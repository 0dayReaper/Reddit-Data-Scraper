They\u2019re trying and will try to make sure you can get into a program or counseling situation that suits your needs best. If you\u2019re at high risk, they aren\u2019t just gonna throw you to the wind, they will do everything they can to get your good help. But they can\u2019t help how understaffed they are.",

They sent me to a \"councilor\" and said 2 months is the soonest ol girl Dr. whatever could see me with an 80 dollar copay. I guess you're right tho they said I can drop out and that took all liability and pressure off of them and put it on Anderson's psychiatric ward 2 for suicide and risk to others. and when I asked if I can get my meds from redfern instead of driving 90 minutes to my home town to do so they said I need a $700 psychological evaluation to determine if I really needed them. yea they're really concerned about my well-being by the way they just tried to get rid of the problem by getting me to withdraw and then trying to make light of the things I've already been through the process of getting prescribed to, just so they could charge me again for the exact same justification for having the prescription. CAPs is a fucking Joke, they're there for the money not because they want to help people. just like many public school teachers they started because it was their passion and now they see the system is broken and they don't care. Just my opinion from when I was going to kill myself, but I'm probably just over reacting it probably wouldn't have been that big a deal if I did right?",

I\u2019m sorry you felt like you were shrugged off and pressured to make decisions for yourself that you didn\u2019t feel ready to make. \nI was purely sharing what I know from the perspective of another student who has been utilizing CAPS resources for nearly 5 years. I was also a student who came in with a suicide threat and was also waitlisted for an entire semester - but you even said it yourself, they tried to pair you with a counselor, I was paired with a temp counselor and used the CAPS on call line when I really really needed someone. It\u2019s the same thing that many other students experience as well - but they\u2019re trying, many of the counselors themselves will tell you that there\u2019s just no feasible way that they have enough staff to see the number of students who need help and that isn\u2019t their fault at all. There is one psychologist employed to see any student who needs an appointment, it is incredibly hard to get an appointment with her, it sucks but that isn\u2019t her fault either. \nI also don\u2019t think redfern was just trying to stick you with a wildly priced medical bill - the process that they ask anyone to do for a controlled substance, I\u2019m assuming because you mentioned the screening, is regulated by the university and is process that is very clearly laid out on the university website. \nCAPS employees can only do so much and sometimes the ethical thing for them to do is refer students to outside counseling. \nAnd for any student reading this who is scared to try to get an appointment with The campus psychiatrist or afraid they won\u2019t get an appointment, you can always go to a general practitioner and discuss anti-depressant and anti-anxiety options with them as well.  \nThis is an obvious issue that should be addressed at the university level and it\u2019s not, in the same ways we can\u2019t blame teachers for underfunding we should blame CAPS for doing what they can with the resources they do have.",

He's got money and time to do that on Halloween and I'm over here shitting out 4 papers and 3 exams while teachers are undoubtedly giving him and others like him a pass, as well as getting money from the school \"so they can go buy a pizza sometimes\" (literal quote from Clemson football representative on justification for college athletes being given money for playing) there are real issues are going on and nada is being done with the 58 million in revenues Dabo and his cronies bring in. Other than more housing for more students for more revenue and still a lack of student resources on campus. \nInstead of paying for 20k of someone's salary they decided to build a slide in the football complex and then however many more for golf carts so their boys wouldn't over exurt themselves on gameweek. There wouldn't be a football team without Clemson, not the other way around and no one seems to care. Revenue builds more revenue, profits go back into football, grants and scholarships go to research so every aspect of every department is lacking somewhere. \nYou can get a Psychology degree here but no one to work at our campus, probably because they know better. We have a computer sciences college yet half of the apps for Clemson do not work. One of the largest Ag schools in the country, we outsource our food supply from a prison food company. \nThere is no money to go around because it's being spent on quantity not quality, Jimbo and the Natty legacy are driving the academics into the ground and driving the prices and amount of students up but not fixing the facilities on campus. \nNo one cares, I can think of nothing more representative of the function of the American economy and political system than Clemson. we talk big shit about going green and fixing the world and all that but then our largest donors are Monsanto and Dow. One of the most popular majors is packaging and food sciences. Yet teaches our students to make trash and process food until it's Soylent Green while boasting this Sustainable Agriculture facade. Not to mention the parallels of ignoring mental health issues or any attempt to remediate the issues the population faces because of their shit. Just empty promises for hope of a future, while raping the earth and sacrificing the environment for monetary gain. \nBut I'm an instate student with no finances to go elsewhere and USC is trash so go Tigs. I understand the reasons for the problems, I also see the solutions and so do most people on campus but it's a \"well what can ya do about it\" kinda thing.\n Is that why there are so many Class of ## structures on campus? They all get together years later like \"Shit... they still haven't fixed this it's been 15 years. we should donate a bunch of money and fix this problem for future students but we control what and how it's spent. \" Or are all of those also a lie, Clemson contacted them through the alumni association hitting them right in the nostalgia gland like Donate to the new sidewalk and we'll put your name on it.",

Multiply that x 2 and that\u2019s what dealing with the VA is like...so frustrating.\n\nUnfortunately, Redfern only has so many NPs, therapists/social workers etc. So those people can only see a certain amount of people per day. If possible make several appoints in advance, hell I would go ahead and schedule a semesters worth of appointments if you can. \n\nThe dark side no one mentions is the scale of mental health concerns at Clemson and colleges across the US. It\u2019s bad. I\u2019m a retired combat veteran, and I\u2019m telling you that. Do whatever you have to in order to survive. If that means taking a break from school, do it. Your well-being always comes first. I\u2019m working on some things with the SVA at Clemson currently, but I want to broaden my concerns to all students and the challenges they face. I don\u2019t know where exactly it is headed yet, but stay tuned. I\u2019m hoping we can make some quality of life changes on campus soon for the good of everyone. \n\nIf you ever need someone to talk to, a study buddy, whatever...I know it doesn\u2019t mean much from some random internet guy...but feel free to contact me. If I don\u2019t have the answers you seek, I know someone who does. The biggest thing is don\u2019t demand PERFECTION of yourself, but rather progress. Try to be a positive thinker, and whatever your mind is telling you that \u201cyou don\u2019t feel like doing\u201d (studying, working out, etc) that is exactly what you do. Of course take breaks and do these things in a healthy way...but suffering and sacrifice builds character. Be the badass you were meant to be. Enjoy the journey, these are the best years of your life, even the challenges can be fulfilling with the right mindset.",

It sucked because she was super helpful. I had to restart the whole process when I came back in the fall. \n\nAs to the wait time? Yeah. I believe it took me a month and I started late in the spring semester. Unfortunately you will see these long wait times with any therapist/psychiatrist at the moment. Mental healthcare is critically ignored in this country. I am nervous for the incoming classes as it doesn't seem to be getting any better in the near future.",

I\u2019ll be honest, I was flagged as a student at risk due to some major depression I was having due to stress and anxiety my junior year. (Spring 2018). Caps was great for me. They reached out and I was instantly put in a weekly counseling program. I went for a year, and as I progressed less visits were scheduled until I was ready. Caps was a wonder for me, and I hope whatever struggles they face now can be alleviated  sooner than later to help more students. Now I\u2019m a huge advocate for people to reach out for help. Even if it\u2019s not caps, just a friend, family, teacher, coach, whoever it may be. I hope things work out for those who have struggled, I certainly think more resources would be huge for them",

Folks at their own practice are likely to be better than the folks at Redfern anyway, unfortunately.\n2. Ask if they have a cancellation list. I don't know if Redfern keeps up with their stuff that well, but it's worth asking and getting on it if there is one. Applies to psychologists and psychiatrists at regular practices as well.\n3. In the meantime, try to find someone you can talk to in case you find yourself in a crisis. Often an advisor in your college or department can provide some help with managing life and school while you wait for treatment.\n\nIf you need to vent or just need someone to talk to anonymously and without fear of judgement, feel free to message me.\n\nIf you find yourself seriously considering self-harm or suicide, please call for help. You are worth it. \n\nCUPD/CAPS after-hours crisis line: 864-656-2222 (ask for CAPS counselor on call)  \nNational suicide hotline: 1-800-273-8255",

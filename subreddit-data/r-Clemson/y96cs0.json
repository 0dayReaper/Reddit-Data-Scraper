Because it's a noon kickoff traffic will horrible getting to the stadium, so get there early. Go to [Clemson.edu](https://Clemson.edu) and look for the link to purchase single game football parking tickets (use. the search bar). The lots available will be C-1 off perimeter road and P8 off Hwy 76. $30 and $20 respectively. It will be a bit of a hike from P8.",

If you end up parking in C1 be prepared for a traffic nightmare after the game.\n\nThere are often opportunities to park for $20-$40 behind the ESSO club.  Go up Oak Street.  Try Hedgerow and Folger.  There's usually several houses that are selling parking in their yards.  It's a good option and close to Esso and not that far from the stadium.  This is probably your best option.\n\nMake your way to Lot 5 if you want to see the Tiger Walk (google it).  Lot 2 is great for walking around and probably getting some free food and meeting tailgaters.  Enjoy your day!",

Definitely get on campus early, it\u2019s a noon game and it\u2019s homecoming so be sure to check out the floats on bowman field! Also, head into the stadium about ~30 minutes before kickoff, just to make sure you can get settled in and take in the pregame stuff. Portal lines can get ridiculous at times. After the game, if you don\u2019t want to fight traffic spend some time taking in the campus or the local shops downtown, there\u2019s plenty of places to drink and watch the afternoon games!",

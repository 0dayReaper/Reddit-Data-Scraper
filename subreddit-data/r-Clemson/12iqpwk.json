    "postText": "Hello everyone, I am super happy as I have been admitted for Ph.D. in Civil Engineering at Clemson. I have been offered a stipend of 25k for the first year (Tuition and healthcare aside). I am enrolled as both a teaching assistant and a research assistant, so I'm not sure if I can earn more than that. Since I am from outside the US, I cannot put that number in context. I would really appreciate it if someone could break it down for me. What kind of housing, accommodation, and travel options will I be able to afford? What are things that I should avoid to live off that stipend?\n\nAnd, does this stipend increase as the year goes on? If anyone could provide a perspective of general trend then I'd really appreciate it.",

He says that stipend is slightly more than his and he has received annual raises. \n\nIn other words, it is a competitive rate and a non-poverty wage... but you'll be living like a student and over-worked.",

You can probably make it work without a car if you live off one of the bus routes. Avoid taking on credit card debt, and keep track of your budget, especially food/drinks.\n\nThe stipend does not increase over the course of the year. You may receive small adjustments each year, but don't plan on it getting significantly larger. Some grad students will take on extra work doing things like tutoring (high school or college), babysitting, waiting tables/bartending, or other similar flexible work, but you will need to check with your advisor/department as some funding sources have limitations. For example, when I was in grad school, as a TA we were not supposed to tutor any undergraduates since we were being paid to teach already and it was potentially viewed as \"buying grades.\"",

            "comment": "South Carolina still has relatively cheap cost of living, especially if you don\u2019t mind living a few minutes off campus. \n\nI recommend trying to find some roommates as it opens up a lot more options in terms of housing. I know people who pay as little as ~500 a month for rent which is a bargain comparatively, of course the trade off is you are off campus. Depending on where you are from there may be cultural differences with roommates so you will likely have to adjust. Living alone is really not feasible unless you have $$.\n\nFor transportation the CATbus system is decent and part of tuition, it has routes that go to most student living complexes and has routes to grocery stores. You could also invest in a bike which will get you to most places in Clemson in 15 minutes or less. \n\nAs the other commenter said, 25k is definitely enough to get by on but you should expect the \u201cstudent life\u201d.",

With the cost of living and bills you won\u2019t live lavishly but you\u2019ll be pretty okay even if you live alone. One consideration is if you are okay living further from campus (cheaper to live and you can cut distance from more nightlife like Greenville, but less public transportation). Also remember you\u2019ll have to pay fees each semester which can take out over $300 per paycheck if you do the graduate fee dispersal. That was a bit of a surprise to me and can really cut the take home salary.",

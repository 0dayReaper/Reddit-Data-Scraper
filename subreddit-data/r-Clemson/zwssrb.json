The University of Bamberg didn\u2019t charge tuition and only charged a then \u20ac75 student transportation pass per semester. Our in-state tuition that we paid as Clemson students during that program paid for the German students to do their exchange at Clemson, essentially.",

He made it seem like you pay regular tuition to your home institution if you do the program through them. It very possibly could be different in the UK, but that might be worth looking into.",

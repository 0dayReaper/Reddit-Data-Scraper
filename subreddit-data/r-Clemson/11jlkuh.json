    "postText": "Hello, I was accepted into Clemson in the Economics (B.A) as a transfer student for fall of 2023. I have almost all the pre-business courses except for the intro to business and calculus 2. At my current institution I am a finance major and i\u2019m hoping to transfer into the financial management major at Clemson, but it would not let me when I was applying so I went with economics. Will there be any difficulty transferring into this program if I was accepted for Economics? The requirements are quite strict and confusing so I am just reaching out to see if anyone has any thoughts or previous experience",

It took for me like 5 minutes of talking, checking my class record, and signing things to transfer from General Engineering to Mechanical Engineering.",

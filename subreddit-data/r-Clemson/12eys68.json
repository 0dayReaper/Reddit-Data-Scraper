I just don\u2019t understand what the callers end game was in this situation.",

At that point in time, it was only slightly unnerving and, believe it or not, felt like an inconvenience (especially if we were mid-exam).  The violence that has now become commonplace had not started yet (except for scattered events).  If I were a student now and that happened, I'd definitely react much differently.\n\nI try not to come off as an overprotective mom.  But, I admit that I tell my son (student) to make sure he knows the exits of places he goes and to be aware of his surroundings.  It's a shame that I should need to even say things like that.  And, like on planes, the closest exit might not be the safest and might not be accessible.  The closest available exit might also seem impossible (think of the VT students jumping out of a two-story window).\n\nA few years ago, my department had a speaker come in that discussed the mass shooting at Virginia Tech.  My department frequently has large events with many people in attendance.  He spoke of how the students and professors in each of the affected classrooms reacted and how the shooter responded.  I wish that I could remember the specifics.",

Too many people today rely on someone coming to save them when we have to be prepared to save ourselves, and the first step to that is being ultra aware of your surroundings.",

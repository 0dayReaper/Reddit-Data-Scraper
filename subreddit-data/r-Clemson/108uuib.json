    "postText": "Just read the email parking services sent out yesterday about the closing of several commuter parking lots (C3, C5 and C8). I usually parked in C1 last semester but with so many lots for commuters closing I\u2019m not optimistic about parking this semester\u2026 \n\n\nThey did make park and ride shuttle every 8 minutes during peak times. \n\nThat never really worked for me tho bc I stay on campus till very late and would have to use late night transit, which could take upwards of 30 min to an hour sometimes.\n\nWhat do y\u2019all think?",

            "comment": "Their email last semester was pretty abhorrent as well; they essentially told people to park in the park and ride lots even if you have a commuter pass. I honestly wouldn\u2019t have had a problem if they refunded some of the cost of the pass if you did that but they didn\u2019t offer any option like that to my knowledge. This semester it will be worse with less spots. Them seem to be double dipping selling unlimited commuter passes then only having park and ride spots available at times when people need them which feels kinda scummy to me.",

It may be difficult to coordinate schedules if you have late classes, but if it's possible you can take your friends home and come back alone for late night things. you can park in any commuter spot after i think 5 so you are all able to drive separately at those times also.\n\ni have a friend who's in my major and most of my classes, carpool has been super clutch for us this year. 10/10 recommendation if you can find people to do it with",

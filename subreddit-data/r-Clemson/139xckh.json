Though, I suppose other apartments might have similar issues. But, more importantly, the maintenance and service is horrid. There is construction taking place 24/7 with debris and materials laying every where. During finals week, I would be awoken with drilling directly above my bed. When the pipes froze, my roommates toilet flooded his room which an unruly amount of time for service to respond. The staff is pretty rude as well in that they will implement fees for any such mishap.",

Personally, the rooms are a little small so if you have a ton of stuff you\u2019ll feel cramped in. However, the rest is fine. The issues with bus have lessened because they\u2019ve been spraying more regularly and we\u2019ve had maintenance respond fairly quickly to stuff over the past year. There is sound bleeding but it\u2019s usually worse from people above or below you and less so room-to-room, weirdly.",

While we were there for two years, at least one building was shut down by code enforcement for structural issues, and a pipe by our water heater exploded, flooding our apartment. They did minimal fixes and then tried to charge us for it when we moved out. I definitely remember seeing roaches constantly but when the buildings are that old it\u2019s probably unavoidable. \n\nWe also got rent cheap as they were trying hard to keep leases. If they are raising prices, doesn\u2019t sound worth it.",

Most people either go to panama city/destin, fort lauderdale if you got money, and anything else is random, hiking, cruising, skiing, national parks. Also depends if your 21 or not. \n\nMy recommendation will always be get the 59$ panamanic card go to pcb/destin and that will get you into a different bar/night club every night and there will be a group of around 500-1000ish people that buy the card too and show up. With the card it covers all covers for the week but if your under 21 you have to go in before 10. I could tell u more if your interested we did that as freshman and loved it split an air bnb for like 5 days cost us mabye 150$ each",

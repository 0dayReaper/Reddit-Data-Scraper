    "postText": "Hi all- I currently go to UConn (sophomore)  and am looking to transfer for my junior year. Part of why I want to transfer is because I am out of state and I don't think I am getting my money's worth. I've considered going south for school for a while, and I think Clemson is one of the best options. Does anybody want to share their thoughts? Pros and Cons?",

Also the mountain biking is pretty fun around here and there's tons of awesome mountains and hour north of here if you wanna do some sick camping. Natural beauty is definitely one of the best perks at Clemson.",

Close knit community with some homely college bars and restaurants.  Lots of natural beauty in the area, plenty of hiking trails and lakes nearby.  Great on campus stadium and football culture (I worked across the street from P&amp;W field, can't believe y'all had to commute all the way there just to watch a game).  Clemson has TONS of clubs to get into and do things with, but the downside is that you kind of have to be part of one to have fun since the town is so small.  There's no meaningful city life (Although Greenville is less than an hour away and it is so, so much nicer than Hartford).  My fraternity was basically all I did when I was in undergrad, but once you find a group you can have a ton of fun around here.  \n\nIf you're from CT and getting in-state tuition idk if I'd recommend transferring if you're concerned about money, but plenty of people love Clem for a reason.",

Everyone loves their basketball in Storrs but it doesn\u2019t really compare to that of Clemson football fans. Other than that Clemson is really similar to Storrs (just a little bit warmer). Fraternities are pretty big here but there is a better bar scene here in Clemson. The downtown area is all located in one area so you can walk between bars. I know going from huskies to whatever is in Storrs Center was always a hassle. A lot of my credits transferred over so it wasn\u2019t really that difficult. But the out of state here is ridiculous compared to the in state at UConn.",

And UConn out of state is more expensive than Clemson out of state, and I think Clemson has more to offer to get moneys worth. I think weather and atmosphere are also big things to help a college experience so Clemson sounds ideal. I\u2019m probably going home next semester and taking classes so I save money from another semester at Uconn then I\u2019ll probably apply for Clemson Fall \u201823 enrollment \ud83e\udd20",

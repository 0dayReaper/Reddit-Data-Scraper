            "comment": "It depends on what you plan to do. I would recommend it if you have the time in your schedule and are interested in it. I think knowing how to code is just so valuable. Although, you definitely don\u2019t need a minor in computer science to know how to code well. Clemson has a lot of workshops for computer science and you could get involved with research that has a software component.\n\nGenerally the classes are tough and take up a lot of time. Also lectures are pretty boring. Personally I find it hard to learn computer science from teachers reading off slides. I learn 99% of what I know from projects. It\u2019s definitely not an easy minor, but can be fun if you are interested. \n\nI knew someone who double majored in psych and comp sci. I\u2019m not sure what year you are in, but the minor is a ton of work. Honestly, if you are going for the minor you might as well go for the double major. It is a bit more, but the minor takes you a big chunk of the way towards a major.",

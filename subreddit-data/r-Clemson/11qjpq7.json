Grad admissions are generally handled by the individual departments/schools, not the office of admissions which handles undergrads.\n\nThey may or may not tell you or even respond. If they don't, do not pester them. If you send a respectful inquiry, it may be interpreted as you distinguishing yourself as a serious candidate worthy of admission, or it may be interpreted as you being pushy and entitled. This will depend on the content of your email but also frankly on the mood/personality of the individual you contact.",

                    "comment": "Agreed. During my time there, there was also a pretty bad ant problem when we first moved in, and the ventilation was poor (some rooms were super hot/cold while the rest of the unit was the opposite). There\u2019s also lots and lots of dog poop around, so something to consider if you have a pet. Last thing is that the area backs up to a neighborhood with some less than great individuals. Often times I heard screaming, saw people being creepy/walking around the complex when they didn\u2019t live here (and I know they don\u2019t), and there were reports of people\u2019s stuff getting stolen. Overall, it was worth it at the price I paid for rent but with the recent price increases, I\u2019d say maybe reconsider unless you love the layout or have some other reason to lease there.",

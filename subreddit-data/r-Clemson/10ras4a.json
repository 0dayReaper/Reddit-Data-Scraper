    "postText": "I got accepted into the honors college and am also planning on rushing. I\u2019ve heard manning is where most girls rushing live and I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m missing out by not living there. Also price. I can\u2019t find actual prices and I have applied for housing yet but $ vs $$$ seems like a big difference. Just wondering if people like honors dorms and if the benefits are worth the extra money, or should I go more for a traditional freshman experience at manning or somewhere similar.",

            "comment": "I loved my honors dorms experience in Deschamps. They are much nicer than Manning I will say, but from what I\u2019ve heard as a guy most of your friends in sororities freshman year will likely be in Manning. Not saying you\u2019ll miss out because you\u2019ll make your own friends that also are in sororities in the honors dorms, but you\u2019re more likely to meet other people in Greek life in manning if that makes sense. \n\nPrice is also a big deciding factor. I will say that the extra whatever it is was worth it to me since the honors dorms are by far the nicest on campus. \n\nBasically, it waters down to pros and cons\n\nManning- More Greek life, more social (not that honors isn\u2019t), less expensive, not as nice \n\nHonors- Less Greek life most likely (although I knew a ton of girls that rushed that lived next to me), more expensive but nicer",

You\u2019re right near everything including the dining hall and the Greek quad. Manning is a much older building so it has a lot of issues with heating/AC and air quality (aka mold). DesChamps on the other hand is pretty new and has study rooms attached to it. Construction on campus has also made it a lot harder/longer to go from manning to the main part of campus. \n\nI loved living in the high rises my freshman year, but if you can afford it, I highly recommend DesChamps. You will not miss out on any part of rushing or your sorority by living in the honors college. You\u2019re going to make friends every where and there are definitely a lot of honors students who join greek life!",

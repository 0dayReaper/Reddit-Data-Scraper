Even though it flooded a few times, the community was outstanding (and so was the partying). Part of college is living in a crappy dorm for at least one year. It gives the chance to meet people who are different from yourself, instead of cloistering yourself in a luxury apartment.",

I enjoyed having the option of taking the stairs since the building wasn\u2019t that tall. If I recall correctly, I think the parking was better in the horseshoe since you didn\u2019t have to move your car for the football games - I\u2019m pretty sure they were already re-doing the parking on that side of campus so maybe someone more recent can comment on that. The horseshoe is not centrally located, and you will have to be prepared to commute almost all the way across campus for some classes. The biggest thing for me, and hopefully this has changed, is that schilletter dining hall closed on the weekends. If schilletter still closes on the weekend and you want to get a meal plan, I would advise that you avoid the horseshoe in general (if possible) unless you\u2019re okay with walking half way across campus to go to the other dining hall for food on the weekends.",

My other sister lived in a high rise, and they were basically the same, but Maudlin had fewer people and a shorter distance to walk down the stairs when it was time for fire alarms to get pulled. Just get a HEPA air filter for any dorm and it will be ok.",

I want to major in Comp Sci but my GPA is a 3.4 and my ACT is a 28. Do you think I would be able to receive a bridge invitation if I am rejected? Also I would like to know the highschool stats of other bridge students thanks :)",

Is it guarantee I will be able to switch and will it be super easy?\n\nNot actually sure about how competitive it is as I'm CPE. As for switching majors, it's a pretty easy process. For my friend, all he did was just contact the engineering department and then ask to transfer and they gave him all the steps. \n\n&gt; And applying for something like communications would help me get in easier?\n\nYes. The idea is that if you're applying for a relatively easy major like English/Communications, the application pool for that major will typically have stats that are lower than that of people who are applying for Engineering for example.",

I feel confident that with your stats you will definitely get into at least the bridge program. Like the people above said, if you\u2019re wanting to extra secure your spot I would apply as Pre-Business and switch to Comp Sci after you get in. You could even apply in as English. I definitely WOULD NOT apply communications. That\u2019s a closed major and they\u2019re a bit picky about who they let in there. Closed majors are Nursing, education, communications, construction science/management, health science, language and international health, sports communication, and psychology. With your scores, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re smart, but if you\u2019re wanting to make 1,000% sure you get in to Clemson (not as a bridge student) I wouldn\u2019t apply as a closed major. Hope this helps!",

I hear comp Sci is full and one of the most competitive majors but im not completely sure how it is at Clemson. Would there be a small chance I would not be able to switch? This is my main worry.

If that's the case, then just take gen eds and whatever you put down for a semester. If you do this, you might have to take an extra semester to graduate, or you could take summer classes. No need to worry about not being able to transfer over to your desired major before registration",

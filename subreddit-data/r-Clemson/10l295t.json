    "postText": "Hi folks,\n\nI have an invitation to the Prospective graduate student weekend at Clemson in February and I am trying to see if current grad students could help me understand what your experience was like.\n\nBeing mindful of the fact that every year is different, in no particular order:\n- What was your experience like? \n- What topics were discussed? Did they more gauge you or make a case for why you should commit to Clemson?\n- Did you have to attend a seminar or academic presentation? or was the tour more a objective presentation of the campus and surroundings, equipment, facilities?\n- Were financial topics covered? like internal grants, travel resources, book scholarships etc?\n- Did the faculty more proactively initiate conversation or wait for you?\n\nI have already connected with a professor (a colleague of my undergraduate advisor) and I will be joining this professor's lab. Since I am planning on skipping lab rotations, I currently wondering about how I should communicate with the rest of the department.\n\nHoping to hear from current grad students.",

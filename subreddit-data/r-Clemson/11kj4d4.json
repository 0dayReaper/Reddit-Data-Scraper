I understand Purdue is the better engineering program but I am happier with Clemson. If I choose Clemson for engineering will I be at that much more of a disadvantage with job placement and salary than Purdue?",

For the most part people don't care where you went to school - only that you can learn fast, do the job, and easy to be around. Just my 2 cents though.\n\nSource: Computer Eng. in the field over 10 years now",

None of my friends in engineering who have a 3.0 or higher have had any trouble getting a job (or, for some of the more academic of them, grad school). However, that's just my personal experience, and I am in engineering, so I don't have many friends... \n\nCan't talk about differences in first-job pay though, as I don't know anybody from Purdue. You can probably find a list of starting salaries broken down by major for Purdue; I know there's a list like that for Clemson. Be careful not to look at the average salaries across all majors, because certain majors are going to pull that number down a lot. However, how much you end up getting out of a college degree depends on how much you put into it. Purdue and clemson teach almost the same material, the main difference are networking opportunities and who your peers and professors are. If you take initiative &amp; ownership over your own studies, I suspect you can get the same out of either program.",

In no way was I ever at a disadvantage in that internship despite being from a program that was ranked lower than Clemsons. That\u2019s just an anecdote, but in my experience in general, you\u2019ll be fine at a school like Clemson and have many of the same opportunities. There may be a few companies that may hire from Purdue more often but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll ever be impossible. I would definitely go where you\u2019re happier.",

I think it will help you better understand Clemson\u2026\u2026.\n\nTimes when so many things seem to be coming unglued are disquieting times. These are disquieting times.\n\nIt always intrigues me how nearly any specific condition of nearly any specific time can find some application in a book that, essentially, was handed down to us by word of mouth through century.\n\nI believe it says somewhere, \u201cI will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help.\u201d\n\nMy thoughts often wander through these upper South Carolina hills that shelter the University that forms a common bond for many thousands of people who have studied here, or taught here or worked here.\n\nThere\u2019s something in these hills that has touched every one of them, something that has rubbed off on them in varying degrees, something that has built within the breasts of all Clemson men and women an enduring spark akin to an eternal pride.\n\nThere\u2019s something in these hills. It was here when a handful of fledgling faculty members greeted a relatively small band of 446 students more than 80 years ago. That was shortly after convict labor had completed an administration building and clock tower that still dominate these Blue Ridge foothills with a timelessness and serenity that impart inspiration and strength anew each time they are looked upon.\n\nThere\u2019s something in these hills that has endeared itself to an endless procession of administrators, teachers, students, secretaries and workman. Hundreds of names pass through my consciousness, names of people who gave selflessly of themselves to build the institution nestled here and who at one and the same time mined the priceless something the hills contain and returned to them still more of it.\n\nI have my names and I see once more the faces and feel again the beloved personalities that go with them. If you will but close your eyes and drift awhile you too will recall the names and faces and personalities of those who meant the most to you while the privilege of being among them was yours.\n\nThere\u2019s something in these hills and from them we have drawn the power to transcend the stresses and strains that tug away to make things come unglued in these disquieting times, the power to cut through such modern concepts \u2013 and such modern facts \u2013 as generation gaps, communication gaps and ideological gaps.\n\nWhere is the generation gap when an alumnus who spent four years in these hills before the turn of the century says, \u201cNext to my church and my home, I love Clemson University beyond all other institutions this side of heaven,\u201d and when a graduate-to-be says, \u201cExcepting only my parents, Clemson has meant more to me and done more for me than anything that has touched my life.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something in these hills that has bound together a man of over ninety and a boy under twenty, something that has given them a common ground on which to stand and a start toward bridging, and eliminating, and gap or any stress or any strain that might try to make unglued whatever they seek for themselves as they move out of these hills into the mountains, the plains, the oceans, the forests, the skies and the storms of life.\n\nWe have all drawn from these hills something to suggest to youth that those over thirty can be trusted and to indicate to those over thirty that the qualities of youth are as sound today as they ever were.\n\nThere is something in these hills that brings together and binds together and holds together men and women of all persuasions, of all heights, sizes, weights, and cultural backgrounds \u2013 something that cuts across every difference, spans every gap, penetrates every wall \u2013 something that makes a man or a woman stand taller, feel better and say with a high pride to all within earshot, \u201cI went to Clemson.\u201d\n\nThere is something in these hills that you and I can\u2019t define and others can\u2019t understand. A wave of warmth always surges through me when \u201coutsiders\u201d say, \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is about you Clemson people, but your undying love for Clemson is admired by everyone I know.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something in these hills and I suspect that\u2019s what it is \u2013 the ability of an institution through the unending dedication and greatness of its people \u2013 its administration, its faculty, its staff, its students and alumni \u2013 to impart to all it touches a respect, an admiration, an affection that stands firm in disquieting times when things around it give impressions of coming unglued.\n\nYes, there\u2019s something in these hills where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness.\n\nJoe Sherman, Class of \u201934",

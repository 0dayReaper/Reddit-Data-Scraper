I\u2019m personally not a fan of the topic of research(that being AI when I prefer developmental stuff) and feel that starting my own passion project over the summer would suit me better. What would you all do?",

            "comment": "Former EUREKAn here.  The advantages of doing a program like EUREKA vs just doing stuff on your own are:  1) You get connected with Clemson faculty who can help to get you into a different lab at Clemson if that's what you ultimately decide to do later on, and 2) to be blunt, formal research through a program like this \"counts\" on your CV in a way that independent work won't, at least in the eyes of most things you might want to do in the future.",

I had minimal interest in my research project and ended up only working maybe 10-20 hours/week on it if that, depending on your grad student or advisor it can be chill or not. \n\nBut the program overall was a ton of fun. You're meeting other driven top students at the school that are gonna go in to do great things. Sure you'll meet some in the honors college, but you'll get close to them in eureka first. I'm still friends with a few Eurekans, and their friend groups as it's changed over the years. Overall 10/10 solely for the social aspect of it. Definitely recommend it, basically you get to become familiar with campus and make friends a month and a half before everyone else.",

You are already in the honors program which will connect you to research opportunities, and when you are looking for work, these independent projects count. My brother was hired into CS on the strength of his independent passion projects from pre-college and some smaller ones he did along the way for clubs and programs - and he was a chem major. If you know what real CS projects look like, and especially if you've written it up in papers before for things like ISEF, JSHS, STS, then your own project sounds like a winner. If you have not done in-depth CS work previously, then I would jump at the offer of mentorship even if it's not your thing.",

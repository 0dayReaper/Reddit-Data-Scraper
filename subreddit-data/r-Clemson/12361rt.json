Best move would be to use salary websites to gauge this since your experience/ prior education will be big factors. On top of that the career center will also probably be helpful for gathering data. When I co-oped they collected data from all the employers to understand what ranges by major and whatnot looked like. \n\nAt the end of the day the best move will be collecting your own data when the time comes. Go in educated about ballpark figures but interview at a few places and see what you get back.",

Be vigilant on walks, call for the cat, and go outside of the house a few times at night and maybe sit on porch. My cat came back when friends were outside smoking cigs. \nAlso use your flashlight at night- cat eyes will glow. That\u2019s how I found my cat the 2nd time she went missing in Clemson \ud83d\ude11\nGood luck and don\u2019t lose hope! Keep us posted!",

We put food and her litter box outside along with her bed so hopefully she can smell it. I\u2019m hopeful that she will come back, but the waiting is heartbreaking. Thank you again! \n\nAlso thank you everyone for the upvotes it really means a lot to me!",

Litter box was outside, he came home that night, I spotted his hiding place the next day and went and got him. If they just got out, odds are they\u2019re still close, so keep up hope!",

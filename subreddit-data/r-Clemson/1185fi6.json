            "comment": "MatSci definitely isn't general engineering, if that's what you meant. I did a Biomaterials concentration in BioE in the late 00s (another option is like biomed stuff). Clemson MSE doesn't show up in many \"prestige\" journal often. Honestly, that's probably a good thing for undergrad not looking to do a PhD. Faculty will be more likely to spend time on teaching instead of chasing grants and traveling for talks and conferences.\n\nI remember Mefford and Blouin being good instructors. Kornev was pretty boring. I'm sad to see that Skaar isn't teaching. Everyone hated that man in the beginning, but he turned out to be a really good instructor. The most important metrics are completion rate\\* and post-graduation employment/income. Make sure you dive into your demographic for those. Some departments are notoriously sexist/racist/ableist and make it unnecessarily difficult for those students to excel.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m currently a senior in MSE. I wouldn\u2019t say the engineering departments are outdated. From what I have gathered, MSE definitely not the most difficult engineering major, but there are some difficult classes. Like any major, a mix of good and bad professors. It\u2019s half science half engineering, so it\u2019s more research focused than other engineering majors. ME and ECE do more math and programming. \nMost classes are in Sirrine or Olin, which are not the newest buildings by any means. As far as I know, there\u2019s plans to build a new building in the Sirrine employee lot starting this summer that will be some mix of MSE/Chem/ChemE. In terms of labs, they\u2019re spread throughout Sirrine, Olin, and the AMRL off campus (very cool facility).",

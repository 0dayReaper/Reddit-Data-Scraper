Im going for engineering and I was wondering if anyone has any reasons for why I should pick one over the other. Both schools are great and offer so many opportunities but, I seriously need more info from students and prospective students on how they decided. Any help is good help!\n\nThanks!",

You could compare the schools all you want but you will be living there for 4 years so just ask yourself where would you rather be location wise for 4 years of your life?",

Do you want to be in a city or more the countryside? Do you like football or basketball? Is religion important? Baptist is more common than Catholics here, though Catholics are here. \n\nFor me, I went to an all girls private high school in DC. I knew I wanted nothing like that (hence private Villanova was out, though I have many friends that went there). I knew I wanted a large public university. Clemson won over penn st for me, but you have to figure out what\u2019s right for you. \n\nAlso I would look at cost. If it\u2019s going to cost you a lot more at Villanova then consider that when you will be making the same as a graduate from Clemson.",

They are both COMPLETELY different. \n\nVillanova\u2019s campus is mediocre, and it\u2019s a lot of stuck up kids from private schools in NJ. The school itself is meh despite its acceptance rate. And they aren\u2019t nearly as generous with scholarships. Basketball is king, lame tailgates, more \u201cprogressive\u201d read: uptight. If that\u2019s your thing though - go for it. Greek life is huge - definitely drives your social life. Know lots of people that went there who initially liked it but then couldn\u2019t wait to get out. \n\nClemson is more laid back, a lot more activities, clubs, etc to meet people. It\u2019s about 3 times bigger than Nova. The academics are GREAT, especially for engineering. Weather is better, surrounding area is better. Football is king (and great tailgates) though soccer is killer, and basketball/baseball are great! As other people have said - think about things like where would you eventually want to end up living, and the weather. \n\nIn the end though visit the schools, and interview the heads of the departments, sit in on a couple of classes; it gives you a much better feel for where you\u2019d think you fit in. Good luck! #GoTigers",

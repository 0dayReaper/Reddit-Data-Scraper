    "postText": "Hi! About to sign a lease at the 320 sloan street apartments. I haven\u2019t talked to anyone who lives there, so I was just checking to see if there was any issues that I should be aware of. \n\nI know it\u2019s kind of grungy and way old, but I mean larger issues with management, maintenance, parking, etc. \n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "I lived there 21-22 and it was great! Management and maintenance responds quick and is really friendly. We also didn\u2019t have too many maintenance issues in general. Parking is super easy. You shouldn\u2019t ever have an issue getting a spot. Walls are a bit thin so if you have neighbors who like to party loud you\u2019ll probably hear them or at least you\u2019ll hear the bass.  It\u2019s also not too far off College Ave so you can definitely hear the traffic but it\u2019s not too bad.\n\nBut yeah if you don\u2019t mind the slight grungyness of it, it\u2019s great! Being able to walk right downtown is amazing. Definitely my favorite place I lived at in Clemson.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, have you heard about \"Carolina Hacks?\" It's a hackathon event organized by a group of high schoolers in South Carolina taking place on April 22nd from 9:30 AM to 5:30 PM. Based on the content of the website, [CarolinaHacks.com](https://CarolinaHacks.com), it is pretty impressive what they've put together. It's great to see young students taking the initiative to organize such an event, and I'm excited to see what they come up with. If you know any talented young coders, be sure to share the event with them! \ud83d\udcbb\ud83d\ude80\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kqm16l6rhgsa1.png?width=2304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0d3428df229f721d4b1a9b8c087720c0d6f64160",

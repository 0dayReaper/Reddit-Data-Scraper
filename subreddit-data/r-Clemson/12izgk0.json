            "comment": "ASL 1010 is kind of a small class with limited seats. It also often gets filled up by athletes who have priority registration. I was able to get in by keeping using Coursicle notifications and even then got in on the last day to add a class. I also then had to send an email to the department registrar to get that last spot at 10 PM. \n\nMy best advice is to use Coursicle and keep checking it often to see if someone drops, although if it's for the fall semester there like won't be much happening with that until August.",

So, what little space is left afterwards is typically gone soon since they are pretty desirable for obvious reasons. That said, hopefully you can. I was in Calhoun last year and loved it compared to most other on campus housing",

So, there\u2019s no guarantee if you go for Holmes instead of Calhoun you\u2019d get it. It\u2019s all based off room and priority ya know. So, it\u2019s impossible to know from the outside looking in which one you could get. But if I had to guess, between these two options I would say you have a better chance with getting placed in Holmes. Just my opinion though",

            "comment": " They do busses its unbelievably expensive. Like cheaper to fly is usually sold out too. If you fly its gonna cost you 140$ out of Atlanta plus even cheap parking adds on 20$. That will get you to Chicago, your still a 2 Hour Drive and could rent a U-Haul for that. You could fly directly into South Bend and Uber everywhere but that\u2019s gonna cost you $700 per person for flights. Or you drive the 1400 miles but assuming it cost 30 cent a mile to drive ur car thats 420$. So you would need a full car for it to be worth that plus takes way longer. So basically it only makes sense financially if you and 3 friends drive together. Thats not even mentioning hotels your gonna have to stay an hour out",

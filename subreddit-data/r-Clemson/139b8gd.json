    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI'm looking for someone to take over my lease or sublease my room from 6/1-7/31. It's at University Village, $377 before utilities, around $20-30 extra per month for utilities, and unfurnished with a private bath.\n\nYou will be sharing a three-floor townhouse with other three males. The room is on the third floor and you can renew the lease. Also one of the roommate has a cat.\n\nIf you are interested and want more information send me a message.\n\nThanks",

    "postText": "Hi, I was recently admitted for the class of 2027, and am wondering if it is worth it or possible to apply for admissions to the Honors program as a freshman. I wanted to apply with my regular application, but never got around to it/got lazy/forgot. I'm wondering if Clemson Honors is worth applying to as a freshman if I do end up committing.",

            "comment": "Definitely do the Honors College program if you are able. You can try after one semester - you MAY be able to apply even still - worth a phone call since they have been known to make exceptions. \n\nThe major advantage is that you will be able to register for the following semester's classes earlier than all your non-Honors College peers (peers is based on your credit hours some of which you may have earned in high school.). The sad stories parents post on facebook about their students not being able to get a spot in a required class tell it all!\n\nAlso, in my parents-opinion, you may get a better professor in the Honors section of any class you take. Think about it - if you were a great prof, wouldn't you rather teach a smaller section of GPA-motivated students than not?\n\nGood luck to you!",

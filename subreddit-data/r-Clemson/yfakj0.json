    "postText": "I\u2019m a somewhat older student and have had extreme trouble getting people to even talk to me. I\u2019ve tried being as kind and friendly as possible and I\u2019m basically a ghost at this point. \n\nThere were a few clubs I wanted to join but some outside stuff ruined half my semester (long story). But I never was able to, and the times I\u2019ve attempted to talk to people, I get completely ignored. I don\u2019t mean over analyzing a non situation; the people flat out don\u2019t acknowledge my existence. It hurts Ngl. \n\nAnyway, that was some context. I just wanted to know if groups will still accept members or if I\u2019m SOL? Any advice on both the groups and on making friends? I don\u2019t think people understand just how soul crushing it can be to be isolated and get shut down. Even at the bars. And it\u2019s not like I\u2019m some guy looking for women; I have a fianc\u00e9. I just wish I could find a friend. To those in clubs: did you find you were able to make friends with your fellow members? And are any active clubs open and willing to allow new members?\nThanks for reading",

            "comment": "I just want to jump in and say that it can be really tough going into school as an older student. I came back to grad school at 29 and felt really out of place. That said, I know several older students that came back to undergrad in their mid to late 20's and found more friends among grad students than their undergrad peers before going into grad school. I would suggest reaching out first to grad students within your program first, then maybe branching out to grad students in other programs.\n\nEdit:\nJust to add on, most majors have clubs (both undergrad and grad) and they tend to be more accepting than regular student social circles",

                    "comment": "Thank you, this is very helpful advice. It might just be my only option. Its likeempathy no longer exists? To illustrate my point, there was a guy in my class I was in two groups with. We actually got along pretty well. I saw him in the library, didn\u2019t big him, just gave him the \u201chey what\u2019s up\u201d nod. He looked me dead ass in the face and did nothing, said nothing, refused to acknowledge me. A simple head nod. I didn\u2019t walk over to him, I didn\u2019t try to interrupt him. I was straight up just gesturing the way people do when they know each other. And then, in one of my major classes, a guy mentioned a certain club. I asked if they still took members. Ignored me. Then a little later (keep in mind this is all PRE class) he was talking about certain classes. I didn\u2019t interrupt, I was kind and friendly, and said \u201cI\u2019m sure you know about it but if you didn\u2019t, there\u2019s a class here where you do that!\u201d Again, smiling and jovial. This ahole pulls basically the same move. He fucking rolled his eyes and said I know. Why is this generation so narcissistic? They make zero effort to even attempt kindness. Empathy is dead and it saddens me. Nobody acted this rude in 2011 and in 2013, the tide began shifting but people were still nice. I wish I had never left because maybe then I\u2019d have a shot. I just don\u2019t get this narcissism and why NOBODY calls them out on it?",

It\u2019d be a little weird because it would be a sublease then switch to a full lease, but it might end up being cheaper than early move in. Not a lot of apartments allow that early of a move-in (because leases typically end in august). Most people don\u2019t stay in Clemson over the summer so there\u2019s a lot of subleasers (check Facebook groups).",

    "postText": "I am curious if anyone knows anything about the abandoned bikes on campus. I would be interested in getting one and learning about how to fix it up if there's even one salvagable at this point, but I don't know the rules on it. \n\nI know there was a place that collected the bikes on campus and people would adopt them, purchasing just for the parts that they needed to repair it with, but I haven't been able to contact them or find anything else out about it since I think there was some sort of fire where they were holding the bikes a few years ago.\n\nIf you know anything about it please let me know!",

I would call Parking Services and find out what they do with those bikes that are not collected by their owners after being impounded. Parking Services may sell them for the $40 fee to the public after so many days. Contact: Parking Services, G-01 University Union, 864-656-2270.",

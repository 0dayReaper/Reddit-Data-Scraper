            "comment": "Few options, i am assuming its for next fall which limits options vs if its spring. Please lmk and i can be more specific i have subleased 5xs (i have been working in the spring every semester) \nDONT SIGN A YEAR LEASE ITS STUPID\n-try to get a lease on campus\n-be an RA i know not ideal for what i think is your final semester:/ but it would be free! You can always use this as your ultimate back up they let almost anyone do it\n-signature does 6 month gotta be early and your rent is like 35% more per month\n- sublease from someone last minute this is your best option: literally every single year you can post in clemson housing in june and saying looking to sublease and you will have 10 people reach out hoping you will take their lease. They are stuck paying it negotiate get them to pay 1 months rent and you pay the other 5. Plenty of kids study abroad its easy enough they pay it either way. You might even be able to negotiate two months rent ( i always have) so really I paid four months rent for a six month lease. The other people may have thought I was dicks, but truthfully, I save them thousands, but asking for money upfront can save you big time. All 5 i of the leases i have signed people paid me 1,000-2,000$ to take for 6 months. \n- if you end up having to sign a year lease at-least live somewhere less than 400$ a month and mentally you can tell yourself that you had a six month lease for $800 a month. \n\nThe biggest thing it\u2019s easy as hell to find high quality ones with good roommates I have ever turned some down before because I thought the living situation might be bad. It\u2019s very very easy to do just not everyone\u2019s willing to do the work.",

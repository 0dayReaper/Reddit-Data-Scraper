I'm hoping for good news about Cleo, too!!\n\n[Clemson Paw Partners ](https://clemsonpawpartners.org/)is a super non-profit near the Central Rec and the Central Library.  They do low-cost (and sometimes free, depending on the situation) spay/neuter, low-cost microchipping, and low-cost vaccines.  I'm going to have my cats microchipped there even though they're indoor cats.  Every once in a while, one slips out the door. 864-986-4884",

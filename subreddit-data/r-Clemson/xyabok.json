    "postText": "I\u2019m a freshman taking calc 3 next semester - options are Teitloff here or Anzur at TCTC. I hear Teitloff is great but tough. I\u2019m willing to drive/shuttle to tctc but that will be a little pain and it\u2019s at 8am M-Th.  I am decent at calc, made As in calc 1 and 2 but at cc dual enrollment in HS - I know Clemson calc will be harder.  Who would you take, between Teitloff here and Anzur at TCTC ?",

Really fun professor and a good teacher. Went straight to calc III from AP calc BC and it was no problem for me. Get the GPA points for Calc III and take it at Clemson.",

Plus @Clemson you'll have more readily available resources (tutoring and classmates) for the class. \n\nIt'll just depend on the professor. Calc 3 at Clemson will probably be harder but who knows. I had Tietloff for diff eq and that was pretty good.",

He lets you do an equation sheet for exams and he is willing to help outside of class. The material itself is not too hard and as long as you put in effort you can do well.",

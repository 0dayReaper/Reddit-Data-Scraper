Yeah they do. But they do on every other college campus as well, and I believe Clemson does a great job of uplifting members of the LGBTQ+ community as well as members of many races when compared to many south east schools. \n\nYeah we are a majority white institution, but people with those violent views about other races and genders are less than &lt;1% of the the population. \n\nIn actuality, you\u2019ll most likely love you experience at Clemson regardless of your background. The Clemson family is very loving of everyone, and you\u2019ll always have a seat at the tailgate party. We bleed orange and purple, not hate.",

            "comment": "as someone who has grown up in the south and been involved with clemson since i was little, questions like these can be really frustrating and hurtful as it continues to perpetuate the idea that the south is nothing but a bunch of backcountry rednecks who haven\u2019t left the 50s (don\u2019t get me wrong they exist but you would have to look for them). i\u2019ve met a few people at clemson who will crack jokes about this aspect of the south and i don\u2019t mind playing along the first or second time, but this attitude ultimately tells me that you haven\u2019t taken the time to get to know a culture you are going to live in past whatever social media representation you have seen. racism, homophobia, and conservatism are everywhere in this country, so to automatically put that label exclusively on the south is narrow-minded. don\u2019t get me wrong, i\u2019ve heard some awful things said about women, LGBTQ+, (two groups i identify with) etc., (i haven\u2019t heard anything racist, not to say it doesn\u2019t happen i just only want to speak to my personal experiences), and you\u2019re always going to have some kind of outrageous stunt from TPUSA (aka affirmative action bake sale - don\u2019t get me started there). however, to ask about the \u2018culture shock\u2019 of the south and in the same breath put racism, homophobia, and extreme conservatism is quite frankly extremely rude to me. that is not southern culture, much less clemson\u2019s.",

            "comment": "If you are worried then it is most likely that you will experience a tremendous culture shock. At Clemson you can feel the conservative energy in the environment. Will a person who is a minority experience racism? Probably not. Will there be people who hide their prejudice? YES. There will be a lot of people who will be nice to others because they have to not because they consider them as equals. If you are perceptive enough you can tell the difference between someone who is genuine and someone who is not. My advice will be to visit the campus before making a decision and get a good feel of the culture. \n\nAnd no, it isn't the same at every university. I left Clemson after one semester, and now I am extremely happy at the University of Maryland. DON'T GO TO A SCHOOL WHERE MOST PEOPLE THINK DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU. Most students at Clemson are smart but they are in-state students that grew up in places with a lack of cultural diversity. They have no clue of what having a truly inclusive university is like and as a result topics or comments related to race will come up often even if it is to show support. Here at UMD it is barely a topic, everyone is used to diversity and people don't talk about race issues or homophobia unless you belong to a club with that particular aim, or something significant happens that makes the news. Everyone is considered equal and THERE IS NO NEED TO CONSTANTLY REMIND EACH OTHER ABOUT IT, you can just feel a genuine inclusive energy. \n\nAnyways, I can only speak about my experience, for some people Clemson will be the perfect fit, definitely visit the campus first for a couple of days.",

                    "comment": "As someone who goes here and has lived in SC for my entire life\u2026 you are entirely and completely mistaken.\n\nYou wear the South like an outfit without understanding the effect it and its intolerant culture have on the people who live here out of necessity and out of family belonging, not out of \u2018aesthetic\u2019 or personal pleasure. I won\u2019t make any definitive assumptions about your identity, but I will ask whether you have considered whether the fact that the south has been nothing but friendly and hospitable to you is because its culture was specifically designed to accommodate people like you, not because it welcomes everyone.\n\nHarmful conservative culture is present in this state and especially in this part of the state. White kids raised on intolerant ideologies say horrible things to and about queer students and POC here all the time, and I hardly flinch at the college\u2019s main republican organization condemning homosexuality or the thousandth confederate flag on someone\u2019s rear windshield.\n\nTo OP, it is vital for your happiness that you understand the existence of such troubles at Clemson. They are actually, really present and among the deepest problems the University faces. Equally important for you to understand, though, is that this university has a vibrant and accepting campus community that represents pretty much the same level of acceptance and understanding you can expect at any college. The actual body of students and professors are, more often than not, some of the most understanding and encouraging people you will meet. The collection of multicultural clubs and organizations, including numerous racial, ethnic, and LGBTQ-oriented organizations, are some great examples of those communities fighting for universal acceptance at Clemson.\n\nI am a queer student, and many of my friends, including my partner, are students of color. We have not personally experienced aggression from intolerant people, so for the most part I would say that Clemson is a safe place to be in terms of those identities, but I have certainly met people who have had more negative experiences with intolerance on campus, and I\u2019d be lying if I said that I haven\u2019t shared words with some people who very publicly have voiced that they didn\u2019t want me or my friends around.\n\nHowever, if you want to come here, you definitely should. There are struggles here, like anywhere else, but the community here and almost everyone I\u2019ve ever met, even those heavily involved in more \u201cconservative\u201d campus cultures, like Greek Life or in-depth sports involvement, have been overwhelmingly pleasant and accepting people. Coming here over the other colleges on my list has been one of the highlights of my entire life, and the opportunities for involvement here are deep and fulfilling.\n\nFinally, to Thoth, who I am replying to, please understand that the happiness and life experience of EVERYONE you know who doesn\u2019t look and act like you do is gained in spite of conservative southern culture, not because of it. The south is inherently intolerant, a fact which places like Clemson are slowly starting to break, but ideologies like yours are the primary factor holding us back. I beg that for yourself and anyone close to you effected by intolerance and hate, you can reassess this viewpoint.",

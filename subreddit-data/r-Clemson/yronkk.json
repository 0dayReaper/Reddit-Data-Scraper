    "postText": "It seems like campuses security has had enough, or enough people got hurt that they had to address e scooters. In a recent email they address how the school is going to handle e scooters form now on. They have made a new set of rules for them.  And I am so glad. \n\nHere a summary what happing. \n\n[University Safety Guidelines for e-Scooters](https://news.clemson.edu/university-announces-safety-guidelines-for-e-scooter/)\n\nThe TLDER is e-scooters are being held to the same standards as bikes.\n\nThe biggest rule is that on certain sidewalks they are no longer allowed. They are not allowed in buildings any more or just left anywhere. It says they should go on bike racks form now on. \n\nAlong with the new rules there will be consequences for those who brake the rule. For those who do not park their scooters correctly can be confiscated. Starting November 15 campus police will start talking to those who brake the new rules. On December 1 they will start fining those brake the rules. \n\nNow as someone who gotten hit by scooters I can not wait for this. I\u2019m tired of walking on pedestrians only sidewalks and getting swiped by a scooter. \n\nI can\u2019t wait to see if people start to get fine.",

Living off campus you normally have to get to campus at least 30 min beforehand to make it to class unless you have an early morning class when parking isn't as bad. Also the likelihood of having back to back classes and having to walk from dillard to P&amp;A is super low. Miss me with the tight schedules BS.",

People with nice bikes that serve Know what they\u2019re doing because they\u2019ve ridden them forever. They know not to get to close and they know how to maneuver without being a dick. I ride my bmx around campus all the time. But the scooters are ducking nerdy as hell. I mean it\u2019s a razor scooter with a battery. 9 year olds think you\u2019re a dork lol",

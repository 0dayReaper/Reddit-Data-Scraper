Anyway, Tottenham Hotspur supporters meet at Community Tap Trailside in The Commons by Unity Park. The official SC Tottenham supporters group helped them pay for NBC Pub Pass so they should be able to get all of the matches. Only reason I asked who your club is is because they only have 2 TVs in the place so if your club is playing at the same time as Spurs you may not be able to get it put on.",

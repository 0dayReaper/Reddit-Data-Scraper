If you are able to visit and take a tour, do so as well. Take your time on your common app essay as well as completing your activities section. Get familiar with the SRAR as you will need to complete that as well for Clemson. In addition to your common app essay, my son wrote a short \u201cwhy Clemson \u201c essay. FYI/ the EA SAT 75% score was 1450. Just want you to be aware as their website doesn\u2019t reflect that info. EA was new this year- and we learned that at the admitted student day. Hope this helps!!! Good luck! Go Tigers!",

    "postText": " Hey all, I posted about this last semester and wanted to make everyone aware again of a new Creative Inquiry opportunity under Dr. Laura Redmond next semester, as we are actively looking to recruit a couple more undergraduate students to the team.\n\nThe creative inquiry will take on [NASA\u2019s Micro-g NExT](https://microgravityuniversity.jsc.nasa.gov/about-micro-g-next) challenge, in which undergraduate students design, build, and test a tool or device that addresses an authentic, current space exploration challenge. This overall experience includes hands-on engineering design,  test operations, and public outreach. Design proposals are due at the end of October, and if approved, there is the potential to travel to the Johnson Space Center to test the tool in a simulated environment.\n\nWe are recruiting a couple more fully dedicated undergraduate students for the Fall 2023 and Spring 2024 academic year, who can dedicate around 5+ hours per week to the project (the associated course will be 3 credit hours). We are mainly looking for engineering majors, but are open to others joining as well. The skills that we are looking for include, but are not limited to:\n\n\\- Testing/prototyping\n\n\\- Structural analysis\n\n\\- Videography/3D Modeling/Visual media and design\n\n\\- Proficiency in CAD (SolidWorks or AutoCAD)\n\n\\- ME shop access and tool experience\n\n\\- 3D Printing\n\n**If you are interested, please fill out the Google Survey application below:**\n\n[https://forms.gle/x2KGvBQs555sH9C49](https://forms.gle/x2KGvBQs555sH9C49)\n\nFor questions, please reach out to [adensie@clemson.edu](mailto:adensie@clemson.edu)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tdbi0nyerbta1.jpg?width=1700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d839a06c0dc51ffd19ed64e52d608a30c50dad20",

However, this requires that you participate in the same CI 3 semesters in a row, and it is not guaranteed that this CI will continue after Spring 2024",

    "postText": "Hello Clemson gen chem students! I am offering free chemistry help for general chemistry students via YouTube. Every Wednesday at 7pm I have an interactive live stream on general chemistry topics. This week we are working through a titration of a weak acid with a strong base. You are welcome to join in and ask questions in the chat and request other chemistry topics/problems for future live streams.\n\nI have my masters in chemistry and was a college professor (mostly general chemistry, but a bit of organic as well) for ten years. The YouTube channel is Chem Help ASAP (link here: [https://www.youtube.com/c/ChemHelpASAP](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChemHelpASAP)) I hope I can help you understand chemistry a bit better!",

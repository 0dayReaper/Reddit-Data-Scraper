    "postText": "Basically I have a class I need to take over the summer and I\u2019d prefer to do it at a community college since it\u2019s way too hard at Clemson. So I\u2019d like to take it elsewhere and transfer the credit over. How exactly do I do that? Do I just go to the community college website and apply? Are there some forms I have to complete for Clemson? Just confused and need someone to describe the process in steps.",

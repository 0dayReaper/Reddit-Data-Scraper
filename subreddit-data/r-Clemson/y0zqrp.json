    "postText": "I'm a high school senior with 2 Spanish credits and Clemsons requirements say I should have 3 of the same language, will they still accept me and if so, will this affect my chances of being accepted and getting scholarships. By the way, I also have 2 more Spanish credits I earned by dual enrolling in a local community college but I don't believe they transfer.",

If you are out of state, the credits may be less likely to transfer (in state have better chances anyway) \n\nScholarships are very hard to get at Clemson because they don\u2019t give a lot of them out. If you fill out fafsa, there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll get some loans. The valedictorian at my high school only got 2500 from Clemson (and her weighted gpa was almost perfect)",

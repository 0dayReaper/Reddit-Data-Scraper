They do not represent an infestation or awful sanitary conditions in my mind, they just represent living in a giant humid swamp area. If there are little baby roaches, that is way grosser because they are actually breeding tbh.",

Sushi hella overpriced when 356 was just up the road in a better location with better sushi for lower prices.\n\nPixie and Bills also but it's further out from campus and just feels irrelevant, idk anyone who's ever eaten there.",

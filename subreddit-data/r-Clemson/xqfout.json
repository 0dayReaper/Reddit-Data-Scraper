When I sent in a rental inquiry to UV, they told me that there were no spots available for male move-ins at this time. I have already sent in an application to The Reserve and I\u2019m just waiting for them to give me some info back. Is there anyone on this subreddit looking to sublease their apartment to me in UV? Any other help with this would be greatly appreciated.",

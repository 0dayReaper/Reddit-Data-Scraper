Hot so hot it burns you too. Though it's just the growl of the tiger it was written in a syncopated way. More and more they yell for the Tiger. Everywhere you go today, they're shoutin: Where\u2019s that Tiger? Where\u2019s that Tiger? Where's that Tiger? Where's that Tiger? Hold that Tiger! Hold that Tiger! Hold that Tiger! \nWoo hoo, Woo hoo hoo hoo\nC L E M S O...N!\nEdit: I feel so cringy. Please don\u2019t get mad at me tigers",

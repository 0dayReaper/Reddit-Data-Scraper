It was in the 99 percentile when I scored it last year for both the national and user samples. \n\nNot going to lie though, colleges are finicky, I \\*could\\* see Clemson rejecting them depending on the rest of the application.

The variance in college admissions is super high, and you need at least a couple schools you feel confident in that you will be accepted.  I applied to like 9-12 schools and that\u2018s normally kind of on the low end if you\u2019re gunning to get into a top program. It\u2019s not uncommon to apply to 20+ schools, with a full range of acceptance rates. The highest acceptance rate of a school I applied for was like 90% while the lowest was like 3-5%. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCost is also a factor. Clemson was like $30,000 a year cheaper than my favorite school I applied to and the favorite school I was accepted to.",

    "postText": "So I went to pick up my cap, gown, and hood today for graduation, however, when they asked me what type of degree I had I said \u201cMasters of Science in Education\u201d and I think the person at the front heard the science part of my statement but not the education part as I have a hood with a yellow trim and not light blue. \n\nI don\u2019t think I can return it as I already opened the packaging. \n\nSo if anyone is looking for an science masters hood, I have one that I won\u2019t use. I live in Greenwood so I\u2019ll probably have to mail it but I will be back in Clemson to get my *correct* hood probably on Sunday.",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was a Clemson student from Fall 2021 to Fall 2022. I left Clemson after struggling and suffering a massive GPA drop. Now I am at a community college back in my home state and finding my Clemson credits are wearing me down. Many of the schools I'm looking at for engineering have requirements that are just out of reach for me and I wish I could drop some of that baggage.\n\nDoes anyone know if Clemson has ever allowed academic Bankruptcy? Please let me know where I can go to find more information if not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you",

            "comment": "There is a procedure called Academic Renewal that can put aside your previous class records. The classes will still be on the transcript but the GPA will be removed. This requires a 2 year leave from Clemson to apply. I found info on it here: https://www.clemson.edu/academics/eligibility/documents/how-to-appeal-academic-renewal-fall.pdf\n\nIf you just want to remove the GPA from 2 classes (D or F grade) you can use Academic Forgiveness. That will boost your GPA some. You just need to ask an advisor to help with that.",

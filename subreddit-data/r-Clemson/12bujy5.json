Idk if Professor Scruggs is still teaching but he was my favorite so talk to him.  For me this class was the hardest out of the four calc classes I had to take. Also feel free to pm me Thursday if you have questions. I still have all my old notes. Also Dr. Burr has YouTube videos on all of the lessons.",

Definitely practice the fundamental knowledge that the exams are based on and search for similar questions in the book to practice.\n\nPerhaps things have changed since I took the class, but to me it was akin to training to be a single engine Cessna pilot, then you're tested by being thrown into an F-18 and told to do carrier landings at night. I was extremely not a fan of the games that the Math department plays with 1080.\n\n-----\n\nTo any 1060 students reading this:\n\nAfter getting a D on my first go (and retaining basically nothing), I went to Greenville Tech the following semester (summer) and took the bridge program equivalent (MAT 140) and it was literally the same curriculum just with tests that weren't skull grinds; they were still challenging, but Yamashita set the expectations for the class early and he always stuck to them.\n\nEnded up with an A, learned more, retained everything, and learned some valuable life lessons from Yamashita that I personally feel that no one at Clemson's Math department could have taught me.",

In that time I could have finished basically all my math, all my Physics, and all my Intro to Engineering classes; and I probably could have done it all with strong A's and B's.\n\nNote: for math, everything up to and including Differential Equations is transferable; I ended up doing 2, 3, LinAlg, and DiffEQ at Tech and I did way better in those classes at Tech than I would have at Clemson.",

Go to office hours, it will help you and show the professor you are putting time in. The best way to do well in math courses at this level are to do practice problems. I also recommend setting a goal for amount of time to spend on the class per day, on top of homework and the class itself of course. So maybe like 15 mins of studying per day, exclude Friday and Sat, on top of regular time spent on the class.",

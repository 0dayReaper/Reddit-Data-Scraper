    "postText": "Hi there\n\nI\u2019m a current sophomore who\u2019s made the decision to switch to engineering (yes I know I\u2019m insane), specifically biosystems. I\u2019m currently a conservation bio major and I\u2019ve been able to hold a pretty good gpa (3.6) with some 3000/4000 classes included in that. I know engineering is pretty infamous for making people switch out or pull their hair out for 4 years, but is it really that bad compared to other STEM majors? Just trying to see what I\u2019m getting myself into. Thanks!",

The main killer classes are the introductory classes such as the first couple calculus classes and the first few major specific classes. For ME it was statics and dynamics and then the rest seemed not so bad and a breeze compared to it.",

Gpa doesn't matter as much in engineering unless you're trying to go to med school or something like that afterwards. Plus biosystems is pretty cool in my experience (just one tech elective). \n\nEngineering gen eds can kinda suck but calculus is easy once you start to wrap your head around it. Just takes time (so study). I can't tell you about Biosystems specific classes tho.",

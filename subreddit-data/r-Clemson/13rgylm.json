That was a plus. \n\nHauling everything up stairs to the 4th floor on move in day with no elevators was a definite negative.\n\nHave a great year. Go tigers!",

Living in the shoeboxes was usually a pretty tight community in the whole building which is cool. Big downside is the washing machines were usually always full since there\u2019s not a lot of them for the number of rooms. Also you\u2019ll have a sink in your dorm, definitely don\u2019t drink out of it for a week or two after you move in and come back from winter break. Water came out brown for a little bit in my room.",

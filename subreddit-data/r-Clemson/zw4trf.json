    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all, future tiger here in \u201823 and I have some questions on how the living learning communities work with dorm selection. Can I live in a dorm if I don\u2019t plan to join its LLC, or would I have to live in one without an LLC if I don\u2019t plan on joining one? (For example, can I live in McCabe Hall if I\u2019m not in ROTC)\n\nCan\u2019t seem to find this online, so any information about LLC\u2019s would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",

            "comment": "I believe it depends on the LLC but for most freshman LLCs, you don\u2019t need to be in the community to live in the dorm. There might just be a specific floor that is designated for the LLC, but unless it explicitly says only for LLC, you can definitely live there as a normal student. I did that my freshman year in the high rises.",

            "comment": "Most LLC's don't take up the whole building. So there are plenty of more spaces available. When you get to time for housing you'll be able to see what spaces are available. I would say have at least three residence hall options in your mind. The one benefit of an LLC is the majority have enough space you will get the spot if you want, however don't join if you're not interested as there is a class component for them.",

I had several female friends that lived in McCabe their freshman year, and they were not part of ROTC. I lived in Holmes and was not part of CONNECTIONS or the Teaching Fellows. The only exception is that to live in CRIBB &amp; DESCHAMPS, you have to be in the Honors College. I am in the Honors College, but still chose to live at Holmes my Freshman year with a friend that was not in the Honors College.",

I (and my roommates) are looking to re-let/sublease our apartment for this Spring. I am moving to Colorado towards the end of the month, and am looking for someone to take over the apartment from February onwards. It is $775 monthly, with all utilities included except electricity. I am willing to negotiate rent/move-in dates as well. It is non-furnished, but, we're happy to give the next owners our furniture\n\nCurrently, there are no roommates - so whoever takes my bedroom would have the apartment to themselves or can choose their own roommates to take over the empty bedrooms. The Lofts is home to a lot of great amenities, including 24/7 access to the gym, pool, hot tub, tanning beds, and clubhouse which features free printing, study rooms, pool &amp; ping pong table, and more. Valet trash and free parking is included across the complex as well. \n\nI've loved living here &amp; have worked at the leasing office for the better part of 2 years, please feel free to reach out with any questions, inquiries, or more photos/details!",

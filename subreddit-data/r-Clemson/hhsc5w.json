Since that time, countries have found that social distancing and face coverings have proven effective at reducing the spread of COVID-19. \n\nThe University is implementing the same standards for campus life. Having a city ordinance in the town will help affect student and employee behavior, and constant testing will allow the school to react to new cases. \n\nIn the spring Clemson was caught off guard. Since then the University has developed a plan for safe learning based on best practices proven elsewhere. Proceed with caution, but proceed nonetheless.",

Online delivery options will be available for most every class. Details include:\n\n-The University\u2019s goal is for at least 75 percent of all courses to have some class periods dedicated to in-person interactions among instructors and students.\n\n-All classes with in-person components will also be blended with online components.\n\n-Cameras and microphones will be installed in more than 400 classrooms to allow for live video streaming and recorded delivery of instruction.\u201d\n\nDirectly copy and pasted from the email. I think the heading and that last point pretty much implies that the lectures and classes with the ability to do so will record lectures to post online. Not every student will be able to sit in on lectures once the classrooms meet social distancing requirements, they\u2019re simply too small in a lot of cases. That means that the class content and lectures will HAVE to be recorded and posted for all students to access. Or at least zoom meeting at lecture time. Also, not every class has the flexibility to be able to be adequately taught through an online format and need hands on work in a classroom or laboratory setting. There is no one-size-fits-all but they\u2019re trying to include as many classes and people as they can. It\u2019s not going to be easy for any of us, but if you feel so poorly about the prospects of the fall then maybe you should think about taking a break.",

Just because we criticize admin and their poor decisions doesn't mean we love Clemson any less than you do. If anything we love Clemson more because we are actually thinking about the Clemson Family lives that are potentially at stake. Maybe we would complain less if the university administration actually listened to us and took our concerns into consideration (like real leaders do) instead of dismissing us and telling us that everything is fine and to just trust the plan.

We are still exposed to the students who are in-class. We have extra work to do to accommodate both in-class and online learners. \n\nCombine that exposure with the age of the professors and it\u2019s a time bomb. I would expect schools which are proceeding with in-person learning to be shut down as soon as the first group-infection is traced to one student sitting in the classroom. Then come the lawsuits for unsafe workplace and negligence. \n\nFull disclosure: I\u2019m a Clemson alumni that lives in the area. I\u2019m a teacher, but not at Clemson. However, all of us in the teaching profession from elementary school through college are facing the same problem with covid and in-person instruction.",

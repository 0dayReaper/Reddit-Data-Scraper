The single game ticket lottery will be this summer and you can enter for each game you want, keep an eye out for that! I never had problems finding tickets for any of the games I didn\u2019t get in the lottery even as a freshman\u2014people will switch tickets/sell.",

Ask around to people when you get here bc there\u2019s usually buy/sell groups on GroupMe. I\u2019d recommend joining Iptay Collegiate Club! It gives you extra priority in the lottery. I paid all 4 years in advance for a lower price and I got all but one home game ticket my freshman year. I think there\u2019s usually tables at orientation for that or you can join online",

If that fails, check with other students for tickets/check the groupme or facebook ( https://www.facebook.com/groups/578380755912019/?ref=share&amp;mibextid=S66gvF ) to buy a student ticket off somebody. But the lottery has always been good to me with the Iptay priority so you shouldn\u2019t have any problems especially if you join that! Maybe have to buy a game or two from another student but nothing crazy.",

My 5th year I didn\u2019t do band and it was the first year of online rollout and it was still like released in sets based on seniority and you did need to be logged in immediately and try to get them. Was kind of a pain but whatever lol",

Last year during the summer was when we made the switch and bc it took so long we didn\u2019t get to enter for season tickets until close to the end of summer. But like people have said above, join facebook groups and groupme chats to get tickets for the games. General rule of thumb for getting tickets at a better price is to wait until the day of/right before the game to buy tickets. normally people will overprice them by a lot but if they don\u2019t think they can sell them they\u2019ll drop the price close to the time of the game. \nFor a better chance of getting tickets when you do the lottery for single game tickets, join iptay collegiate club. it\u2019s 50$ for yearly membership and boosts your chance of getting more tickets for the lottery and for getting season tickets. also attend other games too, not just football, because you will earn points from attending these games that will also boost your chances. make sure to download all in rewards so you can start getting points. Hope you enjoy your freshman year and hope this helps some. Go tigers!",

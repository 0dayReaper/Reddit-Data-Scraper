For the small percentage of people who actually think Clemson is seriously considering closing, I am not a meteorologist, but the forecast:\n\nIt will most likely rain Friday starting after noon, winds topping out at about 10 mph (classified as gentle breeze). Never getting more than an inch of rain per hour.\n\n30% Chance of rain on Saturday (high of 63% at 3 a.m.) winds never topping 10 mph.\n\nI would get ready for that exam and GameDay, Clemson doesn't close.",

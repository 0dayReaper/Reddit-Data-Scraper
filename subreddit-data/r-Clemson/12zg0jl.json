I'm passing through greenville and the clemson area (highway 123) this week to go to the mountains and I want to stop and get some BBQ for lunch. You guys have any good recommendations? I'd like to try the SC mustard style.\n\nAlso looking forward to playing you all in November, should be a fun game.",

No frills.\n\n- Moe's downtown is great Alabama style BBQ and has a really nice atmosphere with a brewery next door and outdoor lounge area.\n\n- Local Cue on Haywood road is great BBQ in a more sports and games bar-oriented atmosphere.\n\nIf you're looking in the Clemson area, it would be a shame not to go to Smoking Pig. Great food and a nice outdoor area. It's not on your way, though, would be a 20+ minute detour from 123.",

How would you describe your dining hall experience at Clemson as it pertains to socializing, eating with friends, eating alone, studying, atmosphere, vibes, etc. and what could make the experience better? All opinions are welcome! I would so appreciate your feedback as this will help future students with their dining hall experiences! Thank you so much!! :)",

            "comment": "Socializing kinda stinks as you get up in years since not everyone has a meal plan or lives on campus, but I feel like Schlitter always has the best vibes. The staff is awesome, food is actually really good in my opinion, and I always see someone I know it feels like. \n\nCore is just meh. Food is average on a good day, the dish belt being in the middle of the dining hall makes everything smell bad anywhere near it, and the layout just kinda sucks. It\u2019s one of those places where I pop in and out to eat if I have time.\n\nDouthit is the weird one. The food can be amazing on a week with good rotations and just awful on bad ones (looking at you soup and sandwich station.) I feel like it\u2019s one of the most social dining halls, but really only at dinner. Most people don\u2019t even know they have lunch, and it\u2019s so barren during that time. Great place to study though.",

Like walk around for 5 minutes trying to find a seat crowded. I cant go at another time because my schedule. The food is good once a month but it\u2019s always greasy. Just overall disappointing.",

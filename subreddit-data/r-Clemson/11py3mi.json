    "postText": "I got grader assistantship position (10hr/week) for a starting semester in the mechanical department. My tuition fee is waived and likely to be awarded with a minimum stipend. Is this offer good to have a first step to the university? \n1. I am just worried if this position wont continue in further semesters. How are the chances and trends that they could hire me again? \n2. Even for the starting semester i wont be able to cover living expense from the stipend. Can i get enough on campus jobs for the other 10 hour to cover the expenses? Does university discourage working on campus or anything like that?",

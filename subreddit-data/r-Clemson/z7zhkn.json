    "postText": "hey guys I got an mip earlier this week. Does this affect scholarships or anything? I'm tight for money and paying $700 is two (months) worth of rent. If anybody has any experience with this stuff I'd like to know. Some questions running through my head are how long does an MIP stay on your record, does it affect scholarships, and does it affect job opportunities down the road?",

Just try to avoid getting another one.\n\nAlso, if money is tight, you really need to find another place to live. $1400 a month is probably the highest I've heard for Clemson, and there are so many cheaper options.",

I\u2019m a non-traditional student and I\u2019ll have to pay my way through college and take on student loans, so I\u2019m weighing my options. As I live in Greenville/Spartanburg, the two programs I\u2019m primarily considering are Clemson (already accepted as a transfer student for ME but plan to switch to CS) and UofSC Upstate. I\u2019m closer to Upstate, but Clemson\u2019s an overall better school with a larger program. That said, Clemson is more expensive and a longer commute. I\u2019ve also read some mixed reviews on Clemson\u2019s program, and I\u2019m curious if it really offers much benefit over someplace like Upstate for someone in my position.\n\nBoth programs are ABET accredited and I plan to pursue an MS later on anyways. Thoughts?\n\nThanks.",

That drive, even if you think it\u2019s \u201conly a hour,\u201d will be awful on 85 going in and out, not to mention that you won\u2019t be able to get involved in a lot of things on campus that way.",

I\u2019m considering commuting because doing so would save me several thousands of dollars per semester and driving a little extra just seems like a good tradeoff, but leaving at 6:30 am to make it to an 8:00 class seems like it would get old pretty fast.

The Co-Op program is well run and pre-pandemic the career fair was as well.\n\nFor CS, everyone teaches the same fundamentals, so you won't miss out on much besides a few interesting elective CS courses. You might even receive better instruction ar Upstate since I assume it's smaller class sizes.\n\nThe decision points for you are going to be the costs, the commute, and how well Upstate's career programs set you up for success and opportunities. The first internship and the first job are the hardest to get, so I would look into the stats at Upstate.",

That, as well as having a greater selection of electives and more students to network with are some of the reasons I\u2019m a little torn. Upstate\u2019s CS program averages only around 150 students total so faculty/student ratio is definitely better but having fewer elective options is a little concerning. However, if since I\u2019m planning on getting my MS later it may not matter. Thanks",

And if you\u2019re 100% footing the bill then I\u2019d honestly go with a community college. It\u2019s really one of those degrees where once you know the fundamentals you\u2019re set. An employer won\u2019t care if you\u2019re self taught or about the name of your university. \u201cCan you do x, y, z tasks? Can you show competency in A, B, C languages? Show me how you\u2019d fix this problem.\u201d is more what they want from you. And you can get that level of competency without a degree, or through less expensive types of education than a 4-year degree. I graduated in psychology but I\u2019m doing compsci stuff on my own  now that I\u2019m graduated so I can use that in combination with my psych/research knowledge.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to self teach, but if you want the environment of a university then I totally get that. I need that for learning (speaking not coding) languages. But as a person that graduated at a four year college, it\u2019s okay and sometimes better to do certain degrees at an associate\u2019s level and then build on your understanding through self teaching. And CS is definitely one of them.",

Since the programs are similar in rigor, and the networking you do in USCU are people in your community, plus the fact that you want to pursue a MS means you\u2019ll want to make some connections with your professors. Not just for recommendations but for mentorship and a better learning experience. It\u2019s harder to do in a large program where professors see a lot of students in lecture classes and you\u2019re just another face in the auditorium (or on a screen). I\u2019m amazed that I was able to have strong enough relationships with my professors (I was worried specifically bc of COVID) that I would be able to have good recommendations should I need them in the future. And you can always go to Clemson for an MS/Ph.D. once you\u2019re done with the bachelor\u2019s.\n\nAnother thing I want to say: have fun with those humanities/social science courses! I waited till my senior year to do some of them (lit and comm, and intro to political theory) and I treated the lit and political theory ones like they were book clubs. Comm was a bit more difficult but it was still an interesting break from the other stuff I was learning. Try to get something on sociology or anthropology too.",

They offer some pretty interesting (optional) classes after you complete degree requirements but other than that the classes are unusually hard and there aren\u2019t any outstanding benefits to the program compared to other universities. Also, as a former undergrad in CS at Clemson, most classes have a \u2018fail quota\u2019 that they are expected to meet which basically means that it is expected a certain number of students fail the class and if there are more people passing than the expected fail rate the teacher gets reprimanded and told they need to make their class more difficult. If the class is stupid easy I can understand this policy but in the classes I have been in where the teacher has literally mentioned they\u2019ve been told too many people are passing and the class is difficult its frustrating. Also, a lot of teachers are at the university for research purposes and are required to teach to stay employed and i\u2019ve noticed those teachers couldn\u2019t give two shits about students (i.e. responding to emails, inputting grades, helping students understand, and keeping up to date with their resources online)",

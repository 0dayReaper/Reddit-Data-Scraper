    "postText": "so i\u2019m pretty sure i have over 3 unpaid parking citations for expired meters etc etc. however today i got fined $160 for parking in C-1 while having an east park and ride pass (to be fair my roommate told me i could park in c1). it\u2019s clear they didn\u2019t impound my car on my fourth ticket, and i\u2019ve been told they don\u2019t take action for unpaid tickets but i don\u2019t know if this is true. parking services is the absolute scum of clemson and an exploitative system that takes money from students. i don\u2019t think i\u2019ll be paying my citations unless i\u2019m going to jail or am being prevented from graduating. does anyone know what the absolute worst consequence is for unpaid citations?",

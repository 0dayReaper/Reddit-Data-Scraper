    "postText": "For the past few weeks, I've been having issues with my internet at my apartment (ever since the semester started back up). We use Vyve Broadband, and as much as I hate it, it's the only thing that is provided on our block besides cellular wifi's. I was wondering if anyone in the area who uses Vyve has been having up and down speeds... Sometimes my speeds are 400+mb download, while other times they float around 10-20mb, sometimes even 2-6mb. My upload speeds have been high and consistent, but I don't know if it is Vyve themselves or something wrong with our internet setup, even though plugging directly into the modem still gives low speeds. Is anyone experiencing the same issues? Or should I go ahead and call them so they can give me a BS answer and say that I need to use their provided router/modem combo?",

There are also several Vyve speedtest servers available on speedtest.net, although none I can see that are physically in this region, that should allow the speedtest to traverse within the Vyve network infrastructure.\n\nClemson University peers directly with Vyve (previously known as Northland) in order to allow local Vyve customers a more direct connection to Clemson Data Centers.\n\nNext time you notice the issue, test to several differnt Speedtest servers in the Atlanta, GA area and Charlotte, NC area, and some of the Vyve servers available, as well.\n\nAlso, test to the Clemson speedtest server at http://net-test.clemson.edu . This should tell you if the problem is local, and within the Vyve network infrastructure in this area.\n\nIn a coax infrastructure, you are sharing more of your neighbor's, up to several neighborhood's, bandwidth to the Vyve head end in your area. More so than in other service providers' infrastructure, anyway. Any high bandwidth peak times will be worse in tightly populated areas.\n\nAs for contacting Vyve, if there is a signal issue on your modem, or upstream up to the head end, Vyve should be able to test for that remotely when you call and open a ticket with them.",

However, sometimes when it chooses a server to connect to, it won't choose the Hartwell server and will choose some random one in North Carolina. I just wish they would get their shit together since they basically have a monopoly on me unless I move.",

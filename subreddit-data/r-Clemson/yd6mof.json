            "comment": "As a followup,  Clemson Edge pressures renters to renew almost immediately upon starting a lease term.  They continuously raise rent for next year until you renew or move on.  Pretty sure this is standard practice.  I'm sure driven by Real Page recommendations across the market (see original post on price setting/collusion/fixing).  However,  we have been trying to renew and have experienced issues where they (mythical they) have \"sent\" documents to sign online etc etc. where they simply haven't shown up.  We call and are rudely informed we haven't correctly completed the steps.  Even though we have,  but can't prove a negative.  Meanwhile,  the rent for next year goes up and up (now $130 above the current lease  rate beginning this August). Finally,  we sit in the office and complete the steps in person (for an even higher price) and lo and behold,  mysteriously the previously signed and completed document shows up.  At this point,  I feel like the property managers have not been dealing with us in good faith and possibly intentionally stalling/technical difficulties... (right) to force us into an even higher rate (evidently every 24 hours?).  In addition,  the price fixing/collusion combined with the high demand and low supply of available units is forcing students to accept insane increases.  I'm sure this isn't unique to Clemson Edge.  Is anyone else experiencing these ridiculous practices?",

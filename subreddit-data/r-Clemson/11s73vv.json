    "postText": "Hello Clemson gen chem students! I am offering free chemistry help for general chemistry students via YouTube. Every Wednesday at 7pm EDT (UTC \u22124:00 hours) I have an interactive live stream on general chemistry topics.\n\nThis week we are working equilibrium problems. We will discuss the conditions of equilibrium, how to write and calculate K and Q as well as equilibrium concentrations of species. We will also discuss and use Le Ch\u00e2telier\u2019s principle. You are welcome to join in and ask questions in the chat and request other chemistry topics/problems for future live streams.\n\nI was a college professor (mostly general chemistry, but a bit of organic as well) for ten years. The YouTube channel is Chem Help ASAP (link here: [https://www.youtube.com/c/ChemHelpASAP](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChemHelpASAP)) I hope I can help you understand chemistry a bit better!",

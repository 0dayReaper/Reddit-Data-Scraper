Being given an opportunity like this is very exciting as i have worked my ass off the past few years in high school and am ready for a new start. But i just had a few questions and hopefully some can be answered! \n\nCollege is obviously about learning/academics (on top of ACTUALLY living life), so i\u2019m just curious what\u2019s it like to be going to school at clemson academically? I would be majoring in engineering and i know that the first year or engineering at clemson is combined study before deciding what branch i would like to go into and that\u2019s already a plus for me! \n\nWhat\u2019re the gyms like at clemson? I am a pretty avid weightlifter and honestly most of my personal happiness comes from being in the gym outside of school and I just wanna know if i\u2019ll be able to get in some good facilities. \n\nWeekend life at Clemson? I know that football at Clemson is HUGE and that\u2019s extremely exciting!! But what I am really afraid of is being bored in college when i\u2019m not looking to be tailgating/partying some weekends which is why i\u2019ve looked into other schools that are more city based as well just because I really wanna get out and know the world and get some individual freedom in college. \n\nHow is Clemson\u2019s studying abroad program? \n\nClemson is ranked #11 for happiest students and #5 for students love their college and i just want some insider info if that\u2019s actually true! \n\nThanks guys!! Go Tigers!!",

            "comment": "i came from oos (like northeast) so it was a big change culture wise but i loved it. \n\ni am also engineering and i\u2019ll say they have a great engineering program. first year is \u201cgeneral\u201d engineering so you\u2019ll take calculus, physics, chem etc. (freshman year is kind of tough but once you get through it the upper level professors are AMAZING and do a great job connecting with their students). these will all be big classes because so many people have to take them. i was in RISE which is residents in science in engineering so i lived in lever with only stem students and took classes with stem students which i really enjoyed because it was a great way to meet similar minded people. they also offer free tutoring and events which was great freshman year. \n\ni am actually not a sports person so i don\u2019t even go to most events but i still have a large social circle that go out on hikes or weekend trips or house parties. there\u2019s tons of clubs and communities that are super inviting and keep you occupied. there is always events on campus (some even free) that are cool to go to. for example they had hispanic cultural night where they had food trucks and played coco outside in the gardens. or a clemson engineers for developing countries presentation where they had students present but also free food from their countries where the project was located. \n\nclemson is definitely small but greenville is 45 minutes away and is full of restaurants and theaters and festivals etc. it\u2019s actually one of the top rated places to go in the US food wise. we\u2019re also 2 hours from both chatlotte, atlanta, and columbia so you can easily do day/weekends trips for concerts or events etc. i just went to atlanta for the weekend for a convention. \n\ni have ALSO studied abroad over the summer and 100% best experience i\u2019ve ever had. it was a 5 week faculty directed program in pamplona spain. you\u2019re with a group of students and clemson professors so you don\u2019t feel alone at all. they also have traditional exchange full semester programs which i\u2019ve heard good things about (it\u2019s just sometimes difficult especially with engineering to get class credits, so summer programs are really good in that sense) \n\nhope this helped are hope you decide to come to clemson! go tigers \ud83d\udc05",

            "comment": "I enjoyed my experience as an engineering student when I attended Clemson. General Engineering gave me a chance to look into my options and decide whether mechanical engineering was the direction I wanted to take. I also had the opportunity to participate in the CO-OP program as a student which benefited me a lot. Depending on the type of engineering you want to do, there are plenty of study abroad programs which is highly encouraged. There are also programs that allow you to spend some semesters at CU-ICAR or the research facility in Charleston if you want to stay within the state. You won\u2019t be short of opportunities and your academic experience will be whatever you make of it. \n\nThere are also plenty of activities to do during the weekends. Downtown Greenville is about 35 minutes from campus and it is one of the best cities within the state if you\u2019re looking for a city experience. There are several activities going on over there each week. Also, Clemson is home to the Blue Ridge Mountains, waterfalls, and beautiful lakes (Jocasee, Keowee, and Hartwell). Often students go out to hike, swim, boat, fish, water ski, kayak, whitewater rafting, etc. Lastly, there are several clubs on campus that you can participate in if you have a hobby or interest.",

            "comment": "current engineering student here (in my third year)! so far, i\u2019ve enjoyed my time at clemson!\n\nacademically, it requires a good bit of time and effort to understand/be successful in your classes. as someone who always found school easy, it has taken significantly more time and effort (in my experience) to understand material, and i\u2019m still figuring out how to study. i\u2019ve enjoyed my engineering classes though (despite the higher level of difficulty) and continue to enjoy more of my classes as i start really getting involved in my major. there are a LOT of resources available to you as a first year student that help with many early courses in the engineering curriculum, which is certainly helpful. \n\nin general, i like clemson, the campus and the town, but it\u2019s really in the middle of nowhere. i didn\u2019t have a car my freshman year, and it was the first full covid year, so there wasn\u2019t a whole lot to occupy my time. of course, if you have a car, the drive to Greenville isn\u2019t bad. it is like 45 minutes and a fun place to go, just not immediately nearby. \n\nmy biggest frustration with clemson, though, is the parking and the construction. i understand that clemson is a growing school, and it\u2019s great that the campus can grow, too. it just feels like there\u2019s construction all over campus, which really takes away from the beauty and environment of campus and is also inconvenient in places. library bridge is the main connection between two sides of campus, and it has been closed as a connection for (i believe) a year and a half now. it isn\u2019t a huge deal, and there are ways to avoid it, but it\u2019s definitely a disappointment. and parking really is atrocious. it is a massive problem and nothing seems to be happening to approach the problem. when i say it\u2019s a problem\u2014i got to campus at around 9:30 the other day and there were literally no commuter spots. i mean everything was full. there is transit, and generally i don\u2019t mind the CATbus, but it really ate into my schedule as my classes ran into the evening, and the bus runs less often. \n\nmy time here has only improved since the start, so i think it will be a better place to be since you\u2019re (hopefully) not gonna start in the middle of a pandemic. \n\ncongrats on the acceptance, and good luck with making your decisions!",

As far as weightlifting, fike is over capacity so unless you\u2019re going at 6am, it might be better to get an off-campus membership (max fitness is good for $30 a month and not too far) also soccer games are very fun and not as crowded, they have good food at baseball games, and There plenty of intramurals which were always fun to do when I was there.",

            "comment": "every experience is different!! i\u2019m a current senior in undergrad, and after almost 4 years here, I\u2019ve personally been a bit disappointed at how a lot of things are handled education-wise. a large portion of my professors over my years here have just been grad students. other professors have been rude, condescending, or impossible to understand; I literally just had one threaten to drop our grades behind our backs if we challenge him at all /: but there are definitely some very great professors too!!! honestly, though, I had a better experience with professors at the nearby tech school, TriCounty, who were all very caring and passionate about their subjects. but again, that\u2019s just my experience\u2014I was on a computer science/psychology path so I\u2019m not sure how it would differ for engineering!!\n\ni\u2019m honestly sad to say that I wound up transferring out of my first major, computer science,(my minor is CS related though!!) due to the fast-paced nature of the classes and professors who either had a giant language barrier or weren\u2019t very helpful on an individual level. last semester alone I met at least 5 other people who transferred out of CS and one who transferred out engineering.\n\nbut again, this is just my experience\u2014 I have many friends who are successful in the CS/engineering majors due to their personal intelligence/drive!!! the school does also have a lot of direct paths to opportunities, like internships, co ops, career fairs and career counselors. wishing you the best of luck on your college hunt, please lmk if i can answer any more questions!!!

            "comment": "As a graduating senior, I can no longer recommend this college for engineering after witnessing the past two years. The gyms here are lackluster at best and a disaster at worst. Our main gym is feeling the effects of our increased student population and I often have to cut off half of my program because the machines are so busy. It can be extremely hard to maneuver with all the people at peak hours. This forces students with complete programs to wait until weird hours like 10pm or 9am to go to the gym and it can still be crowded even then. Our secondary gym is meant for mostly cardio and doesn\u2019t have a ton of value. I often have to drive 20 minutes to find a gym not full of college students.\n\nClemson is in the middle of nowhere. Aside from partying (which you wont get to do much of unless you choose civil engineering), there is very little to do within a 30 minute drive. You are mostly forced to drive to Greenville for that. The football scene is alright but drops off significantly if you don\u2019t live near campus due to parking on gamedays. \n\nParking is a nightmare and I\u2019ve seen how bad it is at other campuses. Our infastructure is not geared to handle the size of our current student body and choosing Clemson means you get to deal with 4 years of ever-increasing students. Last semester the student body pleaded for admin to do something about the parking as all parking lots were full by 11:00am and students were driving around for hours looking for parking. Admin sent out a condescending email and then proceeded to tell us to park in lots that are reliant on a bus to get to campus from. They doubled down this semester by closing one of the largest lots on campus and sent us a nearly identical email. Clemson used to be much higher on the \u201cstudents love their colleges\u201d ranking and is starting to slip for these reasons as more students wake up. \n\nClemson does, however, do a pretty bang-up job with their career services. Co-ops and internships are great and I never hear any complaints. \n\nI\u2019d look around first and maybe keep Clemson as a safety school.",

                    "comment": "I get some of these frustrations but are they really unique to clemson? \n\nIs there a big public school that doesn't have parking issues?\n\nAnd isn't the goal of college to have a good job getting out of it?\n\nAnd a ton of the off campus housing spots usually have a gym on site. \n\nIdk as an off campus student I truly get the parking issue, I'm coming from a 30 min drive for an 8am class. So I've gotta get up even earlier since the park and ride bus comes every 10 min and they drop off about a half mile from the business building. \n\nBut I don't think it's a clemson issue (although I would say we can do better with it).",

If we paid the discount price or got a partial refund then it wouldnt be an issue. Other schools have parking decks. \n\n2. Clemson does a good job with co-ops and internships.  ?\n\n3. Off campus gyms are horrendously under-equipped. Few of them have more than one bench (if any) and you are lucky to find actual plates and free weights. They\u2019re fine if you just want to run on the treadmill.",

Which said another way: if you are strong in the topic you will find it easy.\n\nI didn't take the Clemson Placement Test but did take the Compass test back in 2020. I burned through the practice problems in an online algebra text book before taking the test only reviewing what I got wrong (looking at you: completing the square). I hadn't been in school for a decade at that point and placed into 1060. Too me it wasn't that difficult but that's unique to my experience. Your mileage may vary. \n\nI remember the math, reading, and writing components together took me about an and a half.",

            "comment": "It uses ALEKS and it\u2019s 25-30 questions. You need to get an 80 on it to place into MATH 1060 as I\u2019m sure you are aware. If you need to take this test that tells me that you didn\u2019t submit test scores, or didn\u2019t get AP credit. The exam is not super hard but you need to make sure you are extremely confident in your pre-calc before you take it. I believe you get 5 attempts and it gets harder every time you re-take. The exam is an algorithm that figures out what you are weak at after taking the test. It will then keep asking you questions on those topics and will add stuff you may or may not have seen before. Good Luck",

It may just help having to worry about less classes.\n\nI'm not sure when registration is/was but for summer gen ed classes like that that you can take anywhere, it's typically cheaper/easier to take those at a technical/community college and transfer the credit.  I took Chem 2 and the Calc 1060 equivalent at York Tech and found the professors to be actually better for me than the ones I had at Clemson for those early gen eds.  (aka I didn't get stuck with somebody with no education experience who taught math with words instead of formulas).",

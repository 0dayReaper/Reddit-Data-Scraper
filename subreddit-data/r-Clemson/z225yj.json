    "postText": "I'm getting a scooter this Friday that I plan to bring back from home. It's just a normal ass scooter, no electric anything. I know relatively about all of the new things about e-scooters, mopeds, etc, but I have no idea how to find any rules about normal scooters. Should I just treat it with bike rules?\n\nI will note that I plan on using the bike racks and bought a lock for it. The only time I'd take it inside is when I go into my house (Thornhill resident).",

You might struggle bringing it around campus there aren\u2019t a ton of flat areas so you\u2019re either gonna be trying to slow down on a hill or pushing your scooter up one. But if you have a route planned here you can take advantage of it go for it.",

Most of them stay on the roads with car, stop at signs, etc. like bikes. Theres just way too many pedestrians to be on the sidewalk unless its one of the bigger areas. Be sure look where you go!! There's been cases of injury due to collisions between scooters and ppl.",

My only advice is to make sure you\u2019re comfortable stopping or swerving on whatever you use. I can\u2019t count the amount of times I was cruising down the hill on Williamson road in front of the stadium and a car pulled out in front of me coming off of fort hill street. Other than that just be considerate and let people know when you\u2019re approaching them from behind. Don\u2019t wanna be that person that blasts by a walker and scare the shit out of them or run into them.",

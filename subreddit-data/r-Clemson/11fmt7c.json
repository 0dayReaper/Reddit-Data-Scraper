    "postText": "hi! i am interested in majoring in physics w/ an emphasis in astronomy and i have a few questions if anyone who was/is in the major! it is a bit hard to find any information outside the official website bc its such a small major.\n\n1. what are the facilities like? are the labs modern/updated? do you think that the physics building is run-down? \n\n2. what are the professors/classes like? are they approachable and welcoming? are the classes small, and would you describe students as collaborative? \n\n3. how many students in the department participate in research? is it easy to get involved? \n\n4. what\u2019s something you love about the department, and what\u2019s something you would change?\n\ni appreciate all answers :) go tigers!",

Most of the money for the department goes to research and not fancy facilities, but it's good enough. Definitely not the most run down on campus. There's a student lounge for undergrads and that's really the best part of the building. Labs aren't super modern or updated but they don't need to be and there's still some amazing research being done here\n2. The professors are my favorite part of the entire university. Some are not the best (dm me if you want specifics) but for the most part it feels like a huge family and they're super helpful and understanding in my experience. Classes aren't huge usually around 20 I think, but they get smaller as you get into higher levels\n3. Pretty much every student gets involved in research by their sophomore year at least I think. It's pretty easy to get involved especially since Clemson has a Creative Inquiry program that's really helpful\n4. The department is super close knit so it's like a big family which is a plus and a minus. If there's some drama, everyone knows. It's a sort of a small-town fit. There's also the Society of Physics Students (I was an officer for a bit in this so feel free to ask me more questions about it as well)\n\nOverall I've loved th department and most parts of it. If you have any other questions or just wanna talk to a current student feel free to DM!",

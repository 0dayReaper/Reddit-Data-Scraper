                    "comment": "While you aren't wrong that the goal is to be in the AAU, it has nothing to do with trying to get a bid to the B1G. It's been the university's goal since well before the current round of college football realigment and is largely independent of athletic affiliation. Becoming a member of the AAU would be far more valuable for the university than extra money from a TV contact for sports.\n\nAlso the university is only barely an R1...actually getting into the AAU is a huge stretch goal. The GoR will have expired and we'll have joined another conference well before we achieve AAU status, in my opinion.",

We achieved that a few years back and this is simply another stretch target for is to work towards academically.  Barker and now Clements have been very open about the strategic direction of the school for two decades and it has helped unify efforts for improvement.  (Example: opening our Veterinary school is a long term commitment to changing curriculum that falls in line with this vision.)\n\nAthletics has been proven to increase applicant rates allowing the university to continue to raise the bar for academic standards without dropping enrollment numbers (base revenue).  Securing more funding for athletics also allows for some of the largest money donors to divert money away from things new practice facilities and parking infrastructure while maintaining national relevance in money sports like football.  Simply showing progress towards AAU certification will be enough to convince B1G university presidents we are committed to \"playing school\" as well as \"playing ball\" and makes us more of a cultural fit.  The university presidents are the ones we need to convince to move conferences, not any sports figureheads.",

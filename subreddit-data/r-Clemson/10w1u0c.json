    "postText": "I've been accepted to a Masters program in Clemson (Computer Science) . Since I'm an International student one way for me to judge a university is the rankings(I know rankings can be misleading, but still they account for something right ?)\n\nI'm a bit worried about Clemson's rankings in the recent years. For example, QS rankings have dropped significantly ( #601 in 2012 to #800-1000 in 2022). THE ( #350-400 in 2012 to #800-1000 in 2022).\n\nDoes this mean the quality of the school has gone down over the years ? How is the overall reputation of this school in U.S ?",

We've certainly got a fuck ton more resources over the past decade due to increased donations and an expansion of the university as a whole/out of state kids.",

For graduate level study I'd imagine your advisors, alumni networks, and specific field of study are going to be the determining factors in where you go over anything else.   \n\n\nClemson graduates compete very well against Georgia Tech (QS rank 88), UF (QS rank 173), and Virginia Tech (QS rank 346) grads at the company I co-op at (co-op students AND full time employees). These are primarily Mechanical, Electrical, and Industrial engineers, but the logic applies to CompSci to some degree I'd imagine.",

            "comment": "I am a Computer engineering BS graduate 2022 from Clemson and current PhD student in Computer Science (at a different college). I felt that Clemson offers a great education and the class quality is comparable to most schools. \n\nWhere I felt that Clemson lacked is funding, connections, and research in the area I wanted. This is extremely important if you plan on doing a masters with a thesis. Look at the research in your area of interest and see the papers. csrankings.org is a great resource for this. This shows staff publications within your area of interest.  \n\nIf your just doing a masters of engineering (no thesis), Clemson is a great option. Again, just make sure the classes offered fall inline with your interests. You are sought after by employers in the region (like others mentioned).\n\nRankings are important. However, they aren\u2019t everything. It depends if Clemson offers quality research in your area of research. I decided to move to a different school due to the lack of hardware software integration research. Another thing to consider is location. I didn\u2019t like the location of Clemson. It was extremely car dependent with minimal bike infrastructure. You can use a bike, but it\u2019s difficult compared to walkable places due to the stroads. You are biking with cars going 40-60 KPH next to you. I was luckily able to walk to get groceries; however, not everyone here in Clemson has that convenience. Just something to consider.",

            "comment": "Almost every school has stopped using their own curriculum in the vast majority of classes years ago. Clemson uses the same Mcgraw Hill, Pearson, and Cengage shit that even the tech schools use. You aren't paying for a better education (in fact, I had better classes with more qualified professors at Greenville Tech), you are paying for the Clemson network and the prestige of attending Clemson.\n\nIf I were you, I would look at whatever Universities have the best job networks and job placings in your desired field, rather than QS rankings. Those tools were more useful in the past, when schools actually made their own curriculum.",

    "postText": "I'm a second semester freshman at clemson and I'm curious what good ways there are to meet people at clemson. I been looking into joining some clubs but I really don't know where to start. I know there is the tiger quest website but there's a million listings on there. I've been ok so far because I have some friends from highschool up here but I really need to meet new people and make more friends. Thanks y'all, go tigers!",

I joined I believe like 6 clubs and am only really active in 1 due to my schedule but it\u2019s been really constructive for being friendships and adds something extra to my resume",

They are responsible for a lot of leadership programming and student programs on campus (like UNITES! evening programs every Thursday - Saturday), and they also work directly with student organizations and the TigerQuest system (where student orgs have their profiles). Lots of ways to engage and work with others students!",

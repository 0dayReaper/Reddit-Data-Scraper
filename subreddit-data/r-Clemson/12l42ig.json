    "postText": "I drove by the construction on perimeter road today and there was a ton of pieces of concrete on the road. I thought nothing of it until I got back to my car after class and my tire was flat. When I got home I noticed three cars with donuts on their cars so clearly I wasn\u2019t the only one. Curious to see if how many other people had similar incidents",

I didn\u2019t think anything of it because the weather had been weird. I went to class the next day and came back to a completely flat tire. There was about 4 nails in my tire",

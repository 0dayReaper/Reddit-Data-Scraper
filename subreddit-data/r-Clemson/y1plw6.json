At least they were when I was there. \n\nHad a buddy go as cheap as he could and his roommate regularly had roaches crawling out from under his room. Nothing he could do to get it fixed.",

I normally had to pay for meter parking just to bring my groceries in then drive to the park and ride lot and walk/take the bus. The walls are paper thin. I heard everything going on in the rooms around me at all hours and it gets annoying. There\u2019s not a dish washer which got annoying during busy parts of the semester. \n\nThere are some pros like being able to wake up late and still get to class and living near downtown was fun. But overall it wasn\u2019t worth it.",

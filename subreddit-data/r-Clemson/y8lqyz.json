Made-up a ton of new rules because they were short-term, young tenants.\n\nKnew a few other groups where it worked great and they lived there 2-3 years.  At least with a complex there's a bit of consistency and ways to get references.",

You should avoid houses that were clearly renovated into multiples units or to add extra bedrooms.  Probably a flipper with multiple properties not willing to accommodate.",

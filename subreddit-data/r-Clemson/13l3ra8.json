    "postText": "Hi all. I live at The Cottages of Clemson on the back row and tend to the colony cats that live there. Sunday morning, my favorite colony cat and one that was scheduled to go the vet before he comes inside permanently went missing. He is an orange unneutered male domestic long hair, and while shy, is very sweet to pet. I am offering a cash reward for information on if he has been seen or to have him returned. I am worried sick and just want him to be safe. Contact me on this account with information, I can provide my contact information directly through DM.",

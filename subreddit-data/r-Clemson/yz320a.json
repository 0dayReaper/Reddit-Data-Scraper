    "postText": "I'm entering a Co-op out of state and my roommate is graduating this semester so our fully furnished apartment is available for sublease. The apartment is located in Daniel Square just behind Douthit, so it's a great location and a convenient walk to campus and downtown! \n\nThe apartment is an upstairs unit with 2 bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms. Rent is only $1500 plus utilities.\n\nPM me for more details/pictures. If you google 'Daniel Square Foothills' you can see photos from a property manager. Available January 1.\n\nThanks!",

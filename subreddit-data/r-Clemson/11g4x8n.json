            "comment": "I actually went to clemson and then transferred to app state. I think a lot of it comes down to the culture. The two schools have wildly different cultures, frankly. As a grad student, it might not impact you as much, but I\u2019d also consider tuition rates. Clemson however does have a more widely known name, and it may have better alumni connections for getting a job after graduation. I did not enjoy my time at clemson and the town is very small even relative to Boone, with a very large party/bar scene. I strongly prefer the culture at app state, however the actual town itself may give you less issues. App state is currently experiencing a housing crisis and can make it difficult to find somewhere to live and you won\u2019t experience this at clemson. I think personally it would come down to reputation and cost for me, so I can\u2019t decide for you. If you have any specific questions about the two schools I\u2019d be happy to answer them as unbiased as possible",

                            "comment": "So yeah, it's a bigger bar scene overall, but I still think it depends on who you are as a person. For instance, there's a bar at app called lily's which is where there is a lot of LGBT stuff, alt people, gays, etc. you will not find that at Clemson. The bars at Clemson tend to be more \"party\" oriented if that makes sense, while app's bars are more chill + hangout oriented. I think in terms of meeting people, there are a wider variety of people at app, while Clemson is a little less diverse. Meeting people at bars in Clemson is going to be more \"frat guys approaching you\" while it's somewhat different at app. There is a bar at Clemson called Nick's which is where I've heard a lot of grad students hang out at, so it might not be that bad. Clemson also has more people in general, and more clubs. There are more bars at Clemson in general, I think about 7 vs app state's 4. Clemson is definitely more well known so I understand that point.",

    "postText": "Hello Clemson gen chem students! I am offering free chemistry help for general chemistry students via YouTube. Every Wednesday at 7pm EDT (UTC \u22124:00 hours) I have an interactive live stream on general chemistry topics.\n\nThis week we are working equilibrium problems from AP chemistry exam questions. This includes acids and bases, using Ksp, using Le Ch\u00e2telier\u2019s principle and Keq. However, all students are welcome to join- these are topics that are covered in other chemistry classes as well. Feel free to ask questions in the chat and request other chemistry topics/problems for future live streams.\n\nI was a college professor (mostly general chemistry, but a bit of organic as well) for ten years. The YouTube channel is Chem Help ASAP (link here: [https://www.youtube.com/c/ChemHelpASAP](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChemHelpASAP)) I hope I can help you understand chemistry a bit better!",

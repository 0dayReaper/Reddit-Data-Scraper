You're better off getting a single owner car with 250k+ miles on it than a 7 owner car with 125k on it. \n\nIf its a car just to get you through college i'd bump it up to 10k and get a civic,corolla etc. from a legit dealer. Even with a meh credit score you're looking at $300 a month.\n\nUnder 5k and you're really taking a risk if it's gonna run or not. \n\nThe dealers who are selling cars under and around 5k are usually shady and buy them at auction, fix them up good enough to run around the lot without exploding and clean it to make it look nice. \n\nUnless you've got mechanical experience. if you know what you're doing there's tons of hidden gems around the area that need some work on craigslist.",

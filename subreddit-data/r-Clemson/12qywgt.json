On the website for the Computer Science dept they say either Mac or PC will work.  Just wondering if current CS majors have any more insight before we need to invest in a machine soon that hopefully will last for four years.  Planning on buying direct from Clemson.",

For a lot of classes I ended up SSHing into the School of Computing servers to program (using command line or VS Code). Since that is where the professors and TA\u2019s will be grading your work, you might as well make sure it works there from the start.\nThat process would be functionally the same on either Mac or PC.\n\nProgramming locally on your computer is in general easier on a Mac then a PC so I would recommend doing a little research into what languages/projects you are interested in and whether they are smoother on Mac/PC. Once you know the tricks for PC local programming it\u2019s not too bad, and you have the added benefit of nearly every piece of downloadable software working out of the box (gaming, work, art, etc).\n\nI actually worked in the department that processes repairs for Clemson Student Mac/PC laptops and in my experience the process for PC repair was almost always simpler and quicker. If money is no object, then buying from Clemson is a pretty good deal (4 year full warranty, except battery which has 1yr warranty) and your even get a spare laptop while yours is being repaired. If you are trying to cut costs and the Clemson Laptops seem expensive (which they are) it probably is not worth it if you usually take good care of your electronics.",

The Clemson CS program was (I believe still is) taught using Linux/Unix first, so it was helpful to match environments. The lab computers are using a flavor of Linux for example.\n\nI'd personally recommend this route as it is cheaper and Linux is superior when it comes to programming, but still having the option to use Windows programs for other classes (Word, Powerpoint). If you just want to use Windows, they have an awesome coding environment (IDE) called VS Code that I use daily.\n\nI hope this is helpful and that my advice isn't too outdated.",

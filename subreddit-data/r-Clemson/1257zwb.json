    "postText": "My current roommate and I are looking for someone to rent out the master bedroom in our apartment! We will both be seniors next year and need someone else to come and move in. We both like playing video games and watching sports and usually keep to ourselves throughout the day. The lease runs from June 1st, 2023 to May 31st, 2024. The rent cost is 725 a month with added-on utilities split three ways, which would come out to around 800-825 total a month. The master bedroom comes fully furnished and has its own bathroom with a jet tub/shower. If you would be interested or have any other questions, please shoot me a message so we can discuss further!",

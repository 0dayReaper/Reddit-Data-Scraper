    "postText": "Hello everyone. I have received a provisional offer for Msc in Automotive Engineering at Greenville for the coming fall. The course deadline is 15th April, which means i have to accept or reject the offer on or before the deadline. I\u2019m still waiting on certain other applications(of other colleges) which will come in most probably after April 15th. So can i accept this offer for now and later withdraw if I get into another Uni? \n\nSeeking help on this. \nThanks in advance",

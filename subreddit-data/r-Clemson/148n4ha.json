I tried two years ago and gave up on my fifth interview but I still qualify to get that aid  but would it be worth it to take even like a $7.50 job for work study or would it make more sense to try like for a UPIC or other on campus job? Like idk some kind of advice if anyone's done a work study before?",

I\u2019m an engineering major, so I don\u2019t necessarily have a lot of free time outside of my mandatory school work. So, are work study\u2019s worth it to save a little on tuition or am I better off just not worrying about it? If anyone has any insight, I\u2019d appreciate it",

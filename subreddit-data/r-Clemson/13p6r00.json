However, when I moved in, the convocation and \u201cget to know your dorm/hall\u201d stuff was not optional as far as I know.\n\nTotally agree with the above commenter. Doing the summer orientation (even on zoom) was very helpful as an incoming freshman. Don\u2019t skip it unless you have to.",

Registration will occur in either June or July. \n\nReady, Set, Roar! is the optional in-person experience that is part of orientation. The two day event is not mandatory but highly recommended by the office.",

It was a nice way to get to know a few people, some of whom I still talk to when I see them on campus. But no the summer orientation thing is not mandatory.",

Mine lived in a different state and while we had talked a lot, we hadn\u2019t seen each other in person. \n\nYou\u2019ll meet a lot of people within your school of study so it\u2019s a bit helpful in starting to make friends.",

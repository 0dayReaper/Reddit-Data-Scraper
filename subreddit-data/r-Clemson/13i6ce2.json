Edit: actually no.\n\nYou recieve limited Google drive space (can't remember the amount)\n\nYou have access to the career center (which is an awesome resource) for one more year. \n\nCan't think of anything else you have/lose besides those.\n\nEdit: I'm a bit upset that the email isn't staying. I've been pretty happy with it and setting up a new one is a pain after going through so much with the current one.",

            "comment": "Once we get through the start of the summer semester, we will start sending communications, but as others have mentioned, we recently changed our email policy. **Alumni will only keep their Google accounts for one year after graduation.**\n\nAny recent graduates and alumni should start planning to migrate all their data, email, and logins to a personal account. You can export all your Google data using Google Takeout (https://takeout.google.com/). You will also want to make sure any accounts for websites, social media, etc. are updated to use a separate email address for your login so you can recover them if needed.\n\nAs for other resources, someone already mentioned our news article that addresses this question (https://ccit.clemson.edu/news/do-i-keep-my-email-and-other-tech-questions-from-graduating-tigers/). Generally speaking, students will retain access to many resources for one year after separating from the university. The one exception that comes to mind is Adobe Creative Cloud due to its popularity and limited number of licenses. You will lose access to CC as soon as you are marked inactive (not taking classes for the current semester).\n\nI plan to do an ama when we start the marketing campaign for our Google changes, but if you have any other questions related to OP's post, ask away.",

Forwarding from @clemson.edu to @g.clemson.edu supposedly ends soon after graduation now. \n\nYou keep Office unofficially for about a year, but I\u2019d start moving stuff in onedrive sooner than that. \n\nAdobe access will end soon, if they haven\u2019t cut it off already so offload your stuff there if you have it. Ccit can give an extension if you need more time to move stuff out of there \n\niroar access also ends somewhat soon after graduation I believe. Maybe within a few months, so save a copy of your unofficial transcript",

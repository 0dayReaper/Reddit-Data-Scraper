That train runs from Atlanta to Greenville. You would then need to travel from Greenville to Clemson.",

Yes you can take a train, but it leaves you in the middle of the night. It\u2019s not a good option when you\u2019ve been traveling. Some of the international groups might come pick you up though.",

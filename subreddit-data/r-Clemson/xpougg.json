            "comment": "THEY HAVE SUCH WEIRD RULES ABOUT SIGNS. Like if you do a gatorade sign but coke is the sponsor it wont be allowed. You use any kind of cus word or slur not allowed. Be very careful about using brands in general probably not allowed. Such weird rules with sponsors. Some people will get through with crazy signs so its not everyone it depends on the guy working that hour honestly. \n\nhaven\u2019t been to one at clemson in 6 years and the one i went to in charlotte did not allow linning up before 6am. We got there at 7am and had a great time we werent the front but we were inside the barricade. The will post rules closer im sure last time they did not allow lining up till midnight i remember but to he honest I dont remember it was 6 years ago, just know they have some weird rules i guess.\n\nBring a sign, its gonna be crazy with the rain definitely bring warm clothes. Bring food and snacks. Once it gets to actually being inside the baracade nothing is allowed that could be used as a weapon. Im talking no water bottles, especially medal ones, a-lot of people were mad about that. Literally anything you could throw at kirk or lee and hurt them wasn\u2019t allowed kinda odd.",

            "comment": "So my memory is a little spotty. But I went for the Louisville game in 2016 and dressed up like Bobby Petrino it\u2019s in my post history somewhere. They had bowman fully caution-taped off and we lined up around like 4am or something? There was supposed to be one official entrance to funnel people through. And I think around like 630 or 7 when they actually went to let people in, the caution tape broke and there was a mad rush to get towards the pit. Which is the inner area directly behind the people that gets filmed. \n\nAnyways my sign got wet from the dew and trampled. So prepare your sign to be a little rain resistant this weekend for sure. Line up as early as you can and get a good spot. If you don\u2019t get a good spot though it would be best to have a taller sign. I think the rules about signs only apply if you\u2019re in the pit. If you\u2019re outside the boundaries of the pit you don\u2019t have to follow the rules but you\u2019re less likely to get on camera. Might be wrong about a couple things but just adding my 2 cents",

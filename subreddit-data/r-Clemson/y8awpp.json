    "postText": "I have been trying to schedule a tour or find out any information regarding fees about the hideaway lofts at the district at Clemson but every time I call they always say they will have someone call me back\u2026. And never get a call back. I\u2019m afraid if I keep waiting they will already be sold out for next year. Does anyone know anything about these apartments? \n\nI really just want a pet friendly one bedroom for next fall as I will be graduating in Dec but am having trouble finding something. So if you know of anything else similar that\u2019s not ridiculously priced (preferably under $900-1000 with utilities included) lmk! Thanks!",

They use a call center that doesn't communicate at all with their actual staff, which is just two people. The call center scheduled a tour for us and didn't even communicate it to the staff. It's some management change/cost cutting thing I think.\n\nI don't know much about 1 bedrooms but I know they wanted $850 a bed unfurnished and no utilities included for the 3 bed, so they'll be pushing if not exceeding your budget. 1 beds are hard to find, and basically every student housing crap around here is horribly overpriced. For the total rent collected for a 3 bed place you could rent a 3500sqft house where I'm from and have money left over. Its crimenally overpriced around here because there are no options, the student housing complexes collude prices, and they never build enough forcing high demand and high prices. Good luck.",

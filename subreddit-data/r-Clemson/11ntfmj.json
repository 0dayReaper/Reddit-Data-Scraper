You\u2019ll be more than prepared. \n\nSure you\u2019ll have to learn the ins and outs of the technology stack and how they have all their own shit setup at your first job, but that\u2019s everyone even kids who graduate from MIT or Stanford. \n\nYou\u2019ll easily be able to find a job if your motivated, and you won\u2019t be hurting for a nice salary either.",

If you want to work in software just do CpSc, the hardware and electrical engineering classes aren't going to come into play in the majority of software jobs.  \n\n\nIf you want a software job, the best piece of advice I can give to you is to become a TA for a data structures and algorithms class.  Getting an A is probably good enough too, but being a TA will force you to look at the same algorithms from every angle and debug them with all the shit your students come up with.  And you'll practice them enough that you won't forget them and have to relearn them once you actually apply for jobs.  \n\n\nThe majority of questions in any entry level technical interview will come from data structures and algorithms.  Other high level classes are for fun or to expose you to different possibilities, but data structures and algorithms will get you the job full stop.  \nGood luck",

The only thing a degree does for you in our field is help get you an interview which this will do easily. You\u2019ll always have a technical interview which is where they will decide if your hire-able. Cpe certainly teaches you how to code so you are able to learn other languages that jobs actually want(nobody using c in the software world) that said if you want to do software computer science more likely to teach a language you\u2019d actually use with a shitload less math. \n\nTl:dr it\u2019s fine just learn what you need for the job you want you likely have to regardless of the degree.",

If your internship is affiliated with the university, and they won't spring for a paid parking permit, they can request a free summer program parking pass for you. It's limited and kind of crappy locations, but at least it's on campus, sort of.\n\nWhichever department you are working in can make a request through the Summer Camps Parking Request form here: [https://clemson.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_bxsS9unH2wtvRcN](https://clemson.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bxsS9unH2wtvRcN)The field they want to use on that form is \" Number of Campus PERIMETER Parking Permits Request(Reminder: these permits are free and DO NOT allow for parking on the campus interior)\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck",

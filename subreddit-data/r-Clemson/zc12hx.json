    "postText": "Not a Clemson alum nor a Clemson fan, but I think this needs to be said due to all the DJ hate. Look, he's not D1 Clemson caliber - we all know that. But the problem with Clemson this year is Dabo. DJ is who DJ has been: spotty QB play with highlight athletic plays. But that's not what makes a solid QB. Consistency is key. DJ is the epitome of inconsistency. And it's annoying that we have to be either be mad at or sick of DJ. DJ should long have been replaced and he has, due to poor decision making, been the ire of the fans discontent. Dabo owes a huge apology to both the DEFENSE (all caps because they've been carrying y'all and showing up almost every game) and to you, the fans.  Don't let Dabo off. Don't let his \"loyalty\" issues prevent you from the being the fantastic team that you are. He has great ideals. But being great goes hand-in-hand with seeing ones own weakness. Unabashed loyalty is only cute when it succeeds. Would Saban or Kelly have been done the same? No. Why did he switch out Kelly Bryant for Lawrence and not do the same now? Idk. I'm done now. Just... I like this team from what I've seen.  I like Dabo. But don't stop making him be great. Don't stop making him be accountable to you, the fans.",

And tonight they said multiple times DJ was one of the first ones to congratulate Cade when he got back to the sideline after a successful drive and was giving him tips and advice all night.",

You don't throw your backup QB in late into the game with no snaps in a situation where you're backed up into the end zone and  expect them to deliver you from the devil. I was watching and got legitimately upset by that decision. Who does that? That shows that he has never been certain of his choice and was throwing hope-to-hope that Cade could save them. This is poor coaching. If you have that much doubt as a head coach, that means there's something wrong. Also, that pick wasn't even bad. If you watch the replay, the WR even taps his chest and talks to Cade about he didn't fight for that ball. It wasn't a poor throw at all. A great throw? Obviously, not. It was catchable, but the WR didn't fight for it at all.\n\nAnd against SC. He had less than 100 yards. In the air. As a QB. He had a 27% completion percentage. No amount of poor defense excuses that. Yeah, he didn't contribute to the other teams being bad, but... I mean it was a 1 point loss. 8/29 isn't good enough to lose. That's just losing. I know my post was more pro-DJ not being the evil here, but a spade is a spade.",

I think we\u2019re gonna have to have Shipley go full McCaffrey with his all purpose yards to beat them. We did with Sammy Watkins and OSU in 2013, we can do it again with Ship.  \n  \nIf we have as good a result against them like we did against OSU back then, we should be fine. I think UT may struggle on offense without Hooker and their OC.  \n  \nAlso, I want no more Wes Goodwin slander. He neutralized all three of the best QBs in the ACC when needed. The only one that shredded us was Hartman. We faced a healthy Leary and a solid Maye, and we exposed Maye completely. This game call was just like Bama in 2018 and Ohio State in 2019.

It was clear that DJ is good kid and doing his best. So much pressure on him when he just wasn't up to it. And we had a servicable backup on the bench (Hunter) if Cade wasn't ready, but it appears now that the staff didn't even try to prepare Cade after it was crystal clear DJ was struggling. Everyone is pissed at Dabo and staff, NOT DJ. They blew the winning streak at home to USC, of all teams and it makes NO sense. No sense whatsoever. They squandered the talents of an otherwise championship caliber team.",

Not even his biggest critics seem to argue that.   \n\n\nHe just maybe isn't very good. It's not like he got paid and then didn't try hard enough. Everything I've read suggested he tried his hardest.",

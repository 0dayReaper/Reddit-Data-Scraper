            "comment": "I had an interview in person for my PhD program. From what I understand is that if it is in person you are very very very likely to be accepted but they use that time as an opportunity to make sure you are legit. What I did if have a list of professors I would like to work with and get to know about their specific research. This leads you to be more open to change in the chance that professor is not what you expected and another has a better offer. This happened to be where I chose a professor who offered more opportunities and had more connections to get me into the door. I would definitely look into their recent studies and try to understand the basics (read some papers, this is challenging at first but showing effort will certainly help). If you submitted an essay and talked about a topic make sure you are read to go more in-depth about that topic. In my one on one interview they asked how the thing I talked about worked specifically, not just what it did. Last word of advice is to just be genuine and show interest in what you value. Hope this helps somewhat",

If you don't have alot of research experience but you can talk in detail about what you have done you are sitting in a good a spot. Have questions about the department we have a genetics center, and EPIC that are good talking points. Have a reason for pursuing your degree, it doesn't have to be deep or sentimental just be confident in the answer. For the first interview that will give you a good baseline.",

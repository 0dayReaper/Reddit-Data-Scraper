    "postText": "Got accepted into Computer Science at Clemson. Wondering if the BA or BS track is better to major in? Wanting to go for a career in web development. \n\nI\u2019ve also never been great at Math. I can do it, but it was never my best subject. Will this make the degree super difficult to get? Will I need advanced math after school?\n\nAny advice you can offer about computer science and/or Clemson is greatly appreciated. This will be my second time attending a University after a long hiatus and I\u2019m super nervous about going back. Especially for a major that is so far from what I originally majored in (18 year old me was a different person).",

            "comment": "Web development doesn't need advanced math. To be honest the vast majority (95% at least) of programming jobs only use algebra. However, I think I would recommend trying for a BS. I think it may be required for some jobs right out of school - until you have a little experience in the field then it won't matter. Take this with a grain of salt though cause I'm not on the hiring side of things.\n\nCalc 2 is the hardest math class you'll take with a BS in CS FYI. You'd take it your second semester most likely so if it doesn't go well you could probably pivot quite easily to a BA. Talk to an advisor though.\n\nCouple of tips for math classes:    \n\\- A good professor is key! It can make or break even the best math students so do some research when picking.    \n\\- Try to find one or two people in the class you can study with. It helps a lot to first study the material by yourself then meetup with them to go over problems you don't understand/teach them things they don't understand.    \n\\- A huge part of passing math classes is just doing tons of practice problems until you understand the pattern.",

Somewhat due to the reasons you listed but also because I minored in a foreign language and it was easier that way. \n\nI\u2019ve had no issues with my degree career wise. I don\u2019t think most employers even realize or care about the nuances between the programs. \n\nNo interviewer has ever asked me about it, but if they did I would just explain that I wanted to minor in a foreign language and it was the best way to do both. \n\nIf you go the BA route I highly encourage you to pick a minor that you\u2019re interested in (I think you have to pick a minor for a BA anyways). It was a fun way for me to pursue a hobby of mine while also getting a degree that\u2019s valuable in the job market. \n\nMy graduating class had 5 CS BAs; minoring in music, political science, economics, and Chinese (me).",

It is nice to hear from someone who has done it and moved on into a career. I am glad Clemson has this option for the tech people who also are interested in humanities. It is the sweet spot for my son.",

I\u2019d say get a BS because most employers are looking for applicants who have a BS, rather than a BA. I honestly haven\u2019t even met anyone with a BA in Comp sci and I\u2019ve been here for 2 years and I\u2019m a senior in CUS\n\nChoosing the CIS major was definitely a tougher choice between the two but I definitely appreciate replacing all the tough math courses with business courses like Business Calc 1 and 2, management, business stats, marketing, etc. The one draw back is that you will also have to take ACCT 1010 and ACCT 2020, don\u2019t know what it is about them but every CIS major seems to struggle. You\u2019ll need to take micro or macro Econ, honestly micro was super easy.",

            "comment": "My 2 cents, I graduated with a BA in Comp Sci in 2018 and minored in Digital Production Arts (DPA). I have not been asked about it in interviews, and if I was I'd explain that I wanted to be well-rounded with some visual art classes as well. Not to doxx myself, but I have been working in the web dev space since I graduated.\n\nMath classes: I started out as a BS student but switched to BA because I couldn't swing it, however there is the option of taking Calc 1 and 2 at a community college such as Tri County and transferring those credits. If you do that please verify that you can as I'm not 100% on the details. In BA you would be taking Business Calc 1 and 2, and a business stats class. To me, Business Calc 1 and 2 were taught in a way that was far more digestible to me, and both times I came the closest I've ever been to making an A in a college math class.\n\nCurriculum: Things may have changed since I graduated, but the lower-level CS classes for both BA and BS were the same, i.e. the weed-out classes. Look at ratemyprofessor and try and get the best possible as that can really help. Later on for junior/senior level classes, I remember having more freedom to choose CS classes, I didn't *have* to do Operating Systems or Networking like I believe BS had to. One other thing to note is you will have to take 4 semesters worth of a foreign language with a BA. I did German which was pretty cool.\n\nDPA minor: I loved these classes as it taught/worked on creative skills that aren't touched on in a CS degree. Have I used anything from DPA in my career? Not really, besides general creative skills with web development. DPA is/was also the longest masters program at Clemson, at 3 years, but grad students I know did go off to work for big time animation companies. The program is very good and has connections.\n\nWeb development: At least during my time, the CS program was pretty lacking in teaching web development skills. The only class I took specific to web dev was a 1 off special class that wasn't offered year round. Things may have changed. The fundamentals are there and I still think it is important to have well-rounded knowledge, but a lot of what I do everyday was learned on the job or just on my own. I also don't use advanced math in my every day job.\n\nI hope this helps and I'll be happy to answer any questions you have. Personally I would say try a BS first as there are ways to make the math classes easier (community college).",

As far as being well prepared, Clemson CS gave me a good toolset and starting off point, but there's a lot they don't/can't teach that you have to learn on the job. Depends on the job too. \n\nThink about it this way, a CS degree focuses on building a foundation, learning theoreticals and gives you problem-solving skills you will rely on in the future. It's actually not too bad once you have the building blocks.",

Since you already filled out the transfer application, we can't change common app. Better to just log into your portal clemson gives you and add in those supporting documents there",

I'd suggest one from a teacher who is in your desired major (ex: science prof if you wanna transfer into clemson biochem) the other can be a prof who knows you really well. :) although you send it on your side, the prof (I bet) has to email it to clemson\u2019s transfer admissions office on their side as well. \n\nAdd in a resume in there too. Great GPA. I'm not sure if clemson does demonstrated interests, but that doesn't hurt to show tiger pride",

If you are in the same boat then you really shouldn\u2019t need it and should save it.\n\nIf you are close or just made the cut the it might be best to send in a document and kinda chat up the advisor of the program you are looking into. They may be able to help you get in and away the decision of the admissions office. I know it helped me doing that as well, my advisor was friends with the lady handling my admissions file and decision.",

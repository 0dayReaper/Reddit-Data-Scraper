    "postText": "I apologize for this long post. I\u2019m a Clemson professor, and I\u2019m not here to speak in any official capacity. I repeat\u2026nothing official and I have no idea what Clemson\u2019s plans are.  I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, and \\*maybe\\* Clemson reopens classes on March 30. For that to happen, almost all the epidemiological experts would have to be wrong and we\u2019d have to avoid what\u2019s happening everywhere else. So I just wanted to post to make sure some of you make informed decisions about the next two weeks, especially about whether you plan come back and wait this out here in Clemson or stay home with parents or friends. It\u2019s an important decision.\n\nFirst off, this is a serious situation. It\u2019s not fear mongering. It\u2019s being informed. I\u2019m not arguing with the \"this is just the flu\u201d crowd. They\u2019re wrong, irresponsible, and going to actively get people killed if they keep sharing that sentiment with others. One of the best things I saw on some of those attitudes was a tweet about 9/11. After 9/11 we were all told we can\u2019t stop living our lives or else the terrorists win (I was a freshman in college), and that was right. Terrorists win if we stop going to bars and having fun. Well guess what\u2026a virus doesn\u2019t give a f&amp;#k about your or your bar. You don\u2019t have anything to prove to a virus. You need to live your life different the next few weeks.\n\nAlso, if it\u2019s really just some flu, why has it now effectively shut down France, Spain, Israel, Italy, Iran, and China? Those countries are brought to their knees, [with France and Spain shutting down almost everything this weekend](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51892477). It\u2019s not a hoax. \\***Most of the models I\u2019ve seen say we have regions in the US that are about 2-3 weeks from where France and Spain are on the curve.\\*** This is a real situation. Even Fox News and the President are finally admitting that. You\u2019re allowed to listen.\n\nAnd if you want an idea what this is like, [read this account from Italy.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/who-gets-hospital-bed/607807/) Their doctors are now having to decide about who gets medical attention and who doesn\u2019t based on life expectancy. And that\u2019s Northern Italy. Northern Italy is one of the richer regions in the world.\n\nYou all are younger, so most of you won\u2019t die. However, [there\u2019s some confusion about the word \u201cmild.\u201d](https://www.thecut.com/2020/03/what-are-the-symptoms-of-mild-coronavirus.html?fbclid=IwAR2NQIfV_Zq-y9LdVwdJfv3Zqe245AHUQr1AsoL9DAbjth8gsSMjOQH6Imk) A mild case of coronavirus includes anything up to needing intubation and an overnight hospital stay. You can get pneumonia for three weeks and be the sickest you\u2019ve ever been in your life and still be mild. Also, as of right now, HALF the cases in [France\u2019s ICU are people under 60](https://www.wnep.com/article/news/nation-world/over-half-of-frances-300-coronavirus-icu-patients-under-age-60/523-9c26ad1f-f633-4409-aba4-1fe054733fba). If we do not practice social distancing and flatten the curve ([read this to understand what that means),](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/10/21171481/coronavirus-us-cases-quarantine-cancellation) there might be almost no hospital beds left in three weeks. That means people will die of unrelated things (accidents, heart attacks, etc.) because the hospitals will be overloaded by this virus. Please help flatten the curve.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a really key thing: some of you who are 20-29 won\u2019t get very sick (though some will). But those of you who don\u2019t get very sick are the truly terrifying ones. You\u2019re the ones who need to stay home. The virus is spread through asymptomatic carriers who may never know they have it (especially because we have so few tests). [Those carriers then spread it like wildfire, and a lot of people can die.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread/index.html) We need to be taking this seriously.\n\nSo look\u2026right now it\u2019s up to you what you do. You can keep going out and getting drinks and hanging out in crowds. But know that you could potentially be putting people in danger. And you can decide to come back here after break or stay with your parents. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. Maybe most of the scientific community is wrong. Maybe this is overblown and in two weeks it\u2019ll be great and schools will reopen. But please start reading the news and following what\u2019s happening. Then decide where you want to wait this out. It\u2019s entirely possible it could be 6-8 weeks rather than 1-2 weeks before things even somewhat resemble normalcy again. It\u2019s not a hoax. It\u2019s not overblown. It\u2019s dangerous.\n\nOh, and final thing\u2026please learn what basic statistics means. I\u2019ve seen so many people post \u201cit\u2019s just a 3% fatality rate!\u201d Here\u2019s some basic math for y\u2019all. Say the 3% is wrong; we\u2019ll go with 2%. Say 50% of people get it [(estimates could be 40-70% within a year);](https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/482794-officials-say-the-cdc-is-preparing-for) The US has 330 million people. 330/2 = 165 million. 2% (and it could be higher) of 165 million is 3.3 million people. That\u2019s an unbelievable number. Statistical literacy matters.\n\nSo please, please, please, please be safe out there wherever you went for Spring Break. And make an informed decision about where you'll feel safest after the break. And to all the trolls\u2026could you just skip this post, please? I\u2019m not in the mood.",

They've been on the brink of financial ruin for years to begin with. Their access to hospitals, medical equipment, well trained doctors, pharmaceuticals, as well as their culture, demographics, and their open border policies factor in massively to the seriousness of their situation. Just recently borders are being enforced; people have been allowed to come and go at will. We could get into the government controlled healthcare system but let's skip it.\n\nThe partnerships with American government &amp; our private sector is big; it's going to ramp up testing and treatments. American research is going to drive a lot of the situation. A much bigger concern is how we've allowed our supply of antibiotics to be completely controlled by the Chinese. THAT's a concern should the situation here explode. \n\nI live in an epicenter for infections in the NYC area. We've had one death, 69 year old man with multiple health issues including emphysema. It has been rampant in the Jewish community here, thank God no deaths yet. Only a few requiring hospitalization; the vast majority are quarantined at home, many asymptomatic, most have mild symptoms of the flu nature based on news reports and personal knowledge from the people themselves. \n\nI definitely agree about running out during spring break into massive crowds &amp; cramped bars. That's just idiotic. I understand the economic impact of canceling things, but people need to think about the ramifications of their choices. Our area has taken an economic hit in small business; restaurants, catering halls. It flows directly to the employees. I know people whole will be out of work for at least a month waiting to see what will happen, myself included for one of my jobs. I know another in the shipping industry who's had to take a 25% pay cut until things get better. The doctor for whom I work has seen a decided drop in patients because people - particularly the elderly, are wisely choosing to stay home. \n\nI agree about kids staying home if possible. But for many it's just not possible - I am so glad Clemson has decided to keep the campus open. \n\nWe'll get through this IF people think about others and not just our needs &amp; desires. Everyone needs to stay calm and sensible. And go easy on the toilet paper!",

Sure, our quality of care is the best in the world *if you can afford it.* How do you respond to lack of safety nets like paid sick leave, lunch for children, and the  uniquely American problem of having to worry about paying mortgages and loans off while being unable to work due to sickness? \n\nEvery single person in this country has a role to play in this pandemic, and if you think that we are well-equipped or that our leaders are preparing adequately you are very misinformed. South Korea and Japan are the only countries similar to Western democracies that have handled this crisis with any sort of adequate response. We are not even close to handling it that way, and to think we are ready for something this massive is foolish. Thankfully it was just SARS-CoV2 this time, because if this was something deadlier and less age-discriminate we would be in a lot of trouble.\n\nedit: read over your post again and it\u2019s plain you have absolutely no idea what you\u2019re talking about - antibiotics do not do anything to a VIRUS, something that is not living in the first place",

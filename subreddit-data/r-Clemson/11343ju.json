    "postText": "Tonight we, Drinking Trivially, host the start of a three month spring trivia tournament. (scores for each team banked over three months: Feb, Mar, Apr; on 3rd Wednesday).  Of course each night also has its own winner with prizes. No cost to play, just come and have fun.  We (Billy and Tim) spend a lot of time trying to create the best trivia night around and we think you will think so too if you come on out. \n\nSignups begin at 6:00, Play begins at 6:30.  \n\nWe hope to see you there!!",

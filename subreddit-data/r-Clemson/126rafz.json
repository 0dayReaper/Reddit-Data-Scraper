    "postText": "Hi, my name is Julio and I am a freshman from Panama entering Clemson this fall. I'm entering pre buisness and looking to live in Mickel hall. My native language is spanish, but I speak perfect english. I love sports either watching or playing them and my favorite sport is football which I have played for 12 years of my life and also I love playing videogames. I would say i'm a chill guy who likes to just hangout and play videogames and also sleep a lot. My plan is to rush as soon as possible my first semester in Clemson because both of my brothers have an they said it was an awesome experience.I'm looking for a roomate who is entering this fall who shares the same love for sports and videogames as I do and likes to keep his room clean and organized.",

    "postText": "So drop in tonight for some handcrafted, artisanal trivia hosted by us (Billy and Tim) at Pendleton Brewing company.   We are kicking off the fall season tournament tonight. (Rolling scores over next three months with a bigger prize at end of play in November). \n\nNo need to feel committed to the tourney either if you just want to come out tonight. But I'm guessing if you do tonight, you'll want to come back.  We take a lot of pride and spend a lot of time getting our questions together and our rounds just right.  We stand by our claim to be the best in the upstate ( and we hope you think so too). \n\nHope to see you there!",

We live in The Enclave at Old Central, 3 bed 2 bathroom apartment. 10 mins from Clemson and well taken care of. Rent is $1675 total so ~$558 per room. Water, internet, and trash pick up from front door included. \n\nWe are wanting to sign someone ASAP, preferably before the end of the month!\n\nPM for pictures and we can work out a deal!! We are happy to pay any fees that come with the takeover and will pay the June rent!",

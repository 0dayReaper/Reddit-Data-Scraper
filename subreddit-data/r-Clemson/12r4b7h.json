I\u2019ve seen people talk about award packages, etc. when applying to colleges but I haven\u2019t received any information regarding cost of attendance or grants or anything from Clemson so I\u2019m wondering how this works? Are expenses just estimates based in the cost calculator until I register or is there a way to get a more accurate picture of what college will cost? Thanks.",

The financial aid people are generally very helpful.",

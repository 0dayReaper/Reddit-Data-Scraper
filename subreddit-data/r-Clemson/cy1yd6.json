    "postText": "Y\u2019all really need to stop littering. Nothing keeps the stereotypes going like rich kids throwing cheap beers and white claws on the ground. We live on some beautiful land but most all of you don\u2019t give a fuck. I\u2019m tired of walking out in the morning and seeing that all these douches threw half empty beers into the grass. Are y\u2019all that smart? I\u2019m gonna keep picking these cans up but I\u2019m tired of seeing this amazing place being shitted on by drunk dicks.",

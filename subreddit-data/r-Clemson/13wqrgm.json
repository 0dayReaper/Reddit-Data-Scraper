Asking as i'm a trans guy and i've been worried about the political climate of the state in recent year(s).",

It isn\u2019t the school you went to. The liberals have destroyed it and are brainwashing the kids!\u201d \n\nSo if there is a tiny, tiny modicum of truth to my insane mother you\u2019ll probably be fine! \n\nI will say you\u2019re 100% going to a school in the south that is great for agriculture and many other things. You will 100% encounter POS rednecks but they never said anything to me. Never had a problem etc. I think you\u2019ll be fine, but also like use common sense and be smart of your surroundings. Just like walking in any city! \n\nIt\u2019s like my family all being like \u201cNYC IS SO DANGEROUS YOU CANT VISIT IT ANYMORE!\u201d Well I live in ATL and it\u2019s WAYYYY more dangerous \ud83d\ude02 just be smart of your surroundings! \n\nGood luck, join some clubs (or tiger band!) and you\u2019ll find some amazing friends and a great support system. Clemson is amazing and you\u2019ll enjoy it. Met my husband there!",

That's obviously relative though because it's still the south. I will say there were gay kids at school when I was there and I suspect that's still the case today with more of them being out.",

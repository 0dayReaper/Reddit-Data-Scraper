I'm struggling to keep up with the pace rn bc I'm still in session for quarter system and I am taking 7 courses along with this. I can get all the notes down but don't have too much time for practice problems. Good thing memorial day weekend is here!",

If you can\u2019t, just look up example problems. Circuits are just math puzzles. Eventually, with practice, it becomes easier to solve circuits. You need to understand the \u201cwhy\u201d more than the \u201chow\u201d and this is one class where I really recommend the \u201cwhy\u201d over the \u201chow\u201d. Once you know why something is done a certain way, it makes doing the problems significantly easier.",

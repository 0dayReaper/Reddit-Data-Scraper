If I remember correctly, the Town of Central would still expect your \"court costs\" even if the charges are dropped (as in, dash cam proves you didn't roll the stop sign and the officer saw you pulling forward after you stopped.) That was a decade ago and I don't know if they still do that, since it seems rather shady.",

He's trying to bring in as many students as possible but not putting in the infrastructure. As of my freshman year, undergraduate enrollment was around 20k. At the time, parking was abysmal, Catbus was strained at peak times, and traffic was always kinda bad around class exchange. Since then, they've taken out more parking than they've put in, they took out two dorm buildings and put in one new one, they've closed down the road by Tillman so nobody can get to the core of campus except by Perimeter, speed limits have been lowered, and they redid the roads by Sikes so there's just one light instead of two so nobody can get out of the parking lot there - all this while increasing undergraduate enrollment by about 20% in my four years. Traffic is horrendous and more undergraduate housing is being put up on already choked roads, parking is laughably inaccessible to the point where people in dorms have to park their cars in the overflow lot at night which only makes traffic worse during the day, and nothing has been done to help Catbus carry the increased number of students living off campus.\n\nAdd to this the years worth of construction projects on 93 that seemed to have no coordination with the town or local businesses, and most of my old favorites have closed up. Brioso's moved to GVille, Peppino's now serves a worse version of their pizza at Hendrix, and the only businesses that can afford to stay open on the main drag are bars, merch stores, and chain restaurants. All I have left is Spill the Beans, All In, and Your Pie.",

These \"mandates\" to wear masks in public cnanot be imposed upon citizens as they were not created through the Constitutional [Legislative process](https://www.congress.gov/legislative-process).\n\nMandates cannot legally be imposed upon private citizens as doing so is a violation of the Constitution of South Carolina and the U.S. Constitution. Only laws that have been passed through the legislative process can be upheld and enforced on citizens through Due Process, which these mandates also violate.\n\nMandates imposed on citizens are illegal, **and are violation of the Constitution under Article 1, Section 1.** Mandates like this are entirely outside the authority of the Governor or President and they cannot legally be enforced on citizens.\n\nGovernment employees? Yes. Executive Orders and Mandates **can** dictate bureaucratic policy within departments under the direction of the executive branch (Governor/President), but they cant be legally imposed on citizens. \nThe President can order all members of the military and the agencies/departments of the Cabinet to wear masks while on government property or executing official duties.\n\nMcMaster can order all state employees to wear masks, like university admins, police, healthcare, etc. on government property or executing official duties.\n\nThe City of Clemson can order all government employees to wear masks on government property or executing official duties.\n\nNone of those entities have any authority or right under the U.S. or State Constitutions to impose these mandates on private citizens, period. That authority is not granted to them and government regulations cannot be imposed upon citizens unless a law has been created and passed vis the Legislative Process.\n\nThese fines for not wearing a mask are blatantly illegal and shame on CUPD for choosing to enforce them.",

The university has one, but they cannot legally enforce it for people smoking outside, 20 feet away from a building.\n\n\n\nAlso, the 10th Amendment doesnt allow states to violated Article 1, Section 1.

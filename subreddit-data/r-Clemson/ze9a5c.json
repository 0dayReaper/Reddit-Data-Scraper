    "postText": "I am in my last semester right now, and so I applied for graduation in the beginning of the semester. I did all the paperwork and everything should be settled at this point. Now it\u2019s about 2 or 3 weeks before the graduation ceremony, and I haven\u2019t heard anything back. At all. \n\nI contacted my advisor and they confirmed that I did all the paperwork, and that all they were waiting on was my final grades. While I understand final grades are important to graduate in my final semester, it feels weird I\u2019ve been given no information about graduating up to this point. The only information I have is what\u2019s available on the website entailing what and when the event is. Questions like \u201cwhere do I get my cap and gown\u201d lIs there some kind of procedure I should know\u201d lIs there a class like CU1000 I needed to take alongside my last semester\u201d are all unanswered right now.\n\nI\u2019ve just been very unsatisfied with the radio silence this semester, and I wanted to know if others experienced the same thing.",

If anything I would search your emails and look through your spam folders.",

Next, go see if the bookstore has any leftover cap and gowns because the grad fair this semester was in October.",

            "comment": "Take this with a large grain of salt as I have no experience with medical education. I'll try to be as unbiased as possible, but I'm definitely biased towards Clemson personally, although I grew up in Columbia so I'm pretty familiar with UofSC and I do think they're a fine school too.\n\nAs someone who has attended multiple schools and has multiple degrees, here are my thoughts; when it comes to the difference between two major public universities like Clemson and UofSC, there's not necessarily any difference in terms of the level of prestige associated with a degree from either of the two, so I personally don't think that either one would hurt/help your chances of getting into med school just based on the prestige of the degree alone, if that's something you were worried about.\n\nAs you said though, there might be differences with networking and opportunities. That's something I know nothing about for med stuff so it might really be true that one school is better than the other for that, but in general what I've always heard (and found true for myself) is that what matters more is what you make of the opportunities in a given place. In other words, I'm sure that either place has opportunities. The types of opportunities and other stuff might differ, but there will always be opportunities to apply yourself.\n\nAs a personal example, I majored as an undergrad in Spanish and Communication Studies at Clemson, but I ended up going to grad school at a different place for Spanish Linguistics. Even though I had no real background in linguistics, I could point to my knowledge of Spanish and my social science education from Comm Studies, and if anything it showed to my grad school that I had diverse interests and knowledge. Sometimes that is even more important to them than having specialized knowledge as an undergrad (of course, that might be different for med school, again I have no idea about that specifically).\n\nThe last thing, that imo is even more important than the \"tangible benefits\", is just where do you think you'd be happier, and have more fun? If you like a spot more and just see yourself feeling more at home there, then you'll probably do better in school there too.\n\nGood luck with your decision, I'm sure you'll do well at either school! :)",

            "comment": "I just finished my masters in biology at Clemson and have been at the university for all three degrees (currently working on my doctorate). I\u2019ve worked with probably over 100 students over the course of my time at Clemson who have ended up going into the medical field. I also grew up about an hour from Carolina. \n\nClemson has excellent access to things which medical schools love. This means diversifying yourself as far as your interests and experiences. Their undergraduate research (CI) program has been cited by many, many graduates who have gone on to medical school as to why they got in. The biology program is really amazing (not sure of your major but I would anticipate you are taking biology courses). The professors are generally willing to help you individually and build a relationship with you. Same goes for the graduate students - we genuinely want the best for our undergrads. I had many friends go through Carolina\u2019s biology program and hate it, but many eventually got into a good medical school. A few did really like it, but did say it was a bit tougher to find extra help than they would have liked. \n\nAt the end of the day, either school can help you get into a good medical school. It comes down to what YOU want out of a school. Clemson is a rural school with the closest \u201cbig\u201d city an hour away. The nature around Clemson is amazing, though and there is plenty outdoorsy things to do. It is also SIGNIFICANTLY safer than Carolina - my wife works with the police department and there is almost no crime compared to almost every other part of the state and every other campus. Clemson is also known for its family atmosphere. For the most part, people are very kind to and supportive of each other. The two big drawbacks to the school are the lack of things to do (compared to a city) and the lack of diversity, which is a pretty big issue honestly. Like I said, I\u2019ve been around Clemson a long time and there is some bias here. But I really encourage you to base your decision off of your interests, not just how likely you are to get into med school.",

MUSC will add points to your gpa to reflect that during the application process. There are pre-med organizations at Clemson you can join and Clemson does a big event called Tigers on Call for networking with medical professionals.",

Most UofSC people I\u2019ve met are trying to go for the best college experience, and not focused on getting a career and you can tell. Clemson is kinda similar but kinda not. \n\nIf you say Clemson is your dream school, then follow your dreams, but I\u2019m a bit biased. I absolutely love it here but it takes a bit of effort to find a solid group if you\u2019re not in Greek life, but my friend group are all genuine people who are probably going to go do great things in life.",

            "comment": "So I have friend in Italy rn who\u2019s doing the study abroad portion of the architecture minor. He\u2019s doing it to make his Civil Engineering degree look more week rounded, but he didn\u2019t add the minor until this year and he\u2019s a junior. and from him and then my architecture major roommate, be prepared for some late nights in the studio. If you\u2019re a STEM degree, might be easier to have one year of normal classes before adding it as a minor so that you can adjust to the workload, because honestly, archies probably have the highest work load at the school\n\nThe wording the last sentence has me a bit confused so I just want to make sure you understand that it takes multiple semesters to get the minor, including one semester abroad that is mandatory.",

The description on the Clemson website was very brief and I\u2019m not too familiar with minors but that\u2019s good to know that it takes multiple semesters. I\u2019m a music major so I don\u2019t really need it but it\u2019s something I\u2019m really interested in, thanks for all the information!!",

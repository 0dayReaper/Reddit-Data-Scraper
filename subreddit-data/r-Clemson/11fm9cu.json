Either go pre med or transfer to another school my junior year into their nursing program\n\n2) go to my state school where nursing is my major\n\n3) try to get into clemson\u2019s nursing program after first semester (highly doubt)",

Just wanted to say that option 2 would be the best if you wanna go 100% nursing while option 3 is too risky to do a major you don\u2019t want PLUS there\u2019s a chance there\u2019s not a seat for you in Clemson nursing. \n\n\nGood luck. Rejection is redirection. You are gonna rock wherever you go and be the best nurse making big banks",

Since it is a direct admission into the major it becomes a denial for such major if not accepted into it. Admission to the college in general works for those who are undecided or may be a fit for any major. I simply had a path I wanted to follow and prefer not to change that. No wrong or right in it all. I just don\u2019t need to settle for a random major if it is not part of my intended career. I had hope that there would be a First Year Change of Major track to join the Accelerated Nursing program as a last resort, but thanks for your response.",

            "comment": "Is that Instrumentation? Took that a couple years ago, it was alright I think. Learned about a lot of different devices one might use, how they work, what purpose you might use them for, etc. It was actually kind of interesting usually. \n\nAs far as tests go you learn a lot of formulas and use them to solve problems. You can make a formula sheet, as usual in EE. There\u2019s a couple different formulas for each device you learn so there ends up being a ton of formulas, also as usual in EE lol. But overall wasn\u2019t too hard of a class I\u2019d say.\n\nActually there was also a presentation you had to do, about a technology that you research individually. That was the hardest part for sure. The prof was a little vague with what he actually wanted on our presentation and left it a little too open ended. I got a B on both of mine, not really sure why tbh. My exam scores lifted me back to an A so it was all good, but just thought I should mention the presentation part too.",

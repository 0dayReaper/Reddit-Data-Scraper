I signed at Heritage at Riverwood a couple days ago and they only had one 2 bed 2 bath left. You'll probably find more luck on the Facebook housing group, I (23 M) just posted looking for a grad roommate. A studio unit is going to be hard to find, so if money isn't an issue you should be able to rent out a 2 bed 2 bath place, there was one available at Woodlands that people said was quiet, idk about the running.",

I just let them know last week, so if you called them earlier they might have said they were full. It\u2019s a 2 bed/2 bath, $1075/mo (cats are additional $75/mo/cat, no dogs allowed). It\u2019s a top corner unit, so nice and quiet and great for grad students, especially if you split with a friend. If interested, you can call or visit their leasing office and ask about unit 104P. I walk/jog throughout the complex all the time and have always felt very safe. It\u2019s nice and woodsy (even saw a deer the other day!).",

    "postText": "It's disappointing not to make the tournament but this group of players is worth showing up for. Tyson, Galloway, Hemmingway are all seniors who have made this school proud and really left it all out there, great players who embody the Clemson spirit. I don't know any details about tickets but this is a special group of guys. Pack little john, I think we could actually go far in this thing, gutted not to make the dance but fucking pumped that we could potentially have 3 more home games.",

My family doesn\u2019t really know much about college applications or how to get looked at for soccer. I\u2019m planning to visit Clemson for my senior college visit trip and would like to contact the soccer coach or something like that. Any tips? Help? Guidance? Anything helps\u2026 I tried googling but I want more anecdotal experience \nThanks",

Given that it\u2019s a successful D1 program, you might not have luck with trying to contact them, but it\u2019s not like there\u2019s an inherent downside to trying\n\nSpecifically if you can find some contact info I\u2019d try sending whatever film you have on yourself and your big accomplishments.",

ID camps are probably the biggest thing because coaches will want to see you matched up against other players that want to play in college.",

Obviously if you play at the high club level that\u2019s the main way to get noticed. Like others have said the ID camps are the best way to gain direct exposure and also allow you to get a feel for the program. Unfortunately D1 programs don\u2019t really pay attention to Varsity HS (at least to my knowledge). To be brutally honest however, if you don\u2019t play club at the ECNL it\u2019ll be very hard to be recruited by a program like Clemson. If all else fails, come to Clemson and try to walk on. And if that doesn\u2019t work, try out for the club team. A few of the guys from my high school are on the team and they just won their region and went to nationals.",

Ask em to show your game footage to the coaching staff.\n\nWithout the money and helicopter parents to do that, your best bet is going to their camp this summer.  That also costs money.\n\nThen, it's play for your club team in a big tournament and upstage the guys that are getting scouted.  The best solution is to talk to your club coach and let them give you a real assessment of what the best plan would be.  Best piece of coaching I ever got.",

Another thing to keep in mind is that college sports, especially D1, are very hard to get into. I played soccer in highschool as well, and would\u2019ve loved to play for Clemson, but the cards just weren\u2019t in my favor. There\u2019s always club and intramural soccer if the collegiate team doesn\u2019t pan out for you. Best of luck!",

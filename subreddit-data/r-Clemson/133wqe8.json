Currently driving to Greenville to get their microchip read (hopefully they have one).\n\nAdditionally, I have a cat and in case they do not have a microchip, I will need to find someone to hold on to them for the night until the shelters are open tomorrow since I can't hold onto them. If you're able, please help me out. Thanks.",

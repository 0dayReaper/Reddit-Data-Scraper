    "postText": "I used to major in a music-related area so I didn\u2019t question my ability to use the piano practice rooms. However now I\u2019m no longer a music major and have no classes in brooks. \n\nWould I be able to still use those rooms even if I\u2019m not a music major? I\u2019d of course be conscious of actual music majors and performers that need to use the rooms and try to plan accordingly around their schedules. I just have no access to a piano in my current living situation and would really like to use one.",

If you walk to the back of the hall you\u2019ll enter into a new hall with probably about 10~ different practice rooms, each one having its own piano. The rooms aren\u2019t exactly sound-proof, but it\u2019s a great resource for anyone on campus that wants to learn or practice a musical instrument.",

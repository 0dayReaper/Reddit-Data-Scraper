    "postText": "Hey everyone!\n\nAs the title explained, need a little help. My best friend is a huge CFB fan and has a bucket list to see every D-1 football stadium and campus. He attended the Clemson vs. Miami game this past weekend and sat upper deck. For some reason, he could not find/locate a program to purchase in the upper deck (there were program kiosks but they were not staffed in the upper deck sections) and they were not allowing fans down to the lower sections/concessions. He collects a program from every game attended as memorabilia from the game, (he\u2019s literally bought one from every game attended, plus printed two programs that were digital copies only). \n\nWould anyone be able to assist in mailing the program from last weekend\u2019s game vs Miami or know of a way to obtain one? Obviously he would cover all expenses to ship. \n\nThanks for your help in advance!",

    "postText": "Hello Clemson gen chem students! I am offering free chemistry help for general chemistry students via YouTube. Every Wednesday at 7pm I have an interactive live stream on general chemistry topics. This week we are working on oxidation states and balancing redox equations. You are welcome to join in and ask questions in the chat and request other chemistry topics/problems for future live streams.\n\nI have my masters in chemistry and was a college professor (mostly general chemistry, but a bit of organic as well) for ten years. The YouTube channel is Chem Help ASAP (link here: [https://www.youtube.com/c/ChemHelpASAP](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChemHelpASAP)) I hope I can help you understand chemistry a bit better!",

Regarding the self teaching question you asked, yes, if you end up with the bad professors. I\u2019d recommend asking around when you get here for previous experiences and do your research. I had my fair share of poor professors and it made for a semester of googling and doing every thing with a group of people so we could teach eachother.",

I guess the moral of the story is make tons of connections, be friendly and outgoing, and go to all the job fairs and whatnot that Clemson offers. You never know who you\u2019ll meet.",

There will be periods where you\u2019re super busy, but I think that will be the case pretty much anywhere.\n\nI\u2019ve done primarily C/C++ in my classes, I think the department is moving away from C a little bit which may be for the best.\n\nLike others have mentioned there are a couple bad apple professors, but just ask around and you\u2019ll know who to avoid for certain classes. The vast majority are perfectly reasonable, just trying to teach the material. \n\nAs the sun begins to set on my college career, I won\u2019t miss the midterms/finals crunches, but I\u2019ve certainly enjoyed my time here.",

While this is nice to have, it ultimately depreciates the essence of Computer Science.\n\nTo OP: the CS curriculum is becoming Software Development Studies. In general, for all classes regardless of topic, you should expect to learn the material by yourself (internet has a richness of resources that a single professor just can\u2019t provide). If you want a degree, go for it, but if you learn only what they instruct, then don\u2019t expect to truly understand how a computer functions.",

Twice yearly there is a massive job fair on campus where you can talk to potential employers, there's an entire day of the job fair specifically for engineering/computer science. In addition to that there is a strong co-op program on campus where an advisor is assigned to you and they help you find an internship/co-op. This summer I'll be doing my second rotation at a company (I'm a sophomore).\n\nThere are definitely a couple rough professors here, but all in, most of them have been fine. They are helpful during office hours and some of them are able to offer great insights into the industry. I'm currently helping with research for one of the professors and he is a wealth of knowledge in regards to the industry.\n\nPersonally, I have had a generally positive experience. The classes are tough, they're supposed to be, this isn't an easy major. But it's also the best CS program in the state iirc.\n\nThere's plenty of work to do outside of class but that's how every stem major is. Hope this helps!",

    "postText": "So I am most likely going to be doing an business internship this summer and it's super last minute, but long story short, it'll be under a **family member's company** so that's why not everything is set in place yet. It won't be super formal of course for this reason but I'll still be working as an intern 3-5 days a week and getting paid so it's not like I'm not doing anything if that makes sense. How can I get Clemson to approve this internship? My major is LAIB and I am required to do an international internship but I figured I'll do that junior/senior year ( I'm a rising sophomore). I just thought why not take this opportunity to gain experience while I can. So even though it's not required (that I know of because it's not international) is there any way I can get any credit from this internship because I don't really know how to go about it \"establishing\" it as an official internship (never done this shit before so I know that's the wrong terminology). I don't know what I am doing lol, just don't wanna go through with this without making sure if it could benefit me or advance my major fulfillments or requirements or anything like that. I feel like just having it on my resume and LinkedIn won't be enough. If anyone has any input or experience in a situation like mine, it would be greatly appreciated, thanks.",

Definitely talk to your advisor to see if it could count towards credits somewhere in DegreeWorks. But if it doesn\u2019t, then I\u2019d still recommend doing it, even if Clemson doesn\u2019t acknowledge it. This experience will undoubtedly help boost your resume to get an even better internship when you\u2019re applying for your \u201cofficial\u201d one that is required.",

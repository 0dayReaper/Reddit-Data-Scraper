Both Houston and Clemson are good schools.\n\nName really only matters for Ivy League schools, top 3 universities for that major (example GA tech or John Hopkins for BioMedE), or degree factories that are likely to lose their accreditation",

The first 3 are seen as superior pretty much anywhere in the country. Same could be said for maybe 10-15 other non IVY. In general though I think you\u2019re right",

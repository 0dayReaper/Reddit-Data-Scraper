I already have a job lined up so was hoping to do them asynchronously. \n\n**Any advice on other schools/programs to take the following classes asynchronously?** \n\nPHYS 2080\n\nCH 2240 \n\nAVS 1500  (probably a stretch for this one)",

Definitely do it soon because most 8 or 10 week courses start on the 15th",

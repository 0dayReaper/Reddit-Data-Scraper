    "postText": "I decided to take summer classes outside of Clemson this summer and will be a rising senior. My advisor told me to make sure i\u2019m not surpassing the maximum number of credits that can be taken elsewhere during my last two years at Clemson. I\u2019m only taking 6 credit hours elsewhere and when I asked, he doesn\u2019t even know what the maximum is. Does anyone know? I cant seem to find in on the registrars website either. Thanks!",

To paraphrase, it\u2019s something like \u201cX credits of your last Y credits must be taken at Clemson\u201d\n\nI\u2019m 90% sure it\u2019s 37/43 but like I said definitely try and ask another advisor.\n\nE:  yes it\u2019s 37/43, found a random document on my computer from when I was worried about this exact problem. I cannot it on google.  It is titled \u201cTransfer Policy 17a8fc\u201d if you want to try.",

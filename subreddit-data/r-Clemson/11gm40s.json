Summer start mainly helps the university keep freshman year class sizes down, so the university thinks you\u2019re  capable of the rigor, but could likely benefit from taking some classes over the summer and getting acclimated to college life. It is a super great program and you make a ton of connections with other summer kids. If Clemson is your dream school, then summer start is still a great option!",

HOWEVER, what I didn\u2019t like, I called them to ask about summer bridge, they said you\u2019d have to pay summer room and board and meal plan. Paying the tuition is understandable too, but living on campus for summer is required. Then, you\u2019d also have to pay normal fall rates to live on campus",

            "comment": "There isn\u2019t a simple reason for why you got Summer Start. It\u2019s kind of a mystery to a lot of people because some of the smartest and (dumbest) people will be in it. It\u2019s essentially random. With that said, Summer Start was one of the best summers i\u2019ve ever had. Like others have said you get 2 maybe 3 general education classes done with which helps a lot in the fall. You also get to be at Clemson when the lake is at its best.\nI would recommend on going in with an open mind and making some good friends. You can go to Y beach or the rowing docks whenever you want until about 10 pm and basically other then a handful of unlucky people the cops don\u2019t enforce much in the summer.",

    "postText": "This past week I was pulled over because I didn't come to a full stop at a stop sign. I gave the officer all my info and I got my ticket. For some reason though, my ticket didn't have a price total on it. The officer told me that instead of charging me with failure to stop at a stop sign, he would charge me with \"failure to exercise due care while operating a motor vehicle\" which he said doesn't put any points on my license instead of failure to stop at a stop sign. At the time he didn't tell me how much this ticket would be and nowhere on my traffic ticket does it state a total balance. However now that I just checked up on it online, the balance that I owe is $232.50. For something that doesn't even put any points on my license, I feel like it's completely unreasonable. Also, it seems like the maximum fine for running a stop sign/red light is $100 so how in the world can this ticket that is supposed to be less of an infraction cost more than double? Does anyone have experience with tickets like this or know what I can do to have it reduced? The status of the ticket is still under \"Pending\" if that means anything. Here's the breakdown of the ticket cost: https://imgur.com/a/NA75Fkg",

If you have no other points on your driving record and you take responsibility for the ticket, it will be reduced. I would NOT use any excuse that I am a poor college student or that you didn't commit the violation, those excuses will not get you the result you are looking for. You can say that you didn't realize you commited the violation, but be humble and take responsibility. I would 1st go to where you pay for the ticket and see if they can do anything for you to lower the cost and points, if not, then go to the court time listed on your ticket. Go early, in many cases, you can talk with the officer and/or the court administrator before court starts and get the ticket lowered or removed completely. If you have no points on your driving record currently, I would get a copy of your 3-year record and take it with you. Don't demand or have an attitude, be respectful, take responsibility and be humble - you will get a lot further. The court will always side with the Police Officer, so trying to say you didn't do the violation or disparage the Police Officer will get you absolutely nothing, except the full payment of the ticket and points.

If it has been more than 2-years since the speeding ticket, it should have no impact on this ticket. I still think you can get it reduced either way by following the steps from my post. You may also want to offer taking a SC Defense Driving Class at your court date. By offering to do the class, they should waive the ticket all together.

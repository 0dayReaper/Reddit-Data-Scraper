            "comment": "As other's have suggested, please reach out to us for proper assistance, but based on this one sentence description, it sounds like you enabled Exchange (employee email system) on your account or someone had it provisioned for you. This could have been for an on-campus job or even for a class you are taking. This is a common request so students can utilize all functions and features of Microsoft Teams. You can verify this for yourself by visiting https://clemson.edu/emailforwarding. \n\nThe **why** you aren't getting your email is due to a feature of Exchange. The Exchange server knows you as your username@clemson.edu email address. If someone with an Exchange account (employees, university systems, etc.) send an email to your official Clemson address, Exchange says, \"hey I know /u/samyulls, their mailbox is right over here. Let me save everyone some time, and I will just pop it in their inbox.\" The mail never gets sent back to the campus mail servers where we can say \"no, /u/samyulls actually wants their mail over in Google.\"\n\nNow what do you do about it? Assuming I'm right and there is a reason you have an Exchange account, I would suggest logging into 365.clemson.edu, opening the Outlook app, and configuring a rule to forward messages to your @g.clemson.edu address. If there is absolutely no reason you need an Exchange account, you can clear out the mailbox and email ithelp@clemson.edu to ask us to delete the mailbox for you.\n\nIf I am accurate in my diagnosis, I would like to know more about the situation and how you ended up with an Exchange account without this side effect being explained to you. This is how students miss important emails from their professors, Financial Aid, etc., and is a contributing factor to the upcoming changes to our email infrastructure.",

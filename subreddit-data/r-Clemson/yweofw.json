    "postText": "Hey everyone!  My husband and I are transplants from Wisconsin and have adopted Clemson as our local team.  We are committed!  \n\nWe\u2019re going to our first game this Saturday against the \u201cU\u201d and we\u2019re so excited!  We have a hotel room close to Death Valley and I\u2019m looking for info on what we need to do.  \n\nGo Tigers!\n\nEdit for our experience:  It was a BLAST.  We wound up at Esso\u2019s because it was the closest to where our hotel was and we were there early enough to get a table.  Damn it\u2019s hilly around there!\n\nA random family asked us if they could sit with us (at Esso\u2019s) as we had a 6 top to ourselves and they immediately adopted us as family.  We MISSED THE TIGER WALK by minutes but that\u2019s ok because this lovely family brought us back to their car for more tailgate cocktails, I had moonshine for the first time, and then they guided us to our gate. Amazing.\n\nAfter the game, we walked to where our shuttle was back to our hotel, got to chatting with some sweet people in line for said shuttle, and when we got to our stop, they offered us a ride to our hotel, which we kindly accepted because even though it was only a few blocks, it was all uphill.  \n\nMan, you people are soooo nice. People in Wisconsin are nice but today was a different kind of nice.  Thank you for all of your suggestions and advice.  We got our Clemson feet wet today and will definitely be back!  \n\nIt was an amazing experience.",

            "comment": "The actual game is only half of the experience in my opinion, get out and about early and walk through the tailgates and soak it all in, it\u2019s a great time! The bars and shops Downtown are also always hopping before and after the game which I would recommend for your first time. Tiger town tavern is the bar that reflects clemson culture the most (and the best deal downtown of $2 PBR tall boys lol), and if you want to get some pregame clemson gear, tiger sports shop right next to it has the best section. \n\nAnywhere you go will be a great time tho, and I hope y\u2019all have a great day, welcome and Go tigers!",

If you\u2019re thinking of driving anywhere from 12-9 PM, forget it.",

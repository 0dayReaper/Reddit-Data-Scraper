(human sexual behavior, haha) its super important content for everyone to know and the old professor used to make it super easy on purpose! there's a new professor now, but from my understanding she's trying to keep it as close to the old class as possible.\n\n there's 4 tests and a final as well as some homework stuff and you can exempt both the 4th exam and the final if you do well enough on everything else. it's technically a psychology class, but it's the only one that doesn't require you to have taken Intro to Psych, and it'll count as a social science credit as well i believe (if you need one of those). definitely check it out! i think the course number is PSYCH 3060",

            "comment": "**Clemson Downtown** \\- It's still the same vibe (bars, athletic shops, and college grub) but now with taller buildings and parking garages.  Axe throwing is fun. No reason not to walk it again!  \n**Botanical Gardens** \\- It's gotten some improvements over the years.  Still beautiful.  \n**Patrick Square** \\- Newish subdivision with expensive homes and \"built-in\" shops / restaurants.  Rick Erwin'$ is here, along with a few other interesting options.  \n**Clemson Marina Grill** \\- Would recommend in the summer.  Burgers and fries by the lake, staring at the stadium.  Quintessential Clemson.  \n**Pendleton Square** \\- Pendleton square has grown some. It often has live music. The Blue Heron moved here. 1826 is - IMHO - the best small plate restaurant in Clemson area.  You'll also find a few breweries / beer gardens nearby.  If morning, don't miss the Village Baker's fresh pastries!\n\nFurther out ...  \n**The Silos** \\- In Easley, a new cluster of restaurants that always has live music.  \n**Nature** \\- Further out is all of the same hikes and trails: Brasstown, Issaquena falls, Foothills Trails, Tablerock.  \n**Greenville** \\- Vastly different than the 80s/90s.  It is now gorgeous, bursting with life, and very walkable.  Walk the Falls Park bridge.  Favorites: The Anchorage and the Trappe Door.  \n**Cashiers/Highlands** \\- Get up into the mountains and visit some quaint shoppes.  Cashiers has good hikes and kid and dog friendly Whiteside brewery.  The Highlands has Thyme restaurant and ice skating!  Sapphire Valley ski slope is nearby.  \n**Asheville** \\- Definitely has a unique vibe .... and like Greenville, too much too list ... but now we're very far from Clemson.  Still worth the drive.",

About 10 minutes from campus but only open Thursday through Saturday. There\u2019s still not a ton to do for non-students in the area though outside of naturey stuff and the lakes imo but hopefully there\u2019s other suggestions",

Apparently they sometimes vet each other based on account age and site activity for ticket/parking pass sales. \n\nOr so I\u2019m told. We both went to Clemson but one of us spends 2+ hours a day on tigernet and the other one is me \ud83d\ude02",

We had great seats (lower home side near student section) and parking, and then prices skyrocketed even worse than ever.  We determined we could buy great seats and parking for the games we wanted to see (or even all of them) and come out way better than we were doing.  Just FYI.  Unless you donate a massive amount, you need to be members forever to even get the opportunity to empty your pockets for good spots.  Our great seats came courtesy of a family that had tickets for over 40 years (not us LOL, we just paid the bill when they got to old to use them).",

Like other said tigernet is the best option. Though Clemson tickets on Facebook also has them. The earlier they purchase they more they will cost. I wouldn\u2019t expect to think about purchasing one until Aug.",

I know that i have to do the aep program, but does anyone know about how much the fine plus this will cost? Also will clemson report any of this to my parents since the ra took my name and information down? Will this have any affect on the scholarship that i have to be here? any responses will be helpful. this is the first run in that i've had with the cops and i'm freaking out abt the whole thing.",

Take the more expensive one if you're 18/19 because if you get another one, you can get it expunged with the cheaper option later.  If you go the cheaper one now, it'll be more difficult if you get a second.\n\nIf you're close to your 21st and aren't worried about a second, cheaper option is fine.\n\nParents will not be notified UNLESS you list your parent's address during the process.  If you do that, your expungement notice will be mailed to THEIR address.\n\nAlso note that underage drinking on campus is a violation to the RHA, so if you're in community council or anything under them you'll have to resign.",

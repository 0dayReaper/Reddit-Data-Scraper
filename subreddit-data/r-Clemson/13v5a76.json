    "postText": "I an planning to start as a freshman this fall and am currently enrolled as a mechanical engineering major. I don\u2019t want to study this and have requested to begin as an undeclared major. However, online I was told that they will not be reviewing major change requests until July. I have a meeting scheduled to select courses in about two weeks. Will I be forced to take engineering courses, even if I don\u2019t want to?",

You\u2019re gonna be just fine, but I encourage you to figure out what you\u2019re planning on spending so much time and money on!",

If not there is a second group of advisor meeting in July you could be asked to be moved to once your major is sorted out? I\u2019d email the person you have your advising appointment with asap and ask them how to handle- good luck! And xo grata on your acceptance to Clemson!!!!! Go Tigers!",

If you don't start engineering from the beginning, you will definitely be on campus an extra year. Otherwise, you just need to know if you are majoring in STEM or something else for planning purposes. You can take core classes this year, but they need to be for STEM if that's where you are heading.",

            "comment": "As someone else already hinted, there are plenty of people who get accepted to Clemson for a major they don\u2019t specifically want, and end up having to change later on. So, I wouldn\u2019t worry to much about being \u201cstuck\u201d choosing classes you don\u2019t want to take. Just voice your plan and concerns with your advisor and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get you on the right track. However, take it from me who was a transfer student to Clemson and didn\u2019t have many classes transfer over, I would recommend you figure out the direction you want to go. You don\u2019t have to do it before starting classes in the fall, but I\u2019d say before your sophomore year you definitely need to choose a path. If not, you risk out on losing a good bit of time and money. A lot of majors at Clemson (and most colleges) have classes specifically tailored to that major. So there aren\u2019t many pre-reqs you can take that will transfer to most majors. Btw, I\u2019m not saying this to scare you or make you feel like you have to make a decision asap, I\u2019m just making you aware of the consequences of being undeclared. But as mentioned before, you should be fine to switch out of engineering for the time being. If you have any more questions, lmk. Good luck!",

I'm gonna get an associates in IT because my history degree at Clemson has kept me in employment purgatory (stuck between 40-50k/year) in the hospitality industry.\n\nI wanna work remotely/from home to spend more time with my dog and fixing up my soon to be fiancee's house.\n\nI loved studying history at Clemson and my profs were excellent, but the only real career path is either what I described, grad school for History (which they even told us at career days not to do as the market for professors and historians is saturated), or law school. I have zero desire to increase my loan balance by going to grad or law school, so I'm going back to get an associates where I can afford the classes without taking out extra loans.\n\nI really wish I would have done my first 2 years at a Community College and then transferred over after that.",

My boyfriend got his associated in IT a couple years ago after his Philosophy degree wasn\u2019t getting him anywhere. He\u2019s quite happy with his choice. \n\nI\u2019m really not sure how I leveraged my history degree to find success in my current, very unrelated, field. I was a bit worried when I first graduated about finding a career. Like you, I loved my professors and it was an enjoyable experience, which is more than I can say for a lot of friends who majored in communications or business.",

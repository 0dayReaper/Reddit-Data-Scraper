Johnstone and harcombe aren\u2019t used unless they need to temporarily house people for any reason (issues in other dorms, camps, etc.). Some of those lights are either just kept on or come from in the union building since there are offices still being used there, so that\u2019s also what you might be seeing.",

They all have been used as offices before the business building was finished. It was supposed to be tore down this year but covid delayed that school needed the money. It will be torn down and green space in less than 5 years i swear just if its 2 years or 5 no one knows. Biggest questions are where does ya know mail room, parking, CUSG, and not to mention the student union go in the mean time to not diminish students experience \n\nBecoming the tiger involves filing out a secret application you have to seek out ask your cheerleader friends they can help, then some get an interview, then if you make it that far they will let you come and practice a few times then you have to tryout with a 2 minute skit. For tiger pushups are a huge component as well 50 is recommended to be competitive 80 if he wants to get the job. Their is a book on it if your brother is really interested, it tells the stories of old tigers I read it once",

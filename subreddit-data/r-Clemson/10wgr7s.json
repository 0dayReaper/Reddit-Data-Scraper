    "postText": "What is Clemson even on? I am a transfer student from a technical college and this is fucking insane. I literally have Covid and I am sick but one of my professors is threatening to reduce my grade if I don't go to class. I have called the student success center and undergraduate studies and both sent me to the department he is in, only the department didn't answer the phone the number of times I called them between 3pm and 6pm. Even if I do get a hold of them, the two departments I did call basically said professors are allowed to do whatever they want regarding absences, even if you have Covid. What am I supposed to do? Just go to class and risk infecting everyone?\n\nUpdate: The professor has cancelled class due to illness. If it is Covid like I assume it is that means it is circulating on campus bc I was not within six feet of him at any point. I am sure you guys have also been around people who are chalking up their coughs and stuffy noses to colds. Stay safe and avoid anyone who is sick.",

They could be right that their workers won't die from COVID, but they will certainly spread it to people who WILL die from it.  The workers won't necessarily be able to quit either without some form of government intervention, since it'd be a voluntary quit and they would be unable to collect unemployment, and without money to pay rent they'd likely become homeless (again, without the eviction freeze) and become more at risk for contracting the virus.\n\n&gt;\tPersonally I'm staying home because I don't want to catch the virus but that should be a CHOICE not a mandate.\n\nThe problem with that is that this choice does not only affect you. If you are not making an effort to distance or wearing a mask, it is very likely that you will catch the virus *and spread it to others*, possibly before you even realize that you have it.  Some of the people who get the virus from you or down the line from those people will be hospitalized, and some of them will die.  Unfortunately, a lot of people don't really care if it doesn't affect them, and decide that they are probably low risk and then refuse to stay home because they think they won't die if they catch the virus, never mind all the people they will end up killing.\n\nThe other problem is that this country is full of idiots, including a substantial amount of [people who believe Bill Gates is using it to implant microchips in everyone](https://news.yahoo.com/new-yahoo-news-you-gov-poll-shows-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-spreading-on-the-right-may-hamper-vaccine-efforts-152843610.html).  If the people here were rational and empathetic, maybe the individualistic route would work, but unfortunately we have to share this country with smoothbrains who think cellular towers cause the virus.  These people are also threatening others, especially since they may not even believe the virus itself is real, and really the only way to stop them from causing a bunch of deaths is to just close businesses and impose stay at home orders.",

    "postText": "I'm currently working \\~20 hours/week in a lab as an undergrad and an extra 12 hours at night with another job (trying to replace this since it's in Anderson).\n\nI'm burning the hell out trying to make rent and tuition, switching between day and night hours. Is there anything else nearby besides being a lab rat for CU? Has anyone had any luck in this area?\n\nIf possible, I'd like to find a position not under CU, since I'll be running into issues with the 28 hour student labor cap. Also, I couldn't commute more than 20 minutes each way.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, PMs are welcome.",

That might seem like a bad idea, but it's far better to do well in your classes and research than trying to graduate without debt. You'll make up the loans with better job prospects and a more solid career trajectory. You'll also save yourself stress, both now and when looking for jobs.",

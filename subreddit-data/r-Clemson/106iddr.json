    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI am writing this post as I am wanting to gather some information as it pertains to best bars on campuses around the nation to create a website so college football fans know where the best bars are at for their favorite college football team.\n\nBelow are some questions I am looking for a response?\n\nBest pregame bar before Clemson football games? Why is it the best pregame bar?\n\nBest bar to watch Clemson football games? Why is it the best watch party bar?\n\nBest postgame bar after Clemson football games? Why is it the best post game bar?\n\nAny information is extremely helpful and appreciated. I can\u2019t wait to see some of the responses.\n\nThank you",

We havent been able to find any apartments in Seneca and although Clemson is a little bit of a drive for him we dont have much options. We would preferably like something in West Clemson but I couldnt find anything for non-students. Our budget is around $1500. Any recommendations??",

When I moved up last October we had luck at Rosewood. It'd be a bit of a hike to Seneca, but it had a lot of non-students and a few openings at that time",

I tried using the cuapps thing but I just kept getting error messages when logging in. Same thing for the VPN.\n\nAnyone else having similar issues and know how to fix it? Or is this a CCIT situation?",

I have to login then it opens the chrome tab inside your chrome tab then you login again and that works for me. Sadly I asked an advisor about it and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going away which is incredibly annoying because the old system was so much more useable.",

I live in the cottages, and sometimes I hear music from parties there, but if that\u2019s your thing, then I guess that\u2019s good.\n\nI have heard using the ridge bus is a good perk though, as you won\u2019t have to pay for a parking pass.\n\nHope this helped!",

It's still relatively new, so my unit was in good condition (coming from UV, it was night and day). There's a bus that goes to campus, if you don't have a car. \n\nThe bad: My AC unit sounds like a jet taking off. It's unbelievably loud if you're in the bedroom with the intake. The internet is spotty, and can sometimes have really high latency. \n\nLiving here is ... fine. Better than University Village, that's for sure.",

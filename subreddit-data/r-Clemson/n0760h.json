Just weird for a chick fil a but standard for dining halls and such.\n\nIMO, all on campus restaurants and such need to be open later. No reason to shut everything down at 7 other than $$$, but I don't get hungry until ~8pm most days. Probably the number one reason I didn't eat much on campus when I lived there. Worse when everything good is shut down. \n\nClemson wants to not be a suitcase college but fails to supply even food for students on meal plans.",

The bag is about the size of your palm and is red with black accents. The airpod case is burnt orange and is ribbed. The house key is painted black and red with the # 105. Please please please if you have seen them or have them, message me. I will pay to get them back. All I want is my babies back home at the end of the night \ud83d\ude13",

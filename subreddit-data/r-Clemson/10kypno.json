It looks like there is a ton of outdoor activities, which is great but a few things give us pause. We currently live on the east coast in a large city and we love living in the city.  I keep reading people rant about Greenville, but what does Clemson have to offer? What are your favorite things in Clemson? We'd really value input from people who live there.",

            "comment": "As someone who grew up in the area and now lives in a huge east coast city, Clemson is a very small town. Being home to a major university helps drive some arts and entertainment but please note you\u2019re still in rural SC. \n\nThe students definitely help give it an exciting energy, but when school is out, Clemson is very quiet. \n\nThe main perks of living near Clemson are outdoors activities: lakes, mountains, golf, etc. \n\nYou\u2019re almost equidistant between Charlotte and Atlanta which allows you large city access when you need/want it. \n\nHonestly I think that if you\u2019re happy in the city you\u2019ll be very over Clemson in a short time. \nI really think you should visit for a short time before making any decisions. \n\nI\u2019d move back to Clemson to retire but I have no desire to live there in my 30s.",

Quite a lot of development in Clemson the past decade.  It might be unrecognizable.   Here's a list of local spots for entertainment, some of them have changed.  \n\n\n**Clemson Downtown** \\- It's still the same vibe (bars, athletic shops, and college grub) but now with taller buildings and parking garages. Axe throwing is fun. No reason not to walk it again!\r  \n**Botanical Gardens** \\- It's gotten some improvements over the years. Still beautiful.\r  \n**Patrick Square** \\- Newish subdivision with expensive homes and \"built-in\" shops / restaurants. Rick Erwin'$ is here, along with a few other interesting options.\r  \n**Clemson Marina Grill** \\- Would recommend in the summer. Burgers and fries by the lake, staring at the stadium. Quintessential Clemson.\r  \n**Pendleton Square** \\- Pendleton square has grown some. It often has live music. The Blue Heron moved here. 1826 is - IMHO - the best small plate restaurant in Clemson area. You'll also find a few breweries / beer gardens nearby. If morning, don't miss the Village Baker's fresh pastries!\r  \n\r  \nFurther out ...\r  \n**The Silos** \\- In Easley, a new cluster of restaurants that always has live music.\r  \n**Nature** \\- Further out is all of the same hikes and trails: Brasstown, Issaquena falls, Foothills Trails, Tablerock.\r  \n**Greenville** \\- Vastly different than the 80s/90s. It is now gorgeous, bursting with life, and very walkable. Walk the Falls Park bridge. Favorites: The Anchorage and the Trappe Door.\r  \n**Cashiers/Highlands** \\- Get up into the mountains and visit some quaint shoppes. Cashiers has good hikes and kid and dog friendly Whiteside brewery. The Highlands has Thyme restaurant and ice skating! Sapphire Valley ski slope is nearby.\r  \n**Asheville** \\- Definitely has a unique vibe .... and like Greenville, too much too list ... but now we're very far from Clemson. Still worth the drive.\n\n  \nCalling it rural, SC is not true.  Twenty years ago it was a two stoplight town.  But, now it's bustling college town.  You'll find similar in Athens, Asheville, Flagstaff, etc.    It's filled with life, energy, and the progressive thought that comes with having a center of education nearby.  It's by no means sleepy or stagnant.  It is steadily growing with new businesses and buildings each year.   Yes, it's got some population crush when students are here, but honestly that's ONLY when you are within a stones throw of the university.  Everything else (outside of chic-fil-a blvd) is fine.  And during the summer you got all the mid-sized city amenities with none and traffic.  No, you won't find metropilan amentinties like an IKEA here, a Costco, or an international airport.  But, several are within 1.5hr drive in either direction thanks to the Charlotte, Atlanta proximity.  Half that distance (45m) is Greenville (it too has an airport), beautiful walkabout downtown, and a city that gives you all of the large-city amenities and entertainment.",

I think the 17k is full time city residents which may include some students.\n\nFor outdoor recreation, you are close to the southern Appalachian and the national forests. Some nice state parks too (table rock, Jones gap). Think trails, camping, rafting, kayaking, fishing, mountain biking etc. Asheville is about an hour away. Congaree national park about 2 hours away in Columbia. \n\nPeople definitely sail on the lakes, mostly on Keowee. One of my buddies sails regularly on Hartwell though, but I\u2019m not sure where he puts in. The immediate Hartwell area around Clemson has several low bridges, so not great for sailing there.",

I stayed in school for 6 years and by year 5 I was beyond ready to get out. There are \\~25 restaurants and a bunch of college bars, but you'll be surrounded by college students. If you plan to move there for &lt;5 years, I think you'd enjoy it, but I would personally live on Keowee or something with a dock, which would be pretty expensive if you're looking to buy. Hartwell isn't super clean, keowee is much nicer",

In the outskirt student housing (The Pier/The Flats/University Village/etc) there tends to be an spike in crime (from Anderson I was told) when most students leave but I never had issues around downtown/campus/trails/coves.",

Id just move up to Greenville or a suburb of it, you\u2019ll get a lot more amenities and things to do and can still get a smaller town feel. You might say \u201coh but the city of Greenville is only 45 mins away, I can drive that anytime\u201d but when you\u2019re tired and just wanna relax at a quiet bar, you won\u2019t wanna drive that and you won\u2019t find that without leaving clemson.

Sorry, i would just rather be honest in my feelings, especially as someone who moved there from a relatively large city (Raleigh, NC). If you love the city, you will dislike Clemson after six months, easily. There are only two main roads, and the restaurants are all sports bars/fast food.

Tons of amazing hiking trails and waterfall spots, fishing, boating etc. you\u2019re like 4 hours from Charleston and like 90 min from Athens, I think - maybe less. ATL is like 2 hour i believe. I\u2019d move to Clemson on a heartbeat if the money was right. Love to raise my child there. Game days are only like 6 weekends out of the year. Regarding the food, PLENTY of nicer spots in Clemson and then also Anderson. Gville is close with plenty of nice restaurants. In Clemson you have Pixie and Bills, Calhoun corners and I think one of the newer hotel/condos has a great restaurant. There\u2019s a nicer restaurant on Keowee as well.

It\u2019s about an hour away, but definitely worth it for a weekend night jaunt.\n\nFor nature, there\u2019s so much to do! Mountains, lakes, rivers, gorgeous hiking trails and waterfalls. Rafting, kayaking, tubing, boating on the lakes (Keowee and Jocassee are gorgeous).",

As a grad student I have to say I hate living here. It's super boring, there are a good amount of outdoor activities and stuff but coming from NC the hiking and aquatic activities aren't as good. I will say I've had some great conversations with locals at the local bars and small family-owned restaurants.\n\nSouth Carolina in general is an infrastructure hell-scape. Rotting highways and homes everywhere once you get out of the brand new suburbs. Everything is car dependent so expect to see lots and lots of ugly department stores and everything to be surrounded in rotting parking lots. You can walk to things if you literally live on-campus, but even then you spend a lot of time dodging cars to cross the street. Talking to locals who have lived in Clemson their whole lives, things have really changed in the last 10-20 years with a lot of suburbs popping up. It used to be very rural and quite beautiful but now it's all suburban sprawl, a lot of these suburbs don't even have sidewalks because, why would you want to walk somewhere? Expect to spend a lot of time in your car if you want to do anything outside of your house.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you have any more specific/personal questions, I've been here for 2 years.",

If your idea of a great Saturday is hiking up a mountain or around a river to take in a gorgeous view then driving back to town to catch a football game over dinner and beer at a bar, then Clemson might be your dream town.  \n\nGreat lake access, fishing opportunities, camping, and hiking.  I'm partial to Devil's Fork State Park (40 minutes away) for a mix of hiking, fishing, camping, swimming.  Table Rock is a little further from Clemson (50 minutes) but a great hike.  Ravens Cliff Falls and other trails are in Caesar's Head which is just a little further still (about an hour), but all totally manageable for a half-day, day, or weekend trip.  There's also Keowee-Toxaway state park, Oconee Station, Paris Mountain state park, and quite a few others.  \n\nI've lived here 13 years and I still haven't made it to all of them, mostly because we keep going back to places we've already been.\n\nColumbia is also only a couple hours away and there are additional parks, trails, and camp sites available down that way including Congaree National Park, which I enjoyed visiting regularly when I lived down that way.  Columbia is a real interesting city (I think), and a great place to visit.  Plus Riverbanks Zoo is down in Cola... which is hands down my favorite zoo and has been rated a top 10 zoo in the US many times.  You're not specifically asking about Zoos, but it is the thing I miss most about leaving Columbia.\n\nA few more hours still (about 4 - 4.5) and you can make it to Charleston which is a city you should definitely visit at least once.  There is also Edisto Beach state park south of Charleston which is a totally different hiking/camping experience than the mountains, as it is right on the Atlantic coast.",

If you're into golf, tons of that around, disc golf courses as well. A couple of white water rafting companies that go down the Chatooga river. Clemson athletics always has something going on. Seneca has outdoor music on Thursday evening during warm months (Jazz on the Alley) , and Walhalla has a dope Oktoberfest every year. Taxes are low and the people are friendly.....for now. Really good restaurants are few, and you'll have to travel for a decent concert. Still lots of good ole boy types around, and the politics here are far right of center.

We are in our 50s and have raised two kids here.  I love it here but I am not location dependent for happiness.  I have a wonderful friend group and am fairly active.  I jog , hike paddle and boat which Clemson is perfect for.  I am a regular at several local independent restaurants.  The two grocery stores I use are nice well stocked and modern.  I also shop at a local butcher shop and two produce stands.  I am a member at the Episcopal Church and have many friends there.  Some days when I am off work I won't leave my property just doing chores and messing about in my basement shop.  The University adds so much to the small town last night there was a basketball game and a concert at the Brooks center.  I have to work on home football games but enjoy going to other sports.  Going to non-revenue sports is great fun.  My friends and neighbors are great.  The beach and the mountains are close enough for weekend trips.  Closest ski mountain is about three hours away Edisto beach is four hours.  Fishing on Lake Hartwell is great.  Clemson University has a huge forest that is open for all types of recreation like horseback ridding  mountain biking and hiking.  I like history and often day trip to sites within two hours from Clemson.  Lots of little festivals around some with street drinking and live music.  Parking and traffic are my only complaints but if I am in it then I am part of the problem and it is really only bad at peak times.",

I\u2019m not sure if that would be a problem for you but I just thought it\u2019s something you should know. The outdoor opportunities are fantastic around here but most of the areas are hunted heavily. I spend most of my free time outdoors so I think I have a decent enough understanding of the area in case you have any more questions regarding that. Clemson definitely lacks most of the amenities of a big city as well but there are still some hidden gem diners and restaurants that I\u2019ve found. Greenville can fill any gaps but driving 45 minutes and sometimes more one way can get old.\n\nOne final note is that Reddit is generally oriented and used by more left leaning people so you definitely are not getting the entire story here. I\u2019m surprised no one has mentioned how deeply conservative the area is**. Even Greenville votes red in all districts which is pretty unusual for a city.\n Edit: I see now that some others have also mentioned this.",

I've spent years exploring the greater area around Clemson. A vast majority of the nearby hiking spots outlaw hunting, such as the experimental forest, state parks, all of the public land provided by Duke Energy, etc. It's good to be aware of the season, especially in wilderness areas. But it's not a pressing danger or something to be overly concerned about. I've logged literally thousands of miles in the southern Appalachians and can count my direct encounters with hunters on one hand.",

Clemson is a small town with a permanent population of ~ 18k. The population swells during the academic year (+ ~ 30k undergrad/grad) and traffic follows. The perception of \u2018bad traffic\u2019 will likely be relative to your current experience. Clemson has fantastic outdoor opportunities - lots of great hiking/biking/running/boating/swimming opportunities both in-town and in mountains nearby. The town is situated adjacent to Lake Hartwell, which is really fun in the summer. The accessibility of in-town opportunities is a huge benefit, you don\u2019t get that in many cities. The local schools are great and the students typically matriculate to a large breadth of D1 and private institutions. Housing is more expensive after the pandemic, but still affordable in comparison to larger nearby cities (Charlotte, ATL, Greenville). The population of Clemson itself is \u2018relatively\u2019 diverse, due to university influence. Surrounding cities/ towns are less diverse and pretty rural. Clemson is a mix of liberal and conservative; the university influence injects more liberal folks than would be present otherwise. The university is a good place to work and tends to have responsible admin staff (benefit if that\u2019s your line of work). It\u2019s a good town if you like the outdoors, small friend groups, football, and a relatively quiet lifestyle. It really depends on the vibe you\u2019re looking for, where you\u2019re coming from, whether you plan to have kids, etc.",

The college student population is double the year round resident population. The town is pretty much just grocery stores, gas stations, and fast food restaurants. Lots and lots of apartment complexes for student housing. Personally, I'd say the only reason to live in Clemson is if you are involved in the University in some way.",

            "comment": "Mid 40s, with no kids and park of a DINK. I live in Seneca just outside Clemson on the water. Clemson is about three miles from where I live. I grew up in the DC area, attending high school in the city. Came to Clemson for collage and it was a HUGE change. But that was twenty plus years ago. Have moved around since but landed back in the Clemson area. I enjoy living here. I find that there are lots of things to do, but they rarely are in Clemson when students are in session (much prefer Vangeli\u2019s in Seneca for food or keowee brewing for drinks. Or Tyler\u2019s at the pier but that\u2019s more based on proximity). Though wings on Wednesday at backstreets is always a win. \n\nIf you plan on living in Clemson be prepared for lots of students (obviously) and lots of traffic. On game days traffic will be one way into the the stadium before the game and out of the stadium after the game. Do not expect that to change. It won\u2019t. Realize the city is geared for the students (as it should be, there is no city of Clemson without the uni). Patrick square seems to be an area that is geared more for adults (or family) with great food (Rick Erwin\u2019s and Joe\u2019s New York pizza) and what appears to be a good brewery. \n\nThere are tons of hikes around. Lots of water activities if you have a boat. Lots of sports related to Clemson. The adult leagues where in Greenville when I checked but that was a decade ago when I moved back to this area. Plays at brooks center or Greenville. \n\nWe go to Greenville once a month or so now but that\u2019s more for food or the theater at the point. I do have freeness that go weekly. It\u2019s not a bad drive. Otherwise we eat and chill in Seneca typically. \n\nClemson is not a big city, but has a lot of the same problems that big cities have. Think terrible traffic. If you want to live in a downtown area with lots of activities for adults (ie not students) I would suggest Greenville.",

Can be crowded during the school year though, but most of the congestion is right in the heart of Clemson/the university. Congestion doesn't really cause any issues outside Central/Pendleton/Seneca (check a map).",

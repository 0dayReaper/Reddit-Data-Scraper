    "postText": "Long story short, I hate how after like 8pm there's no where to study.\n\nLibrary closes at 10 until after spring break, ASC closes at 10, Hendrix closes at 11.\n\nSo what do you do? You try and find a classroom to study in. But be sure to be there before 10 or else you cant get in the building. Better yet, once you're in, after like 9pm you can't scan into any classrooms. If you're already in a classroom, you can't leave it because you can't get back in.\n\nToday, I was studying in a classroom. Got there at like 8. Went to the bathroom, came back, couldn't get back in. This is a classroom I literally have a class in. I had to call CUPD to let me back in to get my stuff. Cop was super cool, but basically told me you're not allowed to be in the room after business hours. Alright cool, I'll go to the library. Headed over to the library and the lady at the front desk tells me I got 5 minutes until they close. Its 9:55pm. I walk over to the ASC, can't even get in the building because at this point it's 10:01.\n\nI mean this is ridiculous. You can't even study in your department's building after they close. I don't understand what the big deal is. I mean I get it's a security thing, but if that's the case then there needs to be dedicated 24/7 spots/entire buildings.",

            "comment": "Cooper Library *is* supposed to be the solution to late-night studying. It just sucks that the burst pipe damage is affecting their operations so hard. \n\nVickery Hall 1st floor would definitely be worth checking out in the meantime. They have study areas that you usually have to reserve, but from 9PM - 2AM they're open to everyone. \n\nAlso the Kinard Hall ground floor entrance (by the parking lot near Strode Tower) is open 24/7. Not sure what the auditorium access is like there after hours though.\n\nYou can check out [this link](https://libraries.clemson.edu/seats/campus-study-spaces/) for some other ideas.",

I usually just give up and go home early which is never good in the end. \n\nThey really do need to do something about it. I\u2019ll have to try vickery hall like the other user commented. \n\nAlso, idk if it\u2019s a glitch in the system but according to the asc study room reservation they\u2019re now open until 2 am? Bc it\u2019s allowing you to reserve rooms until 2 am but I just noticed this today so I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a glitch or not.",

I graduated in 2013 and the only places and times I ever got any work done was ridiculously late at night on campus. I waited tables until 10pm most nights and I struggled to ignore distractions at my apartment, so I'd always be on campus until like at least 3am. \n\nUsually, I'd be in Cooper as it was open 247, but I had two engineering buddies that would study together in one of the Mac rooms in Riggs (the room required a key code to enter but anyone in electrical engineering knew what it was) and we'd stay there all night literally shooting the shit and studying. It was a well known fact that grad students would prop one of the side doors open and you could pretty much always get into that building any time of day.\n\nNot sure I'd have finished my degree with how things are now... \ud83e\udd23 Biochem 305 and/or Organic Chem almost certainly would have been my downfall without those late night study sessions on campus.",

The link above is a link from the ASC webpage.\n\nI somewhat agree with why the buildings are locked outside of normal class time, however with all the new scanners across campus, I believe it would be very hard to get away with theft.\n\nThink about it, you have to scan into every building in addition to having to scan into certain classrooms in some buildings. I know with certain buildings such as Watt or Cooper, they use the scanning to see who has been in and out of the building, and who still remains inside. I'm sure CCIT has a log of every location you've ever scanned in. Using this in addition to security cameras, I think it would be pretty easy to backtrack missing items due to theft.",

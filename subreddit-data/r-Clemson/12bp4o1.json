    "postText": "Hi guys, I\u2019m taking a 1 semester 5th year in the fall before I graduate. I am only going to have 9 credit hours, which qualifies me as a part time student. I saw online that in order to get the student football tickets you must have 12 hours. Is this a requirement for the lottery tickets, or for the paid student season tickets, or both. \n\nIf anyone has any experience with this or knows any more please let me know. I\u2019m willing to pickup some easy 3 hour online class but I\u2019d rather not. \nThanks!",

You are guaranteed a seat, although it won't be in the student section and doesn't include parking until you donate at the Orange level. Compare that with paying an extra $1650+ (for in-state) or even more for out-of-state to become a full-time student.\n\nIf you want to go that route, you do have to take care of it NOW because season tickets are allocated in April.",

Had to have paid half by then, but that doesn\u2019t mean one shouldn\u2019t try to purchase a ticket still via IPTAY. Clemson (especially athletics) is always willing to take money. I would think just purchasing a season ticket after market in august might be just as easy.",

Just have 12 hours signed up when requesting and once the deadlines passed, you should be all clear to just drop the extra 3 hours. You won\u2019t have to pay for it as long as you drop it before the tuition deadline/before paying the tuition bill.",

    "postText": "Hey everybody. I was wondering if there was anyone that has taken ECE 3300 over the summer at a different institution. The prof (Baum) who is teaching it over the summer and next semester has some of the worst RateMyProfessor reviews i\u2019ve seen. They go so far to call him the anti-christ haha. That mixed the fact it is an 8am has me scrambling to find a summer option. Thanks for the help!",

            "comment": "I took it 8am with Baum during a semester in 2021. I would describe that class as a active sport rather than a class. You don\u2019t learn much due to the overload of work. You just get the work done without spending time to learn the material. Too many exams and assignments. It\u2019s such a fundamental class in ECE/CE as well which is super disappointing that this is the experience. If you can, try doing the summer option at Clemson or the honors route. I don\u2019t think your able to take this class at another institution due to the departments strict guidelines for graduation.",

However, it is a Baum class and you might need multiple long nights after coming home from work. It\u2019s possible, just depends on motivation. (Keep in mind I didn\u2019t take ECE 3300 online over the summer, this is based on what i\u2019ve heard).",

I found it easy to study since he pretty much gives you everything you need and you don't have to look for outside sources. If you are really good at math, you can take it anytime and be alright, because he really does make studying convenient to do.\n\nHowever, if you don't actually do all the problems on the study guides he releases you will not do well because his tests are created to take the full time. If you don't know it well you won't have time to figure it out during the test.\n\nSo I think just take it, and make sure you can do every problem pretty fast on the study guide before the test. Try your best to not procrastinate! Good luck :)",

I (think) it\u2019s online if you take it over the summer but it\u2019s also accelerated pacing that makes the speed of the class worse. Electronics I is pretty reasonable online and Hubbard typically only has two tests and the final as work if you do want to take a summer class.",

On one hand doing during a summer semester may make your life easier given some of the other classes occurring around that semester, on the other your summer will suck. Kinda a lose lose, but may be good to get it over with when you can where it doesn\u2019t impact your other classes",

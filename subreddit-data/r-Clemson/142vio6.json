Any advice for getting through the group reports? In lecture i\u2019m fine, the instructor is great, it\u2019s just this horrible lab.",

She (at least when I had her) really wants you to succeed if you make it apparent that you are putting in the work and want to understand the material. Lab reports are the hardest part of lab, so you might have to j grind that shit out and take the L if you don\u2019t trust your group\u2019s contributions while roasting them in the peer review \n\nChem lab is hard, but it\u2019s not impossible. You got this homeslice",

My TA for chem lab did not speak English that well and unfortunately, that\u2019s the case for most of the TA\u2019s for that department. With that being said, I will admit who you get paired with for chem lab does slightly affect your performance. I was lucky in the sense I got good group members who were fairly knowledgeable and were good with doing their fair share of work for lab and reports. Although, I had a friend who had a similar case as you and didn\u2019t get a good group for chem lab, so his grade suffered a little. Only advice I can give is to contact your TA and see if you can get moved to a different group or voice your concern on your situation. If they know you\u2019re putting in most of the work, I doubt they will heavily penalize you for that. Also, chem lab only makes up a small portion of your overall grade, so I wouldn\u2019t let it get to you that much. If you don\u2019t mind me asking, who is your TA?",

However, as mentioned above, I would start emailing them one by one about your situation and see what they say. I\u2019m sure they will try to help you if they can. That\u2019s all I can recommend, sorry I can\u2019t be of any further help",

    "postText": "About a mile walk from campus. Thinking of doing Airbnb for football season and student semester rental for the spring. Far from working out the exact details, but I was curious of the sub\u2019s thoughts\u2026 \n\n\u2014 If you\u2019re a Clemson fan/parent, are airbnbs something in the area that you\u2019re looking for during for football game day weekends? Or are there any other times you\u2019d want to stay at an Airbnb that close to campus?\n\n\u2014 Students, how do you feel about a January-June-ish lease?\n\n\u2014 Give me any thoughts. Is buying a condo in Clemson a good idea? Tell me to fuck myself. Any advice is welcomed",

            "comment": "So I\u2019m a previous student and current fan. \n\n1) I only stay in airbnbs when I go to Clemson or Greenville (I visit both for different things) because I have pets. However, the hotel options have gotten a lot better in the past few years and Airbnb has really started to suck. \nPeople visit Clemson for other sports and events. Graduate is a huge time (both December and may) also people visit for orientations. Or to see campus. So I think people do visit pretty often. \n\n2) that leasing time may be really really really hard to find students. Most people are looking for places that have summer start and end. Like I\u2019m going back as a graduate student and my lease starts in July. You also are going to limit your pool of applicants because some people don\u2019t want to move out lol. You\u2019re really only going to find people who are graduating in December or had like a study abroad thing. \n\n\nI don\u2019t have advice other than that though!",

            "comment": "I would love to discuss whether you would consider leasing this fall to a responsible male Mech-E student who graduates in December. He needs a parking spot and a space to move his belongings when his current lease is up (I think sometime in June?) \n\nThere are always males looking for fall '23 lease options, fyi, due to co-op rotation assignments or study abroad or transferring, etc. (For some reason most of the fall '23 sublet options advertised seem to all be female students so the few spaces for male sublets get snapped up.). Spring leases seem to be a dime a dozen for the above fall-semester demand reasons.\n\nIn general, I do think buying a condo in Clemson could be a decent investment if your condo is a comfortable walking distance to campus. If you have parking, you could even likely rent your parking space for games.\n\nBut, seriously, let me know if you have a condo to let soon.  \n\nGood luck to you!",

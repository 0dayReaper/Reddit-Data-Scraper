I've seen the effects of way too many horrible accidents.  Long story short-- my dad was in law enforcement.  When I was in elementary school, he transferred to the alcohol control division.  When students were killed in accidents involving alcohol (including a few involving trains that happened on the train tracks that cross the lake), the parents would stay at our house if they were from out of town.  My parents volunteered to do that instead of them staying in a hotel.  It was heartbreaking.\n\nI'm all for having fun and enjoying student life while not making poor choices.  I'm not a stick-in-the-mud like I appear here.",

It\u2019s an automatic dui if you decline, but there isn\u2019t conclusive evidence of what he could have been under. \n\nI imagine he probably was on something, but it\u2019s unfortunate that it reads that the day was dark and the man kind of walked out in front of the truck. Just a shitty situation for both the driver and the deceased. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a non victim in this scenario.",

SC is an implied consent state \u2013 if you're driving on the road, you must consent to field sobriety, etc., so his refusal will be used as evidence against him.",

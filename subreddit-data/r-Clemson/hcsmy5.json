I can't wait to get tested for antibodies to see if I had it yet. \n\nAt some point you have to open. And when you do you're going to have spikes.

And that they died alone and afraid makes it worse. God bless you for helping.\n\nHowever the overwhelming numbers are of milder cases where people recover. This is a fact. From all reports, including anecdotal ones from friends who are doctors and nurses employed by NYC &amp; NJ hospitals, the overwhelming number of people who succumbed to COVID had severe comorbidities. \n\nDeath, and moving on is a part of life. This generation seems to have a very hard time accepting that. A spike is not necessarily a bad thing. We need to keep our eyes on hospitalizations &amp; deaths. God willing, this too will pass.",

    "postText": "This is my first summer staying here, got a couple questions (it basically just boils down to asking if places are open)\n1. I'm assuming dining halls are closed or limited hours, is that right? And if they are open, do the current meal swipes carry to the summer?\n2. Is anywhere that takes paw points still open for the summer?\n3. Is fike still open? I will be working for a research project over summer so I'm guessing I can still scan into places\n4. Anything you'd recommend doing while it's quiet in the summer? I'm only 20 so no dt but other stuff",

            "comment": "I stayed last summer and the dining halls have very limited hours, most of the time only core was open. It also depended on what summer camps were happening when and where. I know core starbucks was open so I assume they would take paw points but again very limited hours. Fike is open but you have to buy a summer pass that is not included in your regular tuition. There\u2019s a lot to do within the communities out side of Clemson. A good way to find events is on the facebook pages for other towns/cities. Central and Greenville also have weekly farmers markets in the spring/summer",

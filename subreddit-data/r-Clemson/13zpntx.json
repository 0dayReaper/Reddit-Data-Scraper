However, when reading the application form I got to the section to list these and fell short.   \n\n\nI'm entirely unsure of where to start. Are there places to try to get these at Clemson? Are there other routes like scholarly online groups for membership?",

As for the memberships just join any club, there\u2019s a good website for it although I don\u2019t remember what is right now, it\u2019s Clemson specific and should just be a giant list with current president emails to inquire about membership. Just join anything that you\u2019re interested in whether it\u2019s academically related or like kayaking club. Might be able to get elected to an officer position in one year although maybe don\u2019t shoot for president since you\u2019ll have only been in a year",

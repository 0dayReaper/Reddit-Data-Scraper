Even if it would save a little bit of money on electricity costs (which are actually pretty minimal for LED and other modern light sources), the installation and management of a system to turn them on/off, or paying someone to turn them on/off would probably cost more (or break even) versus just leaving them on.\n\nHeck, 20 years ago my mom's boss did the math on turning fluorescent tubes on and off. The act of turning on a fluorescent tube consumed as much energy as just leaving it running for an hour. The technology has only gotten more efficient since then.\n\nLike...of all the things to get mad at the administration about...leaving the light on in the library ticks you off?",

This inrush of current can be many times greater than the normal operating current of the lamp. However, the spike of current draw normally lasts no longer than 1/10th of a second, and draws the equivalent of about 5 seconds of normal operation. So, if you turn your fluorescent lamp off and on more frequently than every 5 seconds, you will use more power than normal. So, normal switching of fluorescent lamps has very, very, very little effect on a power bill.\n\nhttps://www.lightingdesignlab.com/resources/articles/articles-lighting-fundamentals/should-i-turn-fluorescent-lights-when-leaving-room",

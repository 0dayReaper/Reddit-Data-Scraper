So as a follow up, if I apply now and they pull my high school results, which were strong, do my current college results factor in for a quick decision or do I need to wait until final grades are in?  I appreciate the opportunity to ask these questions of you.",

I applied as a transfer, but they required that I send my high school transcripts and stuff as well...basically told me I needed freshman application credentials just because I had fewer college credits. I would still call like you mentioned but hopefully they will tell you something similar! I applied around this time of year in 2018 and knew by Feb 2019 :)",

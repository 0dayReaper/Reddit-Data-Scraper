Who the hell thought it was a good idea to close THREE lots at the same time? I drive past a damn cow field going to class yet my friends at USC have an easier time parking. It's outrageous. Parking services and whoever else is behind these decisions has really poor planning. It's time students organize and do something about this. Idk what, but this can't continue.",

Take a look at this: [https://cufacilities.sites.clemson.edu/documents/planning/LRFP\\_lowres.pdf](https://cufacilities.sites.clemson.edu/documents/planning/LRFP_lowres.pdf)\n\nIt outlines their plans for campus over the coming years. They want to make buses the main mode of transportation. They also want more \"greenspace\" which I see as them favoring IPTAY donors over current and future students.",

No they do not need to cover the whole campus in parking lots they could  make a parking garage that would do a pretty good job at solving this problem. I'm not against buses, but there needs to be some major improvements for them to be viable for commuting students.",

Clemson administration is far removed from how their actions affect students in this regard; she stated firmly we would never build a parking garage and claimed that Clemson only sells parking passes in sustainable numbers. They really only have interest in their own projects and don't care about the closure of three lots, unfortunately. Still, please absolutely do bother parking services and administration as much as possible!! Change has to happen eventually.",

Get the news involved and call them out for choosing money over students, that might get them moving. But someone needs to come up with a good case. Plenty of students will back it but there needs to be hard evidence, not word of mouth or speculation. Proof were getting screwed and not just \"no parking because of construction\".",

I would look into them before getting one.\n\nCan't charge them on campus, can't take them into buildings, have to treat them like bikes (meaning stay off the \"walk-only\" sidewalks and park them in bike racks).\n\nOthers have mentioned they get snatched (either by thieves or those who have a strong distaste for scooters), even the ones that have immobilization software that makes them useless for anyone.\n\nSave yourself the hassle and ride the CAT or get a cheap bike. (Couple other posts over the years of expensive bikes getting stolen). If you want more speed, look at a cheap moped (but good luck with parking, moped riders seem to park 3 to a space nowadays).\n\nShort of a commercial e-scooter vendor, private scooters get a lot of hate on campus.",

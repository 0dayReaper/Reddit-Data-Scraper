    "postText": "Ever since COVID the administration refuses to open buildings back to the public. The excuse has been \"Oh but safety\", mass shooters target places where people are. Cooper library has people going in and out all hours, and odds are the shooter will be a student.\n\n \"Oh but our precious valuable equipment!\" Virtually everything in the library isn't worth stealing. Yes really. The computers are ancient, and they're chained to the desk which is bolted to the floor. Thinking someone is going to go into a packed library, covered in cameras with bolt cutters is insanity. (How would they even escape anyway?). Enforcing these arbitrary rules causes them to pay 2 people to sit around and do nothing all day making sure no one sneaks into a library, that was open to the public for 150 years prior with zero incident. I couldn't find any news stories of anything being stolen, ever (Because it's a stupid idea). Assuming they're paid ~18$/hr that's 100k going to this for zero reason. \n\n\"But the most common crime at Clemson is theft!\". Yeah the theft of STUDENT belongings. Mostly over break. Because students are likely to have left their fancy electronics (Like MacBooks, PS5s etc.), and have cash.\n\nThere are even worse examples, they close Martin Hall completely and lock every door... Because someone might steal a desk? Are they worried about the projector that is a decade old and worthless? As a student this makes my life worse because it's harder to find study places outside \"normal\" hours.\nOh, also, some buildings ARE open 24/7 but only for certain students. McAdams is open 24/7 if you're a CS major because I guess it's more likely for a non-cs major to scan in with their real ID to steal _worthless_ computer hardware. (As in the newest desktops in McAdams are from ~2017. i5-7500s iirc)\n\ntldr: \nClemson keeps COVID era restrictions for zero reason, and imposes security theater costing money.\np.s: Most of MITs buildings are open to the public, and MITs library is open to the general public (And doesn't require a access card like Clemson does, and also has the first floor open 24/7).\nhttps://now.mit.edu/policies/campus-access-and-visitors/",

It used to not be there and yeah it used to be public during the day, they still made you scan at night. As far as the other halls, security has always locked them at night but not all the doors, you can usually get in somehow since there\u2019s clubs and stuff that meet there at night as long as it\u2019s not too late. Or just chill in the building before the doors lock they won\u2019t kick you out. Like you said their security theater is a joke, the people that lock the doors are students and the actual cops don\u2019t actually care that much",

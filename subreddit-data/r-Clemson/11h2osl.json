I am looking for people currently at or who have graduated from the business school at Clemson as I have a few questions. Is the business school well respected in the area? Are the opportunities for internships, jobs, etc. good during and after school? Is it worth it to go to Clemson over a \u201cmore prestigious\u201d name in the business world because I like the school so much?",

If you\u2019re looking to be a broker up in NYC I\u2019d go to an Ivy. \n\nI\u2019ve yet to find an accounting major who didn\u2019t have a good job lined up. \n\nCollege is what you make of it. Clemson isn\u2019t gonna just be a name that puts you at the top of every job list or every internship  but it\u2019s never gonna hold you back. \n\nWe\u2019ve got great connections to companies but you\u2019ve got to go out and make the most of those connections. Go out and get internships and work experiences go to the career center to do interviews and resume building etc.",

Accountants learn the same thing everywhere, and are interested in ROI. \n\nIf you want to be in finance in NYC, Villanova or Northeastern.\n\nIf you want to be in finance in Charlotte, the Capitol of the South,  go to Clemson.",

How do students feel about Clemson's future vision of adding more green spaces and more pedestrian walkways over parking garages? How has this problem made things worse with the increasing number of freshman classes and not enough infrastructure?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/12ud29f)",

            "comment": "I mean I feel like wanting a walkable campus and more parking are not mutually exclusive. The issue is we need a way to get to campus. Unless Clemson feels like investing in trains to get people around from off to on campus the busses aren\u2019t comparable to driving. They take 2-4 times longer to get to campus and with a car I can leave anytime I want. If you want the middle of campus to be walkable I agree that sounds nice but busses are not a viable solution for everyone to get to campus imo. The best solution would be to try and remove some of the roads cutting through campus, increase the amount of road going around campus and add additional parking on the outside of campus. This would also help alleviate some of the traffic in the area hopefully if everyone isn\u2019t going on one or two roads.",

                    "comment": " The parking situation at Clemson can be broken down into 3 groups of people:\n\n1. Parking is bad because I can't personally find a space when I want one.\n2. Parking is bad, so I want to be able to ride a bus straight to campus when I want to.\n3. I don't want to leave my apartment at 7:15 to find a parking space on campus so I can walk to my first class at 8:00 a.m. (I hate the Catbus)\n\nI have been in all three groups at one point or another and complained that the lack of close parking makes me late to class and stressed. So I listened when USG/UGSG complains and the administration comes and walks through their logic. Yes, parking services sells more permits than there are students. Parking Services has repeatedly reported that parking spot utilization peaks at 90% and fluctuates lower during the day.\n\nThere are tons of spots in the remote lots that goes empty so adding additional parking on the outside of campus is a nonstarter. Likewise, the prospective spots for a garage are just as far from campus: Kite Hill, R-4 Extension, or next to C-1, lots that rely on CATBus \\[I almost never see anyone walking in from them), that is underutilized, but runs every 15 minutes.\n\nThe problem is people driving straight to C-2, C-12 and C-11 between 7:55 and 9:00 a.m. (MWF) thinking there would be a spot while C-14, C-1, C-16 and the P lots are way underutilized.\n\nParking Services has worked to try to get Catbus down to 10 minutes. They are making Perimeter Road 4 lanes, but adding a garage, if it ever happens is a complete waste of money unless they build it on top of C-2 or C-11, which will fill up just as fast and you will still have people complaining it takes 10 minutes to get out of the garage.\n\nJust take a look at any major metro with public transportation. The buses are packed, the trains are packed, the garages are expensive yet packed and still people complain about lack of on-street parking near where they want to go.\n\nI am not opposed to a parking structure(s), but I am under no illusion that one will even remotely put a dent in the parking complaints. It will end up with the university saying, \"we built a garage, what more do you want?\" to which we will say, \"build another one\" and wonder why tuition keeps increasing.",

I personally have taken the park n ride because it's the cheaper option but I understand most students don't want to take the bus to class and prefer to drive. Since you don't think garages or more spots would fix the problem and complaints is there a different solution that you think would work better?",

If we have excess spots during peak times, why would the University spend money to add more?\n\nIf I had to, I would address the core issue they have, which is not enough parking close to academic buildings so they don't have to walk far to campus from where they started. My ideas would make commuting less of an attractive option comparatively. More on campus housing. More cheaper on campus housing. No parking permits for first years. \n\nI agree our external bus routes need some work, but adding lines or buses is way cheaper than building a garage and better than turning green space into asphalt (even though green space doesn't generate revenue).",

If you want the campus to be truly walkable just keep more kids on campus vs shuffling everyone off campus after freshman year. Imagine a few more 1,000 kids living on campus would help a ton. \n\nI\u2019m also with you that maybe in the short term you put a ban on freshmen having cars, but they don\u2019t want to lose the revenue. If you did this though it would by the school time until they can come to terms with a longer term fix. \n\nThe bigger issue Clemson keeps adding more and more kids without the infrastructure in place for everyone. So there isn\u2019t enough housing, there isn\u2019t enough parking, kids can\u2019t get the classes they need, existing infrastructure like say Fike is jammmed etc etc \u2026",

A major issue is that there isn\u2019t any parking closer to the heart of campus. And if there is, it\u2019s metered or for service vehicles. I used to work at the URC on campus and parking to get to work was a nightmare. On game or event days it was hell on earth trying to get to work",

            "comment": "The biggest issue is the idea of parking garages. I\u2019ve gotten a sample and most people would be fine with a small hike in the prices but that won\u2019t be the case.\n\nClemson follows a similar price rate that USC charges and if it is accurate, we\u2019d pay $400 a semester for parking in the garages. That\u2019s a bit more than most students can afford and close to some people\u2019s monthly rent. There\u2019s got to be a better option than telling us to just walk our asses off or car-pool. Most majors class times don\u2019t line up remotely close so it\u2019s not a viable option. I just don\u2019t feel like the current admin running our Uni really care about us. Clements puts on a big front hyping up the programs but for most of them, they are on the decline. \n\nI think parking is a major problem but hell, we might want to focus on getting professors who give a damn and updating the programs to modern times first. The CIS/Comp Sci program is like a dinosaur living in the early 2000\u2019s for the most part. Until we get to Junior and Senior stats I\u2019m hearing about programming methods from when my professors started learning about what coding is and how they did it way back then.",

            "comment": "Adding more lanes and spots will only encourage and induce more car use and will make the problem even worse in the long term.   It may improve the situation in the short term, but it will be worse than it is now eventually. \n\nGreatly increasing bus ridership should be the top priority.  The only way to accomplish this is to make the bus the obviously better and faster option.  Improving bus times by adding express routes and dedicated bus lanes could help improve ridership.  An express route on 93 would be my first thought. Its a straight line with many apartments. The last time I road that route it was terribly inefficient stopping at Ingles twice and doubling back off 93 a couple times to make pickups at non ideal locations. Trains are of the question unless you want to ride amtrack..\n\n\nA revamped carpool system could also help slow the increasing rate of cars coming to campus everyday.  20k+ students driving alone their own car and all parking a 10 min walk from class is impossible.  Doing this with bus service is possible since the bus can drop off in the middle of campus. Its sad what they've done to perimeter rd. It looks like large swaths campus will just be parking lot by decades end..\n\nWalking and biking is largely unfeasible except for Campus and downtown areas.  Long stroads/ bridges separating off campus housing, a hot humid climate and hilly terrain are mostly to blame.  \n\nImproved public transit and park and ride is the only long term answer.  Parking garages would be a disaster financially and traffic wise.",

That\u2019s another option as then kids don\u2019t have to use anything to get to class or can just take the on campus bus system vs the busses that go off to the off campus housing.\n\nThey could also cap enrollment instead of adding more kids each year.",

I also never understood why so many freshman and campus residents were allowed to park cars on campus when the car just sits and takes up a valuable spot 99% of the time.  They should park and ride further away instead.",

Would you rather see a new parking garage with 50 spaces, or a new parking lot with 500-1000 spaces?  They would cost about the same....",

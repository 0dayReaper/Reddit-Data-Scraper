    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am visiting a friend in Duncan. He has never been to a football game and Id love to see the Tigers play. So I am trying to see the best way to get there. I read about parking lots and traffic. How is the public transportation?\n\nI went to other football games previously and normally would park in residential areas before walking to campus and taking a bus to the stadium. Ive done this for Rutgers, Wake Forest, UNC and Temple in the past. \n\nAny tips of what to do/what not to do would be helpful. I plan to be down there for the game against Syracuse!",

            "comment": "Clemson and Clemson University was built for \\~40K people mostly walking around. Gameday population spikes to &gt;100K sometimes estimates peg attendance including tailgates and stadium at over 200K. The roads clog and pedestrian traffic slows everything way down. Police departments from 6 different municipalities (and state highway patrol) are on hand to keep it orderly, but bring your patience.\n\nThere is no \\*reliable\\* public transportation (short of ADA and $donor$ shuttles) into Clemson on the day of the game. Residential areas in walking distance of the stadium will be whoring out thier parking spaces, and sometimes yard space, for a price ($20-$50). The downside is while you are driving around slowly hunting for space there will be about 80,000 people behind you doing the same thing and patience gets real short beginning 2.5 hours before kickoff.\n\nYour options, in order of likelihood of success:\n\nOption 1: buy a parking permit for a designated place on campus ahead of the game (presumably when you buy your tickets from the Clemson University ticket office)\n\nOption 2: drive in on the day of the game and drive around looking for paid parking (P8 or residential)\n\nOption 3: find a public lot in Clemson and walk in (retail). You will average over a mile of walking distance from any place they will not tow your car.\n\nOption 4: drive in and park in any empty space big enough for your vehicle. After the game, proceed directly to 115 Carson Rd, Seneca, SC 29678, where (Death Valley Towing) will have conveniently relocated your vehicle for you.\n\nTips: \n\nmemorize the gameday parking map and print it out. Drive the route to your parking spot on Friday after traffic dies down so you familiarize yourself with the route. \n\nIf you arrive early and stay the whole time, drink plenty of water. Walking around campus is deceptive and it gets warm.\n\nDont bring a bag into the stadium. Be friendly, don't be rude to anyone. Have Fun. Don't get so drunk you find out Clemson University has an actual police department and holding cells.\n\nPrepare for a long trip out if you stay past the begining of the 4th quarter (takes over an hour to get off campus).\n\nAll that to say, attending a big home game at Clemson is absolutly worth it. Some of the best fans in the sport (we do have our edge cases though). Some of the best experiences I have ever had at a competitive sports event.",

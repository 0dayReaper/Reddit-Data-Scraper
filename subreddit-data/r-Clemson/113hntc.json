I want to get a driver's license, I have a license from my home country and an international driver's license. \n\nSomebody suggested me to give the learning's and driver's test together. I do not have a car right now and I cannot rent a car as well because I do not have a license, what is the best way to go about it?",

Alternatively, you can book a lesson with a local driving school and take the test with them after the lesson. That's what I did. Once you pass the test they'll give you the result in a sealed envelope which you have to take back to DMV to get your license.",

I only had a driver's license from my home country but not an international one. \n\nI went to the Seneca DMV next day just before they opened. I had already given my knowledge test (which lasts for six months), so I asked for the skill test, and that's it. Three weeks later, I received my DL via post. You can take both tests without an appointment if you are one of the first five people when the DMV opens.\n\nAnother way is what Sacrilego\\_666 suggested.",

Make sure the rental's tags and insurance are valid and up to date.",

Clemsons so small it\u2019s all I need. I order groceries with Walmart delivery. All you have to do is spend more than $35 very easy to do in today\u2019s world",

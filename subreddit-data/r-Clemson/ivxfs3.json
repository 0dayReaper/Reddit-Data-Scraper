Tiger Band member, band officer, and sit on the board of several alumni groups.\n\nNot a coot, just someone who was around before Clements and has seen the awful things he and Dan Radakovich have done to Clemson.\n\nBTW, did you know when Dan Radakovich was hired, his first act as AD was an attempt to disband Tiger Band and get rid of the alma mater and Tiger Rag?",

Maybe it would be better in the opposite direction? The traffic through Easley or on i85 both suck. alot of grad students and young, non students tend to love   at heritage hills ( i think thats the name) and its pretty close to central and pendleton which both have the tiniest of downtowns, but theyre cute nonetheless",

Greenville is where you want to do the late 20\u2019s stuff. But it is expensive. As another commenter said, Easley is a good halfway point. But there\u2019s Central, there\u2019s Anderson (right on 85), there\u2019s Six Mile, Pelzer, etc.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to get a teaching job then somewhere closer to Clemson would be best. 8am\u2019s are s thing of course. Unless you\u2019re a morning person. It\u2019s about a 45 minute drive to Greenville so it\u2019s not too bad either way.",

            "comment": "I'm full-time at Clemson. I live in Easley as a 'mid-point' between Clemson and Greenville. I did this to keep the commute relatively good both places (about 20-25 minutes to campus, 15-20 to Greenville). Clemson is very undergraduate-driven as a college town so it helps having access to Greenville amenities. Easley itself is slower, since it's mostly a small town with few different restaurants/shops off of 123, but I do splitting the distance.\n\nI'm in my late 20s and would say most people my wife and Is age probably hang out in Greenville mostly, think places like downtown, Gather GVL. Many of my coworkers live fully in Greenville and commute to Clemson daily (either driving themselves or taking a CAT bus). I wasn't a fan of the longer commute but many people do it and are employed at Clemson for years, so your mileage may vary.\n\nCost of living is definitely cheaper than DC suburbs, but is going up as we go. My Easley apartment is approximately $1250 for a sizable one bedroom, up from about 1050 in late 2020.. Happy to answer any questions you have - not sure if your job is similar to mine, but I work as an academic advisor on-campus so happy to answer workplace questions if you need!",

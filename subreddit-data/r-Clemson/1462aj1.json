    "postText": "DISCLOSURE:  I'm putting up this post with the SOLE purpose of making my neighbors aware of vandalism that has been happening in our neighborhood (Charleston &amp; Lawrence) over the past few weeks, and what has/is being done about \n\nHaving said that, please read on:\n\n1.  My son's car was broken into.\n\n2.  Tires on my car were flattened. \n\n3.  Window visor was ripped off my car.\n\n4.  Neighbor's car was spray painted (see pic).\n\n5.  Neighbor's tire was flattened.\n\n6.  $50K of vandalism done to construction equipment on construction site on Lawrence. \n\n7.  Mail boxes were vandalized (see pic).\n\nWe know who the perpetrators are. \n\nClemson City Police says they know who the perpetrators are, but won't do anything unless they're \"caught in the act.\"\n\nPolice reports have been filed for each incident.\n\nClemson Post Office said they will not deliver mail if mail boxes are vandalized in any way.  The mail box clusters are NOT their property, however, so the responsibility of making sure they're upright and functional so the mail carrier can open the back panel to insert mail falls upon the owner of the boxes.  \n\nProbably the owner of the development, \nbut since no-one seems to know who that is, the responsibility falls on individual owners or renters.\n\nIF anyone besides the mail carrier tries to pry open the back panel to take out mail, that is a Federal charge.  Again, the perpetrator(s) would have to be \"caught in the act,\" for CPD to do anything \ud83d\ude44\n\nThe perpetrators know exactly how to get a way with what they're doing.  But this NEEDS.TO.STOP.!\n\nIf anyone else has issues with vandalism, please report it right away and file a police report. \n\nI plan to go to the Police Station today and try to speak with the person in charge face-to-face.  I will request that a patrol car drives through  Charleston and Lawrence on the regular.   If I'm not satisfied with CPDs response to all of this, I may have to do what I was advised to do and contact the Media.",

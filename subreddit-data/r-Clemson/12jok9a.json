    "postText": "Wondering if anyone has been able to take an online course during a co-op rotation? My company is totally cool with it and we have at least 1 student from Georgia Tech at my company every semester that is taking at least 1 class while working and have no issues. I cannot find any specific rules regarding this in the co-op documentation. Am I missing something? I registered for co-op course AND the class I want this summer and iRoar let me register with no issues, so I assume I'm good to go? Thanks in advance.",

I would recommend you talk with the co-op office for specifics on how to go about taking classes while on rotation.",

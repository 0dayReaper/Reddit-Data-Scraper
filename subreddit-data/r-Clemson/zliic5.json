    "postText": "I\u2019m a lesbian at Clemson University. I\u2019m not as social as other people and mostly keep to my small friend group. I\u2019ve always wanted to date when I got to college and to find my own special person but I\u2019ve been shy about it and don\u2019t know how to find the right girl. Does anyone know how to find queer people around campus who are also looking for someone without making it seem too obvious?\n\nAlso just having a lgbtq friend group would help me a lot, even if I don\u2019t necessarily find someone to date. I have been to some of the lgbtq events and talked to some people but it seems as if everyone is already in a relationship/friend group and is uninterested in making more friends.",

As for friends, I definitely recommend keep trying. College is weird. Put yourself out there, join some clubs that are pretty active. People make it out that friendship is easy but it's ridiculously hard. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf08 Message me if you want any specific club reccomendations I know a lot of great groups who are super welcoming!",

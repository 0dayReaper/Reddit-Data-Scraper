            "comment": "I love Clemson with all my heart. They\u2019ve been great to me. \n\nAnd I\u2019ll say with the new business building and new classes and minors they\u2019re adding for business (construction management, also offering a class teaching students SAP which is fucking invaluable. Seriously if anyone else reads this TAKE THE SAP CLASS!! I wish I could\u2019v had the chance .) \n\nI guess if you\u2019re coming from a small northern state (Vermont Maine RI) I\u2019d say Clemson is different enough of an experience to warrant a big look. \n\nBut if you\u2019re from a southern or mid west state that has P5 athletics. I\u2019d say stay in state  if financial aid isn\u2019t good here. \n\nIf money is about equal I\u2019d strongly argue Clemson is starting to be a differentiator when it comes to the business school. I\u2019m impressed with the changes and the building. We\u2019ve got great career services IF YOU USE THEM GO TO THE CAREER CENTER. If you want to live in Greenville, Charlotte Atlanta and the greater south Clemson has a great reputation. We\u2019ve got great ties to some big time companies down here like Michelin BMW \n\nBut overall we\u2019re not an IVY or a Duke/Vandy or a super prestigious public like UVA. \n\nBut I\u2019d argue strongly were starting to punch high when it comes to being a big southern state school. I think in US news we\u2019re getting to the top 20-30 in public schools every year? Which considering most states have 2, big states like Cali/Texas have 5-6 that\u2019s a pretty damn good standard. \n\nWould I pay full sticker OOS? No. \n\nWould I pay maybe a little above in state? I\u2019d say it depends on your in state options. \n\nAlso if you absolutely love Clemson and have to go here maybe look at ROTC or the reserves to pay for school. We\u2019ve got a decent ROTC program.",

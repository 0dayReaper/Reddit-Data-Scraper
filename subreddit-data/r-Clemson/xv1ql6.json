            "comment": "From my experience after almost two degrees:\n\nVery easy: Materials for Aggressive Environments (Dr. Pataky is the GOAT), Model-Based Systems Engineering\n\nSome work involved but not too bad: Cardiovascular Biomechanics,  Intro to Aerodynamics (May be hard if you hate fluids, but Dr. Li is pretty good and his tests are nearly identical to his study guides)\n\nHard but fun/cool professor: Conceptual Aircraft Design, Smart Materials (very hard but Dr. Myers is awesome, he teaches advanced strength of materials too which i heard is a bit better), Physical Metallurgy (in it right now, Dr. Fadi is great but god this class is a pain), Aircraft Design capstone (Dr. Mocko is great, class is very very time consuming though)\n\nHave heard good things about the additive manufacturing course and composite materials (both are matlab heavy though), heard both gas turbine dynamics and nuclear are alright",

You'll learn how to design supersonic nozzles and intakes (Rocket and Fighter Jet engine design) as well as learning about gas pipelines (how far can you pump a gas down a pipe without creating shock waves or need a pump station). \n\nThe caveat is that it is if you struggle with Thermo and programming you might have a tough time so it might not be a great choice if you're looking for ease. One of the final projects was designing a supersonic fighter jet inlet and it was Matlab heavy.\n\nEdit: Just want to add that the math component to compressible flow is not hard. It's mainly look up tables and trigonometry with a little bit of the intro to thermo equations.",

    "postText": " I am interested in how effective students believe their freshman introductory classes were in introducing them to their major and some of its potential career aspects. This is for a university project where I am trying to see if a lack of information regarding your major, specifically in intro classes, could potentially be a reason why so many people change their majors later on and/or graduate only to realize the field they expected to go into was utterly different. I've heard many students say that the intro classes were sub-par and they didn't really learn much because the class was more focused on trying to weed them out rather than introduce them to the subject. How well do you think your introduction classes were, and do you think they generally did a decent job preparing you for your upper-level classes? Do you think you were informed of all the resources you had at your disposal? If you could change the structure of introduction classes what would you change? Any responses would be greatly appreciated. \n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/12w98dw)",

            "comment": "CPSC 1010 and 1020 are so piss poor to introducing you to the Comp Sci major and CIS has it a bit worse being thrown straight to the business classes with no context. What\u2019s worse is when you reach your sophomore level classes and your told the new 1020 professor didn\u2019t prep you well enough but they still press on like you understand what they are talking to you about. \n\nThe coding languages bounce back and forth as you move up and you end up writing simple code in Python your senior year. There\u2019s also no point to some of the classes in the current catalog such as CPSC 2070 where we learn about discrete structures in math but it\u2019s also not a prereq or used ever again. The same can be said about CPSC 2310, made famous by Professor Feaster as the most difficult course simply because she makes it that way. Professor Wooster in Intro to Comp Sci is undoubtedly becoming worse than her with his incoherent lectures, exams, quizzes, and projects. Many times he didn\u2019t even write functioning code during class examples but was adamant that it should have worked and that if we see it on an exam, should assume it will work all the time. The only worthwhile intro professor was Russell for CPSC 1010. Unfortunately you never get to see her again unless you do the capstone course or one of the masters programs.",

I still wonder if the teacher would have been better if I'd have stuck with it and not felt so overwhelmed.\n\nStill finished in 4 years so no biggie though.",

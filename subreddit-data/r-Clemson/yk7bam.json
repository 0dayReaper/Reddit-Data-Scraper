Clemson 1 lowered my rent $5 when I renewed so obviously tenants were expecting rent to stay about the same, so they're basically trapping people into paying more than they were expecting by not giving time to look into other options. I'm glad I'm graduating cuz my roommates are kinda screwed\n\nETA: they also dont respond to maintenance requests or emails. you basically have to call them if you want anything to get done",

It\u2019s also reasonably priced and has a shuttle to and from campus every half hour. Just make sure you spray the apartment for bugs and spiders because like any South Carolinian home, there will be a few. They are about to remodel tho so idk if availability and rent will be changing.",

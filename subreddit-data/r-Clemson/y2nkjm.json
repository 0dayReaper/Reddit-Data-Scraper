    "postText": "I am a current student at Clemson and I was looking to walking on to the football team as a punter/place kicker. I can punt about 45-50 yards in the air with a usual roll of 10-15 yards, with pretty good consistency.  And I can consistently kick  field goal anything 40 yards and under, my range is around 48-50 yards. I have no prior football experience though. I  hoping to make it as a backup kicker or punter. Would I have any chance in making the team for the 2023-2024 season?",

            "comment": "Kicking i think were good. Punting were pretty weak on I mean 50 yards in the air isnt horrible but to be honest any athlete can do that that played soccer. Hang time is more important above 4.3 seconds is needed. Not everyone can get the hang time and the distance. I can punt 50 yds every time but like a 3 second hang time. If you literally have never tried they might give you a shot on practice squad. Do they see someone who is doing 45-50 who could do 60-65 in a year? They are unlikely to trust you ever in a game because of your lack of experience but for practice squad maybe? My uncle punted in NFL so i know a little but no expert",

I have dealt with most of Clemsons kickers and punters all the back when Catanzaro and pinion were there. I would for sure give it a shot like a lot of people have said. Worst case they say no and you tried your best.the best case is you get to enjoy Clemson for its education and amazing football team. Good luck and if you ever need anything cleat wise let me know\ud83e\udd19",

You basically just get in touch with the athletic department to get the information. May be more gated nowadays since the team is so good. \n\nThere were about ~110 people who tried out and did various drills. I made it along with around 6 other people. \n\nProcess was quick. It was one morning of tryouts and I believe I was pulled aside and told at the end of the session that I would be on the team. They reached out to me over email with the info when it was time for me to start training with the team.\n\nFirst thing I encountered when I started practicing with the team were the dreaded Mat Drills, which was a week or two of high intensity training at like 5am every morning.\n\nGreat experience. Doesn\u2019t hurt to try. Wouldn\u2019t count on making the team, but give yourself credit for taking the chance.",

We have to have a fenced in home that allows pets (we have 4 dogs)\n\nOur budget is decently high (2000+) but it still doesn\u2019t seem like there are many options  any advice?",

It's very close to campus, and may already be saturated with students.\n\nSeneca or Anderson are some other short commute options that have a fair bit of housing.\n\nSeneca is the opposite direction of Easly, but unlike Easly there is nothing to do in Seneca. Housing is usually pretty cheap in Seneca. Anderson has a grocery store and a mall. But  there isn't much to do in Anderson either.\n\nThere are other small towns that you have even less of a housing market, like Central and Six mile. Worth looking at, but probably very few houses for rent in those types of places.",

Seneca is a retirement destination for rich northerners and because of this anything worth having around Seneca is ridiculously priced unless it's a roach motel downtown on the crack walk.\n\nCongrats Clemson. You've fucked things up so badly in this area that regular people can't afford to live here unless they live in one room like a veal.",

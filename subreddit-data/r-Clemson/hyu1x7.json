He was 17 but still very healthy. He disappeared a few times over the years (longest for a month when he decided to take a vacation at a neighbors house down the road). Looking back, I feel lucky we got all that additional time when we thought he was gone/dead. Who the fuck runs over an animal, especially a cat or dog, and keeps on driving?! Fuckers...",

I didn't want to flood the sub with posts and the lady that found her had been feeding her and keeping an eye on her until she could get a hold of me. She is pretty friendly so maybe if you were in the area! And if so, thank you for feeding her; if not, thank you for feeding a stray &lt;3",

    "postText": "I am a 2nd semester freshman planning on industrial engineering. I took Physics 1 last semester. I am planning to take Calc 3 this semester (I did Calc 1 and 2 DE before starting at Clemson) and wait on Physics 2 until the fall (I didn't love physics 1 and it was my toughest class in the fall). I just don't want to overload myself this semester. Is it fine to take a semester break between the Physics classes?",

Would recommend getting the \"hard\" stuff for you out of the way now when you have more time to focus on it.",

    "postText": "For people that want to go premed or pre dental it says on the website you can take BIOL 1030/1050 and then BIOL 1040/1060 (General Bio 1 &amp; 2) or BIOL 1100 then BIOL 1110 (Principles of Biology 1 &amp; 2).\n\nHowever, today in class the prof mentioned that 1030 was not for people interested in anything geared towards the medical field.\n\nWhich should I take if I want to do premed or pre dental? Does it really make a difference between Gen bio and Principles of bio?",

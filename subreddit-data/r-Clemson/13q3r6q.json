I don\u2019t know a lot of about it besides the blue walls but I got an exterior room that\u2019s not a corner on the second floor. Is this a good dorm or should I be worried?",

Lever will add an extra 1 to 2 minutes to your walk compared to Mauldin (assuming you are fine with taking the 2 flights of stairs, elevator might take a bit longer)",

Im not too worried about the walking to class because I run but Mauldin was in the perfect spot for me. Someone in another thread said \u201clive, laugh, lever\u201d so I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing.",

Like someone else said definitely get a power strip, there are only 3 outlets on each side of the room, and a fan is a good idea as well.",

Coming from someone who lived in mauldin, sad to see you missed out, but, they\u2019re basically the same quality. And while being in the second floor means you don\u2019t get a chance of a good view, it also means you don\u2019t have to take the elevators, which can get quite popular. Lever also has a better lounge, at least it did 4 years ago, than mauldin so that\u2019s a plus.",

            "comment": "Um, the second floor had a lot of issues with drain flies last year if I remember correctly, even more so than we did on floor 9. You are going to have asbestos popcorn ceilings so DO NOT TOUCH IT AT ALL! In my opinion, the blue walls were actually better than the gray and brown that Mauldin and Byrnes have. It at least gave the room some color! The guys named it \u201canti suicide blue\u201d at some point. There will enevitably be a floor that the weed fumes come from (it was floor 6 this past year). You will have access to the printer in Byrnes so you don\u2019t have to walk to the Library or futility search for the printer in Hendrix (I couldn\u2019t find it all year). Be careful with the elevators, they break every so often (at least one was broken every week following Spring break).\n\nLaundry is fine, just be careful with the older washing machines, they have the potential to catch fire if there is either too much or too little in the machine, so if you hear this clanging noise from the lounge, go and open it no matter whose clothes are in it. Two of the machines have been replaced and those lock once started.  If you don\u2019t pick up your clothes from either the washer or dryer, someone will just move it and put it on the counter in there.\n\nI don\u2019t know how it worked for the guys but you eventually get used to the community showers. DO NOT USE THE BATHTUB! This should be obvious: you can shower in it but don\u2019t take a bath! The bathrooms get cleaned every morning.\n\nProbably the best perk of living in Lever (and the other building in the circle) is not having to move your car on game days. Even though R1 and R2 are a bit of a walk, you will eventually get used to it. By the end of the year, I got it down from a 20 minute walk to an 8 minute walk (this walk will make you realize how many people cannot handle the South Carolina humidity and have never had to do physical activity at all). You will have to fight for parking so I would advise moving you car as little as possible, but this is true for all parking on campus.\n\nThe proximity to the Hendrix center, Redfern, and Schilletter dining hall (affectionately called Shitter, Clemson even bought this web url in October after resigning themselves to the name: [shittermenu.com](https://shittermenu.com) ). The dining hall menu will almost never be correct. Also, Peppinos is open until 1 am the entire year so you will always have at least one food option (Pizza, Lasagna, Ziti, every cake under the sun. I recommend the Lemon Berry Mascarpone and the Irish Cr\u00e8me Cake and the Pumpkin Pie). And, best of all, they added a Chick-fil-A in the Hendrix center at the beginning of the year! Only bad thing about it is that it closes at 7 pm Monday - Thursday and 6 pm on Fridays and Saturdays. Basically, you will always have food.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you much about the social environment though because they moved the RiSE program out this year. When RiSE was in there, everyone was in the same classes, stressing about the same things, and it was great because of that. Everyone got drunk on Halloween after the Chem exam during costume karaoke night\u2026yes, it was a Monday. This past year we had a few karaoke parties, a couple of cooking nights, a few poker nights, lots of video game nights, there were giant puzzles towards the end of the year, and there was always some type of poll on one of the white boards, and there is a permanent 9/11 joke on one of the boards that I don\u2019t know if it can/has been removed. I actually started taking pictures of the non academic whiteboards just to keep track of the evolution over the year. We apologize if maintenance hasn\u2019t returned the built-in microwave yet\u2026we broke it two times and they decided not to give it back. Everyone in the building getting sick at the same time was fun, gotta love Lever Fever. \n\nI will say this about the Lever lounge: the first football game night was so much fun! There were about 60 kids crammed in the lounge watching the game on the two TVs. A bunch of guys had taken mozzarella from the dining hall to make cheese bread and there was pasta constantly being cooked for about two hours \u2014 two types of sauce: pesto basil and marinara with red wine). And we had Top Gun night at one point with about 40 kids crammed onto one side of the lounge TV area because we were only using one screen. I\u2019ll send a video of it if you want because it was hilarious. There was absolutely no space and it was probably what made us get as comfortable with each other as we did. The first week you will always have someone cooking downstairs until eventually everyone devolves into studying; we had Taco Tuesday for a few weeks. I went apple picking in North Carolina one weekend and came back with 25 lbs of apples and needed to get rid of them so we made apple pie and apple tarts the next weekend.\n\nI hope this helps. I genuinely had a good year living there, apart from the drama that came from your dormmates being in all of your classes. I\u2019m sure it will be different because it\u2019s not an LLC anymore but I\u2019d recommend making a few friends outside of the building because Lever is very insular. \n\nAlso, just a recommendation, buy two pool noodles to attach to the underside of your lofted bed. This will save you from cracking your skull every day. My roommate and I zip-tied them to the bed. You will need 3 total for you and your roommate, one full one per bed and then you will have to cut the 3rd one because the bed is longer than a pool noodle.",

You\u2019re usually in luck on pasta days and every Tuesday they serve chicken tenders. Do not eat the breadsticks. Also, avoid the eggs (they changed them and they taste wrong now. Same for the biscuits, they\u2019ve got green things in them). But there is a pancake conveyor belt that all of the engineers got enamored with. If I didn\u2019t see anything I liked, I would just go to the soup station (the tomato soup is the best thing on the planet).",

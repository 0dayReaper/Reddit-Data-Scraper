(I was hoping Kanye was gonna be a guest speaker, but instead he declined to re-watch 21 Jump Street again) But this entire post/comment section does an amazing job at showing how amazingly brain dead and self contradicting everyone is.\n\nFirst, you post asking if anyone is going to protest and event you\u2019re not in favor of. That\u2019s kind of fair at first. But then get mad people are discussing a topic that you posted on A PUBLIC DISCUSSION BOARD\u2026. Then you immediately insult anyone who has not even an opposite opinion to yours, but also the neutral ones. Top that off with arguing that it\u2019s your right to protest because freedom of speech, while also not going to protest because you have work at that time, while wanting other people to go protest someone else\u2019s freedom of speech who is at their job working. Because obviously her job/career is get reactions (pro or con), go speak about whatever politics she decides to do, and use that as a career. Every politician, political commentator, political influencer, or political anything finds their niche, and it becomes their job and they do their job for money.\n\nListen, I\u2019m a good simple minded moron myself. yeah, some peoples comments are pretty dumb. But you impressively enter into intense competition with them on who can prove that they are truly the textbook definition of an uneducated swine. \n\nYour entire logic is to post something that is clearly showing you disagree with something then wait until people comment on it that have the opposing view and act surprised. Which you shouldn\u2019t be since if someone agrees they don\u2019t have anything really to add to the discussion. But then you get mad and start arguing every comment either with:\n\n\u201cWhy do you care so much that you waste your time to post responses? (Which you\u2019re intellectually doing the exact same thing you\u2019re insulting them about)\n\n\u201cWhy are you mad/against my using my first amendment right!\u201d (You posted being mad about someone you disagree with speaking about whatever it is)\n\nAssuming anyone who encourages you to use that 1st amendment right is currently enrolled and living for free off their parents money, while pointing out you have a job. Ya know. The thing almost everyone has had before and is getting a degree to get a specific/higher paying kind of job? \n\nAnd then basic name calling ranging from kindergarten insults to the simple racist/sexiest/\u201cfull in the blank\u201d-ist\n\nI do want to thank you, as you helped start very dumb arguments where I can scroll through and observe why we\u2019re all gonna go out in a ball of flames and a couple of nukes at some point. You did a very patriotic thing by arguing for no reason on something probably trivial to you while managing to stay completely oblivious to any and all self contradictions in doing so. After hearing both sides of the argument, it\u2019s clear everyone here is the idiot. \n\nI agree with none of you, but gladly disagree with all of you, because that\u2019s a lot more fun. I\u2019m now going to go enjoy my weekend and go watch 21 Jump Street. Kanye was right about that at least. It really is a good movie. I hope you all have a slightly inconvenienced day.",

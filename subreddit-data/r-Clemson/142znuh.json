I brought my own personal fan into the dorm last year since I like having a breeze on me while I sleep. My roommates did the same but it\u2019s up to you if you want to share it or not. I got one for $50 from Walmart and it works great",

            "comment": "I personally used this one from Amazon.[Fan Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0833KVF53?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share)\nI can\u2019t sleep without a fan blowing on me so I clipped this to the safety railing on my bed and it worked great. It powerful and it always blocked out my roomates noise which was a great thing for me. If you just want something for sleeping I\u2019d do something like this but it also comes with a base if you wanna use it on ur desk too. (I had 2 and did both I loved it) Hope this helps :)",

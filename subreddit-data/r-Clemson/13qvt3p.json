It's not a common thing, but it's for convenience and a just in case there's after hour issues. \nHe's a really good doctor. He's odd because he's super personable, unlike the average doctor, but he cares, and as a female patient, never have I felt he was being inappropriate towards me. Summer hours just have their schedules different than usual as well.",

No one was fired and they have odd summer hours so some doctors were giving out their numbers for continued care during their off weeks as some are out from 2-6 weeks at a time and are on an odd rotation, is what I found out from my last visit. It is difficult getting established with one doctor to have to follow up and reexplain everything to someone new so it was just out of courtesy. The doctor in reference is just odd in general because he is super personable and cracks weird jokes, unlike most doctors who diagnose, prescribe, and kick you out. \n\nAs for the OBGYN side, I have never seen the female doctor but Dr. Salter is amazing, also very personable and never inappropriate. He has a wife and daughters and extremely open minded about women's health. I saw him for an emergency IUD removal and discussed sterilization as I do not want children and clearly the birth control was giving me issues. He did not once question my decision or make the comment I always got with my previous doctor, \"I don't feel comfortable preforming that procedure, as I am sure you will change you mind later.\"  It has been 12 years since I have wanted that done and my mind has still not changed. Dr. Salter did not hesitate when I jokingly made the comment saying \"I just with I could be sterilized\", and said he would schedule me a tubal litigation and check the cost with my insurance. I say jokingly because I was expecting to be shutdown, but him saying that was a total shock and along with some other personal information that I prefer not to share from that visit, he proved himself to be a very understanding and great doctor in my opinion.",

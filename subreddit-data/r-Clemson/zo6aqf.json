    "postText": "Hi everyone. I posted two years ago on this subreddit as a clemson student about trying to start selling Clemson and upstate themed stickers and I\u2019ve been incredibly blessed to have come a long way since then. I\u2019m now on a mission to draw a design for every town in South Carolina, big or small. I just wrapped up artwork for Clemson and Greenville. If you\u2019d like to see more of my work and where I\u2019m headed next, check my bio for more info. \n\nTo mods: If this is against the rules, please delete. Just wanted to share some love for the subreddit that inspired me from the beginning to keep going.",

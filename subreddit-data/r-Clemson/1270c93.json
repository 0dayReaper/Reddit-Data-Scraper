I won't be able to take Clemson's online class because the tests are scheduled during specific time windows and I will be at an internship from 9-5 every week day. I found some accredited online courses that are accepted by other universities, for example Distance Calculus, however I was unsure if this would be an option at Clemson. Has anyone taken a math credit from an online course and NOT specifically an online technical college?",

If your only worry is the exams for the class you can probably work it out with your internship company that you need time off when those exams are scheduled",

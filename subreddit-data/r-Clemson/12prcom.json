    "postText": "Good Afternoon, \nTigers \n\nI was wondering if the right move was to email the professors directly and ask if they could open a spot for me. I\u2019ve heard on here that the closed course forms don\u2019t typically work or that people don\u2019t typically look at them. So I emailed the professors directly. Should I also email the different departments to see if they can get me into a section?\n\n\n\nThank you.",

If you\u2019re a junior or a senior and it\u2019s required I\u2019d politely ask anyone and everyone since you need it. You don\u2019t need to bother people per se, but at the same time sometimes you gotta ride some ass just to get the courses you need to graduate which I put solely on the university itself.",

I still need to take a 2 global challenges which for me the ones that sound the most interesting ones need pre-reqs of engl 2020 at least, still need a non-lit done as well but i\u2019m not as pushy on that one.",

If you have a previous  catalog year associated with when you started it would be old rules with the cross cultural awareness and such. I would double check to be sure.",

As long as you do it politely and say something flattering (I\u2019ve heard great things about your class, I think I\u2019d really benefit from your teaching style, etc.), then you should get a spot. I\u2019ve done this for lots of different classes/profs and I\u2019ve always gotten a spot, even when I was a sophomore. Plus, they\u2019re typically just busy, not ignoring you, so I say keep pushing in a nice way. What\u2019s the worst that could happen? They say no or don\u2019t respond",

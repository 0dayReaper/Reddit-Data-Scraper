My professor doesn\u2019t have his email on canvas so I\u2019ve been messaging him directly on canvas and he doesn\u2019t respond to anything, highly frustrating. Does anyone know if I\u2019d fail the leisure class by now for that?",

Good luck.\n\nEdit: Btw I found that contact information in the My.Clemson app. All students, faculty, and staff can login and search the directory. Super easy peasy.",

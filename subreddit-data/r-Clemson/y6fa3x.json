    "postText": "1. When does the application become binding? Is it when you fill it out, after placement, or can you drop out anytime?\n2. Are RAs guaranteed a private room? And if in a suite does this include a private bathroom?\n3. How does placement work? I am currently on the community council in my community, so would I be likely to be placed in the same community? Also if I set LLCs would I be likely to get into any if I've never been in one? Is it a high chance I will end up in a random community with no relation to where I have lived or the LLCs I selected?\n\nEdit: One more question, when should I expect to find out if I got it and what my placement will be?",

Some places like Calhoun and Lightsey 1 have you share I believe. \n\nCommunity council doesn\u2019t really mean anything at all other than the community director might know you better and will choose you for their community. If you\u2019ve never been in an LLC you likely won\u2019t get placed in one either, they strongly prefer people who have been in it before.\n\nMost likely you\u2019ll get a community you\u2019ve never lived in before.",

If i were to do it again shoe boxes were fine no problem there kinda gross but fine, lightsey bridge was awful because the bridge kids were wild as fock, douthit was heaven on earth. Once you finish your interview, they will give you a assigned community. You can decline that and you\u2019re not guaranteed a spot in another community but you might get one I would not decline it unless you got assigned Lightsey.",

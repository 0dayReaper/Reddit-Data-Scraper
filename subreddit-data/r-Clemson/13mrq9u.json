I like \u201cA very secret service\u201d on Netflix! Another option is YouTube videos on anything you find interesting, and then you can do subtitles and even slow the video down. Listening is 100% a practice thing in French, it took a few months in Paris before I could feel out where one word ended and the next word started hah",

See what they say about it for FR 2020, and good luck fellow Tiger \ud83d\udc4d",

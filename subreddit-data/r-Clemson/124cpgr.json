Not law enforcement or an official investigator, but a random documentary film maker. He is under no obligation, public or private, to participate in something like this. \n\nI don\u2019t blame him for declining.",

If it wasn't a death, it was a very serious injury.  There were plenty of non-Greek life incidents, as well.  A few were particularly horriffic and involved trains and the bridge that crosses Lake Hartwell near what is now the Pier.",

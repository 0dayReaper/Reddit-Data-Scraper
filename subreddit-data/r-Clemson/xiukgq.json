            "comment": "I'm an employer but won't be at the career fair.  I'll give you a different perspective.  Employers will get a ton of resumes while they are there.  That's fine.  But when you have the opportunity for personal interaction, make an attempt at actually interacting (versus just dropping off your resume).  Ask questions about the company.  What's their culture like?  How would they differentiate themselves from their competitors?  What are they looking for out of a newly minted college graduate?  What's that career path look like?\n\nIt was hard for me to understand this when I was just out of college.  But, those interviews are 2-way streets.  They have to convince you they're an awesome place to work.  So, while you'll be a little nervous, keep in mind that you are valuable and the company needs to put in some effort to recruit you.  If they don't seem to care about recruiting you, move on.  You don't want to be a part of an organization that can't even sell you on their value proposition.",

            "comment": "Advice as an employer: please, for the love of god, look ahead at the employer list and narrow it down a little for yourself based on what field you\u2019re looking to start a career in. Look at the companies a little, make yourself a list of who you want to talk to, do just a bare minimum check into what it is the company does before you come and chat with us. \n\nI\u2019ve been coming to the career fair for the past 8 years. There\u2019s something disappointing about a senior coming up to me and asking point blank what it is my company does. The Michelin Center spends a lot of time putting these together, and provides you all the tools you could need to do a bit of background work so that you don\u2019t have to visit every single firm; there are many companies coming that you will have zero interest in working for, because to do so would be a complete shift from what you have potentially gone to school for. You will save yourself, and them, a lot of time by doing the little pre work (including a quick google\nof a company\u2019s website or project profile), AND you\u2019ll look like a prepared rock star in comparison to many other students. \n\nOther than that? Have fun, don\u2019t be too nervous, because we were exactly where you were not too long ago. Dress \u201cnice\u201d (professionally), have a firm hand shake, look us in the eye when you talk to us.\n\nEdit: and YES, bring your resumes. Sure, there\u2019ll be a few large firms there that have tablets or some other way to fill out an application right there; but there will be many smaller firms that will love to get a copy of the resume instead.",

(As mentioned previously, do not ask what they do) have an idea of what companies you are interested in. And go speak with them and tell them you are a senior that\u2019s interested in a job with them. Good luck!",

He was told \u201cwe don\u2019t need any more.\u201d Don\u2019t just depend on the fair, though it is a great way to brush up on your interviewing &amp; interaction skills. Def bring all your info to give to prospective employers. Make sure you do your research on companies out there, and good luck!!!",

Know the companies before, Bring resumes, dress nice, speak formally, and look them in the eyes is all important but there is one bit that I feel needs to be driven home. Always be yourself, forgot that bs generic answers to questions they may ask. Answer their questions as honest as you can and make sure you show them who you are. I applied to 7 jobs and got offered 7 jobs with all of the jobs commenting about my ability to show them me and not just some credentials. That human factor goes a long way.\n\nAlso don't stress about it. The more you stress, the more likely you won't do good. If you're nervous so are others, if you feel like you said something stupid, so did others. You're not the only one",

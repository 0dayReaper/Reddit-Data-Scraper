As such, you shouldn't be worried whether course is gonna be tough or easy. You should be worried if they offer the course or not, since you seem to have finalised Clemson I'm assuming you've done that research.\n\nYou can actually go through the courses that will be offered in the coming semester through Iroar. You can also check the [clemson course catalogue](https://catalog.clemson.edu/content.php?catoid=26&amp;catoid=26&amp;navoid=781&amp;filter%5Bitem_type%5D=3&amp;filter%5Bonly_active%5D=1&amp;filter%5B3%5D=1&amp;filter%5Bcpage%5D=26) for more information.",

            "comment": "I\u2019d suggest to first shortlist course based on your background and then FIRST, directly contact the instructor to inquire about the course and ask the right questions that will help you decide if you should opt for the course or not. If a course is easy and sure to get you an A or a min B, then you aren\u2019t learning anything. Don\u2019t focus on scoring the best grade but rather securing the best learning from the course.\n\nEdit: you can also look up course content on iRoar to check how relevant it is to your background. On another note, I have seen students take up courses completely different from their background to learn a new topic or develop a new skill which complements their existing skills/knowledge. Ex: mech student taking up advanced maths or comp science courses to develop problem solving skills or utility for problem solving.",

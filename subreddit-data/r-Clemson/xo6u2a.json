    "postText": "Hi, currently a freshman applying for living next year since apparently you have to be urgent and early about getting a place for next year, if anyone has lived in any of these, any input would be greatly appreciated. Obviously I want somewhere nice, but if it is cheaper and not the fanciest I am also fine with that. Just don't want something 100 years old or disgusting and unlivable. Looking for good places for 3-4 girls that aren't party animals and like peace and quiet. These are the apartments being considered:\n\n* Clemson Edge\n* The Reserve \n* The Enclave\n* Clemson Lofts\n* Tiger Towne\n* The Villages at Towne Creek\n* The Ridge\n* Signature Hartwell Village\n* The Pier (flats)",

            "comment": "I lived in Edge for two years and it was fairly nice. They just recently updated all appliances and furniture. Super convenient being right beside the Walmart. CatBus picks up and drops off at edge. They have a nice pool, basketball/tennis court, small gym, dog park, etc. One major downside is the traffic that accumulates because Walmart/Oreilys/Edge sharing an entrance. Overall a nice place to live. Never had any major issues. With that being said, I live at the Cottages now and much prefer it here. Not much more money with a much nicer living space and much more room. Downsides are no gym, have to pay for the furniture package unless you bring your own. \n\nFrom experience of friends, stay way from the ridge.",

I favored the pier more because the amenities are admittingly really good for being included and management was pretty responsive. I heard they are under new management now tho and the increased prices across the board. Just stay away from the ridge as I heard management there is the worst at Clemson.",

They wouldn\u2019t break my lease and they wouldn\u2019t let me move into another unit because they were all full they said so until I get my uncle, He\u2019s a lawyer to call them. Shady shouldnt do people like that. The one I agreed to move into ended up being dirty and having a broken dishwasher and washer and dryer, took like two months before they fix them. My apartment also flooded while living there probably 2 inches thick of water due to the unit above me.  that unit had over a foot of water in it.",

    "postText": "Hello Clemson gen chem students! I am offering free chemistry help for general chemistry students via YouTube. Every Wednesday at 7pm (EST) I have an interactive live stream on general chemistry topics. \n\nThis week we are working on salts with acid/base properties. We will discuss how to identify salts that have acid/base properties as well as how to calculate the pH of those salts. Time permitting, we will also discuss polyprotic acids and calculating the pH of those solutions. You are welcome to join in and ask questions in the chat and request other chemistry topics/problems for future live streams.\n\nI was a college professor (mostly general chemistry, but a bit of organic as well) for ten years. The YouTube channel is Chem Help ASAP (link here: [https://www.youtube.com/c/ChemHelpASAP](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChemHelpASAP)) I hope I can help you understand chemistry a bit better!",

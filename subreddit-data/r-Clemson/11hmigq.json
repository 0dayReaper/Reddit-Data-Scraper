However let\u2019s assume you are one of them I will give the best info I know:\n\nBiggest difference is that Mickel has more common area space than Holmes, which only shares a bathroom. Only complaint I have heard from people who live in Mickel is that the new scoreboard at the football stadium has a sound system that literally shakes their dorm. I also can\u2019t imagine that walking up that monster hill every day is very fun either. If you end up getting these good roommates will be so important because you will be responsible for cleaning your own bathrooms and common areas as well as keeping them stocked and that can become a sour topic quick. Also, and this could be due to personal circumstances, but you will likely rarely ever be in your dorm freshman year. Don\u2019t get me wrong having a good living space is important, but at the same time dorms mostly function just to be where you crash and spend the occasionally study/pregame session, I wouldn\u2019t look too much into it. The happiest and coolest people I have met on campus lived in the shoeboxes if that gives any indication as to how little your dorm matters (unless you are dumb like me and choose to live in Douthit).",

Holmes and McCabe are both suite style and have other LLCs in them so I\u2019d look into those and see if you qualify if you want to live in suite style",

They\u2019re pretty much the same quality of living space, but Mickel is on a pretty steep hill, which you would have to walk up to go pretty much anywhere. Other than that they\u2019re both the same.",

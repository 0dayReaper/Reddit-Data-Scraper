Kinda a big change so I\u2019m looking to go somewhere good. \n\nAlso is it better to schedule an appointment since it\u2019s a big thing or could I just walk-in to these places?\n\nThanks everyone!",

Most of Reddit assumes any user is a man not a woman.    \n\nHair south downtown, Untangled downtown, moda vita in Seneca, fusion in Anderson, and blondies (paper cash money only) in Anderson are the major salons around here. If you have it, try checking their Facebook / instagram.  \n\nI would definitely call ahead for an appointment. Ask for someone who\u2019d be good with a big chop and x length hair (are you looking for chin, above shoulder, below shoulder, length).   \nIf you have the transport, time, and money, Kate Kandel salon in downtown Greenville is amazing. But very expensive.   \nIf you\u2019re not confident in describing the cut you want definitely do some googling or pinteresting if you have that, to bring some reference pictures for yes I like this, and no I don\u2019t want that.",

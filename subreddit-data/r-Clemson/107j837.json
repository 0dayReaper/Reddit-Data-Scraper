            "comment": "So right now there are three professors in the German Department, with the head being Dr (Herr) Johannes Schmidt. The club advisor per the dept website is (Herr) Harris King. oswaldk@clemson.edu\n\nhttps://www.clemson.edu/caah/academics/languages/languages/german.html  \n  \nI was an active member of the German club as a student. They\u2019re a decent amount of fun. I met a lot of friends through there and got hooked up with my study abroad program (Uni Bamberg) through them. I recommend joining the FB group if you have an account. Otherwise, reach out to Herr King (as we call the profs in the dept) or Herr Schmidt.  \n  \nWe have a decently large amount of German students on campus due to the BMW connection and multiple exchange programs with unis over there. I did Bamberg and we typically had at least 2-5 students from there do their exchange at Clemson.  \n  \nAs you can also guess, there\u2019s a lot of Germans up in the GSP area due to BMW and their related suppliers having major operations there. The BMW internships are some of the most coveted, depending on the program. I had a buddy of mine that did Electrical Engineering at Clemson, and he did his study abroad through Global E3/Technical University of Munich to learn engineering German and then nabbed an internship (and later full time job) with BMW afterward.",

I\u2019m not sure if Herr Schmidt or Herr King have been actively trying to revive it (I\u2019ve moved on to grad school over in Greenville), but Herr Ferrell and I have been talking about growing a new conversation group that\u2019s also open for alumni. I would reach out to him for details!",

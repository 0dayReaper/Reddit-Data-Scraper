He could then play and learn under Brady for a couple years, becoming the Ultra-GOAT in the process.\n\nOr perhaps he'd go to Miami and I could watch him and Wilkins on the same team. But obviously the chances of either happening are well lower than me winning the lotto. \n\nKind of bummed about him playing for Jacksonville. But who knows, maybe he'll help get things turned around there.",

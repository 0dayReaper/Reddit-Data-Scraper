The opportunities for a GGA, GLA, or GRA depend on your English skills and your advisor\u2019s funding. GLAs are with the department as they teach a class, so that isn\u2019t dependent on your advisor. \n\nOne of my friends has been a little frustrated working with Dr. Kung, but he doesn\u2019t plan on switching advisors either. Also, Dr. Kung plays the drums. Fun fact.",

I\u2019m delaying phd as probably going to go elsewhere (I did undergrad at clemson too). The department overall is solid though. I\u2019ve picked up things that I\u2019ve used in industry that other schools didn\u2019t know. \n\nI did thesis which was 8 classes (most of which are core classes that you must take) plus like 12 hours of research. I ended up doing 9 courses plus 30 hours research. Non thesis is 11 classes\n\nAs for assistantships. It can be tough since the department grew a lot. Like others said it depends on the funding of a professor for positions like GRA, GTA. There aren\u2019t a ton of GTAs either. The next best would be GGA and that is what most often gets given out to master students. \n\nDefinitely approach your prospective advisor with the intent of good research, work ethic, and personality. Talk to the grad students under that advisor and ask about the funding stuff. If you think it\u2019s a good match and the advisor likes you then ask about funding. You definitely won\u2019t get your advisor if you go in asking for money.",

I liked almost all my professors and classes and thought it was way better than undergrad.\n\nDefinitely good research opportunities, I quit mine after I figured out research was not for me. It\u2019s hard to get an assistantship without an advisor though, you have to basically know a professor semi-personally.",

I'd say both teaching and presenting at conferences / preparing papers prepares you professionally. Not sure if CEDAR is still kicking since Summers left, but we did weekly presentation practice as well as tearing each other apart, which is worse than you'll ever get professionally. The advice I always gave to students was if you felt like delaying the \"real world\" for a couple years, more learning, it was worth the time investment. Feel free to reach out.",

If students make up their mind senior year, secure a GTA or GRA, it's not like it's a big stipend, but it's paid for and you get to just keep learning (what you actually want to) with less pressure for a year or two. I found most of the courses ended up being helpful later in industry in some form or fashion as well.",

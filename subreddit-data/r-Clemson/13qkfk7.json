It was intended to be a temporary measure, however, the vulnerability seems to keep reoccurring for some reason that none of us know.\n\nIt\u2019s also not an issue Clemson can necessarily fix - we buy a solution from someone, and they have other integrations with other vendors in their platform, and that\u2019s where the vulnerabilities have been occurring. We\u2019re as powerless and frustrated on the issue as everyone else.\n\nAs for the licensing issues, that\u2019s a money thing. Google changed their pricing schedule and now everyone has to suffer for it.",

And I can\u2019t even use the vpn if I\u2019m not on my laptop (not that I can find the download file from when I originally got the vpn and now can no longer use it!).\n\nI swear to god, my friends at USC actually laughed at me when I had to pull up iRoar in front of them to access DegreeWorks! I\u2019ve seen USC\u2019s system and it\u2019s nowhere near as complicated to log in off-campus.\n\nThe only blessing is that only Duo is required for just Canvas.",

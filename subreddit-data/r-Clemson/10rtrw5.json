    "postText": "I am planning to study abroad in a year and a half (3 semesters from now), and I figured that it would not hurt to be as prepared as possible.\n\nDoes anyone who has studied abroad have any recommendations for an easy living arrangement? Ideally would still be with my friends, so does anybody know of an off campus apartment or something that offers a 6 month lease? \n\nAs a last resort, I assume that you can live on-campus for just one semester, but ideally I would live off campus with my friends without having to sublet, although if a specific complex makes subletting easy or simple that could work.",

If you want something easy, I would definitely recommend that route. \n\nIf you must live off campus, just don\u2019t live downtown, really hard to sublet those. Harts cove was easy to sublet last I tried. Short term leases usually aren\u2019t worth it imo, but you could sublet from someone else the semester before you go.",

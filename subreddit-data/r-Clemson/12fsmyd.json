Changed to purple some time in the 70\u2019s or 80\u2019s probably. Again could be totally wrong but I think that\u2019s the story",

He also brought old faded Auburn practice uniforms where the blue had faded to purple.\n\nOur purple is [now] officially called Regalia. Purple has always been Clemson\u2019s official secondary color, never blue. *However* navy blue has been used extensively throughout the years by fans, university academics, and on team uniforms. During the tenure of President Jim Barker, Clemson began narrowing its focus to maintain a stable, recognizable, national brand and phased out the use of blue as an unofficial secondary color. \n\nBlue is still popular in fan attire but I think that\u2019s because it\u2019s relatively generic like grey or black",

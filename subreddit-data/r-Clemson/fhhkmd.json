And while it's not gonna make the administration do anything, this is exactly the place for Clemson students to discuss their concerns with other students. And lol \"clogging up the sub,\" because this sub was so active before that. A veritable hotbed of activity. Oh no, we drowned out all 4 of the posts not about coronavirus yesterday. If the mods thought there were too many coronavirus posts they should have created a megathread about it and removed all other posts. Also I noticed you're not bitching about the number of posts that were bitching about people wanting the school shut down due to coronavirus. Because that definitely contributed to \"clogging up the sub\" as well.",

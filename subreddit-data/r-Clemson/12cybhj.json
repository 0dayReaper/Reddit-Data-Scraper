I thought I would take a moment to pose a couple questions to the sub, as your input is greatly appreciated.\n\nThere have been a number of forsale posts lately. Instead of cluttering r/Clemson, would anyone care to move these to something like /r/ClemsonForSale or somewhere else? This would be a mostly unmoderated subreddit and use at your own risk. Currently we let a few through that could be of use, and don't approve the very shady ones. We can continue this policy. \n\nSubreddit mods. If you would like to be a mod for r/Clemson please LMK. It only takes a few minutes of your day to look through the pose queue and apply common sense. We are mostly hands off with the content here, but it would always be nice to have some extra help. \n\nHow do you think things are going in r/Clemson? Is there anywhere you think we could improve? \n\nThank you all for making this one of the more chill subs on Reddit. You all mostly behave and we all seem to have a good time. Everyone mostly has good manners towards others. It is a positive for the area and university when folks look here for information. \n\nGo Tigers!",

Either a separate sub is made and mods are committed to checking it too, or keep the good filtering policies here intact in my view. Just food for thought!",

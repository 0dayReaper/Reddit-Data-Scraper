Otherwise you\u2019ll have to do the foothills trail, something put together at Paris Mountain, or sections of the mountains to sea trail or AT. Linville Gorge is 4 hours away but there are several loops there to be done. \n\n- source: done all of the ones I\u2019ve just mentioned.",

            "comment": "This may be part of the Foothill Trail system but there is a trail that starts at Bad Creek Project (right on the NC/SC border) and heads along the Thompson River in NC.  You can pull out at the bridge that is along Whitewater Road (think it is highway 130 or something).  However, this is some very rugged hiking with a lot of waterfalls and even though it is close it is considered remote in terms of getting help if something goes wrong so I would suggest you do this with someone else.  I fished the river years ago and it is in a deep gorge and we had to climb a few waterfalls.  I heard the scenery on the hike is incredible.  There are also campsites as well as it is more than a day hike for sure.  If I remember correctly the road where the trail comes out and meets Whitewater is called Brewer Road.  You would definitely want to drop a car there to drive back to Bad Creek.",

So it is hard because you may get stumped on questions you never heard of. \nA lot of students have to retake these classes. \nI have even heard of taking this class somewhere else and transferring it in. I don\u2019t know if that is possible but don\u2019t let this experience get you too down.",

I did because on the second class our professors in a pop quiz that was gonna count for 5% agreed and all of us didn\u2019t get a question right Real asshole. Said his goal was to fail half of us said the first day I had enrolled took it at Tech. What are your career goals if it involves grad school such as med school I would advise against this.",

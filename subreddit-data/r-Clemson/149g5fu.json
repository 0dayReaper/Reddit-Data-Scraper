    "postText": "Hi, I will be coming to Atlanta on 4 or 5 July in the evening. What would be the best method to get to Clemson from ATL? I have been looking into one-way rental cars but there are not any options that I could find. Is there any bus service available? \n\nIf anyone is travelling on the same dates and can accommodate me, I will be grateful. I am willing to split the cost.",

People do take the Amtrak. \n\nA rental car should be possible though. I think I have done that once and then I dropped the car in Anderson (from there you will still need a ride back to Clemson).",

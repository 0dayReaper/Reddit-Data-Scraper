    "postText": "I got admit on mechanical engineering for Ms program in clemson university as well as Texas tech University. I am in so much confusion in choosing one of them. I got $1000 scholarship along with out-state tuition waiver from texas tech. But i heard i could get funding from assistantship in clemson university. So can you help me in giving some suggestions on what could be the best option?",

For example, if you're picking between MIT or Clemson for engineering, you should almost always pick MIT because their engineering school is just better.",

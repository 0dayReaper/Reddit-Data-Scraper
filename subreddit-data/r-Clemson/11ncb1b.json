I loved it down there and wish I could have stayed more than anything...but I don't think I would have racked up that much debt if I knew I'd have nothing to show for it and no reasonable way to pay it back. These loan companies are insanely predatory.",

I was able to get rid of most of my debt, but before that happened I was beyond panicked. I was defaulting because the payments were just under $1000 a month, with interest rates at like 12%, and I wasn't making anywhere near that. And I couldn't refinance cause I wasn't making enough money. I have literally no idea what would have happened. I wouldn't have been able to survive.",

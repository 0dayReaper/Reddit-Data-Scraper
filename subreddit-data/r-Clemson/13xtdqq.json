The only time that sort of age gap might be a problem is if they\u2019re not a student. And that\u2019s not going to happen in Calhoun courts.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t mind it if I were you. Don\u2019t mess with their routine, and they won\u2019t mess with yours.\n\nEdit: maybe they\u2019ll teach you a thing or two about living on your own too. He\u2019s had plenty of time to do that. I\u2019m a recent alum that\u2019s living in the area and keeps a somewhat messy but clean house, but I\u2019ve been in the apartments of some characters. Just do your dishes, make sure the toilet isn\u2019t fucking black with mold like some people do. Seriously. I know seniors (plural) that do this and lord help them if a girl comes over. If you get takeout, write the date so a week from now you can toss it so it doesn\u2019t clog up the fridge. Your room is your room, but just out of politeness try not to make it a pigsty because the smell does carry. If you\u2019re gonna not do laundry for a bit (like me sometimes) try to keep that confined to your room. Just general \u201cliving with others\u201d politeness. In Japanese it\u2019s called \u201cminding the space.\u201d (Ki o tsukau/\u6c17\u3092\u4f7f\u3046, it\u2019s also a game on switch that\u2019s like the impossible game but with etiquette lol)",

I had a random roommate who was the usual college age (I'd guess 19, but we never talked about it). I lived about an hour away from campus, so I didn't feel like putting the hours and miles on my car (and me), so I just stayed in the dorms. It was nice to have my meals cooked for me, and lots of free time without the distractions of home to study.",

Turns out that was my roommate and he was 42. A father of a 13 year old plus an alcoholic and the first night was smoking crack in a chair with some dude he met at a bar. So I would try to verify who you are rooming with for sure.",

            "comment": "If he's 41 then that\u2019s a problem and I feel like there are only two ways he'll be: creepy or creepier. People here saying he could help teach you life lessons have good intentions but I think they\u2019re wrong. If he's just a normal 41 year old living with you, then that's still creepy because there's such a massive age gap.  If he's a 41 year old trying to be an 18 year old college kid that's much worse.\n\nI\u2019m 38 and I\u2019m just about to have my second child and by most standards I\u2019m relatively old to just be on child #2. The fact that there\u2019s a 41 year old who\u2019s willing to live on campus with 18-19 year olds is weird.  I get angry enough when I have to write a check to the IRS--I can't imagine being my age and having to listen to the rules of an RA who was born the same year I graduated high school.\n\nI arrived at Clemson in 2004 (I know, I'm old) and lived in Calhoun Courts N1B with some other transfer students...Calhoun Courts is not a convenient location.  It's past all the freshman dorms and not particularly close to any actual classrooms.  My second year I lived in Calhoun Courts S7G, and in my third year I lived on Sloan St behind the old Astro movie theater...the distance to campus was about the same and there are now a lot more housing options closer to campus than Sloan St, so he's not living on campus for convenience.\n\nIt's admirable that this person is going for their college degree regardless of age.  I think he should be applauded for that...however a reasonable person should realize they're not going to have the traditional college experience and prepare accordingly.  I'd consider it completely normal if this guy had his own apartment and went out to the bars at night and mingled with the college crowd, even though he's considerably older, but there's something about living with people who are 20 years younger than you that's unsettling to me. He should be in an off campus apartment.\n\nIf I were you, I'd do my best to get out of this living arrangement.",

    "postText": " I am transferring out of state and desperately need someone to take over my lease at Clemson Lofts this coming academic year. It's one room in a 4x4, the three other guys are sophomores at Clemson and are very quiet and respectful guys. Rent is 12 installments of $820 with utilities paid for along with valet trash service. The apartment comes fully furnished and the only extra charge you have to cover is the $20 application fee. Pets are allowed, only about a mile from campus, bus directly to campus every 8 minutes, free parking with a big parking lot, tons of other benefits. Please message me for any other information.",

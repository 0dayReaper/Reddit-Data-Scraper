    "postText": "Obviously, I'm not majoring in all of these so this is just an opinion and seems to be the somewhat common consensus between a lot of people. A few spots can change, but this is my opinion from someone who's studying computer engineering. \n\n1. Chemical - A lot of chemical engineering majors switch out after their first year from what I hear. Not only does it already include a difficult subject like chemistry, but you also have to be able to do some pretty complex math. \n\n2. Electrical - Speaking as someone who's in computer engineering, all my ECE classes that don't have coding have all been my most difficult. Electronics, signals, and random signals have all been a pain.\n\n3. Computer - Might be biased here but as someone who's in CPE, my hardest classes have been the ones taken with other EEs while my easiest ones have been CPSC. \n\n4. Mechanical - From what I've heard, Mechanical is the most difficult out of the big three \"Mech/Civil/Ind\" majors due to the fact they have to take Statics and Dynamics as a single course instead of two classes. \n\n5. Civil - Don't know many civil engineers, but I hear jokes that people who can't do MechE switch to Civil. \n\n6. Industrial - Don't know many Industrial engineers, but I also hear jokes that people who can't do Civil switch to Industrial.\n\nNot including the other engineering majors related to biology because I'm unfamiliar with those and don't really know anyone to vouch for their difficulty. What do you guys think?\n\nEDIT: Only for undergrad majors",

            "comment": "Lol I used to work for Landmark. This is so on brand for them.  \n  \nI worked for them at a property by another college in NC and it was awful. All Landmark cared about what building (or buying) shitty buildings, getting them to 100% occupancy, then selling them. I quit because the job paid garbage for awful stressful work, they asked me to charge residents without photos, and I saw how much they paid for furnishings and repair and what they charged residents. It\u2019s criminal. On top of that, the property I worked at didn\u2019t open on time and had to put residents up in hotels for a semester. So most of the community and school hated us long before I got there.  \n  \nAny residents should file BBB complaints against them and constantly bombard their corporate office in Athens. They\u2019re truly evil. On top of that, the amounts they charge for rent are astronomical. It\u2019s not going to materials/furnishings (which are cheap and ordered in bulk), it\u2019s not going to salaries, and it\u2019s not going to repairs or property improvements. Just goes straight into the owners\u2019 pockets. Leave now if you can. They are as predatory as it gets - we had to pretty much harass leads into signing terrible leases. So much so most people blocked us or stopped answering.",

I had panic attacks before work every morning working for them, and only lasted 6 months or so.  \n  \nWe called our property \u201cThe Gilded Turd\u201d. It seems luxurious on the outside, but one look under the hood and you\u2019ll see it\u2019s a pile of shit. Everything was built as cheaply as possible but given window dressing to make it look luxurious. It\u2019s not. I saw the catalog and website that they ordered their furniture from. The bulk of their profits came from damages, which they upcharged 400-500% during move out. On top of that, being the rent man was fucking awful. Since I lived at the place, I had to run into residents I was threatening with eviction when I would grocery shop or go to the restaurants nearby.  \n  \nI\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t work for an apartment complex anymore. It\u2019s soulless work for evil companies and Landmark was a repeat offender. Just check the reviews of most of their properties - you can always tell when they\u2019ve paid or incentivized positive reviews so you can discount them (they have a certain sanitized feel to their language, we would often order pizza for residents that gave us good reviews). Most are gonna talk about how terrible their service and their prices are. Nowhere in Clemson is worth $3000+/month. It\u2019s still fucking Pickens (or Oconee) County after all.  \n  \nFind yourself a place like Daniel Square or somewhere on Craigslist/Facebook before signing with either Landmark property in Clemson. You can thank me later.",

It\u2019s pretty much all the same no matter who built it because the industry uses the same vendors and contractors. The only local things they ever contracted out were things like carpet and painting. Everything else was most likely pre fabbed by the same companies with supply chains in Asia, and then shipped on site and assembled like an IKEA furniture piece.  \n  \nI did comp shops on similarly owned properties throughout the Carolinas and saw the same things/features/brands everywhere I went. It\u2019s how those buildings all have soulless and lifeless feels to them.

Sherman\u2019s done a bunch of projects throughout the Carolinas and they\u2019ve also done Lakeside Lodge here at CU.  \n  \nJust pulling some data from various sources (construction journal and Pickens County records), they had pre fab concrete and used a lot of the same subs we did for our building. It\u2019s a relatively interconnected industry, and most of the GC firms that do student (multi family technically) housing work with each other. Conferences and the like were where Landmark really networked with them.  \n  \nAnd again, this doesn\u2019t address what is likely maintenance deficiencies on Landmark\u2019s part. My property properly winterized because of the location. It\u2019s on Landmark for not properly educating residents and for not having their maintenance staff prepare for cold temperatures like this. That\u2019s really on brand for what I experienced with them, as our three guys could barely keep up with the maintenance ticket load despite resolving probably 10 tickets each per day.  \n  \nIt doesn\u2019t really matter who did the construction in this case, as construction pretty much washes their hands once CO is issued, final inspections are passed, and residents move in. Since this property has been open for awhile, it\u2019s on the current managers to do their proper PM\u2019s, inspections, and be staffed enough to handle the workload needed to prevent situations like these. Landmark has properties in colder climates like Michigan and Boulder. They know what needs to be done when cold snaps like these come through (which are frequent enough that even Clemson should have a decent skeleton to handle them). Cutting corners in the construction and housing industry is widespread but it tends to result in situations like these. The fact that Landmark hasn\u2019t commented on a property being friggin red tagged (which is a huge deal, that\u2019s typically a last resort situation short of condemnation), tells you all you need to know. They\u2019re in deep shit that they likely won\u2019t get out of at least in Clemson for the foreseeable future.  \n\nStaffing, specifically for maintenance positions, was something Landmark never did well because they paid like shit. I don\u2019t need to post here, but check indeed and you\u2019ll see how many of their properties are hiring for management staff. It\u2019s insane how much they churned through assistant managers.

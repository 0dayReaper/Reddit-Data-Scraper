On-campus housing might be better to adjust to campus, but there is very little on-campus housing as a sophomore available in general. I live on campus in Douthit West and it\u2019s really, really nice, so if you try for on campus look for a spot there. Hope this helps:)",

It's a private room/bathroom in a 4BR, my other roommates are good friends of mine and generally sociable guys.\n\nBase rent is $585 but I can cut you a check for the difference if that is over your budget.  DM me if you're interested, the complex is called Crawford Falls.",

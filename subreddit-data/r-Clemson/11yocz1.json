Communal bathrooms, elevators get really crowded at certain times, etc. Honestly tho there\u2019s pros and cons to every dorm. I\u2019ve heard the shoeboxes can suck but I\u2019m not sure as I didn\u2019t live there. Tbh tho I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll share a room with a roommate in all of the freshman dorms. Just try to make as many friends as possible with the people living around you and you\u2019ll be fine.",

            "comment": "Honestly location on campus can matter a lot more than the actual dorm. Another thing to factor in is if you're interested in a living learning community. These give you access to special classes or resources and can be identity, major or interest based. I highly recommend looking and seeing if anything is interesting because I loved my living learning community and still have friends and connections from it. \n\nThinking about location, are you a big football fan? Do you want to be near all the action? What about other sports? If you're interested in sports I would recommend somewhere in \"core campus\" which would be mickel, gressette, shoeboxes, holmes/McCabe. This is also a great area to be close to the Greek quad if you're interested in Greek life. (Not to say if you aren't don't live around here because there's lots of other reasons)\n\nIf you want to meet people in your dorm a lot of the high rises and the shoeboxes have really good community from what I have heard. If affordability is a main concern these are also two of the best for cost wise. I will warn the shoe boxes have no elevator so it might be a struggle if you get hurt. But the shoe boxes do have a sink in the dorm which is surprisingly really convenient given you don't have to leave the room to brush teeth or do dishes.\n\nIf you're someone that likes to cook, the newer buildings definitely have better community kitchens. I loved gressette's kitchen is so open and I have lots of space to work with. The high rises kitchens are quite cramped and lacking but since freshman have unlimited meal plans unless you're a crazy dedicated chef or have a big passion don't worry too much about that. Also get a micro fridge if you're not on the floor with the hall microwave. \n\nIf you like a quieter area (except nowhere is quiet on home Game Days)  I'm not sure if Calhoun courts or Thornhill are available to freshmen but those are more apartment and less dorm style and you don't have hallways or anything but they are a little further away walking to things. \n\nIf you are interested in how much space you have I would say some of the \"nicer\" dorms aren't always the better dorms so definitely look at photos and floor plans. \n\nIf you're anything like life sciences, health and performing arts those classes are more towards the horseshoe than core campus so I'd recommend the high rises or Calhoun or Thornhill (whatever is available to freshmen). Business classes are closer to douthit.  Although depending on any dual enrollment or anything you may not have that many major specific classes freshman year anyway. \n\nI honestly love living on campus and I know all of my friends in different dorms have all had different experiences but overwhelmingly positive experiences. Of course nothing is perfect but I hope this information and what others have said is helpful.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m currently a junior, and based on what I\u2019ve heard from others my freshman year and those in the classes below me, somewhere in core campus is the way to go (mickel, gressette, holmes/mccabe). I lived in manning (the only all-girls dorm) and I didn\u2019t mind it, but the communal bathrooms were sort of inconvenient (but definitely always super clean). I\u2019ve heard not the best things about the shoeboxes bc they\u2019re the oldest on campus I\u2019m pretty sure, but they are the cheapest if that\u2019s something you\u2019re taking into consideration. Both dining halls are decent so that doesn\u2019t really matter all that much, but core is closer to the stadium if that matters to you. Also, core dorms, you have a rooommate and suite mates, so you\u2019re only sharing a bathroom with three other people. Plus, the core campus dorm rooms are bigger and just a little bit nicer. Hope this helps!",

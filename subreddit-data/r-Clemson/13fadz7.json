It's absolutely crammed in there, but if you're looking for like-minded peeps to potentially make friends with, I'd say that's definitely the way to go. \n\nOtherwise, if you're just looking for better living conditions, Douthit 100% of the way. Core Campus is a close 2nd, but that's only for honors if I recall correctly. 3rd is definitely highrises.",

            "comment": "As someone who had friends in various residence halls and seen the conditions of most buildings but also the community in the buildings, it really depends on what you value most. \n\nDo you want a residence hall closest to where your classes are? For the most part freshman year classes are going to be all over the place. If you've got a decent amount of AP or dual enrollment credits, I'd recommend looking at where your building is in relation to where your classes may be, but classes and and will be put wherever there is space so don't use just this one thing. \n\nGoing to put a plug in for living learning communities if it's not too late (If so I'd still ask in case some of them still have space). The people you are around matter a lot more than the building itself. Finding a major based or identity based llc you like will definitely change your experience. As an LGBTQ+ student, living in lavender place let me have a welcoming space to come back to in a otherwise pretty chaotic campus. Especially if you're nervous about making friends an LLC gives you some form of connection between other people you're living with and around. \n\nSecond, what kind of experience do you want? Are you a football fan? Will you value being closer to the stadium? Are you a sports fan in general, I'd reccomend anything in core then (Mickel, gressette, Holmes McCabe, honors). But don't be deterred from the area if you're not sportsy. You don't have to deal with it a whole lot (mostly just interrupts you on home game days for a little while but a great time to do laundry) and all of campus becomes a tailgate space anyway. \n\nDo you care about coed/vs gendered floors? Gressette and I'm pretty sure douthit and possibly Holmes/McCabe the floors are not gendered because there's either gender neutral wet core (hallway but pretty private feeling) or suite rooms. The high rises (manning/Lever) are separated by floor and then Barnett if anything is available (it's mostly Greek rooms) is all female. \n\nDo you care more about \"niceness\" or affordable? Douthit and Gressette are nicer residence halls but the price tag also reflects that. The shoeboxes and some highrises are more affordable but you trade off for it in things like community kitchen size and community space. \n\nAre you planning on being in your room 24/7 or are you planning on being involved and busy. That also may play into what you're wanting in your space. If you want a space to be in all the time you may prefer one of the nicer residence halls. \n\nOne more thing on bathrooms. Maybe the hall style freaks you out, i would not pick a residence hall solely on that. There are benefits to this style as you don't have to clean it yourself and there's plenty available so you aren't locked to 1:4 ratio. \n\nI honestly don't think you can go wrong with where you live. Even the residence halls that people talk bad about have great community feeling. And you're living there for one year. \n\nGood luck deciding!",

Openly walked by them carrying beer a few times and they would respond with asking when they can swing by to chill",

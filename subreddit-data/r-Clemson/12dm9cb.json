What are some of the things you\u2019ve experienced dining on campus, and what have been your biggest challenges?",

I lived at Douthit and they had a \u201cNo using your meal plan to sustain nutrients on the weekends\u201d policy. The only dining hall open was core from Friday at like 7pm until Sunday night. So If I wanted I had to walk a mile while hungover to get reheated mediocre food.",

            "comment": "I had the same thought process of never wanting to work in the food industry, but frankly that's mostly what you'll find. People come and go a bunch in the food industry, so if you stay around then it's a steady gig. Pay is decent, but the positive is the leniency in hours and days off. If you only wanna work weekends, then food is best; they need the most help on the weekends. Also food industry is beneficial for your social skills- high stress, but you still have to be nice AND you only ever talk to strangers with the exception of the ~10% regulars.",

That also means it\u2019s a closed major and one of the harder majors on campus to get. This person would have to apply to get into the school once they complete the bridge program, similar to someone switching majors into nursing.",

I don\u2019t know the statistics on this but it is probably the hardest major to get into on campus to be real with you due to the nature of the program. Is it impossible? Definitely not, people still do transfer into the program.",

It\u2019s not gonna be easy to switch majors since it\u2019s a highly competitive closed major. \n\nI\u2019d honestly talk to an admissions counselor about it before you make a decision. \n\nI\u2019d also suggest since nursing in general is highly competitive due to the number of slots if you got in directly to a nursing program elsewhere like say USC I\u2019d probably go that route. \n\nBridge kinda sucks for people who want to do closed majors like Architecture or Nursing.",

I had to do a full year of undeclared before they would let me into my major. I had 2 friends who tried to get into nursing from the bridge, and neither  got in. Its competive so you better bring you A game if that it you plan A. This was 2009 though \ud83e\udd37",

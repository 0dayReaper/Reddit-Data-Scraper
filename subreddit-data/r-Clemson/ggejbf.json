When I initially started the program, I anticipated the program would take me 3 years but a professor recommended I extend my plan by a year so that I could have ample time to work through course work, publishing, presenting at conferences, dissertation proposal, and all of the other stages of a dissertation. \n\nIn hindsight, this was really good advice. However, I know the average length of time for a PhD is 4 - 7 years (in most programs; though I suppose you could totally do one in 3).",

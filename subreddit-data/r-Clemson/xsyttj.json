Don't let the cons bug you though, if you end up going to Clemson, you'll have a great time.",

There's pretty wide roads and parking lots in the middle of campus and every day there are cargo trucks and commuter/employee cars driving around searching for a parking spot, even in the middle of campus. You can technically walk everywhere but it's not a very pleasant experience. This combined with the miserable heat at the beginning and end of the year, and the lack of shade. If you don't have a car, getting groceries or doing anything off campus other than going to main street is tedious.\n\nBeing on this campus has exponentially increased my hatred for car centric infrastructure/urban design.",

However, when I graduated, I think the admin was in the process of beginning construction projects to narrow some of the roads and to decrease car traffic through campus. They were also keeping a lot of the roads through campus closed during class time. I think they are trying to make the campus more walkable.",

Buildings meet ADA guidelines but that\u2019s it for campus accessibility. So many hills it would be very difficult to navigate in a wheelchair,etc. Also buildings are very stair-heavy and there\u2019s usually only 1 elevator per building. 2) lacks diversity which makes sense bc clemson is not the most accepting place. There are definitely groups that are very inclusive, but overall Clemson is not a great place to be LGBTQ+, a person of color, disabled, etc. 3) dining hall food is meh 4) parking",

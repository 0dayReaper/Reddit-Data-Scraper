    "postText": "Hey guys, I hope you are doing great! I am looking for someone to take over my lease at 217 Cochran rd. It is a studio; I pay 570 monthly and it has water included. I can say that is a good place to live, quiet, pretty close to campus and the cat bus stops in front of the building. In this link you can see some more details: https://tigerprop.appfolio.com/listings/detail/d7cde9e5-ce6a-404d-b3ed-547b39cbe442\nDM if you are interested!",

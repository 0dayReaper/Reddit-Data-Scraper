That is, we had 2 classes in between the exams. 2. 2 lectures. \n\nExam 2 covered what? OH YEAH! All that shit that the professor canceled class over. 4 lectures worth of stuff we haven't covered at that point shoved on the exam. That exam alone ruined my chance at an A. \n\nIn another attempt to get that A back, I spent 4 nights (all night) working on a project to get 10 points of extra credit. I was told an A would exempt the exam for me but of course it didn't. The professor went and changed the 10 Ex1/10 Ex2/10 Activities/20 Final/50 Projects grade scale to 10 Activities/40 All exams/50 projects grade scale without changing the syllabus or notifying students. So not only did I do the project to get that A and spent well over 50 hours working on it that week, I also wasted my time worrying about 10 points when I could have been studying for the final.\n\nThe shit sucks. Yes I'm bitter.",

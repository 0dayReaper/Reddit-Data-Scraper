If anyone has a box they're trying to get rid of or knows that the school tosses some, I'd like to reuse it before going out and buying some. Thanks!!",

If you go to a used tire shop they would have dead tires you can get for free, get three of them, cut doorways through them and stack them over each other with two pieces of cardboard separating them and a nice tarp on top. Put some hay in there and now my friend you got a cat hotel.",

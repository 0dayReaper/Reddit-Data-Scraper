    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am a continuing student looking for off-campus housing for the 2023-2024 academic year.  I looked for off-campus housing last year at the end of July but almost all spots in all apartments near campus were occupied.\n\nDoes anyone know if these apartments tend to have vacancies at the end of Spring semester?  I'm looking into off-campus housing as a backup plan in case on-campus housing space runs out before my room selection time.",

Demand is pretty high around Clemson, so if you want something that you prefer (and not just what's available) you'd do well to constantly be on the lookout until you have something secured. Bonus being that once you find a place you like, you'll have a better idea of cost comparisons around the area and how good of a deal it is.",

    "postText": "hey guys! i am in a rut and i really don't know what to do. this is my last resort as someone told me that they found a sublease here. tldr: i cant seem to find anyone to take over my sublease for nuts\n\nfull context: i am an exchange student from overseas. i arrived in clemson last aug, and i was only to be here for 5 mths, till dec 2022. signed a year-long lease with University Village as signing a half-year lease would mean that i have to pay an additional $200/mth, and everyone told me that it would be very easy to find a sublease to take over my lease. posted regularly on clemson off-campus housing FB page, had a lot of leads but they KEPT falling through despite them showing strong interest at the start. other friends found subleasers easily even though it was the exact same kind of apartment in UV, so now it is just me who is back in my home country, left with an empty room and no one to take over the lease, and I'm still paying the rent until i find someone. UV refuses to help me even though i am in a very very tight financial situation, with tons of student loans and family problems too. this issue has been making me sleepless and i am constantly stressing over this and how to pay it off, so this is my last resort. if u have any leads or tips please let me know.. \n\nanyway here is the listing that i have posted everywhere on facebook. i hope this does not get flagged/removed because i really dont know what to do anymore\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\* JAN AND FEB RENT PAID FOR, WILL PAY YOUR $205 APPLICATION FEE TOO \\*\\*\\*\n\n4 beds 4 bathrooms \u2013 Townhouse Lease Takeover\n\n121 University Village Drive, Central, South Carolina 29630\n\nHi everyone! I am looking for a **female** to take over my sublease at University Village ASAP. My roommates are all clean and quiet girls. You can move in anytime from now and I am leaving behind all my furniture because I won\u2019t be able to bring them home. UV is only a 7 mins drive to campus and the busstop is right behind this apartment. Please contact me here or email me at shinolyys@gmail.com :) Thank you so much!",

It\u2019s much easier to find someone and that way you\u2019re left with half the amount to pay back. \n\nI remember having to do the same thing back in my day.",

Do you or your parents have the money saved? If you\u2019re taking this in loans just think that every 30k you borrow will be about $300 a month for 10+ years. Look at the crazy cost of rent, salaries etc and imagine how taking a huge chunk out for student loans will impact you.",

If I had significant debt, I don\u2019t think I would be able to live comfortably for a LONG time. I would hate to spend my young adulthood doing nothing but paying down school debt.\n\nIt sounds like OP wants to go to Clemson for the experience, same as a lot of other OOS 18 year olds. Having a wonderful college experience is certainly ideal, but there is SO much more to life than undergrad. I would encourage everyone making a decision like this to think about the advantages of low student debt - nicer apartment in the future, money for travel and hobbies, etc.",

My groups on Facebook etc are full of young professionals who took on debt of 50-200k of debt for an SLP degree. It\u2019s so incredibly sad. They are drowning and really struggling. With rent easily over 2000 a month in many places and cost of living so high student loan payments are debilitating. There are a lot of ways to make your time in undergrad \u201cfun\u201d and rewarding. Study abroad, cool internships, etc. 4 years goes by in a flash. My time at Clemson was great but I wouldn\u2019t say it was the best 4 years in my whole life ;)",

I was in your situation it depends on how much you or your parents or whoever are covering. Like if it was something like engineering agriculture or business I would say probably yes but as a nursing major you are going to get a job you really like regardless of where you went for undergrad.\n\nThe nursing program here is fantastic and is why I commit but it is not worth going into 200k of debt. I love it here and really enjoy it but at the end of the day whether you go to Clemson, any of the USCs or anything you\u2019re likely still going to get the same job yk?\n\nI don\u2019t know your exact situation financially but I pay the sticker price with no financial aid so $54,000 for tuition and housing and I live in the cheapest dorm. If that\u2019s doable then yes but if not I would go somewhere else and just know that you\u2019re going to have a successful career no matter what thanks to the need for smart nurses at every hospital.\n\nGood luck!",

They discuss how it\u2019s determined during your initial application process. It also has a reference to SC Regulation 62-605 that reads like you can\u2019t move instate after being out of state and swap to instate residency. It also describes the decision as Clemson\u2019s and it\u2019s a holistic review. All of these add up to don\u2019t plan to come thinking you\u2019d only have to pay OOS the first year and instate the others. I don\u2019t know. You might. I\u2019d bet they make it real difficult.",

I did it because I dropped out and worked in SC, then decided to go back with 5 years of leases, car registrations, etc. Clemson is not a fan of it in the sense of doing it just for tuition, you have to have another reason",

The ROI for an out of state nursing degree is not great.",

You will get the same job. Id look at florida nursing schools my cousin chose USF as its out of state was only 15 she got 5 in scholarship so then she got a traditional college with football but only paid 10 a year",

Keep in touch with your friends (and hang out with them post college) either because you like them or to network. Remember you don\u2019t have to stay at your first job. Or your second. Find a job that\u2019s tolerable and provides a good quality of life. The best is yet to come! And make sure you come back to Clemson often. If you wait ten years it will be a completely different university. Congratulations!",

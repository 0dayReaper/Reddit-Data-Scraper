    "postText": "When are final grades due? Literally all of my professors have yet to put the last few grades in, even though all of my classes have been done since last Tuesday. I\u2019m a senior and will be applying for grad school as soon as my grades are final and my GPA is updated. I understand professors have a lot on their hands right now, and I don\u2019t want to bother them during this hectic time. Anyone know when grades are due?",

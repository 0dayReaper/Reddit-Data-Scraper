I saw on the course list for summer 2022 they offered CPSC 2120 in the summer along with the lab, and I just wanted to know if any one had done it before, and if it was feasible. \n\nI know this is a notorious class, so it would be the only one I would take during the summer, and it would have my full attention.",

            "comment": "Speaking as a TA for 2120, I would recommend taking it during a spring or fall session when there is lots of support for you as a student.\n\n2310, 2150 and 2120 can be tough together but students have done it and been successful. I believe 2310 is usually offered in the summer so that may be an option",

Very little coding but a lot of concepts about documenting your code.\n\nIf you other courses are sleeper courses as well then this really isn't that bad. If you can take a 4 credit cpsc course with a 4 credit calculus course like I assume you have done already then this will be similar in workload",

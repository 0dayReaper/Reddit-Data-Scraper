And how hard is it to be accepted into? I missed the deadline to apply earlier this year and my tour guide made the honors college sound really good. Any feedback to help me make this decision would be greatly appreciated.",

I did spend nearly all my time in Holmes in my best friends dorm since she was in the honors college and I stayed off campus. It was nice but not like way better but I\u2019m pretty sure Holmes is no longer the honors college dorm. Good god that was just 11 years ago for me. Now I feel old haha",

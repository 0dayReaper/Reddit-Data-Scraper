As the game starts at 3:30pm, it should end around 6, and I believe that doesn\u2019t affect pier/downtown weekend bus. There are no posted announcements for the pier bus either, and there always have been. I\u2019d say that\u2019s sufficient to say the pier/downtown bus will run as scheduled (I believe it starts around 8?)",

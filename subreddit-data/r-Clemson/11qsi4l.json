    "postText": " \n\nHello! I am a student in PSYC 3100 (Advanced Experimental Psychology) and am collecting data for a class research project on the similarity of certain personality traits between close friends and whether these personality traits are associated with academic performance. I am looking for anyone who is willing to volunteer their time to participate in our anonymous online survey. You will be answering questions relating to your personality, a friend\u2019s personality, and your academic performance at Clemson University. The survey should take you about 5 minutes to complete. Your help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\u00a0\n\nTo start the study and/or check out more details about what it\u2019s all about, click on this link:\u00a0\n\n[https://clemson.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_cNK02CSaPgNK4w6](https://clemson.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cNK02CSaPgNK4w6) \n\nQuestions or concerns? You can contact my instructor, Dr. Limber at slimber@clemson.edu\u00a0",

            "comment": "I'm a CS Major, and although I didn't opt into RISE, I lived in a RISE dorm most of freshman year (Byrnes), and talked to plenty of people in it and still have no clue what its about. Best advice imo is to just go for the generally well regarded dorms. Holmes, Mickel, and McCabe (suite style rooms) are generally the first to fill up and the most desirable. Douthit is nice, but quite far from the rest of campus and expensive. If you have to, Byrnes &amp; Lever aren't a bad choice since they have good proximity to the Math and Physics buildings, and also a dining hall nearby. Would avoid the shoeboxes if you can.",

Calhoun Courts may also be an option, so I\u2019d look into that if you\u2019re interested in a more apartment style living (although you\u2019ll still share a bedroom as a freshman).",

You can watch football games from some of the Mickel Hall lounges, and west facing rooms. \n\n[RISE - Mickel Hall](https://housing.clemson.edu/community/rise-residents-in-science-and-engineering/)",

It is a lot of engineering majors which is a good thing academically but socially it can be tough as we all know the stereotypes around engineering majors, and there\u2019s always some truth to stereotypes. If you\u2019re looking to go out and party on the weekends I highly recommend not doing RISE. If you\u2019re not into that then it would probably be a good idea. Atleast in my experience, barely anyone on my entire floor went out and did anything on the weekends so it was tough to find a good group of people to go out with for a while. (Not trying to shit on engineering majors, I am a ME major. I\u2019m just sharing my experience with it and wanted to help.)",

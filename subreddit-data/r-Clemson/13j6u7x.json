            "comment": "40/hrs a week shouldn't be an issue if it's one asynchronous class.  My class followed a book that was a fair amount of reading but the assignments were a progression of a single semester-long project.  Essentially you pick a topic after a few short writing assignments and it devolved into some weird \"social media\" and \"video\" projects.\n\nIt might have been one of those weird \"alternative\" learning test classes but it was easy.  I somehow got that style twice for my English 1030 and 3140.",

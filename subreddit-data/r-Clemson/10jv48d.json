    "postText": "Man I hate making a post like this cause they are just so common and annoying on these college subreddits, but I just toured Clemson today and it just felt like my home, I loved it so much. Like it just felt perfect to me, literally I have toured so many schools and this one just had everything I ever wanted in a college, personally. Anyway, I am currently an in state student applying for mechanical engineering, I have a 4.34 weighted GPA (3.5 unweighted), took loads of honors classes that I can\u2019t even count at the moment, as well as 7 AP courses. I also got a 1260 SAT score(640 math, 620 reading), a really good resume with lots of extra curricular activities listed,  a really good essay, and a great letter of recommendation from my math teacher who taught me for most of high school. Like I feel like I have good chances to go to Clemson but I just need some reassurance for the next month, cause I can\u2019t stop thinking about this acceptance letter now that I love this school so much\ud83d\udc80. So, are my chances good?",

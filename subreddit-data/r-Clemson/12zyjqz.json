Every Wednesday at 7pm EDT (UTC \u22124:00 hours) I have an interactive live stream on general chemistry topics. This week we are working through three thermodynamics problems. We will calculate \u0394H\u2070, \u0394S\u2070, and \u0394G\u2070. Feel free to ask questions in the chat and request other chemistry topics/problems for future live streams.",

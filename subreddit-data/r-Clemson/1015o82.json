The venue makes it easier since they handle door/ID/alcohol sales and you just have to promote and provide the music (then hassle w/ the owner about getting paid, but that's its own thing). \n\nIf you're doing it as a true house party (not at a venue) keep in mind that a few shitheads can ruin everything, and cops will respond to noise complaints and ID folks outside / use weed smell as an excuse to search the venue. So CYA and probably test noise complaints at the house beforehand by having a smaller party, then at the actual event don't provide alcohol, stop folks from hanging out outside, don't have any drugs in the house, etc. \n\nBest wishes and thanks for considering providing music and events. It's often a thankless pain in the ass, but it makes things a lot more fun.",

I'm not personally into house music much but if you're looking for DJs I do know a guy who played at the grove's rave night and he's really talented",

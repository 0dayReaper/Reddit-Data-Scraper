If you\u2019re looking for a higher level language that lines up better with English, go for 1060. Generally, most CS majors start with 1010 and go from there. \n\nI\u2019ve heard good and bad things about both, depending on professor. There\u2019s an unofficial discord for the CS department where you can connect with other people in your class as well as upperclassmen, so whatever you take you\u2019re not SOL on resources.\n\nIf you have more questions, the schedule help channel in the discord might be your best bet.",

Both 1010 and 1060 probably get into the same complexity but at least you won\u2019t have to do extra studying on your own for all the C functions and what they really do. The only downside is that if OP is a Comp Sci major then taking the 1060/1070 route only benefits them for 2150 where they\u2019ll use Java for the last time. C/C++ are the favored language and are required for CPSC 2310 and CPSC 2120 which are two of the three in what I like to call \u201cthe weed out trio\u201d. I think OP might be better off taking the 1010/1020 route and learning Java when they have to go to 2150.",

When I took it, a considerable portion of the class were non compsci, and only taking it to fulfill their requirement",

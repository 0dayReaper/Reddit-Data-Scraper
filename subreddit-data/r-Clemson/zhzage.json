            "comment": "For anyone following this, I called their hep desk today.  There was a server side issue causing the FASFA form data not to be stored, resulting in the error.  \n\nThe resolution is to create a new FAFSA for 2023-2024 using the Start Over button and entering the data again.  The Continue option will not work, as there is no data in the system to be retrieved, once you get past the student demographics information.  I think for me it errored on the page that displays high school information.\n\nThere was a maintenance window on Sunday to apply a patch to fix this issue.  I've confirmed I'm able to create a new form and resume or edit as needed, and the data is retained.  It is working as expected again.\n\nGood luck to all.",

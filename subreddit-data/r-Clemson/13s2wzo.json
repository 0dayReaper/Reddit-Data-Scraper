And after that the interiors are being turned into study rooms. \n\nHowever, I had a friend there this year and its not the best. She had no outlets on her side of the room at all and it wasn\u2019t very helpful circadian rhythm wise. The interiors are also right next to the elevator and it\u2019s harder to sleep at night there. She was late several times because of the lack of windows that let light in to keep your circadian rhythm correct. The only positive was that there was a sink in there.",

It\u2019s only interior single rooms. And there isn\u2019t any information available so I guess that\u2019s what they are renovating.",

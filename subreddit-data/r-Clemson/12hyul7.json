I\u2019m an international student and will be moving to pursue my PhD so I literally know no one. \n\nI\u2019m also looking for housing so if anyone needs a roommate (female) hit me up! \n\nIf there are no groups yet I\u2019ll create one, so let me know in the comments if you\u2019d like to join.",

If you think you'll get a C anyway then sure, pass is basically the same. Freshmen taking entry level courses would probably be fine taking passes, but upperclassmen taking important courses shouldn't go for a pass if they're looking at doing grad school in the future.\n\nYou may still get in, but you wouldn't be a top candidate compared to people who took the same classes but have high letter grades versus your pass grade. That can be the difference between scholarships and fellowships as well \n\nAlso, depending on the field, some jobs may actually care too. Like if you're interesting in following an economics career in mathematical analysis, then econometrics is the key class to have as part of your history. A lot of entry-level jobs will actually ask to see that you've taken it, and again there, a pass is not as good as an A or B. That's fairly rare though, but still worth considering.",

And people who don't take that option will look a little better for grad schools than people who do.\n\nIt's not a major game changer but is something to think about. The option is there for people who are suddenly going to do worse than they expected to do because of the switch to online. It's not meant to be a free pass like OP is using it as. Like, it's fine to do that of course, but before using it as a free pass to slack off, it's probably worth considering your own individual situation. And the main situation where going with p/f is bad is for people who are thinking of grad school, like the commenter said.",

I'd question it if I we're a manager, usually transcripts show when the credits we're completed.\n\nThey will ask you would you quit doing your job and not work remotely? I'm just telling you, managers think 100% different then you. \n\nWhile you might be able to explain that to a 25 year old guy, a 47 year old manger might think a little different. \n\nA job interview in a sense is a competition. Instead of explaining why you got P/PF, I'd rather hire the guy who got all As and Bs and persevered through it.\n\nI don't mind or care, I'm just telling you someone 8 years down the road if you're wanting to go to grad school later might not care about the pandemic from today. \n\nDon't doubt the fact that SOMEONE will pull out As and Bs through this, and that might be the deciding factor of someone hiring you or them.\n\nI'd be more understanding for a college freshman doing it (all core courses) I as an employer would want to know why out of 12-18 credit hours your senior year, you couldn't get one A or B in the classes that are for your career.\n\nIt's a reasonable question, and playing video games for 30 days is not worth having to answer it 30 times. Grad school and some career lines ask why you got a C, they sure as hell are going to ask why you took 4-5 pass fails your last semester of college.\n\nI don't expect you to get As and Bs across the board, but I'd like to see at least the fact you got 2-3. If you got 5 Pass grades in letter grade classes... That tells me you're not good at your career line, and you will not excel over a candidate that took letter grades.\n\nIf you can't succeed through hard times in college classes, how can I trust you with a $50,000 position starting out in hard times?\n\nI consistently get TDed on here and I don't really care. Taking advice from college students (myself included) on how this will effect hiring standards is not a good idea.\n\nCollege is a marathon, I'm not trying to score a whole second less then someone else.",

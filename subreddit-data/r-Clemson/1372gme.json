            "comment": "Hey so I thought I\u2019d share my situation here. I\u2019m a sophomore engineering student at Clemson and I applied for the co-op program here. I was able to arrange interviews with tons of companies and at the start of the process I didn\u2019t actually want to co-op I just wanted interview experience. Because of that, I applied for companies that asked for 3.0 or above grades. My gpa is a whopping 2.6. I by no means qualified for at least 90% of the companies I applied to. I got an offer from every company. The way gpa works on resumes for most companies is as a filter for the applicants. When the time comes to fill the job that everyone applied for the company takes all the applicants gpas and just lets the top 1/3 or so get past the filter. That\u2019s it you get no ability to interview or anything you just end up on the chopping room floor as a statistic. I found this out the hard way applying for internships. However if you can get to a point where you interview or interact with someone, your gpa can be forgotten for your abilities in the interview. That\u2019s why co-ops were so great for me. They guaranteed me interviews which then gave me a platform to talk about my gpa and justify why the company needs me. At the end of the day I\u2019d say a gpa is critical for internships (as most companies don\u2019t take people unless an applicant is amazing) and gpa is less important for jobs or co-ops so long as you can interview. Also if you have a sub par gpa like me apparently LinkedIn is paramount to getting interviews.",

                    "comment": "Thanks for sharing this. So many people overlook the interview as an important part of the \"getting a job\" process. It does actually require some amount of skill to come across to the potential employer as the person with the skills and abilities you think you are portraying. This can be practiced.\n\nI have had the opportunity to talk with companies hiring teams that have surveyed candidates that didn't make it to see where the disconnects were. A lot of times the hiring manager perceived the person as not wanting the job, not clearly communicating their goals with the company, or a lack of understanding of the company's business. But when asked, the candidate suggested they tried to convey all that.\n\nIts a little ironic that the door between a graduate and a job is ignored especially considering there are probably at least 20 other people trying to get in that same door.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI have an international flight from Atlanta on 3rd of May and I'm looking to split an Uber with someone to save on transportation costs. My flight is at 8.30 pm and I need to be at the airport no later than 4:30 pm.\n\nI'm located in Clemson and I'm flexible on the pickup location as long as it's within a reasonable distance. If you're also traveling to the airport around the same time and interested in sharing the cost of an Uber, please let me know.\n\nA little about me: I'm a male grad stundent at Clemson. I'm a friendly and respectful person, and I promise not to be late or hold you up in any way.\n\nIf you're interested, feel free to shoot me a message and we can coordinate the details. Looking forward to hearing from you!",

I\u2019ve attached screenshots (both for 1 way) that would work for you. \n\nI think your best option is to take the cheap (33 dollar) Amtrak to ATL, the station is near 17th street. You can walk from the station to (probably) Arts Center Marta station and then take MARTA to the airport (2.50 a way) and you\u2019ll be golden. MARTA takes you to the domestic side of things but that shouldn\u2019t be an issue if you\u2019re flying Delta or a delta partner. You can check in and bag drop on the domestic side. If however you are flying an international only airline there is a free shuttle that runs between the international terminal and domestic. All terminals all accessible behind security, connected by the plane train. \n\nIf you have questions feel free to DM me. Clemson grad, lived in Atlanta for 6 years now and platinum medallion with delta so I travel a fair amount lol [plane, then train. I would train](https://imgur.com/a/Xcq9iy3)",

I ended up taking Math 2080 thru gvl tech over the summer and I would suggest that for 1080 as well unless you\u2019re a calculus genius. PHYS 1220 is the easiest of those 3 classes in my opinion (I\u2019m a civil engineer tho) and if you\u2019re looking at taking 17 hours during the semester I would say take one of those classes over the summer if you can afford it",

I took it over the half summer session and it was very time consuming, but worth it. Daily notes were due for a grade everyday which kept you on track. Tests were online with a webcam and you would submit a pdf of your work while on the webcam before the testing time ended. I believe there were three exams and a final. I made an A and would attribute it to the way the course was run. Also from what I\u2019ve heard an A is very uncharacteristic for most everyone else\u2019s experiences taking Calc 2.",

            "comment": "Currently taking both MATH 1080 (Prof Shih-Wei Chao) and PHYS 2210 (Dr. Brown) online through Clemson for Summer A. I\u2019m taking 2 more additional classes over Summer B, but since they haven\u2019t started yet/aren\u2019t the classes you asked about I\u2019ll just talk about Summer A.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor MATH 1080, we have 5-6 topics we learn each week, with 1-3 lecture videos for each one. Chao has a set of guided lecture notes that he gives us, so I just fill them while watching the videos on YouTube. Each week we have an exam (all MCQ- there was a FRQ section on the practice exam at the beginning of the class but nothing was set up on Gradescope so I think he\u2019s abandoned that), and we have to submit our notes and do Learning Assesments for each topic. Those are Canvas quizzes (again, all MCQ) with unlimited attempts, so there\u2019s no reason why you shouldn\u2019t be getting 100% on all of them. A good deal of the exam problems come from our notes, practice problems (Chao also gives us practice problems for each lecture note, but these aren\u2019t graded) and previous exams (can be found on the [MATH 1080 website)](https://mthsc.clemson.edu/ug_course_pages/view_course_page/8), and are carried out through Canvas via Lockdown Browser. While the class averages for the exams hover around a F/D, Chao has given us opportunities to improve our exam scores, with a make-up exam for Exam 1 and Exam 3 corrections. Overall, this class is not as difficult as others have made it out to be (and trust me when I say this, as I was never the brightest math student and still struggle with the basics from time to time).\n\nThe next class is Physics II with Dr. Brown. People say that he is the best professor for the introductory physics classes, and I could not agree more. For each chapter, he gives us lecture notes (essentially a PDF of all you need to know for that chapter) and also has lecture videos for us to watch as well. Similar to his in-person classes, we have a Top Hat Course Pack for each chapter (7 MCQ questions, 2 attempts each) and Expert TA HW due as well (less problems than The assigns- still would recommend getting Cheng for them though). We only have 2 midterms (Thermo, most of electrical stuff) and a final, and honestly they have not been too hard so far. We also have a discussion post due for each chapter, where we have to identify an old exam problem and say why it involves concepts from the particular chapter. So if you work through the old exams (he posted all of them from 2010*ish* onwards) and watch his exam review video, you should be fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo more things while I\u2019m at it. Summer courses will factor into the GPA calculations that will determine scholarship and engineering-major declaring. So don\u2019t worry if you cannot declare your major right now. If you don\u2019t end up getting the required grades to attain the GPA necessary for declaring your major, you can always appeal to the department head (your advisor should have emailed you with steps on how to do this). However the scholarship requirements are much more set in stone, so I would make a plan and determine what grades you need to keep them and make a consistent work schedule each day.",

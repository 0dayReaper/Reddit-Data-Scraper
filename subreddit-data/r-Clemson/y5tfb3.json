    "postText": "I'm unsure of where I'm going to live next year (freshman currently), I might be getting a job where I can get guaranteed on-campus which I would prefer (not an RCM, but please don't ask as I would prefer to keep my identity private), but it's not certain that I will get it. \n\nA large part of why I would want to live on campus is the closeness as I don't have a car and I'm in some clubs that go after the CatBus route ends (at least I've heard, never had to use it). I heard the housing lottery is hard to get and I've heard others already applying to off-campus places, so I'm scared if I wait until the lottery I might not find a place to live. \n\nAre applications binding, i.e. can I apply to multiple places/cancel if I do get a place on campus? And where/when should I apply if I would like to live somewhere that meets these conditions?",

I\u2019m pretty sure more spaces in Calhoun courts will be allocated to freshman due to the renovation of Byrnes next year, so it\u2019ll be even harder to get Douthit west. Also it\u2019s overpriced and you\u2019re basically paying for location (experience: I currently live here) \n\nDaniel Square, Wyatt, and University Ridge all fill up instantly so I doubt they\u2019ll be any space left but you can always check. Places downtown like Earle, Ucentre, etc. also do as well and are expensive, but not as fast. \n\nI agree with Crawford falls, also checkout out grandmarc and Tillman place. Both are near falls and are pretty walkable. I would invest in a bike/ bike share ($15 a year) for reliable transportation after bus routes/ private shuttles aren\u2019t running.",

Both harts and crawford were similar prices. Also, i\u2019d try your best to get an apartment managed by Tiger Properties\u2026 they weren\u2019t perfect but far and away better than my experiences with other property managers",

There is a non refundable application fee. (some places will wave it if you ask) you should know kinda quickly if you\u2019ve been accepted so I wouldn\u2019t apply to more than 2 at a time.\n\nMany places have their own buses that may work for your schedule. I would check out Signature Hartwell, they have a bus and I think they are still filling spaces. It\u2019s somewhat walkable as well. Avoid any apartments that are still being built. They will not be ready by next year.",

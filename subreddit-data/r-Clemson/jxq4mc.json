Clemson is such an amazing school I am so honored to be receiving a degree from here! I remember so many stressful, tear-filled days where I didn't think I was good enough or smart enough to finish, but I'm so glad I stuck around. Thanks to CAPS for being there for me when I was spiraling downwards. To the students who were literally all. so. nice. and helpful.  I have so much respect for you. If you're considering grad school at clemson, you won't regret it should you decide to persue it.  I am SO proud to be a Clemson tiger!! \n\nCheers \ud83d\udc05",

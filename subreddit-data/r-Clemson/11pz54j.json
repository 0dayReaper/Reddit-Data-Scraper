Sure, everyone has their \u201cleanings\u201d (politically, religiously, etc.), but at the end of the day we all want the same thing: for us to do and be the very best we can individually and collectively. \n\nContrary to the message of division being shoved down everyone\u2019s throats by the MSM etc., people are not *nearly* as divided irl as many are led to believe. Be the change you want to see and remember: we have two ears and one mouth for a reason. \n\nIf I may add one note, I\u2019ve learned two coexisting truths in life:\n\n1.) This world is incredibly big with something new to learn each day if we will simply learn to listen.\n\n2.) This world is incredibly small and we are all so intimately connected to one another through our thoughts, choices and actions. \n\n\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude4f",

            "comment": "Not really the question asked, but you seem to be looking at Clemson University for your undergraduate degree, so I will relate my experience:\n\nI don't think I was ever in a situation where my political affiliation or religious beliefs came up as a topic for discussion, debate, or conflict point inside or outside the classroom. Inside the classroom is is generally a thought experiment, no judgement. Outside, well, if you are talking about these things outside the classroom and getting conflict with people you just met, you may be in the wrong social circle.\n\nNo one really cares. Everyone has so much more to worry about to graduate.\n\nIf politics are your thing, there are student groups. I have been given a pamphlet by just about every major political ideology on campus.\n\nIf religion is your thing, there are student groups. I have been given a pamphlet by just about every major nonsecular ideology on campus.\n\nIf ethnic centered activities are your thing, there are student groups, etc. I have partied with just about every major ethnic group on campus, sadly I have only really been involved formally with one.\n\nVary rarely do these things \"collide\" in a way that affects students who don't prioritize the things other students are passionate about. This will be the experience for most students at most institutions. (Much to the chagrin of the passionate)\n\nDegrees of \"uncomfortableness\" will vary. You would have to provide more details about your personal tolerance for it. Some people may feel uncomfortable that \"Preacher Bob\" is allowed to shout bible stuff on campus. Some people may feel uncomfortable that far-right conservatives or MAGA republicans are vocal about their ideologies.\n\nDoes it suck that my school has a student organization that hosted an AA Bake Sale on the first day of Black History Month (and then said they didn't know)? Yes, but I kinda like the thought that extreme viewpoint holders decided to wear a sign so we can identify them and either keep our distance or cozy up, whatever floats our boat.\n\nTL,DR: There is something for everyone, if you don't like something, there is room enough for everyone.",

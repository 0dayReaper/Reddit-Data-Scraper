Jim Clements makes over $800k per year. If you don't believe me look it up. Clemson being a public university is required to post their numbers every year. \n\nThe University infrastructure doesn't require that much money. The University needs to trim the fat and budget themselves into a more efficient business just like everyone else.",

But as a student I firmly believe that the quality of education, services provided, and overall experience will undoubtedly decrease substantially without access to campus while the tuition will stay the same. \n\nFrom my point of view tuition is a payment for a good/service and while the quality of this good/service has diminished significantly price will remain unchanged.  I know universities do a myriad of other things, but to the majority of students tuition is simply the cost of them going to school, and they are less worried about the school completing research or fulfilling their mission statement.",

There are plenty of amazing educational resources available online or at tech schools for free or very cheap. What you\u2019re paying into is the school\u2019s reputation and network, both of which have been developed over generations of alumni. That is what your tuition dollars go to. Your resources and experience have already been paid for by the people who came before you. Your tuition dollars don\u2019t just go to things like utility bills and new buildings. They go to faculty research and study abroad grants and other programs that are designed to further enrich Clemson\u2019s reputation for future and current students. By demanding lower tuition for yourself, you lower the value of your degree now and in the future. Yes, online classes suck, and yes I would rather have the in-person experience I thought I was getting when I started paying my tuition. But I know what I\u2019m really paying for and I\u2019m ok with that. If you\u2019re not, then that\u2019s ok too. Nobody is forcing you to do that. Just know that there will be a line of people ready to take your spot.",

You're assuming that higher cost equates to a superior product, which given the history of college in general is completely false. I guarantee the experience of a clemson student in 1953 was just as rewarding at a fraction of the cost.",

I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s anything wrong with expecting public institutions to responsibly manage resources and hold down the costs of attendance. I also agree there more ways Clemson could achieve this. However, many of these changes would take time to come into effect, and very well may incur an upfront cost to implement. People want tuition to be reduced NOW, assuming Clemson is somehow operating on a diminished budget due to the absence of students on campus. This is simply not true. The costs of moving instruction online are very real. Reducing tuition will only hinder Clemson from making this transition, and yes, from further benefitting the school in the future. What was trying to say in my previous comment is that this stance that tuition is directly linked to the quality of education is misguided. You pay for your degree to say Clemson, not Tri-County Tech. Everything else is in consequence of that.",

They\u2019re a buisness so don\u2019t take pity on them they make billions of dollars i\u2019m pretty sure giving us our money for stuff we don\u2019t use is not breaking their bank. I think the issue here is them juggling budgetary and health of the students. While they were worried about making up a consent and agreement they should\u2019ve been considering all the options. That way it wouldn\u2019t have been a \u201cshock.\u201d Clemson closed down because of the rise in numbers. The numbers aren\u2019t going to drop their just going to remain going up yet they still try and convince us that we will come back in September. It\u2019s all a scam to reel us in. If they\u2019re that much in debt from reducing tuition then they need to shut down bc they not doing something rigjyb",

We have decreased herd sizes. But as Clemson does, we bought something really stupid and unnecessary-automatic milking for 200 cows (One of my classes made us go traditionally milk. Took about 2.5 hours and the workers 2/3 workers per shift make minimum wage). It\u2019s a multi million dollar piece of machinery and we are the only dairy farm on the east coast with one and the other farms that have it have well over 5000 to milk. And we have so many students in our program looking for jobs like that to have animal experience along with a little money. \nThings like this is why we have to pay for tuition and fees even when we can\u2019t use them IMO",

While I understand Clemson,  just like every other university, has experienced a lot of challenges during this pandemic. This by no means excuses the broad intellect CU/admin has infused us with. COVID-19 has affected millions across the world, including my closest family and friends. This is a very aggressive virus and deserves a very antagonistic call to action. Though, it seems Clemson can\u2019t kept their eye on the prize (the safety of its students) for juggling with budgetary.  The world has known about this pandemic sense the beginning of 2020. However, Clemson waited until weeks before our start of \u201cin-person\u201d classes to announce this oh so shocking news of remaining online. This did not come as a shock to Clemson, but to its students. Clemson gave false hope and is continuing to give false hope by not swallowing their pride. I\u2019m not sure if their hiding the vaccines in the hills of Clemson but unless they are...bummer. Clemson has not remained a family in all this in fact they showed they are not family oriented at all. Throughout the summer we\u2019ve received very little information from Clemson as far as what we\u2019re doing (Just small talk to get by).  However, they did have time to update their consent and agreement ;). The agreement is somewhat the same expect hmm no Tuition reduction in the case we remain online. This was exactly a week before they sent out the disappointing news of remaining online until September. Clemson has ruined the chances to transferring this semester and putting their students in a block. Give us more information you\u2019ve had all quarantine to think.",

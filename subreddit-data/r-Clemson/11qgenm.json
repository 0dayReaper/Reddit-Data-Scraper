    "postText": "Hey everyone! My name is Jith Vishwanath and I\u2019m a 5th year at Clemson. I\u2019m looking for some roommates for any place in Clemson that leases for about 400-550 a month! Currently looking at the Woodlands and University Village. Here\u2019re some of my interests and other things about me:\n\n-Playing games (I\u2019m not a loud gamer).\n-Making and listening to all types of music.\n-Hiking and free running! I\u2019ve begun my journey of fitness a little over a year ago and I\u2019m a lot happier than I\u2019ve ever been!\n-I\u2019m not much of a party person, but I don\u2019t mind if any roommates want to host one occasionally with some prior notice.\n-I\u2019m from Crestview, FL.\n-Open to most pets.\n-Willing to put in the work to keep the living space clean, would hope that any potential roommates would do the same.\n\nIf interested, please reach out to me! Would love to learn more about you regardless of whether or not we end up living together.",

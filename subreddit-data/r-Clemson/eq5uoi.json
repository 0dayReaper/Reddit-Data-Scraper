Oh, well we should run it!  ETN had some good runs, but overall, that defense was stifling. We did well to avoid fumbles (until the end).\n\nI'd rather take an overthrown pass 10/10 than lose a yard on a stuffed run, waste time on a ticking clock, or turn over a fumble.\n\nIf dude has any more hot coaching takes, just post them in r/cfb next time.\n\nEdit: while we're on it, the boosters bought ETN draft protection and that's fully legal. So, yeah. Makes more sense to spend another year smashing every rushing record known to the ACC (definite bc he only needs like 500 for all time) and getting a better draft slot especially considering how much less the NFL is after RB's now. That lifetime RB is a thing of the past. He's wanting to go first round to a decent team.",

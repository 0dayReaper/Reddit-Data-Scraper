It's unfortunate that your advisor isn't responding but in theory you could always make an appointment with them and ask any questions you had, regardless of if the general advising has started yet.",

This has worked for me 100% of the time.",

I\u2019ll stand by my statement as I see how some professors and advisors care vs others at least where I teach, and that matches what I hear from students across the country at diff schools.\n\nSome of it is the school setting up professors and advisors to fail. Others it\u2019s on them as they just don\u2019t want to spend the time to deal with it vs other aspects of their job.",

That is where you\u2019ll have to update your academic plan with the classes you plan to take (if I remember right it\u2019s just an Excel sheet you have to fill out). That canvas page is also where a lot of the instructions for doing the previous, getting your pin etc come from. \n\nIf they have gone back to faculty advisors for undergrad, don\u2019t expect an answer for up to a week from you advisor. If CJ is your advisor please be patient with her. I know it sucks not getting a quick response, but they are pulling her 1000 different directions down there on top of advising and everything else. Not defending the department\u2019s lack of focus on resources and advising among other things (I\u2019m look at you student lounge that possibly got taken away to be a classroom)",

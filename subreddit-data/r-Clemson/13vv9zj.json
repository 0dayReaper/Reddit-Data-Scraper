WSL2 is stupid easy to use, and is identical to the machines used to run your code. (i.e Ubuntu 20.04).  -- What's even more hilarious is that apple alias's /usr/bin/gcc to just use Clang if you have xcode installed. If you didn't know this and got a C assignment with specific GNU extensions (e.g any of these [https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/C-Extensions.html](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/C-Extensions.html)) It wouldn't compile, and you would be very confused.",

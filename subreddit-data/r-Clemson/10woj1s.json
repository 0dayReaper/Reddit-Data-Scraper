I am worried the job opportunities will be very limited and I haven\u2019t had many internship opportunities or availabilities that correlate with my major. I\u2019m thinking about attending law school (I have a few in mind that are particularly inexpensive, at least for law school), but I want to leave the south. I am extremely interested in the City of New York School of Law, but I\u2019m worried my degree won\u2019t hold weight coming from Clemson as we aren\u2019t a big political science school. I say that all to say, is there any political science seniors or alumni that have had success after Clemson in their degree? I honestly feel super unprepared for after graduation, need advice!",

There may be some instances where you\u2019d get a slight boost for going to Princeton or something but Clemson is plenty good enough. However, I wouldn\u2019t recommend going to CUNY if you have a desire to work at a large firm making $215k as a first year (prob more like $235k by time you\u2019d start) as they send less than 3% of their class to large firms. If you want to work in government or something it may be fine, but if the goal is a high paying job you\u2019ll need to go to a better law school. Feel free to PM with any other questions",

In some sense I think it\u2019s natural to feel unprepared for life after undergrad no matter what your major is, but I\u2019ve also been fearful of not having a career lined up or a clear career path post-undergrad in recent months. \n\nThat said, there are numerous jobs a political science major could go into without attending grad school or law school. Public education, government, non-profits, etc. \n\nBut as far as grad school/law school goes, Clemson is a respected university and your degree matters much less than your GPA and admissions test scores.",

Against ND, when they put Cade in he immediately threw an interception on the 10 yard line and ND scored a TD 1 or 2 plays later. Against South Carolina they didn\u2019t put him in the game at all. Against Syracuse, he came in and basically just handed the ball off the rest of the game. But he did provide an emotional spark. In every other game that Cade came in, he never showed at all that he was ready to be the guy. So for all these people that say we\u2019d be undefeated if Cade was starting, they have no clue what they\u2019re talking about because there was nothing at all during the season to show that would\u2019ve happened. Now, I\u2019m super glad that he came in and played the way he did, because it literally salvaged what was left of the season and now I think we actually have a chance to win the Orange Bowl.",

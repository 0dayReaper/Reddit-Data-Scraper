So let\u2019s get that out of the way first.\n\nWith that being said, Holmes and McCabe as well as mickel are the most popular suite style and will go fast. You should also look into Douthit and Gresette. They\u2019re hybrid bathrooms, so they\u2019re in the hallway but the doors lock and they\u2019re private. \n\nFor traditional community style, Byrnes will be down next year so that leaves you with maudlin and lever. They are what they are, but they aren\u2019t as terrible as people say. Nowhere is really.",

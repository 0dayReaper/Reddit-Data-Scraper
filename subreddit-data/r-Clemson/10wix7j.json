While these weren\u2019t internships per se, I did later do an internship in Shanghai with the US department of commerce (also did a faculty directed internship in the US at Clemson). Worked in international trade management consulting after graduating. \n\nProbably not the exact same as the program you\u2019re asking about, but I found the programs to be 100% worth it and super fun.",

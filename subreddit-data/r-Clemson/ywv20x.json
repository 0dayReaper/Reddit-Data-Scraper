We want to hear your story.\u201d \n\nBut, many people say I should write it anyways, even if I don\u2019t have an anomaly or whatever on my academic record. What do I do? Thank y\u2019all.

You can write about anything, even if it's just some fluff it looks better than nothing.",

I\u2019m saying their definition implies it being a source of clarification of any anomalous grades or classes, but if it truly is just writing about myself than that\u2019s fine. Just wanted to make sure I had the correct mindset/ understanding going into it. Thank you for your advice.",

I'm a big fan of playing basketball and I was wondering if anyone knows of any regular pickup games happening in and around Clemson?\n\nIf you know of any regular pickup games happening in the area, please let me know! Also, if anyone is interested in starting a regular pickup game, let's organize one!\n\nThanks!",

If you\u2019re lucky you\u2019ll find a group of like 20 people rotating games for hours at a time.",

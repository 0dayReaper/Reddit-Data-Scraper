    "postText": "Hello all, \n\nI\u2019m a new freshman at Clemson this fall from out of state in search of a good recommendation for a barber. I\u2019ve tried two in the downtown area, but have yet to find one that I\u2019m happy with. \n\nWhile I would prefer something within a 30 min walk as I don\u2019t have a car on campus, I\u2019m willing to find a ride if there is a good suggestion - just further away. \n\nThanks in advance for any recommendations, I\u2019m looking forward to trying them out",

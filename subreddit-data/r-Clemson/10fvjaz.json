Her and her roommates swear up and down that they see figures in their hallways and shot, and I'll say I've never seen it myself. \nHowever, the past few nights we've been staying up late in the commons to not bother our roommates, and we hear enough noise upstairs to think people are up there pacing, and whispering to each other.\nHas anyone else had any weird experiences, or are we hallucinating?",

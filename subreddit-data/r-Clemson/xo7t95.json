    "postText": "So my girlfriend is a Genetics Major at Clemson and is having a really hard time in her Genetics class with a really horrible professor and is afraid she may fail the class. She had to withdraw from Chem I last fall due to personal reasons as well as having a bad professor. If she were to withdraw from this Genetics class, would it count against her? And would subsequent withdrawals count as well? (Besides having to make up the credit hours to keep her scholarships.)",

You also get to be at Clemson when the lake is at its best. I spent 3 to 6 days a week on the lake with friends. The cops for some reason didn\u2019t care about people underage drinking at the lake either and when they caught a big group of us twice they just helped us clean up and sent us on our way. Very different then in the Fall or Spring.",

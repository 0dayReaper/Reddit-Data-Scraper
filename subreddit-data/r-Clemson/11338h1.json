    "postText": "Hello All!\n\nI am a graduate student here at Clemson. I took my undergraduate engineering courses at Clemson as well and received Cumme Laude and an honors bachelor's degree with a minor in Math. I have taken almost every undergraduate ME course available and I have never had lower than a B in any class. I'm not bragging, just establishing credibility. \n\nI have been tutoring for over 2 years now and I am looking for new students who need a private tutor. I give 1hr or longer private sessions for a fair price. I can tutor any of the following courses (and some others, just ask!):\n\nCalculus I, II, and III\n\nDifferential Equations\n\nIntro to ECE\n\nAll introductory engineering courses including MATLAB, and SolidWorks\n\nStatics and Dynamics (I did get an A in this course when I took it as an undergraduate)\n\nPhysics 1 and 2\n\nModeling Dynamic Systems\n\nMechanical System design\n\nHeat Transfer, thermodynamics, and Fluids (FYI, these are my weaker subjects, but I can still help you out!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave I convinced you yet? Message on Reddit or at my phone number to ask for a session: (843) 304-5654",

How do I get funding in forms of GA/TA/RA?\n\nWould really appreciate if the community here could help.",

He is really personable and could at least point you in the right direction if he doesn't have the exact answer to your question. Here is his info from the department page: [Kyle Brinkman](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/mse/people/faculty/brinkman.html). \n\n I did BS in MSE at Clemson, and just finished my masters of materials at NCSU, good luck with your MS!",

You may stay to stick with an advisor you liked in undergrad or so save money with BS to MS. Clemson has AMRL which is nothing to sneeze at.",

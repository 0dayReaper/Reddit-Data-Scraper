    "postText": "Hey Tigers! \n\nI'm Asa, a recent Clemson Grad and the person behind College Colors, a small collegiate apparel brand that's all about celebrating the unique aspects of various universities. I love designing pieces that help fans, students, alumni, and staff show their school pride in a meaningful way. \n\nI'm excited to share our latest Clemson University-inspired product with all of you! After listening to your feedback and carefully researching what makes Clemson truly special, we've crafted an exclusive crewneck sweatshirt (that we think is perfect) displaying Tillman Hall. My goal is to help Clemson enthusiasts wear their pride in a way that truly reflects their connection to this amazing university. \n\nAs a small business owner, I take customer satisfaction to heart and always strive to provide the best possible products. That's why I make sure to use top-notch materials and work closely with the institutions I partner with. \n\nIf you're curious to see the Clemson crewneck sweatshirt, you can find it on our website at [**https://collegecolorsllc.com/products/clemson-university-crewneck**](https://collegecolorsllc.com/products/clemson-university-crewneck). I hope you'll enjoy this sweatshirt as much as I enjoyed creating it! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat about Clemson and our products. You can contact me at [**collegecolorsllc@gmail.com**](mailto:collegecolorsllc@gmail.com). \n\nTake care and go Tigers! \n\nAsa",

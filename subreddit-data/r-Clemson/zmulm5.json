I don't really want to sign a lease anywhere since I most likely will have a job by spring 2024. Do you guys know of good places or websites to look for people who are wanting to sublease and are on the bus route?",

I'll be putting up an ad for the fall semester before next August, and will prefer to have an engineering roommate! Rent is $450 + half of utilities per month. You can PM me for details if you're curious!",

I had one last minute, but my roommate lined up got cold feet and signed a low quality lease before the deal was secured. Rn I just have an apartment that I\u2019m using to hang out in clemson til I start working in June and finish any job applications/interviews left. Subleasing in the spring is extremely difficult compared to the Fall. Definitely try to find a lease that\u2019s 6 months and good luck!\n\nI think the Groves my do 6 months. Non furnished, and you need to find roommates beforehand. But starting in January is plenty of time to figure it out.",

You must be 18 years or older, have normal color vision, have English fluency, and can sit at a computer for extended periods to participate. This is a Clemson University study, and the PI on this project is Nathan McNeese, who is an associate professor at Clemson University conducting the study with Beau Schelble. \n\nPlease contact Beau Schelble at [bschelb@g.clemson.edu](mailto:bschelb@g.clemson.edu) if you are interested in scheduling a time!

I know that I have to prove residency for 12 months amongst other things, but after 12 months would I have much of a chance of getting approved for in-state tuition for her sophomore or possibly junior year?\n\nThanks!",

So I had to have my parents not claim me so I could file as a sc resident. If you moved and are paying sc taxes it should work the same way.",

            "comment": "The big one for us when I was in a similar situation was proving you\u2019re employed in South Carolina. I had a neighbor who was working remotely for a company in Chicago and Clemson denied their residency/in-state based on that alone. They are very tough about that as I was told people abused it in South Carolina by using beach/vacation homes as their address, and the state cracked down 10-15 years ago or so.  \n  \nThere\u2019s essentially two options - you as the parent/guardian have to establish residency in SC for at least a year and pay SC taxes on income/property/etc and have the pay stubs (from an SC-based employer) to back it up. And you have to keep it current or else Clemson will try to have her moved to OOS as soon as they figure out you\u2019re not residents anymore.  \n  \nOr you can have her go completely independent and do it herself. You\u2019d have to leave her off your taxes/insurance/FAFSA and she\u2019d have to file herself. I knew a few people that did that, and they got it within a year. Also, last I checked, dorms don\u2019t count toward that year so you have to live off campus if you do that.  \n  \nClemson was militant about that when I was a student (2011-2016), but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s changed or if the school has gotten even tighter since then.",

Think about it: Walmart isn't based in SC, but if someone worked at a Walmart location in SC then they would pay SC income tax. They wouldn't pay income tax to Arkansas.\n\nWorking remotely/from home is different because it's harder to prove where you actually are at a given time.",

That's more likely the reason the other person was rejected. Because they could argue that you're not really living in SC and you just put a random SC address to try and cheat the system.\n\nIf you are going into a physical office in SC and living in a domicile in the state, and paying state income tax, then you have become a resident. You should probably put the address of the SC office on whatever paperwork you give to try to establish residency, because that's where you'll be working, even if it's not the headquarters or home office or whatever.\n\nThe LLC thing might help. But then they might want documentation to prove that you are serving customers in SC as opposed to creating a kind of shell corporation in SC while really living in Texas.",

I know a lot of people tried using their beach house address to get in state and that didn\u2019t work. Again HS was oos. Had a friend who finished her senior year in Ohio after her parents moved to the upstate during her junior year of HS. She tried getting in state tuition since her parents lived in state. Declined.

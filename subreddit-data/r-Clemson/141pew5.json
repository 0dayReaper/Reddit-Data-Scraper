    "postText": "My sweet outdoor kitty, Feral Ford, is still missing from The Cottages of Clemson. Last seen around unit 507-609 on May 14th, no chip or collar. Ford was supposed to go in for his vet appointment to be chipped, vaccinated, and neutered to join our family following graduation. The night before his appointment is when he went missing. PLEASE spread the word. If you or a friend picked him up thinking he was an unwanted stray, please contact me so that I know he is safe. I love this cat so much and have worked to tame him from a kitten to an adult. He is fluffy, around 8lbs, and has a VERY shrill meow. Reward is set at $200, which will increase next week. Contact me either via reddit or through snapchat (piperpyro) if found!",

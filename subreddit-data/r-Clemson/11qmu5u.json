Definitely go to career fairs and talk to companies, do internships when you can. The honors society (HKN) which hosts a mini career fair for just ECE majors. If you can get inducted, having HKN on your resume looks good and the people in it are really great. (At least they were when I graduated)\n\nI did a coop and it was a great opportunity that definitely helped when I decided to look for a different job (though I did get 2 offers from them from different offices). If you don\u2019t feel like taking extra time to graduate, internships each summer should be fine, but I hear they\u2019re really competitive.\n\nAlso, companies want to hire female engineers because there are so few of us. You may fail some classes and have to retake them, but as long as you don\u2019t fail all of them and have work experience, you should have no problem.\n\nGood luck! ECE can be very challenging at times, so finding someone who can give you advice about classes and professors is super useful :^)\n\nAlso also, AOE (engineering sorority) and SWE (society of women in engineering) are both great networking opportunities with other female engineers. I was in AOE and was interviewed by someone who graduated from UVA AOE, which I think helped me get the offer. I know SWE hosts career fairs and I think AOE may start based on a recent news letter I got.",

One side is for business type and the other is tech. They are looking for interns and new higher. There is also a small one in the spring and they have interviews over spring break. Reach out to the career center. They can help with r\u00e9sum\u00e9\u2019s and finding placement. Right now there is a shortage of engineers, especially EE in the area. Everyone is trying to hire like Fluor, Jacobs, O\u2019Neal, and Wood. Plus several other firms. Also make sure you have your Linken updated cause a lot of head hunters will reach out to you there.",

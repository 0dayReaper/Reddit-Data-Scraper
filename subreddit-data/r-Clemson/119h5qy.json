    "postText": "Hello Clemson gen chem students! I am offering free chemistry help for general chemistry students via YouTube. Every Wednesday at 7pm (EST) I have an interactive live stream on general chemistry topics. This week we are working on acid base problems including a neutralization/titration problem. You are welcome to join in and ask questions in the chat and request other chemistry topics/problems for future live streams.\n\nI was a college professor (mostly general chemistry, but a bit of organic as well) for ten years. The YouTube channel is Chem Help ASAP (link here: [https://www.youtube.com/c/ChemHelpASAP](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChemHelpASAP)) I hope I can help you understand chemistry a bit better!",

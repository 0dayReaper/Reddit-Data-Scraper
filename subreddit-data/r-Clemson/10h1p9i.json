    "postText": "I'm in my second semester of sophomore year in ECE and I really can't decide between CpE and EE. I really enjoyed circuits and logic (got an A in both), and while I didn't love CPSC 1110 I did like it.\n\nI will say that so far I have not enjoyed the labs. I really do prefer the theoretical aspect much better, but I've only had two labs so far so I don't want to base my choice completely off of this either.\n\nI guess what would help is knowing which have better job prospects and/or career options and versatility. How interchangeable are EE and CpE Jobs? Could a CpE apply for a regular EE job and vice versa?\n\nI apologize if this is a stupid question, but I am trying to decide if I should drop ECE 2220 before the drop deadline and just how different these two majors are from each other, since many of the classes overlap.",

That may help some",

If you\u2019re already struggling with 2220 I\u2019m just gonna let you know it only gets harder from there. \n\nThe only real difference between the ECE degrees is that CPE just trades some of the more advanced EE classes (electromagnetics, electronics 2, power, etc.) for programming classes. I\u2019m in 2230 now and it just kinda picks up where 2220 left off, increasing the difficulty a bit. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019d still at least be able to apply for a job requiring either one of the two degrees because usually job postings include some sort of \u201cor other applicable degree\u201d statement. And since they\u2019re so closely related, I doubt you\u2019d have any issues. EE majors might find it harder to get a more programming-oriented job though. \n\nIt\u2019s really just down to whether you\u2019d rather take programming classes or the EE classes.",

            "comment": "Labs here sucks. Nobody enjoys the labs, because they\u2019re poorly run and the TA\u2019s often know less about the content than the more capable students. So if you didn\u2019t enjoy a lab, don\u2019t read too deeply into that.\n\nAs far as jobs, they\u2019re very overlapping. You can get a software engineering job with an EE degree and a power engineering job with a CpE degree. Just do what you enjoy doing. If you loved circuits, maybe go with EE, if you loved logic, maybe go with CpE. But as someone else said, 2220 will be a pivotal class for you. If it just doesn\u2019t click for you, that\u2019s a solid indicator that you\u2019re gonna really struggle with the more advanced CpE classes, but if it really draws you in, you could fall in love with CpE later on.\n\nFinally, CPSC 1110 isn\u2019t taught great and is really just a very introductory level class to programming. ECE 2220 will tell you much more about your interests and counts towards both majors (as someone else said it\u2019s an EE tech elective).",

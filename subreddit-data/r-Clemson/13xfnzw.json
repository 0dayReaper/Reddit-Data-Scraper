            "comment": "GEOL 1120 and 1140 (that\u2019s the attached lab course) with Prof Emily Scribner. It\u2019s Earth Resources, so geology lite. If Geology is \u201crocks for jocks,\u201d this class is \u201crocks for jocks: easy mode.\u201d You get a front and back notes sheet on each exam and there\u2019s not really any homework for 1120 other than 3 group work assignments (there is a lab quiz activity due every Friday for 1140). Attendance is required and counts towards the grade (if you have an 85% participation rate at the end of the semester, this is in-class activities, that participation grade goes up to 100%).\n\nAlso, exams are graded in two parts (if you don\u2019t take it in the testing center). There\u2019s an individual exam and then you take it again as a group and they both go in the gradebook.\n\nAnd, this is the best part, if you miss an exam and don\u2019t take it before they go over it in class then you take an oral exam in her office. She basically asks you questions that are open ended and you can refer to your note sheet and take as long as you want. I was in there with her for 45 min to an hour for exam 3 and it was far easier than the written exam. Seriously, I said \u201cwhat\u2019s that thing they\u2019re planning on doing to transform Mars into a habitable place\u201d because I forgot the word \u201cterraform.\u201d I got a chuckle out of her! I got a 90 and that one exam brought my grade up from a 76 to an 85.",

That might be a key difference here.\n\nHow does CofC only have &lt; 20 cases while inside a city and having ceremonies for the past 3 weeks? \n\nMany universities that *are/have* done mandatory testing only did it upon arrival and 1 week later.\n\nClemson is doing legitimately everything it can to help track community spread. At this point, it's more obvious that other schools aren't following similar or the same processes.",

According to the agency\u2019s own antibody studies published Sept. 3 for samples collected up until late June, the actual figure for random testing of antibodies is only 11.4% for Stockholm, 6.3% for Gothenburg and 7.1% across Sweden.

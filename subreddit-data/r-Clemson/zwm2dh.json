    "postText": "My son and I are visiting Clemson on January 11th.  At all of the other schools, they have dorms available for tour, but Clemson offers no such thing.  Seeing if there is anyone who currently lives in the dorms and might be able to show us a couple different residence halls so we could see some different possibilities.  I realize that residence hall access is probably fairly limited, but maybe you have a friend in a different dorm so you could show us 2 or 3 different ones.  Will pay you for your time and can be pretty flexible as far as schedule that afternoon.  Our campus tour is at 1pm and we are staying the night in Clemson.  If interested, please reply or message me.  Thanks.",

The honors college staff doesn\u2019t have card/key access and they consider that \u201chousing\u201d not honors college. My son is a freshman at Clemson this year and none of the tours (including two sessions with Honors) never went in any of the dorms.",

It will likely be luck if the draw with who picks up the phone, but I\u2019ve learned if you ask enough people for a favor, at least one person will have the answers you\u2019re looking for. Best of luck.",

                            "comment": "I wonder if they changed this because I swear I saw a model \"dorm\" in the visitor center but that could have been USC.  It probably was.\n\nI'm very involved in Clemson's Residence Hall association so I've thought a lot about living spaces and such and I hope this list could highlight some things a lot of people leave out of consideration and potentially help even out of Clemson. \n\nHousing is only guaranteed for first year/freshman students. From what I remember it's some form of lottery or order based on when you committed/paid fees. \n\nThere is specific housing that is only for bridge students, from what I've seen of those spaces any single one of them is great, if he is in bridge he is required to live in one of those spaces, which the Clemson housing website will note. \n\nClemson home has its own YouTube channel so definitely tell him to check it out if he hasn't because there's walk throughs of a lot of the residence halls.\n\nThere are a few single rooms in some areas (I know gressette and maybe douthit east) but they are very pricey and hard to get. Depending on the type of student he is it might not be worth it.  \n\nApartments I'm pretty sure only Calhoun courts is open to first year students however it may not be anymore. (It is pretty dreary outside that area but there's a lot of space versus a traditional dorm). It's also two to a room still I believe. \n\nAs far as bathrooms go, he's probably going to have to share. There are multiple types including hall (think more traditional locker room sort of stalls), wet core (shared bathrooms with multiple on floor. Each is a completely floor to ceiling door with individual toilet/shower combo (my favorite as I get that privacy while going, but don't have to clean the most I have to worry about is drunk students on the weekend), and suite (you share with three ish other people (but you have to clean it yourself as well as I believe soap).\n\nI mentioned type of student. I say that because what he should be looking for varies depending on what he values most. Affordability, if he's willing to give up a little comfort and go for one of the older, one of the high rises or shoeboxes would be the best bet. If he's super interested in football and wants to be very involved in sports watching and those sorts of things some of the dorms in core campus are closer to those areas (although douthit also has a really great gym too). \n\nLLCs are also a thing to consider. If he's a specific major (business, communications, engineering ect) or holds a certain identity (connections, lavender place ect)  there are many opportunities for living learning communities at Clemson. If he's looking to really get involved in resources at Clemson and his major, that community aspect may be more important than what specific dorm he goes to. I'm a queer student at Clemson so I joined the LGBTQ+ living learning community it gave me a lot of support and safety, going into college would have been scary not knowing if my own room was safe so that took a weight off my shoulders. But an LLC is not an end all be all. They provide great resources and connections which some students need/want (but Clemson and plenty of other schools offer lots of mentoring programs not connected to residence halls). \n\nI tend to see that a lot of people interested in fraternities and sororities end up living in Gressette and Douthit (however there's not required space and plenty are elsewhere it's just something I notice and I'm not involved in it so it may not hold true) that might be something to consider if he's interested in Greek life (Clemson has so many options within and outside of Greek life!) \n\n\nThe housing website has a lot of different tabs and things to look around under. And resources so that's another great space to find information. There should be a list of different emails you can contact for more information directly from the college but I hope this helps any. \n\nGood luck on his decision!",

I am surprised that more schools don't use dorms as a selling point.  Auburn had available tours of every one of their different styles.  Alabama showed a few as well.  It definitely makes an impression.",

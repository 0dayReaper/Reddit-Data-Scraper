    "postText": "Hey all, I wanted to make everyone aware of a new Creative Inquiry opportunity under Dr. Laura Redmond next year, as we are looking to recruit undergraduate students.\n\nThe creative inquiry will take on [NASA\u2019s Micro-g NExT](https://microgravityuniversity.jsc.nasa.gov/about-micro-g-next) challenge in which undergraduate students design, build, and test a tool or device that addresses an authentic, current space exploration challenge. This overall experience includes hands-on engineering design, test operations, and public outreach. Design proposals are due at the end of October, and if approved, there is the potential to travel to the Johnson Space Center to test the tool in a simulated environment. \n\nWe are recruiting at least 6 fully dedicated undergraduate students for the Fall 2023 and Spring 2024 academic year, who can dedicate around 5 hours per week to the project, and who can also do preliminary work during the Spring 2023 and potentially Summer 2023 (online) semesters to prepare. We are mainly looking for engineering majors but are open to others joining as well. The skills that we are looking for include: \n\n\\- Testing/prototyping \n\n\\- Structural analysis \n\n\\- Videography/3D Modeling/Visual media and design\n\n\\- Proficiency in CAD (SolidWorks or AutoCAD)\n\n\\- ME shop access and tool experience\n\n\\- 3D Printing\n\nIf you are interested, please fill out the Google Survey application below by **October 14th, 2022**: \n\n[https://forms.gle/BLRHQPH8uuRxHDiH8](https://forms.gle/BLRHQPH8uuRxHDiH8)\n\nFor questions, please reach out to [adensie@clemson.edu](mailto:adensie@clemson.edu)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ynvjsa3qm9q91.jpg?width=1700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=793e7bad9202146f0f755a4eeea017154be5b9ef",

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI've been accepted into a doctoral program for Fall 23'. The financial package offered include a stipend of $28,000 and the program will cover the entire tuition but I'll be responsible for paying academic fees(also includes insurance), which will be arround $4,000.\n\nThis leaves me 24 K for entire year.\nIs this amount enough to live comfortably in the Clemson area? It seems rents have gone up by a lot in the past few years and a nice room at a 2B/3B apartment near campus would cost almost a $1000 per month. What has your experience been like?\n\nThanks",

It\u2019s nice to live near campus, but there\u2019s a lot of transportation options. For example, The Collective is pretty nice. I pay around 830 after utilities. They have a private shuttle during the week to campus. Also Clemson has the Red Route that picks up from some of the communities.\n\n\nI\u2019d also just verify that you have a full tuition and fees coverage vs a tuition waiver. I have a tuition waiver, so I still have to pay fees. That costs me around 800 per semester. I do know people in other departments who have full coverage tho. \n\nDM me if you have any particular questions!",

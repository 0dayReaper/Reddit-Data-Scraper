    "postText": "I got into Clemson as an Animal and Veterinary Science major and would like to get feedback from students or alumni of the program about how well it prepared them for their future careers and just how much they liked it overall. I plan to go to vet school and eventually specialize in equine surgery, so I would also like to know what you all think of the equine opportunities/programs on campus and how you all feel Clemson affected your applications to vet school if you applied. Also, I am interested in research and volunteer opportunities, so is there access to those opportunities as well? I'm just trying to get as much information as possible before I make my decision on where to do my undergrad, so any information is appreciated, thank you!",

            "comment": "Animal Science major alum here, I thought that Clemson\u2019s program did a very very good job in preparing me for various careers and such. While I wanted to go to Vet School, I found a different passion in education, but the skills and knowledge learned in the program have helped in that field. Many of the professors I had have now retired but there are good professors still there! Also - the program is broken into three different areas (or at least it used to), which were agribusiness, prevet, and equibusiness. So if that\u2019s still an option, consider that with what you want to do with veterinary/equine.",

The new college has begun a search for a founding dean and identified possible space for a new facility and would serve a growing need for the state of South Carolina. The current plan anticipates the creation of the school for the 2026-2027 academic year.",

They have a solid equine breeding program there that would be one way to get some large animal experience, as well as Performance Equine which is relatively close by (Aiken) for some private practice shadowing experience. Also plenty of research opportunities, particularly in food animal! Cannot say enough positive things about their program and how it prepared me for where I am today :)",

Unfortunately there\u2019s only a very few amount of vet clinics in the area to help you get some exposure to large animal. Do you have a preference vet school in mind? If so, definitely research look for how the schools look at apps, what kind of volunteer work they look for, etc. Vet schools are very competitive and difficult to get accepted to but there is such a shortage for all vet staff at the moment.",

I know that vet schools really value clinical volunteer experience, so if there aren't a lot of opportunities for that around Clemson, that's a huge downside.",

In this area all of the large animal vets stopped as there is zero money in large animal and it\u2019s expensive to do unless you\u2019re somewhere like Tryon, Aiken, etc. That being said, there are some places where you can work to get more exposure but it\u2019s not around here. Clemson has a great equine management/business program but not a teaching hospital which is the main bummer.",

Dr Stafford (equine only) used to have interns with him often when I used him. There are a few other equine vets that I\u2019m sure you could ride along with if you establish a relationship with them. Get involved at a local boarding barn, volunteer to hold horses for the vet on farm calls.\n\nThere is a Facebook page specifically for \u201cclemson area equine networking\u201d - very active, may give you a better feel for the scene. I know my farm very often has at least one Clemson or Tri Country student on staff and many more barns will also hire Clemson students.\n\nMy roommate was a prevet major and worked at one of Clemson\u2019s farms - not just volunteering! I also have known several Clemson students that have done internships at Hagyard up in Kentucky. Definitely opportunities if you\u2019re involved and actively look for them - which ou should be doing to get into vet school regardless!",

OF course we are dressed up in something totally nerdy every week, but this time with a theme!\n\nIt's the second month of the fall tournament, but don't let that stop you from coming out, prizes are for the single night winners as well.\n\nWe really hope to see you there, it's our favorite night of the month (third Wednesday of every month!), and we love seeing everyone enjoying themselves and showing off what they know.\n\nTeam signups 6:00-6:30, game starts at 6:30.  And it's free to play!",

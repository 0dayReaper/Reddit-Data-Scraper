            "comment": "Hey!  I have heard of several so far.  All have been in homes, not apartments.  They are beginning to be noticed now because the pipes are thawing and the water is beginning to flow through them (and, unfortunately, out of them if they burst).\n\nDoes your place have a maintenance crew that you can contact?  If so and you feel comfortable with it, ask if they'll do a quick check.  \n\nI wonder if many of the complexes will start doing checks tomorrow since so many tenants are students and have gone home for the break.\n\nAlso, this is a good time to remind people to get renter's insurance to protect your belongings.  It is dirt cheap.  When University Ridge burned, I worked next door for CU.  We were told that only two people (not two units, just two people) had renter's insurance.  The other tenants were SOL.",

Other times, you might have to listen for running water.  For example, I can hear water running through the pipes in *parts* of my house.  Unfortunately, last summer, I had a leak in a half-bath that I never use and keep the door shut all the time.  The water bill came and it was over $1000 for the month.  I never heard the leak.  It was bad.\n\nYou can also go out to your water meter when water isn't being used in your house (no one is showering, no toilet flushing, no dishwasher, etc.).  If the meter is moving, there is likely a leak.",

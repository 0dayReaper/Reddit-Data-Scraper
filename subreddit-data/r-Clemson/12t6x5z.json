    "postText": "Hi All,\n\nI'm an incoming first-year graduate student from out of state, and I really need to get housing figured out. I'm generally looking for somewhere clean, safe, relatively cheap and fairly quiet. I wanted to know everyone's thoughts on a few places I'm considering:\n\n\\- **Heritage at Riverwood/Heritage Hills** \\- heard great things about the Burtons, just curious about whether it's really worth the price this year, as I've heard they raised rent quite a bit recently.\n\n\\- **The Reserve** \\- I've heard all good things on Reddit, but the Google reviews are pretty abysmal, mostly complaints about roach infestations (as a northern transplant that sounds concerning, but I've heard a lot of people say roaches are just the norm in the south?). I'm also wondering if this is more of a place for partying undergrads, or if it's reasonably quiet.\n\n\\- **The Groves** \\- my fallback option. I've heard a lot of negatives about this place, most of it focused on the thin walls, parking/guests, WiFi (I've heard you can buy your own), mail and keeping your deposit; yet the graduate students I've spoken with who lived there said it was fine and they didn't have any issues. Any thoughts on this not already posted on other posts would be helpful/informative.\n\n\\- **100 Regency** \\- I haven't been able to find much at all on what it's like to live here.\n\n\\-Anything on **Orange Property Management, Bolt Property Management** or **Carolina Foothills Property Management**.\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "There is an old school in Central on the bus line that was turned into student apartments, it is pretty quiet but I haven't been inside in a lot of years so I don't know about bugs, and according to my friend who lived there at the time it was really reasonable in price. The name of the place is Church Street Apartments. Anything in Central is generally cheaper and quieter than Clemson because of distance from CU and the Southern Wesleyan students. My best friend lives right behind SWU and you would never know there is a college in the neighborhood.\n\nYou might also check with Foothills Property Management. They rent out a lot of houses to students to share and a lot of their tenants are PhD students. One of my clients rents her upstairs to only PhD students through them. Hope this helps.",

Good mix of college kids, families, grad students, etc. Great management and much more affordable than most places (and better quality imo).",

The management is so good with me (whenever I need any maintenance they send immediately), (called : top of the hill management). They were flexible with me. Houses are old a little but compared to other prices, still good for me. Walk like 5 minutes to nearest bust station and like 10 or less to vorizone. The house is 2 rooms one bathroom so perfect for couples or single individuals.",

I just let them know last week, so if you called them earlier they might have said they were full. It\u2019s a 2 bed/2 bath, $1075/mo (cats are additional $75/mo/cat, no dogs allowed). It\u2019s a top corner unit, so nice and quiet and great for grad students, especially if you split with a friend. If interested, you can call or visit their leasing office and ask about unit 104P.",

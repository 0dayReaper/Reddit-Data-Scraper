Then this Mega Thread is for you!\n\n**IMPORTANT DATES FOR APPLICATIONS**\n\n* **August 1st - Application Opens**\n* **October 15th - Deadline for Early Action**\n* **December 1st - Early Action Decisions Go Out**\n* **January 2nd - Regular Decision Date (FILE MUST BE COMPLETE!)**\n* **March 1st - Regular Decisions Go Out**\n* **May 1st - Last Day to Apply**\n\n**What's the difference between Early Action and Regular Decision?**\n\nEarly Action means you get your application in early including things like your recommendation letters, test scores, self reported academics aka grades, essays etc.. and then in turn Clemson gets back to you early to give you an answer. They could admit you, deny you, or say they are gonna wait til regular decision to see all of the applicants. If Clemson is a top choice I'd recommend getting your application in for EA, but on the flip side don't sweat it if you apply for regular decision.\n\n**How can I apply?**\n\nThere are two main ways most students apply to Clemson. You can go directly to the Clemson admissions website and fill out the paper work OR you can use the Common App which is a website setup so kids can easily apply to multiple colleges across the US. The Common App has quickly become the major way most students apply to college. Keep in mind though that no matter how you apply it won't effect your admission chances.\n\n**Is there an application fee?**\n\nYes there is a $70 fee (for 22/23). If you have financial hardships though you can fill out a waver to see if you can apply for free.\n\n**What if I want to apply to the Clemson Honors College?**\n\nClemson gives priority status to those who want to do the Honors College so you need to get your application in by that Early Action deadline. When you fill out your initial application you'll see a box you can check indicating you want to apply to the Honors College. If you check yes once you've submitted your regular Clemson application you'll get access to your Clemson admissions portal. In that portal will be a SEPARATE application you have to fill out for the honors college due by Nov 1st. They will try and let you know if you got into the Honors College by Feb 1st.\n\nIf you miss the the EA deadline you can still apply for the Honors College for regular decision, just know you won't get priority. You'll need your honor's app in by Feb 1st with a March 15th decision  date.\n\n**Does when I apply to Clemson matter?**\n\nWhy yes it does! Many interested students don't know this portion, but your housing selection if you get in and choose to go is given out by application date. This also means if you already have a roommate picked out ahead of time whomever sent their application in 1st will get to pick for the group.\n\n**What do I need to get into Clemson?**\n\nClemson has posted the 2021 admissions stats. They go as follows.\n\n* SAT - 1240 -1400 (middle 50%)\n* ACT - 29-30 (middle 50%)\n* Applied - 47,007\n* Accepted - 23,138\n* Enrolled - 4,593\n\nI know these numbers all went up as someone who has a child who got accepted and saw some of the 2022 admissions stats. The largest number of kids ever applied and enrolled, and the test scores and GPA keep going up.\n\nIn general if you're around 1300 SAT/30 ACT with a weighted GPA as close to 4.0 as possible you're probably good to go. Keep in mind too that Clemson takes a holistic view of your application and they look at your course work, if you took harder classes like honors/AP/IB, extra circulars, essays, jobs, family life etc...\n\n**I heard Clemson is optional for things like Test Scores, Essays, and Recommendations?**\n\nThis question gets asked a lot. In the **MACRO** yes you only need your GPA and to hit the minimum requirements on the application in terms of things like essays or recommendations.\n\nIn practice in the **MICRO** if they are picking between two students and one kid sent in solid test scores, got extra letters of recommendation, sent in a resume or personal statement, and wrote extra essays who do you think is gonna win the tiebreaker especially if you are borderline?\n\n**What major should I chose and does this matter on my application?**\n\nIn short YES!\n\nIn long form there are a couple of things to consider. Clemson allows you to pick a major and a backup major on your application. Clemson also has a few hard capped majors. Things like Nursing, Sports Management, and Architecture only have so many slots, and they only let so many kids in those majors once a year. It's also worth noting you might not get in for say Communications, but you might get in for another major. Keep in mind you can't switch to Communications without talking to the department as they still only take X amount of kids so you'd be competing with the next batch of kids applying.\n\nAlso the hack back in the day was to put something like Farm Ag  as a second major as they always had slots to get you in. Performing Arts is a no go as a backup because Clemson requires those people to jump through extra hoops like a portfolio and an audition.\n\nIt's also worth noting Clemson funnels kids into majors like Pre Business or General Engineering for year 1. Then you pick your specialty after you get through some intro classes. This way kids get a better grasp on if they want to be say a Chemical Engineer or an Electrical Engineer.\n\n**What are LLCs?**\n\nThese are living learning communities on campus. You can join something such as RISE which is Residents in Science and Engineering.  You all tend to live in the same buildings, get extra access to classes and tutoring, and opportunities to do things pick your dorm and move in early. Clemson is expanding the number of LLCs offered too so you can find one that might fit you!\n\n**What is Clemson Summer Start?**\n\nA small select group of kids will get admitted for the Summer Start program. The general reasoning is to filter kids in to take 2 classes over the Summer before Fall starts to help kids get a couple of general education classes in while (in theory) making it easier for everyone in the fall to register and not have classes overloaded. If you get picked for Summer Start that's what you have to do.\n\nI know many kids get picked for this and it can seem like a bummer to have your final Summer after graduation from HS changed because you have to do Summer Start. In practice once most of the kids get on campus they have the time of their life they never expected. One of my kids got in for Summer Start, and he wasn't excited. I told him better than being denied or bridged. He ended up going, and it was the best experience in the world for him. He was soooo much more confident in the fall, created tons of friendships, banked 6 credit hours, and in general learned so much about college and Clemson is a much less stressful environment. \n\n**What is Bridge to Clemson?**\n\nOk so you applied, and you check your decision only to see you got hmmm Bridged? This basically means you can live on campus in special housing designated for Clemson Bridge students with access to Clemson facilities while you take classes at Tri County Tech. Then if you pass you automatically a regular student for sophomore year.\n\nIs it worth it? Honestly yes and no. If you are a borderline student who didn't get into Clemson proper and this is your dream school, then honestly just go. Nobody is gonna walk around and be like were you a bridge student or anything. On the flip side if you didn't get in but you got into some other big schools or you have a ton of AP credits already then you're probably better off going elsewhere. If you've got 6 or 7 AP credits already which gives you idk say 20hrs already you're probably better off going to USC if you get in or some other major school you applied to.\n\n\\*Anecdotal, but it appears more instate kids than out of state kids get bridged. There have been various theories throughout the years on who gets put in summer start and bridged.\n\n**Other Tips**\n\nSchedule a visit to come see Campus. Also reach out to the department you are applying to. They might have a separate tour where you can see that department, meet some faculty and staff, and get to know some current students in the major.\n\nTALK TO YOUR ADMISSIONS COUNSELOR! I can't stress this enough no matter where you apply. Talk to them. Let them know you are interested. Have them help you with whatever you can. Same goes for your department. While they don't get final say or anything a good word from a professor or department chair to the admissions office can only help your chances!\n\nPS: I'll edit this topic as I go in case there is something else I forgot or something else someone recommends!\n\nPSS: Here is Clemson Class of 2026 Info Graphic\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfne6s89d2l91.jpg?width=8000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c985c1193e7ee215a33787438fd87942912d6422",

However, the rest of my application is what makes me stand out. Planning to double major in Sports Media and Sports Management \n\n- Played varsity ice hockey in one of the hardest conferences on the east coast, 4 year letterman, 3 year starter, 2 year captain. Played club for a respected organization, starter each year and state champion last year. \n- Graduating from a college-prep private Catholic high school that is highly regarded for its academics  and regularly sends students to Clemson\n- AP Scholar, Delegate at American Legion Jersey Boys State, Italian Honors Society, and apart of John\u2019s Hopkins CTY. One of the first members of school\u2019s business club and first ever president\n\nWhere my app really stands out is my experience. \n- On the business side, I was with a Frontier League baseball team as a sales and marketing intern for their whole season this year. \n- Media side, I am employed as the only journalist for a company that covers high school sports in NJ. They have accumulated around 40k followers across social media in their year and a half of doing this. \n- I work for a start-up professional sports media company called The Wrightway Sports Network. I write articles for their website, am one of the leads of NHL content, am a main proponent of the YouTube channel, and more. The company regular has 10k+ visitors to its site each day, is partnered with USA Today, and is starting to set a headquarters down and work on sponsorship deals in Cincinnati \n- I also work for a local company that covers high school sports in the three counties around me. I\u2019ve done play-by-play and color commentary for football, hockey, and baseball. I hosted a weekly highlight show every week last year in a professional studio setting. I am a correspondent on the weekly high school football kick off show that is also in a professional studio environment. I write articles for the website, and helped run and teach the internship program this summer. The company has become pretty big, 4 million engagements each week\n\nWhat will the HC be looking for in my application outside of what I have now to be able to be seriously considered? Can I submit a portfolio or resume with my HC application?",

A few years ago (before test optional) there was a minimum score that the honors college had in order to apply.  As long as you were above that minimum, having a higher score did not give you an advantage.  It was all about the essay.  Spend time on the honors college website to understand their values and what they might be looking for in candidates.   You may want to call the honors college and ask them if your scores are above the minimum they are looking for.  My experience has been they are very helpful if you have questions.  Also, if you don\u2019t get in initially you can always appeal afterwards this spring.  You can also reapply during freshman year.",

Clemson has turned out to be a wonderful school though, and I haven't met anyone who was ever involved in my application decision. There really are so many resources, clubs, and opportunities here--like being able to free 3D print every day, practice job interviews, speak to advisors in any school type, I have so many academic mentors and study sessions to go to, etc. There's so much to do on-campus that you can't even do anything. New lecturers, movies to go to every week. Leadership training. CPR classes.\n\nSome cons I'd tell you though: This college is more expensive than I anticipated. The hard courses like chemistry are incredibly difficult. You really have to stay caught up and **strong** with the material or you can get lost quickly. Many of the tests and exams here are on timers. If I'd known this earlier I would've gotten my ADHD assessed sooner for test-taking accommodations.

I had one honors course I did well in, and it showed I was taking two first senior semester and one last senior semester. I had no APs and had schooling online; my school offered none. I could have done dual enrollment, though. Applied for CS first, Engineering second. I got a Bridge to Clemson offer pursuing a B.S. in C.S. I was also accepted by UofSC, CoC, CSU, CCU, and Winthrop. Wofford waitlisted me. I will accept the Bridge offer and would attempt an appeal if I had convincing things to say; I will think about this more.",

I have a 3.95 gpa unweighted and a 4.793 gpa weighted (i think those are right if not switch the weighted and un weighted, the numbers are right tho), Ive taken honors pretty much my whole life, Im taking two IB classes rn and next year (Im a junior) I'll be enrolled in three next year, I wont be taking a third foreign language next year (so far as I know, but that could change). Im also like 13th (top 15 for sure) in a class of 75 (small ik). My extra curriculars include; cheer and colorguard, next year ill be doing yearbook. I plan on doing fundraisers between now and over the summer, I help with my schools Cheer camp for young girls, and I help with Vacation Bible School at my church as well. Im apart of a National Honor Society and this summer I will be attending Palmetto Girls State, so thats somthing I'll fore sure be adding to my application. The problem is, I have a 1010 SAT and a 19 ACT, Im studing to re take the SAT and bring up my score but its literally been awful so far for me. This post was kinda all over the place but thats the gist of my future application. I really need some help if you guys dont mind giving me any ideas or ballpark pitches, thank you so much.",

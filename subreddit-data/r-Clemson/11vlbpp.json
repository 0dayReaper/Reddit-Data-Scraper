It has a dinning hall right below it and is mostly central to classes so I liked it and I liked having a more private bathroom but it\u2019s kinda personal preference.",

            "comment": "Have one friend who lived there freshman year and another who was an ra there. Decent rooms, nothing special but they\u2019re alright. You do have a common hall bathroom, it is not suite style. Can be loud but that\u2019s pretty constant across every building. Really close to the stadium if she\u2019s into football. You do have to go outside to get into core (the dining hall) but it\u2019s still close. One thing is that the spectrum program or whatever it\u2019s called is housed there. Nothing against autistic people but my ra friend did say that he had to constantly confront them about creeping on girls, so your daughter would need to watch out for that. Again there\u2019s creeps everywhere but that was one thing he had to deal with pretty often. I\u2019m not aware of the prices but mickel is a lot nicer and you don\u2019t have to share a bathroom with your whole hall, just your suite mates. Also Mickel has really nice study rooms which are in the perfect position to watch the game from if you don\u2019t want to go in.",

Definitely do not pick a room next to an RA. Other than that they are pretty much the same. My room is right beside a bathroom at the end of a hallway, so it is a tad bit big which has been nice. Having a room beside a bathroom was no where near as annoying as I was expecting it to be. It\u2019s actually been pretty nice! You cannot see into the stadium as the new scoreboard is in the way so if that is a priority for you I would say live in Mickel. Floor wise I would try and pick one with a water bottle fill station like 3 or 5.",

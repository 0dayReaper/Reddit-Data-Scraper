No recruiter cares that you did both. It would likely be detrimental, since you would need to stay longer or take 19 hours+ a semester and have no time to get experience through internships and or co-op.",

For two, you would have a really difficult time scheduling classes since engineering lab blocks and studio blocks are often at the same time. Personally, I got an engineering degree and minored in architecture. Then I went on to get a masters in Architecture, which was only one year longer than if I had majored in it. Clemson has an architecture minor where you study abroad in Italy over the summer, which is absolutely fantastic if that\u2019s an option for you! That said, if you are on the fence about degrees, short term it is a lot easier to switch into Engineering than Architecture (I tried that at one point). Long term, if you are at all interested in professional licensure in engineering, then majoring in it is the way to go.",

            "comment": "Senior Architecture student here at Clemson about to graduate. \n\nShort answer is no. \n\nI do know one example of this working but not with undergraduate programs and DEFINITELY not at the same time. One of the faculty in the Architecture school here at Clemson Amy Trick, I believe was a licensed civil engineer and transitioned to also holding a license in architecture. Might want to reach out to her if that\u2019s a career path you\u2019re considering.\n\nLikely what would happen is you get your undergraduate in Engineering and then go to graduate school for Architecture. Not 100% sure on licensing requirements for engineers but architects need an accredited professional degree (ie Clemsons M.Arch) to practice and be licensed. You would probably be looking at the 3 year program instead of the 2 year program in M.Arch so that\u2019s 7 years of school\u2026BUT if you minored in architecture with your undergrad in engineering you MIGHT have a better shot of making the 2 year M.Arch program and needing only 6 years of school. \n\nLong story short. Architecture is the single most demanding area of study you can possibly take. There is something like a 50% drop out rate the 1st year and probably something like 10-20% the second year. It\u2019s not for everyone. I\u2019m never one for saying something CANT be done because you certainly probably COULD pull off what you\u2019re talking about. But your architecture work will look like shit and your engineering bridges are gonna all fall down. You\u2019ll just be a stressed wreck.",

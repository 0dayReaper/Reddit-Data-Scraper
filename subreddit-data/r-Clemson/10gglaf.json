They also know many, many students are always looking to switch roommates or complexes from the ones that they signed over a year ago. You are not likely to find any easy outs on you lease. They do this shit for a living.\n\nYou need to find someone to sublease it, but you may have to subsidize some of the rent each month. Maybe offer $700 to the sublessor so it knocks $100 off per month left.",

We haven\u2019t had to deal with it yet but it is inevitable. \n\nI personally think it is unfair but I am OPEN to listening to others points of view. \n\nThis is a civil discussion, please don\u2019t get personal. Let\u2019s talk about it.",

            "comment": "Hey! I actually wrote an entire research paper on this exact topic! TLDR yes according to studies on the highest level men have like an average 13% advantage and it varies depending on the type of sport. (Writing this off memory) muscle mass is different, bone structures are different for running, and even stuff like testosterone levels have a play into athletic performance. Some of the best women athletes actually have testosterone levels akin to a male. There are also a significantly lower amount of women participating in many competitive activities due to the nature of the females being overall less competitive in all regards making the pool of available talent for high level sports being even lower and even trickles into other things like eSports, chess, etc. \n\nIf anyone is interested in the full paper I would love to share it and discuss!",

            "comment": "I think thats a bad framing of the question. Men *obviously* have an advantage in pretty much all sports (professional women tend to be slightly worse than high school varsity boys in a wide number of events). A better framing of this question is whether or not the effects of estrogen and lowered testosterone negate the advantage conferred by male puberty. As the sample size is pretty small, its hard to know if any of the research is good, but in general it seems like the advantage still remains in sports like weightlifting, but dissipates somewhat more in sports like swimming.",

The time to qualify to tryout for the US men\u2019s swim team is 1:02.19. \n\nSports that require head to head physicality are dominated by males.  Only sports that negate physical differences can be gender neutral. Sports like shooting, sailing, auto racing, and equestrian only really need skill. You don\u2019t have to be the strongest or fastest.",

The question ends up being at what point the lines are blurred to the point that the male/female divisions should just be merged or a separate trans catagory created because there is no \u201cfair\u201d way to address every situation. I think going by purely biological sex is the most rational separation, but momentum is headed the other way.",

That's not saying they can't compete, but they need a different / regulated division to avoid injury to women athletes. Protecting the rights of women is not crapping on the rights of others, and to say so imo would mean you are fine with bio women's rights being trampled on.\n\nBiological women are a protected class too.",

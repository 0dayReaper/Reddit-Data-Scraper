Even last season it was packed at the wake forest game. The problem is limiting capacity, it ought to not be fenced off and be allowed to be filled with as many people as want to be there.",

Maybe you are thinking of 2021. There have been many times in recent history that the hill has been noticeably under filled, even during bigger games. And when it was $10 general admission it wasn\u2019t always packed either. Many times my friends and I had enough room to throw a football back and forth during games back in the day.",

The students that realize it's not for them get different seats.\n\nIt's not like the hill isn't packed every big game.",

When fans go onto the field, it might be more dangerous if someone gets pushed off of one of these steps rather than down a slope. Maybe I'm wrong, though.",

For lecture attendance was graded and participation was encouraged (I don\u2019t think it was required though). For the lab portion, I believe we had 4 speeches total (2 individual, 1 group, 1 video). Most of your grade is based off of stuff you do in the lab portion (speeches, outlines, and reflections mainly) and the tests were online and open note. Overall I\u2019d recommend her!",

I think 1500 works if you don't plan on majoring in communication studies. I might be misremembering tho so its probably best to ask someone from the comm department currently.",

            "comment": "2500 is basically 1500, without the lab.\n\nIn 1500, you\u2019ll go to the lecture and take some notes/quizzes/exams. Then, a couple times a week you\u2019ll go to a lab where youll prepare and deliver your speeches.\n\nIn 2500, everything is combined. You\u2019ll go to class like normal, but a few of the days will be dedicated to preparing or delivering speeches in class, rather than in a separate lab.\n\nI personally took 2500 (not a comm major) with a grad TA. It was very easy as long as you put any shred of effort into it. I found it pretty great for my schedule too. It clears up a few hours a week, since you won\u2019t have that extra lab component.",

I got to do my informative speech on the unusual uses of Dawn Dish Soap. Only one person in there was a COMM Major. Because there\u2019s about 15 people in the class, the professor actually gets to know you if you\u2019re open to it! He\u2019s literally the reason I\u2019m getting a Creative Inquiry. I know he also stayed behind to talk with one of the guys about blacksmithing after the icebreaker and never stopped. I had to talk to him a few times and listening to them was kind of interesting. \n\nThese are some of the great moments from this class:\n\n- Leland getting on the table to demonstrate proper posture when speaking, mainly that you shouldn\u2019t lock your knees. It looked like he was about to start twerking but it was just a pose. I heard he did this in 1500 too\n- Guessing previous speech topics. The blood letting speech did actually happen btw\n- A military exercise where you get dropped in Northern Canada after a plane crash. You can take 5 of the 15 objects, which do you pick? (Hint: do not choose the air map, it provides hope, which isn\u2019t helpful. My group\u2019s plan C was to drink ourselves to death with the tequila if all else failed)\n- Discussing the credibility of Hitler. This was an interesting debate and we ended up disagreeing with him.\n- a guy from the medieval times gets transported to modern day, you have to get him to do four things. How do you explain what the heck is going on to a guy that doesn\u2019t know what a car or phone is? Car: boat on wheels (it\u2019s got a steering wheel so it\u2019s not like a carriage)",

I am doing a research project and have a few questions about what it\u2019s like eating at Clemson\u2019s dining halls with a dietary restriction (allergy, vegan, lactose, etc). What are some of the things you\u2019ve experienced dining on campus, and what have been your biggest challenges?",

I don't go to core often because most of what they serve is not dye free. Shilletter is a bit easier but still have issues there occasionally. My biggest problem is normally with cheese, because they use dyed cheese in a lot here. The instantance that stands out most to me is when doutchit hub changed their ingredients quesadillas from one I could eat it one I couldn't. I almost emailed to ask to announce ingredient changes, but I have a feeling even if I did I'd be ignored.",

I used to live on Old Central and depending on the weather/wind it can definitely stink sometimes.\n\nThe pipes got clogged a few years back and overflowed onto the sidewalk/street near my house and it REEKED. All because Wendy's/other fast food joints were secretly dumping their grease into the drains too. It was a mess :(",

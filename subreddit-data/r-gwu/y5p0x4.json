    "postText": "Hey! \n\nI'm a senior in high school from New York City and I'm deciding on my ED this week. My top 2 schools are GW and UVM and I'm having a tough time deciding between the two. I just had a few questions I was wondering if you guys could answer.\n\n1- Is it true that students are more like DC residents than college students? I've heard this from a couple people and I was just wondering the truth about it. If this is the case, is it harder to meet new people/make new friends?\n\n2- How intense is the political climate? I get it, the school is in DC but is the political climate something you have to seek out or is everyone super into politics? I want to be a Psych major so yeah.\n\n3- Whats night life like? Are there lots of parties or do students mainly go to clubs/bars?\n\n4- Genuinely how tough is the school? \n\n5- Whats the student body like? Are they preppy or smth like that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm having a very tough time deciding between these two schools so any info would be greatly appreciated! Thank you so much!!",

            "comment": "&gt;1- **Is it true that students are more like DC residents than college students**? I've heard this from a couple people and I was just wondering the truth about it. If this is the case, is it harder to meet new people/make new friends?\n\nI've never heard it put that way but honestly that's very true of a huge chunk of GW students. I would count myself in that category and personally would say that you're really missing out on a big part of the experience if you limit yourself to the Foggy Bubble. I'm a very extroverted person so I don't have trouble making friends in a \"nontraditional\" way relative to the average american college experience (there's no quad to chill on, people mostly don't go to basketball games, etc), but it's definitely a struggle for some people\n\nGW needs to do a better job advertising the fact that you're basically starting your real life once you get to campus, and that there's *very little* hand-holding after orientation\n\n&gt;2- How intense is the political climate? I get it, the school is in DC but is the political climate something you have to seek out or is everyone super into politics? I want to be a Psych major so yeah.\n\nI was very involved in political orgs as a freshman (and like tons of people at GW, I interned in the house and senate\\*). Interning on the hill made me realize how uninterested I was in politics and since then I've largely ignored politics. It's really not hard to avoid politics on campus, most people who are serious about politics are too busy working on the hill (or rigging elections for the Dems Eboard) to do much on campus\n\n&gt; Whats night life like? Are there lots of parties or do students mainly go to clubs/bars?\n\nNo idea how the freshman party scene is with the new thurston renovations, but plenty of people still party in dorms or off campus houses. Greek life isn't huge, but it's there if you want it. My social scene mostly revolves around the clubs that I'm in (club sports are a staple of GW's party scene), but I also spend a lot of time going to various off-campus bars. There's so much to explore in DC that (again) I try to avoid getting stuck in foggy\n\n&gt;4- Genuinely how tough is the school?\n\nGW is an incredibly easy school. Things obviously depend on your major and specific classes from semester to semester, but for the most part, classes are designed so you can take a full courseload, party, and intern all at the same time. I worked 20-40 hours/week last spring at an off campus job and still got all A's (IA/Finance double major)\n\n&gt; 5- Whats the student body like? Are they preppy or smth like that?\n\nGW attracts a very diverse crowd (though the average student is disproportionately wealthy), so you'll find all kinds of people here. The answers you get are going to be highly dependent on who you ask, but I'd say that most students here are way more career focused than students pretty much anywhere else in the country, but that doesn't necessarily translate to 'preppy' \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*a lot of people try to flex their hilternships, but just know that they're neither impressive, hard to get, prestigious, or indicative of any real skills.",

            "comment": "Hello! I am currently a freshman so I may not be the most knowledgeable on this but I completely understand what you are going through as I went through it last year! \n1.) I personally think it depends on where you end up living. I currently live on the Mount Vernon Campus which has more of a classic college campus feel. I am also in a co-curricular program which has allowed me to get to know a lot of people on my campus and make a really great group of friends. In general though it is usually fairly easy to make friends within your residence hall. \n2.) politically there are mentioned but I personally don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s being shoved down my throat. If it\u2019s something you are interested in there are multiple orgs that allow people with same interests to meet up! \n3.) there is a lot of parties as well as clubs around campus that have themed nights almost every week. \n4.) depends on the classes you choose. I think for any college it\u2019s a tough transition where you will quickly discover that even though you have more \u201cfree time\u201d you don\u2019t actually since your assignments take much longer then they do in high school. \n5.) the student body is very mixed in my opinion so there isn\u2019t a category that everyone fits into (other than student) \nHopefully this helps! Feel free to message me with any questions. I would recommend applying to both regular decision and seeing what they offer!",

It is also incredibly difficult academically, but you are taught by some of the best in the country. The type of student who goes here is also likely to be a valuable connection in the future. I would describe the students as mostly wealthy north easterners/west coasters, middle, to lower class but very smart southerners. Wouldn't say preppy but definitely most have a Gatsby/power complex.",

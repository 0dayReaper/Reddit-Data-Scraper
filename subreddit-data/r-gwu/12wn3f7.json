            "comment": "You\u2019re not really going to find many super famous profs at GW bc elected/former elected officials would typically accept offers at ivys. However, a large chunk of gw profs are lifelong bureaucrats. You\u2019ll find a ton of former FSOs, assistant sec of states, usaid directors, and journalists. And a lot of them are more than willing to network and help you in your career since a lot of the time theyre part time profs and still work at their day job too. It should be a good habit to look up profs on LinkedIn to see what kind of stuff they do outside of GW to see if anything sparks your interest. Here\u2019s a quick list of the more well-known profs though:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_George_Washington_University_faculty",

In the public policy school, it is more of a mix between researchers and practitioners.",

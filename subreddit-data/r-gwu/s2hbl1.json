    "postText": "* **208 employees currently in isolation**\n* **Was asked if there are any plans to return to virtual after the 17th:** **no plan to return to online after 17th**. Answered by Sabrina Minor, Interim Vice President\n* **Was asked why GW returned sooner than other schools such as Georgetown and American:** We (GW) had to consider our own unique situation, GW is \"uniquely in a better position\" than the other schools, leadership is very involved, N95 masks are being distributed, booster requirement. Answered by Dean Goldman.\n* **Are in person gatherings that are academically and/or business related allowed?** If the gathering has no direct impact on academics it should be virtual. Answered by Scott Burnotes, VP for Safety and Facilities\n* **There is no antigen test strategy in place yet.** Via Raymond Lucas, professor of Emergency Medicine\n* **When asked about currently public transportation issues:** Acknowledged delays and reduction of service, said: \"WMATA is operating\". Suggested using apps to keep track of bus/train schedules, mentioned discounts that can be used for parking. Answered by Scott Burnotes\n* **When asked about how to enforce masks:** \"Politely remind people to put them on\", nothing specific for mask compliance/enforcement. Answered by Scott Burnotes\n* **Asked if there is a specific positivity rate on campus that would send us back online:** mentioned that they take into consideration local numbers and that the school can \"take a fair amount of cases on campus\". No specific positivity rate given. Answered by Raymond Lucas\n* **Asked what the state of emergency means:** Only applies to medical facilities, went into details that don't really apply to students. I forgot who said this.\n* **A professor in chat said that they had struggled with students not wearing masks, wanted to know what they should do. Dean Goldman told them to report any students in violation of the code of conduct, professor responded with \"We did report the student and were informed no policy was in place.\" Dean Goldman did not reply.**\n\nThat's pretty everything of note that would be applicable to anyone in this sub. They did not respond to the many people asking why extracurricular activities are cancelled while classes are set to continue. If there's something I didn't write up ask and I may have written it down and could let you know. Everything above that is quoted is verbatim rest has been condensed.",

            "comment": "I didn't want to include this in the post because I wanted to provide the information with no bias, but the overall tone of the administration  was very dismissive. Scott Burnotes recommendation to those who rely on public transportation to just download apps and check the schedule is laughable. People who are immunocompromised or vulnerable were told they needed to submit the proper paperwork to get exemptions from coming into the office. They also told people if they live with someone who tested positive that could still come to campus as long as they wear a mask. I know people want in person and that's fine, I won't argue against that, but sitting in that WebEx for the last hour or so was very frustrating to hear them dismiss legitimate concerns from their faculty and staff.",

I would have hoped that they could\u2019ve stressed providing a hybrid learning (for students) or remote (for faculty) environment for those who are more comfortable with that. I\u2019m stunned how dismissive administration is being seeing as the positive rate is 10% right now, and will probably rise as everyone returns to campus.",

In most of these classes they don't take spacing  the students seriously. Last semester, I had a history class in the Funger hall and hardly even showed up to class. This was because all students were so bunched up together, and I didnt want to be basically touching (my elbows were literally rubbing against near by classmates) other students.\n\nThey should consider a primarily hybrid option as it would help maintain the cases at the school as well as the general FB area. As a commuter, its already stressful enough waiting for the delayed metro (which still hasnt been fixed) as well as riding the trains with many people. Some of these people on the trains dont even wear masks! Its truly unfair that GW's staff doesnt take these circumstances into consideration.\n\nIm truly curious to what happens with the COVID policy this semester. Personally, I believe that we will eventually go into hybrid mode due to ever-increasing cases of Omicron. What do you guys think?",

                            "comment": "Alternate perspective to your alternate perspective: That is true, a-lot of professors deal with technical problems with having classes online (connectivity issues, etc). However, please do keep in mind that classes at the university (especially intro ones) typically have an overwhelming amount of students in them. Im a junior in the school of SEAS and most classes have 40 - 100 students.\n\n Even when after COVID started and we went online, online classes had lots of students in them. I took a class with Prof Anker (Great prof btw), my class had roughly 150 students which is absurd lol. Imagine if this was in person? It would be nearly impossible to maintain social distancing guides within the classroom. I get the fact that students want to be in-person for a more engaging experience. However from my exp at this Uni, people want to be in-person because they get the ability to dorm/live near campus. It allows them to attend on campus festivities as well as obtain the freedom they desire. Personally, I believe if classes were online but students had the chance to live on campus, they wouldn't mind it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe need to acknowledge the over-arching problem with COVID. It seems that this will be an ongoing problem for the next couple years as theres a new variant popping out the blue every month or so (Delta, Omicron, IHU, etc). IMO, an insightful solution to this problem would be offering more hybrid/online classes for all subjects at GW. Based off some research I did, GW hardly offers these types of classes (for some reason that is unknown), while other Uni's in the DMV area offer a variety of classes that allows flexibility for students. This would be extremely efficient in the sense that it would maintain covid as well as give students to opportunity to get a head of their degree.",

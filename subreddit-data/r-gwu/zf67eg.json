    "postText": "Has anyone been hearing this lately? At first I thought it was a dog, or the escalator being terrible, but the noise is ridiculously loud and it has to be screaming. It started a few days ago, consistently begins in the morning (around 7) and perpetuates throughout the day (i.e., still going now). Am I going crazy? Do I need therapy or is this real?\n\nEdit: Looked out and did see it was someone screaming, looks like the person has been having a mental health crisis all day. I reported it to the non-emergency line, so hopefully someone can come by and give them help.",

I'll be on the lookout, as at least it's good to know the police are responsive to it. I normally can tolerate stuff like this, but it's just straight screaming, like the person's in physical pain.",

I am interning at Arlington for 2.5 months and I would be needing a place to stay near GWU or in the dorms of GWU. If anybody has any leads or knows about any social media groups that are available for subleasing, please do let me know!",

You\u2019re going to be paying an unnecessarily high premium to live near GW, which is just throwing money away if you don\u2019t need to be near GW for any reason",

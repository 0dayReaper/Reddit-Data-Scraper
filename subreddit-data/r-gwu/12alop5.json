Precovid, many places had bottomless food and drinks, now it\u2019s really just mimosas, bloodies, and maybe a cheap beer\n\nThe food itself usually isn\u2019t that great. The mimosas are all the same cheap champagne and concentrate orange juice across the city. That\u2019s not to say that I don\u2019t love going and getting fucked up at noon on a Saturday, but the hype is just because it gives people an excuse to drink",

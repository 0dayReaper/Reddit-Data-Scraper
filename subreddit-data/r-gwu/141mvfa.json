For as much as GW gets (unfairly) criticized for being \"too liberal,\" I'd say the acceptance and support for LGBTQ+ students, staff, and faculty is one feature that really rings true. No exaggeration. During the Pulse nightclub shootings, the school sent out emails providing students with resources for people they could talk to/work through their reactions with. The American Studies department may as well be the Queer Studies department, given how much queer theory you'll encounter (in most every class). Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (WGSS) and the LGBTQ Health Certificate programs are big beacons.  \n\nI think as far as community for lesbians goes, it's a bit reflective of how the les scene is in DC: there aren't many (if any left?) lesbian bars, compared to gay bars. But there are a lot of queer spaces; you may just have to try a little harder to seek them out. Making friends with literally any WGSS student is a good way to start. :)",

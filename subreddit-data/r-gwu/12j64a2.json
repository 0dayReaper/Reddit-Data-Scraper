    "postText": "24k a year isn\u2019t what I had in mind for my school of top pick. With the financial aid I got from Urich and AU, I would only be paying 9k a year which is way better. Should I try to call gw and tell them I will commit to their school if they give better aid and show them what AU and URich gave me? I really want to go here so any tips/suggestions are greatly appreciated.",

I wouldn\u2019t expect a very drastic change in aid. Maybe a couple thousand.",

They'll ask you to provide additional tax documents and whatnot from your parents (and yourself if you have them) to justify additional aid. Go to financialaid.gwu.edu/changes-circumstances to see what applies to you. I've submitted one every year and have gotten more aid, but it's based on your circumstances. Even if you don't meet what's written on there you can submit with a letter explaining why you need more money and they'll make a decision.",

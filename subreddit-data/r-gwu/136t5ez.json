    "postText": "Has anyone here enrolled into this graduate program? Im considering applying since it offers great flexibility. I am going to choose the business analytics certificate along with the sport management certificate. If anyone has an idea about the sport management and business analytics professors please let me know. Any kind of information is appreciated.\n\nAn off topic question. Im going with this degree in hope that i could find a job at an esports company/organisation as an business or event manager. If that fails i could always look for an business analyst job anywhere else.",

    "postText": "Hi!! If anyone could help me distinct these two schools in my mind as I come to a decision in this last week, I'd be really grateful! (to be clear I mean george washington and university of richmond)  \n\n\nTo note:\n\n\\- I plan to **double major** in Computer Science as my primary objective and then double major. In UofR, I'd double major in leadership studies at Jepson, and in GW I'd double major in IR at Elliott.\n\n\\- I would like a good **social experience**. It takes me a while to get out of my shell, but once I do, I've been told I can be very excitable and social so I'm not \\*too\\* worried about making friends. I've heard both schools have problems when it comes to making friends, with GW having too much of a busy, worky, attitude and UofR being very small and cliche-y.\n\n\\- I'd like good **opportunities**, **job**\\-wise, and **experience**\\-wise. GW being in the heart of D.C. makes job opportunities almost effortless to come by, but I know UofR spends thousands on their career services programs and other alleys for internships/etc. \n\n\\- GW is **costing** me around 16-18k per year, UofR is costing me around 14-16k per year.\n\n\\- With that **cost of living**, my pocket cash is going to be pretty limited at both schools since the money from my job will go almost entirely into tuition. So, I have to factor in that D.C. is more expensive when it comes to going out for fun and travelling.\n\n\\- My **dream job** is a C.S. position with a government entity like the dep. of homeland security or the pentagon, or, if I really end up loving IR, a position as a FSO or a position like it.\n\n\\- With the traditional pen and paper academics, I also value **facilities**. How much attention is really being offered to the CS departments at both schools?\n\n\\- **Safety**, although not at the top of the list, is still a factor. UofR is almost obviously a safe place to live, but I've heard conflicting things about D.C. Some say Foggy Bottom is safe, and others say if you turn the wrong corner, you might get jumped.\n\n\\- I'm not interested in joining frats, but I want to go to parties, concerts, and enjoy **nightlife** in the respective cities. Not like every night, but maybe once a week or every other week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBesides my personal notes, I'm sure there are *many* things that I've missed. Please let me know any of your thoughts. Any comments are greatly appreciated----help me make a decision!!!!!!!!!",

            "comment": "Go with GW. Double majoring in computer science and IA could land you a lot of really great job/internship opportunities in DC. I can\u2019t imagine Rochester has enough internship opportunities for everyone to be able to have one. If you would want to work for the government, you\u2019d be looking to move to DC anyways. \n\nGW\u2019s social environment doesn\u2019t make it incredibly easy to make friends, but most people have close friends, and you always have the luxury of a city with tons of young people if you don\u2019t find your niche on campus. \n\nI can\u2019t really speak to how the CS department is,  I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s as good as large tech universities\u2019. SEH (the building the department is housed and where a lot of the classes are) is definitely the nicest building on campus with really amazing facilities. \n\nWithout knowing much about UofR, GW seems like the obvious choice. The price difference is negligible. Both are 56-72k in student loans is already well above the national average, so Id take the one that would be able to provide you with the best and highest paying job opportunities after graduating. \n\nAlso, if you\u2019re worried about the cost of living, I would definitely jump on any internships or jobs as soon as possible. Try to get an on campus job your first semester, and apply for CS internships throughout the fall.",

            "comment": "I lived there for a short stint before COVID and it was the best housing set up I've had in my entire time at GW. It might have been because I was alone in a corner double room, but it's really not that bad at all. It had a long hallway inside the dorm room with a massive walk in closet, a full kitchen, and then one huge bedroom/common room and a smaller seperate side bedroom at the end of the hall. I ended up turning the extra room into a yoga space and a guest bed for if friends crashed over night, and hung up a hammock in the walk in and made a super comfy reading lounge.  There was plenty of room to push together the beds and make a king size mega bed, and a sitting area for chilling and and a desk area for studying. Also I really don't know why you need to be any closer to the metro? That's hella close, it's just over a five minute walk and less than half a mile. Your post is coming off super entitled and privileged and I really suggest you get some perspective and flexibility. TL;DR 2109 F is not that bad and complaining about it and thinking you're above walking a few blocks is a bad look.",

Unfortunately that building is hella old so the heating system is HORRIBLE. The building is surrounded by water pipes and when the heat is turned on they make A LOT of noise. It is like constant banging noises coming from the pipes it is not like you can wear your headphones and you no longer hear it, no matter what, it is horrible and quite annoying. How do i know? I lived in that building and during winter I could not sleep properly due to the pipes. Did Gw do anything to fix the issue though? No the building is still the same",

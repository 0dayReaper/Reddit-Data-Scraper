            "comment": "A few ideas:\n- Pay per ride instead of getting a weekly/monthly pass. The passes require that you ride a lot to get your money\u2019s worth\n- Ask your employer if there is a pre-tax transit benefit (taken out of your paycheck) or a transit subsidy (paid by the employer)\n- Take Metrobus or Circulator bus as a more affordable option\n- Explore hybrid work options to go into the office fewer days per week\n- Talk to your supervisor about shifting your working hours to avoid peak rates",

The Summer has a tendency to be really packed and sometimes if ur at an event and there\u2019s metro near by. You will be waiting at least 30 min in line to even get on the metro.",

Two times were on bikeshare one time on my personal bike.",

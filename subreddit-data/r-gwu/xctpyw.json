    "postText": "Just started at a grad student in the engineering department (online program). My company is helping financially but not covering the whole way. Do you know of research/TA/funding opportunities available to online grad students? My professional background is engineering but I'm certainly open to other areas.\n\nAny tips beyond jobs/fellowships portal for where to look or who to reach out to? Thanks &amp; Raise High!",

You can go to the online program site to learn more about their current research. Additionally you can reach out to the advising office and career services to see if they can direct you to opportunities.",

            "comment": "So there\u2019s three types of funding through the school/department for SEAS grad students: research assistants (GRA), TAs (GTA), and graders. Officially speaking, to be a GRA or GTA you need to be a full time grad student (9 credits) and have no other outside employment. The former is pretty much nonnegotiable (though it *might* depend on the department), the latter has workarounds. For the most part, these are either directly or indirectly sponsored by professors, so you\u2019ll want to cozy up to one and join their lab. Most of them understand that living on a $25k stipend is not sustainable in DC and will essentially not ask questions about any outside employment that you may or may not have. Most departments will also usually solicit applications for TAs once or twice a year, but the full time enrollment caveat still applies. As a GRA/GTA, you\u2019ll be expected to work 20-30 hours per week and in exchange will get your tuition fully covered as well as a stipend of around $10-15k per semester. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any *official* restrictions on online GRA/GTA but you\u2019d have to find a professor willing to let you do fully remote research or work with your department to find an online class to TA. I think online GRA is at least somewhat of a possibility, I don\u2019t think online GTA is very likely. \n\nGraders are just responsible for grading papers, not teaching. Some departments use them, some don\u2019t. I know that my department hires graders who are part time students, yours may or may not. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s possible to be a grader as an online student, again it\u2019ll probably be up to the department. Applications usually go out a month or so before the start of each semester. Not sure what the pay is like, I\u2019ve never actually done this.",

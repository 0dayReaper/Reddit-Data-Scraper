    "postText": "As mentioned in the caption, I just got accepted as a transfer into the Milken School of Public Health as an exercise science major (pre-medical studies). This is for spring 2023.\n\nDoes anyone have any insight as to what to expect as an exercise science major? Any advice? Recommendations? \nI\u2019ve heard nothing but good things from this program. \n\nDoes anyone know if theirs any type of orientation for newly accepted students? (Transfer or traditional) \n\nAdditionally, I am a veteran, and I will be using my GI Bill. For veterans, how has your experience been at GW so far?",

Undergraduate science = so bad I decided to do a post bac instead. \n\nI was a traditional student though so take that however you will. If you have space for a minor I recommend EHS. Feel free to pm me if you want to discuss specific classes etc",

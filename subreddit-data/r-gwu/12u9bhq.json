    "postText": "I am a prospective student for GW from a suburb of Philadelphia. I want to be able to get back home on weekends for my gf so we can see each other often. I don\u2019t care if I have to sit on a 4 hour train, gives me time to sleep or study. However, cost is important.\n\nMy ideal would be leaving Friday night / Saturday morning and coming back Sunday night. How much does this cost through public transportation? I need to take a train to Philly and then take another train to a suburb. I don\u2019t want to doxx myself but it\u2019s not super far, 20-30 minutes by car.\n\nI heard something about Amtrak being cheap if you go at midnight. Does anyone have recommendations and ways to make this work without paying too much?\n\nThank you!",

I have a friend take the bus to PA a few weeks ago and it was quite cheap; DC has a lot of dedicated lines like this. For example, the DC-NYC route is only like $30 or so.",

I do have some questions, however.\n\n1) I\u2019ve heard about some tickets being ~$5-10 if you take Amtrak between 12am-5am. Is this true? Any stipulations?\n\n2) I keep hearing different prices for tickets. Is $90 really accurate? Or is that depending on timing/when you book it? Cause for a broke college kid, $1400 extra expenses is a bit of big deal haha.\n\n3) As for time, the train offers me time to do homework and/or study. Being home on weekends would be limiting but I feel like I could still make really good friends in classes and be close to professors during the weekdays. Or is this an ignorant take?\n\nPoint to note: I was accepted to a closer college, Haverford college, and it\u2019s probably my top pick. Both would be an amazing school to attend. However, Haverford would cost me a lot more since I got less than I did at GW. It might cost me an extra $15k per year for the first 2 then an extra $30k per year for the last two to attend Haverford. I refuse to lose my relationship for reasons I really don\u2019t want to get into, and both of these schools im happy with, so im okay factoring in location to my college decision (cause even if I lost that relationship, im still okay at the college I chose). So while a closer school is possible, cost is probably not worth it.",

Amtrak is really convenient, but it would still be a lot to deal with on a frequent basis. \n\nIt looks like there are the $10 tickets for the 3:15-5:10 am train and the 10 pm-12:06 am train. Depending on what regional rail line you would take, there could be one running by the time you get to 30th St. But you wouldn\u2019t be able to take the Metro to get to Union bc that\u2019d be too early. If you took the one that got to 30th St at 12:06 am, I think that would be too late/early for the regional rail.\n\nSo I think it would be a better bet to take a train during a regular time, and those start at $19.\n\nAlso consider the fact that there are often delays on Amtrak.",

                    "comment": "$20 ticket is still feasible. $30+ is getting too pricy lol. And if I can\u2019t take metro, cab could work. Do you know how pricey cabs/Uber is in the area from foggy bottom to Union? Especially early in the morning (to catch that 3:15 or something like that)",

Or could I book months of tickets in advance?\n\nAlso, will timings work out with other trains like septa to get to suburbs? Or will it be at like midnight to get cheap tickets?",

            "comment": "So the super cheap fares are between $10 and $20 each way, plus the cost of SEPTA or whatever second train you end up taking. These fares tend to sell out fairly quickly, especially on popular weekends and during peak commuting hours. If you\u2019re willing to travel early in the morning (before 7AM) or late at night (after 7PM), you should have no problem getting these cheap fares if you book at least 4-6 weeks in advance for a normal weekend. For a holiday weekend, book several months in advance and/or be prepared to pay more. You can book Amtrak tickets up to 11 months in advance, just be mindful that these cheap \u201csaver\u201d fares are nonrefundable (though you can get 75% of your fare back as an Amtrak voucher). \n\nThere are also some options for passes, they\u2019re more expensive per trip than a saver fare during off peak hours but they\u2019re cheaper than a normal/peak fare and you have more flexibility in when you travel and when you book. The 10 ride pass is about $400 for 10 one way trips in a 45 day period. The main benefit of this is you can take any train that has an open (coach class) seat regardless of what it\u2019s selling for, so you don\u2019t need to book as early",

And $10 to $20 is perfect for a broke college student lol. And I can travel any time, my sleep schedule is non existent. And thank you for the refund notice, that\u2019s really helpful.\n\nYeah that\u2019s $40 a trip which is expensive for me tbh. Especially because that would only last 5 weeks. $400 per 5 weeks is $4160 a year. Definitely not plausible as an excess expense with all the other costs haha. But thank you for the info anyways.",

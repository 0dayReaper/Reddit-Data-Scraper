    "postText": "About to retake gen chem 1 (taking it over the summer rn and things aren\u2019t looking hot). I have Professor Razunguzwa. You need to get a passing grade (55+) on both the lecture and lab separately and the lecture is graded based on the average of three exams (excluding ALEKS). I\u2019ve never felt so suicidal and academically challenged in a class before. Even considering giving up on my bio major entirely. \n\nNext semester\u2019s gen chem 1 professors are Gail Clements, Andrea Cook, Vladislav Sadtchenko (and Tabitha Razunguzwa). If anyone has had these professors before for this class, can you please let me know what they were like and how the class is graded? I don\u2019t mind DMs either, I am in a very bad place right now and hope that maybe I will have a better chance in the fall :)",

A lot of students from area colleges take their Chems over summer at Frederick Community College, Frederick, MD.  Smaller classes and they\u2019re there to help you succeed.  I took inorganic I &amp; II last summer.  Each were 5 weeks long and earned A and B in them.  Currently taking a Comp Sci course at NOVA this summer.",

She's more organic chemistry focused (has her PhD in orgo) and honestly doesn't know much about gen chem, or at least is really bad at teaching/explaining it. A lot of the time when students asked her a question regarding the content being taught in class, she would need to confirm her answer with another professor to make sure she was giving the right answer. Sometimes she would just give the wrong answer and move on. I kind of found that annoying because imo, if you're teaching a class, you should know enough about the general information to answer students correctly.\n\nIn terms of grading and tests, she is super strict and offers no extra credit or curve.\n\nShe honestly made me hate  chemistry. All the gen chem professors are terrible.\n\nOverall, I'm personally not a fan of Clements. If I could do gen chem over again, I'd probably take it with Prof R. A lot of my friends had her and had a semi-pleasant experience. Clements is a nice person but not a good prof.",

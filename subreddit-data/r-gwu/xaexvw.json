So, in short, are you happy you went/go here, and should I be excited? Also, what are the people, food, dating, housing, social scene, etc. like? Thanks so much!",

The professors are top notch.   \n In the past the administration did shoot itself in the foot by misrepresenting values used to calculate ratings.\n\nIf you're planning to go to medical school, and not exceptionally strong in sciences with AP credits to place out of the joke weed-out intro courses, I would avoid it.  I had colleagues who were barely passing get straight As in Drexel after transferring.",

I also managed a 2.67 GPA that second semester, so while you may have a ton of opportunities, don\u2019t spread yourself too thin.",

            "comment": "I went as an adult So YMMV, but Ioved it. However, it really is what you make of it. The professors are top notch and generally want to help people who reach out. I made many amazing connections through just going the extra mile and asking them for help, and it REALLY has paid off professionally. So, if you want to just get a degree and show up, it probably isn\u2019t the school for you at such a high cost (even with aid). If you want to make use of the faculty, and the proximity to downtown DC to build I future in some form of government, NGO, or lobbying, then it is an amazing school if you put in the work.\n\nAlso, again, this comes from someone who attended as a 25 y/o, but I generally really liked the student body. They were smart, interesting, and fairly diverse in experience and personality, but all fairly nice and pretty regular. Again, I never lived on campus or did dorm life, but this was my general finding in class interactions. Personally, of the schools in the area, I found through my interactions that (most) Georgetown kids were absolutely INSUFFERABLE to be around, (most) American kids were just kind of\u2026strange? Might be the word, and George Mason kids were generally awesome people to be around and talk to, but the campus is just so much further out from DC and if point 1 I made is important to you, then it isn\u2019t the school for you.\n\nAgain, take ALL of this with a grain of salt. I went as a 25 year old and never had the \u201dtraditional\u201d college experience, but overall I loved GW, I found the students to be good people for the most part, and the faculty connections really paid off for me professionally. Would recommend if the financial aid is generous enough and you make the effort.",

My friends in STEM like CS and engineering don\u2019t really like the curriculums because it\u2019s not well planned but at least the advisors are good. \n\nAs for friends, be prepared to stand your ground and meet some very annoying people .

Otherwise, there were many things that made me really dislike GW, one being the student body. It\u2019s hard to find someone genuinely down to earth and I experienced some mild bullying my freshman year which threw me off for the rest. If you want the proximity to the national mall, go to GW, but otherwise there\u2019s NOTHING GW has that another school doesn\u2019t do better. It\u2019s been consistently falling in the rankings and after a horrible President a lot has been left to be desired. I would have chosen NYU if I could go back.\n\nAlso, they treat their undergrads like shit and definitely care more about their grad students.",

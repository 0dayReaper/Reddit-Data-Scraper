I also had a brother who was also in college at the same time so I should still owe what I owed the past 2 years. I will be living on campus and they are charging me literally almost 10,000. Thats almost quadruple the amount of what I usually owe. 10,000 is my mothers income for an entire year. I rely on jobs in DC to keep me afloat myself. \n\nSo my question to you redditors is: What the fuck did the reduction in tuition even do? Why are we all paying exponentially more than ever? \n\nI knew this would be the case because GW is literally satanic but if anyone can help me out with this stupid numbers game please let me know. I am open to DM you my exact financial aid package too.",

Right now the market is not doing well, and withdrawing their invested endowment money would be a net negative loss. The university is also required spread the spending out of the endowment over a long period of time so that it benefits future students.\n\nThat's not taking into account the part of the quasi-endowment they've probably used to support operating costs and things like the Thurston renovations.",

Universities are obligated (often both by the donors and university policies) to ensure the endowment is equal for present and future students. Endowments for any university must be maintined in perpetuity so that the purchasing power of the endowment is the same or more each year. That's why univerisites have strict regulations on how much of the endowment they can take out per year, which is usually a single digit percentage. The actual endowment money cannot just be liquiated on a whim, it must be maintained long term.\n\nThat's also why they invest the endowment, so it either maintains or grows in value, a bank account could easily loose value every year if inflation outpaces interest.\n\nThey can spend the profits of the investment however they want, but right now because of the market the endowment portfolio is probably negative or in the best case sceanario has had its' profits wiped.\n\nFor example, they've invested $1 billion. If they take out $300 million (the projected shortfall) they cannot gain that back in a reasonable amount of time - the unrestricted endowment has now lost 30% of it's value. That's not giving all generations of students an equal endowment and it breaks university financial policy.\n\nEdit: Here's where you can read more about endowments and perpetuity \n\n[https://www.pnc.com/insights/corporate-institutional/manage-nonprofit-enterprises/starting-an-endowment.html](https://www.pnc.com/insights/corporate-institutional/manage-nonprofit-enterprises/starting-an-endowment.html)\n\nEdit: I was able to find the GW definition for Quasi Endowment, which is what you're calling \"unrestricted\" Hopefully it clears some things up for you. \n\nQuasi endowment funds are funds functioning as an endowment that are established by the institution from either donor or institutional funds, and will be retained and invested rather than expended. The quasi endowment must retain the purpose and intent as specified by the donor or source of the original funds, and earnings may be expended only for those purposes. Since they are established by the institution rather than by an external source, the principal may be expended as stipulated by the donor.\n\n**Even in the quasi endowment the original funds must be used how the donor intended.**",

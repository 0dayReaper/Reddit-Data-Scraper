    "postText": "Hi! I'm planning on applying RD for this upcoming cycle, GW's one of my top choices, and I was just wondering as to if need-based aid stacks with merit scholarship? I believe I should get a decent scholarship (I've got a 34 on the ACT and a 4.3 GPA, and I'm applying for CS), so I just wanted to know if that would cut down on the remaining tuition after need-based. TIA",

The dirty secret about \u201cmerit-based aid\u201d is that GW and every other school sends their applicant pool to a firm who come up with how much money to offer each person. Enough so that you choose GW over cheaper options (need based) or better options (merit based) but not enough that they lose too much $$. \n\nJust apply, see what you get, and figure it out later.",

When you get your financial package, I highly recommend pushing for more money to the financial aid office",

Private loans are prob your best bet. The government also never gave me a subsidized loan it was always unsubsidized. I feel like any aid that was given to me was a slap in my face.",

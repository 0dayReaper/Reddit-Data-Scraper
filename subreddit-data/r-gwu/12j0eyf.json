Obviously there\u2019s PCs in the library but as it\u2019s coming up to exam season I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get quite busy - any help would be really appreciated :))",

Go to the 1st floor in the library, right by the create digital studio. There are tons of Mac desktops and others all around. A lot of people don't know about it, so it may be the perfect place for you to go\n\nSadly GW does not offer a rentable laptop program, I don't know of much else you could do.",

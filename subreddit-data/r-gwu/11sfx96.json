    "postText": "Hey all, just got accepted to the MPP program and I am wondering about current/past student\u2019s experience with financial aid. I was offered a scholarship, but it\u2019s quite small relative to the cost and I would still have to take out significant loans. How much did you receive for your MPP financial aid package, and how common is it to negotiate the amount?",

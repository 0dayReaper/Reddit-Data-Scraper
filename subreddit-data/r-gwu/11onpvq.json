    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI hope this isn\u2019t against sub rules. I\u2019m running for SA Prez. It would be really cool if you guys could sign the petition for me to be a candidate. \n\nhttps://gwu.campuslabs.com/engage/submitter/form/start/582188\n\nMy name is Redzuan and I\u2019m a junior from Malaysia.\n\nIf you want to know my platform before doing so I\u2019m more than happy to go into more detail.\n\n3 main goals I\u2019m aiming for:\n\n1. Bring back Pass/Fail (the one we had during covid).\n\n2. More strategic funding for clubs. Instead of large events that people don\u2019t go to or just grab a slice a pizza and leave, my strategy for more school spirit is to focus on clubs in the hopes that people make it part of their routine. Hopefully this translates to a closer relationship a student has to the school.\n\n3. Stability. A bit ambiguous, but the SA has been fighting and suing each other causing a scene and being dramatic at the expense of students. I\u2019m aiming for creating a culture that shuns that and doesn\u2019t tolerate it.\n\nI know all this is easier said than done, but I am genuinely passionate about this and I\u2019m welcome to hearing criticisms or answering questions.\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t want to spam, but I really do believe in the goals I have and genuinely believe that they will help students at GW.",

This seems 1) incredibly unlikely to happen, I don\u2019t think SA would have any say over that and 2) seems kinda like a \u201celect me and get an extra hour as recess/ice cream for lunch every day\u201d type of campaign goal.",

                    "comment": "These are fair questions. 1) you are right in saying the SA doesn\u2019t have the power. But there is precedence. During the covid year, they initially removed the pass/fail after a semester but after the SA pushed for it, it came back. \n\n2) You could see it that way, but the SA is historically stingy with allocations to clubs and generous to events. A couple hundred to a club does wonders compared to thousands of dollars for events. This is honestly an experiment. There\u2019s no guarantee that it will work and will generate more school \u2018spirit.\u2019 But at this point I believe it\u2019s worth a try",

You can\u2019t control the events that are being made and you also can\u2019t cherry pick what Club gets funding, it\u2019s illegal.  \n\nAlso I have no idea how you\u2019re gonna do stability because you can\u2019t control the narcissist personalities at GW and their hero egos.",

                    "comment": "That\u2019s true. But you have to remember, it doesn\u2019t have to be the President VS the Finance committee. If I get elected with these promises, it\u2019s a clear mandate that the GW students support such measures, and we can work together to implement these policies. I\u2019m trying to run for a school-wide position to highlight these issues and bring up my proposed solutions. If I thought I could achieve this by being a senator I would\u2019ve ran for that position. But what kind of position would I be negotiating from vs if I\u2019m the president and bring up these ideas.\n\nAnd yes, the SA is rife with people who only want to boost their egos. I pray I\u2019m not one of them. I believe my intentions to be pure, and I\u2019m far too indifferent to pretend to be passionate about the problems I wish to tackle. On the question of how I\u2019m going to ensure stability, it\u2019s all about the culture that im trying to create. Starting from the top, I\u2019ll have a zero tolerance policy for drama at the cabinet level. Whether this trickles down to the senate is a good question. But this is a solution I am proposing and I\u2019m genuinely open to hearing more detailed criticisms and advice. If you have something better please do tell me. I\u2019m trying to fix the problem, rather than push a solution.",

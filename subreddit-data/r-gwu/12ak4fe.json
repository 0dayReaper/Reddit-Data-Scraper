I\u2019ve had the opportunity to speak with some people that went to SIS, but not Elliott. Would anyone be able to share their experiences? Or any experiences about GW in general, not just Elliott. :) thank you!",

            "comment": "I would be happy to speak more specifics if you have additional questions, but overall I would say you wouldn\u2019t regret coming to Elliot. I also had the opportunity of choosing between SIS and Elliot - you probably would do great in both but I think Elliot has some advantages. I\u2019ve had the fortune of taking some higher level classes early on in GW and the experience has been amazing. \n\nDefinitely take advantage of the fact that you\u2019re going to a school with generally more reachable professors than your typical state school. I have yet to meet a GW professor who wouldn\u2019t want to help/talk to kids, and if they\u2019re busy they usually are happy to accommodate by scheduling meetings with you. It\u2019s actually a great way to check on future classes and subjects you\u2019re interested in taking. Beyond that feel free to add to the thread or direct message if you have specific questions. I could answer other reasons why I chose Elliot/GW over SIS/American. Welcome to GW!",

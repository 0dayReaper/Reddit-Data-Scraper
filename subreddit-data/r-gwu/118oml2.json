I plan to major in CompSci and I was wondering if gw is a good school for my major. Also, how are the professors in that department and how are the internship opportunities there?  Are credits easy to transfer or will I have to go through bs? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease lmk if there\u2019s anything I should know about!",

            "comment": "It\u2019s a decent but not amazing program, chances are probably 50/50 that your state school has a better CS program. GW has historically not been known for their STEM programs (especially at the undergraduate level) but there\u2019s been a boatload of money poured into SEAS in recent years so they are on the upswing but still plenty of room to grow. The best selling point is probably that the department is relatively small, so as opposed to a larger state school, you won\u2019t have CS courses with 200+ other people. As for internships, I can say anecdotally that the last several companies I\u2019ve worked for did not recruit heavily from GW or attend their career fairs (at the expense of other area schools like UMD and GMU), but that\u2019s by no means to say that it\u2019s impossible to get an internship as a GWU CS student. A big downside in my opinion is that GWU (or at least SEAS) doesn\u2019t have a co-op program. \n\nTl;dr: decent program, probably not worth it for CS unless it\u2019s significantly cheaper than your other options",

The career fairs at UMD are put on by the department or college and you have to be a student in that department/college to attend. I remember way back when I was a student at UMD and couldn\u2019t attend the CS career fair because I wasn\u2019t a CS major",

Similar skill sets, but you get better pay out of college due to data science being more common as a masters than as an undergrad. \n\nI personally have really liked my professors, but I will recommend that you do your due diligence with rate my professor. \n\nI have been getting a ton of internship opportunities as a relatively average student, lots of places in DC looking for interns (at least in data science) Depending where you go though you may need to get a clearance. (Lots of military contractors hiring comp-sci/data sci people)\n\nGW took by far the most credits out of any school that accepted me, everything except for classes I changed to pass/fail during covid. They also gave me the most financial aid.\n\nSo far, I\u2019m loving GW as a transfer. I\u2019ve made a lot of friends and the location is awesome.",

            "comment": "I highly recommend it.  I did both my bachelors and masters at GW in CSCI and was also a Teaching Assistant.\n\nYes, ranking wise, many State schools have a higher ranking for their CS department.\n\nIn reality, it doesn't matter.\n\nGW's CS department is small affording one more opportunities to work with professors.  I was already doing undergraduate research my Sophomore year of college and continued it onto masters.  This allowed me to also become a TA to have my Masters in theory paid for.\n\nFor job prospects, our career services is poor.  There are two great ways to get around this.\n\nThe first way is to perform internships for larger companies that have clear employment pathways for new graduates.  This will likely yield a good starting salary.\n\nThe second way is to get any first job in CS for an underpaid salary to establish continuous employment, and then change jobs 6months in and double or triple your salary; it doesn't even have to be in the field you want to work in, just similar enough.  The reason this works is that many employers don't want to take a \"risk\" with someone with no job experience unless they have clear pathways for graduating students.\n\nWhen hiring, no one cares about alma mater and GPA after your first job.\n\nThat said, since this is DC, I highly recommend GW if you're into cyber security; with Shmoocon just one mile up the street every winter, that is your best bet for finding Tier A jobs if you have bots scalping for tickets when they drop in the Fall.",

Opened up a ton more doors in my field (politics) relative to my previous university, and I loved the urban campus. My one friend who is CS has gotten a bunch of good summer internships, but most have been outside DC (NY and WA, I think)\n\nAnecdotally, the best way to gauge whether a credit would be transferred was how close the name was to another equivalent GW course, even if the syllabus didn\u2019t match lol",

Professors and facilities are top notch, and many of our professors came from top tier schools or worked for FAANG.\n\nThat said, I was not a fan of the biology department, but that's not CS.  If you're planning anything pre-professional, I would not recommend GW, since for pre-professional programs like pre-med and pre-law, GPA matters greatly and many struggle at GW.  I had a colleague who was almost failing pre-med at GW, and at Drexel they got straight As.",

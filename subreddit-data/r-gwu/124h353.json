    "postText": "Im really confused between these 2 choices. The tuition with scholarship for both programs is similar so thats not bothering me. But, the course work and job opportunities after is what Im curious about. The course curriculum for MS looks somewhat similar for both courses but recently I have been reading that gwu DS field is a hot mess.\nWhile stevens has a good reputation for CS Im clueless about DS. Id appreciate it if you could point out the key pros and cons of these 2.",

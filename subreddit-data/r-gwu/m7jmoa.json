    "postText": "I noticed that a lot of resources are available for free for GW students, but not everyone is aware of them. So I tried gathering all the ones I know of in this post to help other students to use every cent payed in tuition :)\n\nI\u2019ll focus only on resources outside the university, because you can find most (if not all) of them [here](https://business.gwu.edu/current-students/graduate/student-engagement/resources-for-current-students).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* News subscriptions:\n\n[The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal](https://library.gwu.edu/currentnews)\n\n[Washington Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/portal/georgewashingtonuWA)\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Software (my favorite category):\n\n[GW\u2019s VPN](https://it.gwu.edu/virtual-private-network-vpn) it allows you access the internet as if you were inside GW from anywhere in the world.\n\n[Microsoft Office 365 plus; Word, Powerpoint, Excel and more.](https://it.gwu.edu/microsoft-office-365-free-gw-community-0) More info: [https://it.gwu.edu/microsoft-365](https://it.gwu.edu/microsoft-365) (I still prefer LibreOffice, but unfortunately it\u2019s your choice :)\n\n[Adobe Creative Cloud](https://gwu-myit.onbmc.com/dwp/app/#/knowledge/KBA00001405/rkm) PhotoShop, AfterEffect, Acrobat reader, and so so so much more.\n\n[WebEx](https://gwstudent.webex.com/webappng/sites/gwstudent/dashboard?siteurl=gwstudent) Video conferences (like Zoom). I\u2019m assuming everyone is already using it at this point.\n\n[Zoom](https://it.gwu.edu/zoom) Video conferences (like WebEx).\n\n[SAS](https://instruction.gwu.edu/sas-statistical-analysis-software) an advanced analytical software.^(1)\n\n[Symantec Anti-virus](https://my.gwu.edu/mod/downloads)\n\n[Jabber](https://my.gwu.edu/mod/downloads) (I honestly don\u2019t know what is this, seems like another WebEx/Zoom kind of thing\\]\n\n[TeamViewer](https://my.gwu.edu/mod/downloads) A software used to access a laptop/desktop from another device. You can use it to access GW\u2019s computer labs, and I believe you can set it so that you can access your computer from somewhere else.\n\n[FileZilla](https://my.gwu.edu/mod/downloads) SCP/SFTP (file transfer protocol) client\n\n[Putty and WinSCP](https://my.gwu.edu/mod/downloads) Putty is an ssh client and WinSCP is an SCP/SFTP client (I heard that FileZilla is better than WinSCP, but I never tried either)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* TV\n\n[Xfinity on Campus](https://www.xfinityoncampus.com/)\n\n[HBO GO](http://play.hbogo.com/login)\n\n[MAX GO](http://www.maxgo.com/#movies/)\n\nIf you want more info on them, I found them here: [https://it.gwu.edu/tv](https://it.gwu.edu/tv)\n\n[Kanopy](https://gwu.kanopy.com/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Cloud Storage\n\n[Box](https://gwu.box.com/) unlimited storage\n\n[Google drive](https://drive.google.com/) unlimited storage\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Fax?\n\n[eFax](https://gwu.onbmc.com/arsys/forms/onbmc-s/SRS:ServiceRequestConsole/?mode=submit&amp;F303900000=4&amp;F303900900=SRGAA5V0F9ZOTAOM6KK3OLKOCF65E4&amp;F303906700=0&amp;F303902000=0&amp;F303902100=0) I\u2019m not sure who still uses fax, but apparently you can request sending a fax from your computer.\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Transportation:\n\n[Lyft and Capital Bike share](https://transportation.gwu.edu/alternative-transportation-services) I really, really, really hope this will get extended even after COVID-19.\n\n[Capital bike share](https://transportation.gwu.edu/capital-bikeshare-partnership) this is a discount in case the previous one gets cancelled.\n\n[ibuy+](https://ibuy.gwu.edu/ibuy-travel) It seems like some kind of a discount portal for car rentals, flights, rails, and hotels. Could be huge but I never tried it before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Training\n\n[LinkedIn Learning](https://careers.seas.gwu.edu/resources/linkedin-learning/) Out of everything in the list, this one is my absolute favorite. It was called [lynda.com](https://lynda.com) before, and it\u2019s basically a huge resource for professional online learning courses with certificates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, if anyone found something I didn\u2019t please feel free to share  it with us. Also don't hesitate to criticize anything I wrote, but only under one rule: tell me how to improve it :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*You have to be using GW\u2019s network (internet) or use the VPN.\n\n^(1) you need to request it to get a license/key.",

A lot of them will require you to request the access by email and/or be on GW network (GW Wireless or GW VPN). So to spare you from adding \u2018\\*\u2019 and '^(1') after each one, check this link ([https://www.seas.gwu.edu/software-licenses](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/software-licenses)) to check :)\n\nNote: some softwares don\u2019t have a special webpage for how to download them, so you\u2019ll have to refer to this link to know how.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince there are too many softwares to list in plain text, I decided to divide them into the best subsections I had in mind:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The ones I used before:\n\n[Solid Edge](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/solid-edge) CAD\n\n[SolidWorks](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/solidworks-student-license) A brother from a different mother for Solid Edge.\n\n[ANSYS](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/ansys) Engineering simulations &amp; 3D design. Really good, and really powerful.\n\n[Multisim](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/multisim) A circuit simulator, I think all ECE majors have to use it starting sophomore year. Really helpful to test your circuit to prevent blowing up your actual circuit (which still happened in my case)\n\n[AutoDesk](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/autodesk) All the AutoDesk software you could dream of. To name a few: AutoCAD (with all of its different versions), 3ds Max (although I still prefer blender), Revit, and others that I\u2019ve never heard before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The ones I heard about before, and wanted to try (but haven\u2019t yet):\n\n[Azure Dev tools](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/microsoft-azure) This could be huge. I mean like, huge huge. The only problem is I don\u2019t actually know what is it. But as soon as I do, I\u2019ll update this comment.\n\n[Oracle academy](https://seascf.seas.gwu.edu/oracle-academy-subscription) It seems like a computer science educational resources (MySQL, Java, Solaris OS, etc.) provided by Oracle.\n\n[VMWare](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/vmware) Most of VMWare\u2019s software are available for us, including their virtual machine.\n\n[Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/wolfram-mathematica) In simple words, it\u2019s a powerful calculator.\n\n[LabVIEW](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/labview) LabVIEW is commonly used for data acquisition, instrument control, and industrial automation &lt;&lt;&lt; I took this from Wikipedia because I heard it\u2019s a really great software and many researches use it, so I felt it deserved a better summary than what I\u2019d come up with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The ones I never heard about before, but got a slight interest in them while making this list:\n\n[Qualtrics](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/qualtrics) A tool to analyze online surveys.\n\n[Tecplot](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/tecplot) CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) Visualization &amp; Analysis Tools\n\n[ArcGIS](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/arcgis) A geographic information system for working with maps and geography (what is this thing doing in SEAS?)\n\n\\[Altair Hyperworks:[https://www.seas.gwu.edu/altair-hyperworks](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/altair-hyperworks)\\] A complete CAE (computer-aided engineering) software\n\nCoventorWare: For designing MEMS (Microelectromechanical systems, not memes)\n\nMathType: apparently it\u2019s an add-on for word/pages and powerpoint/keynote for writing Mathematical notations??!\n\nMINEQL+: A tool for performing, visualizing, and managing chemical equilibrium calculations.\n\nOPNET: Network simulator\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The ones I still have no idea what are they actually even after searching for them to make the list (this list was also too long, so it has been sub-sub-divided):\n\n\\-   Cool names:\n\n[Abaqus](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/abaqus) Finite element analysis and computer-aided engineering (CAE)\n\n[Simio](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/simio) Intelligent object-based simulation\n\n[Xilinx Vivado](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/xlinix-vivado) synthesis and analysis of HDL (hardware description language) designs\n\nCadence: designing integrated circuits, systems on chips (SoCs) and printed circuit boards.\n\nQUARC: It generates real-time code directly from Simulink-designed controllers and runs it in real-time on the Windows target \u2013 all without digital signal processing or without writing a single line of code. (personally I liked the underlined part. I still don\u2019t know what it does though :)\n\nSilvaco: electronic design automation (EDA) and technology CAD (TCAD) software and semiconductor design IP (SIP)\n\nSynopsis: silicon design and verification, silicon intellectual property and software security and quality.\n\nSAP2000: Analysis engine and design tools for engineers working on transportation, industrial, public works, sports, and other facilities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-   half decent names:\n\n[Advanced Design System (ADS)](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/ads-agilent-technologies) An integrated design environment to designers of RF (radio frequency) electronic products\n\n[Minitab](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/minitab) To quote SEAS: \u201cMinitab provides convenient features that streamline your workflow, a comprehensive set of statistics for exploring your data, and graphs for communicating your success.\u201d\n\nAGI STK: A platform for analyzing and visualizing complex systems in the context of your mission. Interact with data from platforms across the aerospace, defense, telecommunications, and other industries. Simulate your intended missions\u00a0and communicate the results with reports, graphs, and stunning 3D animations.\n\nComsol CKL: Multiphysics simulation\n\nENSOFT: It appears to be a company which has multiple softwares. I don\u2019t know if we can get specific one/ones, or all of them. Neither do I know what any of them does.\n\nPalisades DecisionTools Suite: Risk managing and decision making.\n\nPro-Engineer (now called PTC Creo): Integrated 3D CAD/CAM/CAE software\n\nStructurePoint: Multi-purpose structural modeling and finite element analysis software for two- and three-dimensional buildings and structures.",

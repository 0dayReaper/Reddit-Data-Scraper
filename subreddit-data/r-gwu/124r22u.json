    "postText": "I've been admitted into the Security Policy Studies MA this fall, and was wondering whether many graduate students study abroad and if it worth it. I studied abroad in undergrad and enjoyed it, but doing it in grad school seems trickier.\n\nI would plan on going to Asia, so if anyone has any experience doing it in grad school let me know!",

            "comment": "Lots of grad students study abroad, just not on the longer programs that undergrads do bc you can't really do that with a grad student schedule. I don't think GW has any, but you could check out some of the programs at other schools that are led by university faculty. Those are usually pretty short and you can do them outside of when classes usually run. There are a bunch that are topic specific so you should be able to get credit toward your degree.",

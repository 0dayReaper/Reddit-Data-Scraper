    "postText": "I need a single dorm. Due to sensory issues, if I had a roommate who made any noise at all at night, I\u2019d be unable to sleep. Not just snoring. Heavy breathing, sniffling, yawning, they would drive me insane. Misophonia seems to be the closest thing to what I have, though my diagnosis is for autism (and ADHD but I don\u2019t think that is what\u2019s causing this).\n\nAs for earbuds at night, I would have to always be wearing them in my own room. It\u2019s not just I can\u2019t sleep, these sounds make me go insane. If my roommate made any sounds, I would have to ALWAYS wear them. There would be no place I could go to relax and my roommate and I\u2019s relationship would be in the gutter since I\u2019d basically always be ignoring them.\n\nTherefore, if GWU came back to me and said I couldn\u2019t get a solo dorm, I would drop out of the school. I need to sleep and an apartment in the DC area is too expensive. So I applied for DSS and need it to be finalized before housing is decided and all the singles are taken.\n\nI got an email 5 days ago saying that a DSS-identified staff will reach to me shortly to schedule an appointment so we can finalize it. How long should I be waiting for this? He is still yet to contact me. I don\u2019t want to drop out of GWU but I won\u2019t have a choice if this can\u2019t get done in time. Once housing opens up, if this isn\u2019t done by then singles may become unavailable.",

You just really need to register with them and put your accommodation letter from a clinician saying you need a single and they should process it pretty quickly. Also, if you put Mitchell on the top of your housing application if you don\u2019t get the accommodation in time you will probably get it.",

I think it was early June my year.",

I\u2019m just worried because I believe it takes minimum 1-2 to process *after* having this meeting.\n\nThough what you said about housing does provide some solace, thank you.",

    "postText": "I know this reddit may be a bit biased, but I need to decide between Syracuse and GW for college and need more info. Both are giving me fantastic aid. GW is closer to home and I do enjoy DC. It certainly has better weather than Syracuse. But I love the vibrant and community-centered vibe that Syracuse has. I plan on double-majoring in Psychology and Computer Science. I've already been admitted into a 5 year dual B.S. program at Syracuse but I know I can most definitely double major at GW.\n\nI know it comes down to a personal decision, but can anyone clarify some of the bigger gaps between the two and even just inject your own personal opinions? Do either have better programs I can take advantage of between internships, study abroad, and my intended majors?",

They are pretty even matched in most rankings.\n\nI can\u2019t really speak for Syracuse but I wouldn\u2019t chose GW purely based on the psych and comp sci programs. They\u2019re good but the programs are smaller and definitely not as important to the university culture as polisci, IA, public health, etc are. However, I wouldn\u2019t say that a 5-year double bachelor at Syracuse is necessarily advantageous. It would be a different story if it was a 3-2 or 4-1 bachelors/masters program, but staying another year for another bachelors degree (especially if you plan on going to grad school) just seems like a waste of money to me. I don\u2019t really think any employer would care or notice the difference between that and a double major somewhere else. \n\nAs for professional opportunity, DC hands down outmatches whatever Syracuse can offer, just because it\u2019s a much larger city with a huge internship culture. \n\nWhat I think really separates GW though is that it definitely doesn\u2019t have a strong campus feel, or a very vibrant community. It is a very independent culture and most students look to the city rather than the university for entertainment and activities. I had a cousin that went to Syracuse and she definitely had a completely different college experience than I did. \n\nIf a more traditional college experience is really important, don\u2019t go to GW. But otherwise, I would think that GW will provide more opportunities because of its location.",

            "comment": "Definitely think about what you\u2019re looking for location wise! DC has quick access to everything and has everything to offer as well as so many more opportunities. Syracuse is a small city surrounded by suburbs so there is a lot less to do. GW also has a \u201ccity campus\u201d where there basically in no campus, complete city feel whereas syracuse has a more closed off campus as well as off site buildings such as the Dome, the hospital, and the hill. \n\nGW also is a much smaller small, less focused on sports, greek life, and partying. Syracuse is largely focused on football and basketball games, tailgating, and sororities/fraternities. So if you want the typical college party scene I\u2019d say Syracuse as that\u2019s what it has to offer where as in DC the party scene is mainly bars and clubs. \n\nEducation wise it comes down to preference again as I e believe both schools are quite equal in what they\u2019ll offer. Definitely suggest visiting if you can that way you can get a feel, but go with what you think and don\u2019t be afraid of it not working out! You can transfer and it\u2019s not a bad thing.",

Agree with what others have said(small city,more traditional college experience) but what hasn\u2019t been said is that the winters there are BRUTAL. Snowfall starts around November and continues into Feb/March. 5-6 months of forced isolation is also not great.",

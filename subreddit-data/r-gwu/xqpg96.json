Even your chances of being caught is low, you will never know how trustworthy the company is\n- non fws is your best bet or you can actually apply for work authorization as an immigrant but you need actual reasons and you need to report them\n-go talk with the ISO ( if you really wanna work without the work authorization maybe dont tell them that but ask for an advice)",

Try restaurant/serving jobs or find some skills training to get yourself a skilled labor job. The former is probably the easier way to do it.",

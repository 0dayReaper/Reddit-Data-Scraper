    "postText": "Hi GW! Some in this community may know me from campus and for those who don\u2019t, my name is Rachel and I\u2019m the Greenhouse Manager in SEH. I also teach Biology of Horticulture :) \n\nWe have an upcoming plant sale from 9a-3p this Thursday and Friday (Dec 15 &amp; 16) in the Greenhouse. We have little evergreens and poinsettia, terrariums, and a huge range of houseplants, cactus, and succulents in many sizes. Prices are affordable - not DC plant store prices! All proceeds from the plant sale fund independent student research in the Greenhouse. We accept cash and credit (no gworld, no Amex or Discovery).\n\nIf you\u2019ve never visited the Greenhouse before, we\u2019d love for you to explore our space. You\u2019ll see the signs for the greenhouse on the 8th floor of SEH. Also if you have any plant questions, I\u2019m happy to answer them (here in the comments or in person). Raise high!",

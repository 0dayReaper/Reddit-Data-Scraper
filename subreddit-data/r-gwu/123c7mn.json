They have no actual department, rather it is a combination of professors from different departments. The curriculum apparently focuses mostly on black boxes which doesn't necessarily tell you how things work or why the results you get are important. This is one of the main reasons people end up switching into the statistics program. Granted, these problems are not unique to GW, most DS programs nationwide suffer the same issues of poor curriculum and organization.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I am a first year spring admit and will be joining GW in January! I have a couple questions for other people who also started in the spring semester rather than fall. \n\nWhat was the process like for room and board? Were you able to choose a roommate or was it assigned randomly? \n\nDid you feel like you missed out on anything? Was it easy to make friends? Did you have orientation, if so, what was that like? \n\nWere there any activities you weren\u2019t able to do that first semester? (Ex. I want to join choir but would I have to join next fall or can I join in the spring?)\n\nThank you \ud83d\udc99",

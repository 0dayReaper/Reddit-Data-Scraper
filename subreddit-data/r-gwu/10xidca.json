We\u2019re both undergraduate students at Cornell University looking to gain more hands on experience through internships and job opportunities.\n\nWith this being said, we are looking to sublet a 2 bedroom apartment from June-August. Our price range is $3000/month (each of us paying $1500). We are open to any suggestions, please reach out below or dm me!\n\n[Caroline and I at the Natural History Museum over this past Thanksgiving break :\\)](https://preview.redd.it/7xj6ousco2ha1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=07a7eb812e3a50ae8e81e3b00be16034de3b1912)",

It's mostly a supply-side issue, there just aren't a ton of actual 2 BD places super close to campus (pricing near-campus is also wild, I just talked to a friend who's paying 3k for a *one bedroom.* That's not unusual at GW)\n\nwhen my roommate and I were looking for places (we limited our search to within 5 blocks of the metro stop. If you're ok walking further, YMMV), we were only able to find 1 BD + den or weird converted 1 bedrooms (where cheap landlords put up a wall in the middle of the living room and call it a second bedroom).\n\nAssuming you *are* willing to go a little further, I'd check out the \"Washington DC Housing, Rooms, Apartments, Sublets\" group on FB (they're one of the biggest groups around, but there are a ton of similar resources). Especially if you're just coming for the summer, there are cheaper and more exciting places to live than Foggy. The GW metro stop (blue, orange, silver lines) is super convenient for a big chunk of internships and jobs, but depending on where you actually end up working, something on an entirely different line in a different part of the city might be better",

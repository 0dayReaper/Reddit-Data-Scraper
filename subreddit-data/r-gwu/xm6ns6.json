I lost quite a bit of money in penalties earlier, because of them going back on their word.\n\nAnd now more problem with the way they look at financial aid applications....\n\nAny suggestions pls?",

I've been like literally going back and forth with them. Like you, I thought they were working on it. Then realize indeed they were not. So I contact through email and they call, I'll follow up through email. It seems it's gotten me alot further. But it's everyday I'm talking to people.",

    "postText": "Hey! I need to move 10 large (21x18x18) boxes and one TV box (45x5x25) a really short distance (.4 miles) from I-House to the Fedex on K st. I have looked online and can't seem to find any reliable companies that are reasonably priced to help move the boxes. Does anyone know of any services or trusted people with a truck that would be willing to help? I was hoping to do this tomorrow morning (sometime between 9 am - 11:30 am). I will be compensating anyone available for their time. Thank you so much!",

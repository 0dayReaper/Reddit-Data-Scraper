If so, start now. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for something starting in august, you can probably afford to wait till April or may \n\nIn either case, I\u2019d highly recommend asking any off-campus friends to check out their apartments to see if any of them have places you like. You\u2019ll have much better luck getting a good place if you get in touch with a landlord before it goes on the market",

It's an amazing location and the cheapest studios I could find on campus area ($1440 when I signed). It was small and kinda gross but it was like half the price of Varsity which was worth it for me. Statesmen is next door and is a really good middle ground, they are slightly more expensive than Empire but a lot bigger, still not as fancy or exorbitantly expensive as Varsity though. If I had to go back I might opt for statesmen, but really anything within walking distance from GW is going to be mega expensive.",

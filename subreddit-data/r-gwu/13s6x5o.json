    "postText": "I plan on majoring in political science and criminal justice. I was wondering if anyone could let me know their thoughts about the public policy focus for political science. I know if need a few Econ courses as well as additional electives for the public policy focus. I\u2019m just wondering if the public policy focus is superior in terms of employment/grad school/ect. I ask because I have less Lee-way if I pursue a policy focus (I\u2019ll only have two electives, and everything else would need to be applied towards one of my majors or gpac).\n\nCareer wise I want to do urban planning (I don\u2019t know how important this is).\n\nIf anyone has insight, please LMK. \n\nThanks \ud83d\ude0a",

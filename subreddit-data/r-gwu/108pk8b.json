    "postText": "Hi everyone. I am a student working on a project with Community Partners, a nonprofit based in California, to compare how different campuses across the US are meeting the needs of their disabled and neurodivergent students. If you identify as such, please consider helping by answering a few questions. (This post was mod approved.)\n\nFeel free to reply within this thread or DM me your responses or questions.\n\n1. Are all campus buildings physically accessible to students who use wheelchairs or other mobility aids?\n2. Digital accessibility: Are class session recordings readily available for all large lecture courses?\n3. How much time do students have between consecutively scheduled classes?\n4. Are students required to provide documentation of disability to qualify for receiving **initial** accommodations?\n5. What is the wait time for an initial appointment with your campus' psychological counseling services?\n6. Is there required diversity and inclusivity training for faculty/staff/and students, **and** does training include recognition of neurodivergence and disability?\n7. Have you experienced ableism, discrimination, or seen/ heard any stigmatizing language on campus or on the college website?\n8. Does your college offer a Disability Studies curriculum?\n\nThank you for your time!",

            "comment": "I lived in a three story dorm without an elevator, definitely not accessible to those with wheelchairs or mobility difficulties. Class recordings were available for some classes not all. Most classes had 20 min between them. I was required to provide documentation for disability for accomodations. The wait time for initial appointment was less than a week but for ADHD services and assessment is was longer than 9 months. The services I was provided was not great and they ended up referring me out elsewhere because they weren't qualified to deal with my case. To my knowledge we don't have required diversity and inclusivity training including neurodivergence and disability. I have experienced some issues with ableism/DSS as when I submitted a proctor request for my final exam with plenty of time in advance for my accomodations, yet the professor never responded to me, DSS was never given my exam, they hosted the exam without me, and I was forced to take an incomplete. Additionally I have had some professors just not really understand PTSD and some of my mental illnesses which results in mistreatment. Unsure about disability studies curriculum.",

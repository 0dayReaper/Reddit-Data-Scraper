    "postText": "Nervous incoming freshman here. I know I have to register for orientation and all (which happens much later), but is there any way to get a general sense of what classes I will need for my first semester in the fall? I want to be totally prepared for registration and try to not end up with a bunch of 8am courses. If it helps, I plan on doing a B.S. in econ with a sustainability minor (and maybe one other minor depending on course overlap). A few questions I have:\n\n1. How difficult was it for you to get all the classes/timeslots you wanted for your freshman year?\n2. Is there somewhere I can view each course with its corresponding professor so I can get an early start on looking through rate my professor?\n3. Is registration first come first serve? Will it benefit me to sign up for the earliest possible registration date?\n4. In general, how can I start preparing now so I know exactly what I want/need when registration opens? Are there any steps I can take now in order to save me time in the future, closer to registration opening?\n5. Additionally, are there any steps I can take to just be more prepared in general when everything starts opening up (housing, registration, events etc.)? I've already claimed my GWID and I've been looking into my major and minor for course requirements, I also know I need to take the ALEKS placement exam but besides that if there's other stuff I'm missing please let me know!\n\nThank you in advance if you have any insight!!",

Make back ups back ups and back ups, then compile all the CRNs into a doc you can copy and paste from super fast. Look at the Gw bulletin to find out what classes you need to take, and look at the schedule of classes page to see available courses for the semester and the associated professors. I know other commenters have said to take major requirements first, but I\u2019d actually encourage you to do your GPAC general requirements first year, that way if you end up switching majors later on you don\u2019t have a lot of fall through classes (source: I was Elliott and did all my major classes freshman year, switching to criminal justice later on made me scramble to get all my requirements met before graduation). Just accept that it will be a brutal registration process (usually the website crashes when everyone logs on, screams through the hallways, etc) but that you\u2019ll end up with a semester of classes one way or another. And keep in mind if you don\u2019t get into a class at registration you can get on the waitlist or move in during the add drop period. You got this!",

I was able to knock out all my political science prerequisites (PSC 1001,1002,1003) in fall semester and get into higher level classes in the spring which have more topics I wanted to take. It might not be fun waking up at 7 but it definitely pays off in the long run (at least in my opinion)",

It\u2019s not that hard, people who get the shaft just like to complain about it online \n\n2. https://my.gwu.edu/mod/pws/subjects.cfm?campId=1&amp;termId=202303\n\n3. Sort of. Once you\u2019re an upperclassman, it\u2019s done by credits completed (does not count classes in progress). Not sure if it\u2019s changed for freshmen, but when I registered, they assigned everyone one of like 5 random times. Essentially, every time slot got 20% of the available spaces in freshman classes. So yes, first-come within your time slot, but if you get the last time slot, it\u2019s no different than the first time slot\n\n4. Go [here](https://economics.columbian.gwu.edu/bs-economics) to see what classes you need. Find the best professors for each class. Have all of the CRNs you need on a word-doc and just copy/paste them once registration opens \n\n5. Just keep an eye on your email, double check your spam every week, and you should be good \n\nAlso, just generally: try taking UW your freshman year. It\u2019s nice to never have to go back to the Vern after your first semester. I loved writing about romcoms with Dr. smith, not sure if she\u2019s still teaching it\n\nSuranovic is the best Econ 1011 prof (and one of the best just generally in the department). He\u2019s teaching the one that doesn\u2019t have an instructor listed right now. Take that one",

If you suck at science, you have two options: biological anthropology and environmental geology. If you take anything else, you risk a terrible teacher that will pollute your GPA with 4 credit Bs. As a CCAS student, you can take those non-major classes whenever, so wait rather than trying to knock them out if you aren't getting a teacher/class you know is good.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone! I just now finished my first year of college at Old dominion university and I got offered to attend George Washington University at a very discounted tuition rate. I\u2019ve read a lot about GWU online and tbh I really don\u2019t see myself as a fit there. One big thing is the social life, i\u2019m coming from odu so it\u2019s mostly frat parties/on campus house parties and clubs/bars aren\u2019t too common.  I\u2019ve heard about the opposite for GW, where it\u2019s mainly clubs/bars. I do like to drink occasionally and wouldn\u2019t mind going to clubs sometimes also, but my main interest would be house/dorm parties. Also would it be easy finding a group of stoner friends who enjoy smoking? One more thing, obviously GW is a few calibers above odu, I definitely haven\u2019t been the best student academically wise this first school year (throughout my whole life tbh) but I do want to step it up. Would it be really hard to fit in this environment with all the really smart students around me? I\u2019m quite literally the opposite of the type of students I\u2019ve heard attend there",

            "comment": "Finding people to smoke with is going to be super easy. There are frats/sororities that throw pretty frequent house parties, it\u2019s just a matter of finding friends and getting invited. I will say though that most people do go out to bars after house parties are over around 11. Also just find friends that don\u2019t like going out lol and drink at home with them. Depending on your major, you can definitely get by while giving moderate effort.",

What's your major? I think that will definitely affect the circles you run in and the types of people you'll encounter.",

    "postText": "Hi, long story short I\u2019m a sophomore on campus currently who is NOT going to live with my current roommate next year. She\u2019s dirty and treats me like her maid, and so I am looking for a new one for the next school year. \n\nI\u2019m going to be moving off campus and will be retrieving and training a PSD (psychiatric service dog) and so this female identifying person must be okay with dogs. I\u2019m a clean person (1x a week cleaning of whole place regularly) but by no means a neat freak. I\u2019m an exercise science major at Milken. I wanna stay close to campus, and need my own bedroom for myself and the future PSD. I like to read books, play video games, watch movies. I\u2019m totally okay with alcohol and other substances (I may even join you) but I CANNOT tolerate smoking/vaping of any susbstance due to my lung problems. \n\nIf you are looking or know anyone who is please reach out!! I know it\u2019s early but I want to find a good fit and begin looking at places starting next semester. I plan to move in right after the school year ends.",

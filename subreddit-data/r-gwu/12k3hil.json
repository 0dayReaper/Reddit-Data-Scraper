    "postText": "Trying to decide between San Diego State University, UMASS Amherst, and GWU. I've been accepted to the Columbia College of Arts but I am \"undecided\" in terms of major. My biggest concern about GWU is its lack of a campus. Is it difficult to meet people and build friendships b/c of the lack of campus?",

I think this was a very positive experience for me, but also an insanely expensive one that would be hard for me to recommend. \n\nSocial life at GW was very good, and I think it\u2019s largely what you make of it where ever you go.",

            "comment": "As someone from Southern California i can\u2019t really agree with what was said. I personally enjoy being in DC especially since it\u2019s the best places to be for my program. The access to internships in IA/poli sci is unmatched and you get that city vibe without being in a super busy city. I think you really need to decide what general field you\u2019re interested in and go from there. GW ranks much higher than SDSU or Amherst in terms of some majors, but if the vibe of the school really matters to you than GW\u2019s integration into DC can be a deal breaker",

The social scene here sucks. Can\u2019t speak for san diego because i don\u2019t know much about the school, but I know plenty of people who go to umass amherst and love it. It\u2019s also way fucking cheaper.",

But at least in the dorm I live in, no one is social and everyone keeps to themselves pretty much. Couldn\u2019t tell you my neighbors names and the only time i interact with my suitemate is when one us needs the bathroom. I\u2019m not a huge party person but my roommate is and she\u2019s basically stopped going because she says they\u2019re shitty. Can\u2019t speak for that though personally. Even with clubs, a lot of the time it can be hard to like, break into them if you aren\u2019t already a naturally super social person. I do have a handful of people I talk to and hang out with regularly so it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll be completely alone. Also this might not be a factor for you but I\u2019m pretty openly gay and that\u2019s definitely been a detriment, the homophobia i\u2019ve experienced here has been unpleasant to say the least.",

Also you don\u2019t have to drive everywhere!\n\nSDSU and UMass will give you more of a traditional college experience. GW is nice if you want to live in a city\u2014you forgo some aspects, but it\u2019s still nice\n\nCan\u2019t beat that SD weather tho",

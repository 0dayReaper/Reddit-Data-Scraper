I read their email and when discussing the term Colonials, they said, \u201cno matter how innocent the intention, is received as extremely offensive by not only students of the University, but the nation and world at large\u201d. I call BS. No one cares. I think all of us would much rather stick with the Colonials rather than blue fog, ambassadors, etc. Although, in my personal opinion I think \u201cRiver Horses\u201d would suit GW than Colonials, and all of the other newly proposed mascots. We\u2019re steps away from the Potomac, and everyone who has been on a GW tour has heard about the history of the hippo statue the president\u2019s wife lacked fondness of, which is why it\u2019s next to Lisener.  Anyways, we as students at GW should refuse to let the school who many of us give $80k a year, to change their mascot to one of the DUMBEST mascots in all of the over 4,000 colleges in the US, unless it\u2019s River Horses. F*** the athletic department for preventing River Horses from being on the ballot. We don\u2019t have ANY school spirit, so why should we give the them any leeway. I conclude my inebriated rant.",

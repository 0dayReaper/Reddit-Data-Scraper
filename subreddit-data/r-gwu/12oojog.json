West hall is probably the best hall freshman have access to since you would have a private bedroom and a common space as well as everything else west has access to: gym, dining hall (tho pelham isn\u2019t that good), black box theater, etc. only problem is it\u2019s on the vern which is honestly not that bad besides the vex being awful to deal with",

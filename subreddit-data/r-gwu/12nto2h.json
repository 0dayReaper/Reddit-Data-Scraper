I would say pay attention to the class selection and what you're interested in since GWU actually has a biomedical engineering program which might be slightly different than bioengineering. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn top of that look into the other stuff that will supplement your studies. I think what you're looking for will be vastly different depending on if you're planning on just going to med school or interested in researching fluid mechanics. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy gut reaction is that GMU seems to have slightly more pure biology and chemistry compared to GW which would have more electrical engineering coursework. Feel free to ask any more questions!",

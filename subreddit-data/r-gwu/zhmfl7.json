The presidential scholarship is usually given out like candy, and transfer enrollment has been plummeting recently so they might budge if you plead your case. \n\nIf money's no object, like I said, elliott blows UR out of the water. They're going to be killing us on the on-campus social life, but the opportunities in terms of the city, academics, and professional opportunities generally at Elliott are pretty unrivaled",

Both are absolutely insane and tbh aren\u2019t worth that sort of money at all tbh. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t say GW has a lot of academic resources for undergrads, though. Especially at Elliott, a lot of the research opportunities and funding go to grad students. There *are* opportunities for undergrads but it\u2019s incredibly competitive and was honestly a little disappointing for me. The professors and courses are typically great, and you get the benefit of the city\u2019s resources to use. There\u2019s always events going on too that are open to students, and a few times in my courses we\u2019d have special speakers who are in the field come in which was really cool. \n\nFor all your opinions I\u2019d probably go with GW and try to live off campus to save as much money as possible (plus GW housing is very mid). I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say by attending GW you\u2019re getting a better chance at a job in Int\u2019l Affairs, but it is definitely a cool experience which you can take a lot out of.",

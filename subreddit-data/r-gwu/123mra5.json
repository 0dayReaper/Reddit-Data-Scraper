    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI\u2019m an incoming grad student who will be studying SPS at the Elliott school. I am currently apartment hunting and could use some advice on what areas are safe/warrant the high prices. I am coming to DC from Detroit so I am already aware of the standard operating procedures when it comes to living in a big city.\n\nI am currently aiming for Arlington, or somewhere else in Northern VA; however, many people I\u2019ve spoken to are saying I\u2019d miss out not being in DC. \n\nAny advice would be great!\n\nThank you.",

I know plenty of people who have been happy there and it seems pretty safe. NOVA, foggy bottom, northwest DC and downtown DC are perfectly safe. Having lived in Oakland, chicago, and DC, I\u2019d say it has felt the safest.",

You can get the Capital Bikeshare pass from GW for $25 for the year, and you should be able to get the discounted metro card as well for $100 per semester.",

If you are ever out late (past midnight Monday -Thursday or past 1am Fri/Sat) in DC, let\u2019s say visiting a friend or at a bar/club, you\u2019ll have to take an Uber back to Virginia because the metro will be closed. The bus schedule is not 100% either and also closes at a certain time. I was willing to pay a little more to live close to school and not be limited by the metro hours.",

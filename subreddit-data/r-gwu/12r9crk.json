I hear from the top brass that this year was uncharacteristically competitive because of over-enrollment from post COVID last 2 years \u2013so students who normally would get in would be on the waitlist. There\u2019s so many factors tbh in admission (from class size, to demographic makeup, to administrative priorities, them thinking you won\u2019t attend anyways, etc) \u2013 you\u2019d be surprised how much luck is involved. So no matter what happens it\u2019s almost never a direct  reflection of you as a student (I learned the hard way). it\u2019s best to just do your best (as you are) and just keep chugging along no matter what. Good luck!",

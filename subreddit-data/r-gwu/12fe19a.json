I don\u2019t know much about Cook, but I\u2019ve generally heard decent things. \n\nMost of Sadtchenko's lectures are him just reading off the slides. He\u2019s not very accessible through email, but he\u2019s frequently available in his offices.  \n\nRazunguzwa gives guided notes with the lecture slides. Unlike Sadtchenko she takes attendance, and the since the notes are guided, missing classes have a bigger impact. She\u2019s very supportive if you do all the practice. I think she\u2019s better at explaining more complex topics and takes more time to do so, but for my class, she fell behind frequently. \n\n(Despite which professor you choose, utilize academic commons!)",

    "postText": "Hi y'all!\n\nI still want to live on campus next year, but I want to be in a dorm that's wayyyy less active than Thurston. As much as I appreciate the new building and the dining hall literally downstairs, the attitude thurstonites have towards other dorms, fire alarms, annoying behaviors ( messed up restrooms, fish incident, loud music at night/quiet hours... etc) , the need to be  unnecessarily social (AND SO MUCH MORE!!)is bothersome. I want a calmer housing experience next semester. Any suggestions?",

I had a massive dorm all to myself with a second bedroom I turned into a guest bedroom/yoga room, a living room area, another bedroom, a kitchen, a long ass personal hallway through the space, and a huge walk in closet I hung a hammock in and made a vibe room/library. I only got to stay there a few weeks before they booted everyone with the pandemic, but it was by far my best dorm experience at GW. The only thing that sucks is no elevator.",

I sent my regional counselor a LOCI with updates earlier already, so any tips on what I should include in this form? Should I just reiterate what I said in my LOCI and what documents could I send them? I know the chances of getting off the waitlist are slim but I want to at least try. Any advice is appreciated :)",

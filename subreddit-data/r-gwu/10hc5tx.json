            "comment": "it\u2019s not exclusive to international students, it\u2019s mandatory unless students opt out if they have through their parents. they might still be forced to take the SHIP plan because their own plan may be \u201cout of network\u201d - essentially, this means that their insurance doesn\u2019t have contracts with local healthcare providers. they also might not meet certain insurance requirements (i.e. copays, deductibles). i can\u2019t say whether most students take the plan since I opted out and it\u2019s not really something people talk about. if you have insurance that meets the requirements to opt out, you should probably do that. otherwise, you can\u2019t opt out and have to get coverage through SHIP.\n\ntl;dr healthcare and universities in the us are both overly complex and prone to emptying your wallet",

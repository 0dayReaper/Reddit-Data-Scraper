That said, Kung seems great, and I don't want to move to a class with a worse professor. Since Horst only has one review on ratemyprofessors, I don't know what to think. Any advice? Thank you",

He's very involved. My interactions have been with both as a graduate student (so not the classes they teach), but I think Alexander would be a good teacher, especially if it fits your schedule better. \n\nThat said, if you have any academic conferences or anything of the like, I'd get whichever of them you stick with up to speed as soon as possible. Schedule conflicts and deadlines seem to be where the physics depart falls apart a little bit, and it's never a bad idea to get that settled as early in the semester as possible.",

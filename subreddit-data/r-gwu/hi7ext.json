The cynic in me says yes, but I'm really not sure.\n\nAlso will be interesting to see GW's methodology for estimating their fossil fuel production all the way back in the 1800s.",

The \u201creal\u201d sunrise movement only exists because the left flank of the Democratic Party couldn\u2019t be bothered to sit down and listen to environmental activists, so they had to fabricate a fake environmental movement to create misleading graphics like the one that grades candidates on how much they tweet about climate change.\n\nOn a GW level, Sunrise is simply this year\u2019s trendy issue. They\u2019re well meaning, I\u2019m sure, but no matter what happened they would get bored and protest something else next year, just like they did with the pro-Palestinian protests in 2017-18 and with the anti-Colonials mascot protests in 2018-19. \n\nAlso at least the sunrise kids at those irrelevant Iowa colleges had the guts to harass major presidential candidates; ours live in the city where the climate change-denying Republican Party has all its major infrastructure, and they were... following tour guides around?",

    "postText": "So I applied early decision to GW and I\u2019ve been really anxious about hearing about my decision and especially anxious about denial. Since I had very poor grades because of the covid years and my gpa is a 3.03/4 because of those years, I\u2019m very worried that I will get denied. However, there are a lot of other things that work in my favor. Here are my stats:\n\n-3.03/4 GPA\n-submitted 1st quarter grades (3.71 gpa, all A\u2019s except for 1 C in IB physics)\n-IB diploma student\n-1390 SAT\n-Captain of the sailing team\n-officer for world affairs club, civic engagement club, young democrats and republicans club, Model UN crisis chair and officer, \n-Eagle Scout\n-awarded pennsylvania state civic engagement award\n\nWill these stats get me in and will they make up for my poor GPA? I also submitted the extra info section of the commonapp and let them know that my poor academic performance was due to covid combined with ADHD. Will I get in early-decision?",

It wouldn\u2019t be shocking if you got in but I would anticipate having to pay close to full price if you get in. Unfortunately you are just a number to these big schools, if you are going to bring their average down you\u2019d need to subsidize students with higher stats by paying more.",

It\u2019s an incredibly unjust and unfair system, but the business model that colleges created for themselves relies on students from high income families &amp; international students. You pay near full price so they can admit more qualified applicants and offer them large scholarships and financial aid. This is the same at essentially every  private school.",

I think it\u2019s more that if you get into a college it\u2019s probably based on your merits so you\u2019d probably get a merit scholarship and no need based financial aid. You wouldn\u2019t necessarily get the benefit of automatic admittance because of your families income but you\u2019re also not going to get a lot of need based aid. Resulting in probably being somewhere in the middle between someone paying full price and someone getting all their expenses covered by aid. IMO GW\u2019s finaid is pretty fair. People coming from middle class families leaving college with debt is not a \u201cbad thing\u201d. Allowing people from working class families to graduate without debt allows them to more effectively raise themselves out of their financial hardship and be able to amass wealth.",

I think what we have going for us is improvement since we started off bad it showed we took initiative and pulled ourselves together as opposed to someone who started off strong and had their grades drop recently. I relate to you in the sense that my GPA is close to yours and I also have a ton of EC's to make up for it I also feel really confident in my supplemental and personal statement. Im just a little scared that they wont accept me because I am applying for financial aid, but Im sure we'll both go where we're meant to be. Goodluck!",

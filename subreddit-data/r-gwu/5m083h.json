    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n  I've just started as the new Chair of the Computer Science Department, so I thought I drop by here to say hello.\n\nAlso, [Lifehacker just posted a story today](http://lifehacker.com/traffikcam-fights-human-trafficking-with-an-app-you-can-1790564650) about an app I've helped develop.  This app seeks to help fight sex trafficking by crowd-sourcing the creation of a database of hotel rooms, and creating an image matching search tool so that law enforcement can use that database to determine where victims were if they have pictures of them.  If you are traveling, i'd love you to take pictures of the hotels where you are staying --- our app has had 100000 downloads and we have more than 1.6 M images in the database, but every new image helps!\n\nIf you are interested, here is [a paper highlighting some technical details](http://research.engineering.wustl.edu/~pless/pdfs/AIPRSexTraffickingFinal.pdf).\n\nI'm very excited to join the GW community!\n\nRobert Pless",

I was going to talk to Dr. Youssef about some procedural things since my interim advisor (not Dr. Diab) wasn't too sure about what I was asking. Can I send you an email or a message on here to possibly set up a meeting or Skype session or whatever to discuss my question(s)?   \n\nNice to have you around. I hope to get to know you.",

As there are no tours available, I am asking any current freshman who may have 15 or 20 minutes to show my son a freshman dorm room  and maybe answer a few questions. On the tours given, he only saw the hallway, never a dorm room. Thank you in advance.",

It\u2019s gonna be tough to get someone for several reasons. The first is that we are just about to hit finals week so we are all fairly busy studying, the second is that we don\u2019t know you so your request equates to inviting a stranger into our dorms (which most people don\u2019t like to do). That being said I wish you the best of luck finding someone!",

Maybe go to the student center and ask if you can see a display room.\n\nA couple of things! First of all I\u2019m instate and a ton of kids from my high school go there which wasn\u2019t the most appealing thing in the world. \n\nBut GW obviously has a lot of positives to go for it. Obviously there\u2019s the city campus and the really cool architecture, but the big one for me had to do with my major, CS. The program at GW seemed amazing, the professors I met were really passionate and seemed to offer a lot of advice and good things to say about GW\u2019s real world experience/research/internship scene. SEAS (or GW Engineering now as of two weeks ago) has an amazing facility and smaller class size as well.\n\nThere were also social aspects as well. For one, the club sports scene at GW seems great, basketball games look like a ton of fun, and the professional orgs/clubs seem really well put together.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit more expensive than Bing(and that point killed me for a while), but the potential workforce opportunities it provided align with everything else I listed just made it worth the extra cost over Bing to me. Plus I\u2019m pretty confident with a few internships or summer gigs I\u2019ll be able to pay for the difference and not take all too many loans out, if at all.",

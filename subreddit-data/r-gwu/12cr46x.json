Decided to go to GW however, mainly because of internship opportunities. I don't take academics that seriously now that I'm in college, so maybe Loyola would have been a better choice for social life. If I was you, especially with that major, I would go GW. Worst case you hate it and transfer, but most likely you'll find great career opportunities that you would never find in Chicago. If you're worried about social life, I genuinely suggest looking into greek life. I lived on the vern freshman year and I think I might have dropped out if I didn't rush. If you hate greek life then just get into the clubbing/rave scene and you'll have more than enough to do.",

I don\u2019t know def seems like the better choice w how IA oriented the school is. Plus from what ive seen they treat the business majors way better than us stem majors \ud83e\udd72",

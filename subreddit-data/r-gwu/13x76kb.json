I have a referral note from my doctor diagnosing me with anxiety and referring me to a therapist but the document doesn\u2019t state anything about me needing a housing accommodation. Do you guys think it will be enough to just send in the referral?",

            "comment": "I am in the process of getting housing accommodations and I am just letting know you you have to put in the referral rn if you want to get it. They told me it takes 3-4 weeks for housing (after an initial interview about why you need your accommodations which took 2ish weeks to set up) to get back with their decision and they just sent me an email my academic accommodations are accepted (I have extra time on tests) and my housing accommodations should be accepted or denied sometime next week. Therefore you\u2019re kind of running out of time if you actually want the accommodations. \n\nAs for the referral, I don\u2019t know if that would be enough. For some more context, I have a condition called CSID which greatly limits my diet to a keto, gluten free, low sugar, low starch and I have to take medicine called sucraid up to six times throughout the day along with a few other medications. \n\nFor me and my housing accommodations I need to live on Foggy Bottom because of the access to UPS (Sucraid is not covered my insurance and is shipped every 2-3 months and CVS does not hold it) and a Whole Foods because that is where the majority of my food comes from per my strict diet. Foggy Bottom has these things Mount Vernon does not. I also need a separate fridge for my roommate and me because Sucraid takes up about half a micro fridge and that would not be fair to my roommate if she had only a 1/4 rather than 1/2 a space to put her food. \n\nWhen sending this in, we had my three to four letters all from different doctors explaining why I should live on Foggy Bottom and need an extra fridge. As for my academic accommodations I had them through college board and they essentially transferred over. \n\nI am not saying anxiety is not a real thing (as I have it too and that\u2019s part of the reason I have extra time) but to get these accommodations you need to really go in depth in explaining why and how we need them. Make sure to read over your doctors note and make sure they do that. I know all of my doctors notes were two to three pages long all. In your instance have your general doctor, psychiatrist, and your therapist all write notes.\n\nHowever please keep in mind housing assignments are coming out sooner rather than later and you should probably contact DSS now rather than waiting. \n\nI hope this helps!",

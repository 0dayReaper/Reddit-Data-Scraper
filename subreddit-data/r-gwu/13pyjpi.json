    "postText": " Major: International Relations\n\nPossible minor/major in: CS and/or Poli. Sci.\n\nI am looking for a roommate who:\n\n1. Doesn't mind me waking up at 5AM to go running around the monuments (even better if they run with me)\n2. Doesn't make noise beyond 10PM\n3. Is actually a clean person\n4. Doesn't invite ppl over when I am studying (however, I'll be fine if they can invite ppl over and if I have a place to study, thats cool)\n5. Can use my stuff but only to a certain extent (aint no one using my slippers for the shower)\n6. Who I can actually talk with, although the stuff i mention above is mildy strict I am a human being\n7. Extra Credit: someone who does martial arts, will participate in the martial arts clubs, someone who is intrested in geopolitics and will participate in geopolitical clubs/orgs, and they play paradox games (ideally EU4) \n\n Pros of being a roommate with me:\n\n1. \\-I am not a noisy person, I like peace\n2. I'll clean our room if it means keeping it clean (would be nice if I get some help though)\n3. I'll cook meals not only for myself but also for my roommate (I won't be cooking any unhealthy shit though like ramen, I refuse to fuel my body with saturated fats, high amounts of sodium, added sugars, etc)\n4. I can run with you in the mornings around the monuments\n5. \\-I speak English and Spanish fluently\n6. I'll help you with any assignments you don't understand (hopefully you can do the same for me)\n7. I play the hell out of paradox games\n\n Cons of being a roommate with me:\n\n1. I am more or less an introvert, I have a social battery and sooner or later I'll run out of steam\n2. I intend on bringing my PC and my gaming laptop. My gaming laptop has loud fans (which I won't really be using since I got my pc) and my keyboard has red keys (mildly noisey)\n3. I don't want people over if I am busy with something and I have no where else to be but in the dorm (I can always leave to study somewhere else though)\n4. My sleep schedule is mostly sleeping around 9pm and waking up at 5am, we could have conflicting sleep schedules\n5. I am male and I want a male roommate",

So finding a place to study if your roommate has someone over shouldn't be an issue.\n\nI found my roommate on the Class of 2025 Instagram page and it worked out fine. That's probably your best bet.",

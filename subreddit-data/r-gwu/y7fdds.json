    "postText": "Hi! I'm looking for a female roommate for an apartment off-campus for the upcoming spring semester because I'll be starting my MA in Forensic Psychology. I have a couple places in mind in Alexandria and Arlington, but I haven't made a decision yet. I'm planning to move in around January 1st. Please private message me if you're interested!",

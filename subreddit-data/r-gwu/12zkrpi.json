There\u2019s lots of good happy hours but the real night life happens in DuPont and Adam\u2019s Morgan (one of the best neighborhoods in the country imo). 14th street also has a nice collection of bars and clubs but has more of a transplant vibe. Still 14th and AdMo have a great street feel where people are spilling out into the streets. There\u2019s also a collection of bars/clubs in the downtown/Penn Quarter area where NOTHING happens at night except in those bars. Opera, Sax and Hill Country are here. Pick your poison.",

My friends and I also usually don\u2019t hang out around campus much on weekends. \n\nSaturday, most people sleep off their Friday hangovers and then may/may not go out across the city for a boozy brunch \n\nSunday is usually reserved for sleeping off a two day bender, grocery shopping, and doing homework",

            "comment": "From my experience, all of my housing and tuition were covered. Most of it was grants, and the remainder were loans. Some people were lucky and it was all grants and scholarships. If the loans are more than the cost of tuition and housing, you can return the remaining amount. The other option is to get a refund from the excess funds (i.e. loans) and use it to offset the cost of expenses such as groceries, dorm supplies, a laptop (if you need a new one), and textbooks. It is still a loan so you will need to pay back the full amount when you graduate. I also got more money for FWS. So basically I didn't have to pay anything. \n\nI will say I had friends that also were on a full-ride scholarship that got additional funds to cover purchasing textbooks, a laptop, and basic dorm supplies. It depends on your personal situation and application. If anything it might be a few hundred dollars or maybe 1k-2k that you will have pay for the semester/year\n\nHoping you get a good package!",

            "comment": "From my experience with an EFC 0, I still had to pay around $15k -20k a year after all the grants and scholarships. I got offered loans too but didn\u2019t take them, otherwise I would\u2019ve paid zero but I would\u2019ve been in debt. The people who got full rides and took out no loans had an outside scholarship that covered the rest. GWU rarely offers full rides, even for people with EFC 0.",

Would you be willing to share just how much you got in GWU grants and scholarships? I won't get my financial aid package until closer to decision day and I would really like to go to GWU, but if it's too expensive, I won't be able to.",

The cost varied depending on the dorm you lived in, some dorms were more expensive that others. I can\u2019t remember the exact amount, but you can pretty much do the math, so the cost of attendance was 75K a year when I started my freshman year (2018) but i think it\u2019s gone up since. So, 75K-15K=60K worth of scholarships and grants. It was a good amount. I would strongly encourage you to look for local scholarships in your community to cover the rest.",

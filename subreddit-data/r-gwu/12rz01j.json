I currently have a full time job and totally not interested in spending 7-10 hours per week for a class. What do you guys recommend for a less demanding elective class? \n\nI am EMSE student but I wouldn\u2019t mind taking an elective outside of that if it is fun and easy.",

Theres usually a lot of options and they\u2019re listed as IAFF 6502 or 6503.",

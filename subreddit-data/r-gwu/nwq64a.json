Do you have a problem with the way they present the condition of the dorms? Or availability of classes on the Vern? Or just that they\u2019re operating under the assumption that it\u2019s general knowledge that there is traffic in an urban area like DC? In my experience professors are pretty understanding when the vex is late. \n\n\nIt sounds to me like you\u2019re misunderstanding the post. I read it as frustration over the same questions asked and answered ad nauseam. I don\u2019t think anyone has problems with people asking questions, I don\u2019t ever see them downvoted into oblivion, mostly just the number of people posting without browsing the sub first. I haven\u2019t seen anyone trying to paint the Vern any particular way apart from people complaining and others trying to offer their positive experiences.\n\n\nI genuinely don\u2019t think anyone has problems with people complaining about the Vern, but complaining about transparency without being able to produce any concrete examples apart from vex traffic problems doesn\u2019t contribute a lot to the conversation. \n\n\nFrom your post history it looks like you\u2019ve got a pretty cynical and negative viewpoint on most things.

They're not going to tell you the *potential* negative things or things they don't have experience with. \n\nFor example, If I know ahead time I can't be in every org I want, I might start prioritizing and checking meeting times before coming to campus.

But since you\u2019re on a time crunch for Monday, I would either a) try and register for both and see if it lets you or b) if the system straight up doesn\u2019t let you, register for just one and then some other random elective, and then use an RTF to get into the other elective (note this will only work if the system doesn\u2019t let you register for both, but advising says the credits will count)",

This is allowed in other majors like IA and PSYC for special topics classes. I would email the Econ advising at econadvising@gwu.edu with the question and they usually get back pretty quickly. Also, you can schedule a meeting with Prof Tien (the Econ advisor) but she has very limited office hours. Here\u2019s the Econ dept website with more contact info:\n\nhttps://economics.columbian.gwu.edu/undergraduate-student-resources",

            "comment": "President Wrighton definitely needs to be more careful with these types of issues in the future and it's really not a good look to have to make this kind of statement so early in his tenure. \n\nBut overall this seems like a solid response. I do hope he personally reached out to the artist to apologize as well.\n\nEdit: The statement \"I support freedom of speech\u2014even when it offends people\" is questionable to say the least. I understand the sentiment... but it needs to be worded differently. Otherwise the response is solid.",

                    "comment": "&gt;  The statement \"I support freedom of speech\u2014even when it offends people\" is questionable to say the least.\n\nThe strategy of the CSSA/United Front Work Department is to claim that any speech criticizing the CCP is outside the scope of free speech, purely because it is offensive to them. So I don't really see what's wrong with that statement. He's simply rejecting that world view. \n\nKeep in mind, regardless of the University Investigation, if there were any Chinese students involved in the placement of those \"offensive\" posters, they will be reported back to the Chinese consulate and will surely face punishment. Previously a University of Minnesota student got 6 months in Chinese prison for memes mocking Xi Jinping while abroad- https://wenshu.court.gov.cn/website/wenshu/181010CARHS5BS3C/index.html?https://wenshu.court.gov.cn/website/wenshu/181107ANFZ0BXSK4/index.html?docId=27a654e725c040df9423ab2800a16a11\n\nThe lack of protections and societal value on free (and sometimes offensive) speech is what allows this to happen",

Like u/Legodude293 pointed out, people will hopefully understand that caveat as implied, but given the recent incidents it doesn't hurt to clarify it. Ultimately I'm just nitpicking.\n\nI do support President Wrighton's overall sentiment which is that just because somebody's expression of free speech offends somebody else does not mean it should be censored.",

            "comment": "While this is a welcomed correction all of this has caused me to look into some of the stuff he did when he was chancellor of Wash U. According to this article he brought the university into the \u201cUniversity Alliance of the Silk Road\u201d which is a part of China\u2019s belt and road initiative. The founder of that initiative endorsed Xi Jinping thought pretty heavily so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s apolitical. \n\nhttps://danforthdispatch.com/global-ties-questionable-allies/amp/\n\nThat coupled with how quickly he decided to respond to these student group complaints without knowing the facts make me feel pretty uneasy about where he stands on China. I took Mandarin Classes for 3 years in high school through a program sponsored by the Confucius Institute. My teachers were from mainland China and while they where great people it seemed the courses where definitely designed to paint a positive political image of China. The Confucius Institute at GWU was closed after this kinda stuff came to light about it. \n\nI understand people have concerns about bringing up  this stuff as it could lead to unwarranted criticism of  Chinese students on campus, but I think we also as a school need to do more to call out what is going on in China. Wrigthon\u2019s respond called the posters a \u201ccritique of China\u2019s policies\u201d. They weren\u2019t a critique of policy they where a critique of an ongoing genocide, one the US government has officially recognized as one.",

I just said the \u201ccures\u201d are similar in the sense that they aren\u2019t cures at all. If you look at your article that you sent, it says that the booster is 81% effective in reducing Covid-deaths. So can we at least agree that yes the vaccine is a godsend and it\u2019s helped us so much, but it\u2019s not 100% effective? That\u2019s really my main point here and I feel like you would agree. There\u2019s no point in arguing about this any longer because what\u2019s done is done? \n\nThe only reason why I\u2019ve kept on replying to you is that you come off as extremely insensitive to others\u2019 feelings about covid. Of course people are going to be scared. It\u2019s a human emotion and this is something that\u2019s unprecedented. We\u2019re scared to see our loved ones possibly die.

And I was one of the lucky ones, I had a family I could go to for support. Facts show the emotion isn\u2019t warranted if your vaxxed.

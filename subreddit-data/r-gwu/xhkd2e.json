[20% of the US News ranking goes to something called a \u201cpeer survey\u201d](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/ranking-criteria-and-weights), while things like percentage of faculty that is full time is 1%, and so is student-faculty ratio (which I *personally* think matter more). The criteria doesn\u2019t even include things like research output, diversity, average salary after graduation, etc. These are private companies creating rankings to pull ad revenue and unfortunately people decide which schools they apply for / attend based off of these rankings. This doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t ways for GW to improve, but I don\u2019t think improving in order to raise the spot in the rankings will actually improve the quality of the university and the student experience.",

            "comment": "The fact that there\u2019s a 7-way tie for 55th (immediately above us) and then a 4-way tie for 51st (and then ties pretty much straight through to 35th) doesn\u2019t help us. Small increases in our scores could pretty easily result in big jumps in our ranking \n\nAs a general point, many of the areas GW excels in aren\u2019t particularly valued by the USNews methodology (internships, our strength in IA/polisci [due to lower starting salaries], internships again because Jesus Christ we have so many opportunities, part time faculty here being a major PLUS rather than the problem it is in many places, among others) \n\nJust going through the USNews methodology and looking at their big points: \n\n*6 year graduation rate and freshman retention*: GW is expensive and many people ultimately aren\u2019t able to justify the cost of staying. I doubt that I would have stayed had COVID not brought my COA down massively during the pandemic. There\u2019s also what feels like a big contingent of people who are still sad about not getting into Georgetown and try to transfer (at least in elliott) \n\nPeer assessment: GW\u2019s always going to be second fiddle to Georgetown, and I would guess that much of what USNews undervalues is also undervalued by peer schools and faculty \n\nFaculty resources: I don\u2019t really care how big my classes are or if my profs have PhDs. I just want smart and accomplished people. When you\u2019re in DC right next to State and the heart of government, that means a lot of part time faculty. I think that\u2019s great, USNews probably doesn\u2019t \n\nSelectivity: this is what LeBlanc was trying to push (smaller class sizes and a focus on STEM, which would likely increase SAT score ranges and starting salaries, more on this below). I don\u2019t mind cutting class sizes by 20%, it\u2019s just a question of whether GW can afford to do so \n\nFinancial resources: not really sure how this works or what good resources look like. I\u2019ll just say that more doesn\u2019t necessarily equal better when dipshit bureaucrats get to decide where the money\u2019s going \n\nAlumni giving and debt: lumping these together because we don\u2019t really do well here. We\u2019ve got no school spirit, high tuition, limited financial aid, and our best programs are in fields with lower starting salaries\n\n*but this is just like, my opinion man. I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m talking about",

Most will donate directly to the programs that they themselves have been a part of as compared to the university as a whole. I personally wouldn\u2019t donate to GW as a whole but would rather donate directly to say the GW Institute for Korean studies or the Sigur Center for example because I have built a relationship with the professors in the department and support their missions. GW admin as a whole is so bad I don\u2019t want to give them a penny. The departments and various organizations that are under the university do deserve donations however",

If one has a choice between UMD and GWU for CS, go GWU.  The top ranking of UMD doesn't matter professionally, and the caliber is equal to that of UMD.  In fact some of our courses are more challenging and rewarding than those of UMD--don't worry, the grades get inflated in difficult classes, and GPA doesn't matter after you achieve continuous employment.",

It's the right move long-term to be more well-rounded and not just poli sci etc, but in the short term it hurt selectivity and also got even more expensive than it already was. Gw is an excellent school but insanely overpriced. Until that image changes, GW will be viewed as an excellent school that's just too expensive and its strengths in liberal arts don't compensate for a STEM program people don't seem to view as particularly noteworthy and not worth the crazy tuition. GW realistically is viewed as an excellent school but for rich kids from NY/NJ who want to be politicians/lawyers/diplomats. It's a stereotype but it's very accurate. I don't see GW lowering tuition, so only way to rank better is to improve the STEM programs to attract more applicants, get more alumni, and use the increased resources to become more selective and rank better.",

It was nice, but as someone who wanted to study International Affairs, my options were pretty much GW and American. I didn\u2019t have the grades to get into Georgetown and I wanted the DC experience. I chose GW over American because I liked the campus better.",

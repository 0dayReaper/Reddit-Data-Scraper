    "postText": "Hello all!\n\nI\u2019m currently pursuing my MS and I will be done around early November. I\u2019m looking into the online PhD in Systems Engineering program offered at GWU and was hoping to get some reviews on their online programs in general. \n\nI\u2019m not particularly worried about getting into research or academia, I just enjoy furthering my education and would quite frankly love the Dr. title. \n\nI understand the brick-and-mortar institution is actually decently prestigious, would their online programs follow suit?\n\nThanks!",

If we had been furloughed, I would have been happy to consider coming back, and to understand the hard spot the university is in. This was just a slap in the face, and I think I have to just move on. I can't count the number of back to back 18 hour shifts I had to work with 3 hours 'sleep' in between, or entire holidays that I've missed to be at work. Way too much sacrifice to let this one go. I also agree that it's very frustrating that the university hasn't publicly made a statement about all these layoffs, trying to make it seem like they're not happening. The handful of jobs that they're reposting to let us grovel for would mean taking a big paycut and still not having an actual start date until winter at earliest.",

The university is consolidating all of the facilities positions and departments(some schools had their own separate department). There will be 21 positions for everyone to apply for, and then everything else will be handled by contractors. This includes facilities, health and safety, and gworld (if not more)being brought under one roof. I was told that the entire HVAC team were given their notice yesterday. They are trying to balance the budget by laying off(with severance packages) people who have middle class and lower incomes. Meanwhile I know of multiple 90+ yr old faculty with severe mental decline making $450,000 a year, that no longer have labs, grants, or research projects, and who don\u2019t teach any classes. Don\u2019t even get me started on the redundancy of upper administration and the amount they are paying NEWLY HIRED administrators(a Dean position that was created a few weeks ago). The administration will protect the income of their friends at the top, over the livelihood of their essential employees.",

I don't have any expertise in university finance and I'm sure it's incredibly complicated, but you would think that GW also has more resources to work with than a smaller school though. I can't imagine how much revenue the endowment grows for GW every year, and there are also huge real estate assets and a massive line of credit. It would be really interesting to know more about how the money behind all this works, and what goes into the projected loss figures. I'm not trying to be too critical of the university, I'm just genuinely curious about that.",

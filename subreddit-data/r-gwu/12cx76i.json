            "comment": "Varsity has housed a lot of my friends but has awful management. They have beautiful amenities but with a one bedroom starting at 2500 for 500 square feet, it's just not worth it. I lived in Empire on 20th and F and it was the cheapest available at the time, 1400 for a studio, but it was small, dark, and kinda gross. Nothing egregious, but if you have a higher budget I would def invest in something a little nicer. Basically all housing options in foggy will be priced way high, so just be prepared for the sticker shock. I did my last semester commuting onto campus from Logan Circle/14th street area and we got a lot more for our money, and it was fun to break out of the foggy bubble. If you are able to get a bit off campus that will open your options a lot, but if you're tied to campus I would suggest looking for roommates/housemates to give you more options.",

            "comment": "Personal specific experience: Claridge is a great building. The north building is nicer. The south building is cheaper. The units are all owned by individual landlords (which means no shitty corporate management company, but individuals can be more hit or miss) \n\nIn terms of the townhouse vs apartment decision, that comes down to whether you want better amenities or a bigger space. The buildings nearby have a concierge, deal with trash, typically have a gym and either a pool or nice roof. \n\nTownhouses nearby are going to probably have more sqft/person. They might also be cheaper\n\nObviously, the further you live from campus, the cheaper your place will be. My girlfriend and I are in an amazing corner apartment in Claridge. It\u2019s huge and has a great view, but even with a Covid rate of $2300/month, it\u2019s pretty pricy for a 1BD compared to other areas of DC. With that said, I know people paying +$3,000 for 1BDs, so maybe it\u2019s not all that bad",

I used to live there and even though it was a one bedroom apartment we had 1200 square feet. \nOther than that, check out some of the townhouse conversions near campus. Gonna be a little dingy but can be affordable",

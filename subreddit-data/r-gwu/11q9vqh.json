    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nSince GW advisors really haven't been helpful I decided to turn to the wise souls of Reddit. I am currently a first-year in CCAS, but I have credits to start as a junior next year (currently a sophomore). I'm thinking about double decreeing versus double majoring since I have extra time, while also graduating early- so 2 bachelor's in 3 years. however in order to pull this off on this timeline, I'd need to take summer courses for both summers, which I'm fine with but its the cost that's making me hesitant. I do plan on going to law school, so I'm curious is if the extra work and cost of double-degree-ing but taking summer classes too is worth possibly being a better candidate for Law School (considering I will keep my GPA up).\n\nIf anybody has any advice on a similar experience, is it worth it to a double degree? I love both of my majors and I figured having a full degree in both topics may help me in the job field before Law School and help me apply as well. Please let me know! Summer class registration begin on Wednesday and I am lost.",

Professor Jill Kasle, a GWU law professor, offers two courses that are based on law school and could be very informative for you. You could also spend this time at an internship or getting an article published in an undergrad law review, either at GWU (who will work with you to write one) or another school (who you will just submit a completed article to)",

Do whatever you need to maximize your GPA and save as much money as possible\n\nI had a friend come in freshman year with 60 dual enrollment credits. His original plan was to stay for four years and double major + double minor\n\nBecause he's smarter than his family is rich, he realized that that would be a stupid plan and decided to graduate in two years. He graduated during COVID and (as far as we're both aware) went on to be the youngest hill staffer in the last few years\n\n&gt; I figured having a full degree in both topics may help me in the job field before Law School and help me apply as well\n\nAgain, law schools will not care. Employers will also not care about the distinction between double major vs dual degree",

They only care about your actual law school grades and work experience. Every interview I had asked me about work experience. I say you should focus on your GPA during the school year and get a legal internship over the summer. \n\nI'm a 2L at a school ranked in the 50s-60s and the thing that impressed my current employer (mid-biglaw firm in a major east coast market) the most was that I worked for a law firm each summer in undergrad. Since people who go straight to law school don't really have work experience, summer internships are really helpful. Keep a high GPA, study hard for the LSAT, and have some good internship experience. \n\nI was a legal intern at a small boutique firm in Dupont all four years (both during the summer and a little during the school year). Unbelievably helpful experience. I learned so much and the lawyers there gave me a ton of advice going into law school! I also got a great letter of recommendation from my boss which I submitted with my law school apps. Those things count.\n\nAnd again...GPA and LSAT. The legal field is archaic as hell. Some schools are pushing away from that a bit, but its a very slow changing field. Grades are huge.",

Double major is very impressive and don't worry if you can't maintain a 3.6+.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, once you're in Law School or a working professional, no one gives a rat ass about GPA.  But a double major will last longer, and make you a more well rounded professional compared to the one dimensional pre-professionals with okay LSATs and immaculate grades.\n\nDon't worry about debt; in 10 years time that debt will be worth less if you can maintain paying the monthly premiums.",

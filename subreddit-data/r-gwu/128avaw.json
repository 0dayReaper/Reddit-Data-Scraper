Avoid massive buildings because the fees for utilities &amp; \"services\" can creep up fast. You get $100/semester all-you-can bus/metro card, and $25 for a year pass for capital bike share. This means you can pretty much live anywhere and have a reasonable time getting to campus.",

It\u2019s not the sexiest area to live because there\u2019s not a lot to do (no bar scene) but it\u2019s 4 stops to Dupont plus 15 minute walk (because I didn\u2019t want to change Metro lines downtown). Door-to-door was an easy 30 minutes.",

It\u2019s super easy to get to school and my 1bed 1 bath apt is only like 1800, which normally would be out of budget for me but I work as a leasing consultant for my building and part of my benefits package is a 20% reduction on my rent for being a resident (brings it down to about 1400/month)",

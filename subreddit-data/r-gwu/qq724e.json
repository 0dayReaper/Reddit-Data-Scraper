It's not right to push another $100 fee to students if they will not benefit at all from it. \n\n&gt;This will also encourage people to get out of the Foggy Bubble and engage what DC has to offer\n\nThe metro isn't *that* great for getting around if you already live in Foggy. I say that as someone who uses it fairly often. It shouldn't be on students to subsidize other students to go \"explore\".",

The SA has finally made progress and gotten the cost down to this low price after years of discussion. Doing this not only benefits you but the entire study body. Financial aid even covers the cost so this works for all parties.",

But that's besides the point,  these things are happening in the nation's capitol... THE most overpoliced city in the country, there are cops with far more access to deadly force all over this campus and that isn't stopping these things so what makes you think adding a small section of an already minuscule campus police force is all of the sudden going to change things?",

Arming GWPD will not turn them into super heroes that arrive the second you call. However, if you use even the tiniest amount of critical thinking you might be able to understand that for criminals, the risk involved when committing a crime would greatly increase. Thinking logically here, the chances of someone committing a crime are exponentially higher when there is no danger for them involved, whereas if the risk of death/injury is a possibility, a criminal would think twice before committing the act. Most importantly, in this society (sadly) criminals commonly have the upper hand (i.e Firearms of their own) over civilians. How do you expect GWPD or any law enforcement officer to do their job of **Enforcing the law** and protecting others in a situation where it\u2019s needed if they didn\u2019t have a means of protecting themselves and others. Not sure why you tried to bring up such specific percentages without really mentioning where you got them from. I understand you have your own, very strong, opinions about law enforcement (and I can understand that) but I suggest you learn to put opinions aside for the sake of rational thinking.",

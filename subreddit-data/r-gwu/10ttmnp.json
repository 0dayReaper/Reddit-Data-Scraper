I had to ask a couple of professors( some won\u2019t even reply back) I ended up taking another class with a professor who knows me well and that I can catch up with missing lessons. In terms of independent study, my advisors told me some professor like to know about it ahead of it. I am doing research as well, and it\u2019s hard to find a faculty advisor if u don\u2019t have a good relations with them.",

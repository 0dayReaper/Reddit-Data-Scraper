Technically, you don't *have* to take the first-year CS courses, but it might be worth investigating if it will help you stay on time with your degree. As you prepare to matriculate, take a look at the [bulletin](http://bulletin.gwu.edu/) to see the required CS first-year courses\u2013if there's an overlap with your current major's classes, great! Otherwise, you'll have to make some decisions to ensure you're not taking too many courses or overwhelming yourself needlessly. Worst case, you can prioritize taking your gen-ed requirements. Again, talk to your advisor and they'll help you formulate a plan suitable for your personal situation.\n\nThe requirements for internal transfer to SEAS are listed at the [bottom of this page](https://registrar.gwu.edu/undergraduate-internal-transfer)",

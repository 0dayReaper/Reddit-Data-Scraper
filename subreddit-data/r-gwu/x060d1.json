    "postText": "Hi guys, \n\nAs some of you may know, GW has a long, and some would say fierce, tradition called Slap Ass Fridays. Basically, you would try to slap as many butts as possible without getting yours slapped. Obviously, there is a concern about sexual harassment among those not participating and this is why we did away with the tradition but I think we could solve this by banning sexual harassment on campus, a move I personally think is long overdue.   \n\nShould we bring it back? I think so!",

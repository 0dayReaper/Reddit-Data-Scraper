    "postText": "Title pretty much says it all  \n\n\ni heard that with ED at gw, you get a cap on merit and bad financial aid packages (note: i dont really know how all this works yet im a junior in hs). I also heard that you can appeal after you get accepted   \n\n\nI want to go to GW but as a student who needs scholarship money and financial aid, I dont know what to do. I also dont know if i can get in with a RD, as my stats (below) look good, I've seen people get rejected on different subs with better stats than me  \n\n\nmy stats are 4.1 gpa, IB candidate, no sat/act yet  \n\n\nThanks",

Like if I wasn\u2019t pursuing graduate education and hadn\u2019t gotten scholarships I\u2019d never pay back loans expensive.

            "comment": "Incoming freshman at GWU. If you have good stats and think you can get in RD, apply RD. I got in RD and into the University Honors program with a 17k per year merit scholarship. However, I do think they take some financial aid into consideration for the scholarship, which would be good in your case. I got a good financial aid package, so total cost for me is a little less (but almost the same) as my state school, Rutgers. Basically, I'll have to pay around 15k/year out of pocket.\n\nFor context, these are my stats:\n\nAsian, 1370 SAT, 4.1 WGPA, 3.9UWGPA\n\nI took 5 APs: AP bio and APUSH junior year, both Bs. Then, Lit, Comparative Govt, and Micro senior year. All As in senior year first semester. Also, I go to a competitive high school and met with the admissions counselor when she visited my school in October of my senior year, though I'm unsure if that factored in.\n\nEC wise, I was good I guess. Started a club in my senior year, was an active member of two other clubs, attended a 4 day seminar on international affairs at my school, did an online summer course, around 30 volunteer hours. So, not outstanding, but was enough to get in.\n\nMy essays were pretty good, partly because I have an unusual background.\n\nDon't know if this helps, but feel free to DM/PM/whatever it is on reddit me.\n\nBasically, go RD, because if you get in ED but don't get enough financial aid you won't be able to go. And if you have good enough stats, you're safe RD. Try collegevine for a better idea. It gave me a 59% admissions chance, but I got in with merit and honors program.\n\nAlso, once you submit your financial aid stuff. Two weeks after submitting everything, email the financial aid office to see if they need anything else because they didn't tell me I was missing something nor did it show up on my portal. I only found out when I emailed them and they answered my question and were like oh btw, we noticed you haven't sent this in yet. They're doing a similar stupid thing now. Seems like you have to email them and sit on their heads to get the job done. But oh well, I think that's how fin aid offices at most colleges are.",

    "postText": "I'll be attending George Washington University this fall and I am looking for a place to live and a roomate/roommates to live with over the next 2 school years.\n\nI'm an incoming grad student (22, female) aiming to get my MPH (Master of Public Health) in the Health Promotion concentration. I'll be wanting to live somewhere either within walking distance of, or with a relatively easy transportation route to, Foggy Bottom/Milken Institute School of Public Health.\n\nI come from a smallish town and I am currently completing my undergrad at a relatively small campus (this'll be my first time living in a city). I'm a social person but I know how to leave a roommate alone if they aren't interetsted in chatting or going out lmao. I'm also a very clean roommate. Feel free to reply or HMU if you wanna chat about potentially rooming together.",

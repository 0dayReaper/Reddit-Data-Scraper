    "postText": "Hey guys so ED1 decisions are coming out this Thursday and Im extremely nervous. I've always wanted to go to GW but I know for a fact my GPA is not up to par. Freshman year was the worst and I had a 1.8 GPA at the end of it eventually through sophomore and junior year I brought it up to a 3.1 GPA. I explained in my Personal Statement why freshman year was so bad due to personal reasons. Im a Honduran-American Male from NYC and im not submitting SAT/ACT scores. I feel pretty confident in my PS and Supplement. I know no one has the answer to this question but based on what I've said do you guys think I have a shot?\n\nMy EC's:\n\n\\-Internship with the Department of Education and presented a panel to the NYC school chancellor on how to help students facing mental hardships in Covid-19\n\n\\-Organizer at NYCLU discussing environmental racism and SIGH act with students from other NYC Schools\n\n\\-Founder and Reporter for my schools newspaper \n\n\\-Intern for RAP4BX, implemented ideas for a urban farm to local schools for students facing food insecurities \n\n&amp; leader for student research program. I also promoted college readiness creating pamphlets, surveys and educational equality. \n\nBe as honest as you can no hard feelings.",

            "comment": "If your GPA is 1.8, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0 then it\u2019s pretty clear that the 1.8 was a one-off thing that can be explained away so I\u2019d say that in of itself isn\u2019t a dealbreaker. I would be careful about using it in the personal statement, unless it\u2019s part of your story you can include it in the additional information section to avoid taking up your character cap. Test scores would have been nice since they\u2019re important when GPA is abnormal, but it\u2019s a bit late for that.  \n\nYour ECs look pretty solid, much better than mine. If you have a compelling story for your writing portions, your application will be pretty strong. If you\u2019re going for business, IA or the social sciences, these strengths give you an edge. \n\nThat said, you\u2019re definitely taking the rough road here since GWU accepts 1500 SAT 3.9 GPA students by default. Your shaky GPA and lack of test scores may put you a little below competitors, especially in STEM fields with people who can match the caliber of your ECs with more relevant experience and better stats. \n\nTake all online advice with a grain of salt. I would say that you have a good shot if you were applying for a non-STEM major. For STEM, you can still apply but it would depend on your competition. You can also go in undeclared, but my personal opinion is that your odds would be better expressing interest in something like philosophy or business.\n\nWhatever you do, the biggest tip I can give is to make sure your story is cohesive. You want to be able to say \u201cI did this, this and this to gain experience to help me achieve this overall goal, and now I want to study this in college to further help me achieve that same goal.\u201d",

My essay was personal talked about being first-gen and gay but I made sure it didnt come off as a sob story because it all ties to wanting to help my community which is what all my EC's are. I also think my recommenders are great since 1 of them did go to GWU herself.",

Getting 1400+ gives you good odds for merit scholarships. The highest possible merit scholarship you can get without test is 14k a year, you can get double that with a decent SAT. \n\nAPs are great, I definitely regretted not taking more. They give you so many credits and speed you up immensely, I took AP Bio and got 8 credits out of it (which like 9000 dollars worth). Admissions will probably consider your course load when they go over your stuff.\n\nGood luck.",

When you do interviews and writing, you don\u2019t want to harp on and on about your weaknesses, you want to talk about your strengths.\n\nIdeally, you can dismiss it by giving them a good excuse and they don\u2019t bring it up again. Discussing it is not advantageous for you, so the most I\u2019d write about it in the personal essay is maybe one line focusing on how you persevered through a challenging period and learned from it. Avoid making it part of your identity, you want the admissions officers to think of you as \u201cthe candidate with strong initiative and quick wit\u201d and not \u201cthe candidate that got a 1.8 freshman year\u201d. Once again, the way to do this is to mention it as little as possible after providing adequate justification.",

As long as you made sure to talk about your Hispanic heritage and how you\u2019re proud of your culture in your personal statement. I think many of the people responding to your post don\u2019t get that Hispanics are heavily underrepresented at GWU and don\u2019t come from privileged positions. In most of my classes, I\u2019m the only person of color. Many people at this school have parents who were college educated. When you fill out the application, GWU asks you what your parents do for living and whether you\u2019re first gen.  They take everything into account.",

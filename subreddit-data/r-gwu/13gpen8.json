GW does offer a student deal on metro cards which is cheaper than paying for a normal metro card for the school year. \n\nmy only hesitancy is that public transportation isn\u2019t the most reliable and can really switch up on you in an instant, so know your options! there\u2019s also not a lot of metro stops nearby the ashburn one so if that one is closed for whatever reason, you\u2019re a little out of luck. if the silver line is closed\u2026 well.. just hope it isn\u2019t unless you want to make the drive to vienna and try to catch the orange line.  \n\ni\u2019m also pretty sure some of the roads in to DC (route 66? i think?) during rush hour/morning hours turn into specific toll roads that i don\u2019t know much about, but if you meet the toll requirements/HOV requirements you\u2019ll be fine to drive in and you just need to acquire a parking space somehow.",

If I could go back in time, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten an apartment near GW. I would have saved 40k. \n\nI\u2019m guessing you go to campus 3 times a week at most? Just leave early in the morning, take the metro, or honestly just drive it, then go to your classes, grab some lunch in between or study at Gelman, then go home at the end of the day. \n\nI was an undergrad at GW that wanted his own apartment and now I have 30k extra left to pay off. I will starting the part time MBA program at Georgetown in the fall and will be commuting from Fairfax County.",

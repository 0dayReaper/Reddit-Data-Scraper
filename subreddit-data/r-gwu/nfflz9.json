This doesn't sit well with certain vocal faculty groups and have been on a crusade to oust him (you increase STEM and reduce other depts, you see where im going?) Quite frankly, what he's proposing seems reasonable given the current state of the university and the deterioration of student experience. I'd advise you to read his 20/30 plan and make your own conclusion. There's a tendency to assume the most vocal groups represent the majority (it really doesn't. Not everything you read on the hatchet and every posts you see here reflect the overall sentiment of him.",

It isn't a minority.\n\nHe isn't as popular with the admin staff either, but they don't have a \"admin senate\" like the Faculty does, so you can't exactly just do a vote for them.",

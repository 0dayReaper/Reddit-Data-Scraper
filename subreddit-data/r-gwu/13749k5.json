I\u2019m assuming IT just unplugged it and yanked it out at some point? \n\nI had to go down to the CREATE studio, which was a massive PITA (it took them about 45 minutes to print a single thing for me)\n\nI don\u2019t really ever go to Gelman anymore, any idea if this is a recent change or if it\u2019s been gone all year?\n\nOn th\u00e9 plus side, printing at the CREATE studio is free and much higher quality",

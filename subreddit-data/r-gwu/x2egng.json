    "postText": "im in two math classes right now: mathematical ideas with Przytycki and math and politics with foroozan. i was originally just in mathematical ideas but i couldnt understand him so i registered for math and politics and was gonna see which to drop. Przytycki is so sweet but i cant understand one word the man says and the first class he was just naming mathematicians so i have no idea what the class is going to be like. Foroozan is also a little difficult to understand but not to the same extent. We actually did work on the first day too so i have an idea of what the class will be like. I know these are two of the easiest math classes but if anyone has taken either and wants to help me choose please comment thanks",

I switched to Foroozan for M&amp;P and it was definitely the right choice. I feel bad but I\u2019ve had a few professors I had to drop because I couldn\u2019t understand their accents.",

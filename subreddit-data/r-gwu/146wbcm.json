            "comment": "Okay, so I was in the same boat.  The career services are none existent at GWU.  I was jobless for 2 years after being a TA and completing my masters.  It's all about aligning your perception to reality.  And reality rewards BS when dealing with the gatekeepers of recruiters.\n\nThe trick is to establish \\*any\\* continuous employment if you don't get a job after an internship.\n\nI was told by my first employer that they \"took a risk\" by hiring me with no work experience.  I had a Masters, TAed, and was near the top of my class.  They paid me 58K a year (which is really bad as juniors before Covid should of been getting 90-120K).  I quit 1 year in and doubled my salary.  And then 2 years later I quit again and again almost doubled my salary.\n\nIt's bullshit, but it's like car insurance.  First time buying car insurance they charge 600 dollars a month since you're \"uninsured\"; simply switching insurance a month later lowered it down under 100 dollars a month since now I'm \"continuously\" insured.\n\nSo game the system; spam keywords in your resume.\n\n1-page resume is BS; do NOT listen to career services about 1-page resumes.  Fill it up with keywords like Agile, Team Lead, C#, C, [ASP.net](https://ASP.net), or whatever.  The reason why is recruiters are lazy and just want keywords.  Search aggregators like indeed just search for keywords.  Pad your experience, say you started coded in high school.  Doesn't matter if it was a HTML web page, that's \"experience\".  It's all BS: companies say they are \"agile\" while in reality they are \"waterfall\".\n\nAlso Recruiters have a different perspective and can be quite mean if you're unlucky.  It is sadly \"normal\" for recruiters to threaten you or instill negative emotions.  If that happens call them out professionally.  Heck I was told I don't seem to know what I am talking about by a recruiter and am not a good fit for the job even though I was the top pick by their client.  (the question was what is a \"TCP IP Stack\" and I answered is that like the OSI model?  and the recruiter said you're wrong.)  Guess what it is the first four levels of OSI after googling since Jargon is Jargon.  \"I simply in that moment told that recruiter, I was TA, and a student asked me a question I didn't know the answer to.  What did I do?  I pulled up on the projector Google and typed her question in.  Why?  To show students it's okay to not know the answer as long as you know how to find it.\"\n\nEdit: Most importantly, MAKE UP NUMBERS!  Say you're looking for 140-160K even though you might not feel you deserve it out of college.  More often than not, they will entertain that number.  If they ask you how much you make now and you have \\*any\\* CS job, you can just say, \"I'm currently pushing 140K\", even though I made only 58K.  Guess what, they offered me 120K for my second job (pre-covid).\n\nIf you're in the area, I can meet up with you at SEAS as I live nearby.  Just shoot me a PM and I'll eventually check reddit at work xD\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLoyalty is not important.  Do not feel married to your job (the most eye opening experience was quitting a job 3 days in).  They are at-will just as much as you are at-will to them.  The best way to ascend the dominance hierarchy is by leveraging your experience elsewhere.  And if you're good, they will be more than willing to hire you back if you liked the job.  It's not their fault that raises are in a different \"bucket of money\".  Use that rigidity of bloat to your advantage.",

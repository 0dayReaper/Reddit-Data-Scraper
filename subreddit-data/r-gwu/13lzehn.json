For example, we would have a lecture on fingerprints and what is associated with them. Then, in lab, we would work on looking at fingerprints for identification and how to collect them at crime scenes. \n\nWe had a small quiz each week on the previous week\u2019s material, but they weren\u2019t too stressful. The lab reports were the biggest portion of the grade, but the TA\u2019s were very helpful. \n\nWe also had a couple interesting projects. One of them we analyzed an episode of CSI and another we had a mock crime scene where we had to analyze a crime scene and test evidence from the scene. \n\nShe gives you plenty of time to do assignments and is very approachable and reachable.",

I did random for my roommates and we all get along but I want to meet my people and create long lasting genuine connections. I know this means i have to step out of my comfort zone but how do I just take the leap and change my life. I had a tough semester and I want a change",

Personally I\u2019m not too into the campus life (not really GWU\u2019s strength, being smack dab in the middle of the city), but I\u2019ve been able to make friends by doing activities across the city too. (Events, bars, etc\u2026)\n\nThe metro card is a gift. You can go anywhere in the city with it. Bus\u2019s don\u2019t have fares anymore. This city is your oyster and it\u2019s full of great people.",

Not to say there aren\u2019t parties or events, but we\u2019re smack dab in the center of DC. Most people go out in their groups and explore the city than stay on campus.\n\nClub sports are competitive from my experience, great way to make friends too.\n\nI have a friend in environmental studies and he speaks highly of it, can\u2019t speak for myself though.",

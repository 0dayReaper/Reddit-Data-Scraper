    "postText": "Hi, if you have taken any of the classes below, even if it\u2019s with a different professor, could you lmk how important the readings were for doing well in that class. I\u2019m realizing that there all very reading heavy, and if I can, I\u2019d prefer only to read what\u2019s really necessary. \n\nThank you!\n\nPSC 2334- Global Perspectives on Democracy, Michael Miller\n\nIAFF 2101- Qualitative research methods, Nilofar Sakhi\n\nPSC 2476- Arab-Israeli Conflict, Joyce Karam\n\nHIST 2340W- US Diplomatic History, Gregg Brazinsky",

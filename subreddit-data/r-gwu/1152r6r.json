What should I buy/bring to be ready for the complete shift in weather/atmosphere/lifestyle? All help is greatly appreciated.",

I wish I\u2019d had better gloves, and a thicker coat that went to at least my knees. I also learned that scarves are awesome and a necessary part of being comfortable. I also wish I\u2019d had ear protection that did not mess up my hair. \n\nThe wind in DC also worse than the cold sometimes, so I\u2019d make sure that your gear is at least somewhat wind proof. \n\nI hope you have a great time. One of my favorite GW memories is playing flag football in the snow on a completely deserted Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the Whitehouse.",

There's no such thing as bad weather, bad clothing planning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMid-atlantic cold really isn't that bad, snow isn't too common in DC (especially this year). Oh, get some hand warmers off of amazon too, they're great to put into your gloves if you're outside for an extended period of time.",

Layering pieces are huge, so flannels and sweatshirts and zipups are helpful. The winter wasn't too brutal this year so the massive coat I got ended up being overkill this time around, but it's always better to have it and not need it rather than need it and not have it. Also an umbrella or rain coat and some waterproof shoes as it does get pretty wet here from time to time. Also saw that you expressed interest in seeing the leaves change in the fall, if you really want to get the most autumnal beauty hit up the Arboretum, its massive and beautiful and has the best fall foliage of all of DC in my opinion.",

I would recommend gloves with fingertips where you can still touch your phone, a fan for your dorm, a coat that goes at least to your knees, tanktops/t-shirts for easy layering under sweatshirts, and snow-safe shoes just in case. It hasn't snowed yet this year although it did get cold enough over Christmas for the Reflecting Pool to freeze over. Honestly, besides generally lower temperatures, it was about the same as a southeastern winter - plus, its 15 mins max from one end of campus to the other!",

There is police activity everywhere all the time in cities, especially DC, they just don\u2019t send out alerts every time they are nearby. 99% of time the GW ones are followed up with an all clear within 20 minutes, and most of them are technically \u201coff campus\u201d or on the outskirts. \n\nGW campus is quiet and doesn\u2019t have many issues, just follow regular city rules like not walking alone at 2am and not flaunting any expensive items. The \u201cworst\u201d you\u2019ll get is a homeless person either asking for money or just yelling at everything in sight, but just keep walking. \n\nThere are much worse places you can be in DC, Foggy Bottom is definitely one of the safest.",

It's a big city, stuff happens and we get notified about all of it (which is good obviously). Almost everyone takes basic precautions (pepper spray, be smart at night, etc) but very little of the crime you get alerts about actually affects students as far as I know.\n\nBeing integrated into the middle of a city has downsides and unfortunately, a slightly less safe campus is one of them. I would say it's about as safe and maybe slightly safer than living in any major city and a lot of the off campus areas where people live (West End, Arlington, etc) are pretty safe and the dorms have tao access so they're usually pretty safe too",

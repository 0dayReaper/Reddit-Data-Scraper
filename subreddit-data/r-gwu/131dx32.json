So logically, makes sense that they took that to mean that you accepted their offer to pay for your enrollment and proceeded to next steps. A more clear response from you would have been \u201cthank you for this offer! I am still considering my options, the fee waiver definitely helps!\" \n\nthat said, you can still clarify what you meant, you're not contractually obligated to enroll/complete the forms.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am writing this post because I am in a really difficult situation and I could use some advice. I just received an email from the university stating that they are kicking me out due to a violation of my housing agreement.\n\nThe thing is, I rented out my dorm room to a guy who needed a place to stay for a few weeks while he was in town. I thought it would be a good way to make some extra money and help out someone in need. However, I now realize that this was a violation of my housing agreement and that I should have gotten approval from the university before doing this.\n\nI am devastated that I made this mistake and that it has led to me being kicked out of the university. I am currently trying to appeal the decision, but I am not sure if it will be successful. I just don't know what to do.\n\nHas anyone else ever been in a similar situation? Do you have any advice for how to handle this? I would really appreciate any guidance or support.",

I genuinely can\u2019t fathom why you thought that would be okay? Did you just give some random person your GWorld and let them have full access to your dorm and the university over break? Genuinely, how did you not realize how dumb of a decision that is? Do you realize you could face legal consequences for this?\n\nAre you being expelled or kicked out of gw housing?\n\nWhy the fuck are you telling everyone this?",

I agree with others that this violation should\u2019ve been fairly obvious, however, I don\u2019t think we should necessarily pass judgment on why you needed the money so bad. Moreover, I wouldn\u2019t have expected a housing violation like this would lead to complete expulsion.\n\nIn terms of what you can do? Just appeal as best you can and pray for a miracle. Definitely be proactive about it, note how much GW means to you and how you did this honestly as a gesture of goodwill and not to hurt anyone.",

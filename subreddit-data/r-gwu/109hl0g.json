She studies the identity of obesity... was there a very small pool or does the board want to admit its a niche lower tier school rather than reach for the stars? probably money related. So disappointing.",

If we\u2019re talking about hiring from a \u201cpeer\u201d institution meaning a T100 university with an R1 research program, that\u2019s going to be like finding a unicorn in the wild. Mostly because a president has to do a ton of community involvement work, fundraising, and government relations work. If an R1 president is already super well connected in a given location and knows the community really well, they almost never give up the post unless it\u2019s a truly major step up (either a drastically higher ranked university or  moving from a university to a system wide role in cases like the UC system). A school like RIT has a good amount of research for an R2 and she is still rather young for a president of a university. Additionally as to your point about research, this is rather irrelevant. The presidents role has to do way more with relationship management than anything else. There have been some truly amazing university presidents with little to no research background. \n\nI\u2019m not saying she\u2019ll be good or bad. I\u2019m not making any predictions. But nothing you mentioned really correlates to her quality like you think it does. Many ivy leagues often recruit high level management from lower tier universities, so unless you\u2019re positing that Yale and Brown frequently settle for being mid tier institutions, I think you\u2019re misguided.",

This one is low quality based on what you said. \n\nResearch matters because your employees are conducting it daily.\n\nYour point about Ivy leagues is about low level management, not about choosing presidents. \n\nIn my view, this is the board, Speights, deciding GW should settle for being a lower tier niche school instead of striving to compete with better schools. Probably a good business decision for the short term (not competing with georgetown) but will kill the university in the long term (nobody wants to go to a school that has all the negatives of an Ivy League, like price and intellectually homogeneity, but none one the positives, like status.)",

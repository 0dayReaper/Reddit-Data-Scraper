    "postText": "Hey guys, so this has been going on for a while and Im not sure what to do about it. I applied for ED1 and I got an email decisions will be released the 15th but since I made my account, every time I clicked track my app it doesn\u2019t show anything but \u201cCheck Special Programs\u201d and when I click it tells me to check another section. I emailed them about 3 weeks ago and they said they\u2019ll get back to me and still haven\u2019t. I just want to be able to check if I got in or not the 15th through the portal. And when I log-in through the SEAS log-in it says I have not submitted an application at all &amp; Im not sure if this is because I applied via CommonApp? Is this happening to anyone else? What should I do?",

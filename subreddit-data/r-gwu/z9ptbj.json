I\u2019m currently a freshmen in college majoring in chemistry (pre dent). I attend umbc it\u2019s not that bad it\u2019s just not what I want. I wanted to see what gw has to offer specifically in the pre health community/department. Any input about classes ( the difficulty), the community,etc would be highly appreciated and helpful!",

    "postText": "I am currently struggling to make a decision whether to commit to GWSB or Bentley for Marketing. \n\n1. Financial aid-wise, I have to pay 5k less for GW than Bentley. \n\n2. I\u2019m more concerned about internships available for marketing and career outcomes after graduation, since I have heard GW is not particularly known for business. \n\n3. Safety is also a concern, but I guess it comes with living in a city.\n\n4. Prestige? \n\nI currently lean more towards GW, but not sure. Any thoughts are appreciated, thanks!",

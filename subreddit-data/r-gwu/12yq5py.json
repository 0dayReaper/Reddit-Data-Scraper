    "postText": "Incoming first year student here who's committed to GWU Elliott.\n\nI'm currently leaning towards joining the UHP since I want that more academic environment and take classes with students that share that level of intellectual curiosity (not that non-honors students don't).\n\nHowever, there are some drawbacks to the program, especially the course requirements. I would prefer not to take science courses or the humanities ones since there are few options and I'd rather explore topics more interesting to me with my limited electives. Hence, I'm trying to get out of science through AP credit. I'd still like to take origins courses and I know self and society ones can double count towards my major. \n\nAlso, I'm concerned that with studying a language, work-study, and later, internships, I might have too much on my plate regarding the various course requirements. Given my other commitments and the opportunity cost of honors courses, will the UHP be worth it for me? And should I take 4 or 5 courses my first semester (excluding the 1 credit IAFF first year experience)?\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of the UHP as an IR major (potentially business double major or 4+1)?\n\nAdditionally, would AP credit in AP Bio (equivalent to 2 BIO courses) fulfil the UHP science requirement or would I have to take 1 or 2 sciences courses regardless?\n\nAlso, in general, how academic / intellectually driven are GWU students?",

            "comment": "ap credit doesn\u2019t count, but tbh u are MUCH better off taking the UHP sciences courses as a non stem major. they are interesting but also generally easier than the actual science classes at gwu. i don\u2019t know why you would want to take weed out STEM courses instead of the uhp science alternatives. the professors are also generally more understanding. if they still offer your place in nature i highly recommend that course as it\u2019s in a very different field and the professor who teaches it is highly accomplished. also, uhp courses imo supplement the IA degree very well, and the classes work together instead of just being \u201cextra requirements.\u201d they also knock out a few gen eds. i don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be overloaded by any means, and will probably actually have an easier experience. honors offers it\u2019s own macroeconomics course which can replace the broader university one which is easier as well. you also get early registration which helps you a lot in getting good classes.",

With the following courses, is it possible to handle 18 credits and have a job? I've only done 15 credit semesters before. \n\nPhilosophy and Nonviolence (PHIL 2133)\n\nPol Racial Demographics (PSC 3500)\n\nIntro Creative Writing (ENGL 1210)\n\nMarkets and Politics (BADM 2001)\n\nCalc for Soc &amp; Management (MATH 1252)\n\nScope and Methods of PSC (PSC 2101)",

            "comment": "Depends on your motivation and time management skills and also who is teaching these classes. From my experience: I took 18 credits and worked a job 12 hours/week as a bright-eyed and highly motivated freshman and it didn\u2019t faze me at all. Tried to do it again in junior year and the burnout was real and I had to withdraw from a class.\n\nI\u2019ve taken 3 / technically 4 of the classes you listed here. If Philosophy of Nonviolence is with Davis, it\u2019s super easy and she\u2019s generally understanding. Creative Writing is generally easy but depends on who it\u2019s with as well - it will be lots and lots of small assignments that are mostly easy, but if you\u2019re a perfectionist they\u2019ll take a lot of your time. PSC Scope and Methods with Henkin is easy and you just have one big assignment at the end of the semester; any other profs in that class and the workload goes up a lot, weekly quizzes and assignments and much more math-intensive than Henkin\u2019s section (though it looks from your other classes like you might be good at math). My PSC 3500 section was easy but it was a different subject and prof and since it\u2019s technically an advanced class you should be prepared for it to be a lot of work.\n\nIf you manage your time really well and are very self-driven, you\u2019ll be able to do this, but pay attention to how you\u2019re feeling during the add/drop period, put all your due dates from each class on a calendar together when you get all the syllabi to see when you\u2019re going to be busiest and plan in advance, and if it looks like too much, drop one and you might be thanking yourself later.",

In the end I did good but I think I could have done better. But if you have good time management then I think it would work better for you than it did for me. \n\nBut I would say, you probably shouldn\u2019t do it unless you have to. Like you should do it if you need more space other semesters to complete a minor or second major or something like that. If you\u2019re doing it just to have a little bit of a lighter workload later down the line, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the stress. You should also consider though if you have any other commitments, like orgs. If you have any questions you can dm me.",

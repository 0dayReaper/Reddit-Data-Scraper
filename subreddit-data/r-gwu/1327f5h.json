It\u2019s not a super popular dorm so if you rank it as your first choice, you have a good chance of getting placed there. \n\nIf you want to live on the Vern (which I don\u2019t recommend but it\u2019s up to you), West Hall has 4 bedroom/4 person suites. Basically 3 others and you share a bathroom and living room, but you all have your own bedroom within the suite.\n\nI\u2019d recommend Mitchell over West just because I think living in Foggy is nicer but these are the two ways you get a single without DSS.\n\nIf you want a fully single room with a private bath, then you need DSS.",

U can find nicer places sometimes for cheaper that are singles off campus. \n\nOne strategy is to say that the apartment will be a family member or your parents so you'll stay with someone and commute. It's worked with people I know.",

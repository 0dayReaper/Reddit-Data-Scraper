When you're as integrated into the city as GW, there's just so much to do around the city (social life, jobs, internships, etc.) that going to a basketball game just isn't that high on most people's lists\n\nas for tension between the schools, it's college and no one really cares. A lot of club sports have a gw/gu rivalry (I'm on the club frisbee team and we just beat gtown on saturday, bringing our record against them to 9-0), but ime that's a much more of a friendly rivalry than anything with any amout of animosity",

No one\u2019s sad that they go there, and the gtown/GW \u201crivalry\u201d is just like others have said. More rude jokes than anyone actually putting GW down. Both are competitive schools academically, and both have different strengths. \n\nGW is a university that\u2019s very much integrated into the city - more students walk around wearing clothes for internships or whatever they wear casually than wearing head to toe GW gear. IME they\u2019re more interested in watching election votes roll in than going to a basketball game, and take more pride in being people who experience life outside of the college bubble.",

If anything, I think it's a great motivator; while there isn't anything real to it, I feel, especially in Elliott, there is this competitive belief and actual spirit. Ofc we don't actually express it, but it does exist. Additionally, GW has made massive strides in terms of the quality of the experience of the students just in my limited time as a student, I feel that compared to other years my year is far more loyalist and spirited. It feels like we are on the up in the rankings and our generation will be the one to bring the University to its rightful place next to GU.",

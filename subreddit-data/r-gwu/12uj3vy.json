    "postText": "Now that I have like one week left until I have to commit I'm just here ig asking last few questions before I make my decision. So currently I am only looking at three schools: GWU, U of R and John Jay CUNY (w/ Macaulay) and the most important factors for me right now is costs and environment.\n\nI did receive very generous financial aid from GWU (82k) which on paper looks amazing...until I noticed  the amount from federal loans, work-study, health insurance and about 2k for uncovered costs. With this in mind it seems like I'll be paying 14.3k annually if I don't want to gain any interest and my family just can't pay that (&lt;30k annual income). I did receive about 74k in total from GWU and the scholarship but it I'm not exactly sure if I can get anymore from the school.\n\nMy other options being U of R would be cheaper by about a few thousand and John Jay would just be completely free anyway for me as a NYC resident. However, of the three schools GWU seems like it has everything I want, being in a city but not home, great for my major and opportunities. I guess my questions is given my financial situation and perhaps the experiences you guys have at GWU would you say it would be good decision to come to GWU?",

Can you pick a less expensive dorm? What about working this summer @40 hours per week? I\u2019m sure you\u2019re expected to work all summer so earning the extra $3000 is doable. If you don\u2019t do the federal work study, you can also look for paid internships which are becoming more prevalent. \n\nLook into  BS IA with Econ double major instead of polysci. Polysci is too much like IA but econ will give you more skills. The BS International Affairs is a strong option for STEM /Econ focused students. Of course, Compsci is marketable.\n\nYour numbers look awfully close. Taking out loans isn\u2019t great but the federal undergrad ones are manageable if you can budget well. Good luck!",

I also have an ESA cat that helps with my disabillity. Would he be permitted to stay with me given I have the letter from my doctor?",

Last year GW actually offered some pretty decent discounts if you stayed somewhere over the summer and then stayed there again in the fall, not sure if that'll be something that sticks around \n\ncan't speak to the ESA, but I do know a few people on campus with ESAs. Whether they're actually approved through DSS, I'm not sure",

I work for housing, to answer your questions:\n\n1: housing is offered for the academic-year, and is also offered in the summer for another price\n\n2:you are permitted to have your cat, but you would need to get in contact with the DSS office to show documentation.\n\nHope this helps :)",

You just need to provide its vet info and sign a waiver, and make sure your roommates are okay with it.",

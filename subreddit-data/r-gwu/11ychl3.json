It\u2019s there if you wanna join a frat/sorority, but they\u2019ve been struggling with recruitment since COVID (especially frats) \n\nMost people I know either party with an established friend group or within clubs. Club sports are pretty big in my social life, but not sure how representative of the average GW student that is \n\nIn terms of *where* social life is based, a lot of events will happen on-campus (the elliott school has a really nice rooftop for clubs to host events, the student center has a few big ballrooms that get used pretty often). Most parties I go to are either in dorms or off-campus housing, but sometimes people have parties at clubs or hotels nearby \n\nBeing the most centrally located DC school, the city itself is a big part of the social scene. On weekends there are always options for clubbing, concerts, awesome bars, and pretty much anything you can think of",

Today with the shooting at 2400 Virginia Ave, we weren\u2019t alerted until ALMOST 30 MINUTES after shots were fired and the suspect was still at large. The amount of people that person could have killed in 30 minutes without a single student being told there was even a shooter present is terrifying. \n\nIf GWPD cannot even properly alert us when there is an active threat, how can we trust them with weapons? I know they\u2019re going to use 2400 Virginia to justify the need for guns. But their response time proves they are not competent enough.",

I see no issue with arming the GWPD given its an open campus in downtown DC. As another user has correctly pointed out, in an active shooter situation minutes count and we needn't add minutes because we have to wait for the correct police to show up.",

As it stands, Officers only had batons and pepper spray available. This limited GWPD's response tremendously to violent crimes. GWPD already sends Officers to Police Academies in Maryland, doing all the same training side by side with Officers from a variety of full service Departments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDC Law always allowed University Police to be armed (see UDC and Howard University). The only thing keeping GWPD from arming was internal policy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHopefully, even with this new equipment available, it never has to be used. But, if a situation ever calls for it students, faculty, staff, and visitors should feel confident that the GWPD can now better respond to violent acts and protect the community.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy comment from the last time this discussion was going on: https://www.reddit.com/r/gwu/comments/birgei/hatchet\\_editorial\\_board\\_gwpd\\_should\\_hire\\_and\\_arm/em41b78/",

GWPD isn't some rent-a-cop service, and it's clear from the President's email that only a very select group of individuals will be armed.\n\nWe're in the middle of a huge city which also happens to be the #1 or #2 target for an attack on the country. We're also a fully open university, which brings in the dual problems of crime / violence from the outside and inside (as we've seen with countless university shootings this year). These aren't just some random hypotheticals; are we forgetting the guy who just showed up shot outside the Metro last week? The fact some of GWPD *wasn't* armed to begin with should've already been cause for concern.\n\nAnd the people saying \"all other law enforcement is just a minute more away, what's the big deal?\" are entirely missing the point. First of all, if the distrust is of guns or law enforcement generally, then why do you find it more comforting MPD will be the responders and not GWPD? Second, provided that GWPD undergoes the same training as everyone else, why *wouldn't* you want the school's dedicated police force to respond to a school crisis? GWPD knows our campus and are always going to be on the scene. Why waste precious seconds depriving them of the tools they need?\n\nI swear, some people are acting like arming GWPD is equivalent to turning them into the Terminators.",

Our country unfortunately has a huge problem with mass shootings, especially on campuses, so GW has to prepare for that threat. \n\nCrime is also on the rise in DC and honestly, there are a decent amount of crazy/drug-addicted homeless people who have been known to cause problems and harass people around the campus. Not all homeless cause problems, a lot are just good people down on their luck. But there are also some who are on drugs and fucking crazy, and as someone who used to work at a CVS off campus, I have seen dangerous situations arise. I hope they can get help, our country doesn\u2019t do a good job at rehabilitation. But myself and a lot of my friends have been harassed or made to feel threatened on/near campus, and my female friends especially have felt unsafe at times. I hope this kind of situation never escalates to the point where armed force is needed, you never want to see that happen. But it\u2019s a good idea to be prepared to respond to such a threat with the right resources. \n\nI think it would be irresponsible to not arm GWPD given these issues.",

Back in 2018 when there was a shooting out front of the hospital, GWPD was on scene first, to the point that people were pointing the direction the shooter went expecting us to give chase. With just batons and pepper spray, that wasn't happening. Two minutes later, yes, MPD showed up. But two minutes is a long, long time when you think a shooter is on the loose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGWU is right smack dab in the center of the city. There's no wall or fence around the campus. It is very open to the community. This openness brings so much opportunity and life to the campus, but it also brings with it risk. Check out the crime log on the GWPD website. There are violent crimes on campus, and there is always the risk of some kind of active threat type incident.\n\nEDIT: And just to further illustrate my point, there was just a shooting at 2400 Virginia Ave NW, right behind Shenkman.  Say the suspect fled East onto campus and GWPD got a lookout for the suspects description. Without a firearm no Officer is going to go look for the suspect, what would they do if they found them? Point their baton at them? With firearms GWPD is better able to actually respond and handle violent crimes.",

I agree - if calling GWPD elicited a SWAT-like response in every circumstance, nobody would call them. But if there's a life-or-death emergency on campus, I'd like to think they'd show up with the means to respond.\n\nThese comments disappoint me b/c a lot of people seem blind to the problems around them. In my freshman year I was threatened for my wallet and phone like a block away from campus, that's when I realized you need to be vigilant around here. Since then, we haven't had any major incident (thank God), but this campus is anything but safe. Not only did we have the armed robbery of students' jackets and the guy who got shot at (around) the Metro last week, but a quick Google unsurprisingly shows GW students being victimized in this area is sadly not an uncommon occurrence.",

As I\u2019ve said elsewhere, and the President said himself, nobody\u2019s arming the entire police force.

(just cause I see a few comments below citing this as a big reason)\nif a cop wasn\u2019t anywhere in sight to help then, what would it matter if a cop was armed \u2014 but still too far to notice or help?\n\nand let\u2019s say the cop IS there. what\u2019s he doing with the weapon then? is it to threaten the guy to freeze? what happens to him if he doesn\u2019t? \n\nWith all the school shootings, I don\u2019t know how to feel. I keep thinking about how I was incredibly uncomfortable during covid when my [very safe side of] campus had cops with guns half my height on every corner.\n\nI wonder if the answer is having a specific response team in a car that\u2019s armed and circling the hospital/metro area (but ready to hit the gas if an issue is elsewhere). But I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m curious to hear how the gun would actually help with the crimes that do happen regularly here. Obviously I\u2019m not a cop, so I\u2019m just assuming at least a few would just run away anyway and I\u2019m hoping people don\u2019t get shot for \u201cresisting\u201d or running or something.",

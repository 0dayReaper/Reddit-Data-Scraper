    "postText": "Aid from GWU makes cost similar to in-state UCSB cost. Majored IA (Elliott) at GWU, Polisci at UCSB. Hoping to break into nonprofit sector or run for office depending on how things turn out. UCSB has a better school social scene (i think), but GWU has better IA program. \n\nA bit about me because I feel like it's relevant: I was a lottery student a public school surrounded by kids from a higher income bracket\u2014dealt with a lot of classism from snobby rich kids and grew from it. I say this because I feel like\u2014from the vibes I'm getting\u2014my type of personality would fit in well with the GWU go-getter school spirit. idk\n\nAny thoughts or considerations on making this decision are appreciated.",

            "comment": "I come from white trash squalor, which is probably what got me into GW a long time ago.  Was definitely surrounded by a lot of kids who came from much more than I did.  But 30 years later I'm still friends with many of them.\n\nWe looked at UCSB for one of my kids, really liked it, and you will get a good education there, whatever your major.  He was looking at Engineering, though.  But in my career I've met many from UCSB who wound up in tech and science fields, and I can say they were all doing well.\n\nThing about GW, though, is that if you are in with the Elliott and Columbian college kids... they are informed.  Smart.  Opinionated, and often able to back it up.  We'd sit there over beer late and night and argue politics and policy all night, and my friend group spanned the political spectrum. Who the hell spends 6 hours until 4.in the morning debating whether English should be the national language??  I'll tell you who.  GW students.  \n\nI learned at GW I didn't have the temperament or stomach for politics or government.   I really do miss my undergrad days.  The conversations I've had in the 30-years+ have never been nearly as good.  And you can find great barstool conversation in DC, too.\n\nYou would be surrounded by the kind of places you might like to meet a career in.  Jobs and internships are readily available.\n\nHope that helps.  Just one old guy's point of view.",

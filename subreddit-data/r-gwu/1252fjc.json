It is a liberal arts school that is light on the science options.   A truly international experience as well- my daughter has befriended folks from Lebanon, Germany, and France.   Also, your student will meet folks from across the US.    Being a truly urban environment, it's also a good introduction for some-- as the Foggy Bottom campus will be a somewhat similar experience to the AUP urban campus.",

            "comment": "The biggest caution with the program in my eyes is comparing it financially with your other options. My daughter chose this program over a half dozen other schools all of which awarded her scholarships-- primarily because GW was her priority school choice. With this being a transfer program, we were disappointed that GWU did not award her one cent of scholarship or grant after she completed the AUP program. So, bear that in mind in your decision process if you think it should be a factor.",

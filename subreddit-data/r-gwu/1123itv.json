I know class workload can be heavy but we do have a ton of free time in college, especially if you're not working another job or internship at the moment, so I'd encourage you to use the time you do have to keep applying until something sticks. And yeah, a lot of times your app will not get any response, that's unfortunately just part of the game.",

Depending on what you want to do, professional frats may/may not be very helpful \n\nSpeaking from personal experience, I interned in both the house and senate freshman year. It\u2019s not that hard to do (or to get those positions), and I didn\u2019t even formally apply for either position. I just got a referral from a friend, had quick phone calls with someone in the office to make sure I wasn\u2019t a serial killer, and then boom, \u201ccan you start tomorrow?\u201d\n\nAlso just a note: Elliott career advising used to be pretty great, then Elizabeth Boesen left and it went way downhill (the academic advisors are still top tier, shoutout to Ms. Washington), CCAS advising has always sucked, GWSB advising is pretty solid (at least as far as non-targets go), and I can\u2019t speak to SMPA or SEAS. By and large though I wouldn\u2019t trust most of what the career advisors have to say. Just talk to upperclassmen/alumni who\u2019ve done stuff you\u2019re interested in",

It may be difficult as a freshman but some places absolutely do offer spots to people in your position. INot a bid idea to search for \"early college internships\" or something like that. As others said, get on the Handshake / LinkedIn grind and I would say to apply to 2-3 things a week. Some apps will get lost into nothingness but others may open surprising doors. \n\nThe Career Center is probably best used as Resume/Cover Letter review rather than asking them what action steps you should be taking on your own. If you find a company/place you really like, you can go the extra mile and try to find someone on LinkedIn, ideally who went to GWU, to reach out to and ask if you can exchange emails / set up a brief call to talk about their experience at the company.\n\nIt's a really draining process, so keep your head up. Good luck!",

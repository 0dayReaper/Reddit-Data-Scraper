Revolutionaries could be revolting against anything, what the hell does a blue fog do?\n\nEdit: obviously hippo is better than either but if it's a choice between Blue Fog and Revolutionaries then I think the choice is clear if you let go of your incessant desire to hate everything the school does (don't worry I have it too).",

So since the premise is that if anything or anyone has a negative history associated with it, no matter it\u2019s good countervailing qualities, the name of the University must also be changed. George Washington was just as much a part of the bad of colonialism as anyone. For the record, I disagree with all of this.

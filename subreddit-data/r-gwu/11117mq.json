    "postText": "I got accepted in GWU to start as a first-year in the fall, but the price tag is simply unrealistic for me. My current plan is to knock out some gen-eds at a state school in the fall and then transfer to GWU in a year or two. Does anyone have any insight on how transfer-friendly GWU is? Any tips would also be super appreciated! Thank you in advance!",

            "comment": "Transferred from a state school after my sophomore year. GWU gave me by far the most transfer credits out of any school I was accepted to (American, Rhodes, Georgetown, etc.) They also gave me very generous financial aid as a transfer.\n\nGW pretty much will take any course that isn\u2019t a pass fail. \n\nHowever if you\u2019re planning in transferring to arts and sciences, gen eds don\u2019t get the course attributes that you need in order to function as gen eds. You\u2019re best off focusing on essential classes like calc than necessarily ones focused on arts or lab sciences.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",

Did you take APs in high school and if so, did you have trouble transferring \"credit\" for classes you didn't take in college?  \n2. Do you think it extended/impeded on your graduation track at all?   \n3. Do you have anything else you wish you had known before transferring?   \nThank you in advance! I appreciate your time :)",

No, but since I changed majors, I have an extremely compressed schedule with no room for error.\n\n3. Honestly GWU is exactly as advertised. You have to be a self starter here, in classes, socially, etc.. Don\u2019t waste your time waiting for life to come to you. Also dating in DC is as bad as everyone says it is lol.",

I know CC\u2019s get a bad rep, but they\u2019re super cheap (free in some states) and allow more flexibility in how many classes you can take due to 8week and hybrid classes. GW is very lenient with transferring classes, typically as long as the title matches they\u2019ll allow it, but you can always petition departments and argue and they\u2019ll usually come to a compromise.",

            "comment": "Former transfer, recent grad here!\n\nTransferring credits is super doable. I was able to transfer over a good amount of gen-eds plus a couple in my major! \n\nThe biggest thing for transferring credits is literally how similar they are to the course name. When I tried to transfer credits that were relatively similar classes but with different names, they got rejected. But when I transferred credits for classes with the same name but different content, they were accepted! They were least willing to transfer lab sciences tho iirc. \n\nWhen you transfer AP credits, you don\u2019t transfer the credit you got at your secondary school. You just apply the AP credit to whatever course it would cover normally. So I\u2019d line up the AP classes you have plus the available courses at your first college, then choose ones that fulfill different reqs but have similar names to other GW classes. \n\nWhen I called an admissions officer, they said that the most important thing when transferring is GPA. According to the kind woman in the office I spoke to, if you have a 3.5 you have a 50% chance of getting in. Then, your chances increase with every .1 of GPA. This is true even if you go to a state school! I went to a small local private that was probably below your average state school, but they loved my 4.0 (and my money). They were able to meet my FAFSA, but I didn\u2019t get any extra money besides a scholarship in my major that I won as a junior. \n\nTransferring to GW was the best and most important decision I\u2019ve ever made. Can\u2019t recommend it enough, esp if you want to stay in DC and work in politics or smth! Lmk if you have any questions",

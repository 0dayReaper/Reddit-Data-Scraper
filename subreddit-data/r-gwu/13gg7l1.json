I recently received an offer from GWU and will be moving to DC  around June 25th.\n\nMy budget is around $1.5k-$2k per month, but it's flexible depending on the condo or the roommate =).\nIdeally, I'd like to be within a 20-minute bike ride to GWU or near a Metro station (in which case, I can live farther away).\n\nI am a tidy and quiet individual and I am seeking a roommate who shares these qualities. Please message me and maybe we can become roommates. =)",

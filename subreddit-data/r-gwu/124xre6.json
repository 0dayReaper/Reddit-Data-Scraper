They accepted you for spring and spring only, and it sucks and doesn't make sense. But don't worry!  There may be study abroad programs and you should be able to contact the study abroad office for that, but they won't offer any to you so do your own research. But generally, the whole spring admit system is a MESS. Like genuinely I'm happy I'm here, but it was nearly not worth it, especially for the cost and stress. Being a spring admit student is very uncomfortable in the fall and you just generally feel socially and academically behind unless you really really work hard to get up to that level. \n\nIf you have a close second choice that's maybe cheaper or you got admitted for fall, heavily consider it, but if a study abroad opportunity is available that would be great!",

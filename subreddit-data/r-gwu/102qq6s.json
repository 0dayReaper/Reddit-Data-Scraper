    "postText": "I\u2019m a GW freshman and I\u2019m wondering more about the dining plan for the spring semester. I selected the Unlimited + $500. I ate at the dining hall literally 1 time (not including District). I went to Whole Foods (I know they\u2019re getting rid of gworld regardless) all the time plus other places. So will I only have $500 to spend this semester at the partner places and they expect the rest to be at the dining hall? If so, DAMN.",

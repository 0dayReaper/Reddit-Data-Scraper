    "postText": "No one on my floor or entire dorm building knows or talks to each other, to my knowledge. I tried joining lots of clubs when I first got here, but most the programs and activities only last 1 or 2 hours, and are only once every 2-3 weeks, then it\u2019s back to being alone. All my classes are big and there\u2019s hardly anyone talking in them. My roommate won\u2019t talk to me, idk why, I\u2019m just perpetually alone here it\u2019s driving me a bit crazy.\n\nI mean how the hell did sophomores and freshmen make friends after getting here, even just friendly acquaintances? The people I\u2019ve talked to who seem to have some, got theres from their dorm situation. Should I just switch dorms? I\u2019m at a loss and am becoming seriously depressed, spending this much time without talking to a single human being outside cashiers at CVS is not healthy",

But it takes a bit of effort and trial and error on your part to get that snowball rolling. Also search for a house/apartment with roommates if you are thinking of moving out of the dorm. I feel for you though, the initial stages of forming a community can be quite isolating and depressing. Hang in there, it does get easier after laying down some ground work :)",

It somehow just clicked. Also my current semester is very social thus it was quite easy to find lots of people to talk to and get along with. But our situation is different because we spent a lot of time together in the lab. On top we're only around 60 people.  \nI also have my archery lessons when I can interact with the students and my colleagues (we coaches help each other out). Maybe I was lucky because I started with studying and my courses way before Corona. And I was lucky to have such a great neighbour. Are you allowed/able to meet with people you already know? Can you meet up with new people you met? How is the situation at the dorm? Do you share a room or a small flat with your mate? I think it's a problem if two people are randomly put together. In a dorm it's difficult but where I live there are no dorms where you share a room. Maybe you can find a dorm with that kind of situation (if available)? On another note: how long do you feel like this? Since October? If you can answer a few of my questions I can maybe help out a bit more.",

If I stayed I\u2019d switch to being a history major, but this school is not at all worth a BA in history and 3 more years of isolation, for me personally. So I\u2019m probably gonna drop out \n\nThank u for your response, also in hindsight I should\u2019ve done some sports intramurals that just didn\u2019t occur to me for some reason",

I'm at university for quite some time now and for the first few semesters I did nothing. I was busy with lectures, lab and meeting my partner during the weekends. My days were just fully packed and I just had no energy left to do anything. It's still similar but I just take my time which is why I'm still at university.\nI'm sorry to hear the general situation about how you feel about your BA. You still put time and effort into it and I think it must feel frustrating to just drop it. Is there something else that you can look forward to?",

I often hear about students who just started studying because...yeah, why? They don't really know it themselves and do it because everyone does. Is there a job that you aspire after? Sometimes an apprenticeship is already sufficient. I suffer quite a bit at university but I know where I want to go (more or less) and I know that I have to go through this time but in the end I will be able to work in the field that I was looking for. Why exactly do you \"hate\" STEM? What is it that you don't like about it? Then again: what is it that you like about your current area of study? I sometimes wish I had known about the job as conservator when I was still at school. I loved (and still love) paintings etc (don't want to go into that much detail right now) and I think I'd have become quite happy in that area. I just didn't know about that job. That's another thing that happens to many who come from a family where almost nobody ever studied at university and where everybody has a plain vanilla job (like working at the post office, nurse, etc.). My school didn't provide me with ideas either. Without decent help you might end up in a job you THINK you can do/like but in the end that job might make you unhappy.  \nSwitch your area if it makes you upset. Write down pros and cons and also include your social situation as you mentioned it. Try to find out if there's a doable way to fix it. It's never easy and the chances might be high you're left alone with these problems. I wish you the best of luck! Being unhappy with what you do is the worst and being alone or feeling lonely on top is a combination made for disaster. I'll cross my fingers for you so that you find a new opportunity :).",

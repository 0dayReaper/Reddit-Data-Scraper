GW is also home to the Alpha Chapter of Delta Iota Gamma (DIG), the Anth/Arch pre-professional fraternity. There are also great opportunities with internships and jobs. For example I had a long-term job with The Textile Museum where I actually worked with ancient artifacts.\n\nEdit: To add, there are a lot of students in both programs, particularly Bio Anth, and all the students generally know each other due to class sizes (medium to small) and because most majors are in DIG.",

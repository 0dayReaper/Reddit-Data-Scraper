    "postText": "Hi all, my friend told me that undergrad presidential scholarships last 5 years, which would make a huge difference for me financially in terms of my 5th year at GW for grad school. Does anyone know for certain if: \n\n1) the scholarships do in fact carry into a 5th year masters program \n\n2) where to find that information in writing \n\nI can\u2019t even find my original award offer letter on banweb - it says \u201cno outside resource info available for you at this time\u201d",

            "comment": "To my knowledge, the Presidential Scholarship only apply a to undergraduate degrees. I discussed this with my advisor and the general idea is it that financial aid is hard to find for graduate school. The Presidential Scholarship DOES last for five years though, but it\u2019s just in case you need to do an extra year of undergrad.",

            "comment": "As the other commenter said, the undergrad scholarship doesn't carry over. If you're doing a 5 year BS/MS program, you also forgo additional GW scholarship for your 5th year (they argue that the classes you take as an undergrad are the tuition help so you can't get more). \n\nThere is a 10% tuition reduction you can get for doing grad at gw after your undergrad and you are still eligible for TAships in some departments (depends on the department and whether they require 2 yrs or only 1). \n\nThis is based on my experience as a 5 yr student here.\n\nHope this helps!",

I dont think that it would carry over into grad programs, but im not certain. I dont know how this would work with those 4 + 1 programs though, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about doing. I would just email the financial aid office because they\u2019re really the only ones who would know",

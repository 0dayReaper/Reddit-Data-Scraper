They definitely didn\u2019t get any pictures of me during the ceremony because I was like 15 deep into a row on both sides.  \n\nWe took pictures after in the Enid A. Haupt Garden and it was relatively quiet and we got some really good pictures.",

It was managed pretty well, but family should get there early to get good seats near the big screens. Family seating is maybe 75 rows away from the stage, so all you can see from there are the giant TV screens they put half way through. For the graduate, I wouldn\u2019t rush, it\u2019s not really like you get to pick your seat, you just end up where you end up.",

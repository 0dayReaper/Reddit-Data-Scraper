    "postText": "Hi , I've been admitted to both GWU and Georgetown for grad school; I'll be studying strategic public relations.  I'm hoping this puts me on a path to political consulting/lobbying/strategy/advocacy.\n\nWhile GWU's program is more aligned with my interest than Georgetown, I'm trying to determine how much more the Georgetown reputation and alumni base is worth - both in DC and the rest of the country? \n\nI need to commit to one school soon and any feedback here is welcome and appreciated.  Thanks!",

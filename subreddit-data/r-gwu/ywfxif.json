You probably don't *technically* need experience with it, but it is assumed that if you don't you have done a lot of independent work previously.\n\nAs it is, OP posted this basically indicating they don't really know anything about the field, did it just to \"change careers\", and then made a post as if this all happened in a vacuum.  I'm unaware of any technical grad program at an R1 university that considers itself a clean slate program.  \n\nGo to Strayer if you've never touched a computer but want something that says you have a Master's level understanding of cyber security(you will not).",

At a glance for the courses required for the [Policy and Compliance](https://onlinecybersecurity.seas.gwu.edu/me-cybersecurity-policy-compliance/#section-courses) track, I don't think you absolutely need experience with either cyber security or IT/IT-adjacent work, but it would be certainly helpful.  If you don't have it it'll be a very hard slog.  \n\nA word of warning though; if someone's resume with no experience in the field or IT and just this MEng landed on my desk for a cyber related position, I probably would not take it seriously.  It looks like you're a teacher?  You probably need to get into the field first *in addition to* this degree if you really want a successful career change.",

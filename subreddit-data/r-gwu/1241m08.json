I didn\u2019t even dwell on that in my application because I was more interested in showing off who I am, especially as someone with ADHD. \n\nIdk, GWU was my top school and I really want to study International Relations and take their classes on The American City but the past month of rejections has turned my world upside down. I also was super interested in NROTC at GWU but now I don\u2019t see a point anymore.",

(source - I have ADHD and also struggled during COVID) It might feel like important context, but it just reads as an excuse to admissions officers. So many of us have ADHD these days that it really isn't that impressive of a struggle to overcome in the eyes of admissions officers (not saying that it's not something you should be proud of, navigating any mental health diagnosis is something to be proud of - but it is not a unique challenge). I originally wrote my college essay about my mental health struggles but I was given the (painful, but critical) guidance that it was not a compelling subject to write about for admission and didn't set me apart or make me unique. I'm sorry someone was not able to give you the same advice prior to submitting your application, but I am rooting for you to get off the waitlist and wishing you the most success with where you are now.",

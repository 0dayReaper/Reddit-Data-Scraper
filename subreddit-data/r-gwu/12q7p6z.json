    "postText": "Hi, everyone. I\u2019m an incoming MA student in the Security Policy Studies program. I\u2019m moving from NY, looking at an August 1st move in date. \n\nBefore I find an apartment, I thought it would be smart to find a job down in DC first. I\u2019m trying to find stuff on indeed/linkedin, and I\u2019ve have applied for a handful of stuff, but I don\u2019t even know if places will consider me like 4 months in advance of starting. \n\nI\u2019ve never moved out before, much less out of state, so I didn\u2019t know if anyone would have any advice for this process. I\u2019ve been applying for like two days, but am already nervous of not finding something in time to secure myself financially before I move down there.",

If you're still smoking weed and have fun with pharmaceuticals stop now so that you can pass background checks and make the clearance process go smoother. Getting security clearance will be the single most important thing to getting a job in that field. I also will say to keep applying and keep editing your resume and cover letter for each specific job, if you're just quick applying on linkedin and indeed it likely won't go anywhere. Job searching here can be exhausting and discouraging but don't give up if it doesn't go anywhere for the first few months. Also take advantage of any sort of professional networking opportunities and get any additional certifications to boost your resume. It's hard but don't get discouraged!",

            "comment": "DC would be the perfect place to get started on your career in your field.\n\nThe easiest way forward would be to intern for the State Department or other Governmental Institutions and get sponsored for a Clearance.  There are also numerous think tanks where you can regularly attend for talks and get to meet people.\n\nIn terms of getting your first job; that's the hardest step; you can always change jobs 6 months in once you establish continuous employment to double your salary, so don't worry too much about getting a great salary out of college.",

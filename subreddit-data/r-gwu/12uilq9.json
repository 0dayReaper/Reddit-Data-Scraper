    "postText": "This is my first semester taking summer courses and was hoping to get some insight as towards how heavy they are. I understand that they cram lots of content into a few weeks, so I\u2019d assume they are higher pressure than regular courses.\n\nI\u2019m considering 18 credits this summer, split 12-6 between the two periods. My first period has one online and one hybrid course. I have no other required commitments aside from school, and regularly take 18 credits during the regular semesters. I\u2019m curious as to whether this is considered as a manageable workload.",

            "comment": "i would highly suggest not taking 18 credits over the summer. it\u2019s a shit ton of money because you get no financial aid over the summer. plus it\u2019s the same amount of information you learn in 14 weeks but instead it\u2019s in 6 weeks. yea it can be cheaper to take a few summer courses over the 4 years instead of having to take an extra semester or year but it\u2019s not cheaper to do a full semester over the summer.",

I\u2019ve already got a job offer and hopefully graduate admissions lined up overseas so I\u2019d like to hop on those as quickly as possible.",

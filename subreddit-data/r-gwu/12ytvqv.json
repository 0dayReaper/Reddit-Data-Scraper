    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m an incoming GW freshman and based off my cost of attendance and the conditions I want for my dorm, I\u2019m going to have to look towards the Vern (which I\u2019ve heard I should avoid).\nThe only real advantage is that Vern will be easier for my family to come get me considering I live like 25 minutes past Potomac in Maryland.\n\n\n Anyway, I was wondering how the commute from Mount Vernon to Foggy Bottom and back is. Is the shuttle consistent or at least good enough for me to get to my classes on time? \n\nAlso, Vern has a dining hall\u2026right? \n\nI appreciate the help in advance.",

            "comment": "Howdy!  I commuted all 6 years including freshman year at GW from a similar area; I recommend against commuting the first two years.  I also do not recommend the Vern but it is a better option than staying at home.  You'll still have to \"commute\" to social functions and classes.  This does become bothersome since many social functions are spontaneous.\n\nThe benefit of leaving home first before returning is that you'll have an easier time making friends and attending social functions.  The secondary benefit is that it helps set a boundary between you and your parents; this may not seem important now, but this step is important for you developing your own sense of self.\n\nIf you'ld like to save money, live at home the last two years.  The commute is straightforward: roughly 45 minutes at 8:00AM, and 25 minutes outside of rush hour.  If you're reckless you can get that consistently under 20 minutes ;-)",

Vex wise is usually pretty reliable during the day, at night it becomes more iffy.  Pelham is fine, I would say it\u2019s about the same as the other dining halls food wise (all same company). The Vern has some nice trails nearby, a cvs around the corner, a couple of restaurants, etc. if you really want to avoid the commute just pack to stay on foggy all day. If you do decide to live here shoot for west hall.",

West is super nice and there was a very lively and friendly social scene on the floors when I was there. People would leave their doors open and make friends and hang out. It's close to a Safeway, so you can save money by buying groceries and cooking your own food. But yes, they do have a dining hall. The commute is fine. It's all depends on traffic, so leave early if you have a class during rush hour. I'd usually stay on Foggy Bottom for the day. The vex runs at all hour so you'll never be stranded. And imo, all of it was totally worth it to have my own room.",

West has the best interior of any freshman dorm, and has a gym, a dining hall, and a package room. The vex takes 15-20 mins on average, and you get free coffee at buffnbrew. Only downside is if you want to go out at night, you have to take the vex over. Ignoring the commute/location, West is probably the best dorm on campus. I\u2019d still reccomend an apartment in foggy with someone if u want to save money, but the Vern isn\u2019t the worst option",

I know people that have lived on the vern and people that do it now and they survive. I myself have not lived on the vern.  Also yes the vern has a dining hall and its own package center and gym. it's hilly which is annoying, but the vibe is kinda neat, feels like a small college campus when ur there.",

It reminds me of a small liberal arts college but you also get the benefits of a comprehensive urban university. You should definitely consider the cost of commuting from home versus living on campus if finances are a concern, especially considering that the cost of living in DC is insane. The Vern dining hall is actually my favorite -- it's small comparatively but very consistent and they always have something good to eat imo. You will also take at least one class on MVC during your freshman year which will offset the commute costs.",

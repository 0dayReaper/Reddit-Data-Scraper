However, top 10 firms like RSM also recruit at GW if you are looking for a better work life balance. I highly recommend that you go to GW\u2019s career fairs or info sessions that are targeted towards freshmen and sophomores to better give you an idea of what kind of firm you want to work at, but also doing research online and looking at the accounting Reddit can help you make your decision. If you\u2019re a freshman I wouldn\u2019t make your decision solely based on recruitment at each school since as long as you are good at networking and attend info sessions you can get a job anywhere in public accounting.",

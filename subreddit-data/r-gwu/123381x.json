    "postText": "Hey guys. I\u2019m currently a first-year and the transition it to college was definitely challenging for me. I was placed on academic probation the first semester and received a warning. I\u2019m getting concerned that I won\u2019t do well this semester as well placing me on probation for 2 straight semesters. I\u2019m getting very concerned that I could get suspended or even kicked out. Are there any ways?? Talking to advisors or counseling?",

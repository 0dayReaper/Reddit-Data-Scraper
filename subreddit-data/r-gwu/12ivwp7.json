I\u2019m trying to figure out what I want to take in which order and since it doesn\u2019t really matter I\u2019ll do it by Professor quality and offerings based on what\u2019s available this semester and reviews.\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated.",

Do the TAs grade other assignments fairly? Do you feel like that workload is manageable or has it been way too much? Thanks so much",

Basically the entire course is done online, the lectures are based on slides that are posted, the textbook is online and the quizzes ( which are also online) are also based on the textbook readings almost entirely and he drops 2 out of the 7 so it\u2019s based on your five highest. the midterm is a take home case study that he gives you two hours to do, mine was a little over 1k words and I got an A, it doesn\u2019t have to be long.",

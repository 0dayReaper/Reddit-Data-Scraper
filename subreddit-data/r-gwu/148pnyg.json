    "postText": "Hi People, I\u2019m a grad student moving to the DC area for my masters. A few people have told me about empire apartments and how they loved it, then I went on google reviews &amp; saw there were a few roach complaints. I will please like to find out if anyone has lived there and the general reviews of the building? \n\nThank you so much.",

Definitely had a few roaches, but tbh even my friends in the $3000 Varsity apartments who cleaned obsessively had occasional roaches, it just kinda comes with the territory of living in the city. If you're looking for a completely roach-less apartment than downtown DC is not the place for you.",

The amenities weren't great compared to others in the area, but it really wasn't bad all things considered. We were paying $1450 for a 450 square foot studio in 2020, but I'm sure prices have gone up in the last few years, but it's still way more affordable than the fancier options like the Ave and Varsity. I think it's a solid option for folks wanting to save money who don't mind not having the nicest prettiest accommodations.",

It's another solid budget option compared to the hyperinflated West-End/Foggy Bottom luxury buildings, I would say it's pretty comparable to Empire. The units are a little larger and a little nicer than Empire if I'm remembering correctly but not by a significant margin.",

You just have to check some specific boxes in your housing app to verify that you are aware of and okay with rooming with someone who isn't your gender (or maybe you don't anymore - I didn't go co-ed this year but have in the past).",

I think it only prompts you to check some boxes if your chosen roommate is not your gender (but like I said, they may have changed this). If you're going random, I think they try to assign by non-co-ed. Someone else may be able to speak on that specifically.\n\nEdit: for context, I was in a co-ed room for the 21-22 year. And I would've been the year before as well if we hadn't been online.",

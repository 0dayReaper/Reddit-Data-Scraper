I am working on sending transaction forms to teachers so I can be placed in their classes (taking pre-req over the summer) and am confused on some of it. What am I supposed to put in for course(I assume the course title XXXX 1234) is that correct? Also what do I put in for level (is that just whether it is a 1,2,3 level course?)",

            "comment": "the course title is the actual name of the class. for subject you put the xxxx and then for course you put the numbers. and then level is 01, 02, 03, 04",

I'm not sure about the level, but it might be either Undergraduate or Graduate?\n\n\nI honestly think they'll accept it if you do it any way, as long as you give them all the courses' info they need to make the changes you want. Try asking the GW Hub when they open tomorrow.",

Pick a lane and stick to it, but what they are doing just pisses everyone off. People that want full in person are mad about most of campus still being closed, and those that want virtual now have to come back to a still mostly closed campus. \n\nIf it\u2019s too bad to open the gym and club sports, how can we have full classes? By the same token if it\u2019s ok to have classes how is it\u2019s so bad that the gym and sports have to be closed? Also they want to go full throttle on the 1st. Is omicron just going to magically be gone at midnight on the 31st?\n\nAm I happy we are going back in person? Absolutely. But does what they are doing follow any logic? No.",

What was the point of doing virtual exams last semester due to spiking cases, now when we have almost 10% positive test rate it\u2019s ok to be in person?\n\nI don\u2019t see being in-person as a permanent thing and that\u2019s what irritates me. I\u2019d rather be at home than stuck in a tiny studio in dc staring at a screen.",

One of the other students couldn\u2019t make it bc she\u2019s quarantining at home due to covid and he said, \u201cwell at least you won\u2019t get it here. they\u2019re shoving us all into classrooms next week with with no social distancing protocols, so expect to be in person for 2-3 weeks then virtual in february. it\u2019s all for money\u201d. and i was like UM\u2026..OKAY THANKS MAN. tea sir. teaaaaa\n\nEdit: the MAIN reason they want to be in person until at LEAST february 1st is due to the money they get from undergraduate housing. if a student stays in a dorm past january 31st, they don\u2019t get their housing money back. if students leave before january 31st, they get a full refund for the semester. announcing that we should expect to be virtual for \u201cX\u201d amount of weeks would cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars (if not over 1 million) if students knew they wouldn\u2019t be in person at all in Jan. housing is about 18k per semester here. these protocols are allllll for money i guarantee\n\nEdit 2: Cost of housing per year ($15,000) x number of students living in campus housing (6,500) = $97,500,000, or $48,750,000/semester. That\u2019s what they\u2019re protecting here I\u2019m guessing. Makes sense",

So I don\u2019t know why getting COVID is met with such punitive measures from GW when it\u2019s already hard enough to be a college student during the pandemic lol\n\nIf i\u2019m not mistaken, I don\u2019t think people in isolation can go out at all unless it\u2019s for a testing or medical appointment. But I know there\u2019s a few people on here that are in isolation right now, so they can probably correct me if I\u2019m wrong and maybe share their experiences so far.",

Are they going to go home to potentially infect their family members? That's one of the troubles going back in person while the infection rate so high. Lots of students are going to have to quarantine on campus in a small room for 10 days, following DC's regulations, and hopefully there's enough staff that's not sick and quarantining themselves to help take care of you. And fingers crossed that most of the faculty will also stay well so that they can continue to teach classes. But in all ikelihood that will not be the case, you will not be well supported by staff because so many will be out sick and tons of classes are going to be canceled. Those that aren't canceled are going to put extra stress on faculty members because they are going to have to cater to in-person and virtual learning because so many students will be out sick.",

If Im paying for what GW costs I\u2019d be fucking pissed to not get to experience what is objectively the best part of the school which is it\u2019s location as well as being around friends and all the other social benefits of being on a campus. Plus the chance to get away from risking exposing my parents at home. My understanding of Covid around this age is unless you have some crazy health issues (which should certainly be accommodated for with some kind of hybrid option) is that if you\u2019re vaxxed + boosted your chances of anything bad happening are extremely low. I get some people have lower risk tolerance than others but still pretty surprised. I had a breakthrough case recently myself and it was basically just a cold I was over in a few days. Certainly not something I would want to have to deal with remote learning for. Just my opinion.\n\nEdit:\nhttps://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/645/713/888.jpg",

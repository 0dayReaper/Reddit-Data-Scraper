Anyone know anything about Guthridge room types and if it's even a freshman option? Just trying to get a better sense of what my options really are. Thanks :)",

Mitchell, thurston, Guthridge, and Potomac are all in south square and all my the ppl I\u2019ve met that live in Madison and Lafayette have had a harder time making friends",

Sometimes people will tell you things you might not want to hear. I gave you my ranking, then explained it. I dont think that\u2019s pushy at all.

Some of his publications are \"Boycotting Israel is not Free Speech\" (2016) \"Those Israel Boycotts are Illegal\" (2015) and my personal favorite title (sarcasm): \"Get Over It - Israel is the Jewish State\" (2018).",

We are working with Onero and GW as well as a few other IA orgs to put on an event on the 18th to discuss Israel/Palestine if that subject interests you, more to come soon :)",

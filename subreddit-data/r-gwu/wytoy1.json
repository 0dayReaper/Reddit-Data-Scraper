University staff conduct periodic health and safety checks of rooms to ensure things like smoke detectors aren't covered up or dead. They do not open any drawers or closets, but if something illegal or against school policy is found in plain view, they will call GWPD to come and collect it and conduct any followup investigation required.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeep your stuff in a drawer or closed container, don't cover your smoke detectors up to try and get away with smoking in your room, and 99% of the time you'll be good to go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Your friendly neighborhood GWPD Officer",

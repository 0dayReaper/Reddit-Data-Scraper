    "postText": "I\u2019ve been working with a therapist for a long time now but have been going through some serious mental health issues and need to get medication/diagnosis from a psychiatrist. I contacted the school psychiatric department but they said they aren\u2019t accepting any new patients and the woman on the phone said she knew of no other resources I could use to get the help I need. Does anyone know of any other on campus or surrounding places where I can get more help? (Something specifically for a psychiatrist, not just counseling.) Thank you!",

Additionally, you can log in on their website to find psychiatrists in their network in DC. \n\n3) GW recently got AcademicLiveCare https://healthcenter.gwu.edu/ALC for you to use 24/7, I\u2019m not sure how this works or how good the service is. \n\n4) The National Suicide Hotline number is 988, which can be called or texted for immediately help. \n\nPlease don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to me through DM if you need help too.",

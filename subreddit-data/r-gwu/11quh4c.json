I also want to know what the school\u2019s student life is as a whole and what it\u2019s like meeting new people and adjusting in the city.",

There\u2019s not another place with as many opportunities to work in IA than DC. \n\nStudents life here is very independent, everyone is generally pretty busy. There\u2019s not a unified campus environment, and you\u2019re expected to march to the beat of your own drum. I have however made many friends by going to clubs, the transfer social, and just in my classes. I\u2019ve done well but it\u2019s common to hear about students struggling to adapt.\n\nLet me know if you have anymore questions!",

Student life seems iffy, there\u2019s not rly school spirit so that community school sense isn\u2019t there but It\u2019s been really easy for me to make friends and if you like going out gw is the perfect place for it",

    "postText": "What are the best clubs and org.s to make friends (both in GW and DC) for an incoming undergrad freshman? I know this question is subjective but you get what I am trying to ask (perhaps also mentioned which clubs/org.s to avoid as well). Also any regrets of undergrad freshman year will be greatly appreciated.",

Personally I\u2019ve heard good things about cross country, fencing, and frisbee. \n\nOrgs are a bit tougher. It\u2019s easy to find one that sounds super cool and then realize they only hold a few events a year, are cliquey, or both. Personally, I would recommend Strategic Crisis Simulations (I\u2019m on the eboard so I kinda have to recommend). The best advice I have with orgs is try to go to as many events in September, then in October figure out which orgs you like most/has events you enjoy going to.",

            "comment": "Most hobby and cultural clubs are good. Business, political and professional clubs are okay as well but probably not as good on average for friends.\n\nOutside of clubs, classes are also great places. If you\u2019re looking for a very specific type of friend (i.e. a business partner friend from another field) you can email professors and ask to sit in on their classes. Smaller ones are generally better.\n\nDorms should be good as well just due to proximity but I haven\u2019t lived in them so I can only push theory on this subject.",

In the case of a graduation, once students have finished their studies and mentally moved on, a delayed graduation ceremony has much less relevance because the transition away from school has already occurred. It turns from celebrating an achievement to dwelling on the past, when there are newer and more relevant things to discuss and celebrate. In addition, once people have left the area after graduating, getting them back for a ceremony becomes a fairly tall request, as people now have jobs to take time off from and other obligations to schedule around, plus travel arrangements have to be made. School is no longer their priority, and understandably so.\n\nRescheduling a graduation would be like any other case where a milestone celebration is missed and made up later. The replacement event is, without fail, less than what the original would have been, and often feels hollow, as if people are going through the motions without any of the feeling behind it that gives the event its significance. \n\nIn other words, if the event doesn't happen when it's supposed to, the moment has been missed, and there's no way to recreate it. So the best thing to do is to just let it go.",

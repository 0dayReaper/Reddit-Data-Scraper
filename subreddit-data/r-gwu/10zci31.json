But I don't think I'll get a good score \ud83d\ude05 I thought GREs were phased out post-Covid. Is it too late to reasonably get in? 3.5 GPA at undergrad at university of Oklahoma. Wanting to go into political science...I have two campaign experiences as part of my resume.",

Personally, I'm from Oklahoma and did my undergrad at OU, so I want to branch out. I think I'm going to opt out of applying to GWU and instead just apply to AU and GMU (mostly due to not requiring a GRE). If I get denied I think I'll probably take a gap semester and focus on the GRE (and also applying earlier)",

    "postText": "I am an upcoming second year female planning to lease a townhouse with another second year male, two bedroom 1.5 bath for only 2,385 a month. we would rent the unit for 9 months, making the total rent only 8,000 for the entire school year which is significantly lower than what you pay for gw housing!!!! it is only 2 blocks away from campus, close to the whole foods. our 3rd roomate just backed out and we\u2019re looking for a new one. depending on your gender or just personal preference, two of us would share the master bedroom (with two separate beds) and one person would have the smaller room to themselves. Less than $800 a month!!! we are social people and will be respectful of your space. Respond to this if you\u2019re interested!!!!",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm a female Asian high school senior applying for an early decision scholarship and one of the schools I can choose from is GW. \n\nI want to attend a school with good student life, and I personally don't care about football games and nightlife. Concerts, church groups, karaoke, and food are more of my interests. I'm personally not too involved with politics, but I respect people who are.\n\nI plan on majoring in psychology (BA) and perhaps the combined art therapy program. Can anyone share their experiences on these subjects? Also interested in occupational therapy after college if anyone's heard of that.\n\nI'm taking Dual Enrollment courses at local colleges in Georgia; will these credits be transferable?\n\nAre the psych classes hard, and are professors willing to help you? Are there free tutoring services too?\n\nIs the environment competitive even for psych majors? And overall, is there more grade inflation or deflation? (Applying to OT grad school)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to help an indecisive high schooler out haha",

I don\u2019t know how is it in Psychology, but GWU doesn\u2019t have a particularly strong student life, but being a Urban School you have greater options for stuff going on in the city itself. It\u2019s a very expensive city tho, have that in mind.",

I\u2019d call admissions to be sure, though. \n\nI found the classroom environment to be very supportive and there were opportunities to do research, which was great for grad school. \n\nThe one thing I\u2019d say is that GW is expensive for a major like psychology. If you\u2019re going to take out loans I\u2019d look for something cheaper.",

But that is ultimately your decision. \n\nNightlife at GW is not really focused around sports or greek life, but there is definitely a big clubbing/partying culture. \n\nInterest wise, a majority of people are there for political reasons. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t find friend groups with similar interests, they will just be a lot more limited opportunities. Especially for religious groups, I would say they are in the extreme minority of participation and interest when looking at the uni from a macro level. They definitely do exist, more so the Jewish community orgs, but there are Muslim and Catholic groups. \n\nAs for psychology, the program is very basic and is definitely not one that is a priority for funding. Gw actually had a problematic history with their psychology and medical psychiatry programs as GW was a hotspot for lobotomies. I\u2019ve had many professors in adjacent fields speak about this and show general distaste in how the university has lacked any sort of apology or recognition of this. \n\nI looked at the gw combined ba/ma art therapy website and it seems like a good opportunity if you are sure you want to be a professional in this field. My only thing is that you would have to wait until your 4/5th year to actually take art therapy courses. \n\nOverall I think you could find your niche at GW, but I wouldn\u2019t doubt there are other schools that might be a better fit for you.",

The acceptance rate for applying ED is generally higher, but since it's a \"binding\" commitment, you will be less likely to receive merit-based aid and won't have the opportunity to compare post-aid prices with other schools. GW is a great school if you can attend at the right price, but ED is generally not a good option for most people.",

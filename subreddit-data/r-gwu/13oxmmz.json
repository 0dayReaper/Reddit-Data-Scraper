A lot of GW students go to Sign of the Whale, Decades, and Ultrabar on the weekends if clubs and bars are your thing. Take advantage of the free museums. My favorite place in the city is the National Zoo.",

And during the day, the Wharf is pretty spectacular (a friend of mine and I are going there today actually). DM me if you have questions.",

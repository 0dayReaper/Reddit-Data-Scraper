Christian pretends to get signatures for other candidates w out their knowledge and left the names blank and then put his name in instead. JEC disqualified him, and he calls them numnuts both in email and person. Testimony at meeting said that he said that the senators deserved it. The JEC meeting got zoombombed w explicit content.\nElection moved for god knows why.\n\nBut also recently its gotten serious because student life has been reaching out to students asking if they're okay because of things said within election but most people emailed have no idea what they're talking about. \n\nChristian keeps acting like the populist leader he is and he\u2019s untouchable while others hate working for him or with him, so many of his cabinet members have resigned he\u2019s had to start hiring freshmen for everything and even they have started quitting",

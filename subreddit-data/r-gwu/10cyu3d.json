    "postText": "im an IA major looking to double major in either international business or finance. i\u2019ve always leaned more towards liberal arts and have no experience in either besides what i know from taking econ. i was hoping to gain more hard skills from a second major since it\u2019s hard to work in IA out of undergrad, and i\u2019d prefer a job that has opportunity to travel.\n\ni was wondering if anyone has done IA and IB or IA and finance who could give me some insight? and would finance be impossible for someone with no background in it?",

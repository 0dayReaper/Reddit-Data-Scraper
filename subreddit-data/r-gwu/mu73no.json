It sounds like they\u2019re only accepting the ones approved by American agencies but I know from personal experience you can\u2019t find them in some places. When I was in Belarus it was abundantly clear you were getting Sputnik or nothing at all.\n\nI presume, unfortunately, this will cause problems for students in other parts of the world as well. It\u2019s not a matter of not *wanting* Pfizer/Moderna, the governments just refuse to import them.",

Vaccinations are really slow in my country, so its incredibly unlikley that Ill be vaccinated here. I think what most internationals are gonna have to do is arrive before and get vaccinated in the US. I know there are some states that dont require proof of citzienship or residency to be vaccinated now (Ive heard this applies to maryland?), so I think thats the path that most internationals are going to go down.",

It\u2019s why a family can still be charged with neglect if a child dies and hasn\u2019t been taken to the doctor. It\u2019s why FGM is illegal in America despite being a religious practice for some. \nSure, calling all religions fake was probably not a super eloquent way to go about it, but the point still stands that, in terms of public health, religious objection isn\u2019t a good reason not to get a vaccine and the university allowing religious vaccine exception puts the GW community at risk because it allows for unvaccinated people, who could have been vaccinated but chose not to, to spread covid, disrupt the school year, and potentially cost lives or livelihood. \nHonestly the only exception should be allergies (anaphylaxis don\u2019t play) or other legitimate health concern as approved by a doctor. They should also consider accepting vaccines that are approved in other countries but not the US or allow international students to be vaccinated on arrival - but that\u2019s another issue entirely",

Up to 75% of adults in the United States self-identify as some kind of Christian (https://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/) and Hillel claims 24% of the undergraduate population identifies as Jewish (https://www.hillel.org/college-guide/list/record/george-washington-university) \nThat\u2019s not to say that 99% of the student population Is religious - I haven\u2019t even taken the third major world religion , Islam, into account as numbers were much harder to find, but it IS enough to draw the conclusion that a majority of students could potentially qualify for the exception. And really to mess up heard immunity it only takes 10-20%.   \n\nTesting, quarantining, and mask wearing isn\u2019t enough in any case as mutations predominantly occur in unvaccinated populations (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2777785)\n\nBasically, the more unvaccinated individuals exist in a community the more chances you have for mutations which put the entire population at risk . \n\nAlso, on what cases or relevant laws are you basing your assumption that a lack of religious exception to vaccination could lead to a lawsuit?",

However, associating a lack of religious exception to the vaccine as \u201cbigotry\u201d adds fuel to the anti vaccine fire and gives a leg-less argument another point. Now they aren\u2019t just subject to a rule just like everyone else, but instead are being denied an exception to the rule based on their religion.

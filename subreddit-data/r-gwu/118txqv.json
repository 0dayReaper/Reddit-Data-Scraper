    "postText": "so it\u2019s my first semester here as i was a spring admit, before this i did a semester of community college. during that semester, i would go to bed at 10:30 and wake up at 7:30 every day. but since being here, my sleep schedule has totally changed? now even if i try i can\u2019t fall asleep before 1 am and i would say about twice a week i end up not being able to fall asleep at all - sometimes crashing around 7 am and sleeping the whole day instead. has anyone else had this problem?",

Like melatonin is super helpful but in my experience taking more than 10 a night harms sleep patterns more than it helps, and honestly five is probably best.\n\nif you're in a freshman dorm the heaters are probably running crazy hot which also hurts sleeping. I remember my dorm would always be in the eighties until like end of march",

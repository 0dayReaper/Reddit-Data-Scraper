In any of the north lounges (excluding the penthouse), there is an HDMI jack under the TV. Assuming that you're on GWireless and that your gaming system has an HDMI output, you can use an HDMI cable to plug into the wall, go to the touch panel on the lower left side of the TV, turn the system on by touching the control panel, select the wall plate input (it might be called \"wall plate\" or \"Aux\", I can't recall at the moment) and it should come right up. You can also use the control panel to ramp the volume up and down. I hope this helps - Dave",

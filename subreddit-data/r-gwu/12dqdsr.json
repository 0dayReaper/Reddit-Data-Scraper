While I may disagree with his viewpoints I still think that he may have important things to say, as in how to become a Supreme Court justice. I also somewhat agree with the concept introduced by John Stuart Mill that offense speech (not all of course but more of things that people generally disagree with ex:overturn of roe v Wade) should be allowed as it allows people to remember not only why it\u2019s offense but also gives the opportunity to show others (who may be incorrect) their viewpoint.",

Then we would have 0 speakers, there\u2019s always a chance a psycho causes physical violence with any speaker. Don\u2019t let violent people win, that\u2019s what they want. The speaker is not the one at fault who should pay, the psycho threatening physical violence over discourse is. This also just sounds like a great way to shut down speakers the school doesn\u2019t like. I know it\u2019s a well intentioned thought it just would go extremely poorly and be abused, just like most well intentioned ideas. Saying this not in reference to Thomas just general think about all the topics that would be off the table just cus a few wackos RARELY cause an issue- Israel/Palestine, abortion, war, etc etc\n\nYou will never eliminate risk and have an institution that is worth it\u2019s salt at the same time",

It would be so easy for anyone to be swiped in by someone else and shoot up the place. The risk of being around him for two hours a day outweighs whatever I would learn from him. I wouldn't attend an event with Richard Spencer either for that same reason. Other speakers simply are less controversial and don't carry that level of risk.",

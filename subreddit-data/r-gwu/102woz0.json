Any major/school/department. Also - who are the best/most interesting professors at GW? Again, any field. I am doing a project where I interview GW profs and I would love to know who are the most interesting/accomplished/best teachers, that's why I am asking. Thank you!",

            "comment": "I haven\u2019t had many *famous* profs, though some of them have won various teaching awards and are pretty well known in their respective fields. Anyway: Best profs I\u2019ve had by department: \n\nIA: Michael Brown (teaches intro to IA, very well known in the field, has won all the teaching awards there are to win and everyone in elliott knows his name) \n\nEcon: Steve Surranovic (and Jay Shambaugh who\u2019s now at Treasury). Steve runs the global bachelors program and mostly teaches intro or grad classes. If you\u2019re lucky enough to get a seminar with him, he\u2019s a hidden gem. Before shambaugh left he was a hidden gem, but Biden realized as much and whisked him away \n\nAnth: Alexander Dent, anth department chair, super cool guy. Ask him about how his dad answers the phone \n\nFrench: Calie Rerodo (now at the world bank). Goat French professor\n\nHistory: Steven Brady. Not much to say. Great prof and even cooler guy\n\nPolisci: Stephen Kaplan. Started every class off with a different 80s jam. Enough said\n\nFinance: Brian Henderson. I just took his Financial Derivatives class. Hardest class I\u2019ve taken at GW and the first class I haven\u2019t gotten an A in. Also the most rewarding class I\u2019ve taken in the last 4 years, he built it from the ground up and really cares about his students \n\nWorst instructor but funniest and most interesting guy: John Volpe (\u201cI have tenure so they can only fire me if I steal money or assault someone\u201d) \n\nHonorable mention to GTAs Jowel Choufani and Nick Luettke for being two of the best TAs on campus",

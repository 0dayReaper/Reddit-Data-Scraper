    "postText": "Long story short, I missed a class for CCAS research presentation days and it dropped my grade to the next letter grade. The professor doesn\u2019t grant excused absences - all are unexcused even with documentation/university events. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if I could fight this with the university or if it\u2019s even worth it? Without this affecting my grade I have completed every assignment on time and one EC assignment.",

            "comment": "I originally typed something long out but realized your absence was b/c of the presentation day(s). That certainly changes things.\n\nI would nonetheless talk to the professor - preferably in person, in office - and explain the situation. Make sure they know that you missed not because of oversleeping, but because of another academic commitment. See if there's any extra credit that can be done to restore the grade; otherwise, see if they'll budge on the fact this was technically a \"university event.\"\n\nIf he still doesn't budge, honestly, I would approach the Dean at that point. I've heard of bumping down / up half letter grades, but never a full letter grade - that's absurd. I think what the other comments are missing is that you missed because of a university event.",

Go up the chain of command TA \u2014&gt; prof \u2014&gt; chair.\n\nAs a note, did you tell them this before the presentation? If so, have documentation of that. A lot of profs really stick to the \u201cyou have to let me know BEFOREHAND\u201d as a reason.",

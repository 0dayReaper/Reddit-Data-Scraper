    "postText": "Okay so I'm an incoming freshman looking to do a B.S. in econ with a sustainability (or maybe GIS?) minor. I wanted to take ECON 1011 with Suranovic since I hear he's the best for that class but his only available timeslot conflicts with GEOG 1002 which covers a GPAC science requirement and is a part of both minors I'm considering (it also sounds more interesting to me than other science lab courses). Should I opt for a different science class in order to have a better chance with Suranovic or do I suck it up and deal with Mackay for econ so I can take the geography class?",

A lot of people here hate him for some reason but honestly hes very accessible out of class, the TA's are incredible and he always tries to relate material back to real-world situations, which i found very cool. I'd recommend him, but to each their own",

His lectures are very clear and straightforward, and he would only test what he went over in class. He does not read off the slides but instead write notes and do problems on paper. He also go through homework problems step by step. \n\nPlus, TA even makes detailed study guides for every exam and compiles all related problems.\n\nI would say give it a try!",

I've heard such mixed stuff about Mackay and I know it wouldn't be the end of the world to have econ with him, thank you for reassuring that :). I think what I'm going to do is try my best to get econ with Suranovic and just take the geography course another time, but if that doesn't work out I will go with Mackay and do the geography too. Thank you!",

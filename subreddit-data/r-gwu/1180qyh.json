    "postText": "Hello, I am an international student that recently got an opportunity to attend GWU. I would have a full external scholarship covering all direct expenses, but I am very scared about how I would fit in there as I can see that everyone is super rich and pretentious. My family's reserves are very limited, so everything I would be able to spend there is what I could earn through on-campus employment. My other option is to go to a small liberal arts school where I already have some friends. Any thoughts on this? I am super lost, I really like everything about GWU except for what I can read about the community online. TBH I am very anticapitalist so I don't know whether this school fits my mindset.",

Not everyone is rich and pretentious at GW, rest assured. \n\nSounds like the full ride (which I\u2019m sure your family appreciates) plus a new environment where you will need to adapt and make new/different friends could be very empowering for you. \n\nWhere do you think you will be most challenged? What school has a better network to plug you into things you will want to do for work/make a living? Where do you think you can best grow and evolve as a person?",

I honestly have not met anyone I would consider pretentious after four years here. Congrats and I look forward to seeing you on campus :)",

I mean food is the best example. There is always a challenge for students here to eat solely off their dining plan. I know every year I was on gworld I ended up having spending my own money on food a lot. Also it\u2019s college in a big city people do a lot of things that are way over priced for fun. Clubs, bars, concerts etc. That being said GW does have a place for most everyone and I never found fitting in particularly difficult.",

I am actually transferring because although I have met a few great people here, the majority of the population are entitled brats and will make you feel horrible about yourself if you\u2019re slightly different from them in any way. The foreign exchange students I know hate it, but for some the amount of money they received from the school outweighs how bad the school really is. For me, I did not get enough money from them to call gwu anything other than a scam.",

Rich pricks do exist here but they are few and far between compared to the stereotypes about this university. As for anti-capitalism, that element definetly does exist on this campus (the trotskyist outside district house comes to mind) and within DC in general.",

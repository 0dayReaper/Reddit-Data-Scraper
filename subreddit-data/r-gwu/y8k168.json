    "postText": "Im a CS freshman and I need to pick which science class I am going to take next semester. My options are Physics1, Chemistry1, and Biology1. I am required to take 3 classes total but I need to take the 1st and 2nd course for 2 of the 3 credits (Example: Physics1, Physics2, Biology1) or (Biology1, Biology2, Physics1)\n\nWhat are the easiest classes I can take?",

Chem 1 besson is amazing as was chem 2 cahill. Bio 1 and 2 are a lot of memorizing, but the material isn\u2019t hard to understand. I can\u2019t speak to the professors at GW for bio though",

    "postText": "So I looked over my degreemap and it turns out that even though I will have completed all my degree requirements this year to graduate, I actually have 3 credits left over and I\u2019d like to use them up this semester while I\u2019m paying full time (next semester I\u2019m taking 9 credits but if I add this elective it\u2019ll be full time tuition, so I\u2019d rather use them up this semester while I can still take 3).\n\nDoes anybody know any super lax electives that I can take to fill them up? I have 15 credits currently this semester and I don\u2019t want to add a lot of stress if I\u2019m gonna make it 18. I\u2019m down for literally any class that\u2019s kind of a throwaway.",

There is only a detailed curriculum that lists all the courses.  \n\nCan someone please help me understand what falls under this focus area? Are the courses different? Where can I find more details of the courses?",

I would recommend giving him an email (you'll find him if you google the name). He can be tricky to get in touch with, but I had him for cognitive neuroscience classes and he is one of the top experts in the world on this stuff.",

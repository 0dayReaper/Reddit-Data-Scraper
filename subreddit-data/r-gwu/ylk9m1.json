    "postText": "Next semester I'll be taking  ECE 6005 Computer Architecture and Design at GW as part of their Cloud Computing Management Masters. Does any one have any insight into this course. I'll be honest, based on the book provided in the syllabus, I'll a little worried I may not be up to snuff. It's mostly the base 2/16 conversions and what not. I haven't even began to read into Boolean Algebra, Digital Logic, and Logic Gates. Any help would be great. Thank you.",

                            "comment": "Ok. So this course assumes you\u2019ve taken an undergrad computer architecture course or at least know the material. You definitely need to know the basics of how a computer operates at the instruction level (load an instruction from memory, decode it, execute it, etc. etc.) and the various parts that make up a barebones computer (registers, ALU, memory and how it\u2019s addressed, etc.). This course (like pretty much every computer architecture course ever) uses the MIPS instruction set for everything and it\u2019s assumed you learned that in previous courses, so become familiar with it and the standard 5 stage pipeline. If you have never taken a computer architecture course, I would highly recommend doing a short one on e.g. Khan Academy, Coursera, MIT OpenCourseWare, whatever.\n\nAs for the rest of the stuff. Base conversions are absolutely essential, you\u2019ll need to be able to do those without a calculator. *Technically* digital logic is a prerequisite to the prerequisite, realistically this course doesn\u2019t go into the level where you\u2019d need to know how to wire together logic gates or anything. Be familiar with some of the basic concepts, that should be enough. Best of luck\u2026",

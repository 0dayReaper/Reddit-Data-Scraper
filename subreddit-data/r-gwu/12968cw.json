Money is not a problem in this situation, and I received no financial aid from either school.\n\nGW Pros:\n-in the city, I grew up in the country my whole life \n-very diverse! \n-easy access to network and gain internships! \n\nGW Cons:\n-I hear that it\u2019s hard to make friends at GW because of the campus\n-lacks schools spirit\n-expensive city in general (I\u2019d like to save SOME money) \n\nDoes anyone have any advice or can vouch from experience about their time at GW studying IR? Thanks!",

Imo its much more worth it than William and Mary, but if you want to look at the rankings (debatable on how well they actually represent programs), GW is leagues better than William and Mary. DC is an expensive city, but imo its not hard to make friends at all. It all depends on the person though",

            "comment": "William &amp; Mary and GW both have their own strengths but I\u2019d personally go with GW. I\u2019d say that William &amp; Mary is generally considered a \u201cbetter\u201d school overall, but GW definitely has the better IA program. If you're more committed to a career in IA than the college experience, GW dedicates a lot of resources to the IA program and offers more areas of specialization to pursue your interests.\n\nGW's IA program benefits from the resources of an entire school dedicated to this one major, and offers students the opportunity to take courses from any other school/department to explore a specialization. The Elliott School also regularly hosts a lot of events and speakers, and many of the professors are current professionals in the field. On the other hand, at more rural schools like W&amp;M, I would guess the professors are mostly tenured researchers, rather than people who currently work in the State Department, World Bank, etc. \n\nElliott wasn\u2019t accidentally placed right next door to the state department and world bank, so definitely take the opportunity to go there if you really see yourself going down that route. Also, tons of W&amp;M students come to DC every summer for internships anyways, so you will unlock another level of opportunity by being in DC year round. \n\nIf school culture and community are important more you, W&amp;M may provide a more traditional college experience. From what I\u2019ve seen Greek life is a big part of the experience at W&amp;M, while at GW it's generally unimportant and more professional-based. Ultimately, it depends on what you value more, but either way they are both really great options.",

I genuinely believe you will regret it if you don\u2019t commit to GW, and this is coming from someone trying their goddamn best to transfer from GW because of the cost. Also I literally applied to transfer to william and mary. Go to GW. If you\u2019re really into IA there\u2019s going to be tons of people who share your interests. There aren\u2019t many genuine people anywhere you go, but GW has more people to choose from, and you\u2019re more likely to make friends in DC than in Williamsburg!",

    "postText": "I'm an intl student applied to IR of GWU for EDI. I was really confident with my essays, activities, gpa; my contri per year is 36k. I really really like GWU so I was shocked when I got a rejection from the school.\n\nWhat am i supposed to do know? Should I email to the admission counsellor and ask why I got rejected or ask them for an interview so that they can reconsider me?\n\nI know all stuffs above sound stupid but I'm totally collapsed. I just want to know if i have any possibility to get in.",

            "comment": "Rejection sucks, but it\u2019s part of life and college admissions is usually the first time people experience it. It\u2019s crushing and terrible, but you will be stronger on the other end of this. \n\nThere is honestly not much you can do being rejected, as if they believed you would have a chance at regular admission they would have deferred you. \n\nGetting into your dream school is obviously a great feeling, but more people get rejected from their dream school than accepted. I was rejected from my top school, but after I got other acceptances later, I realized that I liked aspects of the other schools better and if I did get in I probably wouldn\u2019t have been in insurmountable debt (hey NYU!!)\n\nTry to treat yourself this weekend, because your hard work is not negated by a rejection and deserves to be celebrated. Get your favorite meal or go shopping. \n\nWhere else are you applying to?",

You can also ask them if they consider spring acceptance. Or you can go to college in your country first then maybe apply for transfer. I hope this helps !!",

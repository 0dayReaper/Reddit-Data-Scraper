    "postText": "The community has grown quite a lot since we last got new mods and looks like people are interested in either applying to be mods or would like more mod generated content. I am looking for at least 5 additional mods. It can get pretty busy during the school year, so we'll need a good number to help manage the influx of posts as well as making sure no one feels to overwhelmed.\n\nIn order to be eligible for applying, you will need to be either an alum from the last 5 years and in the DMV area or a currently enrolled student. If you are interested in applying, you can message either me or the mod queue directly with answers to the questions listed below. Responses are due by July 11th. I hope to choose the new mods by August 1st. \n\n1. First name, current status (alum or current student and grad year), and GW userID/netID to verify eligibility. I still work at GW so I am able to verify this information\n2. Why would you like to be a moderator for this community?\n3. What kind of regular mod generated content do you think we need more of?\n4. What are your suggestion for improving the community?\n5. What is your favorite memory of GW?",

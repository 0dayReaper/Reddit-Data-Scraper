Always clean, one of the absolute best-located dorms on campus, and it\u2019s small enough that you can make friends with your floor and it\u2019s typically pretty quiet.\n\nETA: like another commenter said West is really nice too and living there probably gives you the most classic/typical college experience your first year, which can be hard to find other places at GW.  so that\u2019s something to keep in mind if you decide you wouldn\u2019t mind the Vern!",

            "comment": "Best to worst\nTo start off, GW has some of the best dorms in the country. My dorm is so much nicer than all of my friends at other elite private schools.\n\n1. Potomac: Newest dorm and nicest by far. Bathrooms are suite style and rooms are medium sized for Gw. Best location being close to Thurston, party dorm, but not in it. Carvings late night food and the package pickup for the whole campus are in Potomac.\n\n2. Madison: private bathrooms, older, biggest rooms.\n\n3. Lafayette: older, but not as old as madison. Suite style. Like Potomac, just way older. Rooms are smaller than Madison by a large margin.\n\n4. Thurston: Tiny rooms but renovated and beautiful. Semi communal bathrooms meaning that each \u201cbathroom pod\u201d has a sink, toilet, shower, and it\u2019s own locked door. Kitchens and common spaces are beautiful.\n\n5. District: mostly affinity housing that is very nice but not worth the extra 3500 per year in my opinion. \n\n6. Mitchell: singles, old, communal bathrooms\n\n7. West Hall: nicest dorm overall, but on the Vern and removed from the city which houses most classes and nightlife. Free Lyfts back from foggy to the Vern at night hours.\n\n8. Any other Vern hall",

Only con is that district is the most expensive freshman house (roughly 14.5k/yr) where others are around ~10-11k\n\nDepends on what caters to you, check the room tours via online and shoot me a dm if you need additional help",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, I recently received an Admit for MS in CS at GWU for Fall 2023 and they are offering a 25% Scholarship every semester(provided a good academic standing, 3.0 and above). I have received other offers from RIT, Syracuse, NJIT, UTA(Arlington), DePaul, and George Mason(EXPENSIVE).   \nI wanted to know your thoughts on GWU in general and also on:  \n\n\n1. Thesis/Research Opportunities(Not for Ph.D. but Master's Thesis)\n2. On-Campus Jobs for the initial months.\n3. Coursework(Best and worst in your exp)\n4. Faculty names that usually look for Students to assist/work on their projects.\n\nNOTE: I am an international student so I have to take 9 Credits/ Semester to maintain my Full-time Status.",

            "comment": "GW is a good school, and through my time there and shortly after I left, it has been getting better. Academics wise, it is very strong in the social sciences and has very well respected professors who are often genuine professionals in their fields. Over the past decade they have really tried to grow their STEM programs, but they are still not comparable to other schools by any means. I wouldn\u2019t suggest going to GW for health sciences over other schools, because GW just doesn\u2019t have the same level of prestige in that field compared to other universities. You will likely find nothing special doing health sciences or STEM at GW that you wouldn\u2019t find at other schools in the same caliber. \n\nSocially, the school is not for everyone, certainly not for me. A vast majority of the student body comes from wealthy families who are the quintessential virtue signalers. One second they will be ranting about the injustices they face, and the next they are flying to their ski lodge or lake house. This was super grating to me, and it made me hate going to GW. But, for many people, they find their niche at GW and have a great time, I just wasn\u2019t one of those people. \n\nIf you are wise, you can get a lot out of going to GW, especially through its proximity to so many job and internship opportunities. However, I\u2019m not really sure how many opportunities there are in the health sector in DC compared to cities like Boston. \n\nIf you go to GW, you can find ways to enjoy it and even love it, but I definitely wouldn\u2019t ever buy into the picture GW tries to paint for prospective applicants. Visit it yourself, and only go if it\u2019s worth it financially.",

So many top notch internships and connections are available to you. The public health program is also one of the best in the nation, and probably THE best on policy and social sciences. The professors in public health are amazing and incredibly knowledgeable. STEM isn\u2019t bad but there are definitely better schools. Depends on where you get into. If you want to come for social sciences in the health professions you can\u2019t beat it. \n\nhope this helps!",

It\u2019s a fundamental course, so if you don\u2019t have an excellent grasp of it anything you build off of it won\u2019t be as solid. \n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is that you shouldn\u2019t go into discrete 2 with the assumption that you\u2019ll do better, so you optimally start with close to an A.",

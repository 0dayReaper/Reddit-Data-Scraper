He was disqualified for doing this.   \n\\- At a student organization fundraising event, he bid to go on a date with an 18 year old student, despite being 25.  \n\\- He stole credit for the Plan B machine from the two girls who worked on it. They were all invited to the White House, but Christian went by himself and didn\u2019t inform the two women that they were invited as well.   \n\\- The president encouraged his followers to send threatening messages to senators over a minor agenda disagreement. One of the JEC testimonies said that Christian said the senators deserved the death threats for disagreeing with him.   \n\\- He faced serious allegations during a senate meeting. In response, he made an Instagram post generated by ChatGPT, which barely address the accusations. The writing style of the post does not match his public documents and previous writing style.   \n\\- Zidouemba posted a message supposedly from Senator Dan Saleem, which contained a racist message. He then attacked Saleem for making racist remarks, but it was later proven that the message Christian posted was a poorly executed photoshop attempt.  \n\\- In a last-minute attempt to salvage his reputation, Zidouemba resorted to insulting everyone on Instagram with populist Donald Trump tactics",

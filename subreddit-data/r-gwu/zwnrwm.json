It\u2019s been more than 8 days and I Have no grade for my final and other assignment as well. \n\nWould it be reasonable to email the department chair? What should I do? Many students depend on their grades for internship applications/scholarship retention/etc so I feel that this is a big deal and I should have a final grade for this course by now.",

Lol\n\nYour scholarship will not be affected by a missing grade.\n\nAlso like the other comment said, just submit what you have for your transcript. You should get one the same day you make the request. If a job sees no grade for a class, they\u2019ll assume the grade isn\u2019t in yet not that you failed or audited etc. there\u2019s a legend for a reason",

    "postText": "I am an international student. Today I received a decision on my application for an MS in Geography program at CCAS. They accepted my application and even awarded me $20k. This is the first time I am applying for anything similar !!\n\nBut this joy is slowly evaporating as I research more and more on tuition fees and living costs. Even after the huge award I still need to pay \\~$40k in 2 years !! \n\nI wrote back for a definitive cost chart. I can hardly manage half, otherwise ... \n\nHow are you managing?",

If I was looking at full/partial self-funding, I'd much rather be at a different school. I don't have any info about the Geography program - is it a good department? Are your prospects for jobs post-MS good enough to justify the cost? If not I'd look elsewhere for the degree.",

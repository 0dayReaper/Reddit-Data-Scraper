Most students at GW are the typical \u201chonors college\u201d student. It\u2019s full of passionate and hardworking people, and you can find your niche wherever as long as you put in the effort. \n\nFor me, the inflexibility of the honors program takes away some of the benefits I experienced at college. I was able to explore a few different courses unrelated to my major and unlock new interests that I wouldn\u2019t have been able to follow through with if I was in the honors program. \n\nThe \u201cbenefit\u201d of registering early and being in smaller classes (in topics I didn\u2019t care about) didn\u2019t make sense for me. However, if you feel like the honors program would enhance your learning experience, I say go for it. For me, I was looking to get in and out as fast as possible so I could get a job in something I loved, I just needed the degree. It would probably be worth it if you were go to onto a research-oriented masters or PhD program",

But I'm primarily trying to get out of the science requirement since I have AP credit for it, but honors doesn't count it. And I'd like to focus on fulfilling prereqs and figuring out my school during my first year, as I'm not sure if I'd like to transfer to GWSB or do a double major with IA and Business, which would mean I need room for extra courses. Plus, if I drop the UHP, why go through the 2 science and extra philosophy course? Sorry for the long answer, I'm just frustrated that I can't get out of the science requirement despite AP Biology.",

If you're in CCAS, the honors science class fulfills an oral requirement. If you're in Elliott/GWSB, idk much about that. I stayed in the UHP just to keep early registration and since I have to do a thesis with my department anyway. Some of the honors courses also overlapped with my major requirements so that was a plus. Overall, the requirements suck but the small classes might be nice? One of my honors profs offered to write me a rec letter, which would've never happened in a large lecture class.",

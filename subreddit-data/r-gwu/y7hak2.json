I feel like nobody is going to stop us from knocking on an embassy door\u2026$40 just seems like too much money for me to be spending on trick-or-treating when I could walk around for free",

There are some nicely decorated houses up there too so its just nice to walk around. Plus its usually busy with people so it's easier to tell who has candy.",

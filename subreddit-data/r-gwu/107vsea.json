During the week, I'm usually up around 8 every day, go to work or class, grab coffee after &amp; have a snack on the go if I can't stop by my dorm. Go to the rest of my classes (with a short lunch in-between), visit the gym, go to club meetings, have dinner, spend some time at library or in dorm doing homework and bed by 11:30 the latest. Weekends are more for self-care and friends with a touch of homework.",

Both orgs should also have an internships/careers bulletin with offices hiring, I got two hilternships freshman year without even needing to apply because networking with upperclassmen and alunmae just got me in the door",

But please do not actually go to the office in person and asking. It\u2019s a waste of your time and the staff assistant at the front desk will not be impressed. They might be slightly uncomfortable, in fact, because that is just so uncommon and doesn\u2019t align with what their internship hiring process is like.",

It might be a crap shoot but I\u2019ve made connections by literally just walking the halls of Rayburn, it really doesn\u2019t hurt IMO to get that experience putting yourself out there (and maybe even embarassing yourself)",

And be persistent, I got my 1st Hill internship because I messaged the office one a month asking for an update. \n\nBIG NOTE, if you are a Dem or a Rep DO NOT INTERN FOR THE OTHER SIDE, it will make life hard finding a political job if you intern for the other side. If you are from a Red district and are a Dem, find the closest blue one you can, apply to any district you have a  connection to. visit family for the holidays in NJ when you're from VA, apply to NJ too.",

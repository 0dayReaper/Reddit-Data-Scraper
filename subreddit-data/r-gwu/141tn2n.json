    "postText": "Question for anyone who used interstate storage this year.\n\nI still haven\u2019t received a confirmation that my items have been picked up, nor have i recieved an invoice yet. I sent them an email about two weeks ago asking for confirmation, and they just told me i\u2019d receive it \u201csoon.\u201d\n\nThis could just be me being anxious, but are other people still waiting on them? \n\nAlso, side question, any idea what housing would do with my stuff if, say, interstate forgot to pick it up?",

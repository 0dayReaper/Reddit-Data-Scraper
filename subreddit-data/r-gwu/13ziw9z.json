            "comment": "That's subjective. What is \"worth it\" to one person isn't for another. For our family, we have decided to send our daughter to GW despite the fact that she didn't get a single dollar in FinAid or merit. She is extremely lucky that she won't have to go into debt to attend. For us it's worth it because she was consindering colleges only in DC and NYC. She's a city person and couldn't imagine going to a suburban or rual college. The program she's chosen isn't available at all colleges, and GW has a really great program. Her sister lives in DC already. Since her sister has an established residence in DC, my daughter was granted the appeal to live off campus. So she will get to be roommates with her sister. She has several friends already at GW and a few will be joining her in the fall as well. So for us, it was our best option.",

            "comment": "It depends on what you want out of your experience. If you want connections, networking, a terrific education, and a DC experience, yes, GW is so worth it. If you want community, a classic college campus, and a low price point, then GW isn\u2019t the place for you. Trust your gut.",

I felt like I had a \u201ctrue\u201d college experience (football games, college town vibes, huge campus with lots of opportunities and majors, great sports and close to other big cities). However the grad program I wanted to do is only offered at four universities (GW,NYU, UPenn, UBoston, and Emory). I applied to all of them and got in, but GW gave the most financial aid. I haven\u2019t started yet but I\u2019m excited for a change in scenery and GW will give me everything I need for this time of life. \n\nThink about how you picture your college experience and pick what you want to do.",

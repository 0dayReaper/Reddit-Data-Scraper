Especially since you are bound to attend either way, they will probably give you less aid than others applying RD. If you are truly worried, maybe see if you can transfer your application to RD.",

In my experience, however, you can squeeze a little more out of them by filing a financial aid appeal as early as possible. You may also qualify for merit aid, which can make a good dent depending on how much you get.",

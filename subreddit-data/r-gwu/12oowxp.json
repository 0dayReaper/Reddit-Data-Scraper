    "postText": "I am trying to decide between GW and McGill (they pretty much cost the same). I like both schools a lot, however, GW is not particularly known for its STEM department (I will be majoring in biology) which I\u2019m a little concerned about. Are the science professors good and are classes manageable? Also, does anyone know how the social life at GW might compare to McGill? Thanks!\n\nEdit: I will be majoring in biology on the pre-med track",

McGill is extremely revered on an international scale and if you plan on working in other countries it will give you an edge GW will not. The academics are also challenging off the bat. I will just tell you as someone who went to UBC and brother at U of T for sciences, first year science is VERY intense in Canada. If you did not take full IB or AP level of ALL science classes (bio, physics, chem), there will be a gap between first year science in Canada and US high school science (even honors). Another aspect is financial. Any way you slice it GW will be pricier, whether you are Canadian or not. Housing in MTL is also cheaper than Dc in general. Happy to answer further questions",

I don\u2019t want to go to a school that\u2019s so rigorous that I don\u2019t have time for other things.

I can tell you the course load is much harder and taking summer classes in Canada is extremely common to graduate in 4 years if you don\u2019t have AP\u2019s or IB\u2019s. I can tell you it\u2019s much easier in America than in Canada for classes, especially first year classes. As some Canadian schools for instance like Waterloo and UBC have almost a 50% drop out rate for engineering and sciences aren\u2019t far off that. So if you are interested in BME at GWU I think its a great option but, it\u2019s definitely much harder than Biology. However, being in SEAS at GWU gives you a lot more options for research with professors as an undergrad than CCAS as CCAS is very disorganized. I hope this helps in your decision.",

Classes are manageable but most professors are a little disconnected from their students; you will also be taking required chem classes, and the chem department here is absolute shit. The teachers are horrible and usually their lectures contradict the textbook. Labs are lovely, however. The TAs are always a delight. If you are looking into general biology and will be focusing on ecology, evolution, environment, etc, you are in good hands. I found that the profs in that Bio department to be nicer, better teachers, and charismatic. \n\nUnfortunately, there are not a lot of internship options in the immediate area if you are looking for field experience since we are surrounded by federal and state buildings. If you are able to travel, Virginia and Maryland have a great deal of Bio jobs and internships. \n\nHowever, I want to point out that GWU is known predominately for IA. I don\u2019t know much about McGill, but I do know that GWU is not a preferable school if Biology is going to be your field of study.",

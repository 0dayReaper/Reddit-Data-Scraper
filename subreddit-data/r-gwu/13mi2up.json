    "postText": "Hey guys! \n\nI'm an incoming freshman for the class of 2023 and I'm so hyped to attend GW. I'm also Jewish, which has become increasingly important to me over course of the last year. For context, I do not support the state of Israel, though I do believe that Jewish people should ultimately have their own country, more for safety reasons than anything. \n\nBut that's not super important. I've heard that there's a lot of clash about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict at GW, like more than at most schools, and that it's also led to infighting in the Jewish community. This makes me super nervous. On one hand, I 100% support everyone's right to rally and protest about this issue as it is undoubtedly an important one. On the other hand, I'd like to go to Shabbat services at GW Hillel without being told that I'm a bloodthirsty war criminal. \n\nAnyone's feedback is helpful but especially Jewish students. I know GW has a massive Jewish population so let me know; what's it like being Jewish at GW? And how can I practice my faith without getting caught in or contributing to the infighting? \n\nThanks y'all! Raise high!",

            "comment": "Jewish student here. Yes, there is some antisemitism, mostly in terms of blaming us for whatever the Israeli government is doing on any given day. This contrasts with the way I see people not blaming Russian students for Putin or Chinese students for the CCP. That said, the Jewish community is quite active and I feel much safer here as a Jew than I do in my home town. Definitely come here if you can.",

            "comment": "As others have mentioned, you can park for several days without issue, but you shouldn\u2019t be storing your car in the garages unless you have a permit (1/2 month, monthly, or semester). The rates do reset at 2am each day. However, if you use your GWorld card with colonial cash, the highest amount you\u2019ll pay each day is $16.50, and only $12 on weekends. \n\nWhile USC and Elliott have posted hours, you can still access the garage if you have a GWorld card, regardless if you have a permit. The hours are just for outside visitors.",

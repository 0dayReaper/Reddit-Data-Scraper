    "postText": "Has anyone tried to claim compensation for GW housing? \nPretty much every appliance in our dorm has broken at some point over this semester and my roommates and I have called fixit at least once a week since January for issues in our dorm - we\u2019re looking at requesting compensation for this as it\u2019s caused so much stress and wasted a lot of our time. Is this something anyone has done? \nThanks!",

I have no clue what sort of procedure to go through, but you would need to create a compelling enough reason that the time without these broken appliances should constitute a refund as you paid for the rooms under the assumption you\u2019d have full access to your appliances for the entire period.",

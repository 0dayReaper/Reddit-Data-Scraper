There\u2019s been many times I\u2019ve struggled against a strict word count, but my paper is always better in the end. \n\nOne thing you\u2019ll also learn is that university doesn\u2019t reward anyone for writing \u2018more.\u2019 While in high school that was impressive, here, it\u2019s considered extraneous and burdensome.",

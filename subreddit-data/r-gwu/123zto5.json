A planned transfer is going to cost you more time and money in the long run when all your credits don\u2019t transfer.",

I have classes with former World Bank officials, consultants at the highest level, former major bank officials, former Fed officials, etc. All in small classes. GW also has better connections to defense and international business. We aren\u2019t just some Gtown shadow for kids to transfer from. Transfers aren\u2019t guaranteed take a gap year if you really would be that unhappy at GW or AU, either of which would provide a path to diplomacy with Costa Rica",

GWU has a lower average cost after aid but is still expensive. if you are not sure about transferring I would say go to gw but if u are then maybe a state school would be best? although gw has a good rep with transfers and people who transfer out typically get into good schools but its not guaranteed, but why do you want to transfer out if your interests are very gw minded?",

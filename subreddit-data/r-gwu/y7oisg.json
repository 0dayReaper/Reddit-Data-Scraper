    "postText": "Hello, \n\nI'm a first semester freshmen at Elliott and I want to switch to Business School for the second semester. Right now, I'm taking UW 1020 and I have AP credits for both ECON 1011 and 1012 ready to transfer next semester. I read the GWU internal transfer website, but I'm wondering if anyone ever have an experience switching schools their second semester first year at GWU?",

Other than the fact that administrative stuff takes a while to process it\u2019s not hard, very easy and gwsb isnt competitive like Elliot for admission.",

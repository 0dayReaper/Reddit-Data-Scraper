College is a huge adjustment I\u2019m not just academics and it especially helps you that you have all that AP credit, which probably means you\u2019ll be able to graduate earlier. Make sure you meet with an academic advisor to ensure you\u2019re on track if you want to double major, but don\u2019t overtax yourself first semester freshman year. Just try to make friends and have some fun.",

Worst case, you have to drop one, but you can do that easily as long as you drop it soon enough. Dropping classes is a lot easier than getting new classes that late in the process.",

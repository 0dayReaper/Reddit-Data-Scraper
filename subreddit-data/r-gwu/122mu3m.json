    "postText": "Hi! im a current freshman at gw and im thinking about transferring out of here at the end of this year. i\u2019ve had a really difficult time connecting with people this year and my only friend is my roommate. i\u2019ve tried putting myself out there so many times but i feel like nobody wants to really be friends with me. a lot of the kids in my class already knew each other and i feel pretty judged by them sometimes. i feel so alone at this school and i can\u2019t tell whether it\u2019s just me? i love going out, hanging with friends, chilling, or doing anything really. but i just haven\u2019t found my people here and i don\u2019t know if i will. the school academically is fine, and i don\u2019t really have any issues with that. but i think the community aspect of gw is bothering me? i don\u2019t know if lack of friends/extreme feeling of loneliness is something worth transferring for though. i know that gw is a city school and i definitely have to put in the effort to meet people, but sometimes i wish people would reciprocate back!! could someone please advise me whether they think i should stay or not? Thank you!!!",

            "comment": "So sorry things aren't clicking for you.  Hard to say why without knowing you and knowing more.\n\nI'm afraid you've missed the transfer window for most equivalent schools:  you'll probably need to shoot for the following school year, although you could go to a community College for a semester or two.\n\nBefore you go, though, as a parent I'd remind you that college is temporary --just 4 years for most-- and the purpose is to put you on track for a career you are passionate about.  If you are getting that out of GW, I'd consider staying.\n\nOne other suggestion that might cause an allergic reaction in some, but if the challenge is making friends socially, then consider a social greek organization.  It's been 30 years since I graduated, but there was a fit for everyone when i was there, not just the rich, athletic and well-dressed, and I made 100+ friends in mine I'm still close with 30 years later.  Mine was just a bunch of really smart, fun,  people with no hazing and good parties, with a broad range of political and demographic identities.  When I look back at what I got out-of GW, that was the biggest thing for me.  I joined by accident and it turned into one of the best things I've ever done.  :)",

                            "comment": "The only thing I knew about Greek life when i came to GW was that I wanted nothing to do with it.  Ironically, I still feel that way, even though I still volunteer.\n\nI was in charge of rush for my fraternity when I was there, and my approach was just bringing in a diverse group of good guys, especially those who wouldn't normally go Greek.  We probably had a few more guys who leaned conservative than liberal, but also had guys who wound up working in Democratic orgs after college.   We had PoC, and my best friend in the frat happened to be black, and I'm about as pasty white as you can get.  I'd suggest next fall you go to the Rush events, and see if you click with any.  I known there are also greeknl orgs for kids who are black, Asian, Hispanic, etc, but admit I don't know if it's a combined rush.  But just remember, you are interviewing THEM, not the other way around.  Unless you click and feel truly wanted and see people you want to associate with, don't join.  And avoid any that seem group-thinky.  But that's just my opinion.  But I'll note my fraternity, now long gone, changed after I left, and only wanted \"cool guys.\"  They died three years later from that decision.  The cool guys are usually not the good guys.\n\nSorry about the business fraternity.  I can't imagine why they would reject anyone who shows interest.  But maybe things are different than I recall nowadays.  It hurts to get rejected.  But consider it a favor.  If they don't want you, then fuck them.  They aren't people capable of true friendship anyway.  There's a lot of superficial people out there... and you'll get that at any competitive school I guess.  But I came from white trash squalor, so never fit in... until I stumbled on my fraternity.\n\nThings will get easier next year.  Make sure you go to the activities fairs, maybe you'll also find some non Greek clubs and groups you click with.  :)",

Adding on to the inquiry about Greek life - have you tried looking at the Multicultural or even professional Greek orgs? I joined an MGC sorority my freshman year and have made lifelong friends from there (graduated 2019) but would say I felt like I didn\u2019t find my solid group of people until sophomore year. I know Greek life, especially MGC can be vastly different compared to when I was there but wanted to put it out there just in case to see if you\u2019ve explored that option!\n\nEdit to add that I completely overlooked about the business fraternity but still putting MGC out there!",

Feel free to PM me if you want guidance on where/how to look!\n\nBut as to the social scene, I think YMMV but from personal experience and those around me, sophomore year did help quite a bit. I think once you declare your major and start taking classes more aligned to that instead of gen ed, you\u2019ll also start seeing the same people and that also helps with forming connections too at least on the academic level. There were people I met and talked to quite a bit freshman year only to never talk to them again after that. There were those I now consider lifelong friends that I might\u2019ve known about or saw passing the street but didn\u2019t actually form a connection with them until sophomore or even junior year. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to say without knowing you and the efforts you\u2019ve put in so far, but joining orgs and clubs (even outside of Greek life) will DEFINITELY help you out a lot at the school from my experience.",

I will say a lot of clubs and sororities can be toxic at times depending on who\u2019s running them but keep trying new ones. Even if it\u2019s just doing a low stakes club like GW Trails - you can meet a lot of new people and hopefully find some folks more aligned with your interests. Freshman year is also a very tough year - trying to balance social and educational responsibilities, finding your niche, and being the one to set your schedule is stressful. Be sure to take advantage of the free mental health visits in the clinic if you need them. It\u2019s ok to need help and it\u2019s also ok to look at other schools if they\u2019re a better fit for you as a person. Be kind to yourself and I hope you find a group that meshes well with you - even if it\u2019s at another University.",

University is about education and unfortunately we can lose sight of that fact especially after being so isolated during the pandemic and when many other students are out and about. \nWhereas socializing is important ,academics is where it\u2019s at. With the unstable economy it\u2019s best to focus on what you can control- your academics! You sound like a lovely person and you will meet like minded people along the way.

            "comment": "Hi, sophomore here! I made most of my friends during orientation week, but that definitely isn't the case for everyone and a lot of them have fallen through. Unfortunately it can be very difficult to make friends in freshman year classes because a lot of them are huge and don't encourage you to talk to other people. I don't know about GWSB, but in CCAS as a poli sci major, those giant first-year classes were barely social even with people I did know. In my experience, it gets better as your classes get smaller, which will hopefully be your sophomore year! I've made friends with people I shared multiple classes with in the same semester because we saw each other all the time.\n\nJoin some smaller clubs, it's easier to talk to people when there aren't dozens of them who all already know each other. I saw your response about the business frat (I'm sorry they wouldn't take you, they suck), but there are a whole lot of other organizations that take everyone and are full of kinder, friendlier people. Being in smaller academic programs helps too (I added on a minor in a very tiny interdisciplinary program with very niche classes), because you see the same people in a lot of your classes; it's hard to ignore each other for very long.\n\nMy biggest regret at GW is not branching out earlier because it really bit me in the ass this year with knowing no one outside of my group of friends. It's not too late to start going to club meetings, but it can be scary when you don't know anyone. Finally, and this is really terrible advice, so I'm saying this as a complete last resort: I wouldn't have made those o-week friends if I had met them sober. Alcohol can really drop the social anxiety and make everyone more amicable IF CONSUMED RESPONSIBLY. The infrequent frat parties often have free drinks and you can chat with a lot of people there, or you can invite people on your dorm floor over if you can get a hold of stuff to drink (and you can DM me if you need help with that). Just be smart about it. If you feel like after all of that you still want to transfer, that's really fair! But just consider that people at other colleges already have established friend groups too, and it might not be the solution you think it is.",

They always throw on Halloweekend, but other than that it's impossible to know. It's super hard to ask people to go out, but you gotta put yourself out there and be vulnerable if you want to make friends. It's really hard (and that's why I don't do it sober). It does get better and I've made plenty of friends in my sophomore year, so don't give up hope.",

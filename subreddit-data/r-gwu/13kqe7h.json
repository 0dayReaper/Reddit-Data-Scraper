    "postText": "Incoming first year student here - I know registration isn't for a while for me but I'm really curious what exactly happens during registration. \n\n\\- Does the page look similar to the \"Plan Ahead\" screen where you create schedule possibilities?\n\n\\- I heard that if you have a plan set up, you can somehow put that plan into the registration page and be registered for all your courses in like 30 seconds. Is this true/how does this work? It seems like it'd save a lot of time if I could just pull up my plan and hit register on those classes instead of inputting codes for each one individually.\n\nLiterally anything is helpful, I just wish I knew what the portal looked like before it opens for me, I really want to get good classes/time slots.",

You can also import your Plan Ahead schedule with two clicks using the toolbar at the top of the screen. The front end interface itself is easy to use and intuitive.\n\nThe issue is the back end. The servers are very finicky and will randomly kick you. Once it kicks you, it might not let you back on for like 5 minutes. DO NOT click your brower\u2019s back button under any circumstance and make sure you have steady internet connection.\n\nI cannot stress this enough, DO NOT USE THE BACK BUTTON.",

            "comment": "\"Plan\" doesn't refer to anything formal. What students do is look at the Schedule of Classes and write down the CRNs of the courses they are interested in.\n\nWhen registration opens, there will be open fields where you can copy and paste up to 4-5 CRNs at once, then click \"Register.\" You'll be able to enroll in each of those sections so long as:\n\n1) They do not require pre-requisites to be completed beforehand;\n\n2) They are set aside for Majors only (or students who are part of certain Programs, such as Honors);\n\n3) They do not require a department signature to get in;\n\n4) The seats are not full.\n\nIn the case of 4), some classes--but not all--are set up with a Waitlist you can join. However, if you enroll in one section of the class you want, you cannot join the Waitlist of another *preferred* section for that same course. So it's a gamble.\n\nTry to come up with multiple versions of an ideal schedule. The majority of courses at GW only have meeting times Monday - Thursday, with a few exceptions requiring seminar/discussion times on Fridays. \n\nTake UW 1020 right away. A number of seats are set aside for freshman during Fall registration, which makes it the easiest time for incoming students to get this requirement out of the way. After that, it can become increasingly harder to get into a UW course whose topic interests you, since upper classman fight over the same limited seats each semester. \n\nSecondary consideration: prioritize courses that will allow you to knock out GPAC requirements early. Degree Requirements can usually be fulfilled by different courses. Get acquainted with DegreeMAP, which will link you to a list of course codes that can be counted toward that requirement block. For example, your \"Humanities\" requirement can easily be fulfilled by a philosophy course, english course, film course, art course, etc. Just make sure you're checking the course information on every course before you register. You won't be allowed to later count a course you \"thought counted...\" because you didn't research the requirements well enough. If you have questions, ask your Academic Adviser. Focus on the more major-specific courses in Sophomore year and above. It always sucks when there's a cool course you want to take but it conflicts with a prerequisite seminar that you absolutely have to take. \n\nAnd since we don't really know what major you're declaring, you should consider your current skillset with respect to writing and STEM. If you're a student who excels at writing and research, then having a schedule loaded with term papers isn't likely to weigh on you; but a math-heavy and lab-heavy schedule might pose issues, since they will require more attention. And vice-versa. \n\nStart your language track early. If you have pre-college experience in a foreign language, write to the department and see if you can take a placement exam early. There is no testing out of language, only testing to be eligible to apply for higher level sections (e.g. skipping Beginner Spanish 1001 and 1002 to enrolling in Intermediate Spanish 2001). For these placement tests, you have to meet a minimum score and get department approval to register manually using an RTF-EZ Form (google it).\n\nWhen you have your schedule(s) set, request a meeting with your Academic Adviser. They can usually meet with you virtually and give you feedback on your schedule. \n\nConsider what non-class commitments you want to make. Do you want to rush for greek life? Do you want to intern? Will you be working part-time? All of these activities take time away from studying. So if you are the type of student that wants to get heavily involved, it may work in your advantage to take fewer courses your first semester to get your feet wet. You will typically need permission to take 18+ credit hours; 15 is considered a \"recommended\" cut-off. So don't be surprised if your adviser suggests you go down to 12 hours in your first semester. It's not a reflection on your ability, rather, it comes out of years of watching first-year freshman take on too many things and getting sub-standard grades. \n\nGood luck!",

    "postText": "I intend to learn Hindi, but it's only offered via studying in India; GWU doesn't offer any Hindi classes or placement tests. Can it still be my \"language learned\" in place of e.g Spanish, or would Hindi not count towards this requirement and I'd have to study both Spanish as my main language AND Hindi? Thanks!",

Unless you are a native Hindi speaker, then your TOEFL would be enough. Do you currently speak Hindi? How do you plan to achieve 3-year proficiency by studying abroad?",

Isn't it the case that the language you take determines the country you work with, especially with FSO? Like I wouldn't be placed in Brazil if I spoke Chinese...\n\nI can speak a non-Hindi Indian language well and I have some basic understanding of Hindi.",

For the state department I think it\u2019s more that they place you where you\u2019re needed and give you the necessary language training. But if you wanted to work with an organization that specifically dealt with India-US affairs then having proficiency in Hindi would definitely help. \n\nHowever your main goal should be to graduate, and you need that certified proficiency in any foreign language to graduate from Elliott. Because GW doesn\u2019t offer Hindi (which it should, especially because Elliotts dean is a specialist in South Asia), you would need to find a way to become proficient in Hindi by the time you graduate. I don\u2019t know if a semester or even a year abroad would provide you with that proficiency without taking any other measures. I wouldn\u2019t recommend relying on studying abroad to bring you to a point where you will be able to pass a Hindi proficiency test. \n\nOne thing that I\u2019m thinking is that you could take a proficiency test in the Indian language you do know to just get that requirement out of the way, and then pursue self studying in Hindi on top of studying abroad. No need to worry about getting that requirement when you\u2019re already fluent in a language other than English. What year are you currently?",

I think if you did this program, and maybe a Middlebury summer program, you could pass a proficiency test.\n\nEdit; also, I would try to figure a way to bring this to the attention of the dean. there SHOULD be Hindi courses at GW, and you will probably find her to be supportive of that since she speaks Hindi iirc",

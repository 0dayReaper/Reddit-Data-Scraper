I was wondering if anyone had experience with this program? \n\nHow does job placement look at graduation (couldn't find stats online)? Is the program fun/competitive? How would you compare it to NC State's MSA Program?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated ! Feel free to chat me if you don't wanna post a reply publicly\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!!",

I have graduated with my Bachelor\u2019s in IT, I am looking at GW for their Masters Cyber security programs - unfortunately they\u2019re online but, I was wondering if anyone has experience with their Masters Cybersecurity program? is it worth it? I am choosing between their Analytics and their policy/compliance one. \n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Friesian is correct. The MS in Cybersecurity offers the same courses seated and online. The content isn't different, although the attention and feedback you get  on assignments will likely be more immediate for in-person coursework. However, this isn't a guarantee. The instructors in the CISM program are adjuncts with full-time jobs outside GWU, which often leaves them busy. While most instructors are responsive, it's been in my experience that those responses are generally well beyond the point of being helpful. The solution? Build relationships with students and exchange numbers/emails. \n\nStaff are great. The Program is small, so the Director and Student Success administrator tend to be involved with all students' progress. They also provide secondary support in every course, because they're enrolled as TAs in Blackboard. So they see everything you submit and read any Group emails you send to the class. Sometimes, it's a staff member who may get back to you before the Instructor. They also work really fast to schedule meetings with you, lift holds, and help you get registered. I have never had a negative experience with the CISM team. They're that wonderful. \n\nStudents are **fantastic** and motivated and responsible. Many of them are already mid- to late-career, so they tend to be older than a lot of graduate students outside the college of professional studies. For me, having colleagues who are grown-ups was really refreshing. They don't make excuses the same way 20 year-olds do and they're better at communicating obstacles and asking for help early, rather than waiting until things reach critical mass. \n\nThe assignments you do will serve you well professionally. I learned about the NIST framework around the same time I was tasked with updating security controls in an IT Security Manual for work. The research I've done for course projects/papers has allowed me to build bibliographies that I've tapped into for security briefs. I also established myself as a good writer; so if you have experience with APA citations, you'll be highly valuable during group projects (and so many students struggle with works referenced pages). \n\nThe only difference between Analytics and Policy is really dependent on your tech background. There are a lot of crossover courses. The Analytics course will give you more engagement with Cloud Security and Python, but both will require a lot of research and writing. I went with the Policy side, because I could easily--and more efficiently--get the technical training I needed from PluralSight, Udemy, and a bootcamp. \n\nMy suggestion: research careers in tech/cybersecurity and find out what skills and expertise you'll need to get there. Then return to the curricula for both the Analytics and Policy programs and see which line-up of courses more closely resemble the things you'll need in pursuit of your career.",

However, that doesn't mean there couldn't be projects where you might put coding skills to use. I'm only halfway through and haven't gotten to the Security Architecture course (i.e. it's notorious for having a heavy workload, but I'm not sure if it's more about learning how systems operate v. building those systems). TBD.\n\nIn the Data Analytics course, you'll pretty much be teaching yourself R.",

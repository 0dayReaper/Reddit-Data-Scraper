The specs are here [Best Buy Asus Rog Zephyrs M16](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-rog-zephyrus-m16-gu603-gaming-laptop-intel-core-i9-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-1tb-ssd-off-black/6464203.p?skuId=6464203&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD-ORIgr1EvTYDaRGUC9OZJDFHTF0&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD-ORIgr1EvTYDaRGUC9OZJDFHTF0&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwguGYBhDRARIsAHgRm49gu0slxaplR-FbwprNkmMichUYF3Ew9nHJ2S9NUuPpYtzFVJmsdl0aAqNYEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds)\n\nAlthough the Laptop is 1800$ at Best Buy, I purchased it on sale last February and have enjoyed it a lot. However, a family member bought a MacBook Pro 14 for me and I use that primarily for school. I also phased out of gaming and want to focus on other things in life. \nIn terms of the condition of the computer, it is in Excellent condition and works smoothly. It can be loud on turbo mode when you game, but you might already play with headphones so it doesn\u2019t matter. It also has a silent mode with zero fan noise for quieter settings.\n\nMy ask price is 1000$\n\nI know it\u2019s a lowball for me but I have too much tech and rather get rid of this thing. \nDM me for more details or if your interested.",

    "postText": "This is my first time posting here, and I am on mobile \u2014 I apologize in advance if the formatting is odd, or if I was supposed to post this elsewhere. \n\nTLDR; I got a B- in a class that I had no grade lower than a 90% in. Could this be from a curve?\n\nAre professors even allowed to curve final grades in a way that makes them lower than they actually are? \n\nFor context (this will be lengthy\u2026) I took SOC 1001 with Jee Jee Kim this past semester, and I just received my final grade. To sum the situation up I have received mostly 100s in the class, and my lowest individual grade was a single 90%. I attended, participated, and did all my work on time. For some reason my final grade in banweb is a B- (specifically according to my professor 83%). I emailed her assuming it was a mistake. About a day later she sent an email to the entire class saying too many people were emailing her complaining about their grades, and that we should not email the sociology department with grading matters. Later that day I was met with a somewhat hostile reply to my email in which she pretty much told me she is busy, my grade is final, my homework and exams brought my grade down, and that it\u2019s not that big of a deal to get a B-. It honestly barely applied to my situation and seemed copied and pasted. She even attached a grade table where she input incorrect grades of mine that were lower than they actually are (although all still were above 90%), and had them totaled up to average into 83%. I assumed this was a mistake and oversight on her part and replied essentially saying I want her to look into my grades because it is impossible to have all As result in a B-. She then replied (3 days later) saying that 75 people have complained about grades, my\ngrade is final, she will not change any grades, the B- is correct, and insinuated that my grade is due to late assignments. I literally went into Blackboard to confirm it \u2014 I turned\nnothing in late! The only reason for her stubbornness I can come up with is that she uses a curve that brings grades down. Hence my question\u2026 is that even allowed?\n\nAlso side note: if this is not due to a curve deflating my grade, is this enough to email the department or dean to report some kind of a grade issue? Or is that just ridiculous?\n\nThank you for your advice and answers in advance!",

            "comment": "It sounds like you've taken all the appropriate steps to work this out with the professor. When they are being obstinate or unfair, then you have the right to appeal to the Department Chair. However, you should think of this as a hierarchical process for which it is your responsibility to go through each step.\n\nStep 1: Write to your faculty member to appeal your grade.Step 2: Write to the Department Chair to summarize the outcome and ask for them to review the grade.Step 3: Write the undergraduate dean's office for a final review.\n\nMake sure to:\n\n1. Save every documentation from Blackboard that shows the timestamp of when you submitted your work as well as the quantitative grade (i.e. points) given to your assignment. Save them in a folder, labeled for ease (e.g. Module 1 - Discussion 1, Module 2 - Short Essay response, etc.) as PDFs.\n2. Review your GW email inbox for the confirmation emails that Blackboard sends when you upload assignments to corroborate your times. Save them as PDFs.\n3. Create a timeline of dates you reached out to your instructor, along with the outcomes. Save it as a PDF.\n4. If have you any additional documentation where your professor approved an extension on an assignment due to illness, but then did not score you correctly, that is also worth saving to provide later. Save those emails as well as any other medical documentation as PDFs.\n\nMake sure that EVERY follow-up to the Chair is respectful and honest. You can decide whether to cc: your Instructor or not, but they will be notified regardless and asked to provide documentation to verify that the B- you were given was indeed earned. They are not going to be compelled with arguments such as \"Other students are saying the same thing and complaining.\" Stick to the facts as they affect you; you don't know the reasons why another student got the grades they did and no one under FERPA will be allowed to discuss them with you anyway. Always, always, always make sure you are being respectful and kind in your emails. **Do not embellish; do not lie; do not make threats**. Explain the situation and stick to the facts (and it helps to include the impact this has on you personally if, say, a lower GPA might threaten your financial aid status or applications to future programs). Edit your emails and have someone read them over so you know where to make cuts to unnecessary information.\n\nFinally, if you still believe that your case is not given the proper attention (or if you are being dismissed without a review), you can appeal to your school's Undergraduate Dean. Provide them with the same documentation you provided the Chair and then summarize the outcomes (i.e. provide the rationale for why you're writing the Dean's Office in the first place). It is important that you clarify that you have taken Steps 1 and 2 before writing to the Dean. They will investigate by reviewing your documentation, speaking to the Chair/faculty member, and then making a final decision. **Do not go over the Chair's head**. The Dean's Office will only refer you right back to the department head.\n\nFaculty aren't perfect, so please allow for some human error. I have personally seen students pursue grade changes and win due to unfair grading practices and/or faculty error; it happens. But if you are being denied the opportunity to have your grade correct, because a faculty member refuses to review their grading history, then you have cause for an appeal. Present an honest case and be patient with the process. Be persistent and always follow-up over email, so you're creating a paper trail.\n\nLast tidbit of advise: while it's okay to involve your parents or some other support system as you go through this process, understand that the faculty member, chair, and dean are under no obligation to respond to them if they decide to intervene on your behalf (and the majority of them likely will not if they feel threatened or harassed). In fact, I would not suggest allowing anybody else to speak for you. If you want to cc: them, that's okay, but instruct them to remain observant and support you on the backend. \n\nI have seen, firsthand, appeals where parental involvement can actually hurt a student's chances, because they either lack the full information (i.e. their kid has lied to them) or they want to start the conversation by making threats (in which the University closes ranks and ignores you unless you involve an attorney, which will make no one happy). The university will treat you like an adult, so approach this matter like one.",

If it was worth a lot and you did worse than usual (which isn't uncommon), it could have pulled your grade way down. Again, it clearly seems like other things are at play here, but just wanted to mention.",

Let\u2019s say you had a 90 in the class before the final (but it was likely higher) and got a 90 on the final (the lowest it can be and still be and A-), you should have gotten an A- in the class. The math is not mathing. \n\nI would take screen shots of all of the grades in blackboard and make sure you have copies of the syllabus. This should be an easy fix for the department chair. It\u2019s harder when the prof doesn\u2019t grade anything until the end, don\u2019t put individual grades into blackboard, and then bam your final grade is reported and super low. \n\nLiterally the only other logical reason I can think of is if the syllabus has language like \u201cfailure to attend 90% of classes will result in a full letter grade reduction.\u201d But it honestly seems like your professor is unwell or made a huge mistake while entering grades and doesn\u2019t want to fix it with so many students.",

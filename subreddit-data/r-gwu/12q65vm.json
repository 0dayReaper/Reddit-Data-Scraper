So okay we can move away from an active shooter  if you want.\n\nThere is zero - and I mean zero - EVIDENCE that giving private security forces prevents crime (including mass shootings) or that it\u2019s the most effective intervention for crime. What we do know is that the presence of guns increases aggression and makes deescalation of situations less likely. Especially for unarmed suspects. Guns create tension that didn\u2019t need to exist in the first place.\n\nWe have more \u201ctrained\u201c armed police per capita in DC than any or most other metro area. Guns for our private security force is not necessary. If MPD officers being constantly all over foggy bottom armed don\u2019t make you feel safe, arming our private security forces won\u2019t either.",

Private security can be found outside the World Bank, for example (and spoiler, they're armed too). Secondly, we\u2019re not talking about prevention here\u2014 just ensuring that GWPD is able to respond to calls for service involving weapons if they are the closest unit, as I personally know MPD can be 2-3 minutes away at best. Third, I think you\u2019re mistakenly equating arming senior officers with more violence\u2014 that\u2019s just not the case. These supervisors aren\u2019t the ones responding to minor offenses, and if they do respond to medical or mental health calls, Emerg can have them leave if their presence would escalate the situation.",

And yes, I'm equating arming officers with more shootings - it's very simple that more guns = more shootings, including accidental ones. \n\nI work in evidence-based research. Again, no evidence that more guns = more safety. You can argue otherwise but the research works against you, I'm sorry.",

The argument is that arming GWPD officers isn\u2019t the way to keep students safe.

What we do know is that the presence of guns make situations more difficult to deescalate and that police violence disproportionately impacts Black people (students). \n\nEveryone in here is concerned about rising violence in DC; I am too. Arming GWPD will not prevent it nor will it make me feel safer. MPD already has a constant presence on campus as does the secret service and park police (who have responded when I needed them; not GWPD). I really am so perplexed by people who think that GWPD having a gun will make things safer. The data do not indicate that.",

GWPD probably does already have firearms in a safe in their police center/on-campus station (AUPD has rifles and handguns in their armory). \n\nNo they don't, for both your claims (GWPD and AUPD don't have firearms in an armory).\n\nYou can search online and see no AU Officers have armed designation on their commissions. https://govservices.dcra.dc.gov/oplaportal\n\n&gt;All university police in DC undergo the same training as MPD officers. \n\nAnd wrong again, University Police in DC go to the Campus Public Safety Institute. Only GWPD send their Officers to external police academies in Maryland.",

I have to trust what I\u2019m told.\nAdditionally, from AUPD\u2019s website: \u201cOfficers are commissioned by DC Metropolitan Police Department's Security Officer Management Branch (SOMB) who conducts a background check and issues the University Special Police Officer Commission. University Special Police Officers are required to attend 250 hours of basic training. Training provided by the DC Consortium of Universities Campus Public Safety Institute may be substituted for the requirement. University Special Police Officers have arrest authority on all property owned and controlled by American University.\u201d\n\nThe UCPSI may be substituted but is not necessarily the only path. I\u2019ve spoken to a couple AUPD officers who were lateral hires from VA police departments.",

Armed University Police in DC are only Howard and UDC (with Catholic having only Supervisors armed).\n\nLaterals are the exception, not the norm. CPSI is how the majority are hired and trained. Laterals are similar to any other Police Department in the US, where states allow those with POST (Police Officers Standards and Training) certificates to come in to another state and join another police department with little or no additional training needed beyond a legal refresher for that State's laws.",

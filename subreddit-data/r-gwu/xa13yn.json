    "postText": "&gt;\u201d To: GW Community Members\n \n&gt;Beginning Monday, September 12, 2022, masks will be optional but remain strongly recommended in all university-owned or -operated facilities with limited exceptions:\n \n&gt;**Masks are required in indoor instructional settings, such as classrooms and teaching laboratories.**\n\n&gt;Masks are required on GW transportation, including the Mount Vernon Express, VSTC Express and SafeRide. \n\n&gt;Masks are required in university health care facilities, including the Student Health Center and the GW Medical Faculty Associates, which is consistent with the District of Columbia\u2019s guidance. \n \n&gt;Although masks are optional on our campuses, their use is strongly encouraged. Individuals may choose whether to wear a mask based on a variety of reasons. We ask that you respect the personal decisions of others who continue to choose to wear a mask. N95 masks remain the most effective way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19, and they continue to be available for free to community members at GW\u2019s test sites.  \n \n&gt;We will continue to monitor rates of COVID-19 on our campuses and in the region and may reinstate any such public health requirements as necessary. The university\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine and booster requirements continue to provide strong protection for our community members from severe illness or hospitalization. Thank you for your continued cooperation as we work together to keep one another safe and healthy.\u201d\n\n\nThis would be cool and all except the majority of my professors already don\u2019t even wear a mask and don\u2019t care if their students do.",

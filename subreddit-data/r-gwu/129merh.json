    "postText": "Hello guys. I\u2019m now getting offers from GWU MSF and UConn msfrm and I\u2019m struggling with the decision.\n\nFor me the pros about GWU is the location in Washington, I guess it means more job opportunities than CT? And also the campus is bigger than uconn Hartford. Thirdly, finance curriculum is more thorough for me , for I\u2019m not major in financial as an undergraduate, maybe I can find my true path of career when learning in gwu. And obviously Washington has much efficient subway.\n\nAs for the cons , the two year fee for MSF is 90k and it\u2019s nearly double of UConn frm tuition fee which is 54k. And also I\u2019ve heard that purely financial degree can be hard to find a job.\n\nSo if anyone here can help giving me any info to help my decision I\u2019d be grateful.\n\nThanks!",

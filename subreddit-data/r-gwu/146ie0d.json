    "postText": "I\u2019m (25M) coming from NY looking for housing for around August before I start grad school at ESIA. I have a max budget of $900 a month for rent, and I don\u2019t plan on bringing a car down with me. Does anyone know any good areas to look that fall in that price range, and that I can rely on public transportation to get to and from the school? \n\nI was looking on the Off Campus Housing website, but a lot of stuff looks like scams/too good to be true. I\u2019m getting overwhelmed like I\u2019m not gonna find something in time lol.",

            "comment": "I would suggest joining some housing Facebook groups. They'll usually have people looking for roommates or open spots in group homes. Those are going to be your best options when it comes to working with that budget. They'll usually have options in northern VA, DC and MD. There are tons of groups for DMV housing on Facebook. You can also check out FB marketplace as people will also list postings there. If you'd like to expand your budget I would suggest picking up a part-time job either on or near campus. Plenty of students work at local bars/restaurants but you're also able to pick up research stipends if you get involved with a project on campus. Best of luck with the search!",

My studio on campus years ago was $1450 and it was the cheapest in foggy at the time, it\u2019s probably closer to $1600 now. Most room shares are around $1100 but maybe you\u2019ll get lucky and find something in your range.",

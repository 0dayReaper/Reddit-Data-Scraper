    "postText": "Hi, y'all, \n\nI'm a senior, and I've been debating over whether or not to RD or EDII for GW; my guidance counselor tells me it's a reach, but on Naviance, nationally, the school is a match for my SAT (my only time I was able to take it) 1340, and my unweighted GPA 91.79 (roughly 3.7), and my ACT is low (24; first time, and didn't decide to take it again), so I wasn't gonna submit that. I did FASFA, and my EFC was 0, and I also have a parent on disability, and my other is unemployed, but after doing the GW tuition calculator, I got that 20k was going to be my tuition. The main issue is the money aspect since my family income is about 35k. I'm willing to get involved in work-study, but in terms of the school being a reach/target, would it benefit my chances of getting admitted by taking the risk with EDII? Or should I go with RD? I read some posts that said ED lowers merit-based scholarships/general financial aid because it shows you're committed to coming to the school. But I'm really interested in gw, but I don't really want to be this much in debt.",

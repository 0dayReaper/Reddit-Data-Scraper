    "postText": "I got into GWU as a spring admit for 2024.  I have been thinking about this a lot and I am worried it will be hard to settle in and I would miss out on the freshman experience (orientation, making friends, etc). GWU was one of my top choices, but I have doubts about this offer.\n\nIf anyone here has knowledge or insight into being a freshman spring admit or could give me any info, that would be great! thanks :)",

            "comment": "I'm a 2023 spring admit and I'm absolutely loving my time here so far. I was stressed about the exact same things you are but in retrospect I shouldn't have been worried at all. GW doesn't give you much communication in that empty semester but just hang in there and everything will work out fine. \n\nMaking friends was super easy and I wasn't even that talky during orientation (Orientation itself was just a one-day thing but still a good experience). I made about four friends at orientation (not a lot) that I still talk to and they introduced me to their friends which gave me a pretty big circle. As far as I can tell, a lot of spring admits also made friends with a lot of spring admits, so it's a pretty tight community. On top of that, clubs and organizations were also super receptive to me joining them in the middle of the year. I made a lot of upperclassmen friends that way. \n\nI think it's pretty important that you fill up that empty semester with something meaningful, whether you're doing community college, doing an internship, working or whatever. I know some people who were going to be going in the spring and then dropped it because they got disillusioned by GW during those three months as they didn't do anything during that time. I personally did an internship over the summer and fall so I have something to compensate for that missing semester. \n\nGW itself is also amazing imo. All of my professors are really passionate and make an effort to connect to their students (Although I did tailor my schedule around their RateMyProfessor scores). D.C is an amazing city that has that urban feeling without making you feel super crammed and crappy like NYC (D.C has 18+ clubs too!).\n\nLast piece of advice, try to select your roommates in advance. I know a lot of spring admit freshman that got put in really nice upperclassmen quad dorms with people they connected with online. I did a random roommate thing and they put me in a pretty awful room on the vern. But if they do put you on the Vern just go to the housing office and tell them you're on the Vern and they'll help you out (at least they did for me).\n\nThat's it. Go Hippos!",

            "comment": "Hi there! I'm a freshman spring admit student for 2023 and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have :)\n\nTo respond to your post now, I'm going to be brutally honest so even if you decide to come still you're prepared. You do miss out on the freshmen experience because like all of the fun student events are in the fall. Also the orientation is kinda ass- like they did nottt do a good job at welcoming us at all-baseline information at best. And making friends is difficult, but you just have to push through with clubs and such- mostly though you are close with other spring admits. \n\nTo fill up the fall semester- Internships are hard to come by if you're still trying to figure out your career, have financial barriers, and many many more situations. Also, the Spring Admit decision throws you for a loop so it's even harder to get things straight. So if you can study abroad or stay distracted, great. But if you have doubts, listen to them. My roommate and I are both spring admits and agree that GW is great now that we're here, but all the shit that we had to go through to get here (no communication, administrators lying to us, no proper information, literally couldn't get in our dorm when we got here) is not worth it. As far as friends she's my best friend and we have a few other spring admit friends, but that's it. There is also just a general feeling of being socially and academically behind because you just don't know certain things and nobody tells you. Nobody is really helpful here either other than professors, who are lovely btw :)\n\nMy honest advice as someone that loves GW and loves DC, if you have other top choices, go with them. At least for the 2023 class it was hell and that's not to say there weren't/are good parts now, but overall it's a cost-benefit analysis. If GW as a school isn't going to give you a huge boost in your future and you have doubts, I'm not sure the spring admit program is worth it for you. I hope you figure things out and if you have any more questions reach out :)",

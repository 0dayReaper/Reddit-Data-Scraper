We\u2019re just going to \u2018mask up!\u2019 for another few years until we all get it and the government declares victory.\n\nBut the real issue for me is that we, as a society, are so afraid of even the slightest risk that we\u2019d reimplement mandates and lockdowns even after we have the long-awaited vaccine. This is bonkers at this point and I\u2019m near completely certain we\u2019re going back online when Delta inevitably spreads across campus.

If we use their pattern as an example like [Dr. Scott Gottlieb](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-delta-variant-turn-corner-gottlieb/) and other scientists think, we would begin to see a downward trend of cases somewhere around August 20 as we are currently in week four of this cycle.\n\nThere is one difference: United Kingdom vaccination rates are currently better than the United States', but at the start of the uptick for the U.K., they had about the same numbers as ours.",

You are significantly less likely to get severe symptoms but you are still able to spread the disease. Until the vast majority of the population is fully vaccinated, it's still a risk to the wider community. You might be fine, but you can still spread it to others who can get severly ill or die.",

Even in a fully vaccinated population, the danger that the Delta variant poses is significant. \n\nSource: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/majority-covid-19-cases-large-public-events-were-among-vaccinated-us-cdc-study-2021-07-30/?taid=61044c3eca93a4000184e3d6&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter\n\nEdit: 4 hosptilizations across 900 or so infected people shows how effective the vaccine is. This comment is not anti-vax in anyway. Im in a country thats lagging a bit in vaccines, and the first thing im gonna do when I arrive in the US is get vaccinated. I mention this story to show how I believe its still a good idea to wear masks even if the school is fully vaccinated because of how contagious the delta variant is.",

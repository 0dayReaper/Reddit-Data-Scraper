Does being part of the honors program greatly affect your college experience and professional opportunities at either of these colleges - in other words, should it be a major part of my decision? Thanks for taking the time to help me out!",

            "comment": "living on the vern is a major con of the honors program (and the other freshmen programs too)\n\ncourse registration is the big benefit (honors students maintain priority registration throughout their time at GW but it's useless after sophomore year. I also never had any issues getting all of my classes without priority registration so it's not something I'd value that highly)\n\ncopypasta from an old comment on honors:\n\n* At GW, honors students are required to live in separate honors housing. Being on the vern is not the vibe. When almost every class (and all social events) are on Foggy (and when GW's #1 draw is being in the city), getting stuck in what feels like the burbs is less than ideal\n* GW does their best to frame honors housing as a positive, but it's only because there's a housing shortage downtown (due to the administration's poor planning). My freshman year, honors students could live wherever they wanted, and like everyone else, they tried their best to be downtown\n* Honors classes are unnecessarily difficult, pull down your GPA, and leave you with less time to get involved in clubs or intern (I interned in both the House and Senate my freshman year, which isn't that unusual)\n* the honors requirements (especially the thesis, but also the general requirements as an upperclassman) really eat into your schedule and make it really tough to double major or take advantage of GW's 5-year masters programs. Most of my friends who came in as honors students dropped once they realized how it would mess with their other (more important) plans\n\nwith all that said, I would like to hear an actually positive take on the honors program from someone in the UHP. Am I overlooking a key detail? Am I focusing too much on the negatives?",

            "comment": "Hello! I am apart of UHP at GW and I love it! One of the biggest benefits of UHP is the early registration which is a lifesaver. I am pretty much able to get in every class I need without having to worry about competing with other students. Class-wise I find the honors classes to be extremely interesting. If I was not in the program I would have never taken these classes as they weren\u2019t something that I originally thought I would like. All the teachers are really caring and due to the small class sizes you are easily able to form relationships with them and other students. The classes also are useful as most count for multiple gen-eds, which allows you to knock out requirements quickly. Work-wise it really depends on class. The philosophy ones are a lot of reading but it\u2019s not unmanageable. The science ones are good depending on which you choose (as some are significantly better than others). I found the science to be more difficult as it isn\u2019t a subject I am super interested in. Living wise you do have to live on the Vern in a living learning community. Personally, I don\u2019t think the Vern is that horrific. Most people over-exaggerate or didn\u2019t get to live in West (which is arguably one of the best freshman dorms). The major downside of the Vern is the vex, but in a way that\u2019s a bonding experience for students as everyone complains about it. The living learning community worked well for me. Most of my close friends are honors kids who live nearby. By having the same residence hall we all are easily able to study and hangout with one another which is great. Also as someone coming from a more rural area the Vern is a great transition to DC. Having green space is lovely. Also nearby the Vern there is a great trail to walk (if you want to pet dogs!). One more note on the honors program is the required thesis and classes. Yes, at the end of the program you do have to complete a thesis, but this thesis can be replaced by a separate thesis class (I\u2019m in crim so I have a required one that will fulfill the honors requirement). You can substitute honors classes if needed as well, so if you don\u2019t like any of the science options you can take a different science course.",

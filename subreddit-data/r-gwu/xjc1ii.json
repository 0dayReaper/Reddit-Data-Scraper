    "postText": "Is anyone else having trouble with the Financial Aid Office? They take months to certify loans, weeks to respond to simple questions, and have frequently given me incorrect information (they don't even know how much money is supposed to be in my account). Does anyone have any tips or tricks for dealing with them?\n\nI have been to 3 different universities and worked at a fourth and I have never had so many difficulties just trying to get simple answers and check in on the status of transactions.",

I know it\u2019s tedious but you just have to keep nagging them repeatedly until you get what you need. I\u2019ve found that calling is the most effective way, but expect to spend a lot of time on hold.",

I was on the phone with them and even went higher up to the administration after they would not take of something promised to me.  Nothing happened.  And they president's office did not want to help, and took their department's side.\n\nWhat does one do in such circumstances....\n\nNow again they have wrongfully processed my loan application, and it is so difficult to get across to them.",

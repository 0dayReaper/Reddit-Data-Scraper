My main issues throughout my undergrad:\n\n- Lack of Internal Communication in SEAS \n\n- No clear direction: While in SEAS for CS, I often found myself confused as advisors would tell me things that other advisors say is wrong. This was especially annoying my senior year as I sent in Graduation Clearance Forms in February (that got approved) only to find out that they never looked at and I had to restart the process.\n\n- Very Few Professors in the CS department\n\n- Lack of transparency from professors\n\nI can go deeper if you PM me. Too much to explain on here",

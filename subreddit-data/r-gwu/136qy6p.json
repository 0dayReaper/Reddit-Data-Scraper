    "postText": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m a grad student who needs to fulfill a language requirement for my program and was approved to take CHN3106 instead of the exam. \n\nI have 3 years background learning but a large gap which makes my Chinese questionable so I will have to push it back to Spring 2024. I tried reaching out to the department to get a better idea of what GWU Chinese curriculum looks like/how to prepare but they were unhelpful. \n\nHas anyone taken this course level and can provide some insight? Or be willing to email me a past syllabus?",

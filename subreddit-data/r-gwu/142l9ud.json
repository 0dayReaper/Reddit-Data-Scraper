I was wondering what my chances of admission are without submitting any scores.\n\nFor some more context:\nI\u2019m an upcoming senior at a small high school in Virginia. My stats:\n\nGPA: 4.0/4.0\nClass rank: 4/80\n\nI have taken the most rigorous classes since my freshman year \n\nI\u2019m very active in clubs/extracurriculars\n\nCome from a low-income family and I\u2019m a girl\n\nOver 60 community service hours, looking to hit 100 this summer \n\nStudent tutor/aide at the school\n\nOwn a small graphic design business \n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if I can give any additional info:)",

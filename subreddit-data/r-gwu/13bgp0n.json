    "postText": "Incoming freshman here. I applied and was accepted for political science in the colombian school. however, i was unaware of there being an international affairs program. and i am guilty for this but yes i would like to transfer there since it is highly ranked. either that or i want to double major political science + international affairs. \n\ndoes anybody know how easy it is to do so? i talked to someone in person about it and they said it\u2019s almost guaranteed but they weren\u2019t an official representative of the advising team. thanks!",

You\u2019re not really going to be adding much value to your degree and it\u2019s not gonna do much for you in terms of employability",

Be sure to describe the reasoning behind switching. If you get a vague response or it isn't possible, I'd get in touch with an advisor to plan out your next steps... but I'm actually not sure how to get in contact with one myself yet... LOL. If you do, let me know!",

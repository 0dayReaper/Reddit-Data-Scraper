It\u2019s not cuz dorms are dead, but because it\u2019s DC, and there\u2019s tons of stuff to do and places to be to meet other GW students. \n\nNot really any RAs,",

I\u2019m still friends with a handful of people from my freshman floor. If you\u2019re social and outgoing and just introduce yourself on move-in day, most people will respond positively to that \n\nAnd no, GW no longer has RAs. The residence hall association does host events, and people in your building probably will too, but for the most part I just did my own thing with friends freshman year",

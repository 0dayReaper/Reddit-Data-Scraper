And most of the time people just knock on my doors, regardless of my permission, entering my room, and leaving without saying a word. What\u2019s the point? Sometimes they open the doors and not enter, they just take a peek and leave. Odd, isn\u2019t it?",

Some people are uncomfortable going into another room when someone is actively living there  ( I would know), so they may not enter and fill out a proper report. So to get a thorough report, they may revisit your room.\n\n2.I'm sorry that some people didn't ask for your consent. I understand that can be annoying. \n\n3. It won't be everyday. Mainly the weekdays and until we reach/thoroughly check every residential room. That may take awhile. GW is pretty big, and some halls are bigger than others!\n\n4. If you can, the next time someone comes from facilities,  tell them what's wrong with your room (if anything is wrong) ,and tell them how multiple people have come in and ignored you.\n\nI hope this helps!",

They knocked and if I didn\u2019t open my doors right away because I was taking shower or doing stuff and then they would proceed to open the door with their own cards. And when the employee saw me in my room, he/she would left, and that was it. I was hella confused ngl. And they were not going to fill out any report or stuff, seemed more like inspection.",

    "postText": "I am a freshman at a small liberal arts college. My high school grades were around 92 unweighted and 99 weighted. I had a 3.9 GPA last semester at my college. My extracurriculars are solid but lack internships. I do realize that this is a vague description.\n\nThose who had a similar background to me, were you accepted as a transfer applicant? Are there any specific key points my application will need to hit to be accepted?\n\nIf you currently go to GWU as a transfer student, what has your experience been? What are things that you wish you knew before transferring?",

I just talked in my application about my place in public health and how this program was 'the one' for it. \n\nThe biggest thing I wish I knew before coming here was the lack of consideration for students and education in general. The advisors in almost every college are new and don't stay in the role for more than a year. It says a lot about the culture and is super hard for transfer students specifically. If you're someone who likes to connect with professors and staff it's not really the place, it's very transactional here. I think that was the consensus from others. \n\nI think that students looking for internships an networking do much better here than people who want to academically grow and learn. \n\nBut overall, you'll get experiences here that really help you outside of the classroom and the city is great.",

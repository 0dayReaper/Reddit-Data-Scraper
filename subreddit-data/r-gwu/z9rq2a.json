How hard would it be for a veteran in his mid 20s to land an internship with the CIA or other GS position while being a student at GWU? Is GWU good with helping students land pretty decent jobs after graduation?",

I\u2019m an IA + finance double major, and there are a ton of us doing that specifically. \n\nNot sure how easy it is to do IA + business, and if you\u2019re coming in with credits already, not sure how that would work logistically, but if you reach out to the Elliott advising office (they\u2019re by far the best advising department on campus, try to ask for Ms. Washington specifically) they can help you figure out what your options might be \n\nAs for your question about internships, with actual military experience, you\u2019ll have no trouble getting agency internships in DC. I would say that the most common internship on campus is just your run of the mill hilternship, with DOS being the most popular agency internship among elliott kids, but I have a few friends with internships at three letter agencies they can\u2019t talk about, so I would assume we do well in recruiting \n\nAs for GW helping student land jobs, my answer is in two parts \n\nOn one hand, with a few notable exceptions, I\u2019ve had pretty poor experiences with most advising/career services on campus. The only time I even open emails from career services is if it\u2019s about events with alumni that seem interesting \n\nOn the other hand, GW is the most centrally located DC school with the largest alumni base in the city, and is designed from the ground-up to allow you to intern every semester you\u2019re here and graduate with more work experience than most 2nd or 3rd year professionals. For the most part, professors are *incredibly* well connected in their fields, they and alumni are very willing to help our students with referrals and networking, and if you\u2019re a driven and motivated person, you\u2019ll excel here",

If you do international business with a concentration in international relation or the other way around. \n\nIt would be a very well rounded degree for you, as you will also get business but also the policy stuff. \n\nI was an IB student and I very much was looking at the CIA at the end of college and my degree gave me a lot options in terms of work at the cia.",

Like there are classes that revolve around you working for a company and your grade is based off the work you did for them. They involve you working in a group project on the behalf of an international company I helped several companies sell to the United States or helped us companies sell to Europe. \n\nBut I always know CIA is a route for me because of the risk assessment work I did within my ibus degree and the significant knowledge I learned about how international businesses is conducted.  There was a lot of work involved in risk assessments of foreign countries and the ability to do business in those countries. \n\nI personally didn\u2019t go into the cia because of the experience I got in undergrad really opened the light to working for a multinational and the ability to move from country to country within the organization. I currently work at DSV. \n\nit just really boils down to if u want to do more policy work business work.",

I think GW definitely has connections with agencies and Ibus, Econ, or IA can all help you meet requirements. GW students get a U-Pass that gives you subsidized Metrobus and metro rides so that they can make public transport to the government buildings to work during the school year affordable and easy.\n\nVery important note, you have to check for each three letter agency specifically, but I know for roles at the [CIA](https://www.cia.gov/careers/jobs/undergraduate-internship-program-directorate-of-operations/) due to the background check requirements you apply FRESHMAN FALL for an internship in JUNIOR OR SENIOR YEAR SUMMER (apply fall 22, internship summer of 2024 or 2025), so keep an eye out for super early deadlines.",

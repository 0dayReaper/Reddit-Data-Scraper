    "postText": "Hello! I am a student from UVA that will be living at the GWU dorms over the summer for my internship! I\u2019ve looked up plenty of things to do around dc during my 10 week stay here but I was wondering if anyone had any specific suggestions for the best things to do and places to go! I really want to make the most out of my time here and explore as many things as possible!",

            "comment": "General things: \n\nPick a new museum to go to every week \n\nPick a new bar to try every week \n\nPick a new neighborhood to explore/a cafe to try every week\n\nSpecifics: \n\nDupont Sunday farmers market and second story books \n\nBridge street books in Georgetown (avoid most of the restaurants on M, they\u2019re mostly tourist traps. Good cafes on Wisconsin) \n\nRed derby in petworth. Best dive bar in the city. Great on Friday and Saturday nights (check out their roof) but the best bartender is there on Thursdays (Arthur) \n\nEll\u0113 in mt pleasant for dinner if you can splurge, or their cafe during the day if you\u2019re more on a budget \n\nCheck out adams morgan both during the day and at night \n\nIf shenanigans is still doing power hour (bottomless for $10 on weeknights, including Friday), definitely check that out \n\nFor $1 (I think?) go to the top of the Washington, and then just generally fuck about the monuments at night when you\u2019re drunk with friends \n\nIf you\u2019re interning on the hill, this one\u2019s easy. If you\u2019re not, find someone who is and get a selfie on the speakers balcony. Great DC pic",

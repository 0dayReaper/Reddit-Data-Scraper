    "postText": "Title. I took on way too much this semester and am really behind in two of my classes for my major and starting to think I won\u2019t be able to catch back up by the end of the semester. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019d be a good idea to withdraw from one of them so I have more energy to give to the rest of my classes during finals and hopefully have a W and a B rather than two Cs (or worse).\n\nFor context I\u2019m an English and Poli Sci major so I feel like Cs generally look worse for us than for STEM majors, etc. I\u2019m a senior and taking mostly elective classes next semester so hopefully can raise my GPA that way. Considering grad school but not right after finishing undergrad. I have one W on my transcript already from the pandemic year, and no Cs. What would look best on my transcript in this situation?",

If you're going to have more than a couple years of work before grad school then definitely Don't sweat one C. Heck, I went straight from undergrad to a masters to my PhD program and I have a C my second yo last semester of classes. It was a prereq for a required course, but still the rest of my Grades were good overall.  And the trend of my grades go better throughout undergrad.",

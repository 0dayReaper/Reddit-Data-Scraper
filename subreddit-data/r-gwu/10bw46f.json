Investment banking will always be an uphill climb coming from a non-target school like GW, but with a strong GPA and good networking it\u2019s doable, especially if you\u2019re willing to start out at a lesser known boutique. Aside from that, GW has a pretty strong network in real estate finance/corporate finance/commercial banking/etc and yeah it\u2019s not too bad to get one of those",

    "postText": "I am in between BC (still waitlisted), URich, AU (although I hate it compared to GW), and GW.\n\nI intend to major in international affairs/relations. \n\nI already toured GW and DC not to long ago and honestly I couldn\u2019t ask for a better city. I would have wanted to get accepted to GTown but I screwed up my SAT but GW is great as well. \n\nIs it worth for getting of BC waitlist and checking out URich? I hate frats and heard they are big at those schools. Plus I\u2019ll be farther from DC, where internships are literally in the backyard. Should I just jump the trigger?\n\nHonestly the only thing stopping me is the financial aid package I haven\u2019t gotten yet to make my final decision.\n\nWould there be any disadvantages for not committing right now? What should I do?",

UR is very secluded from the rest of Richmond (many students call it the Richmond bubble) and almost all students live on campus in dorms or apartments. I would agree that Greek life tends to run the social scene at UR but people can often find other clubs to socialize with. I can\u2019t speak much to the social scene at GW but the campus being in downtown DC is extremely different from UR.",

The only way for that to happen is if you put yourself in the position to do (going to certain parties or events).

            "comment": "I agree with the common sentiment that law school rankings are entirely useless, and GW's low ranking doesn't reflect - at all - the strong quality of education you receive. **That being said**, it matters a lot to employers, and this further drives a stake into any GW Law student (or hopeful) thinking they can crack into Big Law.\n\nMy suggestion? GW Law should focus on its strengths and increase its reputation in those areas. We have a phenomenal government contracts program and are successful at placing many students in fed gov. Why we even *pretend* like we're Big Law-conscious is beyond me (though I understand why practically, as this makes us look more 'prestigious' - which, clearly according to the rankings, we're failing at).",

But the public recognizes Harvard as more prestigious. \n\nI get what you are saying but it doesn't really mean anything.",

To be more selective, you need stronger applicants. To get stronger applicants, you need to be more reputable. \n\nIf we don\u2019t consider improved education quality, then we will be waiting on some exogenous shock, like a hyper successful GW Law alumnus, to break the mold.",

You can improve the quality of education, yes; but, with a substantial number of contenders all doing the exact same, I don't necessarily see GWU ever really shifting up. \n\nOn the other hand, if you are purely looking at graduate universities based on reputation or social perception then I don't think you even have a CV to begin with (not you specifically). \n\nIn reference to the chicken and the egg analogy. I think that is definitely a way to look at it. But in a different POV, look at it like this: \n\nA business won't spend $10,000 on a new product line right off the bat. They will most likely sell a portion of the product through online sales in order to test the return value. GW Law is recognizable enough for applicants from the general GWU undergrad population, and other institutions to always fill the rosters. So why would they need to change anything if they are still able to charge \"x\" amount and get a hefty return? \n\nObviously though this doesn't change the foundation of GWU, education. \n\nDamn that was long as sh\\*t sorry.",

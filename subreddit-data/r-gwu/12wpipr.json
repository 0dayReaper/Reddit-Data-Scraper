But I hear from on campus people it\u2019s not that bad. When I was on campus w/ the dining money I loved it but I hear it\u2019s hot and cold with the dining halls\n\nGood thing I heard the SA is working on getting a grocery store to use your swipes on in the basement of district",

I would say it's way better than other schools, though I only tried the vegetarian options. Colleges are known for bad food, so you probably won't like it regardless of where you go.\n\nFood-wise, Tufts and Wesleyan are known for good food options. I'd say use Niche's website to see food ratings. Niche gave GW's food an A- ([https://www.niche.com/colleges/george-washington-university/](https://www.niche.com/colleges/george-washington-university/)).\n\nFyi, GW dorms are waay better than other college's since most were recently renovated. I don't think Niche updated it since they gave GW a B for dorms.",

The dorm situation was arguably what forced everyone online even in fall/spring 2020/21, distancing was \\*mostly\\* possible in the classrooms but people were extremely, extremely upset with the idea of sharing a room with a COVID-positive student. Maybe we'll see less of traditional dorms in the future.",

When they\u2019re so severe that they regularly kill their hosts, that\u2019s bad for the virus, because then, there are less hosts for them to live in. Instead, they evolve to become less severe but more contagious, so that their hosts are still alive and able to continue spreading the virus and so that the virus is easier to spread. Omicron is likely the beginning of this trend for COVID. It\u2019s a scientifically safe bet that it will be much less severe in a few years.",

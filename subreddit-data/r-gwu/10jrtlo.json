    "postText": "Hi! There was a GW email sent out saying that juniors don't have to live on campus next year (THANK GOD). I need to find a roommate for an apartment or if there are any rooms to rent (I'll pick up a graduating student's lease). Please let me know ASAP because my parents won't let me go off campus without a plan.\n\nI am a female and would prefer female-identifying roommates but am open to anything.\n\nAlso a bit about me: I am a neat person, do all my studying outside of the dorm, super extroverted and cook at home meals. I probably spend about 50-60% of my day in the house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Also, I am open to subletting for the summer on my own and then finding a roommate starting Fall 2023, but I need to know who that future roommate is and come up with a plan.",

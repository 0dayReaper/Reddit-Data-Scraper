    "postText": "I applied to GW on early decision and got in (class of 2027). I'm wondering if any current GW students had a hard time changing majors. Was the process difficult? I applied as a stats major and got in b/c I thought I could not get into SEAS. \n\nalso, this is very general and broad but if any GW students have any advice for freshmen, that'd be greatly appreciated :)",

So if you are admitted as a CCAS student (major really doesn\u2019t matter within a school), and want to switch to SEAS, you\u2019ll need to meet certain requirements. I believe SEAS in particular has a Calc 2 requirement but you\u2019d be best served by reaching out to a SEAS admissions/academic advising officer for more information about the process.",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm planning to apply RD for this upcoming admissions cycle, and I was just wondering what I could expect to get in terms of merit scholarship. I'm applying for CS, if that helps. \n\nGPA/Rank: School only does weighted, but I'm top-10% and have above a 4.\n\nClasses: Will have finished 9 APs and 2 DE classes by the end of my Senior Year.\n\nACT: 34 Superscored (35 E, 28 M, 36 R, 36 S)\n\nPretty good ECs, and my AP Lang teacher thought my CommonApp essay was pretty good. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ran the NPC and it estimated my net yearly price would be \\~39k. Just wondering if anyone had similar stats and got anything other than pure aid.",

I know the team here is strong, but I\u2019m worried that I wouldn\u2019t make the cut for it, which wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world or anything, but it\u2019d really suck. Can anyone on the team or familiar with it fill me in on how selective it is?",

From my experience (pre-pandemic) GWMUN use to be very very hard to get into, but now I know many on the team they seem like very chill people. Lots have changed since, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as competitive. Seeing that you have extensive experience, I have no doubt you\u2019d make the team.\n\nRegardless GW has many other MUN opportunities, WAMUNC and GWCIA are always in need of chairs and staffers, Strategic Crisis Sims are great if you love crisis MUN, weekly simulation practices and semesterly large scale events. \n\n I wouldn\u2019t put making the MUN team a significant factor for deciding GW, the benefits really are in the professional orgs and connections to the city\u2019s institutions. Actually go to the World Bank conference, or attend one of the constant special speakership that get invited to campus every week.",

            "comment": "Its fairly competititive. I applied and did not get in during my freshman year. Theres a written application, a 1 on 1 interview, and a mock GA. I believe the number of applicants they actually accept varies from year to year, but I would guess its around 30%ish. But as others have mentioned, there are plenty of MUN opportunities beyond being on the travel team. Ive been involved in staffing GWCIA (their middle school conference) and WAMUNC (High School Conference) despite not being on the team itself.",

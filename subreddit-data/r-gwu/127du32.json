            "comment": "honestly if it were anything other than engineering i'd definitely say GW. but GW definitely isn't known for its engineering program. I don't know how selective engineering jobs are, though, i'd imagine you do though. I think it comes down to what you prioritize in a school. Do you care more about the location and all the fun things you can do, or just about your specific program's ranking?",

            "comment": "I did mechanical undergrad at a large midwest state U with a good program. I think it comes down to 1. what you want to do during your degree, and 2. how much money you want to pay\n\nI might give GWU a bit of an edge in class quality - smaller classes, easier access to professors, but I have no actual experience to back this up.\n\nIf you think you'll be interested in joining student engineering teams, I have to assume that ISU will have more options and better quality. I have to assume that other opportunities in the department/school will be better as well (career support, interships, undergrad research opportunities, etc) - bigger dept = more options.\n\nIf you don't care as much about engineering stuff outside the classroom, and are more interested in spending time doing non-engineering stuff (music, outdoors, theater, food, etc), DC obviously has a big edge on anywhere in Iowa.\n\nCost: unless you have some weird situation, like out of state in Iowa and a crazy good financial package waiting at GW, I have to assume ISU is a much better deal, price-wise.\n\nPersonal experience: I sometimes wish I did my mech undergrad at a school with a smaller department (a la GW), but i wouldn't trade my overall undergrad experience in the end. \n\nOne more thing to think about - if you're doing mechE, there's a good chance you like to tinker around with things. That requires space - clubs, makerspaces, engineering teams. GW might have some of those opportunities, but DC doesn't have great makerspace culture as a whole, and I have to assume ISU will have way more options, easier to find.",

If you like sports/outdoorsy activity you'll have a great time, if you don't the campus is still large enough that you'll find your group. Ames is an alright town, even within Iowa I'd say Iowa City is a more fun college town.\n\nIowa does suck though, and you're going to run into a very specific type of whacko much more than you would at GW. I would recommend at least visiting to get the vibe.",

            "comment": "I got my undergrad engineering degree from GW, then went to a large Midwest school (Michigan) to get a master's and Ph.D. There were certainly times where I wondered if the quality of my education would have been better if I had gone to a school with a better ranked engineering program over GW, but ultimately, I enjoyed myself more being in downtt DC, and I think that because I was interested in advancing within academia, GW's professors were happy to extend opportunities to me that may have been more difficult to come by at a larger engineering program. Having those opportunities translated into experience that helped me to go to a top-tier graduate program, and would have translated into good jobs in industry if I hadn't gone to grad school.\n\nI was able to get a professor who did research at NASA Langley (Andrew Cutler, I thi k he retired last year) to let me work for him one summer. I'm convinced that having that on my resume helped me to get an actual NASA internship at NASA Marshall the next summer, which I think is connected to a recruiter from SpaceX calling me out of the blue in 2010 about a job. I was in the middle of studying for qualifying exams for my Ph.D., so I didn't follow that opportunity, but I'm not sure I would have had that opportunity had I gone to a large state school where it might have been more difficult to stand out.\n\nMy thought is that your undergrad institution doesn't matter very much (unless you're going to MIT or CalTech), but your graduate institution matters a lot. I'm not sure I would have gotten in to a top program for grad school had I gone to a larger undergrad program. Grad school may feel too far off for you to consider, but I will say that the kind of work you do with a Bachelor's versus an Master's in engineering should make you want a master's. You will have much more control over what you do, and be in a position that is likely more difficult to outsource or automate.\n\nAs for GW's campus, I'm not sure who told you it is desolate. It's not the same as most universities, but that's because it's in the middle of a major city. So it feels more like you're in a city than at a university. I will say, having been out of school for about a decade, when I'm back near GW, it feels different from other parts of DC. It's noticeably a college campus, but that could only have come with age and experience in other universities and cities. Regardless, either you like living a city or you don't. I certainly did.",

Particularly when it comes to engineering, you'll likely have similar proportions of national origins across the country. In other words, you'll probably be studying with a decent amount of Chinese and Indian students whether at GW or at ISU.",

The problem with your suggestion from their business perspective is that they would learn how many current/past customers don\u2019t care about colonials when they are solving for a future lost customer segment.  A bake off that includes colonials doesn\u2019t ensure reduced lost applicants that results in lower average applicant quality.  Current and past lost customers don\u2019t matter to anyone whether that\u2019s small or not.\n\nIf they want to sustain they should bias the approach.  Just good business and helps retain alumni degree value.",

                            "comment": "Your post doesn't reflect how they are making their decision. GWU says they are gathering feedback from students, faculty, staff and alumni. They are \\*not\\* polling the \"future lost customer segments\" that you mentioned, i.e. children who might apply to college someday.\n\nThere wasn't much fuss over the name until recently, and there may or may not be much fuss over it when the current generation graduates. My point was that these new names seem worse than \"colonials\" for enticing anyone to get excited over GWU. I say this as someone who thought colonials was an underwhelming name in the first place. The collection of new names and descriptions make the committee sound like they're really far up their own asses about it.\n\nKnow what does kill degree value? \"That place went downhill around 2015 and off the deep end around 2022-2023.\" \"I am not interested in participating in campus recruiting for my alma mater; the student body as a whole seems insufferable nowadays. I'd gladly interview the GW kids on an individual basis instead of as a target school.\" \"Maybe I won't stay as involved with my old team/club/fraternity/etc. this year.\"\n\nAlso, the technique of splitting the decision of \\*whether\\* to change apart from the decision of \\*how\\* to change is useful for making sure your stakeholders can't revert back when they find out how distasteful their new options are. Omitting the status quo from the decision pool would be unacceptable in most business settings, and is not common practice by real live consultants. I realize the university may believe the status quo is unacceptable, but this seems like a disingenuous way to claim support for whatever option wins.",

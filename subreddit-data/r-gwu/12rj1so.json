    "postText": "I'm undecided (probably between GW and Wesleyan). I got into the GW Honors College but don't know if I'd go there if I go to GW. How easy is it to find highly intellectual, engaged, deep-thinking kids at GW? Would the Honors College help with that? I have already have a main interest so don't feel like I would get much out of the additional gen ed stuff in honors (the amount in CCAS already feels like a lot to me...would take opinions on that too) but would go to the Honors College if the brightest/most engaged kids are there.",

            "comment": "The stance that many (not all) of my peers and I hold on the Honors College is that it\u2019s a lot of busywork for not a lot of benefit. Honors is selective so it\u2019s not unlikely that the students are of higher quality on average, but a lot of my brightest and most competent friends are not part of honors. Though to be fair, I only know a few honors kids so that doesn\u2019t mean much.\n\nAs for \u201chighly intellectual, engaged, deep-thinking kids\u201d, each class has some sprinkled in them but GW is more of a \u201cget stuff done\u201d  school than a \u201csit and ponder\u201d school like certain Ivies. It also depends on your concentration, some majors will inherently have more thinkers (econ, math, phys sci) and others will have more doers (business, cs)",

            "comment": "Very much agree with yellowrasperry. Id go further and say that if you come to GW, I would highly recommend you turn down the honors offer (don\u2019t get stuck on the Vern. It\u2019s not worth it) \n\nIn terms of elaborating more on the \u201chighly intellectual, engaged, deep-thinking students,\u201d point, those students will look very different at GW than at Wes. While Wes isn\u2019t in the middle of nowhere (ironically, is in Middletown), as a small LAC, you\u2019re much more likely to find that kind of student sitting in the quad reading and generally \u201cengaging\u201d with their coursework \n\nAt GW, those kids don\u2019t sit around reading and debating ideas (except for at philosophy club. 10/10 recommend that), but rather going to work on the hill, at thinktanks, various governmental agencies, directly in their industry, etc. It will probably be harder to find those students at GW because they\u2019re typically engaged with shit like that, but if you\u2019re one of those students, that means you\u2019ve got access to some of the best internships in your field. The nice thing about DC during the fall and spring is that there seem to be more internships available than there are students to fill them",

            "comment": "Graduated from the honors program. When I came to GW, I was unsure what to expect, but I highly enjoyed my time in the program. I loved the Vern, and also lived with the program my sophomore year before covid. The honors program is a tight knit community with amazing faculty, and some fun classes. It also gets you priority registration, which helped me a lot as a freshman and sophomore student. The curriculum is flexible so you can double count some classes from your major. The rest is philosophy based for the most part in the core classes, but there are lots of cross linked classes to get you out of your comfort zone. 10/10 would do again. PM me if you\u2019d like to discuss more.",

GW students can have those philosophical conversations for sure, but you're less likely to have pretentious pontificating than at other schools. GW student's BS meter is quite good.",

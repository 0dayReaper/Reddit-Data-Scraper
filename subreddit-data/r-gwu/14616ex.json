    "postText": "Hello all!\n\nI am considering applying for the online D.Eng in Cybersecurity Analytics from GWU. Paying for the degree out of pocket is not an option for me, so I am curious if it a graduate assistantship is awarded to all incoming doctoral students or is it competitive? Also, does being an online only student affect my eligibility for a graduate assistantship or campus health insurance?\n\nThanks bunches!!",

            "comment": "The short answer is no, it\u2019s not automatic and *can* be competitive. Graduate assistantships are awarded by each department, some have more funding/positions than others. There are two types of assistantships offered: graduate assistants (GA) who generally teach recitations/discussions, grade assignments, hold office hours, etc.; and graduate research assistants (GRA) who conduct research in a lab. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that explicitly prohibits an online student from being a GA or GRA, but I think it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019d award you one. But your best bet is to contact the department directly for more information on funding sources, GA/GRA and otherwise. \n\nAs for health insurance, you have to be an on campus student to qualify, online graduate students are not eligible. The exception is if you\u2019re awarded a GA/GRA, in which case you\u2019d be eligible",

    "postText": "Anybody staying in the area over the summer that wants a running buddy? I like to run the Mall (3-5 miles depending on route) and I usually run around an 8-8:40 pace, but I can slow down a little or try to speed up to meet someone else's pace. I'm not a hardcore runner or anything, just looking to stay accountable and enjoy the green of the Mall when it's nice out!",

    "postText": "I got accepted into GW with a 30k/year academic scholarship (so it won\u2019t lower with each year like financial aid). This is incredible and, after touring, I liked the school enough so I committed as an engineer under computer science. I did turn down higher ranked institutions that are known better for comp sci,  but I knew I wouldn\u2019t hate it here and the scholarship is really nice.\n\nBut please make me love this school. Tell me great things about it. Academically, student life, transport, opportunities anything.\n\nAlso, since I\u2019m already making a post, how difficult is it to find internship or research that\u2019s both *virtual AND paid*? This would be the dream internship for me.",

            "comment": "The great thing about GW is the access to faculty, guest speakers, and internship opportunities. Aka, the best thing about GW is it\u2019s networking potential. \n\nTo speak on your question about internships, while virtual jobs are great, I\u2019d really suggest against getting a virtual internship. It\u2019s not impossible to find them, but the whole point of having an internship (especially in DC) is for the networking potential, and that is significantly lowered if you\u2019re just behind a computer screen. \n\nEven if you get to work with a bunch of people online, you lack the ability to meet people who are walking through the office, coming in for business meetings, etc. You also build stronger relationships with in-person jobs. Just keep this in mind. \n\nOtherwise, going to GW is not worth it if you\u2019re not taking that active step to get your name out there.",

I really don\u2019t want to be coming into an office during the weekend. I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s really easy to have Fridays off so that would be a perfect day for internships.",

            "comment": "GW has a great location! The dc area is definitely an IT hub, so you have options to work for several contractors or consulting firms w a computer science degree (BAE, Deloitte, Booz, Mantech, etc.), tech/finance/other big private companies (capital one, microsoft, amazon, etc). The federal gov is also looking to desperately hire tech talent as well as surrounding local govs. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to find a paid virtual internship here.\n\nThe school itself is awesome! Had some amazing professors, love the friends I made through clubs, the dorms are pretty nice, and living in the city gives endless options for food (dc is known for great Ethiopian cuisine), museums, parks, art exhibits, embassy events, etc. GWU also has awesome guest speakers, even Stephen Colbert filmed an episode of his old show here.",

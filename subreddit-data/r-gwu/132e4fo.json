    "postText": "Our son is 48 hours away from making a deposit to attend college. GW is at the top of his list, but we\u2019re hesitating because of the 30% chance of him being assigned to the Vern. \n\nWe decided to see for ourselves how long the Vex ride actually is so we followed it from Mount Vernon to Foggy Bottom in evening rush hour traffic. It was well over 40 minutes. It sat in bumper to bumper traffic on Canal Rd for a painful amount of time. \n\nI know some students love it and that\u2019s great for them, but we are not interested in having our son commute to Foggy Bottom. \n\nSo\u2026has anyone figured out what the chances are of being placed there despite indicating on the housing survey that you do not want to be there? I know that 30% of the first years live there, but some actually choose it. What\u2019s the percentage that don\u2019t choose it but get stuck there anyways?\n\nAny foolproof ways to avoid it?",

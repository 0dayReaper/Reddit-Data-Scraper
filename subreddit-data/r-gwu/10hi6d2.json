    "postText": "Good news, every resident of Amsterdam hall. Since last semester, the water refiller on the first floor has said that it needed its filter replaced, but it hasn't had it replaced. With the filter not replaced, it's not only unclean water but the rate of water coming out is also super slow.\n\nTherefore, I have requested the school that the water refiller have its filter replaced. With new filter, we get clean water and faster water.\n\nThis is a W for Amsterdam. No longer will these people refilling their water bottles be damned from this refiller. Thank God and bless America.\n\n\\- a random resident in the hall",

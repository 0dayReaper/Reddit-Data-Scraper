    "postText": "Hi all! I was wondering whether it's worth applying to either Elliot or Columbian as my first choice and which one is more competitive than the other, I'm planning on EDing to GWU. I also plan on doing a double major in PoliSci/IA so I'm not sure which one would be more beneficial to me or if there's any negligible difference if I applied to Columbian or to Elliot, most of my extracurriculars are related to politics.",

As Elliott is smaller, their resources (particularly academic advising) are a bit better, but Colombian has more variety in terms of majors offered.",

I heard thurston is the best rn, and when I looked at the video, it\u2019s really nice! It must be the best looking one as of right now. However the semi communal bathroom part through me off, so I wasn\u2019t sure if it\u2019s much of a clean place or not, because I am a clean freak (kinda). Also, how is housing selected if not first come first serve?",

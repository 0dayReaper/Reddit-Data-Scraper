As for late dinning options, I recommend muncheez in georgetown (I think it\u2019s open all night or very late like 4am) but it\u2019s a bit of a walk or short Uber ride. Most dinning places in foggy close early with the exception of carvings, but I don\u2019t recommend. Try Uber eats or something",

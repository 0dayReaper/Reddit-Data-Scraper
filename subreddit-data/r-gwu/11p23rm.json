    "postText": "I was recently admitted into the MA program for Public Policy - Philosophy and Social Policy for Fall 2023. I received 45k from the funding offer, which includes a graduate assistantship and two fellowships. I filled out my FAFSA and I've been doing research on student loans, and I'm extremely worried about the cost of living (I will most likely do a part-time job while studying). Are there any Master's students on here with any tips regarding finances? How good are the work opportunities with an MA in public policy? Looking for any advice on how to afford this program while living in DC! Thanks!",

Especially if you don\u2019t tell them. \n\nAs for managing cost of living: roommates and/or not living near campus. Most grad students I know live out in Northern Virginia somewhere on the Orange/Silver/Blue lines and commute via Metro. The longer your commute, the farther your money will go. You can probably have a shorter commute with the other end of those lines in DC/Maryland but it\u2019s a bit of a sketchier area.",

In addition housing.  You can find studio apartments in Woodley Park for 1.5K a month.  In Clarendon/Ballston you might be looking closer at 2K a month.  In foggy bottom it's also roughly 2K a month.",

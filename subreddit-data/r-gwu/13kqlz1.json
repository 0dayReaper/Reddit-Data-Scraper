    "postText": "Basically I took IB Standard Level (SL) Chemistry and SL Economics, and the GWU site only lists credits given for the Higher Level (HL)  version of those courses (My school didn't offer HL Econ). Has anyone had luck/experience with getting at least SOME credit from SL scores and/or scores that are lower than what the website says is accepted (Ex: If I score a 5 on an exam and the site says they only accept 6/7, is it possible they could award me half the credit hours for a lower score?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance!!",

            "comment": "UW is *heavily* dependent on the professor, but also the semester. There are new topics every semester and a lot of the professors only teach for a year or two and then move on to other universities. You honestly don\u2019t know what you\u2019re gonna get, but try to pick a topic that you find at least somewhat interesting so if there are discussions it won\u2019t be too bad. They\u2019re also small classes so if you have public speaking anxiety it shouldn\u2019t be too bad.",

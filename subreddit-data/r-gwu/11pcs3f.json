            "comment": "It really depends on what you want out of a dorm - living on the Vern or Foggy is the first big question. If Vern, I agree with the other commenter that West is your best deal.\n\nIf Foggy, the options are much broader, and I'll speak to the ones I know about. \n\nThurston is the biggest freshman dorm, and the most recently renovated. It's a hub for parties, has one of the dining halls, and is a great place to meet people. The downside is that it's kind of a den of chaos and you don't have private bathrooms. It's also pretty far from the center of campus.\n\nMitchell Hall is the building for those who want to live in singles - no private bathrooms, and I don't recommend it for people who aren't extroverts or who aren't able to solidly find a friend group in clubs or organizations. Pretty far from the center of campus, but easy access to the 7/11 and Thurston dining hall.\n\nMadison Hall is much smaller, almost right at the center of campus, close to District dining hall and a short walk from the Shenkman dining hall, has private bathrooms. There are also communal kitchens on each floor (which is a feature of many freshman dorms). Whether it's a place to party depends entirely on who lives there - when I did, it was not a party spot. I've heard that's gone back and forth since then.\n\nLafayette, I gather, is a similar vibe to Madison Hall.\n\nI forget if Fulbright is still a freshman dorm - if it is, it's one of the few (if not the only one) that comes with kitchens in most, if not all, of the units. Great if you like cooking, but sort of a meh  deal with the new dining plan and Whole Foods dropping Gworld as payment.\n\nTL;DR: Foggy or Vern? Proximity to campus center? Private bathrooms or no? Answer these questions and you'll have some picks narrowed down in no time.",

A little closer to the edge of campus, but right near package services, right above a late-night food spot, and generally newer facilities. Private or suite-style bathrooms. I never hear anyone really complaining about living in Potomac so it's definitely a solid place to live! My first year, I sometimes heard it compared to living in a hotel. I don't know how much of that is still true, but take that as you will!",

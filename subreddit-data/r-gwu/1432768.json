    "postText": "Hi, I will start at GW as a grad student in Fall and I am currently looking for housing. I have found a couple of good places, but I was warned by someone that the ambulance sirens in Foggy Bottom are pretty bad. How true is that? I have my heart set on an apartment which is right behind the GW Hospital, but after this warning, I\u2019m not quite sure.\n\nCould someone who\u2019s maybe living around this area confirm? Thanks!",

But the nose is definitely something you get used to. The helicopter would shake everything in the room. But it\u2019s not as bad as you may think. If you used to noise it\u2019s not a problem.",

I did hate walking from behind because of the rats since that is where GW Hospital has its loading dock and trash containers but tbh rats are everywhere in the city haha",

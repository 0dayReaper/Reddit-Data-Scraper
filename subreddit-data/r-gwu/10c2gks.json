    "postText": "I'm taking Bio class with lab this semester and need a lab coat, but my budget is a bit tight this semester because of all the crazy textbook prices. Does anyone have a lab coat that I can borrow? My lab session is only on Tuesday. I'm 5'9\". I don't mind if it's a bit smaller or bigger. \n\nPlease please DM me if you have a spare one, I would greatly appreciate it.",

Goodluck finding a lab coat though!",

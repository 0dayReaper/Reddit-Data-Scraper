            "comment": "from what i understand about fws the money you earn through it is like already allocated to you, so whatever you earn doesn\u2019t count against you when you reapply for aid bc it\u2019s money you were expected to earn through your fws financial aid package. any money u earn outside of that while technically unrestricted is increasing your income and could theoretically reduce your aid, but for me personally it hasn\u2019t impacted me to such a degree where it matters bc i\u2019m not working full time or anything. it\u2019s up to you &amp; there are pros and cons for both, but a nice thing about fws jobs too is that they\u2019re not typically as demanding as some other jobs and give u more time and flexibility as a student\n\nedit: on the con side you most likely won\u2019t be working too many hours as i\u2019ve found they don\u2019t usually hire you for more than like 10-15 ish hours a week, so if you want to work more &amp; earn more you would either have to get another job or be willing to work two different ones. the lack of hours might also lead to you not being able to get the full amount of your fws aid by the end of the academic year if your job can\u2019t schedule you for more time",

            "comment": "it depends where you work but if you are using fws you are limited to the amount of hours you can do. if you only get like 1000 fws, you will only be able to make 1000 off the job and then you won\u2019t be able to work anymore (unless they offer to pay you non fws after). \n\nif your fin aid package is giving you a lot in fws it shouldn\u2019t matter but i knew some people who dealt with this because they worked a lot and then ran out of money like a month before the semester ended",

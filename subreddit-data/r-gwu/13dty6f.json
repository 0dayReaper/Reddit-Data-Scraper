    "postText": "All i want, literally all I want is reliable labels on the food. Not looking for anything insane. Just some basic i lngredient information. Does this contain dairy? Does it contain pork? At least tell me if it\u2019s chicken or beef?? \n\nWhat did i see when I got to the dining hall for lunch today? Literally not a single label on the food, just left over labels from yesterday\u2019s dinner and today\u2019s breakfast. That dish look good? Too bad you can\u2019t eat it because you don\u2019t know whats in it.\n\nWanna ask? The staff don\u2019t know. One day  i wanted to make sure that the sausages labelled vegetarian were\u2026actually vegetarian (because they sure didn\u2019t look it). What happened after i asked? The staff at the dining hall started question each other, no one could decide, until they eventually decided that, no, these were not vegetarian. The pork sausages were labelled vegetarian, and the vegetarian ones were labeled pork. Absolutely unacceptable. Truly fucking disgusting.\n\nEven when there is a label, the label\u2019s are useless. For ingredients they\u2019ll often just list the dish itself. Ingredients in the onion rings? \u201cOnion rings.\u201d  Like all i want to know is if dairy was used in them, but nobody fucking knows i guess?\n\nSorry for this rant, i just needed to complain to somewhere.",

It's a huge problem - and a bad look - for dining to literally have no idea what's in the food, especially to the point where the meat sausages masquerade as vegetarian.",

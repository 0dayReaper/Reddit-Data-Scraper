A situation may arise where the distinction between the threat to officers and students is blurred within a crisis and then the next day the judgement to use lethal force is questioned.",

The Maryland academies are POST Certified and MPD accepts the training as equivalent to their own in cases where Officers want to switch over or \"lateral.\"\n\nIt is also a lot more training than the rest of the campus police in DC go to, as they only attend CPSI.

You sure seem pretty gung-ho about not allowing officers to be armed to protect us, as do those protesting in the streets. First of all, GWPD officers are trained to the same standard as other local police departments. So if you aren\u2019t comfortable with any officers having guns, let\u2019s have that conversation. But personally, any gun violence on campus should be zero tolerance. What do you want them to do, try to calm down the active shooter? Or wait 15 mins for another police department with the exact same training. Think about the alternatives. And then think about the real risk of an accident. Whether they\u2019re idiots or not, they\u2019re not going to pull a gun on innocent members of our community, and if they do they\u2019ll rot in prison.",

Sure, many would, but the point here is that there is 0 liability for this on GW's end.\n\nStudents aren't getting shot it dorms, or at all for that matter, and shootings that happen near campus are in areas that already have armed police forces of their own- Metro PD, Transit PD, and Secret Service, to name a few. Adding more guns won't solve the problem. By the time GWPD respond to shooting events, a shooter will probably be long gone and then some. \n\nThe solution here is safety training for students (who want it) to educate them on best practice on times and places to travel, neighborhood safety, and self defense. \n\nGod forbid a shooting ever did happen on campus, I'd put good money on it being put to an end by Metro PD or USSS, not GWPD, even if they get guns.",

It's still talking about arming officers in educational settings specifically regarding decreasing incidence and lethality of mass shootings. It's not a perfect replication of course and there's a lot of further study to be done, but I wouldn't say it's completely irrrelevant to this conversation",

I have had friends die because of gun violence, and I have also had friends be brutalized by police. I have had friends be murdered. I have had police come through and get justice for some of the deceased, and I have also seen police fail and mistreat them and some police officers were even were the perpetrators themselves. All I'm saying is the assumption that guns automatically make things safer should be examined through empirical evidence and data rather than just assumed. If there is new data out that shows different findings in higher education campuses I am happy to review it and potentially shift my stance, I'm just showing that some preliminary studies raise some flags that are worth exploring. Idk if you've ever been affected by gun violence but after the initial shock and emotionality wears off you are left with the need to sort through the research critically rather than just having an emotion-based \"lets give folks guns\" response. (Granted GW is obviously doing a much more multifaceted and comprehensive response by working on alarm systems, notifications, mental health and DEI trainings, etc; I'll give credit where credit is due there). I'm not saying arming police officers at GW is an attack on the homeless or BIPOC students or whatever else is on those fliers, I'm just saying it would be helpful to see the actual data and academic literature on this based off of previous studies.",

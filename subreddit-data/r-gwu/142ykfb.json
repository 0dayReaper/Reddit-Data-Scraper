I'm hitting up tjmaxx and homegoods and getting everything for cheaper, and I already have a lot of that stuff in my house. For storage, decoration, and decorational storage, I'm doing the same thing. For a lot of their stuff, even Amazon is cheaper. Like the same caddy's and underbed organizers. For those, I have some good sized plastic bins from walmart that I'm gonna use instead of spending $15 on each plastic organizer.",

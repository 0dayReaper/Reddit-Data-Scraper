That, combined with some of GW\u2019s other social challenges has made it hard for a lot of people, myself included. But don\u2019t overthink it. If you\u2019re open to new connections and put yourself out there you\u2019ll practically be guaranteed to make friends at some point. People post when they have trouble/questions regarding social life, not when they\u2019re having fun so take what you see with a grain of salt.",

People were also very social in my freshman dorm (Thurston) and it was never difficult to find something going on! One of my favorite things about going to school in DC was the proximity of so many schools nearby. Georgetown has some super fun parties! Honestly there were times my freshman and sophomore year that I felt isolated, but if you put  some effort towards finding friends there are endless things to do in the DMV.",

I know everyone hates on it but the 8 or so people I met my freshman year on the Vern are the closest friends I still have \\~10 years later. It's a real bonding experience having to take that fucking bus all the time.",

This mostly applies to guys but girls will sometimes encounter it too but less so. So hit the ground running socially when you get here.",

People don't really talk to their neighbors in class a ton or anything like that. Orientation is a good time to meet people, and if you're social, you can definitely still meet people in classes and out and about. But I hit my stride by joining student orgs, where you start with at least something in common to talk about, which did the trick for me. Pretty much all of my friends on campus I met in student orgs.",

Did you do any work in hs or your home town related to politics? Did you work for a local rep? Bigger than that? If not then you are also behind a lot of freshmen? Are your parents rich and connected? If not then you are behind a lot more freshmen, and so on\n\nSo nepotism, previous experience or you get really lucky",

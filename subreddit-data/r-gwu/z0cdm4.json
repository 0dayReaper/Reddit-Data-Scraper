    "postText": "Im currently taking CSCI 6534 and it\u2019s currently kicking my butt. It\u2019s so weird, because my previous class was not this hard. None of my classes have given me this much headache. In fact, there seems to have been a significant jump in complexity from the class I took last semester, to the one I\u2019m taking now. I can\u2019t help but shake the feeling that I\u2019m missing information. \n\nI think I might be onto something, because the class I\u2019m taking next year is CSCI 6532 and then CSCI 6012. Shouldn\u2019t I be taking these classes in reverse, with me taking CSCI 6912 first and then CSCI 6534 at the end\u2026?",

The other classes I don't think have prerequisites.\n\nFor the other classes, it probably varies depending on your experience.  As an example, a lot of people could start with a summer session and get ECE 6132.  If you have no experience with Cloud Computing, it will be a hard class, but if you do, it will be a very easy class.",

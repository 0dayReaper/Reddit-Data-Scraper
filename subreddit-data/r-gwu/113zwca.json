But since you\u2019re in a large city with a lot of students and young people, you can just download tinder or grindr and have a fun time with people across the city.",

I wouldn\u2019t say we have an attractive study body. \n\nWhile I do know a few guys dating other GW students, many of my friends are dating girls from American.\n\nI\u2019m recently single and started going on dates pretty regularly and have begun to understand why other guys prefer other schools over GW, but it\u2019s certainly not as bad as some make it out to be. \n\nThe whole city is your oyster, there\u2019s a lot of options. My female friends have been complaining a lot about the dating market in DC though.",

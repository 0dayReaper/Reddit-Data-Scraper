    "postText": "Hey everyone! I have never lived in DC before, but I have received a nice financial aid package from GWU and will need to take out some loans to come to DC for grad school. I would love to hear the experiences of past alumni if they are apart of this reddit group. As well as my interest in Economics, I am also a classical pianist, love performing/visual arts, and enjoy studying languages (French and Japanese). I mostly want to know more about how I can make the most of my time here. I am also a bit scared that I will get started in the program and want to switch. That could just be me worrying too much. Anyways, I look forward to hearing what you guys have to say!\n\nAlso, coming from a lower rent area, the rent in DC is insane! Where should I even look to rent and how should I find a roommate(s)? Overall, this would be the biggest move I've done in my life thus far and it's pretty daunting. I stayed in DC last summer for a few weeks for a not so good internship, and the place I stayed in was roach infested...terrible. I want to avoid that at all costs!\n\nBTW I am coming from an undergraduate program majoring in International Affairs, concentration in Economics, and minor in French. Thanks!",

    "postText": "Current comp sci students, how would you describe GW's comp sci department? A few questions for you guys (as well as anyone else who might know):\n\n\\- Job employability?\n\n\\- Are the classes taught be good qualified teachers? \n\n\\- Is the curriculum specific and advanced? Rigorous?\n\n\\- Are there great research opportunities starting as a freshman/sophmore?\n\n\\- Is there great opportunities in DC for internships and networking in tech?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you! All help appreciated.",

            "comment": "fair warning, i am not studying compsci; i don\u2019t have the specific answers to your questions. that being said, consider what you value most about your future college. compsci is offered at most if not all dmv schools (umd has a particularly good program, so i\u2019ve heard). is gw worth the cost? would you receive substantial financial/merit aid? being in a large city like dc definitely has major benefits internship-wise, especially with tech in arlington. gw\u2019s compsi program is certainly not world-renowned, but most subjects here are at least *good*. consider other more affordable schools, too.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s a good but not great program. Your state school is probably just as good, and in the DC area it\u2019s a distant third behind UMD and GMU. I certainly wouldn\u2019t pay full price for GW\u2019s CS program over in state tuition at your state school, but if you get enough financial aid such that the cost is about the same, it\u2019s more difficult. The main advantage of GW is that it\u2019s a much smaller program so you won\u2019t be in CS lectures with 200 other students like at e.g. UMD, you\u2019ll probably have 30-40 people maximum and a much better chance to engage with your professors and lecturers. The flip side is that companies tend not to recruit from GW as much because it\u2019s relatively small. The company I work for (for example) spends most of our recruiting energy on UMD, a good chunk on GMU, and the rest at a couple of other schools where our founders and senior engineers went; we wouldn\u2019t turn down someone just because they went to GW, but neither do we actively recruit from here either. You can certainly get a great job or internship from GW\u2019s CS program, but you\u2019ll have to be a bit more proactive in going out and getting it. Another big con in my opinion is the lack of a formal co-op program \u2014 this kind of thing is really popular (and valuable) with junior/senior CS and engineering students, and GW is well behind the times by not offering it",

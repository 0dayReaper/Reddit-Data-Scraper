Decided to go meet her this afternoon &amp; I got there a girl opened the door and basically said \u201canother one\u201d and explained someone was pretending to be a girl online, and someone else had been there before. The account I\u2019d been texting with was deleted immediately after. \n\nWhat do I do about it though? This can\u2019t be allowed &amp; I wasted my entire afternoon taking a bus ride to the Vern, still on the way back. Maybe a legal recourse?",

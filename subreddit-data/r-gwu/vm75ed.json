                    "comment": "The selfish reason for GWU students and alumni to seek CT's removal is that the value of GWU degree is based on the continued enrollment of high quality students to GWU in future years.   If enrollment drops GWU will have to admit less qualified students to ensure sufficient revenue.  Less qualified students result in a perception loss regarding the quality of GWU degree.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGiven falling college enrollment in America that will occur for years (it takes about 18-19 years to make a college freshman except via immigration and birth rates have fallen) all colleges will be in a fight to fill classes.  Having a brand tarnished by a lack of ethics (i.e., failure to recuse himself on matters directly impacting his spouse) and restrictions of fundamental rights (strict textual interpretation plus history + traditions tests) will undoubtedly makes GWU a worse option compared to other Universities in the eyes of this and the next generation.  CT is part of a brand image problem GWU has with younger generations (e.g., colonials).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nrandom article on near term problem: [https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2021-10-26/college-enrollment-on-track-for-largest-two-year-drop-on-record](https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2021-10-26/college-enrollment-on-track-for-largest-two-year-drop-on-record)",

They gave the power back to the states and the people in EACH state. \n\nThe people you should be blaming are the Democrats for not codifying abortion when they had super majorities in both houses.  Remember Obama Care passing under a super majority.  Do we expel/remove all Democrats as well from GW?",

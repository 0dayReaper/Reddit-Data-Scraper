It depends on if you want good clothes (I'd go Arlington because it's where wealthier people live) or stuff for theme parties, costumes, etc (I'd lean the one by Costco).",

(There are 1 million people there)Otherwise, prepare to be hopelessly disappointed with the lack of thrift options. Some okay goodwill/equivalent near Alexandria, but if you actually want to thrift, go to Maryland, and have a car.",

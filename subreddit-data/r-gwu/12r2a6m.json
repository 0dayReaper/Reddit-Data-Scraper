    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman, majoring in econ and (maybe) minoring in sustainability or GIS. The classes I'm definitely taking are ECON1011, MATH1231, the freshman writing class, and the CCAS freshman experience thing. I'm looking for one more course, preferably 4 credits and something that meets a GPAC requirement. The options I'm considering so far are FORS2107 or GEOL1005. Any suggestions?",

            "comment": "I haven\u2019t taken FORS2107 but it seems really interesting and I am definitely planning on taking it eventually, plus the Professor seems really good. But, it seems like if you take GEOL 1005 it would count towards a sustainability minor so I would suggest taking that over FORS2107, but you do need two sciences courses as gpac requirements so unless you have transfer credit for a science you could do either and take the other another time. If you do have transfer credit for a science already, do GEOL 1005 since it would count towards a minor. Another thing I notice is that all the classes you are already set on taking are pretty beefy except the freshman experience. So you may want to take a course that would count towards your potential minors that really interests you and that may be more chill than a science with lab. Just things to consider, but if you feel like since you have the freshman experience class and that would be your light class and another already really interest you then you could roll with a science with lab",

                    "comment": "You make a good point, a lab science might be a lot to juggle with math, econ, and the writing course. The one thing that makes me think it'll be manageable is that math and econ will largely be review courses  (took IB courses, they don't take SL credit or credit for scores lower than like 6...). The topics in both courses are nearly identical to what I've done this year and last year in high school. I'm kind of leaning towards forensics because the class sounds really cool but geology does make a lot more sense so I'm pretty torn. With my math and econ being review, do you think a lab science would be manageable on top of all this? Or is there another class (or type of class) that might be better/potentially useful?\n\nEdit: I don't have a transfer credit unfortunately, they don't take IB SL Chem :/",

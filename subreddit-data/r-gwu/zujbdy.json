            "comment": "The biggest complaint I\u2019ve heard from my students is that GW doesn\u2019t really have a co-op program like those offered at other schools. These programs can vary from school to school, but in general you work at a tech company full time during the semester but keep your status as a student (e.g. university residence, dining plans, access to campus facilities) without having to take classes. That may just be a thing with my department or it may have changed since I last taught an undergrad course, but anecdotally the company I work for has had many co-ops from UMD and other universities around the country but never any from GW. \n\nAs for regular summer internships, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s at least a small advantage on paper coming from a school like UMD with a top 10(ish) CS program, but the reality is as long as you have decent grades and some projects you can show, you\u2019ll be competitive for internships regardless of what school you go to. GW students absolutely can get internships and new grad positions at places like Amazon and other big name tech companies. The main advantage of a larger/more well known CS program like UMD is networking with the smaller, less well known companies who will show up in force to their CS career fairs but might not consider it worth it to go to a smaller school\u2019s fair",

                    "comment": "Ah, yeah. I\u2019m also applying to schools like Northeastern where co-op is basically a selling point so I definitely get that. What I think could be really great with GW is the smaller student body population, as I\u2019ve heard complaints about how huge the student body population is at schools like UMD (5k CS undergrads or something crazy like that), meaning students get virtually no individual attention/help if they need it. GW seems like a better fit for me, and I feel like the reduced in-school competition could help in certain applications. Great location too, if I were to get an internship at Amazon, or any tech firm really, I couldn\u2019t imagine I\u2019d have to travel far if I wanted to stay near campus over the summer.",

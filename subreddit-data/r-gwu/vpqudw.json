We will do much worse, we will carry on as if the SA does not exist. By fighting them we acknowledge they exist, we will simply carry on and ignore them. And as we all know being ignored is every GW kids worst nightmare.",

In reality they are a group of ppl no one likes on a power trip. They really are only annoying of you are in a club and need funding from the school because you gotta go through them. Other than that they are just good entertainment and nothing more.",

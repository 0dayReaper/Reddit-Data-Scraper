I know a lot of IA students will do the econ-focused concentration and double major in Economics since there's significant course overlap. You could also tack on a minor in a STEM field like statistics, comp sci, or data science - they'll give you hard skills in programming + quant thinking that can set you apart from other applicants.",

Everyone I know that also did IA is in a wide range of fields and positions. Some went on to do a masters degree, some got a law degree, some did government agency work, election campaign work, and a few have jobs completely unrelated to their bachelors degree. Long story short the degree will help you ultimately get where you want to be but it might not be a direct path immediately after you graduate.",

And it\u2019s not directly in International Affairs. \n\nI interned for a Senator on the Foreign Relations committee and I was convinced I was headed for a career in diplomacy (but knew I needed an advanced degree). After graduation, I tried to get a job within the intelligence community, but wasn\u2019t able to. I ended up moving to NY and got my MA in Diplomacy from Seton Hall. At this point, I was horribly in student debt and realized that any entry-level job in government service wasn\u2019t going to pay me enough to make ends meet. \n\nThe good news is that skills you learn in diplomacy and international affairs translate well into other careers - like international business and communications. I currently work for a multinational bank leading external communications and media relations. I don\u2019t think my MA degree was necessary (and it was expensive) but my bachelor\u2019s degree and internship experience were worth it.",

I have friends who went to grad school, work for the fed government, Foreign Service, did Peace Corps, went to law school, private sector/contracting, or something totally non-IA related. \n\nI would just recommend taking advantage of as many different internships as you can. You\u2019ll get a sense of different paths and what you may want to do after. \n\nCareers are very often non linear. Very rare you get your dream job out of undergrad or grad school. Best advice I got was to understand that and think about how whatever job you\u2019re applying to will get you experience and skills that will get you to that dream job. \n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "&gt; What\u2019s the campus life like? \n\nSocial life for most people is based around clubs/students orgs/Greek life. I really enjoy that, but some people definitely struggle to find people to connect with\n\n&gt; Whats there to do during free time and weekends? \n\nMost of my friends spend most of their free time interning or working, with maybe a club or three thrown in there for good measure \n\nYou have an entire city of possibly out there, you can pretty much do anything you want. DC isn\u2019t NYC, but for the most part, the sky\u2019s the limit \n\n&gt; How often do students bond with each other through school activities?\n\nDepends on who you ask and what types of activities you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019ve been to one tailgate/basketball game, and it sucked so I\u2019ve never gone again. Some people really enjoy that and do that basically every week during the seasons \n\nMy social life is based around club sports (and a few other orgs), and most of my friend group comes from there. We party together, go out across the city, and do shit like that. \n\nA big part of the social scene at GW is off-campus (both literally in apartments in the foggy bottom/west end neighborhood) but then also at restaurants, clubs, and events across DC. Once you meet people doing stuff all over town, it\u2019s easy to get involved, it\u2019s just that the consensus seems to be that it\u2019s particularly difficult to do so at GW (I don\u2019t agree with that, and the Reddit consensus probably isn\u2019t representative of the average student, that\u2019s just what I\u2019ve seen a lot of people say in the last 4 years on this sub)",

It is not particularly difficult, you just need to make an effort.",

            "comment": "I'll disagree with the other poster, outside of a few niche clubs the club/org scene at GW is dead. 90-95% of the \"over 500 student organizations\" touted in marketing material don't meet. If you check on GW engage where clubs are supposed to post regular meetings, 3 do post and apparently like 3 more do hold regular meetings but you have to somehow find them and be let into the private groupme where they let their people know (?)",

BUT if you enrolled after may 22, 2022 it\u2019s just your gwid number. you use this to log in to blackboard and other gwu resources.\n\ngwu email: if you enrolled in gwu before may 22, 2022 it\u2019s the same as your user ID. if you enrolled in gwu after may 22, 2022 it\u2019s your legalfirstname.legalLastname or chosenfirstname.legallastname.\n\nfor your gwu email, you have @gwu.edu which is when you log in via microsoft. but to access google, gmail, gcal you change the @gwu.edu to @gwmail.gwu.edu.\n\nyou will also have a RMS ID which is your housing id number and is only used for communications with housing and housing applications or for joining a roommate group.",

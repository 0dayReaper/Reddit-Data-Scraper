Hillel spun this like people were protesting unprovoked when they invited a terrible person to talk which does show their bias\n\nSimply put, calling out the speaker for his harmful actions is not an attack on GW Jewish students. If they didn't want backlash they should've done their research. Yeah, it looks bad when people with f\\*ck Israel signs protest right outside of a Jewish space. But, maybe look at the context before screaming \"hate crime.\"",

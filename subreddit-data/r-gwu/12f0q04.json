    "postText": "hi! i was recently admitted to the gwsb and am trying to decide between the gwsb and rutgers business school. rutgers is about $10,000 less for my first year, but the cost is probably is going to become more as they don't really give merit aid while i did receive a lot of merit from gwu.\n\nis the gwsb good with getting internships and career help? i was also admitted to the women's leadership program in the global economics and business cohort, but i really hate how isolated it is being on mount vernon. is it actually worth it? i honestly don't even know if it's selective or not so i'm not sure if it really means anything.\n\nlast, i've been hearing very different things about the sense of community at gwu. some people say it's really hard to meet your people because gwu has no community and i'm a little scared about that lol. i'm not the most extroverted person but i think i'm outgoing. i know it depends on the person, but what is everyone's experience with that? i like going out, so is there much of a social/party scene within the campus?\n\nthank you for your help :)",

I think the lack of community that you're talking about is more about the lack of school spirit, I think there is plenty of community within GW. We don't have a football team so you don't get the traditional tailgating school spirit vibe. I will say the Vern has slightly more community, maybe attributable to the common enemy of the Vex or the fact that that campus is wayyyyyy more of a college campus with a traditional quad and brick buildings than foggy. They also do \"Escape the Vern\" every year which is wild and big bonding moment. The social scene is really what you make of it. People will be testing the waters with dorm \"parties\" at the beginning of the year while people start to acclimate to the atmosphere and find their niche (and wait for their fake IDs to arrive if I'm being honest), and frats will throw parties and events sometimes. I will say in general Greek life is pretty looked down on here, and there are so many stories of people being drugged and assaulted at different frats every year that honestly unless you're desperate for free alcohol and checking that \"college experience\" box of attending a frat party then you're better off doing things around the city. People will go monumenting a lot, fill a bottle with your beverage of choice and go frolick around the monuments late at night with your friends, which is fun and unique and cute pictures. Also we have so many cool bars and clubs and museums and dispensaries and activities throughout DC that anything you don't find on campus you can definitely just hop on a metro to find elsewhere. If you're outgoing it will be easy to find cool things to do every week with friends, there's plenty of fun stuff going on constantly:)",

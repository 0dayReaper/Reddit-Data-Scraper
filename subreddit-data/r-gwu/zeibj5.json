    "postText": "I'm an high school senior, and planning to major in English and Literature. I want to apply for the Fall 2023 semester, but I don't know if I can get in. My GPA isn't really the highest (3.1), and I want to major in political science. Freshman year I messed up terribly and I've been trying to get my GPA up. Junior year last year I got all A's (and some A-'s) for the whole year so that helped a lot, and I'm trying for that again. I have an extra-curricular centered around helping out in the community and school district that I have been doing all four years of high school. I was also in an internship as a student teacher cadet during the summer before senior year. Basically we walked around the classrooms during summer school and helped kids understand what was being taught to them. I was on the swim team, too, just in my freshman year though. Bec of the internship, I made a resume and I included my monetized blog on it as well. I also got a 1010 on the SAT.",

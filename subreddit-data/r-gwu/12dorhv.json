    "postText": "so i did room renewal for my housing a few months ago, but i just realized my assignment for next year isn't listed anywhere in my CLRE e services portal. i do have an email, though, stating that if i did room renewal that the email serves as \"reassurance\" that i'll be in the room next year. there's a link in the email to view my housing assignment but it doesn't link to anything saying that, just the homepage of the clre e services portal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nshould i email housing or am i fine?",

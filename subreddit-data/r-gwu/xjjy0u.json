Some of the courses you are taking now will likely apply to your electives' credits.\n\nExtremely likely you won't have to take an extra year, but might have to squeeze in one or two extra classes in the summer if you want to \"catch up\" to your years' progress since some prerequsites may only be offered in the Fall.",

    "postText": "I have big aspirations inside the international affairs field, and I got into BostonU and Emory. However I really feel like I should be in DC for networking and internships because I want to be in the best shape possible for IR career outcomes. I\u2019m really upset at myself for not applying to GW but looking at the transfer rates, it looks like it\u2019s fairly easy getting in. Is it worth it to transfer out of either BostonU or Emory (haven\u2019t decided where I\u2019m going yet) to go to the Elliot school? I\u2019ve also heard the Elliot school kinda has a pipeline for State Department/CIA jobs which is def where I\u2019m aiming to be, however I don\u2019t know how true that is. I\u2019ve heard a lot of negative things about GW over the years which kinda deterred me from applying, but besides all those things, it seems to be the best place to be for IR along with Georgetown\u2019s SFS. Or should I just wait until graduate school to be in DC and enroll at one of my two options? Any thoughts are much appreciated!",

If GW\u2019s going to be twice the price (I\u2019m not sure if GW\u2019s already limited aid is great for transfers), maybe you stick with wherever you end up \n\nBut if you\u2019re serious about IA/polisci and fedgov work *and* you can go to GW for a comparable price (or even cheaper), I think elliott is a no-brainer",

It is true Elliott is great for state and IC, def Elliott 110%. It\u2019s got the location, job placement, professors, and name recognition. IA is a hyper competitive field as you know; the connections you make at Elliott make it easy mode. Sincerely, a business student who wasn\u2019t even in Elliott but got into IA fields just by visiting talks there and making connections",

People's minds are out of pandemic mode for the most part and people in pretty much all political factions at this point think dragging this out is empty-headed, so this only works to piss people off. I honestly hope admitted students pay attention to this because this demonstrates GW's attitude to the pandemic and I can say most students at this point want a normal college experience and don't want to continue living in crisis mode. I think a lot of students are thinking why go here when I can go somewhere that isn't still freaking out about this.",

That\u2019s the point of the vaccine, so we can get back to our normal lives without worrying about the severe effects of covid. People are going to get infected, yet they won\u2019t experience terrible effects because of GW\u2019s vaccine requirement. Hundreds of people still got infected with the mask mandate, and without it the test positivity rate didn\u2019t spike more than would be expected following spring break. Masks change nothing when the vast majority of the campus interacts without them off-campus on a daily basis",

They WERE effective. We\u2019ve gotten vaccines and boosters in the past 9 months and seen its efficacy to be proven in the last two. So until cases jump up even 3 fucking percent given people\u2019s current vaccinations it\u2019s inane to think wearing masks is any real help besides to sate paranoia in people like yourself. Also, despite new COVID cases there have not been more than maybe 10 total deaths in DC since December. \n\nBy the way, derailing the discussion by bringing up an Internet stranger\u2019s credentials and character doesn\u2019t prove you have a decent rebuttal.

Your making it sound like there is some trade off between not having masks and people dying- there is not. The numbers are about 1 or less than 1 in 100k in the US. Specifically looking at old and sick populations you are looking at death rates with several 0\u2019s after the decimal point when they get the booster. That comes down to margins of error and external circumstances. Not wearing a mask isn\u2019t doing that. Everything we do has risks and we accept it. Less than 1 in 100k is a risk I\u2019m ready to live with, we accept other risks far greater than that. I would have empathy for boosted people who die but they simply are not dying.

The our world in data I added after which u may not have seen (that\u2019s my bad) is a bit more recent. That is common for studies to be behind, it takes time to do a good study. Also I\u2019m not talking about cases of covid, that 1 in 100k is deaths I was talking about deaths of those with boosters (ie. those at GW) not just getting the virus. I reference booster only because that is what the GW community is so that is the relevant data. But either way the vaccine is a choice- if a person chooses to not get the protection of the vaccine that\u2019s fine but I should not be guilted for the result of their actions. Look clearly we are on two different grounds we aren\u2019t talking about the same things. I\u2019m gonna just leave this as my last comment. I hope you have a good day.",

But you've already given up a year of YOUR life, so the thousands of staff that are there to support you and your success and, heck, the DC community that you joined when you decided to attend should just sit back so you don't have to do something as simple as put on a mask.",

Granted I used a testimonial in my GW example, but the average roughly 1.5% positive rate supports that and so does CUA\u2019s only 0-5 total cases per day (students and staff together). Positivity rates and news feeds are much more telling. I don\u2019t think schools publish staff info for privacy reasons, but there just isn\u2019t some mass illness of staff occurring- because the booster works!!!! I am very grateful for staff and would be concerned if some mass illness overcame them, but that\u2019s just not showing in the numbers or being reported by the schools- because they are all boosted and studies consistently show the booster provides excellent protection.",

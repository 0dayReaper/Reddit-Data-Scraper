That covers like 90% of the museums in DC, most of the rest will have a student discount but they\u2019re not completely free",

One of the major perks of living in DC is having free world class museums. \nThe Phillips and Kreeger collections are also good art museums, not free but not too expensive either",

I\u2019l also add the spy museum is very interesting and is not free but has discounts for students. The Udvar Hazy center is free and great if you can make it out there.",

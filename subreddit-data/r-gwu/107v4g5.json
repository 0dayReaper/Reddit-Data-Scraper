Enjoy the grind. Meet many interesting people found nowhere else. This is a cool for strivers so embrace it and you will make friends along the way.",

            "comment": "You'll only be able to get free housing if you work for GW for a substantial amount of hours. Also echoing the sentiment of getting out of the foggy bubble. Another thing I realized when I came to GW is just how hard it is to navigate the sense of entitlement of all the kids here with mommy and daddy's credit card and how much cost can be a factor in accessing fun and activities here. Bars and clubs and activities are expensive and most GW kids are here on their parents dime and don't have to weigh financial decisions like this and it can be easy to get resentful of your peers that don't have to work and make these decisions. It would drive me crazy hearing people whine about being a student when they don't even have a job to juggle as well. All that to say it's really helpful to make a few friends that are in a similar financial boat to you. Not to say you shouldn't branch out, but only dealing with the spoiled rich kids of gw gets old quick.",

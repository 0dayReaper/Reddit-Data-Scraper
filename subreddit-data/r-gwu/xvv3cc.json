You pay for tickets, visa, food, everything else (all the non-billable expenses) on your own. \n\nIf you\u2019re doing a GW exchange program, you\u2019ll pay tuition + 1.8K tier fee and housing is not included\n\nThere are scholarships now available through the office of study abroad if you\u2019re interested! \n\nhttps://studyabroad.gwu.edu/costs-tier-fees\nhttps://studyabroad.gwu.edu/osa-scholarships",

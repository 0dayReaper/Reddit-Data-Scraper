By firing all the administrators and creating a commune? Turning 7 competitive sports into club sports sucks, but is *way* better than more layoffs.",

A lot of universities didn\u2019t do part or any of that list at all. \n\nThe public health situation is always invoked in a such a bad faith way by critics. When GW considered re-opening partially in the Fall, everyone cried about how this would create another hotspot in DC, how it would harm the actual residents in DC, how it completely ignored the fact that a pandemic was happening, yet for some reason it would\u2019ve been okay for GW to welcome thousands of people back to campus from every state, to use the same crowded hallways roads to get their items, before returning to their home states right after. It would\u2019ve been a fine solution for the wealthy New Jersey students, but a rotten deal for everyone else. \n\nGW is actually the second largest landholder in DC, after the Feds. They do have assets, but they aren\u2019t particularly liquid. You can\u2019t pay people in bricks taken from Thurston\u2019s construction site.",

This is EXACTLY why I don't give money to GW. \n\nThe university is run with the same ruthlessness as a publicly traded business, and it's SHITTY. I get that higher education is tough, but GW has not done anything to engender goodwill that didn't have a dollar sign attached to it. They'd rather cut a program to save a year's worth of salaries, rather than taking a hiatus on all programs and supporting their employees, or even just offering a furlough and keeping health benefits. \n\nI don't give money because of every time I was nickel and dimed as a student. They showed their true colors when they rolled out the red carpet for prospective students and parents but couldn't be assed to fix sophomore dorms. When I tell people that went to other schools that it used to cost $5.50 an hour to play ping pong *in the student center* I am met with disbelief, but that's so minor in the GW experience as to not even be questioned.\n\nThe closest thing I saw them do towards building a better community in my day ('05-'09) was when they increased fraternity housing and involvement...but that was because a recent study had shown that Greeks gave the most money out of all all alumni. Up until then they were actually anti Greek.\n\n...and I realize it's been a while, so maybe GW is doing a better job these days with making their students feel like *students* and not tolerated customers/revenue streams, but this news doesn't make me hopeful. If they can't take care of their staff, if they keep turning to adjuncts because they're cheaper, if they *continue* to take actions where the only motivating factor is the bottom line, I will continue never giving them money.\n\nIt's crazy, because we got a new rowing coach this spring, and other rowing alumni and my wife were starting to warm me to the idea of giving some trial money, earmarked specifically for rowing of course, if things looked good. Thanks GW for reminding me of what really matters to you, and ensuring another decade of not having to worry about donating.",

Firing some administrators and overpaid deans would send an even better one.\n\nI get that they're in a tough spot, but that's not really the point of my polemic. The problems with GW did not start with COVID. These cuts are a symptom of a much more pervasive problem - they run the school like a business, with flash and PR more important than substance. It reminds me so much of my time at IBM. Keep riding what name recognition you have and milk people who fall for marketing.",

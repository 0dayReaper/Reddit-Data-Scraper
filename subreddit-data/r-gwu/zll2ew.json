    "postText": "Hello! I applied as a transfer student for Spring 2023 and on the website it says that transfer decisions usually come out early December. I have yet to get a decision yet and am a bit nervous. I applied to the School of Business just for some background context. I was wondering if this is the same for other transfer students who have applied? Are we all waiting on decisions?",

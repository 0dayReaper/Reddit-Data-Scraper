I am a sophomore (possibly junior credit wise will have to check-but doubt that counts) and my dorm has a kitchen so the dining plan isn\u2019t super necessary for me. However, knowing GW and their need for money, I doubt it\u2019s possible that I can get out of it, but was curious if anyone had any luck getting out of theirs.",

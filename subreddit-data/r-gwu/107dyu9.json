I am curious as to whether removing myself from the course is my own responsibility or whether it would be automatically done by the teacher.\n\nI am currently still enrolled in all of last semester\u2019s courses.",

You can do this both on the website (click the settings icon in the corner of the area where your course listings appear and uncheck the old classes. It's also good to make sure all your new classes are checked) and in the app (go to courses, scroll to the bottom where it says \"you have __ hidden courses\", click that and then click course listings to toggle show/hide).\n\nHope this helps!",

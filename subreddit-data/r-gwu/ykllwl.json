The latter because I knew I'd want to get into triathlon after college but didn't really know how to swim competitively, and the former was really good for...extracurriculars. I know you said humanities, but don't sleep on Phys Ed. They used to offer a bunch of great classes and if they're still around I'd look into them. Stuff like sailing, there was a camping class, I took SCUBA and fencing, and racquetball was one of my favorite classes ever. Lots of stuff you won't have time or money or an easy intro to do as a working adult.",

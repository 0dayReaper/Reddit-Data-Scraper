    "postText": "Hi! I was just admitted to the GW class of 2027 beginning in the spring semester. I\u2019m super interested in the school &amp; will most likely attend pending the financial aid I am given \n\nMy main concern is socializing &amp; making friends while entering in the second semester. I know peoples first semester friend groups are almost certainly subject to change in college, but im worried about finding people to hang out after missing the entire first semester \n\nAny advice on how I would be able to make friends/if this is even a thing I should worry about is greatly appreciated :)",

            "comment": "Hi! I'm a spring 2026 student, we were the first class for this to happen to so I totally get your concerns, and after being here for a bit they are valid. You definitely still can find friends but it's a lot harder, and overall there's a general sense of being socially and academically behind- it's an adjustment for sure. \n\nJust as a heads up! This is separate from the social issue and I pray that GWU fixed this- but the spring admit system is a mess, and you will get lied to and mistreated. GW is a great school but the administration is horribly run, there's tons of wrong info given by actual school officials, housing, etc. And besides that, being a spring admit student feels very weird and different. All I'm saying is if you want something closer to a normal college experience and there are financial barriers (Gdub is very pricey even after tuition and such) I would consider other schools if you have a close second choice. \n\nI am happy at GW as a spring student and yes I did eventually find friends, but all the BS it took to get here is almost not worth it. Just weigh your options carefully and know that friends are not the biggest concer- you will def figure that part out when you get here :)",

                            "comment": "Well the first communication we actually ever received from the university was 4 months after accepting our spot, and that email was someone saying that other spring admits created a group chat and she shared the link, and then also she was quitting so she couldn't help us anymore. When I made appointments with advisors, told them my potential majors, etc. they advised me to just \"travel europe instead\" and couldn't give me guidance on what classes to take for the Fall. When I asked if there were any study-abroad opportunities for the fall semester they said no. In all of the emails asking them dates for housing registration or online orientation, there were multiple times when they referred us to different offices, who referred us back to them, and they told us the wrong dates. In our zoom orientation call, the slide presentation had fall dates, and the spring ones weren't even uploaded yet, so they edited them during the presentation, which a lot of them were later wrong. For housing, they said we would pick November 1st. Then on November 1st it wasn't open, they told us it was actually November 15th and that the Fall students got to re-pick housing before us. They also were caught lying about other dates as well. We didn't get any extra financial compensation OR any merit-based scholarships or aid, because it was all given to the fall students- so there's that. Even during our orientation, they said they would provide us lunch then didn't, then advised us to go to the dining halls which were closed, and also much of the information they told us there was false and the students corrected the presenters. \n\nTheres a lotttt more but those are some highlights off the top of my head :)",

And like maybe the Paris Scholars Program is a good option but again they never offered ANY resolutions to us, like none. We had to fight tooth and nail for any helpful info and like go gaslit by them, nobody knew what they were doing. I hope it's better this year but like even today I learned more info about why people were even put in spring in the first place and it made me more pissed.",

It was only 80 of us too so we think it might have been a housing issue, at least that\u2019s what we\u2019ve heard. But we also heard based on the NYU program that spring students are \u201chigher risk students\u201d and don\u2019t get compiled into the 2022-2023 admissions cycle data, even though between all the spring admits I know, there is no commonality that makes us high risk. So I think it\u2019s the housing thing. The whole thing is a money making ploy regardless.",

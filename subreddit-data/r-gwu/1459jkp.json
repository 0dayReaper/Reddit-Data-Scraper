    "postText": "My daughter is an incoming freshman for Fall 2023. They told her to come to her appt with her freshman advisor with her desired schedule and some alternatives. She knows she needs to take First Year Writing (UW 1020), however, when we go to the Fall 2023 class schedule all the 1st Year Writing classes are located on Mt. Vernon classes. Is this typical? Do they not reach this class on the main campus? \n\n[https://my.gwu.edu/mod/pws/courses.cfm?campId=1&amp;termId=202303&amp;subjId=UW](https://my.gwu.edu/mod/pws/courses.cfm?campId=1&amp;termId=202303&amp;subjId=UW)",

A majority of the classes will be main campus (foggy bottom) where everyone has classes, while a select few allotted to freshman will be on the Vern. I have never taken a class on the Vern in my four years.",

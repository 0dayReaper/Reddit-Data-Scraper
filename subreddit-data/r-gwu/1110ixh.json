    "postText": "I know some students in this school love to major in both political science and international affairs, but what exactly is difference between these two areas? Does political science specifically aim at American domestic politics? \n\nAlso, how often do you talk to professors during office hours? Does talking to professors frequently help you get recommendation letters easier? Or does not make any difference at all?",

            "comment": "Political science does not specifically aim at American domestic politics. There\u2019s a wide array of international and comparative politics course in the PSC department. I chose GW for the American politics courses but left out falling in love with comparative politics, especially Latin American, Russian, and Korean politics. We have some political economy courses as well, both comparative and international political economy. Personally not my favorite courses, but still an option. It\u2019s not just all American politics, trust me. Branch out and you\u2019ll find something completely different that you\u2019ll end up loving that you didn\u2019t before.\n\nTo your second question, absolutely go to office hours with your professors. Engage in class, and enjoy what you\u2019re studying. Take multiple classes with the same professor. They\u2019ll know you, and that will help greatly with letters of recommendation. Professors Betz, Nicole Bartels, and McClintock were my absolute favorites to take classes with. Professor McClintock only offers 2 courses in the august and fall, while Professor Betz teaches multiple courses each semester. Get to know your professors. Not only will they be willingly to write letters, they can make really great friends. I\u2019m currently studying abroad, and absolutely miss my professors at GW. They really do care about you, you just need to care about them. \n\nHope this helps man. Cheers!",

I used to to my Cybercriminology professors office hours every week and talk about the most recently watched episodes of Black Mirror or interesting news headlines or anything that is tangentially related to class even if I didn't have a course specific question. I was the only one who ever really showed up to his office hours and he was thrilled to have the company and get to talk about something he is passionate about (cybercrime in the media). Obviously don't just go and chat if it's a packed class where everyone is needing time to address course specific questions, but if its not a busy office hours that's the perfect time for networking. Also most of the profs here, especially the ones in international affairs and political science, have some crazy real world experiences and backgrounds and love to talk about it. You can pick profs brains about their experience at the State Department, or writing speeches, or diplomacy abroad, etc. etc. Def take advantage of office hours!",

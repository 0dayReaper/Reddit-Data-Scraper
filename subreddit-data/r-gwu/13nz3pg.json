Email them and request a copy of the FA22 syllabus to get a better idea of what the course looks like. Some faculty are good about supplying a copy, if you ask them. \n\nThis course has been historically taught by faculty with a strong background in business ethics--current theories as well as moral philosophy (Ancient, modern)--and you work by engaging with theory and responding to case studies. But each professor may do different things.",

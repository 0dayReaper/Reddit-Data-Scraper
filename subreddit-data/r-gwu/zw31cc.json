    "postText": "'Twas the night after Christmas\n\nand when all through the house,\n\nNot a creature was stirring,\n\nexcept for me, because I refreshed ban web and discovered my D in my crappy intro class which promptly dragged my GPA to a 2.8. In a panic, I researched the minimum GPA needed to keep my presidential scholarship to confusing results.\n\nBy word of mouth from other students and my parents assumption, the minimum was a 3.0.\n\nAnd yet...the evidence pointed in the contrary, a 2.0.\n\n***Possibly important points for consideration (?)***\n\n* I am a freshman who just finished my first semester\n* I am in the business school (international business major and finance minor)\n\n1. **Exhibit A: the website**\n\nAccording to websites, the minimum requirement is actually a 2.0\n\n[Link to said article](https://financialaid.gwu.edu/policy-satisfactory-academic-progress)\n\n*\"Undergraduate: Students must maintain at least a 2.0 grade point average (per semester, and cumulative after the second academic year), pass at least 75% of credit hours attempted each semester, and complete their academic program within 150% of the published length of their academic program.\"*\n\nBut the website is confusing on it's definition of the different types of financial assistance, for example, is it talking about the need based aid? Perhaps thats simply my ADHD kicking in when I read it and it's not entirely clear.\n\n2. **Exhibit B**: **Banweb AKA Gweb**\n\nWhen scrutinizing my letter of acceptance (I am a freshman) It lead me on a hunt which eventually yielded the following image:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The image in question on banweb](https://preview.redd.it/4vczixhmcc8a1.png?width=1154&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=acbdaaff3da68f2c04547f8df6cb0b7eac57e7bb)\n\nNow, this would appear to be definitive evidence if I didn't find evidence pointing every other way\n\n3. **Exhibit C: A Hatchet Article**\n\n[Link to said article](https://www.gwhatchet.com/2020/02/27/provost-floats-policy-to-raise-minimum-gpa-for-merit-aid/)\n\nback in the youthful days of 2020, the hatchet published an article discussing **raising the minimum scholarship from 2.00 to 2.7 ish for merit scholarship.**\n\nI couldn't find anything from the Hatchet saying that they did raise it and I doubt it was real high on the priority list after cause a month later Covid happened.\n\n*So why the Ban web message?*\n\n**4. Exhibit D (twinning with my grade): student stories**\n\nWhen previously expressing my fear back in November about this class dragging down my GPA, a friend assured me that GWU didn't really care if you got below a 3.00 as long as it was above a 2.00.\n\nOn this very sub u/HistoricalGas9634 expressed \"*I'm not sure, but I think its actually a 2.0 because others in the past have told me they have failed classes and gotten below a 3.0 and they still kept their scholarships. I'm pretty sure GWU doesn't care that much about grades so its a 2.0 requirement.\"*  upon another students question.\n\nCould it be that GWU doesn't even know it's own policy?\n\nCould it be that I read every article entirely wrong?\n\nCould It be that doing this very minimal research is making me go slightly insane?\n\nBut thats actually from being with my family over winter break...\n\n*Anyways...*\n\nIf you are on the same predicament as me, have no fear or at least less fear because even if you did dip below the unknown minimum I'm 90% sure you'll go on probation for a semester but even then GWU is inconclusive on weather you can get all of your scholarship back\n\nOn the website\n\n*\"instatement of GW undergraduate student financial assistance is based on availability of funds. Financial aid/scholarships, once lost, cannot be reinstated retroactively for previous semesters\"*\n\nHowever, other people have said they go their aid back completely??\n\nAt this point, who really knows and now I have a headache.\n\nCheers.\n\nLastly,\n\nAnyone have any stories about their probation? I would love to know more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR; GWU is super unspecific about their presidential (and general) merit scholarship minimum requirement and I can't find a conclusive answer anywhere.**",

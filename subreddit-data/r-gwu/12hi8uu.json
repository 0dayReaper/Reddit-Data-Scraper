In terms of Public health programs, GW is better, but it does not have the same sports or community that WF does.",

Also, if the parents are footing the bill (possibly quite a large one at these schools), then they are smart to do their own due diligence and help their son make what could be a huge financial and life changing decision.\n\nYou are very right that the college experience of these two schools is very different. Wake is much more traditional campus and school spirit vibe, while GW is much more of a young professional career focus from day 1.",

Winston Salem is beautiful but students spend most of their time on campus and the school has a great school spirit and heavy emphasis on sports. WF is also historically a Baptist college, whereas GW has no religious affiliation presently or historically, and as a current student, I would say no religion dominates campus culture or drives the overall culture of the university. GW is substantially integrated with the city and students are very independent and career driven. Sports is not a main pillar of student life for every student at GW, though there is a growing presence for those who choose to participate. It\u2019s truly up to each person in what culture they can seem themselves thriving in!",

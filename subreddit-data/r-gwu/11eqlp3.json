    "postText": "So I\u2019m a spring admit. Did a semester of community college and had a 3.8. But since getting here I\u2019ve just been absolutely miserable - I have one friend. I\u2019m in organizations so that\u2019s not the problem. It feels like everyone already established their friend groups in the fall, and now it\u2019s too late. I\u2019m also massively struggling with the coursework - I feel like I can\u2019t keep up, like I lack direction. I\u2019ve tried going to office hours and it doesn\u2019t feel helpful. I know it\u2019s probably wrong, but at this rate I just want to go home for spring break and not come back. I\u2019ve gotten severely depressed and it\u2019s gotten to the point where I don\u2019t want to go to sleep at night because I know I\u2019ll have to go class the next day. I even feel suicidal - I have a history of mental health issues but have been pretty stable for about a year now, but now I\u2019m really struggling again. I seriously just don\u2019t know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated.",

I just solo dine at dining hall lol. I was really struggling like you too and thought I was not doing well. But I just started to focus on myself. Having time by myself allowed me to go to dining hall anytime I want or go to fitness center, instead of asking someone to go with me. Every Friday, I either go to Constitution Gardens(really nice, quiet park) or Potomac River(there\u2019s a nice trail from Waterfront park to Kennedy Center). \nGetting Sunlight by walking those area and listening to music really made me feel relaxed. Just like placebo effect, I keep telling myself \u201cthis is relaxing\u201d everytime I go there lol. \nI can\u2019t really give much advice on making friends because I\u2019m obviously anti social but I can tell you that  you are okay and you are not behind everyone. I am so proud of you that you are enduring really well! I don\u2019t think I had the courage to tell anyone about what I am going through. Although this will not end in a day or two, it will be over and bright days will come. I hope this was helpful. Don\u2019t give up!",

There is no such thing as perfection\n\nYou are struggling with a few things all at once, but loneliness seems the biggest issue.  So, reaching out to others helps.  Pick up the phone, and talk to your oldest friends, or someone from your old school.  Just talking helps.  And take advantage of mental health services if you can; it helps.\n\nMaking friends doesn't happen instantly.  It takes lots of time with other people to really connect with them.  Keep involved in your groups.  And don't be shy about talking to new people.\n\nOne thing about GW is that there are endless things going on: speakers, debates, political activism, clubs, concerts, events... and for some of them flying solo is easy.  Then it's easy to talk to people you don't know as you know you share at least one interest.\n\nIt's tough to get settled in a new place, but you will.  Don't put pressure on yourself, just try to accept what is.  And Spring is coming... soon everyone will be blinking in the daylight and digging out their shorts.  That's your chance to invite new friends to learn hacky sack or ultimate Frisbee.  This is a great time in your life, and GW is an amazing place to be.  Try to remind yourself of that, and keep swinging.  Good things will come to you.  Good luck!",

Relish alone time and get in touch with yourself! Not having friends is honestly the way to go imo. U can always go out alone and meet ppl like that. Parties here are lame anyways",

Then I feel like I'm spending so much time on coursework, so I can't justify hanging out with people. Then I get into a vicious, isolating cycle. It's terrible.\n\nSo I'm going to tell you what I tell myself: give yourself a break. This isn't forever. Just get to the end of the semester. Then reevaluate what this program is costing you emotionally and what you're getting out of it. You can do part time, take different classes, change majors or whatever feels better for you. Just remember that this happens to a lot of people. You're definitely not alone and it's not forever.",

I appreciate you all so much, it makes me feel much better that I\u2019m not alone in this. I posted this on another sub and people\u2019s responses were very dismissive - the general consensus was basically \u201c well if you feel that way you should drop out \u201c so it is much appreciated that you guys are giving me more proactive advice. After reading your comments, I\u2019ve decided to take a few steps. First, after I\u2019m done writing this I\u2019m going to attend a virtual appointment with a therapist from the health center and talk about how I\u2019ve been feeling. Second, I\u2019m set up with a student success coach so I\u2019m going to reach out to her ahead of our meeting tomorrow and let her know what I\u2019ve been dealing with so we can come up with an effective plan when we meet. Third, what\u2019s really stressing me out right now is a couple of essays - particularly a long history essay that I just don\u2019t know where to start with, so I\u2019ve booked an appointment at the writing center for tomorrow evening. Fourth, I\u2019m gonna reach out to my professors and let them know the struggles I\u2019m having. As for my friends issue, some of you have been kind enough to reach out to me and offer to hang out and meet up, so I\u2019m definitely going to pursue the offers that have been extended to me and try to make friends that way. Overall, I appreciate the support you guys have given me. It means a lot.",

My freshman year, I got a C my first semester, and this is coming from being an all A student in high school and taking the hardest classes. It took me a while to figure out how to properly study and take effective notes and other tips and tricks you learn over time. It gets better, I promise. I graduated last May with a 3.76 even though I thought my world was gonna end after that C from freshman year. In regards to friends, my best advice is anytime you meet someone who you like, get their number and text them and schedule a lunch or coffee date or monument walk/run or host a party/get together in your dorm. Take the initiative, don\u2019t wait for someone to ask you to go somewhere or invite you to a party, chances are that they\u2019re not doing anything else.",

My husband is a latecomer to college and did that, I saw firsthand how much determination that takes and now he is getting his degree from George Mason.\n\nThe colonial health center has amazing therapists, in my experience. I found my therapist through them and have been seeing her for 2 years now. Please take advantage of the free services that your tuition is providing you! Especially if you\u2019re experiencing suicidal ideation - you\u2019re reaching out here already, and I want to thank you for trusting us with that! But also reach out to people who can give you resources. I\u2019ve struggled with SI over the past couple months when I\u2019ve experienced dissertation difficulties, and I can tell you it gets better. \n\nIf you\u2019re worried you\u2019re struggling academically, I want to tell you that\u2019s okay. So often I have students who get frustrated they aren\u2019t getting a 4.0, but the reality is not everyone can get a 4.0 - learning is a *process* not a destinatioN! College is supposed to be hard, and the transition from CC to a larger university is never easy. In terms of work, prioritize your mental health and most importantly tell your profs/TAs you\u2019re struggling. Not all profs/TAs are empathetic but for me if a student tells me they\u2019re struggling I definitely take extra time/attention their way. If you were my student I\u2019d definitely be figuring out how we can work together to build your confidence. The best profs/TAs will do the same - find them and rely on them! It\u2019s our job.\n\nWith friend groups, college can be a hard time. I was a commuter at my college and it made it so hard to connect. I didn\u2019t really start making my core friend group until my senior year - and they are still my friends! Trust that sometimes you have to wait for the good ones to arrive. You seem very academically oriented - maybe consider starting study groups in the classes you\u2019re struggling with or just strike up convo with people after class! \n\nIt will get better, you\u2019re doing okay. &lt;3",

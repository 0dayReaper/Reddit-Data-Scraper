            "comment": "For Freshman you typically pick in July or early early August. That's what I did my freshmen year. There is no \"release\" of finalized schedule. When you register and whatever you register for is what you get. The first few weeks you can add and drop courses. Adding can be done if there's room. You can also fill out an RTF form only if the professor is ok with adding you. \n\nIt can be cut throat depending on your major especially IA or PC or with the UW you want. There are options in in BANDWEB to make mock schedules. When you register in the summer you can import a certain schedule and do it quicker than entering each course CRN or looking them up. \n\nRemember some courses may have a lab or discussion so no NOT forget to also register for those. \n\nHere is a link with some details on registering for courses for freshmen [https://studentlife.gwu.edu/incoming-first-year-online-class-registration](https://studentlife.gwu.edu/incoming-first-year-online-class-registration)\n\nRegistering for the fall semester as a freshman is different than future semesters. And will be different for your Spring 2024 semester. You will register during a week long period with all other students in undergraduate schools. ROTC and Sports have earlier options to register. The day you get to register is based on the amount of credits you have that are COMPLETED. If registration is in November and you brought no credits in than that means you register on the last day. Even if you are taking 18 credits in the fall semester. Course catalogs usually drop about 4-6 weeks before that registration week. \n\nAND from time to time certain courses offered will get dropped even after you registered or the night before you are set to register. A while back I had my desired schedule written out. The night before....... two courses were canceled. Than a week before the semester started one of my professors emailed to tell the class that the school messed up with the times and the class was at a different time than noted. I could not fit the new time into my schedule so that class was dropped too. All 3 courses were for my major too. So be prepared for really anything. It can go pretty smoothly but also be extremely chaotic.",

I\u2019m just trying to get a decent schedule hopefully that allows me to at least have one of the weekdays free of classes to do work and other stuff, I\u2019m not sure how bad the schedules are, but yeah",

                            "comment": "At GW you can bring in 24 credits from high school. I\u2019ve never done IB and idk anyone who has. But depending on the course you need a 6 or higher in the IB. A few languages allow a 5. \n\nNot bringing in credits when so many people seem to bring them in from AP, IB, etc. can make you feel like your behind. Undergrad for the most part is meant to be a standard 4 years. Some people do 5, some 3. So many things can interrupt your plans as well like illness, surgery, deaths in the family, finances, desired major change, etc. My freshmen year was fully remote because of Covid and than I had major spine surgery in the winter of my 2nd year. So tons of curve balls. GW can be a pain too will providing the classes you need. Sometimes they will fill up and sometimes they will get cancelled even after you register. Sometimes they won\u2019t offer it at all during an academic year. \n\nObviously certain programs can have options to accelerate or may require more credits. I ended up graduating a year early after bringing in about 12 credits and than doing about 15 over the summer and winter semesters. I honestly didn\u2019t have it in me to do another full year of undergrad and it saved money. \n\nBut I don\u2019t view coming in with zero credits as disadvantageous. This sounds corny but you really just have to make the most of it. Depending your major and stuff you can do internships for credit too which adds to your resume and provides you will skills, connections, and experience. It also allows you to do internships as a class rather than doing classes and an internship on top of it. Little less stress and sorta like killing 2 birds with 1 stone. This depends on your major ofc. I know CCASS allows it for nearly all majors. The Business schools allows it but there\u2019s like certain stipulations and such. \n\nI\u2019d also say, just because you can finish a program quicker, does not always mean you\u2019ll succeed or do better than someone who took an extra year to do it. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll get fucked over in later semesters either. It always could if you want to finish something sooner. But for the most part programs expect people to be working with no credit coming in because that\u2019s going to be the majority of students. You might not get to do stuff at the same semester as other kids or peers who came in with credits, but that does not mean your behind. You are where your expected to be. They just are ahead. \n\nI graduated this month and I only started my first internship related program in January. So in my \u201csenior year\u201d but only my 3rd year at college. I know other people who have done a program in 4 years and have had a major related internship each year. I finished a year before them but they also have more experience in terms of hands on stuff.\n\nIn terms of trying to get more credits at GW\u2026\n\n- At GW there are LSPA courses. They are 1 credit each. Not all colleges allow them to count toward your needed credits. I was in CCAS and did 2 credits of the max 3. I think Milken does not allow then. \n- You can also petition a professor to add a credit hour to a course you are in. If it works they will assign you more work. \n- You can take summer courses at GW. But if you want something cheaper you can take courses at other schools. I did them in the summer and winter. You can transfer up to 12 credits but I can only be 3 classes. I did 10 credits. 2 courses were 3 and 1 was 4. I\u2019ve done them at UMASS and MSU(NJ). They were online.  \n- The max amount of credits you can take a semester is 18. You can take 19 I believe but you must pay extra\n- Lower level French and I think German + Italian courses are 4 credits. There are also like 2 intensive Spanish courses that are 6 credits. Sometimes an 8 credit Italian course will be offered and than it gets cancelled",

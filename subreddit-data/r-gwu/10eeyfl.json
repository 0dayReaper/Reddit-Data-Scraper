    "postText": "I joined SOC 1001 this term because I thought both this class and SOC 1002 fulfilled the Gpac for local/civic engagement and also for emphasis on my major requirements. When I checked it again today, I realized that SOC 1001 doesn\u2019t contain the GPAC attribute. Not sure if I should drop this class now and join another that fulfills a gpac because most of the classes this term seem to begin at awkward times for me to register in my schedule.",

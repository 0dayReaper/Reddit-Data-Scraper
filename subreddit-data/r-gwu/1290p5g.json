Like, why would someone choose the meal plan with the least amount of money? What are the downsides? I often hear that GW students starve because of expensive food. What does that actually mean in context of the meal plans?",

Those students struggled with the old meal plan (no dining halls, just money on gworld for restaurants and grocery stores)\n\nGW realized that they could address that issue and make more money by opening their own dining halls, which they\u2019ve now actually competed. \n\nNow, for the low low price of $2,800, you can eat at what is basically just an unlimited Applebees buffet",

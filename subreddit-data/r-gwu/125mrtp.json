First year outta college and she's already been traveling across the country following different elections, controversies, and local legislation when she's not on the hill at press conferences asking politicians questions and directing news segments. She's watching and making history every day and is a fresh grad, if that helps answer your question at all:)",

If you are sure want to do journalism professionally, it\u2019s a great investment in your future career. That being said, it can also be a bit limiting if you want to do something else outside of journalism. But living in DC and going to GW is a great way to land internships. \n\n(All of this is assuming you can comfortably meet the high price tag)",

In order to get a good journalism job, you need money and connection. I dropped it and then I chose engineering. I recommend you pick something else",

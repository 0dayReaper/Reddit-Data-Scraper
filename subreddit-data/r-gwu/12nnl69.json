I took an intro class for $300 online instead of the 6k GW quoted me (you can transfer 9 credits over to GW after you enroll) \n\nAnd then for some reason I got an email from GW saying that I was eligible to take a free summer class this summer. After I graduate. Thanks for that",

Like what was said previously highly recommend taking a Community college class if you\u2019re looking to cover a more general req since a lot of them are also fully online depending on the school",

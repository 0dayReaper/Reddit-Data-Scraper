    "postText": "I am looking for summer intern housing in DC (6/10-8/12). I will be using public transportation and interning at PwC.  I have tried all of the FB pages and have been overwhelmed by scammers. It is crazy the amount of effort they put into it. I have also reached out to local colleges for summer housing options. Can anyone recommend any other reliable resources? What areas should I avoid for safety?  Thank you.",

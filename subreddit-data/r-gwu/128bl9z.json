    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m an admitted student and was gonna visit before deciding to accept my decision. Was wondering, what do you guys think I should see both on campus and outside around the city to help me make up my mind? I\u2019m studying at the Columbian College of Arts and Science, environmental studies with a pre law focus. Thanks",

Go see the national cathedral. Go to the museums. These are things I regularly do as a student. Imagine what it would be like to actually live here. The connections you\u2019ll make being a mile away from the white house, etc\u2026",

The tour guide only showed us Foggy Bottom. However, after the tour drive through other GW and DC facilities. Like, I really wanted to see Mount Vernon, so that\u2019s what my mom and I did. We also drove through the neighborhood around the Vern. Before the tour, we went and drove through some Embassy areas and saw the Cathedral.\n\nI suggest you go with the tour and the on your own time, go to other places in Ward 2",

The area around it is secluded by trees (including bamboo) and the neighborhood is pretty suburban. \n\nThe buildings have an older style (red bricks with white columns) but look decent and well managed. The soccer field (at least I think it was soccer) looked so green and well kept. The only annoying thing was the confusing and bumpy roads through the campus",

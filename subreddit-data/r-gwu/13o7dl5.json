Especially when it comes to any type of etiquette that may be expected of you but not explicitly told- I don\u2019t wanna walk in completely blind and any tips or advice would be much appreciated! Thank you all!",

With that said, don\u2019t get too comfortable, it\u2019s still a serious work environment.\n\nThings to avoid: \n\nDon\u2019t show up hungover \n\nDefinitely don\u2019t show up still drunk from the night before \n\nDon\u2019t talk with other interns about how wild your party at XYZ was last night and how you\u2019ve gotten up to ABC since getting to DC.\n\nGeneral tips to make the most out of your experience: \n\nGet to know everyone in your office. Try getting coffee with everyone at least once. \n\nObviously hang out with your offices interns, but try to get to know other interns. Join groupmes, go out with people, drop by offices and just get to know other people. Fundamentally, a summer on the hill is pretty much just a networking opportunity, so make the most out of it",

But then you look at schools like Northeastern who are receiving over 3x the amount of applications, so their acceptance rate is 3x lower. If anything this speaks more to GW needing to do some more marketing and finding things to draw students. I think GW needs to stop relying on its location and actually incorporate things students are looking for like co-op programs",

Good opportunities, good location, good facilities, now it\u2019s just time to raise the academic standard of admissions, in part by using a plan similar to LeBlanc\u2019s idea.\n\nFor gods sake, Purdue and UIUC are in the middle of nowhere and are some of the top engineering programs in the country. A school right in the middle of DC with a booming tech market literally a single metro stop away is as well positioned as any to do well in STEM.",

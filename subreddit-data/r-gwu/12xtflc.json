Waller\u2019s class is really engaging, the course work is easy, and if you like philosophy the class is fun. There are a lot of readings, but you really just have to do the readings that correlate to your essay\u2019s topic/philosopher.  \nAs long as you put effort and do some extra credit you should get an A.",

Get your oral communications requirement out of the way\n\nTake Cline for Intro to Archaeology, incredibly accomplished man and an easy class if you know basic ancient history (ex: \u201cWhat are canopic jars?\u201d, \u201cWhere is Machu Picchu located?\u201d, etc)",

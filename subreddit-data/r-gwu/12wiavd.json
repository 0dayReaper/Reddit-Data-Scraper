They also just limit the applicant pool so much so that if you don\u2019t apply within a few days of internships getting posted, it\u2019ll probably be too late to even apply \n\n&gt; Capitol Hill \n\nIncredibly easy. I interned in the house and senate my freshman year, which isn\u2019t uncommon. Just join one of the political orgs on campus, reach out to alumni/current students in an office you\u2019re interested in, and it\u2019s pretty much that easy\n\n&gt; how much time/other tips \n\nMy freshman year I struggled to juggle 20 hours. Last year I was fine with 40. It just depends on you, your courseload, and how mentally taxing your internship is\n\nI also don\u2019t recommend trying to intern your freshman fall. There\u2019s always going to be that one kid in intro to IA flexing their hilternship in September, but I\u2019d focus on getting adjusted to college, making friends, and nailing your GPA\n\nBut overall in DC throughout the fall/spring semesters, there are more internships available than there are students available to fill them. It\u2019s not uncommon for hill offices and think tanks to hire students on the spot/after a short interview if they need someone for the semester (how I got a hilternship and a job at a big thinktank)",

I would assume that milken, CCAS and SMPA are the same, I just have no idea\n\nWith that said, I've never found gw's career advising services to be particularly helpful. I've had much better success reaching out directly to people in the professional world with jobs I'd want to do and setting up informational interviews to ask about their careers/paths and to pick their brains",

            "comment": "Maybe look into the GW alumni network, they can be helpful. Also, I would highly recommend actively forming a bond with professors in the field you are interested in or anything related. This sounds simple or kind of \u201cduh\u201d, but I promise you it works. Email them, stay after class for a few minutes and ask questions, ask to get coffee. I can\u2019t overstate how much just actively being engaged with certain professors set me up for my career. Most of my higher level (3rd/4th year) GW professors were so, so helpful in getting me internships, connected with people in the field, and coaching me, simply because I took 5 minutes after to ask them about their work in the field and then express a common interest. Even if they don\u2019t directly know someone, they will know someone who knows someone and will most likely offer to link you up with them (this was the case for me). They were very helpful with me, more than any service. A lot of the professors are very passionate about what they do and want to actively help younger generations who share that interest. A good tip for people in general also is the more specific question you can ask about their work or something they did, the better. Not just generic questions, be direct, informed ones about a specific thing. The majority of career opportunities will usually come to you from informal connections you make as opposed to simply generic career counseling services.",

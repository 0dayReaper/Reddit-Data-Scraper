    "postText": "Hi so I\u2019m a neuroscience major in my freshman year trying to get my pre reqs out. I\u2019m applying to transfer to UVA and W&amp;M. I got a 4.0 this semester, ended high school with a 4.4, got really good recs, and I\u2019m halfway decent at essays, so I\u2019ll hopefully be somewhere else next year. I have the option to take physics 1 this semester but only with this professor. Every single review on rate my is scarily horrible, but I want to know if people are exaggerating at all. I had another professor notorious for his difficultly on rate my and I got a 99 and a rec from him (to their credit his class average is very low). Will this tank my GPA or should I just do it with Jha to get the credit out of the way? I\u2019m shooting for an A and honestly havent done physics since online school junior year.",

            "comment": "I heard mixed reviews about him. Some of my friends really like him while others really hate him. If you are super set on transferring out, I'd recommend taking another pre req class and waiting to take physic later just to save your GPA. Since you're a freshman, you have plenty of time to finish your pre reqs.",

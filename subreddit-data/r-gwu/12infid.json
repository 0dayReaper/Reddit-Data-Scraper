The shared bathrooms aren\u2019t a huge deal and even tho it\u2019s a single it\u2019s actually a REALLY social dorm. We always had our doors open and would hang out with everyone who lived on the floor\n\nEdit: that being said none of the freshman doors had been renovated at that point, so they all sucked lol",

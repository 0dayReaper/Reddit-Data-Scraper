    "postText": "Yes, I\u2019m a Freshman. Yes, I am lost. The location of this class, confirmed by the instructor, reads Duques Hall #361. I know that I\u2019m in the right building, especially because I have a different class here. However, I take the elevator to third floor and a plaque indicates that the rooms do not surpass #358\u2026 I\u2019ve tried walking around on this floor and others and there is no #361 that I can find. Any pointers?",

I don\u2019t know which room is 361 exactly but it might be the glass walled room next to the study lounge in the corner. There are also some rooms in the area connecting Funger to Duques so it might be those, which if you are facing the entrance to the bathrooms you take a left.",

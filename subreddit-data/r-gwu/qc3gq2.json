That\u2019s a lot more than can be said about most profs in the econ department. His best quality was that the lectures were entirely self-contained - you don\u2019t need to know anything except for what he goes through in class. He can seem a bit like an ass, especially during lectures, but is insanely kind and helpful if you approach him one on one. \n\n\n\nMy comments about Joshi were undisputed but I\u2019ll take a moment to gush. That man is a gem, a genius through and through. He showed up to class with a stack of dry erase markers and lectured entirely from memory. You could ask a question about any example and without skipping a beat he\u2019d know exactly what you were asking and why and give you two more examples to make sure you understood.\n\nAll in all micro &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; macro offered at GW",

    "postText": "\\*Rant incoming\\* Looking through all the \"how do I make friends here\" threads in the archive or that pop up, everyone in the comments all say the same thing, join orgs and clubs, join orgs and clubs. The clubs here NEVER MEET, seriously if you've kept your eyes on GW engage this entire semester or go on there now it's all one off stuff like hearing a speaker or tote bag decorating. The one time a club does meet if you're lucky, the people there are already friends with each other and just talk with each other and ignore new people. Like I came here to talk politics with people, because that's what GW is known for, and the college republicans and democrats had 1 meeting each this entire semester.",

Idk if you're a freshman or not but regardless the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry. But there's no reason to despair we figure things out!\n\nI've personally found a lot of luck with different orgs. If you're only looking for politically motivated orgs/friends I can't help you much but for something like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu they meet multiple times a week + socials! Comment if you want to talk more I'm happy to chat!",

It's cheesy, but I really recommend strolling through org fairs when they're hosted. There are so many neat and super specific orgs at GW that even if one you're looking for isn't there, talking to the people at the fairs and tabling in Kogan and USC might lead you down the right path to finding your place. And you can usually grab some stickers, swag, and whatnot at org fairs too.",

GW used to have a Huge student org culture, so I don\u2019t blame you for feeling like you were lied to. \n\nThe easiest way to make friends for me was getting a campus job. If you\u2019re not someone who easily makes friends, going to GW can be challenging and almost shocking. It\u2019s not uncommon for people at GW to latch onto a friend group their first few weeks and never expand, which can be super isolating if you have a trouble finding your niche the first semester. \n\nDo your best to stay involved, even if it\u2019s not at clubs. Go to speaker events, things hosted by CLRE, etc. \n\nIf you\u2019re into politics/geopolitics/simulations, I would recommend [GW\u2019s Strategic Crisis Simulations](https://www.gwuscs.org/upcoming-simulations). They have an open registration for their next event. They don\u2019t meet too often but I\u2019ve heard great things/that people make a lot of connections through that.",

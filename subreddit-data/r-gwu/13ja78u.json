But that was only because my parents were willing to put it under their name while i repay. Other than that I would look into private companies like Sallie Mae or College Ave.",

Even if you find some good lenders while in school, you'll probably want to consolidate later, so keep in mind that you're only looking for a \\~4 year relationship out of this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoFi was new at the time, and their shtick was that they had alumni-funded loans for each university that they supported, and if anything bad happened they would also use that network for job placement assistance, etc. and basically put you in touch with the folks who had funded your specific loan if weird circumstances arose. They claimed all that resulted in much higher repayment rates than regular bank loans, which let them offer higher returns to the investors even with lower rates for students.",

I\u2019m a upcoming fall 2023 graduate student looking for housing. \nPlease let me know if you have any suggestions, referrals or leads for a studio or 1 bedroom apt. Looking for a place in a safe neighbourhood and around 20 mins travel time to the uni. \nThank you.",

            "comment": "Zillow and Apartments.com are good resources for finding places that are leasing. A lot of grad students live in Arlington (Crystal City, Pentagon City, Clarendon, etc) near metro stops, which puts travel time to Foggy between 15-30 mins depending how far out on the metro lines you choose to go. There's a good number of one bedroom and studios there at better prices than on Foggy but they're still pretty expensive. If you decide you need/want a roommate, GWs off campus housing site is pretty good for that.\n\nHope this helps!",

            "comment": "First of all, depending on where you\u2019re moving from, be prepared for high rent costs. DC is one of the most expensive places for housing in the US. My friends back where I\u2019m from pay significantly less than I do for more. I definitely recommend looking in Arlington-I live in Pentagon City and so do several of my friends. I pay the least of all my friends who live on their own-I pay $1610 for a 1bed without utilities. I have a friend who lives downtown who pays over $2K. Make a list of the top three things you need and then narrow it down from there about what\u2019s best for you. Like I sacrificed being closer to the school to save money, but it\u2019s super easy to get there by metro from where I live so it\u2019s not a problem. Some people sacrifice space and live in studios or with roommates to be closer.",

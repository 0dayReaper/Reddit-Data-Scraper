I\u2019ve tried VeryApt but I\u2019ve never heard back. How shady is Facebook Marketplace or Facebook groups? \n\nP.S. I\u2019m looking for something in Foggy Bottom only. Max budget of 2k - so either a 1BR or a 2BR (in case of 2BR, would need to get a roommate as well, so would appreciate suggestions on how to find a roommate as well)",

Zillow and Apartments.com are good bets for finding buildings and then applying through the specific rental agency.\n\nWith a 2k budget on foggy, I think you're looking at getting lucky with a cheap studio or needing a roommate - I recommend the off campus housing site. It's roommate finding site is pretty good",

            "comment": "Yeah 2k will not get you a one bedroom in foggy generally, it might get you a small dark studio but you'll be hard-pressed to find something with a bedroom door for under 2k in the foggy area. The Statesmen on F street is pretty common grad student housing and their studios start at $2080 and one bedrooms at $2,400 and that's pretty inexpensive for the area. The fancier places like Varsity are easily more with less square footage. You'll either need to become okay with living in a studio, up your budget, become okay with living outside foggy, or really buckle down and find a roommate ASAP before summer. Trulia and [apartments.com](https://apartments.com) might help. Facebook Marketplace and facebook groups (and Craigslist) will have the hidden gems and great deals, but they are also flooded with scams so you have to be super duper diligent to check your sources and do your research before sending any type of application fee or anything. Good luck! The DC housing market is brutal and it is particularly awful in the foggy bubble, but with some time and digging I'm sure you'll be able to find something appropriate!",

I really enjoyed this course for my art requirement and the majority of the class was just readings and listening to music. Mostly electronic music but there was brief learning about past forms of technology used for music up until the present day. There were only 2 short exams when I took this course, no quizzes, and a final project. I remember the participation grade was a high percentage, but it was a very engaging class and easy. I took this course with Professor Heather Stebbins who really cares for students and overall made the course a lot of fun. I would definitely recommend it.",

However, she is militant about paying attention when she is lecturing and will straight up throw your ass out if youre on your cell phone while shes talking, which I didnt really care about.",

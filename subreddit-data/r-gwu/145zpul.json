    "postText": "I was accepted for the fall of 2023 in GW, however I have to respond before June 15 and I have not yet received my financial aid package so I do not know if they are going to give me any scholarship or grant. The registration fee is 800 dollars, is it worth paying it without knowing when they are going to give me and then lose those 800 if they don't give me anything? On the other hand, I have a 98% scholarship offer at the Catholic university of America , should I accept it? Or wait for GW? I want to go to medical school so I'm afraid of losing possible opportunities that maybe GW have and catholic doesn't.",

            "comment": "Generally speaking, If you\u2019re planning on med school, go wherever is cheapest for your undergrad. Catholic is a good school and I wouldn\u2019t think going to GW would provide you with any significant benefit for getting into med school. As long as you have a high gpa and high mcat score, where you get your undergrad isn\u2019t a huge factor. Also going to undergrad for basically free will help you so much in the long run, as med school debt is no joke. \n\nBut It\u2019s honestly unfair for GW to make you decide before even knowing how much it\u2019ll cost! I\u2019d try to get on the FinAid office\u2019s ass about that.",

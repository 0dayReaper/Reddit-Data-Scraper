    "postText": "Unfortunately, I and others in her UW1020 class today received an email informing us that she had passed away yesterday, February 9th. Regardless of what you thought of her teaching or her class, please keep her in mind and if you are able to do so, I'm sure her family would appreciate any kind notes from previous students. Stay safe folks and take care of each other.",

She was a wonderful professor and one of the few who I would regularly go to office hours just to talk about the course and her work. One of the few professors at GW who I still think about pretty often.\n\nI just remember her being incredibly patient, insightful, and kind - I guess you have to be when you're founding a field of study that involves you dealing with Trekkies like me all the time. May she rest in peace &lt;3\n\nEdit: you mentioned sending notes to folks who know her - anyone have a link to an obituary page I could post a message on? Shit stings and I would love to just shout into the void that she'll be missed.",

But she was wonderful, very kind and really welcoming of the different 'fandoms' we participated in. I felt like she sincerely helped students love writing.\n\nWould also appreciate a link to the obituary page or any way we can contact her.",

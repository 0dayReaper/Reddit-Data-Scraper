            "comment": "HVAC systems in large buildings often cannot easily switch between AC and heat like the HVAC in your house. So they\u2019ll be set to heat mode when the weather first gets cold (late October/early November around here) and then set to AC mode in the spring when it starts to warm up. If we have an unusually warm day like today, the AC won\u2019t be turned on and it\u2019ll get a bit warm. Same thing with many dorms, apartments, and other campus buildings. \n\nOr the brand new HVAC system is already fucked, that\u2019d also be funny",

I am international student so I have no clue about clubs. Where I studied student clubs are non existent. Thank you in advance",

            "comment": "From what I've seen, for more recreational clubs, such as our esports/gaming club that you described, grad students can join just like normal students and take part in events and such. I'm not a grad student so I don't know about graduate-specific groups, but I would imagine some such clubs exist.\n\n\nWe have a website that lists all of our clubs. You can go to gwu.campuslabs.com or probably just google 'gw engage'. Hopefully you'll find something there that you're interested in. I've had very positive experiences with many clubs and met a lot of people, including graduate students, through them.",

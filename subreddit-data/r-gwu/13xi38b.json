I\u2019m asking because I\u2019m trying to get a job my junior and senior year, but it\u2019s all contingent on like availability.",

As in you get better scheduling? \n\nAll three will likely depend on you and the classes you need to take, but in my case the answer to all three was yes. I worked 40+ hour/week at a bar nearby my Junior and senior years and it was very manageable",

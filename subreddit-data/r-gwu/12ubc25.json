    "postText": "Hello, it took me over a month through dss to get approved for my accommodations (single w/bath and ESA). Housing came out and they placed me in a room that doesn\u2019t meet my accommodations in the slightest (granted I signed up for the room under the understanding I would be switched out of it). I emailed them and I have been placed on the waitlist for a room and that I\u2019ll be contacted if I get off of it. Has anyone else had this experience? We\u2019re you able to eventually get off of it? How long did it take? If you didn\u2019t get off what solutions were provided? \nSorry for the amount of questions. Getting housing that accommodates me has been stressing me out for months so it\u2019s disappointing I that I don\u2019t have anything to show for it.",

I\u2019m exceedingly dissapointed and don\u2019t really know what to do because it will be very hard for me to get by without it. Im just going to keep emailing Dan the head of housing for updates and getting everything in written confirmation",

It so crazy that they aren\u2019t really (at least currently) accommodating all of the DSS requests. I remember in my meeting with my DSS person she was like \u201cwell they can\u2019t empty out a triple\u201d-which they totally could they just don\u2019t want to loose money",

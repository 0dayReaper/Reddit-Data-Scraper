The biggest thing i would say if you\u2019re going to do that though is to be 100% sure those credits are going to transfer because I got an A in a math course at community college and it doesn\u2019t transfer, which sucks.",

I will say with my Gap semester I worked a TON and did community college classes to save money at GW (best decision ever). \n\nI will say it gets really lonely as a spring admit during that semester because everyone around you is having a normal, fun college experience and GW sucks at helping you out with getting ready. Like no info, we caught them lying to us a few times, and 0 communication or advising whatsoever. So if you do choose to enroll for spring 2024, also use that extra semester to learn as much as you can about GW and how it works, especially your potential major requirements.\n\nJust be productive! whatever that means to you- read, find routines, teach yourself how to cook, align with who you want to be in college :)",

GW is very lenient with transferring classes, typically as long as the name of the course is the same it is automatically accepted. It\u2019s also a good time to get a lot of gen Ed\u2019s out of the way.",

    "postText": "I'm curious if anyone here is in the Online program for Doctor of Engineering in Cybersecurity Analytics. I have a background in Computer Science and Data Science, but NO cyber experience.  Would like to learn cyber in a formal program and then apply that to a Praxis involving my background in machine learning and data science.\n\n* Would I be lost having no cyber background?\n* Are the courses hands on learning or is it just writing papers about the topics\n* Are there a lot of technical programming/math assignments/exams etc\n* Is there any group work or is it all individual\n* Is every class synchronous or are some recorded for future viewing (concerned about family conflicts that arise on Saturday)\n\n Any insight would be appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

It would be nice to have confirmation from someone in the program. It's a big commitment (both time and money).

I spoke with several people doing it through Northcentral University (NCU) and it sounds like a very different experience than one would have in-person.

Usually, doctoral degrees are to expand on existing knowledge that you already have and are generally preparing you to teach. Though, this degree is more geared towards professional engineers in the field to be able to better apply research methodologies in practical settings. Though some of the best professors in the program are D.Engs and not PhD, but that is for another discussion. \n* Since you already have a CS background, you should be fine. The program actually has a lot of CS degree holders with no cybersecurity experience\n* Since you already have a Data Science background this will be just leaning to apply DS to a new topic, so again, I think you will be fine\n\nAre the courses hands on learning or is it just writing papers about the topics\n\n* Depends on the class, but a lot of the courses are hands-on with some type of tool, e.g. Python, Splunk, forensics tools, etc.\n\nAre there a lot of technical programming/math assignments/exams etc\r  \n\r\n\n* You need college calculus to get into the program. If you do not have that you can take a calculus class before the start of the program\n* Since the classes involve cryptography there is some math, though not in every class, and it is not that difficult\n* You do need to know some Python and Regex, but not much more than that, and you can pick that up in the program\n\nIs there any group work or is it all individual\n\n* Some group discussion, but very minimal\n* All projects are individual\n\nIs every class synchronous or are some recorded for future viewing (concerned about family conflicts that arise on Saturday)\n\n* Class participation is mandatory, with few exceptions. Classes are Sat's from 9-4 with a 1 hour break for lunch",

Regarding your question about my desire to get a doctoral degree in a field in which I have \"no familiarity\"... perhaps I was too vague with my words.  I have a strong CS background with an emphasis on AI/ML security.  I also have strong data science and analytical skills. Despite the fact that my training in \"traditional\" cybersecurity is limited, the program appeals to me as I feel the foundations would be similar to my technical background.  I also feel the future of cyber threats involve AI/ML topics with which I am very familiar. \n\nI am happy to hear that mathematics, python programming and cyber tools will be used    - I am specifically interested in hands on learning and research as opposed to some online degree programs that simply require essays and papers to be written for weekly assignments.\n\nI am still a little concerned about every Saturday being mandatory. I would fully intend to attend the full days, however there will be occasional family/work conflicts.  I would like to know that occasional asynchronous attendance is permitted. (not just for \"emergencies\", rather typical personal conflicts that arise.)\n\nThanks again for your input!",

It is a time commitment, that is for sure. and it does suck having to go to class for 8-9 hours on Saturdays. But keep in mind that this program is accelerated. At other universities, you would likely spend 3 -4 years doing the same thing. The GWU program is designed to get you in and get you out. This is also not to say the program is inferior to other programs, the classes require a lot of work outside the full-day commitment on Saturday. As there are usually 2 - 3 chapters worth of material to read for both classes and homework that are due for the upcoming week. It can be a bit cumbersome, but it is highly worth it in the end.",

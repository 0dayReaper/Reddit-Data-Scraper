Once you found it, there will be a call number (Dewey decimal number) which will let you know where it is located. Usually it tells you if its in the stacks or in the reserved areas. If you have trouble finding it you can have a librarian assist you. Depending on whether you can check it out, you might be able to take it back to your dorm or you may need to copy the pages that you'll need for class using their book scanner. The librarians are usually pretty nice and helpful when it comes to finding the book you need.",

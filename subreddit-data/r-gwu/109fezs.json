    "postText": "Hey all, \n\nI'm enrolled in GTCH 2003 (Steps 1+2) this upcoming semester. I saw that there is a requirement to teach at a middle school sometime this semester. The problem is- I'm a low income student and I need to work this semester and I can't really have this on top of my work if it is too intensive. I'm really only taking this class to fulfill the GPAC requirement. With that said, how extensive is the teaching at a middle school component is of the course and how labor intensive is this course?",

            "comment": "Hey! I took GTCH 2003 last spring, it\u2019s not as extensive, you only go to the school 6 times throughout the semester (3 observations, and 3 teaching) you also tell them your availability at the beginning of the semester and you get paired with your availability. The class is an easy A, and just has you working with your teaching partner to make lesson plans and getting ready for your upcoming teaching",

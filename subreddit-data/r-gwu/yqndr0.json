Even if it wasn\u2019t malicious or intentional, they are inherently disenfranchising voters who may have needed to vote during that frame and did not have any other time they could vote that day. \n\nTraining where I am from always takes place a week before the election, and it\u2019s honestly a super easy job. There is no reason for them to open late unless there was a public safety issue. This is not GW\u2019s fault though, just sucks it happened on their property they opened up for public use.",

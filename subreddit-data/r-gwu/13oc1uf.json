            "comment": "July or even as late as August. The fiscal year closes in July. The summer is when every department submits their requests for wage budgets to the central finance office, requesting lines to hire students for the upcoming FY.\n\nWork study only covers up to 70 percent of student wages, so departments have to ask for enough funding to cover the extra 30 percent in wages. Each position must be approved before a department can begin advertising the roles online. These talks can take a while, so even if you don't see job listings appearing, it's best just to check once a week. \n\nI don't know if it's the same for student positions, but the Staff/Faculty job listings get updated every Friday.",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm a prospective student who really enjoys singing/acting/performing arts in general and was wondering if anyone involved in/knows about a capella, choir, or any type of performing arts group at GW could tell me about their experience. How competitive is it to get into these groups? How significant of a time commitment are they? Has being a part of these groups helped you find a welcoming and inclusive community? I'm not planning to major in anything performing arts-related, but I really enjoyed doing them in high school and am looking to join a similar community in college. Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "We have an absolute ton of performing arts groups. The a capella crew is absolutely a world to get invested in, there are about 6 groups who compete against each other pitch perfect style once a year and have concerts regularly, my favorite are the sons of pitch personally which is an all male crooners type deal. \nRegarding competitiveness they have standards but you\u2019re bound to get into at least one or more if you audition to a good amount\nWhen it comes to choir, you can go into the choir done by the music department, in fact you get credit for being in it. I haven\u2019t heard great things personally but if you treat it like a really easy class since you\u2019re gaining actual credit from it you\u2019ll be fine",

The theatre and music departments also try to do a musical every spring.\n\nPast that, there are also a fair number of dance groups, a gospel choir student org, and plenty of other groups I'm definitely just forgetting. GW has a surprisingly vibrant performing arts community, you'd be bound to find something you liked to do.",

For music department ensembles, they meet once a week as a class section. For department theatre, rehearsals are usually between 3-5 days per week.\n\nStudent organizations also have boards, so if you feel super passionately about the things you do, you can join the board and get even more involved.\n\nI can say, as someone who is coming up on graduating this year, I managed to do a ton of theatre and performance things over the last four years. I did department theatre, joined a student theatre board, and got to do work with my friends on their thesis projects in theatre and music. All of that, and I had plenty of time to do my classwork, eat, get good sleep, and all that fun stuff.",

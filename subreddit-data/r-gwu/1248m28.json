Anyone have any experience in their programs?\n\n2) How hard is it to secure a single dorm as a freshman?\n\n3) How\u2019s the party life there? And how\u2019s the work/free time balance?\n\nI got into Pittsburgh and GWU. GWU I got a 30k scholarship for but Pittsburgh is still cheaper. Now I have to decide.",

I don't remember if there are actual singles on the Vern on just suite style apartments with big living rooms. Mitchell might also be turning into upperclassman housing, so fact check that?\n\n3. I've loved my time at GW but you're not going to have the traditional 'tailgate and basketball game' experience you'll get at a bigger school. I personally really enjoy the social scene being super integrated into the city, social life is largely centered around off campus parties hosted by club sports, professional fraternities, student orgs, and (less so) social fraternities.\n\nas for work/life balance, not sure about SEAS but I'm in elliott and I've never had trouble managing school and either interning or working every semester. \r  \n\n\na few links i'd recommend checking out:\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/gwu/comments/11ychl3/what\\_is\\_the\\_party\\_scene\\_in\\_gwu/\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ma3qgu/deleted\\_by\\_user/\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/qpggoz/deleted\\_by\\_user/\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/11ji4vq/comment/jb5gbjj/?context=999",

It\u2019s pretty isolated. Im afraid that it will become high school 2.0 where I get stuck with a reputation that spreads around my grade level since grades are less than 1000 each. I really want to meet new people and explore myself without worrying about judgements.\n\nSince GWU is 10k students, do you think that this wont be an issue?",

Hopefully he can help me or GWU is probably not an option sadly (as Haverford would be more accommodating). \n\nAnd I worded it nicely on the post, but hearing misophonia triggers feels worse than nails on a chalkboard. And when the trigger is sharp breathing and sniffling, it\u2019s constant. I can\u2019t go anywhere without earbuds. The sounds make me scratch at my arms because the pain diverts my attention, and I\u2019ve been accused of self harm because of it as it can get really bad. Taking vacations is not fun as my brother snores, earplugs are not enough, and earbuds are uncomfortable since I sleep on my side. If I had to hear it at night every night for a year, I would probably go insane.\n\nHearing is also my best sense, so it gets really bad in a classroom with 30 other kids when I can\u2019t wear earbuds. My school made accommodations for this reason so that I can wear earbuds at all times. Sucks when it\u2019s hard to hear lessons but it\u2019s better than the alternative.\n\nA roommate is definitely not an option. I have to always fall asleep before them or use my earbuds every night (which if they aren\u2019t charged, or they break on me, just makes complications). \n\n(As someone who notices this stuff a lot, fun fact: guys are way louder with breathing and yawning sounds, but sniffling is the same between guys and girls. Always outliers though, definitely girls that make just as much noise. Just what I picked up on lol)",

It\u2019s rare to have a class smaller than 30 people here. And I know what misophonia is but because it isn\u2019t professionally diagnosable it probably wouldn\u2019t work for getting an accommodation specifically from a medical provider, but the autism accommodation could maybe note it? Just noting that misophonia alone wouldn\u2019t really cut it from what I can tell.",

If the professor gets quiet, then I\u2019m kinda screwed..\n\nAlso, the autism diagnosis can give me leverage I\u2019d reckon cause of sensory issues.",

            "comment": "First of all, congratulations on your acceptances into both GW and Pitt. To get into schools like those requires significant work and dedication and you will do well with either choice you make.\n\nI go to GW and what I\u2019ll say is it\u2019s an acquired taste. There are some great opportunities, being in D.C. means you have loads of access to internships and other things happening in the city. The academics here are also as good as anywhere else. \n\nThat being said, GW students are very individualistic and I find it a bit lonely on campus at times. It is a bit cold and brutalist and I find people like to stick to their small group of friends. \n\nAs for your major, GW has a fairly newly developed STEM program that will place you well. I do think though that PITT has better STEM programs than we do. \n\nMy overall take: If you really like DC and you\u2019d like to score some internships down the road, GW will place you well. But beware that GW appeals to a specific kind of student, and if you\u2019re not that then it can be a tricky place to spend your four years at.",

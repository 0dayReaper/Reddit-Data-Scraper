    "postText": "Hi, I am interning in D.C. from early June to late August and am looking for an apartment to stay in for that time period.\n\nI wanted to ask here as well as looking in D.C. because the GW area is in a decent location for my job, and I assume many students will be away for the Summer. More relevant info about myself: I am a 25 year old Masters Student. I am fairly clean and quiet, and have no pets. I plan on using the Metro service to commute to Navy Yard in the morning.\n\nPlease DM me if you are interested!",

You\u2019re going to be paying a premium to live near GW, which will be of absolutely no value to you. \n\nYou\u2019ll probably have a much better time either living right in navy yard somewhere else on the green line like U st or Shaw. You\u2019ll probably get a cheaper place, almost certainly get a nicer place, and be somewhere with better nightlife",

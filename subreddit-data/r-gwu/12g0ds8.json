    "postText": "How is the computer science program. How difficult is it? I enjoy CS and programming, but I struggle when it comes to calculus and statistics. I'm sure I could get tutoring, but how intense/rigorous is it to graduate with a major in it. I'm looking at a B.A. right now.\n\nTo add on, I'd like to do a B.A. in CS and then a double major in Psych.",

            "comment": "I did the B.S., here\u2019s what I think. The classes are difficult, but I guess that would happen at any school you go to for CS. Many of the electives require a lot of outside learning on your own time. HW, labs, and projects took up practically all my time. Since you want to do the BA, you can skip out on some of the harder classes. I didn\u2019t think there were enough resources, especially during covid when we were online.  This includes getting extra help, advising\u2026 I got a good job after graduating but not because I was advised well, but because I studied a lot. The pros are that the classes are small and there\u2019s a lot of peer work.  I liked the people in my classes and we would study together a lot.  Some of the professors I had were awesome, others not so much.",

The biggest thing is to declare early (I think you might need 4-6 semesters to finish) since some there are some prereqs to finish up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're looking to double major, I think the B.A. option is designed for second majors but there might be some complications if your primary degree is a BA or BS and if SEAS and ESIA have different general school requirements.\n\nAsk me if you have any questions or reach out to the seas advising office!",

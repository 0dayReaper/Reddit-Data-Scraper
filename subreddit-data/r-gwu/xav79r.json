            "comment": "As someone who\u2019s swapped between both recently, they\u2019re both perfectly acceptable in both areas. T-Mobile has some weird quirks though, won\u2019t work in District and it won\u2019t cover parts of the national mall. Verizon\u2019s 5G is also significantly more available but def not a game changer. T-Mobile seems limited to UC 5G too and never UW, which Verizon has",

Including SEH, District, LLC, and a dozen others.  5G antennas on the Kogan side of Monroe/HoG, UYard, Smith Hall and Ross.",

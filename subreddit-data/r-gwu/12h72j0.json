You're getting 73K in free money and are offered workstudy.  They're paying most of your room and board.\n\nMy suggestion would be to try to not take that unsubsidized loan.",

One thing you should give close attention \u2014 there\u2019s still $5.5k in loans, and the $3,100 for FWS is an allotment of money dedicated to you, meaning you\u2019ll still have to get a work study job and earn your way up to that value. Otherwise, everything else is of no concern, so you can enjoy your time at GW!",

I did not take the fed unsub loan and I ended up paying \\~ $4500 out of pocket for the entire year. Federal Work Study jobs are really easy to come by at GW, all of them start at $16.10/hour and some pay more than that. Working a $16.10/hour one I was able to use all my money for the year working about 8 hours per week. It's a super super doable price, especially if your parents are willing to pick up any remaining costs. Don't take loans if you don't have to, and if you do, always go for the subsidized! Lmk if I can answer any questions!",

            "comment": "The cost of attending GWU includes estimated costs which may be lower for you. Your meal plan will be the first year required one that's 5,600 per year, but your housing cost depends on the dorm ([https://living.gwu.edu/2023-2024-housing-rates](https://living.gwu.edu/2023-2024-housing-rates)) so you might want to strategically rank them when registering for housing. \n\nBooks, fees, transportation, and personal expenses are all also estimates so that could vary for you. I haven't crunched the numbers but I received a similar package so I would assume you'd pay these out of pocket. Also, I think your out of pocket cost would add up to be less than 13k. And I agree with other commenters about not taking the unsubsidized loan since it has interest which would cost you more in the long-run.",

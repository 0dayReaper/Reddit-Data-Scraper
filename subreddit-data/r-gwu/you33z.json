It\u2019ll give you a good taste of what legal thinking and writing is like. And it\u2019ll give you familiarity with concepts and techniques (like how to Bluebook) that will give you an edge your first year of law school while everyone else is learning all that for the first time. \n\nThere were some (def a minority) of people in the minor that didn\u2019t have any intention to go to law school and still got a lot out of the classes. \n\nIn terms of the civics education and critical thinking skills, I think the minor taught me more than my poli sci major lol",

I got an associates degree from one and tbh the classes are a bit more laid back and less stressful. And I think that can be a benefit. \n\nI took classes at gw during the summer and there a bit hard and there a large time commitment. If you feel burned out by April than online classes aren\u2019t for you it\u2019ll only Make the fall Worse for you. And I\u2019m speaking from experience . Summer classes online have a higher tendency to me more strict and have a larger work load compared to an in person class in the fall and spring. And that just comes down to less time in the summer",

For me, the convenience of not having to get credits transferred, etc made the cost worth it, and it was also a required class for my major. I didn\u2019t think it was too bad because it was asynchronous, but keep in mind, you\u2019re cramming the same amount of info that\u2019s in a 15 week semester course into a 6 week summer course. So it ~feels~ like more work per day. That being said, for an intro class or a gen ed, if you find the cost trade-off worth it, I\u2019d say yeah they\u2019re pretty decent.",

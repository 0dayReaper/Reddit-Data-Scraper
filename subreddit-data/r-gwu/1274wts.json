The classes can get a little boring if you not excessively passionate about the subjects, but that\u2019s every class ever. Elliott holds many important events, talks, roundtables, research presentations. We also have a bunch of clubs and resources for students to use and be apart of. I view the alumni network and career opportunities in a positive light so far but I haven\u2019t engaged with them much. But most importantly, you benefit from what YOU choose to do. It\u2019s very much a choose-your-own-adventure here, so be excited and take advantage of everything here!",

My German classes are probably one of my favorite out of the required curriculum. Elliott school kids can vary, but the stereotype is real. A bunch of kids will come into class with suits and \"forget\" they're wearing their hillternship IDs. There is a heavy mixture in every class though, and often you'll be able to find likeminded people just about everywhere you go. lmk if you have anymore q's!",

I've really connected with a good amount of my teachers and have been able to build a solid circle of friends, contrary to what I've seen in many spaces regarding ESIA and GWU more broadly. The teachers I've connected with have all been willing to share their insight and knowledge. As many practitioners, my teachers insights have been monumental in preparing me to be ready to capitalize on the next opportunity and not necessarily handing me my next opportunity. So, you get out a healthy dose of what you put in. \n\nFurther, there are always events that are great times to expand your knowledge and build your personal networks. Go to events and connect with everyone you can.",

    "postText": "Hi! I am a current Highschool senior attending GW in August, so a rising freshman in the class of 2027. I am an avid biker and was wondering if \n\nA) I could have a bike on campus. Where does it get stored? Are dorms bike friendly? \nB) To any other bikers, what bike trails would you recommend. I generally bike for distance, so I don\u2019t do crazy hills, bmx, or mouton biking. \n\nThanks and Raise High!",

I think you can bike around Rock Creek Park, I don't believe it's solely walking trails. You'd be surprised how nice the green spaces are in DC, though it does take a bit of effort to actually find them.",

I\u2019ve visited a family member at GW twice and love D.C but felt very out of place, it seemed like everyone there grew up upper class. GW is one of the schools I\u2019m applying to but would like to find out more about life on campus for low-income students",

For me that looks like using the dining hall for almost every meal (since I\u2019ve already paid for it) and really saving throughout the week to splurge a bit if I feel like it on weekends. Depending on your schedule a part-time job is pretty doable while in classes whether it\u2019s through FWS or outside of school. The U-pass makes it so that you can still go explore and do free/low-cost activities without having to worry about travel costs. A lot of people at GW are wealthy enough to not have to worry about these things and their student life looks different but I feel like as long as you find ways to enjoy yourself and a supportive friend group you really don\u2019t feel like you miss out that much.",

            "comment": "In terms of fitting in, I found it VERY hard to relate to virtually any of my classmates because they truly lived in a completely different world than me. GW students, largely, are very sheltered upper middle/upper class children who have never felt a second of injustice or genuine struggle but will always be the first ones in the room to talk about how hard they have it. It made going to GW truly unbearable, and I genuinely hated a good chunk of my classmates due to their absolute ignorance and lack of real world experience. \n\nThat being said, there are students from working class families at GW, however I find that a lot of them really try to blend in as best as possible, so it\u2019s not easy to make a friend group of people from similar backgrounds. Finding on campus jobs really helped me find these people. \n\nBut at the end of the day, you need to go to college only for yourself. If that means going to GW just to add to your resume, then it\u2019ll ultimately benefit you in the long run, even if your time at GW isn\u2019t the most comfortable/welcoming.",

I enjoy it, but\u2026\n\nI would definitely encourage you to explore other options for your undergrad. Mainly because I can\u2019t fathom spending the amount that GW charges for a degree. In no way do I see a GW undergrad degree being worth the financial cost. Remember too, the cost of life outside of school is also extremely high in DC. So part of the cost of attending GW includes the DC cost of living. \n\nThere are plenty of top tier public schools in areas with much lower cost of living. \n\nAlso, I wouldn\u2019t knock GW just because many students come from wealthy families- I would describe it more as a \u201cculture shock\u201d than just specifically saying \u201cI don\u2019t fit in because I don\u2019t have money\u201d or something like that. Everywhere you go, there will likely be similar culture shocks or adjustments. At GW, family wealth is part of the culture shock (to me at least).",

            "comment": "Seconding finding other students with jobs. It became excruciating to be around the wealthy kids that would constantly complain about being so stressed and so tired and so busy and so broke only to find out that they are putting every single uber/meal/drink/activity/etc on their parents card and didn't have any other responsibilities besides just showing up to school. They would buy tables at clubs every weekend for thousands of dollars, and didn't have to think twice about whether or not they could afford to be included in the next round of social events. Finding people who \"get it\" and will also be looking for affordable fun and free activities in the city and who juggle different responsibilities besides just going to class will make things feel a lot less lonely.",

Otherwise, I would say that you\u2019ll find people who are similar to you eventually as you talk to other students in class. Not everyone is rich and pretentious. There\u2019s many people that are either from working class backgrounds or have rich parents that have them on a budget.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone, \n\nMe and a friend of mine are getting an apartment for next year, and wanted honest opinions and recommendations from those of you who live off campus. We are seriously considering Varsity on K (any honest takes appreciated) and wonder if there are any great already-furnished apartments you might know of. Also, any financial resources that are available for us to use?? Thanks so much in advance.",

I\u2019ve had good luck with Claridge (literally just 1 block down from varsity, lived there last year and living there this year too)\n\nClaridge is all individual landlords though, so the quality and price of each unit varies greatly \n\n&gt; any financial resources for us to use \n\nYour bank accounts? If you mean anything from GW, no. By going off-campus you have the privilege of not having your eyes ripped out by GW\u2019s dorming costs",

            "comment": "Varsity has BEAUTIFUL amenities and a great location. Unfortunately the management is really bad, it's insanely expensive (about twice the price as my studio was in Empire on 20th and F), and there are still bugs that sneak in from time to time. Maintenence is not very responsive to requests. I had a friend who lived there who's balcony door broke and she immediately filed a fix request and it took months for any progress to be made. I think her lease might have even ended before they got it fully resolved. In my opinion it's not worth the price, but if it's in your budget power to ya.",

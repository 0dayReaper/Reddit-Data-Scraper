    "postText": "I was admitted to GWU RD. I just got off the Emory wait-list and visited it this weekend. I'm very torn about which one to go to. The main draw for GWU is majoring in political science the opportunities being in DC has. I generally love DC as someone from a similar city myself. \n\nEmory on the other hand looked very very nice when I visited. We walked around the political science building and saw that it seems very nice as well, and supportive of student work. The vibe is completely different from DC, but I can still see myself having a ton of fun at Emory with the activities and other suburbs around it. \n\nFinancially they're very similar for me, so that's not an issue. \n \nGWU people, does being in DC and majoring in political science make some of the dorming/food issues worth it?\n\nI have around 24 hours to decide so any commentary is helpful.\n\nEdit: decided to stick with GWU, thank you all for the information and advice.",

What the classrooms and dorms look like really won't matter ten years down the road. Pick the school that has the future you want, not just the shiniest new building.",

There's this perception that depression is an Emory thing since there's pretty much nothing to do and the campus is dead and 20m away from the the actual city. If you don't drink you're pretty much screwed socially. \n\nYes, GW might be ranked lower, but for politics Emory is a shitshow, with a focus on qualitative sciences and with a few actual professors in the department. The only good thing about the department, I must say, is that according to a r/emory poster they're making 200+ classes graded easier than introductory ones (if you are obsessed with your grades), with the average GPA being much, much higher than other schools (proven by my personal experience as well). Also, apparently Emory has good stats when it comes to grad schools placements according to a tenured professor currently at Emory who graduated from Harvard.\n\nSo yeah, some downsides in both and this could be that \"the other side is greener\" or however the saying goes, but I deeply regret choosing Emory, and so do many of my friends with different majors.",

My professors have been awesome and there are plenty of cool courses to choose from. Georgia is also extremely politically important as a brand new swing state, which has caused a boom in political opportunities. Not gonna pretend it\u2019s comparable to what you\u2019ll find in D.C., but you can absolutely find cool internships and whatnot in Atlanta.\n\nTbh, I think it\u2019s silly that the other commenter is acting like Emory students are stuck in some barren wasteland. It\u2019s true that the campus is in its own bubble, but you can get into the city using MARTA or by taking a Lyft (prices aren\u2019t that bad if you go out with other people and split the cost). Seriously, a ten minute bus ride will take you to Little Five Points, one of the coolest neighborhoods in Atlanta. Emory also hosts events on campus that can be a lot of fun. Hell, some of my favorite memories are from just hanging out with my friends in their rooms. There are plenty of things to do if you\u2019re willing to put in a tiny bit of effort to access them. \n\nI\u2019d also push back on the idea that you\u2019re \u201csocially screwed\u201d if you don\u2019t drink. Yes, most people drink here. Most people drink at every single college in the U.S. Emory is by no means a party school, and if you choose not to consume alcohol, most people won\u2019t care as long as you don\u2019t judge them for making different choices. I have a friend who pretty much never drinks, but doesn\u2019t care if anyone else does and he has a strong social circle. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to discourage you from choosing GW, it\u2019s an amazing school for political science and D.C. is a fantastic city. Just wanted to throw in my two cents about life at Emory. Thanks for reading the essay lol.",

I also was accepted to both Emory and GW for grad school and will now be attending Emory in the fall! I figured I could give you some of my personal insight that might help you out! \n\nFor me a big part of that decision came down to finances. GW offered me a full ride and Emory would\u2019ve been 10k a year for undergrad. For grad, GW would\u2019ve been 4k a year and Emory offered me a full ride with stipend. \n\nHOWEVER! I truly believe my success in grad school admissions and securing a full time job after undergrad (making 85k with great benefits and fully remote) was only possible because of what GW offered me. I\u2019ll break it down into two different categories: \n\n1. Academics: GW is highly ranked for the program I was in during undergrad. Our professors are titans in the field and brought real knowledge into the classrooms. I just had a really positive experience with them so I retained information really well and in interviews when asked about my favorite articles or books or moment in history etc that related to my field of study I always had a lot to say that was substantive. GW is also super flexible with double majoring and minoring so I had a lot of opportunity to add a ton of skills to my resume (namely programming, GIS, other stuff like that). \n\n2. Internships/ recourses: I won\u2019t sugar coat this, GW career services sucks but being in DC during the school year allowed me to work full time internships that students at other schools would not have been able to take. I credit these internships for being the reason post grad life has been so easy for me. I honestly don\u2019t think there are many other colleges that offer the same professional experiences that GW does. \n\nUltimately I\u2019m happy I went to GW for undergrad even though I got into \u201ctop schools\u201d (like UCB, Emory, etc). For grad though, I am choosing Emory mainly for financial reasons as cost of living is lower and my scholarship is larger. BUT also there grad placements are better than GW for the specific geographic region and population I want to work with. If I wanted to do policy or management or stay in the northeast I\u2019d probably go to GW but I don\u2019t so Emory was the natural choice for me. \n\nDon\u2019t think about prestige, GW and Emory are comparable enough that it comes down to specific program options and student opportunities that are specific to what you want",

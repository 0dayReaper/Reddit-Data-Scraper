Maybe i\u2019m too late?\n\nI know people use storage squad, but it kinda weirds me out that you have to pay a $50 deposit before you can even pick the date for pick up. Any one know if they\u2019re good?\n\nAny one have any recks?",

I\u2019d just ask friends staying in DC to leave stuff in their apartment\n\nBut if you don\u2019t wanna do that, I\u2019d recommend one of the UHaul facilities around the city, they\u2019re super easy, just throw your stuff into an uberXL, throw it into a locker, and call it good",

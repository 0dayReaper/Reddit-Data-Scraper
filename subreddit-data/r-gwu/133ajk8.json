It\u2019s just the way to get things onto the Google suite is using that @gwmail.gwu.edu\n\nSo sometimes, if you\u2019re trying to share a Google doc or have access, it\u2019s better to use the longer one \n\nIf you are a student employee you will get an @email.gwu.edu and it can get a little confusing after that",

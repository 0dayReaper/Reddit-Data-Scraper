If you\u2019re looking to transfer for the fall 2023, most deadlines have passed, but you can try for spring 2024. You just have to look up the school and it\u2019s transfer deadline. Here\u2019s the GW page for the withdrawal process: \n\nhttps://studentsuccess.gwu.edu/undergraduate-withdrawal-process",

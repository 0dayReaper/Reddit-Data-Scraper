I don't really ever eat on campus at this point, but in general: ditch the dining hall model and move back to GWorld. GWorld supremacy.\n\nMy gf's take: include more small/local places with a variety of sit down and grab/go options. Every student is looking for something different from meal to meal. Include options with customization (like Kin's sushi had. Brink back Kin's and get rid of the dogshit new places in district). Ditch dining halls and shift back to GWorld",

I might be taking some classes here over the summer (Physics 220 and 221) and was wondering if there was a website where I can see course grade distributions and averages and stuff, like this one for UIUC courses: [https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/grade\\_disparity\\_between\\_sections\\_at\\_uiuc/](https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/grade_disparity_between_sections_at_uiuc/)\n\nThanks!",

Bill, so I can't speak to whether it was worth it. As a student there, I did land some awesome internships. Again, hard to say whether those were based on military experience, or being at GW. I was overwhelmed by the school, so I sought out stuff on my own. The professors (for the most part) were bona-fide in their fields and experience. And the schools proximity to DoS and DoD is baller, to be honest. My main gripe at GW was the students themselves. I found them to be insufferable in many cases. Crying about the injustice they've personally dealt with while spending their summers at a vacation home in Italy or wherever-the-fuck. It always felt like they were only at the school for jobs, nothing else.\n\nI'm doing my M.A. at Howard (in American history), and can't speak to living at HU or the overall undergrad experience, but I can say that the school itself has potential to be incredible. There are a lot of issues with school administration, and it sounds like they might be pretty stingy with financial aid, but the campus is gorgeous and the professors themselves really foster unique learning environments. The school has similar D.C. hookups that GW has, but because a lot of those workplaces continue to be white spaces, they're slightly different. The students at Howard fucking rock, despite the amount of bullshit they deal with. In contrast to GW, the students at HU are there to be there.\n\nI'm a white student, and if I had to pick a school regardless of program, I'd pick HU, despite\nIf I had to pick an IA school, I'd pick GW.\n\nHU and GW are great for different reasons.\nThey can also suck for different reasons.",

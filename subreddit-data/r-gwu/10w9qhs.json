He\u2019s very accommodating (I very last minute had to take my midterm on a different day and he was kinda annoyed I didn\u2019t let him know earlier, but he let me do it!) Pretty alright class if you have a good group",

Prequiz post quiz, lab notebooks need to be pre written with all procedures etc. There were 2 midterms and a final in BISC 1111 in Fall 22 and class average was in the 50s. Very generous curve. Somehow I came away with an A",

There are at least weekly graded homework assignments fro the ebook in Pearson so you do need to read the material closely for that. Also there are small group activities in lecture that are very difficult but the questions show up on the exams in the short answer section. Despite all, he is very very generous with the curve. It\u2019s just so much work between lecture and lab that it consumes everything..time wise. Manubay is a great lecturer, kind and understanding. Just know you are getting into what should equate to a 6 credit workload. Better to take if your other classes aren\u2019t too demanding, imo",

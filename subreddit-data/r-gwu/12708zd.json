            "comment": "So I tried doing this during my undergrad at GW and quickly learned that while they say they provide counseling that is only partially true. You can go for counseling but it will be a 20 minute discussion with someone who will provide little help if any and then they will give you a piece of paper with a list of therapists in DC who you can call/go to but at least when I went none of the people on the list they gave me were taking new patients. So it kinda felt useless, you\u2019re better off skipping that step and just searching for a therapist on your own to talk to, it\u2019s what you\u2019ll end up doing anyway after GWs \u201chelp\u201d",

At least it pointed me in the direction of new resources so it was a place to start, but it was a bummer overall. I\u2019d honestly give it a chance if I were you, worst thing that happens is you waste 50 minutes and you don\u2019t go back, best case is you find an incredible counselor that has your back.",

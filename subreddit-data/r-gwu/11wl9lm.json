As someone who is severely lactose intolerant, I cannot eat anything from the dining hall because of cross contamination and cooking with butter and milk and NOT labeling it. \n\nI\u2019m currently in the process of trying to get an appeal from the plans and it\u2019s a fucking pain. There are a bunch of other people that have similar problems with other allergies/intolerances",

DC is a big city with a ton to do and not all of your friends have to be from GW. \n\nThe vibe I\u2019ve gotten this semester is that many people are looking to make more friends but it can be awkward to bridge the gap post-Covid. If you take the initiative and plan events/invite a lot of people, enough of them will show up that it\u2019ll be a good time.",

    "postText": "\nSo I received $14K for the IB Scholarship as part of my financial aid package. I\u2019m a High School Senior and I really wanna go to GW. \n\nThe problem is, I\u2019m not an IB Diploma Student, it\u2019s just that most of my schedule is IB classes (I took 3 last year and 5 this year). This means whether I pass or fail the exams, I\u2019m not going to receive the diploma, I\u2019ll only get credit for passing the classes and exams. I\u2019m not sure if GW knows this. I mean, I\u2019m pretty sure they saw my transcript and saw  that I also have non-IB classes this year and last year so why should they assume I\u2019m in the Diploma program? \n\nI just want to know that if they are going to take my scholarship away. I really can\u2019t pay that $14K gap if they do.",

Most people can maintain at least a 3.0 gpa unless you\u2019re always partying and not doing your work. Many STEM classes curve so even if you do bad, you still have a chance.",

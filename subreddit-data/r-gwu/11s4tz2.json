    "postText": "The class is really challenging and a third of the class got below a 40 on the midterm. I'm wondering if the reason why there isn't a specific cutoff on the syllabus for an A, A-, B+ etc is because he changes it every semester. There is no curve for any of the exams, so I'm wondering if he changes the cutoffs so he doesn't have too many students failing. I know in my other math classes the cutoff for an A is a 95%, then 90%, 85% and so on, and I really hope that isn't the case in this class. What do you guys think?",

            "comment": "he curves the class at the end of the semester. It's a transition to upper-level mathematics which has a different approach to grading compared to just \"answer is right, answer is wrong\" to \"how was your approach and does it demonstrate mathematical maturity\". \n\nTBH you're kinda expected to do kinda terribly since it's not as familiar territory. FWIW I honestly didn't do that well on the exams but still passed. \n\nIf you're worried 100% go to his office hours or see your TA. Even if you're not worried you should go for the conversations and the chalk boards alone.",

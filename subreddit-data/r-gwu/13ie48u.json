I read here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/19YjUVM5hB3A84r4U1epG-E6Tobrlbmfe/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19YjUVM5hB3A84r4U1epG-E6Tobrlbmfe/view)\n\nthat there are only 2-person units. However, I've been assigned a \"1-Person Unit with Adjoined Bathroom\". Does this mean I'll have two beds in my room? My mom might visit for a couple days and I doubt we would fit on a twin lol.",

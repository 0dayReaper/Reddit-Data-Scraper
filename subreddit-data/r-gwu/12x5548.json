This obviously isn\u2019t true for some people, but my personal take (that a lot of my friends disagree with) is that if you love foggy, you won\u2019t love the Vern. And if you love the Vern, GW might not be the best fit for you. That\u2019s the broad issue, but a few of the more specific things about the vern/honors:\n\nThe vex commute sucks. It\u2019s not *that* big of a deal, but I got tired of it and I only had to do it for one class, for one semester. I can only imagine what going back/forth all year is like \n\nSince my freshman year, I\u2019ve only been back to the Vern twice. Once for a theater show, and then again for escape the Vern (it\u2019s a party theme some clubs do. As you can imagine, the whole idea is to get off the Vern ASAP). No one really *wants* to go to the vern\n\nSocially, there\u2019s really nothing going on on the Vern. Pretty much everything is on foggy \n\nThe only reason honors kids have to live on the vern is because the admin created a housing shortage on foggy and wants to mindfuck kids into thinking that living on the vern is a good choice. My freshman year, honors kids could live whenever, and they basically all chose to live on foggy. Because foggy is better \n\nThe only real pro to honors is priority registration (which only really matters for freshman year and then *maybe* sophomore year). The honors classes seem to be unnecessarily difficult, there seems to be a massive overlap between annoying elliott kids and annoying honors kids, and a good chunk of the honors kids I know dropped the program midway through because the requirements make no sense and add no value to your education",

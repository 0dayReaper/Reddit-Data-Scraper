    "postText": "Are there folks in the Doctorate of Eng program? Considering pursuing this degree after I finish my M.S. and would love to understand general sentiment, how technical it is, caliber of courses and peers? \n\nWould really appreciated any advice and thoughts as I push through my research phase of different programs. This one certainly stands out given its online/part-time optionality... trying to maintain a FT job given where the economy is at currently. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Two important questions to ask yourself:\n1. What do you hope to get out of a doctoral program?\n2. What do you plan to do once you finish school?\n\nIf the answer to #2 is anything other than management or cybersecurity, this isn\u2019t the program for you. If you don\u2019t want to go into a research position (academic or industry) and/or just want the piece of paper that says you\u2019re a doctor, this is probably a good way to do it. But to be blunt, in my opinion this program is a bit of a cash grab. While I understand that a PhD in e.g. electrical engineering and an EngD in electrical engineering are increasingly similar in terms of rigor, just with a slightly different research focus, I do not think that GW\u2019s EngD programs are even close to the same level as any of their engineering PhDs. Frankly I think it\u2019s laughable to compare the one year \u201cresearch\u201d portion of the EngD to the multi-year research effort that goes into a PhD project.\n\nSince you mentioned keeping a full time job as a requirement: it is absolutely possible to do a PhD at GW part time, it\u2019ll just take longer and funding is more complicated. But considering that you\u2019d be self funded for an EngD, it\u2019s probably no different. I\u2019d wager at least 30-40% of the PhD students in my lab (myself included) have worked FT engineering jobs at some point during the program. I\u2019d definitely recommend this approach if you\u2019re serious about a doctoral program and don\u2019t just want to rubber stamp it\n\nSource: peep the flair",

            "comment": "It's a 2 year doctorate. It's a total cash grab. My friend did the program. She told me the classes weren't very hard and the research wasn't either. At least you get to choose your research topic, and she did say they failed people at their defense, so it's not a \"gimme\" degree.  I'll admit I did apply and get in (7 YOE and MS in SE). Chose to go the PhD route instead (not at GWU).\n\nIt's worth pursuing if you want to stay in industry, but if you want to go into academia you'll want to get a PhD instead.",

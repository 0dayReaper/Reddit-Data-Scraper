    "postText": "Hi! Just got accepted ED2 w/ a good scholarship and am beyond ecstatic, I have a few questions for current students and hope you can answer them:\n\n\\- What would you say the overall community vibe is for GW? Do you feel close-knit?\n\n\\- Do you feel close with people in your dorms? Do you think it was easy to make friends?\n\n\\- How would you describe the overall area in general, I know there's ton of stuff to do but would you agree as well?\n\n\\- When do you begin to register for classes and dorms?\n\n\\- Would you say 6 classes in a semester for 18 credits is too much?\n\n\\- \\[Physics/Comp Sci Majors Only\\] How difficult do you find GW's curriculum to be?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you! And I'm sure I'll have more questions to come...",

Freshmen here, here are my answers :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Brutally honest, the community is not close-knit at all\n\n\\- Other than my roommate I am not close with people in my dorms and nobody talks to us lol. It's semi-easy to make friends, just open up \n\n\\-The area is very lively and active with political energy. There's a ton to do if you seek it\n\n\\- Literally don't know but they are currently redoing the housing system so do your research \n\n\\- I would say it's too much for your first year UNLESS you are very very good at planning and time management. But if you want to get used to everything stick to 5 classes",

You\u2019re much more part of the city than part of the college.\n\n2. I\u2019ve lived off campus, so can\u2019t comment on dorms but making friends via clubs has been very successful for me. \n\n3. I love DC. I love having an unlimited use metro pass. I get to go whatever I want, when I want. I have been all over the city, from bars, to museums, to restaurants. DC is an awesome city. \n\n4. See academic calendar, depends on credits.\n\n5. Depends on your courses and on your competence level. I\u2019ve done it but only for one semester and felt really burned out.\n\n6. If you\u2019re interested in physics and comp sci, you should really consider doing the data science major with a physics domain. Not only is our data science program really really good, you\u2019ll likely end up picking up a stats and math minor, and get paid more out of college too. I can\u2019t recommend the program enough.",

I\u2019m a pretty mediocre student and I\u2019ve got an offer clearing six figures atm. \n\nWhat you study in college doesn\u2019t really matter in the longterm, so I\u2019d recommend going with what will get your started out earning the most money + it has good upwards mobility.",

            "comment": "Congrats on getting in! \n\n1) as other commend have said, I don\u2019t think the overall campus community is close. generally GW has a very independent social vibe. I personally like this, I think there\u2019s less pressure to do social things you don\u2019t want to do (Eg, less pressure to attend parties if you don\u2019t like parting) but that\u2019s just my preference, I realize it isn\u2019t for everyone.\n\n2) during freshman year, I was close with the 3 other people in my individual room, although I didn\u2019t know that many people in my dorm. That being said, there were people in my building who did make an effort to make friends with me, so I guess the extent to which you make friends in your dorm depends on how compatible you are with the people in your building.\n\n3) definitely a lot of things to do, tons of museums, restaurants, concert venues, all in walking distance (or a 15 minute metro at most, and the metro stop is right on campus)\n\n4) classes are in August. I believe dorms are in July, but it might be earlier, I\u2019m not 100% sure \n\n5) I think 18 credits is too much, especially for semester one. It\u2019s good to nave that first semester to transition to campus and college life\n\n6) I\u2019m an IA major, so I can\u2019t offer insight there \n\n\nTake my answers (and everyone else\u2019s) with a slight grain of salt. This has been my experience, but my experience on campus is also shaped by the fact that I\u2019m a more awkward, shy, and introverted person. Someone who is more outgoing might have different thoughts about the social atmosphere on campus. But I think there is something here for everyone, you just have to find the communities your looking for",

Not at all lol - the vibe is niches\n\n2 No but I know people who are, depends on if you like them I guess\n\n3 You will get bored in Foggy - you will end up going to the white house or monuments about a dozen times in the first week and never return for months. Food is very mid, or expensive, or both. Go to the Georgetown area for shopping and human life. Foggy Isn\u2019t that dodgy, just sort of grimy and offices\n\nAugust for classes, July for dorms? Mid to late summer from what I remember \n\nTry to have fun with what you get, I know I haven\u2019t",

            "comment": "I can only speak for the physics dept as a grad student there. The faculty/professors are the for the most part very nice/understanding and down to earth. There are some undergrads who have had the chance to publish/present research posters at conferences as well. \n\nAs for difficulty of the classes, the intro classes will be hard - not because of the content - but these are your typical cookie cutter classes. Most profs will just read from the textbook and you won\u2019t get much out of it (but this was the case in my undergrad and in most colleges). The middle/upper level courses will see a lot of improvement- profs care, invest the time and expect you to do the same. \n\nAs a grad student looking in, I think the level of knowledge GW\u2019s dept offers is pretty good but more importantly they push for research (which is something my undergrad didn\u2019t do)",

Much of the value of college is making friends and contacts. \n\nYou'll probably make more friends from clubs you join than your dorm. There's pretty much a club for anything you're interested in. And you probably won't make any friends in the classroom unless the professor structures the class in a way that encourages socializing. My intro to photography class was great, as we would organize photo taking trips and photo shoots with each other.",

Georgetown definitely has some higher end stores but there\u2019s a Sephora as well but I would recommend the one on Connecticut ave it\u2019s a lot closer. Pentagon city mall is 15 minutes on the metro and you can definitely get some shopping done there. For Tyson\u2019s which is about 40 minutes with the silver line I would dedicate a whole day to because that mall is massive with any store you could possibly think of. Just remember that dc is a major city with many tourists from outside the US coming to go shopping and buy American brands so there is definitely no difficulty in buying what you want/need.",

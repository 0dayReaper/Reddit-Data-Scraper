Anyone have any super valuable experiences for a poli sci / international affairs major? I would think so, but i haven\u2019t heard of any yet.",

If no, don\u2019t overpay for study abroad programs, just go abroad yourself and do whatever you want for way cheaper \n\nI didn\u2019t get to study abroad because of Covid so I\u2019m just moving to Europe after graduation to work remotely. Way better than getting ripped off by GW to go to the same places",

            "comment": "Just to offer an alternative perspective, I felt like my study abroad experience as an international affairs major gave me great international experience that was helpful in getting internships and even jobs later on. I also even saved money not having to pay for GW's expensive ass housing (I studied in Senegal) and I got an extra scholarship to study abroad. It just depends on where you want to go and what you want to do whether it'll be worth it for you or not. I don't know if it's worth extending, considering the cost of that, but if you have a minor you're not too attached to, might be worth it to drop that. Just my opinion.",

These study abroad programs are very expensive, much more than just moving there or visiting for a summer. Study abroad doesn\u2019t matter to an employer. \n \nI am getting a one-year masters in Europe next year for under $20k including living expenses. This is a much better return on investment than spending 10 weeks in Spain/whatever and delaying your bachelors.",

Most masters in Europe are one year, teach in English, and are very cheap. At least in Sweden, they can only charge the exact amount that it costs a student to study at the university, which is about 7-8k a semester and rent is around $600/month. The investment is unmatched by a US grad school program, unless you are going into law or med. My equivalent program in the US would be 60-80k, not including living costs. I would definitely consider doing this if you are looking to get your masters anyways, and want to study abroad. Just google \u201cone year masters (field) (country)\u201d and see what comes up.",

TBH most of the people I know who did study abroad didn't gain anything out of it besides having a \"really cool vacation.\" In some cases it may be worth it, but it sounds like OP doesn't really even know what they'd get out of the program. As such - money down the drain.",

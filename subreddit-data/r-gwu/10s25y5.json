    "postText": "Hey all, I have DSS so choose housing next week. options are limited to Dakota, JBKO, FSK, and I-House. Asking for recs on how to rank. Dakota looks nice, JBKO is closest to classes for me but not sure if they\u2019ve done much maintenance in recent years..still any major pest problems, is being near the hospital and metro really loud? Same question about recent updates for FSK and I-House. Only other options are 1959E and Mitchell which are both really far from my classes in Columbian college. Thanks!",

It definitely sucked walking to class in the morning but the apartment was so nice I preferred it over something closer to my classes. Dakota would be the next best, JBKO, FSK and I House are pretty out dated. \n\nMy recommendation:\n\n1. 1959\n2. Dakota\n3. JBKO\n4. FSK\n5. I House",

Had to throw a 5th in there, so I added Shenkman which I know nothin about but has no singles so i figured it did matter. Only other Single option was Mitchell and really prefer not to live there so didnt put it on the list. Thanks all, for the advice:)",

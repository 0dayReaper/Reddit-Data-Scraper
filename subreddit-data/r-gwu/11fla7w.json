Everything else about being a transfer has been really good. GW took by far the most transfer credits out of any school I got into and was generous with financial aid. Let me know if you have any other questions.",

I'm p sure they do transfer orientation with freshmen orientation. there's also a Transfer Student Organization. For housing, its just any dorm that aligns with your year so if you're a sophomore you would be put in a dorm that is mainly sophomore'junior. but honestly if ur looking for a good college experience, don't transfer",

Your state school likely has a better engineering program, and it\u2019s probably a better option if it\u2019s cheaper. GW\u2019s program is quite small, which is great because you get much closer interaction with your professors and instructors, as opposed to being in a dynamics or circuits lecture with 200 other engineering students. The flip side is some of the specialized subfields aren\u2019t available, and employers don\u2019t give it as much attention in terms of recruitment; they tend to focus on UMD and GMU. The lack of a co-op program is also a pretty significant downside in my opinion. That said, it\u2019ll certainly prepare you to get a good engineering job when you graduate",

I have to say, outside of computer and electrical engineering, the gender demographics are far more balanced than most schools. A few majors having what seems to me like more women than men. If you want to do BME, that\u2019s a pretty big program (for an engineering school of this size) and is the more specialized of the majors within engineering.",

            "comment": "I currently live in district and me and one of my roommates wanted to see what it was like in affinity housing. You can literally take the elevator. knock on the door, and they\u2019ll let you in unless there\u2019s an event going on. It\u2019s basically a large one floor house with a large kitchen and dining area. Everyone lives in their own 2 person bedroom and each bedroom has a mini fridge and 2 dressers. If you want to live with 19 other people that are in the same community with you (LGBT, ethnicity, women, etc.) then affinity is the place for you. I know that the application process is easy I think you just need to contact the person in charge and they\u2019ll give you the info. Usually you apply during the normal housing application window (March-April).\n\nYou can find the info for all the affinity on the GW housing website I believe. Hope this helps!",

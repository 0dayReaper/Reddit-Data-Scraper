Front row center is Hans Bethe; to the right are I.I. Rabi, Niels Bohr and Felix Bloch; behind Dr. Bohr to the right is George Gamow. Edward Teller is in the 2nd row from the back, near the center, with face partially hidden. Eugene Wigner is on left in 2nd row.\n\nAlso, (I forget which year), but the physicist who theoretically calculated that and worked out how nuclear fission would release loads of energy (ie, the nuclear bomb), was delivered at GWU.",

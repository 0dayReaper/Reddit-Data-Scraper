    "postText": "Hi everyone!! I just moved to DC from California and am going to be starting at GWU next week as a non-degree student, but technically as a freshman and am planning on becoming a full time student for Fall 2023, and am a bit nervous about connecting with other freshmen, especially since I'm starting spring sem and not fall sem like most students. If anyone else is starting this spring, or just is down to meet/make some new friends, comment and I'd love to meet you and talk, or we can make a groupchat if there's enough of us!\n\nI'm planning on majoring in Women and Gender Studies and am passionate about anything related to the queer community (proud lesbian here!) and women's rights and am also a second-gen immigrant and Chinese and Jewish, so if anything in there sounds like we might get along, feel free to message me! Can't wait to meet y'all next week!",

I interned in an EU embassy (not a citizen) over the summer and it was super easy to get \n\nState/FS is a toss-up. Now that the program is paid, they just accept way fewer applications every cycle, but they still expect you to work 32-40 hours/week. If you work in DC, you may/may not be able to still take classes FT, that depends on what classes you need and how much you can juggle the work \n\nIf you end up at a post abroad, you\u2019re gonna wanna take time off\n\nAlso, by the time you\u2019re able to apply this probably won\u2019t be an issue, but the clearance process has been super backed up since COVID. I had to turn down an internship at State because they didn\u2019t get me my clearance until after the semester had started. A friend of mine dealt with the same issue this semester",

Not sure what the process is for getting in one of those, but that automatically gets you a massive friend group from day 1 \n\nIf I had to go back in time to freshman year and pick one of the dorms that\u2019s available this year, I\u2019d probably go for Potomac, Madison, or Laf (in no particular order)\n\nEdit: apparently JJ is a freshman dorm next year?

So far, I've enjoyed my classes and professors too. From my personal experience, I found that the only classes I have difficulty with are the Honors classes. So, as long as you're not in the Honors program, the classes are definitely manageable (that being said, I'm not a hard stem major like in SEAS or anything soo). Also, a lot of GW students don't have classes on Fridays, or if they do, it's only like a lab or discussion section. For me, that's a plus in terms of study vs social life balance too.",

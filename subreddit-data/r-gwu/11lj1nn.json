    "postText": "Hi all, I'm an accepted student for the computer science PhD program on a prestigious fellowship, and I want to get a holistic view of the department from the perspective of current students (both undergrad/grad) before making a final decision. \n\nHow are your relationships with your professors, and how has the department been treating you overall? Any particular courses you liked/disliked?\n\nGeneral advice/knowledge would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

            "comment": "Overall grad program itself is pretty decent. The profs in the core classes have been extremely tough and not very forgiving, some are nicer than others, but still. Elective profs have been a bit better in my experience. Algorithms and architecture class have been the absolute hardest so far for many. Some of the faculty have been extremely brutal and rude, others are nicer. It\u2019s really a hit or miss, but there does seem to be some sort of \u201cI think I\u2019m better than you\u201d running through the department",

    "postText": " Hey Everyone I thought I should  introduce myself. My name is George and I lived in the DC, Maryland,  Virginia(DMV) area for over 20 years.\n\nI am launching a community called Mint swe.\n\nIts an in person community for aspiring software engineers with the intention of practicing interviews.\n\nIf you are struggling with interviews and are looking for like minded people feel free to join us. Its a judgement free zone.\n\nWe plan to be on campus.\n\nI decided to start this because the journey to become a Software engineer can be a rough and lonely one.\n\nIf you are interested and want to learn more sign up at [mintswe.com](https://mintswe.com/)\n\nI  want close by saying the membership is reflective of the equipment such  as white boards, reserving the room, and taking uber and bus back and  forth to be on campus just to name a few\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/evummrv62fba1.png?width=1294&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=50b86e1b92de1ca276e68b0df4f0267b83334222",

    "postText": "Recently (late April 2022), staff and faculty received a disturbing letter from the office of the president. The letter started off by saying that there were no threats and absolutely nothing to worry about. Uh oh. It then went on to report that during a campus event, a loaded magazine from a semi-automatic weapon was found and turned in to campus police. Next President Ochoa reports, \u201cUniversity Police contacted all individuals seated in the immediate vicinity of the location where the magazine was found. After the search, Police did not identify any other contraband or potentially dangerous materials. Lacking further evidence, no indication or potential threats of violence, and having no suspect, Police cleared the area, and normal operations resumed.\u201d It repeated twice more that there was nothing whatsoever to worry about. Wait, what? In an era when school shootings are a weekly occurrence in the U.S., a loaded firearm magazine was found during a campus event, and police looked around, didn\u2019t find an active shooter and so concluded there was no danger? What kind of upside-down world are we living in? After this, and the lack of any consequences whatsoever for campus police or the president\u2019s office, I no longer felt remotely safe on campus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n2p0hksn6i291.png?width=990&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ba96c9b26679065864ed698276823e436e13d974",

I remember something from last year where they found that someone had been living in east campus with white supremacist posters and stuff, along with supplies to make a ghost gun. I also don\u2019t think we got an email about that because I also saw it for the first time when someone on this subreddit linked a news article",

I don\u2019t work in law-enforcement, so I can\u2019t say with 100% certainty what would happen, but at UCSC when there is even a semi-credible threat, all business as usual stops until they\u2019re absolutely certain there is no remaining threat. If events needed to be postponed, or buildings needed to be evacuated, that is certainly inconvenient, but not nearly as inconvenient as an active shooter. CSUMB police and administration acted irresponsibly and cavalier about our safety.",

    "postText": "Okay, so I\u2019m currently freaking out right now. So, I sign in to my oasis and I decide I\u2019ll check the financial aid tab for this next year, and I find that the awards that I previously had IS NOT THERE. Like it\u2019s just GONE. DISAPPEARED. THERES NO AWARD DETAIL THERE ANYMORE. \n\nAgain, currently freaking out here. I\u2019ve talked about the thing with financial aid a while ago as well, when it was greyed out, and many people said that it was just an estimate (understandable) and that they would probably do a better estimate of the money that I\u2019ll get later. \n\nHOPEFULLY, it\u2019s just that? That they\u2019re recalculating my award detail? Idk, I just don\u2019t wanna fuck up my chances. I really need that money. Someone bring me back to logic lwjfkekfef aaahhhhhh h",

Instead they play a voicemail saying that they\u2019re lower staffed because of COVID, which is definitely understandable. As soon as I found out, I sent an email, asking what happened. Hopefully I get answers to this. I\u2019m trying to stay calm because they wouldn\u2019t just fuck me over like this hopefully, haha.",

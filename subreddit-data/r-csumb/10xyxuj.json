    "postText": "I might be going here as a freshman next year, my first choice was cal poly humboldt but the housing crisis is the worst I have seen so Im looking into other schools I have gotten into. I have heard MB has a pretty quiet campus, which is alright since I am not a partier. Also, how bad is the housing crisis here? Besides the thing with billing earlier this year, I havent heard much. I want to be a marine biology major, and I know monterey is a GREAT place for that, so do you think the cons would be worth it? pro and cons lists about the school would be appreciated\u2026I am VERY stressed about figuring out where I am going to go.",

It\u2019s possible to use the bus and get around but having a car is way more convenient here\u2026 just my personal opinion\u2026 you\u2019re right about this school being great for marine biology majors if housing won\u2019t be an issue here and you really want to come then come \u2026. I\u2019d recommend coming to tour the school before you settle on coming here",

            "comment": "Okay everyone is being kinda negative so I\u2019m gonna stick up for a couple things I loved about housing here, take it from another student who came here specifically for the housing perks. The dorms are not that bad imo. They\u2019re not new in anyway and they do get construction problems frequently, but I think having a bathroom in your room as a freshman is worth everything. I don\u2019t know how people survive without a sink in your room I\u2019d be dehydrated immediately. There are a lot of housing options for future years too. I personally hate North Quad but a lot of people like it, I just think it\u2019s dingy and a lot of them don\u2019t have a full kitchen. But you can choose between that or dorms again. Then you can live in promontory which is a really nice place to live. It\u2019s a new building, under ten years old I think, and has in unit washers and dryers, full kitchen, furnished living space and rooms. It also has its own small little gym and place to pick up packages, and isn\u2019t a far walk from main campus. Then there is east campus, where I\u2019m currently at. These places are massive and about an eight minute drive to campus. If you want to live here all the years you\u2019re here, you 100% can. I\u2019ve never heard of anyone getting denied housing, and I used to work in the housing department on campus. You just might not get your first choice. The downsides I see is the roommate process is dumb and it\u2019s mostly randomly assigned. It\u2019s also the most quiet campus ever so if you\u2019re outdoorsy and feel confident in being able to make your own friends, then this would work for you but if not it can be difficult for some people because it\u2019s hard to meet people here. You also 100% are gonna want a car or pray to god your roommate and you are besties and they have a car. Check out the prices on the housing page of the website! Compare them to the other schools you\u2019re looking at. Living on campus is cheaper than off campus most of the time and the places here are nice in my experience! I think the price is pretty good comparatively but it\u2019s been forever since I last looked. Anywhere in California is expensive to live, everyone complains about the prices everywhere interesting to live, look it up for yourself. The housing office is also super responsive if you have questions you can email them and they\u2019ll respond within 24 business hrs with helpful info usually. Humboldt is way worse than here you\u2019re not gonna be homeless here, Monterey specifically has so many options because they used to have a homeless student population so they built more buildings, and humbodlt has not done that",

When you live in the dorms actually all the main buildings are placed around the dorms, so the dorms are the center of campus and you can get to some classes in like 2 minutes. It\u2019s just outside of campus that is hard without a car. Like it\u2019s a 40 minute walk to target I think and the stores around it, but the closest grocery stores you\u2019ll have to drive to. Or figure out the bus but I don\u2019t know anything about that or where it goes.\n\nFor housing, they\u2019ll email you in maybe April or May about housing, I think for freshman it\u2019s May. And then you can apply for it, it\u2019s pretty straight forward unless you\u2019re trying to pick a roommate then it\u2019s a bit harder but not impossible or anything",

I have not lived in the dorms but from an outside perspective, I don't think Monterey is as bad as Humboldt though it certainly has it's own issues, as does every other UC/CSU. If you are worried about housing since Monterey requires first years to live on campus, I would consider attending a community college for a year or two and transferring in. You'll save a lot of money since you'll be taking the same classes as you would here but at a cheaper rate. Of course, the choice is up to you.",

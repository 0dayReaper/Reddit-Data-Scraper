    "postText": "I have a cat that I\u2019m interested in registering as an ESA, but I\u2019m wondering how the process went for anyone who has one on campus? I live in the residence halls btw.\nAlso, does anyone know any ESA trained medical professionals in the area or basically anyone who can prescribe me an ESA. From the therapists I\u2019ve seen, none would sign off because of my hospital\u2019s policies with ESA\u2019s.",

More than likely you'd need proof and have a history with a therapist or long history of treatment before they'd probably let you have an ESA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is what I remember from roughly 4 years ago so I may be wrong all I remember is they were dicks about it. If you go through with it don't take their shit clap back on them if they are being difficult. The ADA protects your rights in this regard from being discriminated against by the school so I'd tell them if they're being difficult that you'll get an attorney because the last thing the school wants is to get sued.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce student housing entered my house in east campus(without 24h notice) and I had a camera recording of them going in and they got us for some violation or other but I emailed the Community director and roasted him and he didn't even respond and they never followed up or got us in trouble because they know what they did was illegal don't be afraid to roast on them because this school has gotten so booty in the last few years more like a business than an accommodating educational institution.",

However, the Fair Housing Act does and they should follow it given you\u2019re able to provide evidence supporting your need for an ESA. Best of luck!",

    "postText": "I\u2019m living in East Campus and am looking for some advice on renting a washer and dryer since I live pretty far from the laundry area for my park. Buying a used washer and dryer is kinda out of the picture since it\u2019s just me and live in an upstairs unit, so it might be hard to bring it up by myself. Does anyone have any recommendations?\n\nI was going to try to go with Appliance Warehouse of America since I saw the ad for it when filling out paper work to move in, but after reading some bad reviews on google and yelp I\u2019m kinda iffy about it. Has anyone had any bad experiences or positive experiences with them? \n\nIf you have any other recommendations for places to rent from, I\u2019d appreciate it!",

            "comment": "Yeah I used them for my couple semesters. The washers worked fine and the guy who installed even asked me if I wanted to be shown how to use them! It was really nice. I even put them thru a roomate disrespectful about sharing something I was renting. I never said anything because meh. they constantly over stuffed the washer and it was fine. The pick up was no problem but you do have to call them. You can order them online no problem but returning them was kinda annoying/ inconvenient. I also returned during covid with no issues. Really chill dude who does the pick ups. I was like sooo I left the apartment weeks ago and there shouldn\u2019t be laundry in my machines but I dunno cuz I have been there in weeks and he\u2019s like it\u2019s okay!  No worries.",

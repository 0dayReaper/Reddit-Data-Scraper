    "postText": "I recently got accepted to CSUMB, which is one of my top two schools that I wanted to go to as a marine science student. I've been to the Monterey area several times before, and I was wondering what the benefits of living in an apartment on campus is versus living off campus? \n\nFor those of you attending who currently live in an apartment on campus: \n-What do you like &amp; dislike about it? \n-Are the faculty fairly responsive if/when an issue arises (ie: something breaking, roommates, loud neighbors)\n-What is the roommate selection process like? (ie: how many people to an apartment, can you room with people that have similar hobbies or are also LGBT?)\n\nFor those of you attending who currently live in an apartment off campus: \n-What do you like &amp; dislike about it? \n-How does your rent compare to living on campus? \n-Are the staff fairly responsive if/when an issue arises (ie: something breaking, roommates, loud neighbors)\n-What apartment complexes do you recommend and why? \n-Which apartment complexes should I absolutely stay away from? \n\nKeep in mind I already live in California and have my own car, so travel wouldn't be an issue for me. Ideally I would like to live near or on campus with other LGBT students.",

Hasn\u2019t happened in a while though so maybe he got busted. Worst part is the furniture. The bed sucks. I ended up thinking about the compared cost of staying where I am and getting my own bed vs moving and getting all new furniture and finding storage when I\u2019m done with it or the work of selling it, so I just got my own full size. \n\nI had absolutely zero say in my roommate, and was very disappointed as a trans person to discover that I am listed as male, and they saw no issue rooming me with a male roommate. Obviously, you won\u2019t have my specific roommate, but he sucks. I\u2019m a rule breaker too though since my girlfriend is over all the time so there\u2019s nothing I can do without that being brought up. \n\nThere really isn\u2019t a huge active lgbt presence on campus and the lgbt living learning community is in the residence halls which totally suck so don\u2019t even try that one.",

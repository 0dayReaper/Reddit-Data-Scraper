    "postText": "Hey, I\u2019m considering transferring to CSUMB for Biology this upcoming Spring 2023. I\u2019m currently a SJSU student but I drive from Monterey to SJ 2-3 days a week and it\u2019s honestly not fun. Is anyone here a Biology major? How rigorous is it and how has the experience been for y\u2019all this far. I\u2019m planning to take 16 units per semester with winter and summer classes to graduate by Spring 2024! How has y\u2019all\u2019s course load been and how stressful has it been for y\u2019all. I have taken a few Biology courses so far at local community colleges at MPC and I would say I\u2019m decent at it just a lot of studying for me for sure, since it\u2019s takes me a while to grasp sometimes. Any feedback would be awesome much appreciated. :D",

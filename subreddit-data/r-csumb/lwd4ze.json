The only catch id say is it\u2019s hard to make friends in east campus.\n\nIf you wanna experience the sort of classic college dorm life go to Yarrow or North Quad. Yarrow is sorta the party dorm where you\u2019ll make lots of friends, and I think it\u2019s the only dorm that is not freshman except sanderling but sanderling is terrible.  Then north quad is sorta a halfway between the dorms and east campus in that you have more space and a kitchenette but it\u2019s still more restrictive",

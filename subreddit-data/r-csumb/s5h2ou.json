    "postText": "If you park at CSUMB, I'm guessing like me, you've received the occasional ticket. Have others had the experience of\n\n* Receiving unjust or erroneous tickets?\n* Receiving your first courtesy notice from the PMB AFTER the dispute period has already expired?\n* Had disputes ignored or denied without cause?\n\nI am furious at this company used by CSUMB PD to service their ticket collections and their predatory practices.\n\nFun fact: Did you know your teachers have to pay for parking at CSUMB same as students? That is, they have to pay to go to work.",

Managers pay about 3 times more than staff does due to making more money. \n\nYesterday I saw parking services approach a car that had a permit so I inquired why they are getting a ticket. The lady pointed out that the permit had expired and they had placed a warning on the windshield a week ago. I've NEVER been issued a warning, just straight up tickets, so I actually think they give people way more slack than any other place I've ever parked in my life.",

I think there is a wide gulf between the parking enforcers (CSUMB employees who we potentially see face-to-face and may be able to hold accountable) and the private company that processes those tickets for CSUMB (private, not associated with CSUMB, wholly unaccountable, and incentivized to maximize the money collected on every ticket). The organization that I've had the most challenges with, unsurprisingly, is the ticket collection company.",

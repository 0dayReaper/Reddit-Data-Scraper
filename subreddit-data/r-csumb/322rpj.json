Santa Cruz is really good but you are right in that you could end up getting bored if you only stay in one place.\n\nMany of the students go to the beach, but I've known a lot who go hiking or even down in Big Sur and Carmel. The sites can be really great with good weather, too. Water here is generally colder, but we have a great scuba diving series offered as well.\n\nDating and social scenes aren't spectacular. About 60/40 girls and many of the students are commuters from Salinas and that area so the campus can seem a little dead at times. Not a big deal if you're commuting yourself though. Like the other person said, it's best to find a few people from your classes who you get along with well and do things with them.",

You pretty much have drive 5 minutes to fund something fun to do around here. \nAs for social life, on my experience, it's more like people keep to themselves and there isn't usually much to do. \nHopefully that helps",

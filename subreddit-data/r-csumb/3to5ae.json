    "postText": "Hey all, my name is Tommy and I'm a cinematic arts major. Some of my current roommates are graduating, and I need a new place to rent with some other students. I've emailed people on craigslist, people on campus, pretty much everyone I know. \n\nDo any of you know someone who is looking for a roommate? I'm a more quiet person, both working and going to school, so I like to spend my free time relaxing by reading and listening to music. I'm clean and responsible with chores and whatnot. \n\nI would appreciate it if anyone knew of an available room! Thank you!",

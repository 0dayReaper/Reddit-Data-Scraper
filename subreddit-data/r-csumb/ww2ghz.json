    "postText": "I have been working on this app for a while now and I am really excited to share it with you. It's a college marketplace restricted to students. You can buy, or sell anything you want to other students, ranging from dorm supplies, textbooks, lost&amp; found, promote services, tutoring, apparel (anything really!) ride-sharing, to subleasing or finding off-campus housing for next year ... you can also swipe through profiles to find friends &amp; roomies!\n\nMake sure you check it out if you need anything for the upcoming semesters! You can only log in once you verify your **csumb.edu** school email! (you'll receive a 5 digit code in your inbox)\n\nlink to the app: [https://collegesouk.com/](https://collegesouk.com/) and tell your friends!\n\nalso maybe follow on ig [https://www.instagram.com/collegesouk/](https://www.instagram.com/collegesouk/) ?\n\nHope it helps ! - might be a little glitchy on galaxy hoping to fix that soon, also just want to mention that the idea is abstracted to support multiple universities :) each university got its own separate marketplace!\n\nAlso, please dm me if you have an idea on how I can let more students know about this or if anyone is interested in contributing! (app dev or social media/marketing)",

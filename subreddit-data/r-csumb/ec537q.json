Many computers have Adobe Premiere and Avid Media Composer. \n\nThe film department just got a new building and, and they have a big ass green screen. \n\nAlso, on our school cable network we have a TV channel that broadcasts student films 24hrs a day. \n\nThe library has dedicated labs just for editing. \n\nI would try to take a tour on campus if you could. The school can be a little ramshackle at times, but that's why it's so cheap. (and part of the fun)",

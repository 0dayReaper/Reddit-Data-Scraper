I am wondering if anyone has any experience with the quality of the actual housing, the selection process, costs (current), etc. Is there childcare on campus? \n\nAny and all feedback is greatly appreciated.",

            "comment": "You'll likely be in what is called east campus, a bunch of mostly apartment style housing over many courts, located east of the main campus. Different sections are generally used for different types of students/staff, so you will likely be around other family housing students. The apartments themselves are pretty good, nothing super fancy but also not too old. Price is normally cheaper than surrounding options, and is one of the closest to the campus.",

Also, being \"family housing\" would we be able to live there year-round or will we have to leave each intersession (winter/summer) or, how does that work?\n\nThanks again and I look forward to hearing back from you.",

If you have dog, most likely you will be placed in the 1st floor (same floor plan w the second except for the backyard). I enjoyed staying there; price is much cheaper compared to surrounding areas. You need a car tho because it\u2019s not very walkable.",

I heard many complaints about The Wave (the bus to go to Main Campus from EC), but they are relatively new so it may be better in the future. Idk how much it is now since it increases yearly, but you have a rent lock option (rent doesn\u2019t increase during your school program). Best of lucks and happy new year!",

For normal student rates that sounds about right.  if you work for CSUMB it becomes much cheaper.  My unit was $2250 but that got reduced to $1798.  Decent savings if you ask me.  This was for the 3 bedroom 2.5 bath option but I believe you MUST be an employee to qualify for those homes.  Feel free to DM with any more questions.  If I don't know the answers I am sure I work with those that do.",

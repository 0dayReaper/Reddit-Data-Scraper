    "postText": "Hello Otters! I'm an incoming transfer (Junior, CS major) and I was just wondering what you all's experiences with housing at CSUMB have been and what you recommend. I have thoroughly read through the various options on the website but I wanted to get advice from people who have actually lived at CSUMB.\n\nI'll tell you a little bit about what I'm looking for:\n\n* Spaciousness\n* Cost effectiveness (including a potential meal plan)\n* Fast wi-fi\n\nThings I'm not prioritizing/don't care much about:\n\n* The \"college experience\" (been there, done that)\n* Transportation time (I'm probably going to have my car)\n\nRight now I have it down to the Promontory and East Campus, and I'm leaning towards East Campus but I'm a little worried about their internet speeds and the lack of an in unit washer/dryer. If you've lived at either of these places, or anywhere else on campus, please leave your experiences down below!",

People from promontory tend to be upper class and really bitchy. \n\nIf you want real people, real hard-working people with grit. Then come on down to East Campus. I'm on Fredericksburg, we work hard and play hard. \n\nMost people would kill to pay $580 rent in California.",

The rooms in east campus are fairly large and its basically sharing a giant apartment but cheaper than other housing. You can also get any meal plan to suit your needs in east campus and aren't forced to get it.\n\nThe internet is 100down 3 up now after the upgrade",

Mine is hella fast, brought my own router and put myself on my own channel. $595/mo for double is amazing and you can lease a washer/dryer like I am right now thru a company that works with the campus. We are paying $20/mo for them but that's split 3 ways cus my roommates use them too. East campus you don't have your own bathroom like promontory though. Prom is aight. Def got nicer couches at prom. Also, I'll see you next year probably! I'm a CS major too and I'm pretty active among the CS students here.",

I don't know if this is up your alley, but do you know of any tutoring opportunities on campus in either Math/Phys/CS? I'm looking for a chill part time job in between class/studying.",

            "comment": "Based on the 3 things you\u2019re looking for, I\u2019d definitely recommend East Campus. \n\nSpace: Whether you\u2019re in a double or single bedroom, you\u2019ve got a good space and the rest of the unit is even bigger. Even with furniture, the living room is roomy and you still have the dining room. Plus the laundry room, this little \u201cstorage\u201d room off the laundry leading to the garage, the garage (my roommates and I use it as extra storage and a hangout space because we park our cars outside) and a backyard or porch depending what floor you\u2019re on. \n\nCost: EC is half the price of prom with more space along with free parking whereas prom is paid and limited. There\u2019s a kitchen so you\u2019re not required to get a meal plan, but you can if you want. \n\nInternet: connection is great, you do have to get your own router, but I\u2019ve never had connectivity problems and it\u2019s not slow. \n\nTransportation: like I said free parking and depending on which EC court you live on, you\u2019ll likely have a convenient spot nearby. There\u2019s also a free bus service to and from campus. Even though I have a car, I use the bus nearly every day because it\u2019s convenient and I didn\u2019t think the main campus parking permit was worth it. CSUMB has a lot of parking, but not a lot of close and convenient spots. In other words, you might have to walk quite a bit from the parking lot to your classes. We were also voted one of the most bike-friendly campuses, if that\u2019s of interest to you. Personally, I think biking from East to Main Campus is some real work, but there are a bunch of people who do it. So it\u2019s up to you, but you have options.\n\n\nAnd welcome to CSUMB! I hope you like it here. I\u2019m also a transfer and have had a really good experience thus far =)",

And I love that it\u2019s family and 21 and up so you don\u2019t have to deal with freshmen or sophomores. And at least on my court the RA is very sweet and holds events all the time but doesn\u2019t get in your business.",

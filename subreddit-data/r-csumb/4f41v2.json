I did have an issue where at first they thought I didn't do those Golden Core classes because I took a combined 2 year class to cover them all. Hopefully they sorted that out and I'll hear back soon. I'll try to remember to message you when I do find out one way or another so you have a heads up on checking with them too!",

Then when I completed my final transfer classes that June and sent official transcripts I got my official acceptance letter. It may depend on when you submitted all of your paperwork. My recommendation is to give it until May, and if you haven't gotten anything by then you might want to give the admissions office a call. There's a possibility they're backed up, since CSUMB is trying to grow their enrollment.\n\nGood luck! =]",

    "postText": "I'm a transfer student who joined CSUMB during the Fall '20 semester and because of COVID I've been attending classes online. With all my classes now in-person I'm forced to live on-campus (which is an ordeal of its own since everything is automated and there's no one to help) and I'm confused by the meal plans offered.\n\nAre meal plans per-semester or yearly? Is there any reason not to get Otter 7 since the others in the same price range give less for the same cost? Is Otter 7 worth it or can you get by with Otter 225 or something similar?\n\nIs Dining Dollars something akin to like, paying for an on-campus Subway specifically or something?\n\nI spent 2 months trying to change my housing from East Campus unfurnished to Promontory and finally got it. Because my classes are being paid via Pell Grant and I got a payment extension, I'm not sure if it interfered with anything or not but I'm not sure where I go to pay for my housing. I was told by someone in the housing department via email that it's located on OASIS -&gt; Make a Payment but no further instruction was provided and nowhere on there is the bill for housing. If there's one thing I can count on it's that they'll want their money so I know I'm not getting free board and this is an issue but I don't know what the process is for finding and paying this.\n\nSimilarly, because it took two months plus to change my housing and I only received confirmation on the evening of August 10th that I would indeed be in Promontory, I wasn't able to purchase a Promontory parking permit. Going to the parking permit site, Promontory isn't listed as an option. The main page claims that if the parking pass for the place you'll be living in isn't available, email them. I did so and received an auto-reply dated today (August 12th) saying that there was a small amount of Promontory Fall parking permits left on the site and redirected me there, although this is a lie since the option doesn't exist on the website.\n\nOn Monday I have a meeting with a Student Success advisor (I'd do it on Friday but it seems like the only person available for that is someone who does METAS and I think that's not applicable in my case) to hopefully answer these questions but that still gives me less than a week to answer my questions since I move in on the 20th and am driving in from Oregon.\n\nAnswers to any of these would be greatly appreciated as I'm currently at the mercy of the speed of whoever answers the multiple emails and phone calls I've already sent out.",

Try digging around on the site for it, it might help with your decision. Also about the parking I would just call so they can\u2019t go back and forth with automated emails",

            "comment": "\u2022 As cheap as a CSU can get, which is always a good thing. You\u2019ll still end up with a degree and (probably) with a lot less debt/maybe none at all (depends on your personal situation). \n\n\u2022 Lovely campus, pretty isolated. Really beautiful during the day, fairly scary-looking at night. \n\n\u2022 A lot of nice people and caring professors. \n\n\u2022 As a smaller school, you\u2019ll pretty much end up in a lot of classes with a similar group of people. In General Ed. classes/lower division/dorms you\u2019ll meet people from other majors but when you transfer in/become upper division, most of your classes are within your major. It\u2019s really nice because you\u2019re generally a tight-knit group and/or take the class/each other more seriously since you\u2019re in the same boat and tend to have similar interests.\n\n\u2022 I don\u2019t live on campus or am part of any affiliations/clubs/etc. so I don\u2019t know much about campus social life. A lot of people seem to care more about their classes and keeping tabs on people, so you\u2019ll probably be more likely to hit the books and help each other out than party. Keeping a balance is key; party when you\u2019d like to and make plans with friends to catch up, but don\u2019t mess around to the point where you\u2019re failing at the end of the semester and have no idea where to even go from there. \n\n\nBest wishes and good luck regardless of what you choose! :)",

They really want to help you succeed and can be pretty flexible\n   * Unfortunately, that means they are often poached by bigger schools and you'll find the faculty churns quite a bit (the plant pathology profs got recruited by two different top 5 plant pathology schools in my time)\n* If you are interested in research at all in the future there is a great organization on campus, called UROC, that can fund you to do research with professors or other nearby scientists.\n\ntl;dr 4/5, fight me MEG!\n\nsorry for the essay",

I can go to the beach a lot and see different beaches and beautiful scenery so close to campus. I got involved with clubs and met some pretty awesome people. Overall it\u2019s been a great experience for me. And the bio program is super interesting too! And there\u2019s a ton of help services including free tutoring for a couple classes you\u2019ll take for science.",

Science isn\u2019t a lot of group work depending on the class. But don\u2019t be shy from it, doing it more will help you get better at it and become more comfortable with it. Working well in a group is a good skill to have.",

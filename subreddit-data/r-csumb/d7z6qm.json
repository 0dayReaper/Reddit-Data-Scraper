As a whole the network/security program is only 3 classes for your concentration CST311(Intro to Computer Networking), 312(Network Security), and CST 412(Network Administration). 412 is really fun and seemed like a semseter long lab to me it was a lot of good stuff. In 312 I learned mostly theory then some unrelated hackery since we finished the class material like halfway through the semester(it was that little). However that was when Pablo Breuer was still here and he was the best according to many in teaching network security",

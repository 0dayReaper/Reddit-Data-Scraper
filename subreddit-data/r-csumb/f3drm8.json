    "postText": "I currently live with two other girls in East Campus. One of my roommates is going abroad for both semesters next year, so we're looking for someone else to be our third roommate (you'd be sharing the double room with me). We're hoping to find someone to form a roommate group with for Reservation Days, rather than leave it up to chance and be placed with a random person.\n\nI'm a CHHS major who will be graduating next year, and my roommate is an art major. We have one quiet, well behaved cat. We're both into anime, video games, and other nerdy stuff. \nIf you think you'd be a good fit please shoot me a message and we can meet up.",

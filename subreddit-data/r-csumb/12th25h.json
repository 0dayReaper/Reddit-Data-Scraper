I had no issues with internships had one with meta and was  able to have a job lined up after graduating obviously full time position. Everyone is experience is different. \n\nThe job market is sketchy but it\u2019s targeted workers with Visa(work visas) , and HR , tech recruiters. Overall if you want a personal connection with professors and your peers then csumb is right for you. The downside there isn\u2019t a Greek life or party culture at this school unless you have friends in sjsu or ucsc to go party there",

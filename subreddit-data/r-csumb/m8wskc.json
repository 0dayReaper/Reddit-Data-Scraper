    "postText": "hello! I\u2019m currently a community college graduate hoping to transfer to CSUMB next spring to concentrate on creative writing and have two minors in English and Chicanx studies. It\u2019s difficult to find anybody with these majors/minors that go here and was wondering if there\u2019s anybody out there who is? also does the campus offer transfer student support? any other tips/advice for transfer students? am I making the right choice to come here? \n\nthanks!",

            "comment": "Hi! I transferred this spring too! I am pretty new and I am minoring in creative writing too. Though I didn't get into any classes cause I am trying to finish my GE but i heard the creative writing classes are good and i believe there is weekly submissions for students to submit their work. For transfer student support there is a whole canvas page for support and the people send weekly or daily updates on what is happening and activities they are planning on doing. My biggest tip for you is while I don't know if we are going back to campus in the fall is to just be on top of everything. Making friends comes naturally so its bound to happen. Also, talk to your professors they can help you immensely if you need help with class. For me a Film major that transferred from Sac State i can tell personally you it is amazing though you have to remember that you make CSUMB what you want it to be. So if you are passionate about Chicanx, English, and Creative Writing put your 100% into it because you are the one paying for your education! Csumb is one of the least expensive schools or at least what my academic advisor told me. People here want to help you if you let them help you.",

I would have to ask him. My experience so far has been really chill. I am taking advantage of every service I can get my hands on. For example, I am a sophomore in a Film major so for my industry I need a lot of experience in the film industry. I talk to the career advisors a lot with looking at internships and then with looking over my resume. Then for classes they have been pretty chill. CSUMB compared to Sac state is pretty small but I feel like i enjoy it more. I will admit that i did drop a course cause the prof seemed to be doing too much and expected too much with it being online. The academic advisors are pretty cool too they help you plan out your classes either by semester or your entire stay so you can graduate in two years. I feel like it would be similar to your CC though csumb has one weird thing called i-learn that is like canvas but not canvas. I wish i can tell you more but i never have been on campus.",

They\u2019re pretty active and hold events for students, some of which are major-oriented. As the staff is now, they are very welcoming, sweet and actually helpful people. \n\nMost departments hold events for their students as well, so I don\u2019t doubt it will be hard for you to find other students with the same areas of study once you\u2019re on campus, especially once you\u2019re enrolled in your non-gen-ed classes. \n\nMy advice? Get involved in clubs and join events. That\u2019s the best way to connect with students outside of class and actually make friends. Keep in mind, many students are also looking for friends. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking to transfer credits that aren\u2019t gen-ed, I\u2019d encourage you to make that a priority when you have appointments with your academic advisor and do it as soon as possible. I didn\u2019t push my advisor enough to check if my courses were transferable. He\u2019d say things like \u201cyeah that sounds like it should transfer\u201d when I asked. So BE ON TOP OF THAT. Otherwise, you might end up postponing your graduation, taking extra classes you don\u2019t need and paying extra money (like I did).",

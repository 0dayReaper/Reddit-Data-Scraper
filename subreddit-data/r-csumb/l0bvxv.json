I want to get into VR software/hardware dev/engineer &amp; hacking away at that as well with this time. I like to draw comics as well. Any other suggestions from you guys?\n\nEdit: I am a transfer student who has completed lower division.",

But she advised me not to apply until I have CST238 and a Speech course requirement. Man, standards are maybe too high if I have been working for 3 years professionally making money doing the very thing that people going through the degree want to do!",

CS Online Academic Advisor here, since the Speech and CST 238 course are required for admission, I definitely recommend waiting to apply until those courses are completed before applying. \n\nUnfortunately, we cannot provide credit for work experience so we cannot use that as an admissions boost. However, you are definitely welcome to apply with the courses in progress, but I always ask everyone to keep in mind that priority will be given to applicants who have all required and recommended courses completed at the time they submit their application.",

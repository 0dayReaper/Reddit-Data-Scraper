If you choose to indulge, please make sure you have a TRUSTED friend with you, stay somewhere away from motor traffic/cliffs/other hazards, and make sure someone knows where you are/where you went. You are not totally yourself when on hard drugs, so plan accordingly. The number one goal should be safety. \n\nAlso, there is no rule against drug content, so I will not remove this post as it is a genuine question that locals/students might be able to answer.",

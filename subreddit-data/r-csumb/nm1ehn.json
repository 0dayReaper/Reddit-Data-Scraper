    "postText": "I got my assignment and it reads as *address*-B Bed 2 and EC FUR Graduate B. I\u2019m assuming EC FUR is East Campus furnished but what does Bed 2 mean and why does it say graduate if I\u2019m only a 3rd year transfer? I only have one roommate listed so far and hers reads as *address*-A Bed 1. Will we be sharing a room?",

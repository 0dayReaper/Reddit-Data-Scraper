OTTER HYPE!!!\n\nOkay, I got that out of my system..\n\nAnyone have any tips on the East campus housing application? I want to get a ground unit. Do not want to live upstairs. Mainly because I'm super anti-carpet. Is there a way to better your chances on getting a specific unit or neighborhood? I've driven around east campus and checked it out and there are already some units I would prefer. Any tips at all would be appreciated. \n\nAlso, how is it setting up your own Wi-Fi with your own router? I've done it before when I was going to UCSC and had no problems but just want to make sure that it will be just as easy at East campus. \n\nAny tips at all would be great. Feel free to DM me even if it is just to connect if you are an incoming student or are already living at East campus or even going to CSUMB. Would love to already have a base of familiar faces when I do go there in the fall!",

Be forewarned that the internet in East Campus is.....really, really bad lmao, especially the upload speed (I get anywhere from 0.2 up to like 2 up on a really good day).",

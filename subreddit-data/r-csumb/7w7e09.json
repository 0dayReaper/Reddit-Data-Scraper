            "comment": "Depends on what your options are. So I can only speak to the Global Studies department, so if you are going into the sciences, then this probably won't be very relevant. I have heard good things about the sciences. \n\nFirst off, and this is something you should look into for all schools, the 4 year graduation rate is a measly 23%. AND THAT IS ACCURATE. Most students take longer than 4 years to graduate. This is mostly down to a horrendous student counseling center which will give students terrible advice. Most people who graduated in 4 years had to take responsibility for it themselves. (I got out in 4 years, but had to take 17 classes my Sr. year [to be fair 3 of them were 1 unit gym classes])\n\nhttps://apps.otterlabs.org/iarapp/files/One-Pagers%20-%20Retention%20&amp;%20Graduation.pdf\n\nSecond, CSUMB is not a party school, but it also isn't a study school. And its also not a sports school. Most colleges will fall into one of those 3 categories, but CSUMB just doesn't. There are no sport teams to follow, the students are not dedicated to their studies and there are no massive parties. Also, what I used to enjoy, partying on the beach, has really been cracked down on. The school kinda has a laid back lazy vibe too it, but that's mainly because there just isn't much to do. \n\nThird, The teachers are a mixed bag. Some were great, but some were horrendously pathetic. The school has this one department, service learning, which I find to be the perfect encapsulation of everything wrong with CSUMB. First off, it is a requirement, you will take 2 service learning classes, which require you to volunteer in the community. Now, while I have nothing against that idea, per say, I would prefer to volunteer in something relevant to my future career. That's not what I got though, I was assigned the UFW union, which was 20 miles away, and I had to drive the hour commute 10 times to get my hours. \n\nMore than that though, you get preached to for 3 hour blocks about incredibly complex topic, that the professors lacks a basic understanding of. I cannot tell you how many, 'corporations are evil' lectures I sat through. Economics is an incredibly interesting field, and it is just glossed over in place for a message about how, 'capitalism is bad.' This is made all the worst because, if you DARE to speak out against a service learning professor, your grade will suffer. (My service learning professor told me that I do not understand the struggles that gay kids go through, I informed him that I am in fact gay, and he told me that, *and this still gets me,* he knew more about being a gay kid than I, because he dressed flamboyantly as a kid. He is married. . . to a woman). \n\nI think that service learning really is a good encapsulation of CSUMB though. Super social justice warrior, but without really knowing what they are talking about or actually caring about the cause.\n\nI will add though, that not all the professors are bad. Kathryn Poethig, Naseem, Professor Wisdom (Karen Wisdom) are all INCREDIBLE. I had several other great professors, but those three really went above and beyond. \n\n\nFinally, I'll end a little more positive. I met people there who are still my best friends after graduation, I studied abroad for a year and had the greatest year of my life, at no additional cost. CSUMB is the cheapest CSU, so I graduated debt free with some help from my parents. I am now in my 1st choice UC grad school, which accepted me with a full ride scholarship. So going to CSUMB worked out for me. But along the way, I watched so many people drop out. \n\nHonest answer, If you got into UCSB or better, go there. If it is between CSUMB and another CSU, CSUMB is fine. \n\n\n\n",

                    "comment": "Definitely depends on the major here, the sciences (Marine and environmental science) are both great majors with tons of field experience and great teachers. And service learning can be tedious but it's supposed to help you build a connection to the community and grow a moral viewpoint on the world, and you should be able to choose the location and topic that it is on.\n\nCSUMB isn't the greatest school, but it is cheap and if your in a science major I think it isn't a terrible option.",

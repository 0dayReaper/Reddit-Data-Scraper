    "postText": "Hi, I was wondering what the requirements for school Id when going to the aquarium are. I'm currently a UCSC student who is looking at visiting with a friend who goes to Monterey bay, but $60 for a day pass is super fucking pricy for my broke ass, so I may photoshop an ID card and keep it in the little clear window in my wallet so they don't get too good of a look at it. I heard students get in for free, so I was wondering, do they scan ur ID to let u in, or do they just look at it as u pass through? or would a picture of the ID work?   \n\n\nor, on the off chance, if anyone would be willing to send me a guest pass or something, that could also work, but I feel bad asking lol  \n\n\nalso idk if this violates the subreddits rules but if it does, feel free to remove the post ig",

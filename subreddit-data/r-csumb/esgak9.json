    "postText": "CSUMB undergrads can study away AFFORDABLY for a quarter or year through the National Student Exchange. Choose from over 160 campuses across the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, or Canada...the most popular destinations are NYC, Hawaii, Alaska, and Florida. NSE is affordable...most students continue to pay CSUMB tuition and only pay for room/board, books, and course fees at their host campus. Some students pay in-state tuition to their host campus, which is sometimes even cheaper than regular tuition. Learn more at NSE.org.\n\nApplications are being accepted now for the 2020/2021 school year. Contact your NSE coordinator for more information: [jcastro@csumb.edu](mailto:jcastro@csumb.edu).",

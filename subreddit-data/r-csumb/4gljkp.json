            "comment": "I graduated from the biology program last year and minored in environmental science. To be honest, I think the ES program has had more time to mature there, so you'll see a lot of field stuff going on around campus, not to mention the masters program they offered.\n\nFrom what I remember a ton of people moved over to Marine Science when it became its own major, so I'm sure they've put a good amount of resources into it since then. The school has its own underwater research program going on and does some work with UCSC. If you're in these majors you'll pass by the office pretty regularly on the first floor of the science center so you can check that out.\n\nJust remember CSUMB is a small school but it works with what it has. I like the weather, but it's not for everyone; and the monterey bay is a big tourist destination, especially in the summer. Many of the Bio/MS/ES students end up interning or volunteering at the aquarium.",

As I got to upper division classes, new ones are being offered that you wouldn't find elsewhere.\n\nWanna go into robotics? Steve is fucking awesome.\n\nDiving? Frank and James got yuh there.\n\nFish? James got yuh.\n\nInter tidal? We have shit for that.\n\nThe professors here are also great for connections later in life. I have connections all over the place when it comes to diving and electronics now because of the friends I've made. Plus the professors are awesome. As are the classes. Tough, but awesome.\n\nOh, I was also an intern at the aquarium and am now a volunteer diver there. I work summers there as well. Easy to get over there as others have said. We also get a free pass every year. I don't use mine cause I get in for free anyways :D\n\n",

The chem faculty are amazing and have helped me get involved in several  research projects. \n\nYou should also check out the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Center (UROC). They help fund student research and will pay for students to travel to conferences.",

    "postText": "I'll be transferring from a community college to csumb this fall and was wondering about the parking situation. \n\nAt my current college it's just horrible, especially the first week, and sometimes you can spend over thirty mins trying to find parking, and end up just having to park in a spot you're not supposed to. \n\nAre there any lots in particular that get overcrowded, or any that always have some spots? I'll only be taking classes in the Gamboard building, so parking near there would be ideal. \n\nI'm commuting from a town nearby and am just trying to get my timing down. Thanks!",

            "comment": "It's not great definitely leave yourself some time and add an extra cushion at the beginning of the semester. I also recommend you scope out the parking spaces the week before and time your walking distances it can be a +10minute walk from some of the lots. Plus the campus has closed off most of the central roads to make it more pedestrian friendly. As one of their green iniatives they are trying to turn csumb into a walking campus, which means not a lot of close parking. ",

Plan in parking in the satellite lots and walking about 15 mins. The good news is the satellite lots are quite large and shouldn\u2019t fill up, but just don\u2019t count on easily going on and off campus during the day.",

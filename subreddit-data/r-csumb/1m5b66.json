    "postText": "Hi all, someone over in /r/montereybay suggested I cross post here. \n\nI'm visiting an old college friend of mine who's recently joined the Air Force and is in Monterey. I wasn't planning on staying the night but decided it probably wasn't a good idea to try and drive back to SF (where I'm actually staying) at 2 am on a Friday night. Unfortunately, the cheapest hotel I can find at this point is like $90. I literally just need a place to crash the night and I'll be out of your hair pretty early Saturday morning.\nPM me if you think you can help out (please include your approximate location and if it would be an extra bed/sofa/room/etc). I'd prefer a female (I'm a girl) if possible but as long as you're not an axe murderer, I think it'll be fine. Thanks!!",

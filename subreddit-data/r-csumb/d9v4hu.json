Not sure who the current professors are at but back then David Reichard was the head of the department. He's the reason I ended up going to law school after working at a law firm for a couple years after undergrad.",

The writing course will help tremendously. I ended up going to the Monterey College of Law due tor the small class size but more importantly the cost of tuition was half of what an ABA school.",

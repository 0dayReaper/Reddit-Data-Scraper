Personally, the two I\u2019m most active in is TPO, which is a theater club, and the anime club, but there are tons of them on campus for whatever you\u2019re interested in. Are you on MyRaft? If so, you should be able to go through all of the clubs on there and see what there is. As to parties, there\u2019s not a whole lot. We aren\u2019t exactly known for our night life. There are some, but they aren\u2019t super common.",

The biggest one I\u2019ve been in was like 50 people and the smallest one I\u2019ve been in was like 8. MyRaft is kinda hard to explain. It\u2019s kinda like a weird social media platform for the school. It has information about clubs and groups, as well as events on campus, but you can also make posts and interact on it like a social media. I would advise staying off the social media portion of it though, for some reason it\u2019s really toxic and weird in a way that isn\u2019t representative of the school culture as a whole. I think you\u2019re supposed to be a student to have access to it, but if you\u2019ve already been accepted then you might be able to make an account already",

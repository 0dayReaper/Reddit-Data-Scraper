    "postText": "I am an incoming freshman looking for a roommate in the residence halls. I tried using the roommate search option in the housing application, but I am confused on how it works. I am 18 years old, male. My interests are camping, cooking, Games (mostly Nintendo, especially Pokemon), books, movies, cartoons, (basically any storytelling media as long as it has good plot and characters), and tabletop game design. I am also interested in Japanese culture and language, and am currently in a Japanese class. Unfortunately, I am terrible at organization, so will probably be very messy. Im not proud of it, but its the truth. if thats a big problem for you then i would not be an ideal roommate for you. If anyone else needs a roommate, or has advice on how to use the roommate search feature, please comment.",

Right now it's best to plan for the worst and hope for the best. My advice is don't put any money down on housing right now if you don't have to.",

The impression I got was that the college suggested for people to sign up for housing as soon as possible.",

But, this year is a completely different situation, and no one really has any answers since the situation is still changing day by day. Just keep watching the news.",

It will make your life and the life of your roommates much more enjoyable. I know it's easier said than done, but don't resign yourself to being disorganized and messy as \"just the way you are\". You can do something about it, and you should to improve your own quality of life and create less friction with those around you.\n\nJust some advice from a formerly messy person.",

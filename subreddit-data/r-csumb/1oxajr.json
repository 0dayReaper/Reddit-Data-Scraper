    "postText": "Curious to find out whether anyone in the area still plays Smash Bros. There's been a big resurgence in popularity for Melee in particular thanks to [this very well-made documentary](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tgWH-qXpv8&amp;noredirect=1) covering the history of the SSB:M professional scene, and I'm hoping to capitalize on that and get a group going here in the Monterey area.\n\nReally just hoping to gauge interest amongst the MB subreddits. If you're at all interested in playing some Smash, comment below. Thanks!",

    "postText": "Hi, so let me preface this with I transferred here in 2016 and am now graduating this May. I am a Communication Design student. Here is my advice and tips for you new/prospective students that I wish I had known when I came to CSUMB.\n\nHOUSING:\nEast Campus (My GF lives here so I am in here fairly often): Cheap, pretty comfortable, RA\u2019s are super lax, but far away from main campus, you will either have to drive, bike, or take the free busses to main campus. You must also buy/rent your own washer/dryer, furniture,  and modem.\n\nPromontory (Lived here for one year): Expensive, most comfortable (if you can get your own room) (cramped if you have to share a room). Everything is new and provided including couches, tables, beds, etc\u2026). There is also a full kitchen in your suite. I recommend being on the higher floors if possible for greater privacy as if you want to have your window open on the first floor everyone will see/hear you. There are big elevators for easy move-in. Also it gets hot in Prom so you will absolutely want your window open the majority of the year.  Good parking but the promontory parking pass won\u2019t work in main campus. Prom is close to main campus (10 minute walk). Moderate RA presence (but on the lax side). Great internet.\n\nDorms (Lived there for one year): Cheap. These are super cramped. You are required to have a meal plan. Cooking is difficult as all you will have to work with really is a microwave, mini-fridge, and the bathroom sink. (no disposal). If you want more then you CAN use the community kitchen downstairs but it is usually gross. RA\u2019s are VERY strict and patrol the dorm hallways looking for loud noise and marijuana smoke smell pretty much every 30 mins. So don\u2019t expect to get away with parties after quiet hours here. Find a friend and throw the party in East Campus if you can.  Great internet.\n\nStrawberry and others: This is the one that I have the least experience with and have only been inside once. It seems like it is pretty much the same as the dorms but with a kitchenette. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t say more but I don\u2019t know a ton about these ones.\n\nOverall I recommend Promontory if you can afford it. If you are a transfer then avoid the basic dorms at all cost (They suck). If you\u2019re a freshman then I\u2019m sorry, but you have no choice.\n\n\nFRATS/SORORITIES:\nThere are some good ones like the Business Frat which can help set you up with some really good connections for once you get into the real world and need a job. Other than that, there are no frat/sorority houses and most members liver separately.  So they are basically just glorified clubs that throw parties at one of the member\u2019s houses. Really not that special here like you would find at other colleges that allow frat houses and such.\n\n\nJOBS:\n\nOn-Campus\nJobs on campus are okay depending on what you get. They pay minimum wage and the food service ones are the worst if you don\u2019t get Peet\u2019s or Starbucks. The people in the OE and DC are always unhappy, but the ones at Peet\u2019s and Starbucks all have a bond together and seem much happier (They only really hire ex-baristas though since less training time).\nOff-Campus:\nThere is a nearby Target that is usually hiring. Other than that Starbucks is always a good option.\n\n\nFOOD OPTIONS\nOn Campus:\nOtter Express (OE): Fast food, they have a knock-off Subway that charges too much, a grill with fried food and burgers (decent), and some \u201cfresh\u201d Sushi rolls (decent but over-priced). OE is open until midnight.\n\nDining Commons (DC): Literally prison food. It is a buffet, most of the food is below-average quality and usually not much variation. They have pizza every day, but the pizza is bottom-tier pizza. Good news is that it\u2019s only $5 (one block on meal plan). Bring a big Tupperware in your backpack and stuff it with extra food for a midnight snack. \n\nHungry Otter Food Truck: Cheap. Like $3.50 for a burrito. Sure the burrito has no flavor, but at least it is filling.  M-F it is in front of the BIT building until 2pm but it usually stops accepting orders 10-15 minutes before 2. This sucks if you have a 12-1:50PM class because by the time you leave and get over there they will not take your order even though it is only 1:50. Sooo, ditch class a few mins early if you want food there. \n\nPeets/Starbucks: They are licensed stores so they don\u2019t really follow normal policy. No gift cards can be used here. Peets charges full price for refills on iced coffee/tea etc. Also Peets charges about $0.50 for a cup with ice (they make you fill the water yourself at the fountain). And Starbucks charges $0.10 for ice water (for the cup, it\u2019s a school policy not a starbucks one).\n\nOff Campus:\nMost food places close around 7PM. There are a few places open past 7, which are Noodle Bar, Pho Lucky, and Papa Chevos (or is it Papa Chanos?). The first two are open until 9 (but they get busy!). Past that, there\u2019s fast food and pizza.\nDelivery:\nDominos Pizza is the only delivery option you have. No, seriously. Uber Eats, Postmates, Grub Hub, Door Dash? None work here. Only Dominos.\n\n\nSHOPPING\nThere is a small shopping center nearby with a Target. This will be where you end up doing the majority of your shopping. There is also a Lucky and a Grocery Outlet pretty close. Safeway and Costco are about 15 minutes away depending on traffic. If you\u2019re into smoking marijuana, Monterey Bay Alternative Medicine (MBAM) is right across the street from the aforementioned Safeway.\n\nCLASSES/PROGRAMS\nI transferred into the Communication Design Major (CD) with all my general education classes done with so my only experience is with this major and cannot speak to others (though I have taken some Computer Science (CS) classes).\nThere are things called \u201cLow Unit Majors\u201d (like CD) which required 3 semesters of language (unlike EVERY OTHER CSU). Everywhere else (or for high-unit majors like CS) 2 semesters in Highschool, which is what I had, would do fine. I took Spanish, the professors are not that great, so good luck if you take that one. Cabrillo College nearby has much better Spanish classes so I recommend taking it there and transferring in the credits if you need it. Some other majors don\u2019t require the 3 semesters of language. \n\nCD classes are okay. Seems to be a lot of self-taught stuff at this school though. You will get several assignments that will be assigned to you and you are expected to do them without being taught how. \u201cdo this assignment, here are the criteria for a good grade\u201d is a lot of what you will get, but not a lot of \u201cthis is how you do this, let me demonstrate a good and bad way to complete this objective\u201d etc. You get the point. Expect to be assigned stuff without being taught how to actually do the thing first. Biggest offender is Jason Henderson (AVOID at all costs). His is really difficult coding and his lack of actually teaching will end you. I am set to pass fine on my first try since I already knew coding before I took his, but a good percentage of those in my current class with him are on their second try. Bobbi Long and Miguel Lara are the best professors with actual teaching and instruction. Seriously, these are the best two teachers you will have in the CD major.\n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to leave them as comments or message me directly. \nHope this helps you guys/gals!\n",

I\u2019ve wanted this for awhile and learning on your own part doesn\u2019t seem that bad considering lot of the tech field is like that. I really do appreciate your tips, funny enough most of the stuff I\u2019ve become familiar with the complaints of the school by looking on Twitter, apparently they have a new food company that people like so hopefully that means better tasting food \ud83d\ude2c.  I\u2019ll def keep your teacher recommendations in mind. How long did it take you to graduate once you transferred? My college only has one articulated class for the major so idk how long it would take me to complete the rest of my bachelors. ",

She is amazing. And basically you need to look at the csumb classes and your cc classes and determine which of your cc classes you think are equillivant to which csumb classes. Then find the course description for each of those from your CC. Then email or print them for your advisor and explain to her why that CC class should count for your CSUMB class. You can do this all over email too if you want. That is how I was able to get all of my classes counted. And they don't have to be exactly the same, they can usually just be similar. And if your CC class has like all but one of the deliverable or topics from a class, you can usually test out of it or just audit the section that your class did not have. ",

I submitted an app to East Campus the second it became available, but my application is still under review. I\u2019m in the \u201ccase by case basis\u201d group so I knew it would be a little longer, but 3 weeks is quite a bit..",

But I would expect them to have less applicants since it\u2019s for the spring semester, so they shouldn\u2019t take as long as they did for me. Hopefully that\u2019s helpful!",

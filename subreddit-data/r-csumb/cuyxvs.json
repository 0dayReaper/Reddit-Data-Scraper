    "postText": "I always hear bad things about the parking situation from other commuters, anyone have any tips or just info on what to expect?\n\nHow bad is parking during the first few weeks of the semester? Is it better during certain times of the day? How early should I arrive to school to make sure I actually find a spot? Are some areas less hectic than others?\n\nThis is my first semester as a transfer student and parking was never an issue for me at community college so I don't know what to expect. I'm taking morning classes so all of my days start between 8 and 10 am. I was hoping picking early classes would make things easier but I just wanna make sure I'm somewhat prepared.",

You may not get super close parking but if you just park in lot 59 (I have never seen it full) you will be fine. \n\nNow you will need to walk just a bit but just listen to a podcast or audiobook or find something else to keep your mind active. Plus walking is good for you it will take 10 mins most places you need to be. \n\nIf you try to get that close spot you will be driving around in circles and wasting time and gas. \n\nOr you can load a bike in your car so you can ride it from the lot to your class. You just got to find what works best for you.",

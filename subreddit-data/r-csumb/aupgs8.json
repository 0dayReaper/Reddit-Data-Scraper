Did you find the classes harder @ MB than in CC? \n\n* Why did you pick this school over other schools?   \n* CSU campuses are known for teaching students the skills required to get by in the workforce, any potential research opportunities?   \n* SJSU is my #1 target for now and I'm afraid that if I don't go to SJSU, I wouldn't be able to get the same advantage in the work force compared to going to SJSU. Does it really matter where you go to get your degree?   \n* Describe the campus life and life surrounding the campus. (Parties, Intramural Sports, etc.)     \n* Any CS majors here?   ",

(I even got a job after graduating just like you). \n\nOnly difference is that I lived on campus.  The strawberry apts are pretty great. The rooms are okay.  I liked it because it was mostly quiet..very fast Ethernet connections..",

I'm also a CS major with SE concentration!\n\n* I picked this school mostly because of cost and location. I was living in Santa Cruz and going to Cabrillo and didn't want to really pick up and move somewhere else. \n* I can't speak to research opportunities because I haven't looked into it yet. \n* I think that where you get your degree can have a noticeable impact, but it's not the only factor. \n* I am living on campus this year and will be living off campus for the next (and my final) year.  I wanted to live on campus to find a good group of friends because making friends at a CC is very different and in my opinion much more difficult. Parties happen, but they are hit or miss and you have to go out of your way to find them most times (knowing people who know people, asking about parties, etc). \n* I am!",

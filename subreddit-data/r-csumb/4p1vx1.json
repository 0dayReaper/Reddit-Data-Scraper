    "postText": "I completed my first semester at CSUMB during the spring as a transfer student and I absolutely do not want to continue in my major(Journalism and media studies) at all. I was looking at other concentrations in HCOM but I either ruled some out and others I question what I can do career-wise. Right now I am trying to figure out another major that I can do and was leaning towards linguistics/spanish. Since I'm not originally from Monterey, I was debating on transferring to SJSU but I do not think they will be accepting spring transfer students. I do not know whether to take a few linguistics classes in the fall or to transfer out altogether to SJSU. ",

They can also guide to which major can help you obtain dreaaaaammm job... Also linguistics is hard its not \"just\" learning a language, so make sure you are passionate about whichever major you decide to pick. Cause without passion you are a robot.\n",

The problem is that I truly don't have a passion for anything. I tolerate some things over others and that's been it for me. ",

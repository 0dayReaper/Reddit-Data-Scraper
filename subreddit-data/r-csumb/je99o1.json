    "postText": "Me and my girlfriend were in the laundry room of our apartment in Schoonover Park last night around 10:30pm  when we heard a weird noise coming from outside. At first we thought it was an animal but then as it came closer we realized it was a person. It sounded like someone was in serious pain, because it was like a groaning noise mixed with weird growling. It kept getting louder and louder so we looked out the window into the fog. \n\nAround the corner came what looked like a woman dresses in a dark black sweater with long curly hair limping and making strange, excruciating groaning noises. Then we heard her say something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m gonna bash your head in\u201d. Needless to say we were spooked. We saw her walking so i headed to another window to get a better view while my girlfriend called the cops, but by then she had somehow disappeared. \n\nWe didn\u2019t hear her at all the rest of the night, the cops patrolled but told us they didn\u2019t find anything. They also posted up outside of our house for a while which was kind of uncomfortable, but whatever given the circumstances. \n\nIt was honestly so weird and it freaked us both out. I\u2019m writing this to see if anyone else who lives in the area saw or heard something similar.",

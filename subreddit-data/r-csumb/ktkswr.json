            "comment": "Hi! I transferred more than a year ago and I can say I love the program here. What I first learned is that the title changes. You will become a SBS major (social and behavioral science) and you will pick a concentration, which I\u2019m thinking you\u2019ll choose sociology because I received my AA in sociology and that\u2019s my concentration. There\u2019s other concentrations but I don\u2019t seem to know them sorry. What I think is a good plan too is to also obtain a minor, but only if it fits with the career you want to be in. My minor is social work because I plan on working with children in juvy so those two tie in perfectly. The teacher I really recommend the most is Dr. Arias. He\u2019s very passionate about what he teaches and makes his classes entertaining! The only con I have and I\u2019m sure all SBS students can agree is our main academic advisor. I\u2019ve heard from multiple peers that she isn\u2019t helpful and is hard to get a hold of. What I heard is best is talk to other SBS peers and get to know who their academic advisors are. I know some are just regular professors. I have yet got into contact with another advisor but I really need to. I hope other people get to give their opinions in this post as well because I\u2019m not that much of an expert but I hope this somewhat helped!!!!",

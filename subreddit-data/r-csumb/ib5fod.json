    "postText": "Hello, incoming transfer. Was wondering when/how the student loans and scholarships get disbursed? Is it like community college where it goes into your account the first day of courses?\n\nEdit: I never got student loans for community college and I only ever got one scholarship, just to clarify. Also would direct deposit be easier?",

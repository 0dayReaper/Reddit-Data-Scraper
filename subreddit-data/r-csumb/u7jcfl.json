I don't know if the pandemic changed that. \n\nLime scooters were also available, and there are plenty of walking paths or bike paths, but watch out for the hills.\n\nBiking is reasonable.",

I usually go to Monterey once a week there's only like 2 big hills that sucked but now that I do it often it's cake. Marina is a lot closer maybe about 10 minutes not rushing on a bike so definitely get a bike. I know the school rents out bikes per semester as well.",

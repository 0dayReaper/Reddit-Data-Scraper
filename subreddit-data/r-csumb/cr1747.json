    "postText": "Hello, my name is Christopher, I am a Senior at CSUMB, and I ran into a bit of a problem. I applied back in May for East Campus housing, but I didn't pay the reservation fee till the beginning of August. I realize in hindsight it clearly says I have to pay up front, but I digress.\n\nAnyway, if in the case they dont put me in East Campus, I am going to need a place to stay in Monterey. I tried calling the East Campus office and leaving my number, but after three days, haven't gotten a call back. I'm from SoCal, I will be driving up to Monterey sometime between the 23rd and 26th.\n\nIf you need one more roommate, and you are close by the college, let me know. I can paying the rent; I'm an accounting major, I'm a car lover, a film connoisseur, I mostly stay in my room working on homework, or I'm at the gym.\n\nUpdate: CSUMB East Housing came through. There was a hold on my account because I didnt pay the fees... but I did. Took a week, and A LOT of phone calls; but now, I will successfully be staying on East Campus!\n\nSay what you want, I applied for East Campus Housing at the beginning if August and still got in. After a lot of headaches, but still!",

    "postText": "Just wondering if there is anyone out there that would like 2 house guests for a few days from the 12th to the 16th of June.. We are two Irish guys in our mid 20s and are attending the US Open in Pebble Beach. \n\nIf there was a couch or some free floor space that was free we promise to be good guests and could come to some agreement over a few bucks! Would be really great if it suited anyone.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from someone.... Or anyone!! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",

            "comment": "So this is the info I know based off the FAFSA Summary we get plus contacting FAFSA and CSUMB FinAid Office: if your EFC (expected family contribution) is 0C, you are eligible for UP TO $6,095 (for the year, mind you). So I contacted CSUMB financial office because I was wondering why I only received $3,097 for the year (based off my initial understanding). They said that since I will be transferring in the Spring/enrolled for Spring, I only received one half of the grant ($6095/2 = $3,097 per semester). \n\nIf you applied for 2019-2020 and you\u2019re enrolled for spring 2020, you\u2019re only getting half of the full year grant you received.\nAlso make sure that you see the breakdown of your full financial aid offer in your award summary. They offer Pell Grant AND Subsidized Direct Loan and you have the option of accepting both or just one. My total aid year for 2019-2020 is $5,847 (Pell Grant-$3,097 and SubLoan-$2,750).\n\nI hope this cleared it up a little bit. I\u2019m basing this off of my own experience and constant calling at the Financial Aid Office plus FAFSA for more clarification \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

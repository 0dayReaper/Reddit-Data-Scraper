    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nStumbled upon CSUMB cinematic arts in my college search and the program sounds incredibly interesting but I can't find any info about the program online.\n\nCan someone who is an alumni or current student tell me about the facilities, equipment, professors, and overall vibe from the program? How much is production and how much is critical studies? And how hard are internships to come by?",

            "comment": "Graduated in 2012:\n\n**Professors:** \n\nLuis Camara, Karen Davis, JP Allen, Chris Carpenter, Dan Janos. (Get these people, they all know what they're talking about and they are interesting)\n\n**Facilities:**\n\nPretty good, lets picture it this way, you will get A LOT of access to equipment and you do many many projects. As opposed to USC or UCLA where you do 2-3 projects per year.\n\n**Equipment:**\n\nThey updated and fix it pretty frequently. Expect to get stuff at this school that you see on sets, don't be afraid to hold and use it. \n\n**Vibe**:\n\nIt's not Los Angeles that's for sure, not as quickly paced and it seems more laid back. Maybe that was just my experience.\n\n**Tips:** Don't film any videos about Fort Ord it's been done 1000x times over, Get to know Luis he's an interesting man, it's not what you do, it's the connections you make. (One thing I regret is not making as many connections there as I should have)\n\nI received an internship (unpaid) about a month after graduating for about three months in a Development place in Century City (Your basic read scripts, do coverage, get coffee deal) Nothing concrete, but it REALLY does depend on who you got to know in the program and how well you did. \n\n**Production and Critical Studies**\n\nGo to the screenings at night for people they invite. They get some pretty interesting Filmmakers out to Monterey. \n\nI would say it's 65% Critical Studies and 35% filming, but once you get to appreciate the background of something filming comes more naturally and starts to progress. \n\n\n",

            "comment": "Hey, current student here! \nThe program has a lot of hands-on classes right now that teach you basic-to-advanced skills in editing, set management, screenplay writing, camera operation, and animation (among others). \nThe general vibe is very connected, since all of us know we need to network to survive in the business. Because of that, teachers will advise you to make good connections, meet everyone you can, and be someone others can rely on. \nAnother great plus about the program is the availability of equipment to experiment with. If you're enrolled in a class that prompts the use of film equipment, you can check out cameras, lights, microphones or anything else you might need, and use it either in-studio or outside. \n\nIf you're interested in studying in a place that has great weather, beautiful and mysterious landscapes, and cool people, then definitely check out csumb. \nHope that helped answer your question!",

            "comment": "I graduated in 2009 back when Cinematic Arts and Technology was Teledramatic Arts and Technology.  However, while a number of things have changed, such as the name; the high levels of technical skill, the helpful and knowledgeable professors and faculty, the hands-on training, and integrated networking are still all core aspects of the program.  \n\nI can second the resources and ability to check out high-end equipment and having knowledgeable people there who will teach you to use it.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't say much about integration of various mediums *radio and theatre* as the department has been trying to phase those out of the curriculum for years now.  Though I had a somewhat unconventional path both at CSUMB and after many of the skills I've learned have had impacts in my professional life even though I am currently not involved in any sort of media production at this time.",

Do you think that because a lot of the students aren't totally into it, the students that are more passionate about it basically get unhindered use of the facilities?\n\n Also, say me and couple of friends wanted to film something over a weekend or two, could we rent some equipment and do that? That's my big thing, like a lot of schools wouldn't let me do that.\n\nAnd are you to the point of transferring or do you like the program enough to stay? I am really between San Francisco State, San Jose, Northridge, Long Beach, and here. But all those other schools are more well known but absolutely massive. Do you have any experience with those programs?",

I personally know MANY people that are in \"the industry\" as professionals that are from this program. And I currently employ one. As far as technical capabilities it's more or less unmatched - better than USC - IF you put the work in to learn from the correct people. The poster above who name dropped the staff and faculty knows what's up. \n\nCsumb essentially has the most underrated film program in the U.S. And the people who graduate and are actually passionate are more technically skilled then their contemporaries from USC. Chris carpenter will probably back that statement up. \n\nThe only thing lacking I would say is real \"leader\" type students who really take charge and understand wtf their doing. So many shit capstones lol. I'd recommend taking the directing class as soon as possible to best prepare you for the highly technically skilled yet creatively lackluster students that go through that program. ",

                    "comment": "I'm also a current student and I find your comments to be a bit disingenuous. I will however agree that there are some students in the program who aren't particularly passionate or capable but you can say that about every major at every university. \n\nOne thing that this major has going for it is that there is a rather large alumni base in LA working in the industry who are pretty welcoming of people who have recently graduated and moved down there. CSUMB Cinematic Arts students are actually pretty well though of in the industry? Why? Because of all of the hands on experience they got while in the major. Alumni and faculty/staff talk to each other...they know who were good professional students and those who were not. \n\nIf you decide to come to CSUMB and become a Cinematic Arts and Technology student or CINE for short (CART is the subject acronyn...it is not the major name...students are a bit dumb that way) and want to get a student job apply for a job at Cinematic Arts. You get your hands on equipment and learn how to edit. The best most successful students were most likely a student assistant in the department. Not all but most...there are good successful ones that were not student assistants but they probably were friends with them. \n\nIn short...the program is there to make of it what you will. Find those serious students, get to know the instructors (some do projects over the summer and have students help out on set), be serious, act like a professional and you'll probably be asked to work on lots of projects, getting more and more experience and have fun.",

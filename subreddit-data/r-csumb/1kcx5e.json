I know a couple people who got kicked out of housing last year because they didn't take precautions.. I used to walk into the forest/disc golf courses to avoid any unwanted attention. It's really peaceful, like someone else said..\n\nIt isn't very hard at all to find some, you'll meet people and find connections pretty quick. ",

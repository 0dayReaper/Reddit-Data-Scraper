    "postText": "According to the eligibility index on the school's website I need an \"850\" to get into the school due to the fact that I'm applying from out of state; I have a 950. What does that mean for me as a future applicant? Does that mean I'm guaranteed admission? Or does it just mean my application won't be instantly denied... I've never seen an eligibility index before.",

The student population has been slowly growing and some majors are harder to get accepted into than others. My major became impacted last year.",

That in a lot of ways neccesitates accepting people with weaker academic backgrounds because the schools they attended simply do not offer the same opportunities. The prevalence (until recently) of remedial math classes etc is an example of this. And those classes are only going away because the CSU chancellor started cracking down on that kind of thing. \n\nYes some majors are become impacted, but the school is still trying to grow. There are a couple new academic buildings being planned, and they are starting to think about hiring more faculty.",

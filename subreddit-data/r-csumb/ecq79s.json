However, you have to remain committed to going to class every morning because it can be a slippery slope if you start missing. \n\nWhen I took my 8am, I struggled about 7 weeks into the semester because I couldn\u2019t get out of bed sometimes. I wouldn\u2019t want take an 8am again personally because I know the same situation will most likely happen.",

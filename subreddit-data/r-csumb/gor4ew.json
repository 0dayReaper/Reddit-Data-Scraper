They wish they got into the fisheries side of things because that\u2019s where the summer jobs are. At the same time if you\u2019re looking for a career outside there\u2019s also the option of Forestry. I know several people in the field currently. I am aware that at the state of California is absolutely struggling to fill these high level forestry positions because all the old foresters are retiring. There are many forestry job opportunities that provide summer housing and set you up for a career right out of college. Good luck!",

I have people who aren\u2019t on reddit that based on their experiences definitely have advice for you or if you have any questions, are interested in learning more about their experiences in forestry or marine bio just ask n I\u2019ll do my best to see what they have to say about it. But from what I see, if you go for the outdoors you\u2019re likely to find yourself a nice career job, especially if you find the summer jobs between semesters. The opportunity to make connections in the working field is hard to find for some majors depending on the college. It\u2019s something I wish I would\u2019ve known sooner!",

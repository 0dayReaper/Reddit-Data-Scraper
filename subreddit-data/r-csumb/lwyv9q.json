    "postText": "Hi, I was recently accepted to CSUMB as an ESTP major and right now it's one of my top two schools. Could anyone tell me what they know about the Environmental Science program there, or anything about CSUMB in general? I love the location of the school and the general friendly/welcoming vibes it gives off but I don't know too much about the overall rigor of the science department or about how helpful CSUMB is with potential internship/job placements. I'm worried about making friends, too, especially since I'm not the most social person and there's a lot of uncertainty regarding roommates and housing for this coming year. Anything helps, thank you so much :)",

            "comment": "I am currently a graduating senior in biology, so I don't know specifically the rigor of the policy side but in terms of the actual biology CSUMB is great, especially when it comes to marine ecosystems and genetics.\n\nIn terms of social life, if you are a more reserved person (liking small groups) CSUMB is a great place, you will likely have the same people in many of the same people in multiple classes (unlike other schools) and generally there is a culture of live and let live (unless someone is being a jerk to someone else). \n\nIn terms of internships I can't say much as I am going into a PhD, but I was able to get many research opportunities through UROC and I am sure there are many internships you can apply for. what I would really recommend for getting internships and career opportunities is making a connection with a professor that you enjoy talking to and working with as soon as possible to mentor you on your career goals. CSUMB is a R2 institution so the professor's goals here are to educate you rather than to do research with education as a secondary aspect.",

            "comment": "CSUMB is a super friendly place. Full of people who are very outdoorsy ( you can enter fort ord trails from campus) and friendly. Mental health and self care is stressed by everyone even science faculty. The UROC program helps students find internships, the scholar program even funds you for it. It\u2019s a great place for environmental studies as everyone really cares about the environment here. You should compare programs, opportunity, and location between your two schools and see which one you\u2019d enjoy/benefit from the most. \nCSUMB is also one of the cheapest CSU\u2019s in state as well. \n\nThe science faculty here to above and beyond. Like it\u2019s crazy how much they have done just in the past year for their students. No other faculty departments have leveled up to how the science faculty do their job and help students. \n\nAlso feel free to email potential professors and CSUMB staff to ask questions, they would be more than happy to help you out.",

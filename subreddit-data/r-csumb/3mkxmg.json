    "postText": "Im from Norway, and considering studying abroad. CSUMB is offering master and bachelor in film and TV and it looks pretty good. Not that expensive, and not that many students (compared to other universities in the US). I was just wondering if anyone has anything to say about the school, the area or anything. Any information at all that might affect me living and studying there. :)",

            "comment": "My experience at the school so far has been extremely positive. I am studying Computer Science so I am mainly exposed to that part of the campus. The faculty are extremely invested in the students succeeding and the students all seem happy to be there. The classes will run about 256 dollars a unit which is about what a CSU will cost. That being said, this is one of the less developed campuses in California since it is only 20 years old.\n\nThe surrounding area is very nice, lots of beaches and things to do. This odes however lead to it being a more expensive place to live. If you wanted to live off campus and have your own place, expect to spend about 1000 a month. If you're fine with roomates than you can probably get away with renting a room. I currently rent a room with my girlfriend for 675 a month so it is actually pretty affordable for us.\n\nThere are a lot of exchange students studying here. It seems that most of them come from Germany however I am sure that there are some from Norway.\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions and I'll try and answer them as best I can. :)",

If you're willing to leave campus there is a lot to do. My favorite thing would have to be the Marina State beach. It's something like 10 miles of warm beach and it is generally pretty empty. If you're looking for something a bit more in town then monterey is the way to go. The two best places in town in my opinion are Cannery Row and Fisherman's wharf which are both set up a lot like a fair except their open all the time. There is also the Monterey Bay aquarium which I hear is spectacular but I haven't been yet. However I do get a free ticket to go for being a student at CSUMB. There are also a lot of parks and golf courses if you're into that.\n\nRecently we have been having a lot of car shows that have drawn a lot of tourists. I also recently attended the Renaissance fair which was about a half hour away. It was massive and a lot of fun but be prepared to spend some money if you're going to something like that.\n\nI haven't attended any concerts in the area however there have been a few festivals. I have not lived on campus but I have heard good things. Just keep in mind that living on campus is always going to be a bit expensive. I would recommend living off campus if you can. The best option for living on campus however would be the east campus apartments which are set up like a regular apartment and are actually a bit larger than what you could get in the surrounding area. The only hard part about that is being allowed to live there. It is my understanding that there is a decent sized wait list. I'm not sure on the exact price however I'm sure that it changes based on the room that you're looking at, they have 6 types available.

Here is a link to more information about the program. https://csumb.edu/cinearts\n\nThe program is very hands on...meaning from the start you are working with equipment and creating content. Not all classes are production, you still have some film history and theory but you have just as many opportunities to create. \n\nWe had four exchange students from Norway in the program last year. They were great and were fun to have in classes as they brought a different perspective and had great feedback on projects. ",

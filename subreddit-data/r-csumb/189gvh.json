    "postText": "I'll be 23 by the time I get to CSUMB, as a community college transfer from Sacramento.\n\nWhat are your guys experiences as a transfer student, while being older than all the other incoming students?\n\nIt'll be my first time away from home, in a new city, knowing nobody. Slightly worried about meeting new people, being older than all the other incoming students (freshmen), and the people my age most likely already having established friend groups.\n\nI'm not too sure where I'll be living, but preferably in something similar to dorms, with a randomly-assigned roommate I assume.",

I feel like I lack common set of shared experiences with those even a few years younger than I. The situation is probably not helped by the fact that I'm not very sociable to begin with. ",

Just don't be loud/a dick after 11PM and you can pretty much do whatever you want. Parking police are a huge pain in the ass though if you don't have a permit (get one).\n\nIf you're worried about meeting people, just make sure to go to the events they have before you start, join clubs, go to the tabling events they have outside the DC and OE.",

Tabling refers to the events in the main quad area by the DC (Dining Commons, generally sit down buffet style...there's tons of different kinds of food) and OE (Otter Express, grab a burger, sandwich and go kinda place, currently being remodeled). Groups and organizations like frats (lol...dont bother in my opinion, but im not a frat type of person) and clubs set up tables with members of their group to try to attract new members. Look into the ones that interest you and say hi!",

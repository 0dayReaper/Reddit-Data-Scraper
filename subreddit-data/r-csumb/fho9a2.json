Pretty odd, but alright. \n\n...\n\n\nI just hope that graduations aren\u2019t cancelled. I\u2019m alright with the Capstone festivals being shut down because I\u2019m not too attached, but I\u2019ve been dreaming of my university graduation for so long. Bruh.",

I really hope we do! :/ I hope that there isn\u2019t a \u201cOh, the semester was only halfway, doesn\u2019t merit a graduation\u201d attitude from the powers that be or a \u201cCancelled, come back for Fall grad\u201d. I would rather just get my diploma mailed to me and not walk than have to wait until next semester or re-do it. Maybe I\u2019m just freaking out or making it a bigger deal than it is, but who knows with all this general, insidious panic. Oof.",

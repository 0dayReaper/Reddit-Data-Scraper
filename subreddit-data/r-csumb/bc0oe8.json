            "comment": "CSUMB is known for being one of the cheapest CSU's, but I understand if it feels like it's expensive because of the amount of financial aid you receive. I live on campus and financial aid pays for my entire tuition, around 3k, and a very small portion of my housing (North Quad suites - I'm currently a second year). If you really wanna pursue this CSU, I suggest looking into the scholarships it offers; it can be pretty substantial. Good luck!",

Both my parents make 50k combined a year I literally I get 8,500 in grant but I\u2019d still be in debt 14-15k my first year. Maybe my financial aid is finalized Lol. Considering not going just because of how expensive it is for a cal state comparing to the value of education you could get there which I assume isn\u2019t the greatest compared to other schools.",

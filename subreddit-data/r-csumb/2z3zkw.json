    "postText": "Dear all\n\nI am a Student from Switzerland and currently applying for an Exchange Semester at CSUMB. I am not sure which housing option I should choose. As I am 24 the International Office told me to take an appartment on the East Campus. Would you agree? I am very interested about meeting new people so I am afraid that it is a harder thing when I live off-Campus. I saw that there are also appartments on-Campus. What would you suggest?\n\nThanks for your answers:-)\n\nBest Regards\n\nJulia",

I wouldn't suggest being on campus, its mostly freshmen and some sophomores and juniors in north quad. ",

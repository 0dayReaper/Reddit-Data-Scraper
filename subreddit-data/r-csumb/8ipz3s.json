Sometimes its the best job on the planet and sometimes its a soul crushing nightmare that makes me wonder why the hell I would get into education to begin with.  This semester is on the soul crushing spectrum so I'll know in a week or two.  Being in the classroom though is generally great, but the campus sometimes makes life really difficult for the teachers with some of its more bizarre policies.",

The thing that is most shocking to me is how little information students have about the world they live in compared to their chosen fandoms (Shit sucks, I get it, but relentless escapism doesn't make things in the real world suck less).\n\nNo one knows how to write academically.

The curriculum felt much more refined, and even newer/adjunct professors genuinely felt like they cared and had actually prepared for the classes.  Sure, there were one or two humanities classes that seemed like they were just bs'ing, but on the whole I thought the classes there were more well done.  \n\nThe other thing I liked a lot more about MPC was the grading.  I sincerely struggled with anthropology and tried hard but still wound up barely getting a C (71 overall).  By my (second to) last semester at CSUMB, I was actively trying to fail a class and wound up with a B+.  While I agree that everyone should have the ability to go to college, not everyone has the ability to pass college.  CSUMB just felt like a diploma factory at times where it was impossible to fail.  I had very poor experiences with my classmates in the GWAR class that just compounded by the time Capstone rolled around.  it's shitty to hear that things haven't gotten better.\n\n&gt;The thing that is most shocking to me is how little information students have about the world they live in compared to their chosen fandoms (Shit sucks, I get it, but relentless escapism doesn't make things in the real world suck less).\n\nI'd love to hear your expand on this a bit.",

My best students are almost universally at MPC not CSUMB.  For adjuncts though the fact that so many seem so committed is always astonishing to me because MPC pays them next to nothing.  It's also harder to prepare for CSUMB in general in the humanities and social sciences because of the interdisciplinary focus of their course.  They hire political scientists, anthropologists, historians, sociologists etc and expect them to effectively teach to some degree all of those disciplines.  I love teaching at MPC but I have to teach at CSUMB to pay bills.\n\nI absolutely agree, passing college should be difficult because it is supposed to represent a degree of mastery of the subjects being studied.  In my mind college has increasingly become high school part two and is taken about as seriously.  Most of my students see it as an inconvenience rather than an place of learning.  I think a lot of faculty don't do a lot to try to dispel that notion either. It certainly doesn't help that pay is generally low and the cost is so high, makes it difficult for people to stay motivated or see the experience as positive for both faculty and students.  So standards drop and it just becomes like you said, a degree factory.  As an educator that's incredibly frustrating especially paired with that tacit pressure to not fail students who might be problematic.\n\nMost of my students who talk about things outside of course content in the class or try to relate content to things they do know seem to have obsessive and pedantic knowledge about fictional worlds, pop culture, sports, etc.  Yet things that they're supposed to know coming out of high school aren't present.  High School sucks sure, but the complete lack of preparation to function in the real world is painful.  The amount of energy devoted to learning about things that don't impact the real world or their lives is scary as hell.  I had a student after class one night spend like forty five minutes trying to explain Fallout to me but they didn't know anything about the basic political structures of the country, the simplest of economics, things that are taught from elementary school on. The most basic of concepts gone, but an almost encyclopedia like knowledge of videogames, anime, and memes. My feeling is that considering that absolute boom in nihilism and suicide memes paired with the escapism of fantasy worlds, sports, and pop culture are making the world we live in worse not better.  I worry that a generation of students that checked out of their ability to improve the real world means that we have to wait for hopefully the next generation to get involved (this isn't a critique of all students, but enough that I've noticed it consistently in all of my classes).  I see it similar to depression, an individual who checks out because they don't feel that they have the capacity to improve their own situation which only deepens the depression, the need for escapism, and the inability to function socially but on a societal rather than a personal level.  It also removes personal accountability, \"shit sucks why should I worry about it\", sort of mentality.  It's depressing and terrifying all at the same time.  Liking those things is rad, but the obsessive level of that like worries me.  This is way more common in dudes as far as I can tell, it probably plays a role in why men are under performing so much in college.",

As a bio major, I think about climate change a lot and understand the escapism, though I try to resist it in class.\n\n Honestly trying to make the most out of uni since it's so gotdamn expensive. You're right though, it does feel like highschool pt. 2 mostly because it's required for some fields. It feels different once you get past GEs. Now I can take classes like specimen prep, field ornithology, and ecology.\n\nI'm curious what you teach, I hope it's not any of the sciences, but I'm sure there are students like that in the sciences as well. My bet is BUS, or PSYCH. No disrespect but these seem to be the \"Hs part 2, idk what I wanna do... I heard X is easy, I'll declare that\" majors",

There's the respect issue which sucks especially when we are doing something I'm particularly passionate about in the classroom.  During lectures and things like that though, I get it.  Most people don't end up at college to really learn or broaden horizons, college is generally seen as a stepping stone towards employment and just another hurdle to jump before adulthood.  Makes me sad but I can't control how other people treat their education.  I can tell them to put the damn things away though.  What's worse that is become a more consistent problem this year than I've ever noticed in the past is students who don't take earbuds out when class starts or try to hide one in during class.  Music is great and all but not only is it disrespectful, listening to things mixed in stereo sounds like horseshit that way.\n\nNo explicit pressure, but most of faculty reviews at CSUMB are based on student evals, students that have the horrible combination of failing and entitlement tend to be the most likely to leave detailed evals.  I've been here for three years and I've never had another faculty member evaluate me in the classroom.  So there is tacit pressure to curve grades upwards to keep evals good.  Good students rarely give evals with the same enthusiasm as bad students.  It really sucks and in my mind my job performance or my employment shouldn't rely solely on the people I'm responsible for failing or passing.",

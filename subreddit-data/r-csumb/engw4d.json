            "comment": "Be well versed in Financial and Managerial Accounting. The Intermediate accounting class has a \"boot camp\" that starts before the official start of the semester. This is because a lot of accounting students come in pretty weak on their fundamentals. Don't plan any late move in dates the semester you take Intermediate 1. At least when I took the program, the amount of people who do all the accounting classes get's pretty small so pay attention to who's in your classes and figure out who is a good worker and student, you'll likely be working with them in the future in the advanced classes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTake your service learning ethics (whatever it's called these days) class in the Spring semester. If you do this, you'll be able to to volunteer for the VITA (Volunteer Income Tax Assistance) program for school credit. VITA is run by the United Way and provides free Income Tax preparation for those under a certain income. This is excellent for many reasons. Your volunteer work will be extra valuable because it pertains to your education and possible future career, you'll learn how to prepare taxes for yourself if you didn't know already, and it's a great experience helping others. If you're bilingual, even better as a lot of the people who come in are Spanish speaking.",

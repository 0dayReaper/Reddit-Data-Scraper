    "postText": "I'm wondering does the school allow you to run ethernet along the walls? I have a desktop that I'd like in my room but I don't have a wireless adapter for it so I would need to run ethernet. I'm not sure about my layout (I'll be in Trenton ct) but is it realistic to run it from the router to the rooms? Where is the wall jack for the modem? Also do you guys just wirelessly connect your TV?",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t know if you can but in my house I have a Powerline which you plug into a outlet near the router run an Ethernet cable to that and then go to your room and plug the second box and run that Ethernet cable to your desktop and you get wired internet. They are some drawbacks but it is better than doing it wireless and having a long Ethernet cable around the room. The internet runs through the electricity so you basically get another powerline and have multiple wired connections around the room. Just make sure to plug it straight to the outlet not a power strip it will mess with the effectiveness. Haven\u2019t had any problems yet and my internet has been stable. \n\nhttps://www.bestbuy.com/site/netgear-powerline-2000-extra-outlet/6203586.p?skuId=6203586\n\nhttps://www.bestbuy.com/site/netgear-powerline-ac1200-gigabit-ethernet-adapter-2-pack-white/4002029.p?skuId=4002029\n\nThese are two options I have the second one and it\u2019s worth it. The top one has an extra port and an extra outlet so if you want your tv to be wired there you go. I have heard that WiFi at east campus is garbage from one of my professors.",

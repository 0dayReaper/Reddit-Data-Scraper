Any solution?s? I\u2019m thinking maybe but a router but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s legal or not.",

Get your own router problem solved. use one of the red ports in your dorm if you have them probably won\u2019t work on the Aruba ap in your room. Depends on what dorm you\u2019re in. Just don\u2019t run a dhcp server on your router unless it\u2019s on its own internal network and you won\u2019t get in trouble",

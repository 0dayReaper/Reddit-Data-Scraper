To go through a real estate agency youd need like a minimum of $60,000 in a bank account, or youd need to be making like $7000 a month from a job, which 95% of college students dont have either. I got denied everywhere because I wasn't making 3x the rent or bc I didn't have 5x the yearly rent already saved.",

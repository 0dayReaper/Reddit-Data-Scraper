    "postText": "I'm a prospective applicant for CSUMB's M.S. Environmental Science program. Although I am aware of their [Careers and Testimonials page](https://csumb.edu/environmentalscience/careers-and-testimonials), and I am interested in hearing about students' and alumni's experience during their time in this program. I am also planning to visit schools of interest and speak to program coordinators and potential advisors. Hoping that posting this will help, should alumni of this program happen to stumble upon this and feel compelled to share their experience.\n\nAdditionally, I am also looking for insight for M.S. Environmental Science programs offered through other CSUs (ex Fullerton, Chico, Cal State LA, etc). I'll appreciate any leads that I can get!",

We also had a furnished place with furniture that the school owned; never got an inspection. Friends never talked about inspections while living in east campus. If they do inspections it's after the semester ends and before the next semester starts when no one is living in the unit.",

Could be that they always came while you were out and you didn\u2019t realize.\n\nIt is hard to believe we are already almost a month into the spring semester and another round of Health &amp; Safety Inspections is upon us! \n\nWhat?! Another round?! Yes...we do Health &amp; Safety Inspections every semester to make sure there are not issues that may have occurred during winter break, with inclement weather, or during the remainder of the semester.  \n\nThis year, even with social distance guidelines, we still need to make sure that everything is functioning properly in your apartment so that you are getting the most out of your experiences and dollars. This year\u2019s inspections will be conducted via Zoom or if you prefer another video conferencing platform, please let the RA scheduling your appointment know. The great news is, just like last semester, you get to choose the time! \n\nYour RA will be in touch soon to set up that meeting with you. This is a great time to not only connect with your RA but also to go over any concerns you have about your unit. Our goal is to make this more of a fun meeting rather than a boring inspection. \n\nThe above are the changes to Health &amp; Safety Inspections for this year. Here is the nitty gritty from our Community Standards:\n\nHealth and Safety Inspections are conducted by Student Housing &amp; Residential Life staff. These inspections are designed to seek out and correct potentially dangerous situations before they cause damage or harm. Student Housing &amp; Residential Life staff will also identify Community Standard violations, as well as maintenance and cleanliness concerns. While it is not the purpose of the inspection to seek out other violations (i.e. alcohol, drugs), if Student Housing &amp; Residential Life staff do come across a violation, they will document the violation and refer the resident(s) for conduct action.\n\nShould any concerns arise during the inspection, your RA may take screenshots during the meeting to report.\n\nKeep an eye out for that email from your RA!",

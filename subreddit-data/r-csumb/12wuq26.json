    "postText": "Please comment any pros or cons of going here. I\u2019d love to hear about ANY of your experiences. \n\nI got admitted as a freshmen, and im having an incredibly hard time choosing between CSUMB or CSULB. Since i\u2019m a marine bio major, MB seems like it would give me a lot of great opportunities, but theres so many clashing pros and cons that are killing me. \n\nI come from a decently big city that\u2019s incredibly convenient. There\u2019s affordable food everywhere, diverse food options, all kinds of grocery stores, malls, you name it. But when I visited Monterey, it felt like a desert\u2026 like there was nothing there. Barely any good restaurant options, any stores or malls within a good distance, etc. Living in monterey and going here just seems so inconvenient. \n\nother con list:\n- 3 people in one bedroom just seems overwhelming \n- the dorms arent the best looking\n- ive heard the cafeteria food is sickening\n- the city seems so inconvenient and dead\n- its far from my home, and i get homesick easily\n\non the other hand, here is my pro list:\n- seemingly good and passionate teachers\n- small campus and small classes, so probably not too competitive academically\n- involved with the mb aquarium so jobs and internships are practically open for me\n- GUARANTEED 2 years of housing\n- tight knit poc community\n\ni would greatly appreciate hearing about your experiences, whether good or bad because theyd help me SO much in making a decision. thank you!!!!",

            "comment": "I graduated last year marine sci. Not sure, is there a marine bio? but I will share my perspective as a 26/M who lived off campus and was very active in the statistics dept and SCI DIVE program. \n\nCampus life is super lacking. Yeah, you cant walk anywhere, you need a car, all activities would probably be on campus and subject to their rules. Dorms are old, campus is sort of ugly. \n\nSounds like you already know the pros and cons. I would say what you have writen is accurate. \n\n went for the academics as was not disappoint. CSUMB is very up and coming and that is double for the MSCI program. A lot of support from profs and staff for internships and such. I found it is very much what you make of it. there is support there but you need to be proactive in reaching for it.",

            "comment": "Sounds like you mostly know what there is to offer, but to clarify a few things:\n\nThere ARE internship opportunities with the aquarium and MBARI, but they are by no means guarenteed. Since COVID, the pickings have been pretty slim but they\u2019re definitley there. You just need to keep a sharp eye out and utilize the career/internship center so you get first dibs. Outside of the aquarium though there are plenty, CAFW to name just one organization that you might have more luck with. \n\n\nNightlife is a definite no but in terms of resturants Id say the selection is pretty wide. Its not anything like SJ or LA, but downtown monterey, and even southern seaside there are plenty of good places to try and in Marina there are a bunch more (assuming you have a car). \n\nId also be VERY careful with the 2 year housing gaurentee but that goes for any CSU or UC. CSUMB hasnt had any issues with it but theyre looking to dramatically increase enrollment and Im not sure how many beds they have before they start needing to make compromises, last thing you want is a housing crisis like UCSC.",

                            "comment": "As long as you keep a good relationship with the professors (which is easy bc the small classes), and show a genuine interest, then Im sure you wont have an issue getting an internship wherever you want. I just wouldnt expect an internship with MBARI right out of the gate. That being said youll have plenty of chances to interact with MBARI staff on a pretty consistent basis. \n\nIn terms of food, I would say the easiest types of food you can get are American, Japanese and Mexican at affordable prices. American theres plenty, I.e Rosines or Lou Lous Griddle in the middle are my top 2. Mexican theres too many to count, Japanese theres a few good places but make sure u do ur research bc there are a few REALLY bad ones. Indian food u cant find and it really sucks, actually had that conversation with a classmate last week, I think there might be one good indian place in the area? But if you have the time on a weekend you can always head up to San Jose and have more options than you know what to do with. Greek, Italian, Indian, Korean, Japanese you name it its all up there. But in the immediate area no indian food. There is a Hawaiin bbq place that ive heard is great though. And obv lots of good seafood around.\n\nEdit: I will say, the primary difference between LB and MB is the size of the campus and population. At both youll get a pretty comprehensive education but I went to CSUMB because its so quiet. In my experience theres a lot more sincerely academically motivated students per capita at CSUMB, and in my opinion its because the quiet attracts a lot of like minded people. LOTS of people here in STEM have plans to do a PhD at some point in the future and the professors love giving advice on advanced education. If that sounds like something that would interest you its another plus. Also MB is transitioning to having a lot of GE\u2019s available online because a lot of people dont want to go to campus for classes that have nothing to do with their major, which I like.",

I am an evolutionary and ecological bio student who was also torn between CSUMB and CSULB. I chose MB because of the small class sizes and the streamlined courses they offer. In other aspects, I wish I would have chose LB. This school is tiny and the opportunities are very limited in terms of internships/research/jobs. My advice is to look at the degree requirements, what classes might be useful to you in the future career wise and consider how important social activities are to you.",

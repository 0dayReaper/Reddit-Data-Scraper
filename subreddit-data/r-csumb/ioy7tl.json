Is there a current and active outdoors group on campus? I really enjoy hiking, backpacking, jogging, surfing, diving, and kayaking so I\u2019d love to try and get with groups to go out. If there isn\u2019t one, or a less active one, I would really like to step up and lead one!",

            "comment": "Yeah I learned last semester the recreation group has a ton of fun stuff. They were doing a biking trip on fridays that allowed you to rent the bike for free. The recreation dept allows you to rent wet suits &amp; surf stuff (If I remember correctly from the meeting I attended ) for reasonable prices. I was going to try to work with them for this ongoing semester to get more experience with recreational stuff. I haven\u2019t really had the opportunity to do that stuff yet in my life and I\u2019m really shy so it sounded like a great thing to do but then covid happened ! We\u2019re also potentially going to have one of those challenge courses where it\u2019s like ninja warrior but not exactlyyy that\u2019s just the only example I have for you. The course thing was going to start during this semester. budget cuts are going to happen because of covid so things will be changing across all CSUs for awhile idk what\u2019s going to hold up and what is not.",

Nice thing with outdoors is it\u2019s usually pretty low cost (as long as you have the applicable gear). I can\u2019t wait to get involved with it once the campus is opened up and I am actually a student!",

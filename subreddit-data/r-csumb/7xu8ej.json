    "postText": "Obligatory to say, this was actually yesterday. \n\nSo me and my friends just found a new game which we were stoked about, having not played any games since arriving here (international students). While we started playing at 20:00 pm, we ended up being pretty loud because of the vast amounts of FUN we had, not realizing that the time was way over the silent hours. \n\n\nSuddenly i hear someone banging on my floor, literally being as confused as one could be i checked the time and realized how loud I was being, and what time it was. I Decided to shut up (not realizing that i actually dodged the RA). Next day i see a Reddit thread about some obnoxious loud cunts in pinnacles disturbing someone's nap-time, realizing how accurate the description was of the events that unfolded yesterday.\n\nSorry to the poor girl under me, will (try) to be more mindful in the future, hehe.\n\nTldr: i was reading a Reddit complaint thread about myself. I also believe i made her buy headphones, which i guess is useful anyway.\n\nbest regards - dorm king",

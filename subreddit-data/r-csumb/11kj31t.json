I'm an environmental science major transferring from a community college. Is there anyone I can talk to about possible options in case I fail?",

Only time I\u2019ve gotten a D or F on my transcript, and on top of that it was a D in calc 3b and an F in chem 1b. I didn\u2019t get rescinded, and Im also an environmental science major btw! I wouldn\u2019t be too worried about it at all, but definitely don\u2019t give up. And it\u2019s not really a secret but CSU\u2019s are being given an enrollment quota for this year, and whichever csu has the lowest enrollment is apparently getting a gargantuan budget cut, so on top of everything else I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine. BUT DON\u2019T GIVE UP!! CSUMB is incredible for upper divs, don\u2019t waste your time fulfilling GE\u2019s",

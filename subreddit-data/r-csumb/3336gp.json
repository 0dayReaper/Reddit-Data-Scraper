    "postText": "csumb vs csu fullerton\nMay 1st is coming up, and I\u2019m kind of torn between these two schools. They\u2019re pretty different- csuf being a large school in Orange County vs CSUMB being a small school in Norcal.\n I\u2019m currently leaning towards CSUMB because of it\u2019s location, small class sizes, and the fact it\u2019s less of a commuter school than CSUF.  I\u2019m hoping that these facts would make it easier to get involved, make friends, and feel more engaged in my classes.\nI\u2019m a bit concerned CSUMB might not offer as much programs/resources as a huge school like Fullerton may have. I also worry that CSUMB may be similar to Fullerton in how many people commute and how easy it is to get involved and do things off campus.\nFor people who\u2019ve gone to CSUMB, can you talk about why you chose the school and the things you enjoy about the school that you might not experience at a larger public university? \n",

            "comment": "I enjoy csumb for the small campus and the location. Coming from the socal area being used to the huge class sizes at my community college I wanted a smaller school. Being a transfer student I don't think I could say how the freshman classes are because upper division classes are always smaller. The school feels close knit though, the faculty is very friendly and helpful. It really feels like a community and you will not get a feel I Ike that at a bigger school. \n\nI can't talk the location you are coming from but myself coming from socal the change to CENTRAL California is spectacular.  I spent my whole life in so-cal and being able to come up to Monterey. Which is regarded as one of the most beautiful areas of California is a chance you don't always get. There is a ton to do outdoors with tons of beaches and hiking trails. \n\nT.L.D.R. Csumb has a great small campus in a beautiful area. It has a close knit campus with spectacular, involved faculty.

            "comment": "Csumb has some weird characteristics and has a much smaller town vibe going for it. Which comes with a lot of caveats: hardly a nightlife or music scene, difficult to get housing outside of campus (rich people live everywhere, prices are high). That being said there is plenty of upsides: great faculty, lots of community stuff. Some nifty outdoors stuff (scuba dive kayak or hike or backpack or ... within miles of each other) it's really an international location to...: concourse d'elegance, pro tours, Laguna seca, aquarium, close to SC and SF. Lots of pros, but it's a difficult area for young people, especially if you're not exactly well off/ have financial help from parents. Hard to get established. Also if you like abandoned buildings it's pretty neat to check those out. Hmm, honestly it should probably depend on what you're planning on doing for school stuff. Like csumb film/video arts program is on par with many of the top notch schools in SoCal. The global studies is also a really neat program, pretty amazing historical and radical foundations. If you're trying to be a teacher though you might be disappointed. Feel free to PM if you want. ",

You would need to purchase a washer and dryer with an electric hookup. It is very important to note which type of prong you will need as we cannot guarantee that your unit will have a 3-prong hookup available. Please note that due to liability issues our Maintenance Technicians would not be able to service the washer and dryer in any way as these would be your personal property, which includes installing the washer and dryer in your laundry room.",

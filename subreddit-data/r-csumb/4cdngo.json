    "postText": "Has anyone here decided to not choose a room on their housing selection day? My day to choose a room on East Campus is tomorrow, but since I really don't want to live there, I'm thinking of not choosing a room so that I can possibly select somewhere on the Main Campus on April 21st. This of course means that I will be picking a room after everyone else has chosen one. Does anyone know how likely it will be that I wind up with a place to live? Is there typically a decent amount of open rooms, or will I likely be without a dorm?",

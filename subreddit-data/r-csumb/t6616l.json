            "comment": "Congratulations on getting into the 2 universities!! I am a recent transfer student myself, I just transferred from a community college to CSUMB for psychology in December and this is my 1st semester. The professors at CSUMB are very polite, make sure you learn the info correctly, and are the best at teaching the concepts for the classes. The only downside is the service-learning requirement (CSUMB is the only university in Cali to make students take a service-learning course in order to graduate) lmk if you have any other questions.",

Some classes have community service that has to be done outside of it, or during the class itself ( i.e a final project). \n\nI\u2019m a junior transfer and i\u2019m in east campus. I haven\u2019t had much luck meeting people beyond class and clubs are kinda a let down with some meeting only on zoom. There are a few parties here and there but most are kickbacks or greek life affiliated. \n\nMost people I\u2019ve come across mostly mention their plans with their roommates over people they met externally, but i\u2019m hoping things start  up for me soon. I hope this helps!!",

Campus life-wise, parties are pretty scarce, maybe a few here a there, there isn't much to do on campus since not many people are around but there are ALOT of areas in Monterey, Seaside, Carmel to explore and see nature. The campus is kinda far apart but not bad enough to need a bike to get across campus (it's your choice if you want to). If you enjoy being in nature and exploring, it's best to have a car since all the good food places are off-campus.",

Most of the professors are great. Advisors are just ok. I personally don\u2019t think the social life on campus is great. It\u2019s just nice because we are close to the Bay Area and Santa Cruz and we have Carmel.",

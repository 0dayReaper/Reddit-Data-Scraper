I truly believe the program starts you off amazingly. You start with a production class showing you the ropes of film where essentially learn film history, learn lighting audio and editing, make two short films and talk about films. Not only that the professors are helpful all have film industry experience! One of them got an award from Sundance for her documentary. Is Csumb as big as UCLA, USC, CSULB, or north ridge. NO it\u2019s not but we have passionate people giving their best to the program. You will get useful info and experience if you to try. I\u2019m on my second semester and I got my first internship. No one will give you handouts in film so you must go for it. There\u2019s a lot of people who are passionate and make short films outside of school. Some make music videos others skits. The film program is extremely good but small. Yet I have learned a lot",

A good number of the students who graduated and went on to have successful careers in the industry worked as student assistants for the department as either check-out and studio staff or in the editing suites providing assistance.",

            "comment": "It's a good program if you put the effort into it. It's very hands on with a lot of production classes but also with being crew on class projects and senior capstones. Pick an area that interests you, like being a gaffer, or sound (boom operator, mixer or post production sound), production assistant, script supervisor, etc and find someone to assist until you are proficient. Reputation is key in this field, the more people know that they can reply on you the chance you'll be asked to be on a lot of projects. Sound is sorely needed as everyone wants the \"sexy\" jobs like cinematographer, director or editor and sound is almost always the area that makes decent projects kind of crappy because it wasn't the priority. Find me a really good movie with bad sound. You can get away with shaky cams but you can't get away with crappy sound and you can rarely fix it in post. Case in point...the Sound Design class being offered this semester only has 10 people enrolled. That is sad.",

I took a sound design class at sac state but that was when the pandemic hit and I didn't learn shit from that class cause the teacher stopped trying and just told us to read the textbook and write essays. I just rather take in person bro so I can have hands on experience on sound opposed to just reading so a full understanding of sound. I hope they put up the class again bro cause I need that class more than any other thing. I am conflicted I want to drop my creative class just to take that class but i don't know.",

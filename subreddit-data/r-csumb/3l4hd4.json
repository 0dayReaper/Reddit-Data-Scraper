I visited the campus but it wasn't open and will be visiting on a tour this friday. I was also wondering if it was possible to switch from communication to linguistics?",

Here is a link to the courses you will take, if you will pursue a B.A. in HCOM:\n\nhttps://csumb.edu/catalog/human-communication-ba\n\nHere is a link to the courses involving Linguistics, however I don't think we have a Linguistics Major program.  I believe it is housed under the Liberal Studies program, designed for future teachers:\n\nhttps://csumb.edu/catalog/linguistics-courses\n\nI really love the HCOM program here, but that's because of the humanities integration into the program.  Make sure it's what you're interested in!",

A few kinks are still getting worked out this semester since a new building was just built for the CSIT program however all of the staff and my peers are incredibly nice and knowledgeable. Overall I a happy with my choice in campus however it is still my first semester here. I transferred from northern California and the climate is about the same.",

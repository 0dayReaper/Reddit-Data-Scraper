I eventually want to go to grad school to become an academic advisor/counselor but in case that doesn\u2019t happen what can I expect as far as job prospects go? Has anyone done internships with this major? Thanks!",

            "comment": "I'm going into my senior year as a CHHS major (I transferred). There are 3 concentrations: social work, community health, and public administration (you can also pick two of them and do a combined concentration). \n\nThe vast majority of CHHS students are in the social work concentration; I'm a community health concentration. CHHS requires a 3 semester long consecutive internship in order to graduate. I'm currently interning with the Monterey County Health Department. It's a demanding program and you'll work hard, but a pretty high percentage of CHHS kids graduate with a job offer/employment. The professors are great. Feel free to message me if you have more questions :)",

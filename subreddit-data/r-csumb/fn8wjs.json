    "postText": "Hello guys! I have a question. How exactly do the roommate groups on the housing application work? Does that mean I can pick a group of roommates to room with me? If I don\u2019t do it, does it just choose randomly? I do want to be part of the roommate search process, so maybe? Idk how it works, and the CSUMB website doesn\u2019t help much. Thanks in advance!\n\nEdit: if it helps, I\u2019m transferring in for Fall 2020.",

Not even so much as a confirmation email saying my application had been received. I really want to get an unfurnished single in east campus and I feel like the longer I go with no response the less my chances are of actually getting the placement I want.",

For roommate groups, there should be a step in MyHousing that allowed you to choose roommates.  You can also call the main housing office about it, if you're worried about the roommate selection process.  If you do end up getting placed randomly, housing will do it's best to match up roommates with similarities, but it isn't a guarantee. \n\nI don't know if this helped, but let me know?",

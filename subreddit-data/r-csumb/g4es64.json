I\u2019m pretty shy but, everyone I\u2019ve met that\u2019s been here since freshman year has a solid and adorable friend group. However, if you struggle to meet the right people or fulfill social aspects of your life please just attend one of the group meetings at the personal growth &amp; counseling center it\u2019s really nice to just talk about random stuff with people and a bonus is that there\u2019s a licensed professional there to help with any serious stuff that comes up occasionally",

If the parties available don\u2019t match what you want in a party, dont be shy to host them. I\u2019ve hosted a few parties ranging from 10-70 people. All of which have been a lot of fun, you just have to do some prep prior, but nothing crazy.",

Everyone likes to get high and sauced. Surfing isn't too bad, also gym is dope.",

You have to meet the right people or test your luck and follow the noise and try to walk in. It really is a taboo subject in the area though. Cops shut them down constantly. It's not like other schools where they promote partying. It feels like an underground thing.",

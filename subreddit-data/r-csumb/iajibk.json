When I started the program I was at one job and moved to a higher paying job but I\u2019m still at the same job since graduating and don\u2019t have plans to leave. \nb) I might not be the best to answer this since I had already been working in the field but honestly they do a very good job. You obviously need to put in a little more time to dig and maybe get more of a real world implementation but you learn all the necessities for being able to land a role as a developer. \nc) I went into Georgia Techs online masters program. \nd) putting in time and effort and actually learning the concepts instead of trying to only pass the assignment or test. \n\nThis program was truly amazing. The counselors/student helpers are amazing and super helpful. They help you come up with a full plan and you are automatically registered into the classes you will be taking. They answer all questions promptly. It has been a wake up call as to how easily navigated the program was compared to Georgia tech which is obviously because this is a masters program and there are a lot more students. \n\nVery good experience.",

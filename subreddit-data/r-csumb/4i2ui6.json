Promontory is pretty nice with a new full kitchen and free washer/dryer, but it has its problems. East Campus is a older and you have to pay for the washer/dryer, but it is basically sharing a whole house. ",

East campus is a little older, it's reconditioned military housing. It's pretty nice and fairly quiet. East campus is far more 420 friendly if that matters to you. ",

Honestly, I cannot imagine two people living in any promontory room I've been in. I'm going to Strawberry instead of Promontory because I refuse to live in a double there and that was the only option when it was my selection time. ",

Promontory is one of the nicer complexes and it's also the most expensive one but if you can afford it, then definitely consider it. As for east campus, it's definitely one of the cheapest places to live on campus. I share a bedroom so my monthly rent is $525. You also have a kitchen, bathroom, wash room, garage, and living room. As for the situation with laundry, there is a laundromat you can use but my roommates and I rent a washer/dryer for $40 bucks a month and split the cost between the 3 of us. It's always extremely quiet and relaxing which can be rather boring at times but if you make friends with people in your classes or your neighbors, it does make it fun. ",

From there on I went to my apartment and that was pretty much it. Well I never really brought people over but people stay overnight, then you're technically supposed to let the RA's know but most people don't do that because they never check up on you at all. As long as it is okay with your roommates then you're good to go. However, if someone stays overnight and they have a car then they will need a permit so that they don't get fined cuz the cops and campus police patrol every few hours or so. If nobody uses the garage then you could just have your guest park in there so you can hide the car but idk if anyone has done that. ",

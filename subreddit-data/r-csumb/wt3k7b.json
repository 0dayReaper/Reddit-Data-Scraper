    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI currently attend sac state and have a projected date of graduation for spring 2023 but there\u2019s once class that\u2019s holding me back. I am trying to go into the military through OTS and they require a bachelors degree within a year to apply to their program. I wanted to know if CSUMB is a good school to get a bachelors in computer science? Is a degree from this school like one of those degrees that everyone just gets or is it completely different? I heard CSUMB is nationally accredited and to stay away from schools like this, is this true? Any advice is helpful, thank you!",

            "comment": "Just graduated from CSUMB with a computer science degree. By far the biggest downfall is that internships are not part of the curriculum and there is basically zero help in getting one by extra-curricular means. The capstone projects (which I gather are meant to be in lieu of an internship) are also extremely hit or miss. Mine was horrible garbage. So if that is the same or worse at sac state or if you can live without an internship on your resume I\u2019d say CSUMB isn\u2019t a bad option. Aside from that aspect the professors are great people and very very knowledgeable and willing to teach you more outside of class if you\u2019re willing to ask. Also I might be biased but it\u2019s hard not to say that CS is the best program at this school. Don\u2019t listen to the business majors when they say otherwise.",

Are you trying to figure out if a course here will be easier than at Sac State? I feel like you don\u2019t really have time to transfer here if you need to be done in spring 2023. You can google CSUMB\u2019s accreditation status and read about it yourself.",

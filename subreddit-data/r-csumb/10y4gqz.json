    "postText": "They\u2019re letting students and faculty down. The campus is going to keep growing. Far as I can tell they\u2019re going to remain combative and in denial. Our campus is so pedagogically progressive and committed to students, why doesn\u2019t parking services seem to give a fuck about students or faculty? Is it just the result of being a subset of policing? When so many students are commuters and have other jobs that schedule right up against their class time, we can\u2019t have finding a parking space that isn\u2019t a 20 minute walk from class be a crapshoot and a 20 minute process in itself.",

            "comment": "I attended CSUMB from 2004-2011. Every year they removed a parking lot to put up a new building of one kind or another while simultaneously jacking the price of parking passes through the roof. They also put up barricades in a ton of areas where you used to be able to drive through, in order to make it more of a walk/bike campus. The problem is like you said, you have to park a mile away from your classroom or dorm, which makes getting around campus a complete pain in the ass, especially when you have to walk a mile uphill after parking to get where you need to be. I used to bring my skateboard with me when I lived off campus knowing it was going to take forever to get to class with how far away I'm parking. I'm glad it's something I'll never have to deal with again.",

The best plan is to find a lot that always has space to avoid wasting time searching at multiple Iots. Then, factor in the walking/shuttle time - I find that lot 59 always has spots and it's about a 7-minute walk to rhe library. The shuttles are also now running like clockwork, if you time it right.",

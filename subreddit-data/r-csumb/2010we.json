    "postText": "I'm a senior in highshool interested in the computer science with a focus on game development degree. The main reason I want to go to this school is for the degree since it's the only school I got into that has it because I haven't heard back for UCSC yet. I would rather go go SFSU because I would prefer a bigger school and like city but they don't have the degree I want. A regular computer science degree is my second choice and I can get that at any CSU school. If any one is in this program is the degree worth getting or should I just get a regular computer science degree at my preferred school?",

            "comment": "I'm currently a CSUMB CS student, going to be a senior next year. I've taken a ton of the CS classes, including the game development concentration course. The main thing you should know about CSUMB is that it's a fairly new CSU, with the game development concentration being even newer, probably around 4ish years old. I will say the classes are great and the majority of CSUMB professors are extremely nice and will help you succeed as best they can. The last part is one of the biggest advantages to a small school like CSUMB, you get to know the professors very well.\n\nMy personal advice: it really depends on how determined you are. If you have the passion, like some of my friends, you will easily excel in your courses and leave CSUMB with an amazing portfolio to show any game studio. However, if you are just looking for a degree name so you will be ahead of the average person CSUMB is probably not for you. Also if you have any other questions I would be more then happy to answer them.\n\nNow that I've type all this I realize you have made a choice by now lol. ",

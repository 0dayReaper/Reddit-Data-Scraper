    "postText": "Is anyone else having difficulty logging into the HBO Max through CSUMB? I keep trying to login with the provider, and every time I click Cal State Monterey Bay, it takes me to a blank page with no login info, no place to put in an email or password, just a white blank page that says \u201caffiliate not enabled.\u201d What am I doing wrong? I\u2019m trying to do this on the HBO Max app on most recently updated iOS. I\u2019m trying to do this for the first time, and I feel like an idiot. I even contacted customer support to no avail. Many thanks to anyone with advice!",

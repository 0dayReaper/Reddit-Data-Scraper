    "postText": "Hello, I'm a current EC resident and won't be graduating until May 2022. I'm in a family housing unit and with summer right around the corner and no plans for summer housing announced yet, what should I expect? Do I need to continue attending classes during the summer to keep my unit? I know I'd get housing for next Fall but moving out would be an ridiculous only to move back in in a couple months.",

You only need to be a resident at time of applying + have a fall reservation + family unit\n\nI'll fit all those 3. Nowhere did I see that you had to be a student during summer. Which I technically could be but wouldn't want to take on that tuition.",

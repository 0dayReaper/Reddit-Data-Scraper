    "postText": "Hello friends! I plan on transferring to CSUMB in Fall 2023. I am currently trying to get an idea of what people that live off campus pay for rent. I would love to hear how many roommates you have as well as where you live. I am not set on a particular location and I have explored Watsonville, Seaside and Monterey as possible locations. Thank you!",

            "comment": "i feel like i go on a pedestal about this too much but you really can't beat East Campus in terms of housing at CSUMB, for what it's worth. It's much cheaper than living in the Monterey/Seaside area. it's not a very walkable area but im assuming since youre already planning to live off campus you have a car. if you're dead set on not living in East Campus, expect to pay $700+ just for a room in a house - the greater monterey area is only getting more and more expensive, sadly",

I moved to EC last January and the rent raised $300 since I've been here (I do not get rate lock because they exclude grad students for some reason). A double is also $791, mind as well get a room somewhere else for $700 and not have to share a room like you're 10. EC is only worth it if you get the 2 bedroom family unit for $1719",

The upcoming fall cost of a single is $1000+ the last I checked but it does include utilities which is nice! Off campus is pretty similar if not more expensive.",

There's definitely some cheaper options out there tho but you'll be lucky to get a 1 bedroom or studio for less than 1800 these days around here.\n\nMy advice, like a lot of other people, is to stay in east campus during your time at CSUMB.",

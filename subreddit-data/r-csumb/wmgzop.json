Now I received an email with the books I need for classes and I'm quite shocked because they are so expensive...\n\nAre there any possibilities to get them for a cheaper price? For example something like a flea market? :)\n\nAny advice would be really appreciated. Thank you :)",

It still might not be the cheapest option, but it\u2019s much cheaper than buying them new from the school bookstore. You can also sometimes get pdf digital copies of the textbooks, and those would also usually be cheaper than physical books to buy or rent. You can also usually find used copies to buy",

Before you buy anything, check to see if these books are available on course reserve or (even better) available online through the library. If you can\u2019t find them there, you can try Abe Books or Thrift Books. Both websites sell used textbooks in varying levels of condition. I have been happy with all my purchases through them. And as a last resort, you can always try Amazon who, through their monopolizing practices, can offer the lowest prices on new editions. Best of luck!!",

If I interview 2 equal candidates and I notice 1 went to a UC v a CS, I will definitely give that UC alum an extra point .",

City size, business prevalence, teacher connections to industry, these all matter. CSUMB is a fantastic school and is rich with opportunity, but I would be doing you a disservice saying that it\u2019s better all other things being equal.\n\nEdit: that being said, all things are not equal. Cost, proximity to family, connections to the valley, these things matter as well. Without full context it\u2019s really hard to give a firm piece of advice. I have a number of friends from each that can give you a better feeling about each program. Feel free to DM me if you want me to pass you their emails.",

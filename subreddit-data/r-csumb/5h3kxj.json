    "postText": "Suicide Prevention Service of the Central Coast is currently recruiting new volunteers for our Suicide Crisis Hotline. \n\nFor over 45 years Suicide Prevention Service has been serving Monterey, Santa Cruz, and Benito County residents through our services, which include a 24-hour suicide crisis hotline. In that time our hotline volunteers have responded to countless individuals who are suicidal, in crisis, grieving, or concerned about the well-being of a loved one. More than anything, people with thoughts of suicide need a safe place to express their thoughts and feelings and be heard. Through our training, prospective volunteers learn the skills necessary to help support and establish safety for all of our callers. \n\nBy reducing stigma, isolation, silence, and dispelling the myths that surround suicide, we can all make a difference in our community.\n\nFor more information on our Winter Session (beginning January 26th, 2017) or our Spring Session (beginning April 11th), please contact us by calling our administrative line (831) 459-9371 x2, emailing us to sps24hr@gmail.com, or visiting our website at www.suicidepreventionservice.org \n\nPlease help us inform our community members about this rewarding volunteer opportunity by posting or forwarding this information to your colleagues, business partners, gatekeepers, and loved ones. \n\nIf you are having thoughts of suicide, are in crisis, or are concerned for a loved one, please call our 24-hour suicide crisis hotline at 1(877)-663-5433\n\n\nFlyer: http://i.imgur.com/rWoCG9k.jpg\n",

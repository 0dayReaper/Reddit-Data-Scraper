The professors are dedicated and  while the program is still evolving into its rigor, it strikes a nice balance between learning fundamentals and preparing for the actual work of a software developer or project manager. For a small, young, cheap (relative, school is too expensive in USA) state school, I'm making good money with a good job and have many former classmates in the same boat. CS is challenging but there is a dedicated faculty there. They also had a prescient focus on the _ethics_ of software development.",

Compared to my non-CS friends I definitely have more job flexibility (work from home of wherever, though COVID has made that a bit more universal).",

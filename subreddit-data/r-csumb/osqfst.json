I might be wrong since I did not do undergrad here but I think there is not a specific journalism program, there\u2019s a film/media major and there is what they call \u201cHCOM\u201d which might be what you are looking for. https://csumb.edu/hcom/\nAgain, I could be wrong.\n\nETA there is also a human communication major which is slightly different from the humanities &amp; comm I mentioned above. https://csumb.edu/hcom/human-communication-ba/ But probably you\u2019ve already seen those and are just looking for more specifics.",

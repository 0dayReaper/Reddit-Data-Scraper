    "postText": "Hello! If you are a current csumb student who is interested in genetics, genomics, or data science, you should sign up for bioinformatics this spring! It will be a lot of fun, and an opportunity to collaborate with researchers in Colombia on a novel genome assembly! \nThis is a great course for anyone interested in grad school, or interested in careers in biotech or public health. \nI hope you will join us!

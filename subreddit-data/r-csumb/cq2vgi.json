    "postText": "If you are going to be living in East Campus you should pay rent with your credit card to get the easy points. Just make sure you pay it off at the end of the month to avoid interest and late payments.\n\nEast Campus doesn't charge an extra credit card fee so you might as well look into it if you are going to be responsible with paying everything off.",

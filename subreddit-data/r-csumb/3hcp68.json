I called to see if there was a problem with my account in the middle of last week, and they said it would be back online today and I wasn't the only person calling about it. Are there any other applicants out there having the same problem as me still or should I call again? I'm terrified I'm going to miss a due date for something and I don't even know what the dates are without the damn list.",

The only thing that is on the checklist at this moment is turning in an official transcript which doesn't need to be turned in until October 15th but I suggest doing that sooner cuz I found right away that I was accepted since I turned everything in really early.",

    "postText": "Hi guys! I was wondering if anyone has heard about anything involving CSUMB dispersing more cares act grants. There was another bill passed at the end of December providing more money to schools. Places like CSU LA and UCSB are supposedly dispersing these new funds to students soon. But there\u2019s not even any information on the CSUMB website about HEERF II. Does anyone know any information on this? The financial aid office was not very helpful when I emailed asking about it.\n\nEdit: There has been an update in one of the office hours with Ochoa, and they are now going to start contacting students on March 8th and hopefully dispersing funds by March 11th.",

I don\u2019t recall seeing the HEERF acronym. The email sounded like they\u2019re not sending anything from the mentioned funds until the fall semester. Also, I guess I have deleted the email so i can\u2019t go back and review what I saw sorry Im not super helpful but I know I saw something explaining funds that were over a six digit number",

I think we are all getting screwed here. We have people getting evicted from student housing and people with disabilities getting trampled on. It's not right especially from our university and it's our money, not theirs. Damm greedy administration.",

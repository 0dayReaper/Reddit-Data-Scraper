How are they handling classes during COVID?  Is everything still virtual?  Do expect a better sense of normalcy next year or like this year continued?  Anything else you wish you knew before you went there?",

            "comment": "Living on campus is a great experience. I enjoyed it a lot compared to obviously this past school year. Yes you can pay for a single dorm, freshman can have cars on campus, right now everything is virtual. Just recently got an email regarding the August 2021 semester, they said there was uncertainty but that planning for in person teaching has begun. Something I wish I knew is to enjoy it all, even the shitty parts of it because from going to College and living on my own to back with parents and not having the same freedoms sucks.\n\nEdit: Hope this answer helps, if you have any more questions feel free to start a discussion.",

The science professors at this college are just so amazing. They spend time talking about mental health and self care, and are really helpful to students when we are struggling. And you usually won\u2019t see many science faculty care at all about mental health, so it\u2019s nice that they do. There is a free tutoring service as well for most classes.\n\nI don\u2019t think you should make your choice based on if the college is having virtual or in person classes. Look into the faculty and programs and see what suits you best. Colleges who are staying virtual are following guidelines to keep their students and faculty safe. And most likely classes will return to in person in the Fall after the vaccine is distributed.",

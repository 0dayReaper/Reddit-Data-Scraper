    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm planning on applying to the CS Online program to start in Spring 2024 and had some questions on what the community college equivalents are for CST 231: Problem Solving/Programming and CST 238: Introduction to Data Structures. \n\nI was looking at DeAnza's classes and am having a hard timing figuring out which courses would be equivalent. I'm not limited to DeAnza any CC should be fine. \n\nCan anyone help me identify equivalent courses? Also is it possible to do both courses at the same time? I think I only have enough time for 1 DeAnza quarter worth of classes if I want to apply during the fall. \n\nThanks!",

I've tried using that site but it seems to only show a list of classes that can transfer to CSU MB not necessarily if they're equivalent to the specific required courses. TBH I might just not being using it right",

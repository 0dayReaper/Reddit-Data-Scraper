It's much cheaper than living right on the CSUMB campus and cheaper than living in the Monterey/Seaside area. It's not a very walkable area but your Otter ID card gets you around on the MST busses for free and you can take the bus to tons of places in the surrounding areas. If you're dead set on not living in East Campus tho I do recommend Homeless Otters - I just personally found Homeless Otters to be a little more focused on young professionals/alumni looking for housing than current CSUMB students",

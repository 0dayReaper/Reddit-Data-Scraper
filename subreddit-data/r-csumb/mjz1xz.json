    "postText": "So I was accepted for fall 2021 (humanities communication major). I\u2019m really lucky to have the option of moving in an apartment or student housing so I\u2019d love to hear your opinions on it. I have a dog (6 y/o mini schnauzer) that is super well behaved and lazy and it\u2019s really important to me that she can stay with me. I hear the east campus allows pets. If so, how much would one typically pay in rent and what kinds of restrictions do you have as far as having people over?",

You can do FANG for a while just be aware that you work a shit ton of hours at these companies and you burn out quick. If you want to stay in town, there\u2019s quite bit of work at DLI and the other military base that I always forget the name of. \n\nAlso, FANG is: fb, apple, Netflix and google. \nDon\u2019t work at Facebook. That\u2019s all.",

My knowledge is the normal starting salary is in the 50k-60k range depending on what contractor hires you and what position you actually get. You can get more money going to a tech company in silicone valley but will probably be trading pay for job security.",

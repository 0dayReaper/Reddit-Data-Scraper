We are aware that a hindrance to making a difference within our community and gaining new skills and experiences is financial restrictions. We definitely want there to be less (and hopefully no) barriers to volunteering, and that may not always be the case. \nAlthough volunteers offer their time and compassion, we hope that in return, we can offer our dependable, good-natured volunteers a strong community and hotline support at all hours. Our hotline is here for the community 24/7, and our staff is on-call for volunteers 24/7. In addition, after one year of service with us, we show our gratitude by helping out with references and letters of recommendation. We are more than willing to speak wonderfully on behalf of our volunteers and support them in whatever direction they choose. This work isn't for everyone, that that's okay! And if it is, then that's okay too! \n\nIf you have any concerns about our hotline, response, or other areas, feel free to send us feedback via our anonymous feedback form on our website. \n\nThank you!",

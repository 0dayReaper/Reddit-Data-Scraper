    "postText": "I'm a junior without a car (and it will most likely be that way next year too) that's most likely going to go to East Campus next year. I actually prefer Main Campus housing but I'm worried I will not get a room since Juniors and Seniors don't get priority for Main Campus, so East Campus it is. \n\nSo, I was just wondering, what's East Campus like? Do you like it? Do you prefer main campus housing? Any amount of details and information is appreciated.",

I don't have a car either so I rely on the bus for everything which isn't too bad but it sucks after a while. I love the housing here though. The apartments are pretty nice and the neighborhoods are always quiet but it can get pretty boring here. If I had to choose, I would choose to go on main campus just so I can stay close to everything, not have to worry about my safety getting home at night, and not have to get up so early to be involved in school activities. We do get a fridge, sink, stove, laundry room, garage, two bedrooms, living room so it's roomy. ",

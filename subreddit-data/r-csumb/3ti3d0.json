    "postText": "I wanted to give you, the students of my former college, the first chance at this free stuff.  If it's not gone by Saturday, I'll post to Craigslist, but you wouldn't make me do that, would you?\n\n[This week's free stuff (with pictures!):](http://imgur.com/a/WuwKa)\n\n-A foosball table, which is still in pretty good shape.  I don't have the actual ball, and it's missing one cup holder, but everything else is there and working.  This foosball table started life out on Antietam, and I figure it's only fitting it ends up back in the hands of an Otter.\n\n-A non-working 55\" Samsung DLP TV.  Does 1080 and all that when it works, but there was a problem with it that I wasn't able to figure out.  If you're an electronics genius who can sleuth out why it's not working, you've got yourself a free TV!  No other real problems with it, and the casing's in good shape.\n\nThe only catch with this stuff is that I don't have a way to get it to you (this is why it's free).  If you can come get it, it's all yours!\n\n**Please make sure to message me to set up a time to pick it up.**",

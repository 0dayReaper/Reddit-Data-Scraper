    "postText": "Hey everyone, so I'm not searching for myself but my girlfriend. She'll be moving up to Monterey Bay in just one week and transferring to CSUMB. She has school covered by loans and grants but we found out that she didn't get the pell grant... So now she won't be able to afford rent after November unless she gets a job that can fit around her schedule. She has class 8am-8pm on Mon/Weds and other wise is pretty free the rest of the week. Her area of strengths are in childcare and teaching, She's been doing it for years. Does anyone know what's available on campus, or near the school/area? As of now, she'll barely have enough money to eat and put gas in her car. Thank you all in advance.",

The one stop center in seaside and salinas are great, but maybe the best is the goodwill workforce assistance center next to the goodwill on north main in salinas. They have lists of local temp agencies, post local job listings and help with resume writing and applications",

There are plenty of events that come up throughout the year in pebble beach that use students.\n\nAlso: have her check in with the department head / assistant to, and see if the front desk has any availabilities. I was able to get classwork done and access to all the professors, with minimal interruptions, while being paid by the state. ",

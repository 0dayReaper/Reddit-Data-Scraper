But what I can tell you is that csumb is still a young and small school, you can have a lasting impact. \n\nYes it sucks that the night and party life isn't as great as in southern california or the bay area but for the most part you just have to be smart about partying in the dorms.   \n\nBefore you know it your time here will also be up.

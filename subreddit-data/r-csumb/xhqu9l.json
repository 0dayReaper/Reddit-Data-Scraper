We live off campus and we've already been to most of the big-name breweries but were curious about what the recommended student bars are. Thanks in advance!",

Chibo\u2019s is gross tbh and whenever I was there it was like a zoo with people constantly fighting and getting kicked out. So it was The Brit, which does have really fun karaoke nights, and Crown and Anchor which was always good vibes. Those were really our go to\u2019s. Sometimes the hookah lounge by Peter B\u2019s but its kind of eh.",

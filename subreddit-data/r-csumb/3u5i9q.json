First of only read this if you are interested in software engineering because that is really the only concentration worth doing at CSUMB. That being said the CS program there is a lot like life, you get what you put in. If you want to give little effort you can get by and get the degree but will probably end up with just a piece of paper and a hope for a job. However you put some effort and many of the staff will work with you and you can go far. I know quite a few of my friends got jobs within a few months ranging from 35k at random tech places to 110k at Uber. Or if you are planning to go to grad school I know the UROC program can be great and I know a someone who ended up getting a full ride to Carnegie Mellon. ",

I transferred in for Network &amp; Security and they only offer one security class which is a joke since my junior college offered 4 different security classes. It might get better though because the security teacher this semester is a 1337 hacker (pretty much) and all his students love the class. They gave us a survey about his style and we all gave rave reviews. He was asked to come back next year and said he has some plans for the program.",

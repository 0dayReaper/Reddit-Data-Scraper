    "postText": "I got recent notice that I was accepted as a transfer and I have been trying to get a sense of what CSUMB offers and how the Communication Design program is. I specifically am looking at the Web Design concentration as I would hopefully like to work in UI/UX field one day. So for those of you who are in CD, how is it? Do you feel it has prepared you for the field of your choice?",

            "comment": "I'm conflicted as to if I can say it prepared me for my actual current position since I do a lot of marketing and working with clients now. I did the web design focus and did not take a lot of the primary UX/UI/HCI classes. \n\nI'll say that if you're looking at doing specifically web design there are a LOT of coding languages that employers are looking for that CSUMB did not have in the curriculum. I was specifically taught HTML, CSS, JQUERY, SQL, JAVASCRIPT, PHP.\n\nWhile you do need those, many employers want web developers with experience in python, angular, .net, ruby on rails, perl as well as what csumb taught.\n\nI'm personally in the camp that expecting devs to be proficient in like 15 languages is kind of ridiculous as the field seems to have gone in a direction where to be competitive you have to know a bunch of different languages rather than be specialized in just 1-3. \n\nFor your goals though of UX/UI, you're mainly going to be working in illustrator and programs like sketch. I've heard good things about the UI/UX programs from CSUMB from other students. Though at the same time, the one person I know who specialized in ui/ux has been unable to find a good job in that field since we'll before the pandemic.\n\nNow for the really bad thing where I was totally mislead by the CD director. During my visit to csumb we were all told that we would have a final \"capstone\" project to show off everything we learned at csumb. We were told that they invited 50+ employers to the capstone presentation and many of the CD students got hired right there at the capstone presentation by these employers. We were also told that something like 98% of all CD graduates have in-field job offers within 2 weeks of graduation.\n\nEverything I was told in the last paragraph sold me on the program. And NONE of it was true. We all worked for TWO SEMESTERS on our capstone projects. Know how many employers showed up? NONE. Not a single one. Apparently they \"had a new girl in the office who didn't contact any\" or some BS like that. \n\nAnd yes, the capstone project makes a good portfolio piece, but we were told to expect job offers at the presentation if we did good. Didn't happen. Definitely felt jipped. \n\n\nAlso, here's a housing tip if you do go to CSUMB. If you can afford it, I HIGHLY recommend living in Promontory if you can afford it. By far the best housing on campus. Also, apply early and do not apply for the dorms at all. I applied for dorms, promontory, and east campus when I applied. Dorms was my backup. Well, when they did housing, I was put as #1 on the wait list for east campus but because there was an open spot in the dorms they took me off the wait list and stuck me in a double dorm. Which SUCKED as an adult and transfer student. 0/10 adult dorm experience. So skip those so you can actually be in the wait list for the better housing options.",

                            "comment": "I went in as a transfer student from a community college where I got an AA in web design. I am unsure if those were potentially taught in Year 1-2 class. All of my CC classes transferred fine to CSUMB however, without any of my classes having React or Bootstrap, or even Wordpress. I personally followed the path of taking the required classes to get the degree. So all I can say is that they are taught in the core required classes. It is possible however that they have other classes dedicated to those topics, but no councilor or program head suggested them to me at all. CD head did say the course was specifically revamped based on what the majority of employers were wanting in applicants so the core classes would set us up for success, so I didn't think I needed to go outside the core classes either. \n\nJust checked the CD curriculum, I don't see any classes, including electives, that have bootstrap or react mentioned. https://catalog.csumb.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=2&amp;poid=252 \n\nFeel free to explore their site in more detail than I did and see if they have one, but I sure don't see it.\n\nThere ARE a lot of free self-guided courses online to learn some of the other languages though, which I'd recommend doing while you're IN college before you are trying to get a job rather than try to learn after when you're in job more rather than learning mode. (not that learning ever stops in this field).",

            "comment": "I'd highly recommend using the concentration as a way to figure out if you're heart is truly in web design vs web development. Initially I went in design &amp; UI/UX centric but you'll end up having to take courses alongside the CS students, I ended up falling in love with being able to build a system from the ground up &amp; knowing how to fine tune my design on top of it afterwards. \n\nIt didn't take long after graduating to find a position as a Jr developer with free reign of design decisions for internal projects, and now holding a position as a Sr Web Engineer. Though I do wish I could have taken more challenging programing courses, the major and those in charged did open my eyes to what the possibilities were.",

I got accepted into the Collaborative Health &amp; Human Services) &amp; Human Services program, but am interested in Public Health, or maybe Community Health Education. (not sure what I want to pursue yet, but maybe thinking Public Policy)? I\u2019m wondering if anyone in either area has insight what it was/what it\u2019s like for them? thank you in advance!",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a CHHS major! It\u2019s a great and really unique program full of transfer students. Most of the classes are in the evenings to accommodate the majority of single moms in the class. The coolest part of the program is the internship part of it. They require you get an internship and guide you through the entire process. This is because they understand that this major is mostly soft skills that need a work environment to grow. It results in many people having jobs in their field when they graduate. It\u2019s intimidating but it\u2019s a super unique program and the pros definitely outweigh the nervousness, and they really hold your hand the whole time and walk you through it",

I think it\u2019s so great about what you mentioned about internships, &amp; how helpful they are. that is so good to know! thank you again!",

                            "comment": "Because this major is quite broad, it\u2019s a lot of introductory courses which I personally find more fun. So intro to social work, intro to public health, intro to public admin and nonprofit management, and maybe more I don\u2019t know. There are some others that are focused either on research and educating ourselves on related topics or building skills like leadership skills. I had one class that was basically how to run a meeting which was a cool set up and I really enjoyed it.\nI\u2019m personally not really sure what I want to do yet because it\u2019s so vast. My concentration is in social work, but I don\u2019t know which aspect yet. Im considering criminal justice as well as mental health services. I haven\u2019t started my internship yet but im excited for that to give me some more clarity and direction. I know lots of people who are interested in school social work or generally wants to do stuff with case management. Im not as sure about what people in the other concentrations are trying to do. Again it\u2019s vast and appeals to a lot of things. Once you figure out what you want, it\u2019s easy to base your research papers and stuff like that on what you\u2019re interested in. Or be like me and do a lot of things and hope one sticks eventually",

            "comment": "i graduated from the community health/public health concentration of CHHS in may 2021. i feel like my experience was drastically neutered as i was a fall '19 transfer student and hence i only got like 1.5 semesters on campus before we moved home because of covid and then i never ended up back at campus before graduating. \n\nchhs is intense. the foreign language graduation requirement for all csumb students is waived for chhs majors because of how intensive the classes can be. i was a transfer student with like all of my gen eds done, and i had to take 5 classes per semester every semester in order to graduate on time, and one semester i actually took 6 classes. the internship is 3 consecutive semesters, you can't start and stop like midway. \n\nit's a somewhat small major (like 500 kids total) and it's dominated by social work concentration people, so you get especially close knit with other students, especially the ones that end up in your capstone cohort, and you'll see a lot of the same people in your classes (especially if you're in the smaller concentrations/not social work). i really liked this aspect of it. \n\ni took such a huge variety of classes. you have to take intro courses in every concentration (community/public health, social work, public administration) which made me  feel quite well-rounded. also grant writing, statistics, etc. i will say, because of the rigorous courseload for chhs, i literally never took non-chhs classes. i didn't have time in my schedule to. i wish i couldve explored some other tangentially related majors a bit. \n\ni really really liked probably a solid 75% of my professors. a lot of them you may end up having multiple classes with, and they will push you. adrienne saxton is one of the most genuine and compassionate people i have ever met in academia (she teaches some classes and is also a massive part of the internship/field work program for chhs). \n\nwith all that being said, i didn't end up getting a job in my major. i am not local to monterey and didn't try to get a job in the greater area, and hence, i felt like all the connections i made at my internship (which was  really not a wide network at all mostly because i had to do 90% of the internship remotely) were relatively meaningless. they are adding an MPH program soon that ive been passively eyeballing",

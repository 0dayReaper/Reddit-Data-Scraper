If I could choose, I would choose to live on main campus(so promontory, north quad, strawberry) just because I did not bring a car and I would like to be walking distance from the school, activities, etc. However, east campus is the cheapest place to live. I pay 525 a month so it's only 2500 for one semester. They are apartment style housing so you have two bedrooms, living room, bathroom, kitchen, a washroom, and a garage. If you get to live on the second floor then you have a balcony, if not then you have a small backyard. If you have anymore questions, you can pm me and I will be happy to answer them. :)",

Coming from SLO as a transfer student and am curious as to if East Campus appts are decent to live at for a student who plans on driving/biking to campus.",

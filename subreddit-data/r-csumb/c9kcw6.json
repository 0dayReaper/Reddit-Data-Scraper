    "postText": "Hi, I'm going to be a senior in high school this August, I've been doing a lot of research on colleges (mainly Cal States because my requirements fit them better) and Monterey Bay has caught my eye, specifically the communication design major, with a concentration in game design. But I haven't seen much about it, other than all the course and class descriptions on the official website. Is there any insight you guys can give me about it? Like is it enjoyable or worth it? Thanks!",

                            "comment": "They moved the goalposts for graduation requirements for us a couple of times. At one point they removed units from a mandatory class that then required us to take an additional class on top of the mandatory capstone advisement class, which was worthless because the main teacher for the program is woefully useless. There aren't enough teachers in the major so you take the same class with the same professor again and again, while learning no new skills in the actual software because she doesn't know how to use any of it. She continually enlisted help from students to effectively teach the classes, and each class only had about 2 projects a semester, so you re-iterated the same project again and again until you hated it, regardless of whether it got any better. \n\nThey also don't teach you anything about licensing, which is an important aspect of graphic design.\n\nThere is also a programming requirement, and the only teacher who taught the javascript class was such a terrible teacher he got taken off of teaching the class. So that must have gotten better now that he's no longer teaching it, but it was a rough experience.\n\nProbably other things I'm missing, but it was just a disorganized mess. I regret taking the major. It was relatively easy, save for the programming stuff made artificially difficult by inattentive and hands-off teaching, but I wanted to kill myself while I was trudging through the same garbage material again and again from the specifically incompetent main teacher. There is one other graphic design teacher who teaches a couple of specific classes who had a more enjoyable personality, but gave equally poor instruction in my opinion, and assigned a lot of useless busywork that was ultimately unproductive.\n\nThis might all sound super salty from me, and it is, I hated attending the school. But you should know that I'm not one of those kids that's pissy because I didn't pass and didn't get my way. I graduated from the program with \"distinction\" or some such honors somehow (lol). \n\nFinally, I don't know of any of my peers that graduated who got a job in the industry. My girlfriend who was basically the opposite of me and was very passionate about the program but had the same complaints about its format has yet to find a relevant job and she was one of the better people in our class. One guy works at a retail store. I was friends with a handful of others and my gf keeps in contact with them as well and I'm not aware of anyone that got a good job in design. (That's not to say they haven't, I'm just not aware of it. But based on my small circle I'd say the graduates are far from thriving.) I was fortunate to find a good technical job that uses skills I learned outside of school, so the coursework was entirely irrelevant to my current career field, my degree just got me in the door at my company. But if you actually want to do something with this kind of degree, I'd strongly advise you consider another school, or do a major that this school seems to excel at like marine bio or kinesiology or something.",

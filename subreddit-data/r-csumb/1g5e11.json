    "postText": "Niantic Labs (A Google Startup) has a beta game called Ingress set up.  I don't want to lose you on the details so here is a link http://www.nianticproject.com/ It's an Augmented Reality game where your GPS takes you to landmarks where you battle others.  There is even a chat log for cheese talking.\n\nI'm here to see about recruiting a few people who enjoy sight seeing and looking at their Android phones for long periods of time to my faction (Enlightened).  The enemy faction is  Resistance and due to the cool nature of Resisting they have 3 times the number of players as us.  If you are interested I can answer questions here and if you are serious I can procure an invite (Due to the demand for invites I gotta make sure you are a local).\n\nThere are currently two players at CSUMB.  UCSC has like 20.  You guys are lagging.",

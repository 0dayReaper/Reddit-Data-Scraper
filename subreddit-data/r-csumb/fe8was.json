    "postText": "Hi! I am a Network/Security major transferring Fall 2021 (fingers crossed)\nI will technically be transferring as a junior and I already got a little information on the East housing. \nMy question is, how hard is it for someone to get housing with an 80lb dog. She\u2019s very well trained and more shy than anything. \nI\u2019m 30 years old (female), homebody that wants nothing more than just to chill at home with my dog and play video games/watch anime/ snack. \n\nAny recs or advice as far as what I\u2019m working with here?",

The best professor for the network security course left a few years ago and it\u2019s gone downhill since. He worked for navy cyber command was a total G and a hella good teacher. \n\nI\u2019ve heard since the new professor is eh. There\u2019s only 3 classes that are network/security related. Cst311 is a joke, 312 is subpar now, 412 with Marcelo is amazing but it\u2019s just a systems administration class basically. You\u2019re gonna take more programming classes than network/security just so you\u2019re informed",

Get yourself a home lab and learn Linux, routing,switching, firewalls etc you\u2019ll be surprised what you can do without schooling. Just a thought because of how predatory and rip off universities are these days pay for promise of a good job that isn\u2019t necessarily the case. Just my 2 cents",

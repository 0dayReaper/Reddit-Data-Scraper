    "postText": "Hey everybody i'm a 21 year old Junior potentially transferring to CSUMB in the spring time. I'm going to throw a lot of random questions towards you guys! Hopefully your opinions about the campus will reflect my decision positively! How is this campus? Are there fun activities to do around the area besides the downtown and beach? I heard the campus is really small and outdated is this true? Are there ever house parties around the area? Is it easy to get into classes or is everything impacted like other CSUs? Can I ride my bike to the beach? \n\n**If you currently go or went to the campus, what are things you really like and things you really don't like?**\n\n",

            "comment": "CSUMB is a good school; it was a great match for me academically because it is small, very involved in the field I am interested in, and located in a place where a lot of work can be done in the field. If you like hiking, diving, fishing, surfing, outdoorsy stuff, Monterey Bay is generally a fantastic area. BUT.\n\nDowntown sucks. It is very expensive and there is not a lot going on. If you are from anywhere warm, you will be cold all the time. The coastline is beautiful, but you won't be swimming without a wetsuit and you certainly won't be sunbathing. Campus is fairly isolated and you have to leave campus if you don't want to pay out the ass for food. There is nothing going on. When you do go out on the town, the only other people out are retired. There is not a lot going on for young adults unless you have an outdoorsy niche as mentioned before.\n\nI can't speak for East Campus; I've heard that cost of living there is pretty reasonable, but I've never lived there. However, if you live off campus, good luck finding an affordable place.\n\nThe campus is alright, I'm sure there are better campuses and worse ones. Since it is built out of part of Fort Ord, you do see some old abandoned buildings strewn about, but its kinda interesting to see.\n\nAs a transfer student you shouldn't have too much trouble getting into the classes you need. If you are in science, PM me and I may be able to give you a few more details that should be helpful.",

You will need to have some form of transportation, so that you could visit some places outside of campus. \n\nI graduated a couple years ago, and I work in an office with many other young people, we all went to different schools, and when we share war stories, It seems like I had more fun and created more substantial connections with the staff and other students. The class sizes are generally much smaller than other schools, and the teachers make themselves available. I was able to approach past professors, or professor whose classes I never attended and ask for their advice. I graduated from the school of business and I always enjoyed the talks I had with the department chair. She really helped me find what I wanted out of school, and how to attain it. My coworkers went to more prestigious schools, but did not receive the same level of education. ",

You are paying for it (tuition) so might as well use it.\n\n2. Beautiful scenery. Go to Big Sur, PG, sand dunes and everything in between. Get outside even if you don't normally like to. People retire here for a reason, its effin amazing.\n\n3. Connections. Be active and get yourself out there. Join a club, get a part time job, volunteer or intern. It'll look great on the resume and will make your experience that much more better. College is also about making connections that will carry you throughout your life. Make good friend choices. I played disc golf twice a week with different groups, a fun way to burn some steam.\n\n4. Still \"close to home\". Invite your family out for a saturday tourist day. I did this often and we did some kinda stupid shit but it was still fun. Whale watching, aquarium, hiking, or wait for a Carmel art festival.\n\nLong story short, you will find what you are looking for if you look for it. Don't expect it to land on your lap. I chose CSUMB because of the environment around it and in my opinion chose correctly. \n\nBTW, we are in Concord now with cousins that graduated from Cal High 3 years ago. Small world.",

The floors and walls are incredibly thin in those apartments and you can't live alone there anymore. The parties are often busted within and hour or so of starting up now, too. :/ But for the price, they are good. The internet does suck though.\n\nThe beach is within biking distance, but not much else is. The bus is free for students, but it takes about 1.5 hours to get to downtown. The best place (in my opinion) to drink is Post No Bills. It is a great craft beer bar in Sand City. If you like the dive bar scene, Britannia Arms (The Brit) and Mucky Duck in downtown Monterey are pretty okay. I haven't been to any of the \"clubs\" but I heard that they are all overpriced and horribly stuck up.\n\nThere is an awesome liquor store in Marina called Roger Food and Liquor (I think...). It has a great selection of beer and spirits. The owner is super nice and accommodating, too! Seriously, he will try to order anything you want. \n\nDo you have any friends already on campus or in the area?",

The sheer number of trails is nice for exploring/riding around, there seems to always be more trails to ride as you venture further out. There are also multiple public entrances around the area so you can easily ride the trails that are normally too far away.\n\nThe only downside is that the entrance closest to campus is a couple of paved miles away from the public land. There are closed trails on private land right at the entrance, but they appear to be patrolled from time to time. ",

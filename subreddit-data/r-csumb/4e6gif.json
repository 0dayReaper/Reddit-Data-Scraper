I'm not sure how much the plans have changed since I had a meal plan (3 or 4 years ago), but I remember there was only a 50 or 100 difference between meal plans with more/less blocks.  I got the one with the most blocks because it was way less per block.  Not really worth it buying a plan with a lot of flex.  Obviously don't use blocks outside of the DC.  That is what flex/cash is for.   When I lived on campus, most days I would eat lunch and dinner at the DC, then bring home food and save it for breakfast or midnight snacks.  It's always good to go out and socialize for dinner!  Many a fond memory at the DC.  The weekend omelette bar saved me from countless hangovers ( they had real eggs if you asked for them).  ",

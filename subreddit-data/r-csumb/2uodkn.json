The teachers are fantastic, as well as most of the student body in my experience.\n\nSports...not so much. I hear good things from the players, but in general sports takes backburner priority for the campus in general.\n\nMonterey is fun to visit, not necessarily to stay. I don't want that to turn you away from the school, but after a year or so here, there's not gonna be much to do unless you're an outdoors kind of person.",

It's nice going up to a professor and he knows you by name. \n\nAs far as getting around. There are a lot of buses that take you to the major places you would like to go. Having a car is very much preferable, but the buses aren't bad.",

It has a decent strip of bars in downtown monterey. If you don't like the crazy club seen but like going out at night down town monterey is perfect for you. The campus also has its own disc golf course which makes for cheap entertainment.\n\nCons: Its isolated like havegooda said. \n\nIt would be easier to answer whether you would enjoy CSUMB if you gave us an idea of what you enjoy doing and what your general vibe is.",

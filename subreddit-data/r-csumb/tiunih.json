            "comment": "The marine science program makes an emphasis to really get you hands on experience in the field. A lot of my classes have had multiple field trips just to get out in the actual environments. If you are more interested in going out to the field, then this CSUMB is a great opportunity. If you are more focused on lab research, it is a bit lacking from my perspective. Unless you go out of your way to take physiology and/or anatomy, there will not be an overwhelming amount of opportunity for lab studies. Keep in mind, this may just be due to the online nature caused by the pandemic, but that has been my experience for the past few years.\n\nOther than that, I would be willing to bet that you would be hard pressed to find as many professors who truly WANT you to succeed. Not only scholastically, but professionally. Many professors make it clear that they want to help you get internships, jobs, and the likes. One of my professors actually planned out an entire class period to help explain more real life financial things that simply do not get taught to us (wages and expenses of marine scientists, realities of being a marine scientist, investments, etc.). Since the campus is new(er), classes are still relatively small. While you will have big lecture hall classes, most of your classes will be 20-30 people where you can easily get to know some other people, but also get to know your professors.\n\nI would also like to add that the Monterey bay area has so many opportunities for marine scientists. There are so many dive shops to get dive certified (some where you get student discounts), there is the aquarium to get firsthand experience seeing all the creatures you learn about (and a free day pass through school), there are many professors that offer paid research opportunities. \n\nAs someone who transferred to CSUMB during the pandemic, I might not have the best firsthand experience. That being said, feel free to ask any other questions that come up.",

    "postText": "Hey Otters!\n\nI\u2019m [Hannah Getahun](https://muckrack.com/hannah-getahun), a contributor with [Voices of Monterey Bay](https://voicesofmontereybay.org/), and I\u2019m working on a story regarding in-person classes at CSUMB for the Fall \u201821 semester.\n\nStudents, faculty, and staff: What are your thoughts regarding the pivot from online to partial in-person instruction during the pandemic? Is in-person instruction helpful to you? Are you concerned about COVID cases on campus?\n\nAre you immunocompromised and have to go on campus? If you can\u2019t go on campus, is it affecting you in any way?\n\nIf you have thoughts on any (or all) of these questions, PM me or reply to this post if you want to contribute! Let me know if you would be interested in a short interview as well.\n\nAll the best,\n\nHG \n\nTwitter: @ hannahgetahun",

My in person classes are higher level comouter science classes so we only have 12-15 people in class as it is. The in person combined with zoom lectures are great, because if I don't feel like showing up one day, I can just tune in over zoom. The hybrid format seems like it just gives people a good excuse to be lazy to be honest. Except for the few students who aren't local to Monterey, most of the people using zoom are just people who don't feel like coming to class. I highly doubt most of them are actually concerned about covid at this point, especially due to the schools vaccine mandate.",

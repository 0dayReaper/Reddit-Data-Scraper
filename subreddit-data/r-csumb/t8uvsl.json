    "postText": "Is anyone else finding it difficult to make friends? I transferred this semester and have only made one or two. The clubs mostly meet over zoom and the others have one or two events with established groups already. I talk to people in class and some friendships have started there, but they rarely make it a over a classmate connection since they already have friends outside and don\u2019t seem too interested in taking it further. A lot of people I\u2019ve met say they just hangout with their roommate\u2019s, and since I don\u2019t have one this has also been discouraging. \n\nI\u2019m outgoing and love to talk to new people, but I don\u2019t feel comfortable seeing a group of 3-4 strangers and joining their conversation since I\u2019m (usually) the person arriving and leaving alone. \n\nPeople who have friends\u2026 how? Are they your roommates? Did you join a club? Are you a transfer? \n\nThis isn\u2019t a pity party invite, i\u2019m just wondering if anyone else feels the same and would want to be friends. I\u2019m a junior transfer in HCOM and 420 friendly is a major plus.",

You learn a really neat hobby, you learn from some of the best in the field, and the people that go through the classes with you are awesome. You will have fun, damnit.\n\nAlso the DSO, Drew, is awesome. I should text him sometime before November.",

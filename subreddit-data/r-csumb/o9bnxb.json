            "comment": "Hey!. Basically NQ, Prom, and East Campus are areas where you can only buy a parking pass if you have an address there. This is so commuter students/visitors to campus can\u2019t park anywhere, leaving reserved spots for residents only. These areas (Prom, NQ,EC) each have designated permits which you can sign up for on the CSUMB website. You also have the option to just purchase a parking pass for main campus parking (lot 74, Chapman, etc.). I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s any extra, but you don\u2019t have to buy more than one parking pass unless you want to. Hope that helps :)",

    "postText": "Hello all, \n\nI am planning on transferring to csumb this fall and wondering how campus life is like and hoping someone can help and answer a couple questions (thanks)\n\n1.  I am an avid hiker and kayaker and wondering if there are any clubs on campus that are for hikers or kayakers? \n2. I am transferring as a junior wondering which dorm is the best? I am also looking for a roommate for the fall time ( for reference i am  23F)\n3. How the job market is around campus? \n4. Any last minute things I should know before I move up there ? \n\nthank you to anyone who helps me out with some advice !",

            "comment": "1. yes, they have hiking and recreational stuff, as well as a KIN class that offers doing outdoor activities and such. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a hiking club but recreation definitely hosts many events like it.\n\n2. Strawberry in North Quad is already full but Promontory and East Campus is the best for housing, Promontory is a bit of a walk but bearable and it\u2019s super nice, seems like a hotel. East Campus, you need a car to apply and most likely 21 but it\u2019s definitely cheaper ( about $700 a month). It\u2019s like apartment style houses. \n\n3. Many are hiring. The school has a site called Otter Jobs where you can apply and search. Working on campus is super available though, you can make your own schedule and max 20 hours a week.\n\n4. Bring jackets all the time, wherever you go. The weather can be really nice during one time of the day but immediately change up. It gets the coldest at night. Just be prepared lol\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t recommend getting a meal plan. If you do, get one with more dining dollars than meal swipes, you\u2019ll thank me.",

If you don't you might not be able to reach them in the bus...\nProm is the fancy ass ones but I heard Strawberry was the best but idk lol I live a mile off campus with roommates not part of csumb rent is a hell of a lot cheaper. I bike to school. There's also a coastal trail you can bike all the way to Monterey. \nYou can get a job on campus to work with your schedule it seems like they're always hiring I get an email once a week about jobs lol\nThe only thing I can think of is isolation if you don't have a car. You can take a bus but it sucks honestly imo in  a bike you can easily hit the other towns.",

Job market on campus is great. There tends to always be an open position somewhere. I see hiring signs in the near by towns around campus also if you're not wanting to work on campus.",

You may be able to get some helpful advice from someone at the IT Helpdesk in the library if it is more software related ([https://csumb.edu/it/library-it-service-desk](https://csumb.edu/it/library-it-service-desk)). Other than that I would try looking for a place that has good reviews on yelp: [https://www.yelp.com/c/marina-ca-us/itservices](https://www.yelp.com/c/marina-ca-us/itservices). Also, depending on the severity of the issue I might be able to take a look at it if you direct message me. I have some IT experience and am in the CS program.",

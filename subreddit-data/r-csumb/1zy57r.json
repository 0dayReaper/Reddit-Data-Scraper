    "postText": "Anyone have experience with CSUMB's Collab health &amp; human services degree? Specifically with a concentration in social work. I noticed that CSUMB isn't actually accredited for social work, they're currently in \"candidacy\". Will this effect me if I try to transfer to a different school for my MSW? \n\nThank you.",

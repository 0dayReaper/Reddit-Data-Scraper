    "postText": "I apologize if this is not exactly in line with your policies, but I was hoping to promote r/calstate, a new subreddit for the CSU system at large. It's still pretty bare at the moment, so it would be great if you'd help us build up a community! Please help spread the word and thanks for your attention.\n\nAlso since I have received some questions from others, I'll preempt some of the more common ones.\n\n&gt; Why do we even need an r/calstate?!\n\nThe idea, at least to me, of having a more general forum is that there are currently no subreddit currently is designed to encourage dialogue between the various CSUs, their students, staff, faculty, etc. As one of the largest public university systems, there is a surprising lack of collaboration between universities. My naive hope is that this subreddit will make a small dent in the distance and rivalries that separate us, and help us to be more informed about the system as a whole. This leads me to my next point: there seems to be little reporting and discussions about the politics, policies, and news concerning the system at large on the individual school subreddits. It may be helpful in some instances, such as the recent strike, to have a larger discussion between various schools to get different perspectives on the matter (as opposed to smaller discussions in each subreddit. Finally, I think it can represent (as well as a small internet community can) the things that the CSU schools collectively have to offer, even if they don't come with the bragging rights of Harvard or Stanford. These are really my big points and I'm hoping as the community grows, it will evolve further.\n\n&gt; What is your motive and who do you represent?\n\nI am a student at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. I don't really have any other motives than the ones described above.\n\n&gt; I think you're idealistic, foolish, or no one is interested...\n\nGreat! Don't subscribe...or do (?) I know /r/calstate won't solve the world's problems.  But just because something won't change the world doesn't mean things aren't worth doing.  Plus, it's interesting to see how sometimes random pieces of information can become extremely useful or find interesting ways of informing or becoming part of our daily lives.  Anyway, haters gonna hate.",

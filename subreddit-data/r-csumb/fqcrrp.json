    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got accepted by CSUMB  for Fall 2020. I was wondering if any of you could give some advice on whether or not I should attend CSUMB this fall, or why I should choose CSUMB over Chico or Sac State. For some background, I'm from a small town in SoCal and am transferring from a community college. I was gonna visit the schools before making my decision but I obviously can't do that anymore.\n\nAny feedback is appreciated.",

It falls into the Humanities and Communications (HCOM) Major. So out of the 16 or so classes you take for the major, maybe 5-6 of them will be actual journalism courses, and the others will be more general communication/humanities courses. \n\nThere are a lot of opportunities to be involved with the campus newspaper (The Otter Realm) and I even got an internship with the Monterey County Weekly Newspaper which was a lot of fun and a great experience. I also focused on a lot of video-journalism and Monterey was a great place to cover events, arts, entertainment, etc. I personally really enjoyed my time there with that program and would recommend it to incoming students interested in that field.\n\nYou can message me if you have more questions.",

CSUMB has connections but it's in a small town area with few businesses in that particular area. A bigger city might give you better opportunities for experience.",

    "postText": "I've been doing some online routing around and it's all pretty cryptic as to what will or will not be applicable for transferring GE credits. I'm from Nevada and have never heard the term \"General education breadth program\", it sort of makes it seem like if I don't do my Gen Ed specifically at a CSU campus then it won't count. \n\nMy plan has always been to complete GE at a community College before going to CSUMB, but after looking closer I don't think I will if the credits just won't apply..",

Gen Ed classes have certain one that are transferrable credits and some aren\u2019t. So you can\u2019t take any GE class and transfer with it. Talk to your counselor and see where you\u2019re at with transferrable units",

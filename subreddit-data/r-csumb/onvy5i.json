If you went to their office hours they were always willing to help in the best way possible and even give advice about future plans you had later in school or how to get involved in research opportunities like UROC scholar.",

The class sizes are small enough that you will pretty much have the same courses with your peers throughout your tenure at the school You simply don't get that with bigger schools. Hongde is a fantastic chair and Judith Canner was just starting the Stats major when I left, but she's amazing.\n\nFeel free to PM me more questions.",

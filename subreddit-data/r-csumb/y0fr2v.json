    "postText": "Okay y\u2019all, here\u2019s my situation. So I\u2019m currently enrolled full time as well as full time at my job (set to be graduating Spring 2023, but maybe not anymore) and beginning to find my coursework particularly taxing right now like as in I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way I\u2019ll be able to pass all of my courses. I live in East campus and it\u2019s a requirement to be full time in classes and the amount they\u2019ve raised the rent to, I can\u2019t afford to cut my hours at work. I guess I could look for cheaper housing off campus and then not have to be full time anymore. But even then, a move right now would still put a damper on my courses.\nMy counselors next available appointment isn\u2019t until two weeks.\n\nUnsure of what my options are here besides failing a class purposely and retaking it next semester. Posting this on the off chance anyone else has some ideas.",

I\u2019m super behind on classes currently as well.",

Are talking through FAFSA?",

There will be homegrown veggies and a little\nindoor cannabis grow just for house smoke. In a few months.  DM me for more info \n\nAnyways, to OP: unused to intentionally skip assignments in my classes to get through when i was feeling overwhelmed.  Or rather, i would spend like THE minimum amount of rites to get an On an assignment, but a 50 or 60 is better than a 0. Talk to the professors, tell them straight up what your doing, and ask them what the best assignment s would be to do that.  I only had good results with that and taking just a few little assignments out helps a lot.  Then around finals i would find the coolest teacher with a nasty final assignment and just see if i could turn it in a couple weeks late without getting a knock on the grade.  I always framed it like, \u201clook, i can do everything half ass, or if you allow me to do xyz i can give it my full attention so i can ace it\u201d.  Also, sometime there are really long, research\u2019heavy papers and projects that aren\u2019t really worth Shit for grade points, so ditch em. If something that\u2019s gonna take you a week inky gives you the same grade as a 4 answer pop quiz then forget about it, you can use that time to get a jump on something more important.  One more thing is to go through all your syllabus\u2019s and throw everything in a calendar to check for direct conflicts, like two major papers or propane due in different classes.  Those are the big targets for takkkng to the teachers cause that\u2019s where i would always slip up.",

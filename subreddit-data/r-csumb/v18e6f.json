But now it has disappeared? Has anyone else had that happen? Does it mean I won\u2019t be getting the placement I was previously assigned?",

I contacted housing a week or two ago and they said that what I saw on my profile was just a \u201ctest run\u201d in order to make sure the software works.  *eye roll* Now I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019ll get into housing because they haven\u2019t said anything!",

    "postText": "I'm a student who will be transferring in the fall and housing has been a thorn in my side throughout the whole process. The housing tour I took seemed really nice, but I just got assigned to the freshmen dorms. The housing office said that the camous is pretty much full this semester so this is all I can get. Aside from consulting the disability services about housing accomodations (which I've been working on) what can I do about this? A lot of old posts said to avoid being assigned to the dorms but I haven't really had a say in anything.",

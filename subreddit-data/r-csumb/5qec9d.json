The people who didn't have hobbies dropped out or transferred really quick. Thankfully I'm a surfer and was a pro dank smoker, and really enjoyed my time there.",

Almost everyone who played disc golf smoked, get a few discs and find a few guys who are playing that look easy going and ask to tag along and if they can explain the game, I'm sure halfway through the game they'll light one up. It really is a fun game too, God way to meet some people.",

They've been remodeling and building new buildings on campus. 1 mile from campus is a shopping center that just opened a ton of food places. \n\nCampus is growing too; as they add more buildings (classrooms &amp; housing), they're accepting more students.  Some classes are small but you might get a couple lectures that are pretty big (but depends on your major as well). \n\nDefinitely try to participate in activities on campus (Otter days and clubs) if social life is a big factor for you. Otherwise I suggest exploring the city because Monterey County is huge! Also,  a lot of people take trips to San Jose, Santa Cruz and San Francisco since it's simi close",

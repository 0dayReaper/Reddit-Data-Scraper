    "postText": "Hey Otters,\n\nI'm sad to say that the IT department has decided that keeping alumni emails is not on the table. From the alumni association:\n\n&gt;\"...The cyber-security issue and the ransomware threat potential is just too high for them to keep hosting the\u00a0alumni emails. Cost is another issue, but that wasn't the\u00a0motivating factor behind the decision.\"\n\nThis is very sad news to hear and I am very disappointed in the school decision, as I imagine you all are as well. Supposedly there will be an email going out \"soon\" but when specifically was not specified. \n\nPrepare yourselves by backing up important materials and changing emails on important accounts. Also, let other alumni know so they can take action before it's too late.",

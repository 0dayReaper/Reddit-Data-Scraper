You can either do the applied track or theoretical track (tracks are suggestions for classes depending on your goals, not official concentrations). In both tracks, you will learn R studio programming. If you want to work right after bachelors, expect to take more classes outside of stat depending on your career goals. If you pick theoretical, expect math theory and statistical theory to prepare you for grad. If you have questions, let me know.",

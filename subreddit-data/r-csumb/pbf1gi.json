    "postText": "(Just a dumb rant)I might just be missing something, but I asked some of the staff in  the cafeteria and nobody knew where the peanut butter was. It probably wasn't there. The staff were nice about it and just doing their job. If you look up the menu online peanut butter is supposed to be an everyday item. I dont really eat anything that isnt vegan, because I am very allergic to dairy and butter is snuck in everything. I also dont care for the taste of meat and eggs. Fuck I guess Im stuck with oatmeal, fruit, and an unseasoned bagel. Im fortunate this is the worst of my problems.",

Whenever they have peanut butter make sure to borderline hoard that shit, it goes fast. And most people eat it. \n\nDuring my freshman year I stuck with fruit and peanut butter/cereals with oat milk for breakfast. A salad and maybe some beans or whatever else I can find that's vegan for lunch, and for dinner they had an entire station for vegan food which was usually better than most of the other stuff they had. Really hoping they up their food options sooner than later. Hoping the best for you my guy.",

And then for the whole apartment there is a coffee table, bar chairs for the small island, love seat and chair. That\u2019s all I can think of right now",

I thought I\u2019d get bar chairs, a couch, and a love seat, but they ended up giving me two couches and an actual table. I didn\u2019t get a dresser or a nightstand either. I live in Park 1 and they definitely gave me older looking furniture, whereas I have two friends in Park 2 and one has the more modern newer furniture like the bar chairs, and one has the same furniture as me. But usually everyone gets a couch, desk, and coffee table. It\u2019s kinda based on luck if I may say so myself.",

Lol\n\nAlso, I heard people get their own units cuz of Covid precautions (whereas normally they have 2-3 people per unit). Is this true?\n\nThanks for the info tho!",

And yes! you are in your own unit. I moved in later then everyone else, and some staff asked me preferences for parks but I didn\u2019t know the differences at the time, nor wanted to be too picky. I\u2019d recommend you try to get park 2 cause there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll get the better furniture. Not to mention, park 2 also has bigger balconies.. so I was kinda bummed after finding out and moving in haha. My friends in park 2 also somehow have access to the second bedroom, but the second bedroom is locked for me in park 1!",

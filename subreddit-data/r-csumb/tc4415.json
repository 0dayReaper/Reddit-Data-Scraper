You don't have to be a marine bio major to take them! There's also a few clubs you can join. Not too many parties this semester. Last semester was wild compared to this one lol",

I wouldnt know i dont have a meal plan. Its a commuter school. Most of the people who go there live in the area so theres no big sociableness to the school. Its well known even the deans have complained about how the students only go to class then go home. Also the gym hours change everyday. So weird. Weather is the same everyday no matter the season. Cold and foggy. Ive lived there 20 years so im used to all this but to those coming in from out of town these are the common things i hear",

The survey asks fundamental questions, and at the end, it gives you the opportunity to sign up for a raffle for a few gift cards. Thanks, I appreciate your help; feel free to share with your friends that attended different universities. Thanks.\n\nhttps://csumb.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_85F0iRfbo688tfM",

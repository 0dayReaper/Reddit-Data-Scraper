            "comment": "It's good! The classes are small and the teachers are knowledgable. They will like you if you are attentive in class, come into office hours and ask questions, or just reach out in general. A few teachers even have online office hours. All of them want you to succeed and will be very helpful if you have questions. Since the department is small, you will have some of the same teachers multiple times. This is both bad and good depending on your view of the teachers. Regardless, it  will allow you join a community and the department seems to have a good one.\n\nThe department is also trying to expand, so they will be creating opportunities in order to draw more students. Hongde Hu, the department chair there is the guy to talk to about jobs, internships, and other programs, and he recently obtained a grant that will allow him to make being a math major at CSUMB better.\n",

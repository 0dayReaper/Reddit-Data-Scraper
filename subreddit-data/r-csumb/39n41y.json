    "postText": "Hey all. I am a host of a local interest podcast recorded in Salinas called Salinas Underground. We talk about the Salinas we all grew up in which is much different than the Salinas believe exists. We love our town and in the last year we have been able to share it with thousands of people and have received some excellent feedback. I think Salinas is missing a huge opportunity in essentially ignoring CSUMB and the thousands of people that go to school there. I was wondering if there was anyone that is willing to come the show and share your experience about the relationship between Salinas and CSUMB. If anyone would like to come on the show or knows someone that might send me a message and we will get you on! Thanks.",

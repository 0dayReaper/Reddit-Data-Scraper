My roommate's classes are held on the Salinas campus, it doesn't seem like the city bus stops in East Campus so she absolutely needs a car to get to her classes. I'm able to get by using the school shuttle to get to and from my classes on the main campus. Personally, I feel the need to have a set of wheels (preferably a car) to get around town.",

If you do decide to come, the placement coordinator will send out a form so they can match you with the best co-teacher and that would be a good moment to reach out about your carpool needs. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve seen it before.",

If so, you would almost certainly need a reliable transportation to get from your classroom field placement to CSUMB campus multiple times a week. They moved a lot of the classes to hybrid, but nearly all still meet every other week on campus. With the timing of your K-12 school day, depending on where your placement is, the commute is very tight for some candidates. Honestly I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s possible w/o reliable transportation.",

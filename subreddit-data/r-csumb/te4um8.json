    "postText": "okay im ngl i kind of applied on a whim because some marine bio youtuber i used to watch talked about it a lot. i only applied to 2 schools for marine bio (csumb and uncw, and i only got accepted for the spring semester at uncw) and after reading the subreddit i'm just kind of nervous, especially because since i applied (which was like november), i'm not sure i want to leave home anymore lol. i'm not too worried abt that because i'll have to move relatively far no matter where i go to college, but i know the campus isn't super lively. would you guys say the area in general is worth it?\n\ni know this question is kind of silly but i really wanted some input because i was hyped about this school and the idea of the aquarium and everything for months and now i'm just not sure haha",

            "comment": "Honestly this school is what you make of it. If you live on campus, and only go to class, and right back to your dorm/apartment, then it's not the most phenomenal campus. However, being close to Monterey Bay Aquarium, if you really end up pursuing that, it's one of the absolute best aquariums and marine research institutes to my understanding, so the opportunities are hard to dismiss.\n\nYou absolutely would want reliable personal transport in this area, though. From campus, there's an okay shopping plaza about a 45 minute walk from campus, but otherwise you'll be relying on MST public transport, or personal transportation.",

It was a great decision, I regret nothing and I'm still here 10 years later.\n\nI lived in Salinas for 6 months before getting into East Campus. I had/have a motorcycle, so I made friends quick with local riders. Riding down the coast or Carmel Valley was every weekend. Going to Laguna Seca every chance I could. Took SCUBA classes my last semester. Beach bonfires on the weekends. Never a flake of snow. It's been a dream.",

I didn't realize I would stay so long, but here I am. I didn't come originally to go to CSUMB but ended up coming back to attend and now go to grad school in the area. It's a great area for that type of field.",

            "comment": "Great location for marine science. We have a diving program you can get certified with as a class you can take. Lots of places to kayak too, beach is a close walk from campus but passes by some abandoned buildings. We have an undergraduate research program that will set you up with research as early as your interested at no cost. And a free tutoring center on most subjects. That being said it\u2019s not a college town like other universities. We are built on a military base, it\u2019s about a 20ish minute walk to the store plaza with target, Marshall\u2019s, a movie theater and other stuff plus food. But you can ride the bus for free as a student to go up to Monterey or pacific grove. Campus has access to fort ord trails so if you like to explore nature, it\u2019s perfect. Very recreation focused campus, also very open and accepting with a huge part of our culture focused on BIPOC and queer communities. It\u2019s also the cheapest CSU. \n\nReally just depends on if that\u2019s what your looking for. Lots of opportunities here, it\u2019s just not city life basically. But the housing on campus is nice, especially compared to other campuses for some of it. We also have a huge community of students into things like anime and music and arts so if you like that stuff there are people for that. \n\nThe campus isn\u2019t as lively as before covid, it\u2019s still recovering from that as everyone isn\u2019t as social as before, but it\u2019s ramping back up and I\u2019m sure by next year there will be way more in person events. Party life is meh but it\u2019s there.",

It\u2019s filled with nature and you can see the ocean from many spots on campus. There are crazy sunsets and it\u2019s dark so many constellations at night. I love it here, but there is downsides to all of that. Because the area is so beautiful to look at, it means everything is also pretty far away and that\u2019s why everyone agrees that a car or something is a must. Or have a friend with a car. It\u2019s not like a lot of cities in California where you can easily get everything you need nearby. And there isn\u2019t much of a nightlife so you gotta ask around about clubs or other social opportunities. So a fair amount of people don\u2019t like it and a fair amount do and it\u2019s simply just preference.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s only worth it if you\u2019re really passionate about marine biology and really want to experience the central coast. I\u2019m not familiar with the field but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s other universities and Aquariums on the East Coast that can offer good marine biology research so you don\u2019t move that far from NC. And yeah the campus is dead socially, especially after online classes it feels like most people forgot how to carry a conversation and interact in class. If you\u2019re already having doubts, the year round cold and foggy weather, shit traffic, lack of a nightlife, and high prices of gas and rent will probably bog you down more. Then again, I\u2019m just biased cause I grew up in this area and have always hated it.",

How fast is the cable internet and whose the provider? Are there restricted sites? Can I choose my friend to be my roommate?\n\nthanks.\n",

            "comment": "Unless it is changed you can choose your friend as a roommate.\n\nThe internet is pretty fast but hits lag spikes. I don't know who the provider is. I believe it is $525 each.\n\nThis is the housing phone number (831) 582-3378.\n\nTypically freshmen cannot live in east campus. \n",

Plus you might want to live on main campus, you can meet lots of people your age very easily that way. ",

            "comment": "you must be at least a junior by credit status i believe thats 60 or 90 units and you must be taking a minimum of 12 units a semester or they will kick you out. its 525 a person and you can request who you want to be your roommate but you might get stuck with a random 3rd. the internet is decent during the day but terrible from about 7pm-1am. All cars must have a parking permit, they ticket every 2 weeks or so and you get a 1 car garage that you can have guest park in if your too lazy to get them a guest pass. Repairs tend to come extremely slow and but the apartments are the best size you'll get for anything on campus. they have gotten strict about parties so you need to have a gathering permit if you want more then 10 people over. if you have any questions let me know i just moved out of there in december after living there 2 years",

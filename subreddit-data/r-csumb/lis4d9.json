    "postText": "So, I'm twenty-eight, going back to school full time for basically the first time since dropping out at twenty. So far I've been accepted at CSUMB, SFSU, and Cal State LA. A factor in which college I decide to go with is what the community is like for older/returning/non-traditional students there. Does anyone have any opinions or information about what it's like being an older student at CSUMB?\n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone who responded to this post. Since then, I've confirmed my conditional acceptance, and if all goes well, I'll be going to CSUMB this fall!",

I've been through the whole 'college experience' a couple of times and will have three associates, Covid was really my deciding factor to go back because the culinary industry is a bit of a mess. Right now Monterey is my top pick mostly because I can commute there. If you do decide to go maybe we'll end up meeting. :)",

I am 43, and I have been the oldest or one of two or three over 30 in most of my classes. I notice that a lot of people seem to be more in their early to mid-twenties. I was nervous at first, but have not felt awkward or unwelcome in any class so far.",

That\u2019s one of the things I rlly like about it is that it\u2019s very open and accepting to everyone.\n\nThe campus makes a big effort to be inclusive of everyone and their needs. They are really big on mental health needs too, especially in the science department. Which is usually very uncommon.",

I met tons of older students up in humboldt and my friends were HSU students at the time so I met their friends too and also HSU did have older students. So far, I really haven\u2019t met any older students or I didn\u2019t even realize they\u2019re older??  I am 23 and from what I understand most of my classmates have been friends since they were in freshman dorms. They\u2019re improving support for transfer students by using a building specifically for Transfer students (I think it is amazing) and I am pretty sure I heard plans before the pandemic that they were trying to have a floor in promontory specifically for transfer students, I was considering giving it a shot cuz I thought I could work it out financially. Smhhh Dang pandemic!",

    "postText": "Hello! I currently go to csusm (live in socal) I like it a lot !. Its my second year in college and my decisions were between sdsu,csusm, and of course csumb. My grandma and his wife are building a house in Salinas and my mom asked me if I would possibly go to school up there and live with them next year. Id save a lot of money since I drive about an hour to csusm 3 times a week plus the parking permit (literally 320 PER semester), and other things. I was planning of going to csumb to major in marine biology but I currently major in sociology at csusm but I'm currently stuck to what I want to do honestly. anyways, I want to know those who are currently attending csumb, do you love it or wish you went somewhere else ? Hows campus life? Do any of you guys play sports ?(and are the teams good/decent) And those who transferred to csumb do you regret transferring there? thank you !",

            "comment": "well first of all, the parking permits are about 320 for the YEAR so that\u2019s already another cost you\u2019ll have cut down. can\u2019t speak for marine bio, although i imagine it would be really cool just by virtue of the school being located in a hotbed of biodiversity, but the social and behavioral science dept (you can concentrate on sociology) is fine, there\u2019s a lot of interesting professors and you can take a wide variety of classes that aren\u2019t limited to theory or social studies  like global studies and collaborative health and human services, so that\u2019s why i like it. as for sports, there\u2019s not a huge culture here compared to most other schools, i\u2019ve done intramural soccer and basketball and it\u2019s pretty low key, usually games are once a week and practices are up to the discretion of the team, but it all depends on the sport of course. i don\u2019t go to sports games myself though so i don\u2019t really know what that\u2019s like. hope this helps",

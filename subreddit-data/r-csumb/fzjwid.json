    "postText": "Hey so I was just wondering if anyone knew how the school decides where to place students in dorm rooms, like what is the decision process based upon. Also, I made a roommate group with my friend who is also attending CSUMB but apparently that will not ensure that we room together. Is that true? I just wanted to have some kind of idea as to how the housing is decided so my friend and I can plan for being in the same room or not. Thanks.",

I\u2019m not sure how it works exactly but I think you\u2019ll be put with who you want, just make sure you select all the same answers on the housing application!",

Apparently, regardless of whether your incoming freshman or incoming transfer, youre not allowed to pick your roommates. Which is...odd. Considering that they dont lock it, but eh whatever.",

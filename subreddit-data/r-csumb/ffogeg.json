Many important classes are once a year so expect to be there 5 years if you\u2019re straight out of hs and 2-3 as a transfer. Who knows really they\u2019re understaffed on professors. From what my gf has told be it was an aight program she had some fun classes but many were only okay. Nothing great definitely not somewhere you want to go if you wanna do research afterwards",

Pretty usual advice for college degrees in general but especially true for marine science",

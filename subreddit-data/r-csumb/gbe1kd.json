But does anyone have any recommendations for a cheaper place? I'm trying to reduce my debt as much as possible.",

People used to do that, the cops started cracking down on it because this school is a money pit.\n\nBy the way, please take the bus to campus, the traffic cops fucking suck and will give you a ticket for bieng parked 1 single centimeter off the curb.",

            "comment": "In my case, I\u2019m faculty and was parked in a disabled space but forgot to hang my placard from the rearview mirror. So they gave me a $275 ticket which I immediately appealed. I   heard nothing from them for a month and then received a \u201ccourtesy notice\u201c saying now I owed $500. When I called them, they told me they had reviewed my case, reduced it to $20, emailed me (I never received these emails), and then after 20 days raised it back to the original fine plus a chunky late fee. \n\nAll of this is administered by a shady company in Turlock contracted to CSU called Parking Management Bureau that has tons of Better Business Bureau complaints against it.\n\nWhile most of that is in accordance with the California vehicle code, their trick of Lowering the fine as a \u201ccourtesy\u201d but not dismissing it and subsequently raising it again after 20 days appears to be unlawful. Unsurprisingly, the CSUMB parking office was completely unhelpful and even hostile. I took up the situation with CSUMB\u2018s general counsel to see if they could look into it.",

Then they would sit there and wait until everyone's time was up and ticket every single car knowing full well 5 minutes later the students would be returning as class let out. They did this so you had to buy a parking pass. I refused though, I would go out and drop a nickel in the meter every day halfway through class. I don't care if I was taking a final, I would still go. Even if I needed to park every single day, at that time, feeding a meter daily was about half as much as a pass.",

The Chapman machine just flat out doesn't work unless someone calls them to reset it for the day. Even though I could even purchase a ticket because THEIR machine was busted, they did not lower my amount at all so I still had to pay 45 bucks for their shitty machine.\n\nThe second one was because I had the windows cracked, which let the breeze in to flip my daily pass over. I guess I'll just let my car boil next time. They reduced that one since I did have a valid one, and the fucking cop took a picture of the flipped over pass, so it should have just been thrown out. I still had to pay 20 bucks on top of the 5 dollars I paid for the pass that day.\n\nThe third time, I recently forgot to display my handicap placard. I wasn't even gone for a full hour and then I remembered so I ran out only to find that 275 dollar ticket sitting on the windshield. I got it reduced to 20 bucks, but once again I had a valid placard so it should have just been thrown out. But of course, now I'm so paranoid that I don't park in the handicap spots now since they just flash around tickets whenever they feel like it. This of course means that most days I have to park like 2 or 3 parking lots aways, considering they don't even have enough parking spots to host the STAFF.\n\nIt would be one thing if they had hardly any parking, but they were more relaxed on the tickets, or vice versa. But the fact that they have hardly any parking nearby anything and they are straight up dicks about tickets is a bad combination. In the Chapman lot, they have the balls to put up a sign that says you're not allowed to park in the faded spots in the middle of the handicap area, despite that being a perfectly okay thing to do in any normal person's mind.",

When they pulled me over here and my paper was expired by 3 days I told them I have actual insurance and I'd call my agent to send me the new paper. That was at 7:59am. Apparently my insurance opens at 8, so I asked him to wait 30 seconds so I can call again and get the proof. He started yelling that he can arrest me for not cooperating (I didn't want to sign that I am driving without insurance). I politely explained Ill call them again and rolled up my window and called again. By the end of the 3 minute call there were 2 more cars he called as backup. HE CALLED BACKUP ON ME! Luckily there was an older cop who was much calmer and he looked at the email the insurance sent me and he wad like great! Have a good day! \n\nThat was on what I think is the last street that is not considered ONNNNN campus. But it was right there. I also got a speeding ticket for going 41 in 35 zone. Not kidding.",

Speeding 5 miles over the limit, my parking permit reflecting too bright and driving with headphones on. All in all I paid about $700 for those tickets and I remember it being one of the worst periods in my life because spending that amount of money on tickets was impossible at the time.",

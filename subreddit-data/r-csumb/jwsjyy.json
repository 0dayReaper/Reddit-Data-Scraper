Last I saw they didn\u2019t have enough members to make a full wind ensemble and had to recruit members from the local high school. They have zero funding so the entire department is paid for out of the music directors pockets or any supplies that can be pilfered from Seaside High school. \n\nThere is a Latin jazz band however called Sharp 9 who would appreciate a Brazilian jazz guitarist.",

    "postText": " \n\nI am currently a high school student and will be applying for colleges in the future. I'm 90% sure I want to be a Film Major. I saw that Cal State Monterey Bay has a Film program and I looked for more information from alumni and current students, but found none. CSUMB looks like an awesome school but I'd like to know more about the Film and Digital Media Major/Program. - Hows the facility/studios? - Overall Experience? - How much of it is critical studies and how much of it is hands on production work? - Professors? - Do you feel that the knowledge you gained is worth the trouble of going to college? - How easy is it to get in a internship or entry level job after this program in college? - Is CSUMB fun? - How does it compare to other film programs? - How is the campus?",

            "comment": "Lots of questions. I'll do my best...\n\nI was there about 10 years ago, and the film major was called something different but it's probably similar to how it is now. The facilities were very state-of-the-art at that time, not sure if they've kept them up to date, but I'd have to assume they did. The professors I had were great, very personable, friendly and knowledgeable. The school was very small at that time, and probably still is relatively small, so class sizes were like 12-30 people for most classes. What was nice about the film program is I felt like there was always an opportunity to work on projects with other students. For example, even as a freshman, before I had any real experience in film besides amateur stuff I had done on my own in high-school, I was working on a Senior Capstone project in my first semester helping set up scenes and even doing some camera work. The program itself was very hands-on in every level of production. I didn't continue with film, I became more interested in Journalism in my third year, so I changed to that major before I was too far along to switch, so I can't answer some of the questions there.\n\nAs far as CSUMB itself as a campus and college experience, you should really visit and see for yourself when school is in session. The one major downside about the campus is you can't walk anywhere from there if you live on-campus. You can walk around to different places on campus, and there were some decent places to eat and even a bar or two, but besides that it can get boring if you don't have a vehicle. Most campuses I've seen are in the middle of a town, so you can literally walk to a grocery store, or out into town or just hang around or whatever, which is ideal. However, there are decent amenities there so it's not that bad. I'd highly recommend joining a club (I got really involved with Disc Golf) or playing some intramural sports, since it's a great way to meet people and you'll have fun things to do on campus.\n\nLiving in Monterey is pretty awesome, especially if you like hiking, going to the beach, eating good food, checking out some touristy stuff like the Aquarium, Pacific Grove, Carmel. I lived there for several years after college and really enjoyed the city itself.\n\nIf you have more questions like about places to look for housing off-campus, or anything else in general, let me know and I'd be happy to offer more knowledge.",

            "comment": "I graduated with a CART degree last fall! I had a great time in the program!\n\nThe professors are really easy to get along with and are very laid back. \n\nAs with any school, you get out what you put in. I was pretty serious about studying and class and deans listed it through. At the same time I graduated with some people that skated through doing the minimum and they also got a degree. \n\nThe benefit of CSUMB's program is your access to equipment and the connections you can make. My suggestion is to sign on to help out on as many Capstone projects as you can! What you end up doing is networking while learning the ropes of short film production. Even if you aren't in any production classes, you still get to learn how stuff works. When you're working on Capstones, you are working with students at all levels, mostly those that are close to graduating. \n\nWhat you end up doing is making connections with students who go out and get industry jobs. The more people you get to know the more opportunities you may have in the future. Especially in an industry that is all about who you know! \n\nAs a recent grad, I had a great time with the professors as well! The class sizes are generally pretty small so if you want to get to know them, because they all have industry experience, you can. ",

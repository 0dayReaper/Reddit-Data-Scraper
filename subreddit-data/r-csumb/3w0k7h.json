            "comment": "I graduated in 2005 from SBS (Anthropology concentration) and went to grad school at a top research university directly after. If I had wanted to go the route of becoming a professor of anthropology I have no doubt I could have, but I decided to become a software engineer instead and have had no problem doing that with my anthropology degree from CSUMB.\n\nThe truth is that some companies care a lot about where you got your degree and others don't. In my opinion, you should stay away from places where a degree from UCLA will get you a job but a degree from CSUMB won't. I'm not saying that every CSUMB grad will land the job of their dreams in their chosen profession, but it's possible to do and not rare.\n\nFor those still in school, please try to find summer internships in the area you want to work. This does a few things for you. First, it helps solidify that this is the kind of work you actually want to do long-term. Second, it gives you some nice real-world experience. Third, many companies will hire their interns when they graduate, assuming they had a good experience with them.\n\nHonestly, I think there's plenty of jobs for people who are passionate about their work and are capable, competent, learn quickly, and don't make major mistakes. Hell, just passion is hard to find so that plus one of the other qualities is probably enough to get you started.\n\nI'm also happy to talk to anyone who has questions in this area or want to know about software engineering, startups, etc.",

I was fortunate enough to have had jobs in my field since I started at community college and throughout my education at csumb. I would say having applicable experience and networking are way more important than your alma mater.",

Upon graduation, I went full time and still live and work in Monterey.\n\nWhere you graduate isn't really that important for 95% of jobs. Just graduating is all that really matters.",

            "comment": "Good question, I had similar concerns. I got a job in my last two months of school as an assistant to a top producing real estate team. Started taking real estate classes immediately after graduating, got my license and am now a Realtor on their team. Whenever they introduce me to new people, they happily mention that I'm a recent CSUMB graduate, I definitely didn't expect that initially, but I think local businesses are looking to recruit young, motivated professionals that want to make a name for themselves in the area. There's a lot of opportunity here, you just have to know where to look, and it all starts by networking with the right people. Get involved in the community, be social, talk to wealthy people whenever you can, get a job in food service while you're in college - preferably at a country club. Learn a marketable skill in your free time. I learned to build websites and became familiar with search engine optimization, got a SEO gig making close to $40 an hour to pay the bills while I got my real estate license, now diving into real estate. Give me a call if anyone you know is looking to buy or sell! Here's my website. www.zachbrooksherrealtor.com\n\nGood luck!!",

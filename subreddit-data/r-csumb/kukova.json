Also is it possible to apply with a roommate already so we can live there together? We also have two dogs. Is it harder to get accepted if you have animals? \nThank you in advance!!",

It was started by student a few years back to help students find local housing. You can post some info about you and what your looking for, and look through posts where people are offering rooms or apartments to rent. I found my current living situation through it because dorms closed down. Def apply to east campus, but this could help you look if that doesn\u2019t work out",

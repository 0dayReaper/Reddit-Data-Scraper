    "postText": "I went to CSUMB Spring 2016 and am trying to transfer the classes I took there to another university. However, whenever I try to login to my student portal it tells me that I've failed to login. I tried to change my password by having a confirmation email sent to my email but I never receive anything so I cannot change anything. Has this been a problem for anyone else? P.S. I had to do a supplemental application on Jan 4 and was able to login.",

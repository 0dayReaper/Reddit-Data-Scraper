Probably your roommates know someone and it will be fine. Other than parties there are sometimes events at school, especially during the start of the semester Wich could be a good place to find new friends. \nI would recommend joining one of the club's at school, if you are computer science I would really recommend the programming team \ud83d\ude09",

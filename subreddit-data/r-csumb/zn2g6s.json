    "postText": "I am transferring from cc to csumb for the Spring and the cost is 9775 but after Fasfa I pay 2900. Csumb split my payments over three installments. So now I am wondering if I wait until the second disbursement (where my aid ends) to make any sort of payment myself or do I need to use my own money for my first installment and then Fasfa sends me my money later?",

            "comment": "Hopefully you already got your answer from the aid office, but today (friday the 27t) *should* be the last day of disbursments. In the event that all your aid has been paid out and you still have a remaining fee you\u2019ll need to pay out of pocket. Anyhow, you have till the add/drop deadline (Feb 6) to pay, so I\u2019d probably reach out to the aid office before then and ask. I\u2019d strongly reccomend email, they typically get back within an hour or two. Almost never answer the phone",

I was wondering **what would you say is the best dorm hall or apartment on campus?** I'm not too picky on anything but the fact that I want to be living by myself! Thank you &lt;3",

The biggest mistake I made was not thinking about the added prices as well as the semester rate. The residence hall housing requires the most expensive meal plan (2,279) &amp; north quad you have the option to pay 1,405. And if you bring a car, the permit prices differ as well! What helped me was writing down all the added costs that comes along w/ your housing choices &amp; making a separate pros and cons list. \nI currently live in north quad pinnacles and would be more than happy to send you a room tour! Rlly frustrated me when I was applying that there wasn\u2019t a 360 tour for pinnacles &amp; vineyard.",

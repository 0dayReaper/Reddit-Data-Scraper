I was super worried about food choices on campus and visiting campus it looks like if I lived there I would actually have 0 things to eat at all. They literally offer no options at all for my diet preference, let alone good food at all. So sad that the OE is closed, was genuinely looking forward to it after bike rides. \n\nI had a feeling gym and recreational stuff would be super restricted so I moved into seaside, get my own food got my own weights and bike. It just sucks I wont be able to see as many people this semester because I wont be there that often(no in person classes).",

The bowls and the veggie wrap were so good, not to mention I could always get fries if i really want. Hopefully the OE opens up again soon.",

In case you have no heard yet, this year our team is hosting the FIRST hip-hop dance showcase in Santa Cruz. Teams from across California are coming to perform and I'm sure this would be one of the only times a lot of you will be able to attend a hip-hop dance showcase so why not? Tickets are going fast so I definitely encourage you to get yours now and be a part of history!\n\nEn Route\n\nSaturday May 23, 2015\n\nCabrillo College Crocker Theater\n\nDoors Open 5:30PM | Show Starts 6:00PM\n\nPresale: $15 Student | $20 General\n\nAt the Door: $20 Student | $25 General\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/913558108662830/",

And there\u2019s no information on the school districts websites\n\nAnd since East campus is limiting housing I\u2019m gonna have to find a private apartment to move into this fall if classes are hybrid or in person, even though my actual classes are online; wasting thousands of dollars in rent money.\n\nAnyone have any info?",

The superintendents of the districts are in close communication with one another and on similar timelines. Right now they are gathering feedback on possible solutions for sy 20-21 from stakeholders (teachers, parents, students, community, etc). I suspect the administrators for each district will then analyze the results of the surveys and, finally, make a proposal to the district\u2019s board of directors. Right now, the CDE has released guidelines for schools to develop multiple plans for school attendance next year, with the requirement that schools be flexible in case of Corona spikes. You can find that online. \n\nSo, there\u2019s no way to answer your question with a yes or no. I suggest you keep your eye on edjoin and apply to everything you can. Best of luck. You will figure it out like the rest of us.  Because that\u2019s what teachers do.\n\nEdit: grammar.",

    "postText": "Parking services needs to acknowledge that lot 59 is barely a bandaid on the parking problem at csumb, and certainly not a solution. For students with jobs, needing to search for parking, wait for a shuttle, or walk 20 minutes to class is not feasible, especially if your job schedules you up to half an hour before class starts. For faculty, I\u2019m not being paid to arrive to campus a half hour early when I\u2019m working on campus 8 hours most days and 10 hours some days. I\u2019m barely being paid enough for the amount I\u2019m working so having to fuck around with parking is too much, not to mention they\u2019re charging me for the right to search for a parking space or walk half a mile. Solutions or discounted parking passes, full stop.",

The university had plenty of parking, but then decided that was a problem and took it on themselves to build on top of the parking lots, rip them out and otherwise make car ownership (which is somewhat a necessity at CSUMB) painful.",

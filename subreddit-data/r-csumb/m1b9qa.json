I'm hoping to learn about your experiences in these different housing options that the campus has so I could see what fits me best. \n\nI have a general idea about the differences between the housing options thanks to this [link](https://csumb.edu/housing/housing-options). I'm interested to hear what was the best housing option for you, and why.",

Your going to be living in the library for the most part anyways lol. \n\nIf you are able to find housing off campus that's still nearby it's honestly the best way to go because you don't have to pay for parking and you can be an actual adult who doesn't have constant inspections and rules to follow. \n\nI recommend looking at the homeless otters of CSUMB Facebook page. There are usually a lot of folks looking for a roommate. \n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "East campus was great while I was there. Got a little loud partying sometimes but, over all not bad. Also, before we left they had electric scooters that could take you to the little gas station for snacks or limited fresh produce by east campus. I never use the scooter cuz I\u2019m not the most coordinated human but, I know it\u2019s a good option. The price of the scooter was also cheaper if you\u2019re on Calfresh, and they were good alternative if you missed the bus and didn\u2019t want to drive. However can\u2019t be sure that those will come back this fall but probably before you leave but if they do they will have \u2018test days\u2019 for you to try it out for free. Sometimes the bus was too full for people which really sucked.",

For parties to really be a problem it basically has to be your neighbor throwing an absolute rager. \n\nEast Campus was my preferred housing situation while I was going to school at CSUMB, but you can also find rooms for rent in the military housing neighborhoods directly South of the campus. The houses are a bit run down generally but it's very much not student housing, lots of families and just people working who live there, and military. \n\nLike others have mentioned, Homeless Otters of CSUMB on Facebook is a great place to start if you're looking for housing not associated with the school.",

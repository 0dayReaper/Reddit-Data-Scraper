    "postText": "It's kind of surprising that we don't have a team for any form of eSports. Personally, I know of plenty of people who would love to have one or be a part of one, myself included. Schools like Harvard or San Jose State have them, and a university in Chicago is treating them like actual sports, giving people the same scholarships as actual athletes. So why don't we start a team? There's enough highly competitive games that it could work, like Hearthstone or League of Legends. Plus, students could benefit greatly since most tournaments held go towards tuition. Can we make this happen? I scincerely hope so. I'd love to represent my school by playing these games and plus competition is fun. Let's make it happen",

I know the president from last year but haven't been able to get into contact with him to ask about this years presidents. I also want to know what happened to the smash club because I am a big Melee player. Hopefully we can possibly set something up if these clubs are not active anymore.  ",

I asked my roommates, who are both transfer students, and they told me that they never received this message but know that it only applies to freshman. Anyways, I mostly ignored it until today when I got another message telling me that it's a requirement for me so that I can stay in good standing with the university. I don't know anyone else who has received that or who has completed the program so I am led to believe that it's bs. Has anyone completed this program?",

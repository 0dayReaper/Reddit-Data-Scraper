            "comment": "Definitely not. Usually there is a lengthy selection process where you pick from a list of student accounts with their social media accounts to talk to. From that narrowed down list you then go to campus and there is a blind roommate date type event where you meet the people you talked to in person. If you get along, you then draft a roommate agreement with that person (noise levels, company, types of music allowed in dorm) and that\u2019s the end of it.",

            "comment": "The process may have changed since I was a freshman (fall '19), but there is usually some time to look for/choose roommates before getting assigned. If you made your housing app web profile public (marked \"yes\" for roommate search process), you can browse other students' profiles and chat with them. From there you could form roommate groups if you hit it off with people. If you didn't hit it off you were randomly assigned. If you marked \"no\" for being part of the roommate search process, I think you just get randomly assigned automatically (though I never did this, so I'm not sure).\n\nAnyways sorry you got randomly assigned. I was also randomly assigned roommates my freshman year as did many of my friends, so it's very normal to be in your position.",

I have a feeling they weren't up to code and were forced to rebuild them, but as a cost saving measure they built them as small as possible...they rebuilt Schoonover too but they're the same size they were if not a bit larger.\n\nThey are remodeling a lot of aspects about east campus though. A lot are huge improvements - new windows, doors, paint, garage doors, etc. But the new decks in the student section are a bit ridiculous.",

But east campus is a really great deal and a nice place to live, so it's not the biggest issue.",

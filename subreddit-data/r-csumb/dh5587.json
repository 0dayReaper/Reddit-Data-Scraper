Also, you might be surprised how many students come from SoCal, you might feel right at home.\n\nAs a transfer student who commuted an hour plus to get to campus everyday. I have to say you should definitely live on campus. \n\nCSUMB is the cheapest CSU in the state. Many of the buildings are ramshackle, but that's what gives it it's charm. \n\nThis place can be no frills, but it's fun and cheap. If you get in, your in for a fun ride.",

Free housing is not worth being ruled by people who don't understand that you have to be a student, get a second job, and still manage your own mental health while complying with every bullshit new thing that pops into their heads (aka fuck the prostaff). Pay rent and enjoy college.",

This year they tried to make RA's do rounds at 2am while still having to do 10pm and 12am rounds. The only reason it wasn't implemented was because every RA took a stand against it. Unfortunately the RA's themselves are cliquey and don't come together often so bullshit rules often get added and RA's just have to deal with their ever increasing work load. That's the worst part because it's so unpredictable. \n\nAnything specific you wanted to know?",

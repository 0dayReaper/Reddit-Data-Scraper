I have a little bit of retail experience (the vast majority of my job history is working with animals, which is why I'm struggling to hear back from places I think). Are any on-campus places still hiring? I already applied to the Starbucks.",

But it\u2019s a good place to find off campus jobs that are looking to hire current students. It\u2019s where I got my current job which is pretty cool, pays well, and is related to my major.",

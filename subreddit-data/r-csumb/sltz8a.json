Does anyone know the timeframe for when we will hear back on admission into the school psychology program? Program deadline was February 1st. I looked online, but I couldn\u2019t find any certain timeframes for graduate programs. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019ll take about a month to hear back, is that about right? Thank you!",

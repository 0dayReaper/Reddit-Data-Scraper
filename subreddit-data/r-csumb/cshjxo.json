    "postText": "I'm an international student coming from the UK and I've been looking at concerts in Santa Cruz/San Jose. What is the best way to get to these places from CSUMB? As a Londoner I never learned to drive so trying to work out if there are ways of doing it by public transport. I know of the MST bus to get there but can I use it to get back as well? And is there a last bus back to Monterey, or does it run through the night?\n\nThanks in advance x",

Google maps has a transit button that should get you the rout.\n\n(P.S. when in Cali... don\u2019t call it Cali. We usually say the whole word here)",

It's passable within large metropolitan areas (within the San Francisco/San Jose/Oakland area, for example) but once you get to areas with lower population density it might as well not exist, at least as far as traveling between cities. What I did when I was younger and didn't drive was offer to buy a second ticket for a friend, in exchange for a ride. Good luck!",

I would highly recommend the Catalyst in santa Cruz, great bands and cheap tickets but can get crowded because it's a smaller venue. Enjoy your time in the states!",

Pretty much the same story for Santa Cruz. \nIt's possible, but you're going to be waiting for 2+ hours between transfers. This part of the state is really not well connected as far as public transportation goes. \n\nHave you looked into the Zipcars on campus?",

We do get free public transit with our student id's, so that's something. My bet is with public transportation you can effectively double any drive time in the Monterey Area. Make friends, offer to split gas, buy them a drink, something. You're going to want access to a car.",

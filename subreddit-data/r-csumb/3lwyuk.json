Within ISSM I changed my \"combined majors\" many times as well before settling on TAT + GS. \n\nChanging majors a lot teaches you a ton about how the system at csumb works and what specifically you need to graduate without any help from counsellors. It's useful to know your way in and out of the catalog and know your catalog rights and timings of all the classes. \n\nI changed majors because I realized I wanted to do something bigger than just get a college degree because I quickly learned a college degree is a dime a dozen in the working world - so I went for something unique. \n\nIn my everyday life - post college - I'm able to really see the connections between everything. I work in a non-related (science) company. And I'm able to improve the business because I can critically think about and solve systemic problems (an ability I gained from SBS and GS) as well as produce top notch media content for a small company.

We helped the IT dept orchestrate the transition from this archaic email system to the gmail accounts we now have for instance. We also engaged a bit more with the campus and tried to hold the admins accountable to the original Csumb master plan ...\n\nBut of course over time our influence wained as people graduated without passing on their knowledge and skills - so the coffee shop in the library became a peets coffee instead of the student voted sustainable green mountain brewing company. (And The student center coffee place became Starbucks despite our vehement opposition to that wretched corporation) \n\n\"ording\" was akin to freshman \"dis\"-orientation.. Including a trip to the bunker on the beach and a massive jungle juice infused day on the beach thrown by upper class men for the freshman on the first sunny day of the semester. By the time I left campus last year, most of the very cool art-infested abandoned buildings were demolished and nobody threw the big disorientations. Ording is a dying art.\n\nOttermedia was once the most insane progressive alternative nonsense in the area - now it's almost dead due to the admins booting the main guy who put his life into it - all for the sake of homogenization.\n\nI guess overall csumb lost its real student culture since I've been there. It's now white-washed sponsored AS events with their nonsense homecoming shit. Give me another NoiseArt music fest at the BBC - there was like 15 bands from across the state there. Now there's nothing and it's impossible for anyone to throw events there without miles of red tape. \n\nHaha I should stop ..\nPs the piano tree was THE smoking spot \n",

They treated me fairly in deciding my probation, but there was no infrastructure for getting me back on campus when it ended. So, I spent 2010 through 2013 living off campus in PG, Monterey, Seaside. Some thoughts:\n\nDon't live in Monterey. I found places that cost the same as Seaside places. Not worth it. The commute to campus is 30 minutes as opposed to 10 minutes. Awesome place to live and work, but the commute killed me on late classes. Salinas has a similar commute to Monterey's, but costs less. \n\nI found places off campus exclusively through Craigslist. Seemed creepy at first, but everyone I interacted with was cordial. Lived with some workers from the Aquarium, some local musicians/car mechanics, other CSUMB students, some NPS or Language Institute students. I checked out some families that were renting an extra room, but I didn't dig living with a family. Apparently prices have gone up since I've left, but I haven't kept up with it. After a few weeks of searching, rent ended up being $525 to $600 per month directly to homeowners. \n\nUnless you already have a circle of friends at CSUMB, living off campus means that you will have to struggle a lot to find friends at CSUMB. Most social life and studying takes place on campus. Being off campus makes you an outsider. ",

But it is cozy. It\u2019s just a totally different vibe. I was drawn to it. The area is beautiful! There is a lot to do, just not as much as we get used to living in LA / SD. It\u2019s a change for sure, but can be a good one.",

            "comment": "I am a transfer student as well! I graduate in two weeks but I can def help you out.\n\nMonterey is a quiet little place. Definitely different if you\u2019re used to the city. I moved from San Jose which is a huge city about an hour from campus and the nightlife is almost nonexistent in Monterey. There\u2019s a couple of bars but mostly old people go there and there\u2019s hardly any good food options in area as well. I usually just went home on the weekends to party and to eat good food. Despite all of this, my experience at CSUMB was amazing. You live five minutes (driving) from the beach. Class sizes are small so class discussions are fun and engaging. You have the opportunity to become close with professors as well. Because it\u2019s such a small school, you will see the same people in your major classes and I consider this a pro rather than a con because tour get really comfortable with these people and it\u2019s like we\u2019re all in the same boat! The library is comfortable and cozy, perfect place to relax or to study. Everyone on campus is pretty liberal and pro LGTB so you don\u2019t have to worry about Chad saying something problematic haha. \n\nLet me know if you have any more questions.",

I am scared that I will not meet lots of people which i really need to do since I dont know shit about CSUMB. Are there parties? how was your housing experience..ive gathered that it is cheaper to live on campus like promentory apartments? thoughts? thank youuu",

And like I said in my post, you see the same people in your major classes over and over again so I usually became friends with them because of that. But unfortunately, CSUMB is a really quiet campus so meeting people is kinda 50/50, you really gotta put yourself out there and join a club or don't be shy talking to your classmates! \n\nThere are some parties but honestly, not really. They usually happen on East Campus if there is any. My housing experience was awesome! I lived in Avocet which is a dorm hall on campus. You have to share a kitchen and fridge with your entire building but my roommate and I usually just ate in the dining hall or other place on campus since you are required to get a meal plan when. you live in the dorms. I loved living close to my classes honestly. It's way cheaper than living in Prom. But if you don't mind a walk, then you'll be fine in Prom. I was supposed to live in Prom but they got filled up really fast and I was initially really disappointed but then I ended getting a really cool roommate at my dorms and I had an awesome experience living there.",

            "comment": "Hi! I\u2019m thinking of transferring in the fall. I\u2019m from LA/LB area so I was worried the town would be too sleepy for me. I went to visit in early March and let me tell you there was nothing going on at night. They honestly were taking COVID a lot more seriously than where I\u2019m from though and after listening to local residents, it seems like the Main Street bar scene was very pleasant pre-pandemic. There\u2019s a big marine bio community out there and the people all seem very respectful to the nature/ocean around. Overall it seems like a cool town with a lot of daytime activities. Nature and conservation is a priority for them and things are definitely a little slower than LA or SD. Weather is breezy and chillier than SD and it\u2019s a pretty dog friendly area.",

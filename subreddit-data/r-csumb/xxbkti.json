They were upping rent for everyone with no reason. Only through multiple conference room protests did they grandfather existing renters. I had 2 new roommates move into the larger room and each of them had to pay more than I did with a room to myself.\n\nAll this while myself or my guests would get ticketed in my own driveway for having a car tire hang 1\" into sand.",

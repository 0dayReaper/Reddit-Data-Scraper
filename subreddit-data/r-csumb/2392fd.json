    "postText": "Forgive the intrusion dear csumb redditors, but I was wondering if anyone could maybe point me in the direction of any spare Graduation tickets for the spring graduation next month. Unfortunately, my girlfriend was only allotted 2 tickets for graduation because her account was on hold due to problems with financial aid. So basically, she needs 2 more tickets to cover her family. In a perfect world we'd find 3 so I could attend as well, but I want to focus on her family first. So if you know any friends with tickets to spare, please point me in their direction so I may pester them for their tickets.\n\nWe've already tried the facebook page and there's been no luck so far.\n\nThanks guys.\n ",

I'd call in and they just kept pushing back the date when the info would go out. Sucks, but I guess that's just how it is. I'd try to not worry about it as you'll probably be put in either your first or second choice, but it's definitely anxiety-inducing to not know if you have housing or not until right before the semester starts.

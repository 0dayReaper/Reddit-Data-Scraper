Something like MS to psychology would be a greater shift in mindset IMO, as you can expect a lot more academic reading and writing. My friends that do psych tend to do research that's very community based, so you can bet that you'll be talking to people a lot.  \n  \nOverall you do you homie I love you",

Im taking precalc for the 5th time and im just realizing I can take a major that uses what im good at, writing essays, reading, analyzing, instead of numbers, which im horrible at. Ive been forcing myself to learn math this whole time instead of what im actually good at. Im an idiot lmao",

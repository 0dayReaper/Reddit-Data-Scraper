    "postText": "Hi y'all! I'm transferring this Fall. I have over 60 units and thought the Promontory was my only real option. I wish there was an unfurnished option.   \n\n\nI see that North Quad is available if one chooses the Living Learning Community for Internationally Inclined Students. I'm 28, turning 29 in February. I fit in okay with my 20something peers at my community college, but I think I'll stick out in North Quad. Anyone have any insight?  \n\n\nEast Campus seems a bit too far... I technically qualify with 93 units but is it just for families? Who fits in well on East Campus?  \n\n\nIf anyone has input about the Promontory, I'd love to hear it as that seems like the most likely option. Do we need a meal plan? I don't think so?",

You don't need a meal plan each of those places has a kitchen. If you drive to school or have a bike maybe East Campus is the best choice since it is a lot cheaper. Last I checked anyways lol",

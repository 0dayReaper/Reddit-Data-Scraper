I\u2019m an incoming transfer and wasn\u2019t sure how the school was set up during the pandemic, but I\u2019m assuming this won\u2019t be effected since it\u2019s detached from the physical campus. TIA :-)",

But at most there might be a chance of just having the first few weeks online like the UC\u2019s are planning.",

(Although the policy might have changed, I graduated in the spring of last year)\n\nAlso the land between east campus and main campus is still technically CSUMB, just no buildings lol",

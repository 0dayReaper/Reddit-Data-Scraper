I have lots of extra discs and its the most fun you can have on our isolated campus! Women are more than welcome because we are trying to establish a Women's club, but no worries no commitment! I play with my girlfriend most times so it would be fun to get more women into it. ",

My college had a course and I loved it, cause everyone was really chill and didn't care if you were playing slow or slugging beers",

    "postText": "Hello!\n\nHaving had a few years previously of ASL classes I am planning to start with 102 in the spring, however since it has been awhile since I last took a class I am hoping to spend the fall reviewing in the meantime. I was wondering if anyone could share any information about the textbooks (if any) that are used in the 101 class typically or previously so I can try to use it to review.\n\nThank you!",

    "postText": "Around like 9:45 last night my Discord stopped working on both my computer and phone. Messages won't send and will be lost in limbo. Tried logging out and it wouldn't let me in at all.\n\nDisconnected from the wifi on my phone after a power cycle and it could connect and log in and work as normal. Connected back to wifi and it couldn't. I imagine the same would work for my computer if I did the same.\n\nThis seems like a CSUMB issue and not a discord issue? Anyone else having this problem?",

    "postText": "I recently visited the new student union building and was hesitant/confused as to how these are supposed to function. Whenever I've seen these \"All gender bathrooms\" at business's they usually tend to be single-use bathrooms, but when I entered the ones on campus they had multiple urinals and stalls to use. I'm not sure how to frame the question, but should I just ignore the women or the XYZ gender and just blow up last night's posole without worrying/caring who's sitting in the stall next to me?",

            "comment": "I haven't seen how the bathrooms are set up in the student union building but I felt that the all gender ones at the arts and humanities building were really nice because each of the stalls were basically the same as being inside of a room to yourself.  I remember the doors and walls to the stalls being pretty much from floor to ceiling and very little sound could get through so I honestly would have no idea if there was even a person in the stall next to me.  The only real downside I saw with those bathrooms was that there were fewer stalls and it could get a larger line during the busier times.",

I saw how nice they really were and how private each stall is. It feels like I\u2019m in a fancy smancy bathroom haha. So my advice is just go in and do what you gotta do. Get in and get out. Also you shouldn\u2019t care either who\u2019s sitting next to you, we all go to the bathroom! Just use your bathroom etiquette and you\u2019re good.",

No lurking, peeping, staring/glaring etc. Go in - do your business like you expect anyone else to, and get out. \n\nAs a cis woman- it\u2019s not like I walk in to a gender neutral restroom and hang out by the urinals for a quick banter, nor am I the least bit interested in other peoples business while they and I am in there.\n\nPs. This type of restrooms are fairly common in (northern) Europe. Don\u2019t know where you are-but fair warning if you\u2019re not from Europe and want to travel here some day.",

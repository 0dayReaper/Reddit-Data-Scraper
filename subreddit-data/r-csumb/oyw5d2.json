            "comment": "Hey there. I went to CSUMB from 2004-2011 and here are some suggestions. Cafes and restaurants on campus. Dining commons as well but I would rather work at the Starbucks or Otter Bay Cafe or Pete\u2019s coffee in the library. I worked at ASAP as a tutor for a couple years because I\u2019m good with Microsoft Excel but maybe not a great job for a freshman unless you do scheduling or reception for ASAP (the tutoring center). There are student academic advising jobs as well. Campus service center has jobs for students. I believe there is an office on campus that will find you a job somewhere on campus. You are almost guaranteed to get a job somewhere. Some are literally sitting at a desk at an entrance to a building doing almost nothing so you can do homework or whatever while you \u201cwork\u201d. You can be a residential advisor too if you live in the dorms, I think you get free rent and meal plan and they pay you a small amount but you can\u2019t be a freshman normally and you\u2019re basically a babysitter for freshman and sophomores.\n\nIf you have questions let me know, but like I said either go online to the website or call the service center and they will be able to point you in the right direction. I can almost guarantee you get some kind of an on-campus job.",

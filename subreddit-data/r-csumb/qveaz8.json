My current major is kinesiology, but I have found a new interest in computer science, I have an appointment with one of the computer science staff, but I just wanted to ask y'all! So how is the major? What is it like? Workload(homework, projects, and etc)? Any advice or feedback is much appreciated. I appreciate you taking the time reading this, much love! \ud83c\udf43",

            "comment": "IDK if the majors are still the same but I did Information Technology and Communication Design.  I learned a bit of everything, computer architecture, some c++ programming, unix, but spent the most time doing computer networking classes.  To me they were the most fun and had cool labs and get more advanced the further you go.  There were some group projects but all of the IT classes I took had very little homework.  I went on to being a desktop tech and then systems administrator, and the unix/networking classes really helped me understand how things worked.\n\nAll of the time consuming homework I had was for writing classes (HCOM?) and math.\n\nWhat about the major interests you, programming? networking?  I never used C++ again after taking the classes, but I learned bash scripting and python on my own and really enjoy it.  If I were interested in being a developer I would have learned Java.",

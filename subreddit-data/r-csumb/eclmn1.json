            "comment": "I'm not a math major personally, but csumb's math department seems pretty solid. It seems pretty well funded, with a fairly substantial wing in the Associated Science Building.\n\nI transferred in for this semester, and applied for housing in early July, but didn't get placed until weeks after orientation, but ended up in East Campus. Main campus filled up fairly fast from what I hear. Currently there are 3 main parking lots near the center of campus (first come first serve) and each of those usually have a fair number of reserved motorcycle spaces.\n\nHonestly I like the school. I'm going for my BSBA. But just make sure you know what you're expecting when you come here. Parties rarely happen, athletics are cool, but there is no school spirit here from what I can tell. Personally not a problem as I don't usually find myself interested in the events they are hosting. Class size is surprisingly manageable, so don't expect to be one of three hundred faces in a lecture hall. Odds are your professor has maybe 100-150 students across their various classes.",

The class size is what I'm ideally looking for, I've never been a fan of large auditoriums or classes so that's good to hear. My GPA is in the mid 2.5 and I'm wondering if thatll be an issue. I messed around with another major and realized it wasnt for me",

I need my student ID for the east campus housing document in order to move in this fall.  I looked all over the dashboard, oasis, canvas, and ilearn but couldn't find it.",

The advice I was given by one of the financial aid ladies was to save it as a contact in your phone! Or you can memorize it because it has come up a few times when I was on campus. My partner is one of those people who has his license plate, license number, student ID and stuff memorized I personally can\u2019t get on that level but I admit, it\u2019s a good idea!",

    "postText": "I will be starting at CSUMB soon and I'm looking for some advice. \n\nI'm planning on putting together a pretty giant Tips, Tricks, Advice, Useful links, etc... post that I will reference later, and if anyone else finds it useful they can too. So I'm trying to gather as much info as I can. \n\nAfter a few semesters of Electrical and Computer Engineering I've decided to change majors to Computer Science.\n\n***\n\n###I'm looking for some tips on starting out:\n* Are there any good materials, that I should keep a reference to?\n* Do you know of any good books I should read, outside of the assigned ones. \n* Is there anything you wish you knew going in, that you know now?\n* Are they any cool projects I should look into doing for my later years in the field?\n*  Any great \"Aha!\" moments that you remember?\n* Anything to look out for in a teacher? Good or bad.\n* Any good hardware, or software to invest in?\n* Do you have anything that you couldn't live without?\n* Are there any good communities to stay active in, post questions, learn from, etc. (including subreddits ^.^)\n* Any good study tips?\n* Any good partner majors, that compliment computer science, worth looking into?\n* Anything else you can think of!\n \nThat's just a general list, if you think of anything that you think might be helpful, please post it I'd really appreciate it :) \n\n***\n\nI'm really looking for anything I can get my hands on as of now. Class just started and I'm pretty pumped to get going. \n\nThanks for anything you provide! I'm looking forward to reading it.\n\n***\n\n***\n\nI decided that it might make it easier to respond if I take all of the questions, and put them in a easily copy-pasted format. Use this if you want. :) I made this format using a response from /u/v11che in my other thread. After seeing his response, I figured I could have saved him some time, and might some other people time by making this.\n\n\n    **Are there any good materials, that I should keep a reference to?**\n\n    &lt;Response Here&gt;\n\n    **Do you know of any good books I should read, outside of the assigned ones?**\n\n    &lt;Response Here&gt;\n\n    **Is there anything you wish you knew going in, that you know now?**\n\n    &lt;Response Here&gt;\n\n    **Are they any cool projects I should look into doing for my later years in the field?**\n\n    &lt;Response Here&gt;\n\n    **Any great \"Aha!\" moments that you remember?**\n\n    &lt;Response Here&gt;\n\n    **Anything to look out for in a teacher?

That way you can possibly setup your last semesters to be your capstone, final projects, and easy GE courses.",

There are a lot of resources available like the TAs, anyone hanging out in the lab, and even the teachers will help you out outside of class. Always do your coding homework, its a lot like Math in that if you take the time to do your homework thoroughly, the exams/quizzes are a breeze. If you really want to be successful, at least from what I've witnessed, the students that also did side projects for themselves always got great job offers at the time of graduation.",

For instance try and be thorough for each and every project you do with classes, especially making demo projects. At the end of a graduate's study they will have a large quantity of projects to go into a portfolio. I was talking to some of the department heads , and they were explaining that most (all) graduates have a job set up in their respected field and are working within a week of graduation. So all in all try and make a good contact network while managing your studies, kinda common sense, but it has a huge payoff (especially for CS). ",

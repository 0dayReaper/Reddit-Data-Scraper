Idk pure sq footage tho. Rooms in Prom are a tiny bit smaller but you get your own bathroom. Idk how those bathrooms are. Sharing my bathroom in East campus isn\u2019t the end of the world but it does suck if somebody is showering and you need it. East campus parking permit is free. Idk about prom parking. I really enjoy living in east campus bc I like biking to class. \n\nTLDR: they\u2019re similar in terms of size but I prefer east campus. I\u2019ve seen prom and it\u2019s fine.",

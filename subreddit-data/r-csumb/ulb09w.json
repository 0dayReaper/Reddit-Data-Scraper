CSUMB at the lower end of the resource chain for the CSU just better exemplifies some of the systemic problems.",

I net $21/hr as an instructor at CSUMB. My partner who worked in a restaurant as a prep cook made more than I do. I make close to the average pay of a 7-Eleven assistant manager or a Starbucks shift leader. It is what some migrant agricultural workers are currently making.\u201d",

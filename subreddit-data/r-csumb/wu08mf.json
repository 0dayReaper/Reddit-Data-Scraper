I\u2019ve heard Monterey is a bit of a boring place with not much to do for younger people. I have a few questions to ask so please give your honest answers\n\n1. Is there much to do in Monterey and the general area for young people? \n2. What\u2019s the party life like?\n3. What\u2019s the campus like and is it overall a good place to learn? \n4. Hows the on campus living arrangements?\n\nAppreciate any help xx",

            "comment": "I did an exchange there in 2019 so some of my info may be outdated now. My gf was doing an exchange at SJSU at the same time I was at CSUMB, so I was back and forth between the two every weekend and able to compare.\n\n1. Monterey is a lovely town, but it's quite small. There are things to do but not endless options.\n2. It's ok, but I mainly went to parties in SJ so may not be the best person to answer this.\n3. The campus is very spread out. I relied a lot on Lime scooters when I was there but I believe they have since been removed.\nI had a great experience in my classes and the quality of my course was definitely the best part of studying there, but this varies by subject. \nBear in mind CSUMB is not IN Monterey, it's near Marina, but if you don't have a car you will really struggle to get around, and you will spend a fortune on ubers. When I was researching which college to do my exchange to, I didn't realise quite how isolated the campus was. Your student ID gets you free bus rides, but they come only once an hour and take ages to get anywhere. The area is beautiful, you're about a 40 minute walk from the beach and the sunsets are incredible.  \n4. Some good options, I lived at Promontory which was nice. \n\nI think if I wasn't at SJSU regularly when I was there, I might have enjoyed CSUMB a bit more, but as I was often around a proper city college I could clearly see how much I was missing out on. On the other hand, if I wasn't in SJ every weekend I may have been a lot more bored overall! \n\nThis was obviously my personal experience as an exchange there - I'm really glad I did it but if you're used to city based universities this is a huge difference.",

            "comment": "I also did an exchange there in 2019 and tought I'd share my experience:\n\n1. The area has very nice beaches which are great for swimming or hanging out with friends. Monterey itself is quite beautiful but small and there is not a big nightlife, just a couple of bars and restaurants to go to.\n2. Not crazy when I was there, but there were quite a few house parties which were great. If you go there as an exchange student it will be easy for you to meet other internationals to have great parties with :)\n3. The campus is good. That its more spread out was never an issue for me. But I don't mind walking a bit ;) The library is a nice place to study, I went there almost every day.\n4. I was living in Promontory as well. I liked that they have a small gym there and a room to play pool. Best option on campus if you ask me.",

            "comment": "Came back from an exchange a few months ago, and it was amazing, way better than I expected.\n\n1. There\u2019s some bars in Monterey but I didn\u2019t really go to them, it\u2019s more a wholesome day place than a night out place tbh\n\n2. It\u2019s not a party uni, and you\u2019re not going to get those big frat parties you see in films. There are a lot more house/flat parties than I expected though. Wednesday to Saturday you can pretty much always find a few things going on. Other internationals seemed to party the most, but ofc Americans would always join. We also had forest parties which the police were chill with, but I think they got shut down eventually. Might restart though. Spring break is also a great opportunity for a road trip to a proper party place. Rosarito, sand Diego and lake havasu are pretty easy to get to, or you could fly somewhere.\n\n3. Campus is really nice. Small and not as advanced as my home uni, but I go to one of the biggest in the UK so not that surprising. Weathers decent but do bring jumpers, it can get cold. The beach is in walking distance and it\u2019s a great place to have some drinks (not technically legal but never had issues with police).\nMost of the internationals and I found the work pretty easy, but that doesn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t a lot to do, and working that into travelling can end up being kinda intense. Ended up being a great grade boost though, and if grades don\u2019t count for you I\u2019d definitely prioritise exploring as much  as possible. You\u2019re in a great location to go up to Yosemite and San Fran, or down to LA, Las Vegas and San Diego \n\n4. Promontory\u2019s the nicest and a good location, but it\u2019s expensive. East campus is really nice too, but it\u2019s off campus and quite spread out. For me it was a 10 min cycle/35 min walk, but if you were at the other end it\u2019d be a trek. The shuttle to main campus was shit and unreliable, might improve though I think it got a lot of complaints. North quad is decent too, but depends whether you\u2019d rather cook; dining commons has got better but it\u2019s not the best. Sharing a rooms not super fun either but you get over it. \n\nPublic transport in general is quite bad. I ended up buying a cheap car and selling it at the end, and I\u2019m so glad I did, it opened up so much. Even if you wait a couple of months in I\u2019d still say it\u2019s worth it, cheaper than all the hiring you\u2019d do otherwise. You could even split the cost with friends. \n\nLmk if you have any other questions, and feel free to message later if u need help buying a car or anything xx",

            "comment": "I didn\u2019t go to cusmb but I live in the area.  There is great outdoors stuff to do around the Monterey peninsula, good surfing, and hiking. Cusmb was built on a decommissioned military base that has fun hiking and mountain biking trails.  There is a climbing gym near campus. Also, Monterey just got got a professional soccer team that plays at the stadium on campus. I agree with the above comment that public transportation isn\u2019t great, but the area is fun. There are lots of diverse and interesting food options near Monterey and Santa Cruz isn\u2019t that far away, Santa Cruz has fun nightlife good live music venues some world class surfing  and lots of young folks\nEdit: typo and added some more info",

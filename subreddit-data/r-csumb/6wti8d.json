    "postText": "Suicide Prevention Service is seeking volunteer responders for our 24-hour Suicide Crisis Line. In the past 5 years, over 400 Central Coast residents have died from suicide.  While the problem is very real, prevention is possible and powerful.  Through training, volunteers learn how to connect with, listen to and support someone who is suicidal in staying safe. Volunteers who answer the phone say that the experience has changed their lives forever.\n\nVolunteer training begins on Thursday, October 12th 2017 and no prior experience is necessary.  To join our community of dedicated and caring responders, please call (831) 459-9373 x2 or visit us online at www.suicidepreventionservice.org\n\nFlyer Link: https://i.imgur.com/EiKyHYy.png",

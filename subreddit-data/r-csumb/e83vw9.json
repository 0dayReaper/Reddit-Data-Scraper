The only class worth it is cst412 pretty fun but you don\u2019t get ccna or literally any networking standard. Cst311 was bogus cst312 was dank when Pablo breuer was teaching it but it\u2019s gone downhill sadly no one says it\u2019s an awesome class anymore",

I\u2019m in it and it\u2019s pretty great imo.",

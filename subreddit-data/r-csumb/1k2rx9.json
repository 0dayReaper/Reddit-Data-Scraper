Didn't think about it until my girlfriend mentioned having uneasy feelings there, but do you guys think it might be haunted? The only things I've found out are what the map says. There was a building there when Ft. Ord existed. And something about 34708/4768 and IAO for DPTM. Maybe a brigade number? Or is this just something not even worth looking into further?",

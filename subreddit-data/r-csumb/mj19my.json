    "postText": "Hi all. I\u2019m up here near CSUMB.  (I\u2019m an admitted prospective Freshman for fall 2021), staying for the weekend visiting from LA and trying to narrow down my college choices so I can commit to one. I\u2019ve heard so many mixed opinions about CSUMB, that before I came into town, I was really leaning towards UCSB (admitted) and thought I\u2019d fall in love with the UCSC campus (waitlisted). But actually, from what I\u2019ve seen so far, the size/location and campus environment at CSUMB might actually be the best fit for me. I\u2019m interested to hear from others what the love and or hate about the school. I\u2019m also very interested to hear if you think the academics are strong in biology/marine biology?  Compared to UCSB? Any regrets?",

I have a close friend who goes to UCSB and loves it, but it is a very different experience for sure. UCSB has much larger classes and has a more prestigious reputation. CSUMB has smaller class sizes, many opportunities for internships/research (look into UROC!) and definitely a less active social life than UCSB. The social life at CSUMB is definitely pretty chill compared to UCSB. I am not a marine science or biology major (I\u2019m environmental studies), but I believe both of those majors are pretty strong and there are amazing connections to the local area (Monterey Bay Aquarium, MBARI, Bureau of Land Management, and so many more). Best of luck in your decision and I hope that helps.",

They\u2019ve been building new buildings, but there are still some old ones. It\u2019s pretty rad to go to school in a town that people come for vacation. I transferred in fall 2019 and graduate next month and don\u2019t regret my decision to enroll here.",

I love Monterey and I love the small classes but there just isn\u2019t a comparison at all. I would not recommend choosing CSUMB over UCSB if you can afford the tuition. Also think about how much more competitive you\u2019ll be in the workforce or for grad school. Best of luck ! :)",

I really didn\u2019t like the social scene in high school and am afraid that I\u2019d struggle socially in a big school like UCSB. I\u2019m a quiet girl that loves nature and gets stressed out in a highly competitive academic environment and am not big into the party scene. Of course, I want to make friends and develop relationships with peers. I just need to find my tribe.",

Incomparably beautiful environment, a walk away from the beach or the fort ord trails which are beautiful and right next to campus.\n\nIt's a small, somewhat quiet campus. Not too much going on at any one time. It's easy for most to find a small group to fit in with, and it's very peaceful. After attending for 2 years, my favorite things about campus are how laid back it is, how environmentally friendly it is and how beautiful the area is.\n\nIn terms of UCSB, I think it's too crowded there personally. The area is nice but I don't appreciate the vibe of the people I get there, I have a few friends who go there and I visit whenever I get a chance. It's better to go for a couple days or a week as a vacation, but I could never live there.\n\nEdit: My experience at CSUMB is tailored extremely to my lifestyle and my goals, so take it with a grain of salt. I'm a big environmental advocate, a hippy and a wannabe musician. I will also say that the classes at CSUMB are good but they aren't the best college courses you can find. I'm an ENSTU major and love it but other friends in different majors don't enjoy their classes.\n\nAt CSUMB though there are amazing extra credentials that are very fun. Surfing, Diving, Disc Golf, Biking. Tons of QoL things to do that make living there more fun.",

Sure go with CSUMB but know you should expect to put a bit more effort into your social life. I got accepted into UCR but I rejected it to go to CSUMB for the CS++ program (I'm a CS major) because I thought it'd be a safer career choice. I'm a freshman but it's still paying off as I already have a pretty solid internship coming up this summer. My first year being online would have made making friends more difficult but I made a discord for my cohort program and literally everyone joined it and much of us are friends now. There are plenty of discords for school programs, departments, and clubs, just have to know how to find them. So I got pretty lucky in terms of social life too. So far what I regret is the housing availability.",

Please.  \n\nI choose to go to CSUMB over a UC that's comparable to UCSB and it was a terrible decision that caused me an indescribable amount of stress. \n\nI went from CSUMB to a UC law school.  But it was HARD.  I had to have one of the highest GPAs at CSUMB, I had to out work nearly everyone there, and I had to have some insane extra curriculars.  Out of the 5 pre law people that I knew at CSUMB, I am the only one that was admitted to a T50 law school (hell I was the only one admitted to a T150 law school). \n\nI remember joking around with my law school class mates that it was easier in law school than it was in college.  Going to CSUMB put me so far behind professionally that I needed to work 60+  hour weeks my entire senior year just to catch up to where I would have been naturally at a UC.    \n\nI cried when I got back into the UC system.\n\nGraduating from a UC will make it FAR easier to find a job.  If you come to CSUMB and you want your degree to mean anything, you will need to outwork EVERYONE here. \n\n------------------\n\nI was a shy kid too.  I changed DRASTICALLY my first year of college.  It's strange, when you leave home, you get the leave behind all of the baggage of your childhood and it becomes easy to open up.  I wouldn't worry about not feeling social enough for a campus.     \n\nCollege is about getting a job.  \n\nPick the college that will best get you the job you want.  And the UC system just simply does a better job at getting you into the job you want, than the CSU system does.",

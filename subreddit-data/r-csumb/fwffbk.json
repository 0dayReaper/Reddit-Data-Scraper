AS is running this form to get feedback on offering a credit/no credit term, they didn't offer much else information but there are spots to add in concerns/question in the [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQtKKI4TwQNvlmW4DJ5qiMVtcu3c9oZEVi0zTnbTtA7BhVMA/viewform) .\n\n I think considering with everything going on this might help folks out but there are a lot of questions on the logistics of it ... what do you guys think ?",

I\u2019ve been hearing rumors about Credit/No Credit and Pass/Fail grading, but I\u2019m still kind of confused.\n\nWould it be easier to pass with this system than it is with getting a letter grade? If you don\u2019t get credit, how much does it hurt you in comparison to failing grade (or is it the same)? I\u2019m just wondering how this can impact folks",

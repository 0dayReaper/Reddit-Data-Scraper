    "postText": "I am transferring with an ADT in Business Administration. I have only taken statistics but per CSUMB\u2019s website I see that finite math is a requirement to graduate for business even if you have and ADT. Should I take it right now at community college or should I just take it at csumb. Anybody know if it\u2019s an easy class at csumb? So far in cc I\u2019ve hard that it\u2019s either easy or hard. I got a B in stats which I didn\u2019t find to be hard just for a reference.",

The math doesn't go above basic math functions BUT the whole class consists of word problems introducing business terms. All of the things you learn is 100% used in higher business courses. If you ask for help when needed there shouldn't be a problem of succeeding in this class. \n\n\nP.s. had a friend write this",

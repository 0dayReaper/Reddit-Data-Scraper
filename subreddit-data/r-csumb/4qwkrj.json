    "postText": "So, I will be starting my first semester at CSUMB in the Fall (transferring in as a CS major). I'm currently living in San Jose, and am not looking forward to the commute, at all.\n\nI live with my girlfriend, and our 2 small dogs. Does anyone know of a reasonably priced apartment complex near campus that would accommodate me?\n\nThere are a few posted on the housing section of CSUMBs Dashboard, but they are all booked/ not responding.",

The pics on the website are for the newer developments. You wanna check out the older developments. Alliance I think is the other company that runs stuff around here. Anyways it's close to Csumb (within commutable biking Distance) and fairly inexpensive if you have a roommate or two. Pets are fine too. Other than that Craigslist seaside marina are your best bets. Or commute from salinas. ",

It might be too late to apply but you can look at the apartment complexes right next to the dunes shopping center. Those apartments are right next to the school so you could even walk across the street and you will be on campus.",

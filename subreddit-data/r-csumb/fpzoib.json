I just got an acceptance into CSUMB/MLML for a Masters and wanted to ask if anyone could give me an idea of what on-campus/off-campus housing is like, what's around to do in the area (assuming we all get lifted from Stay At Home order at some point), and any hidden fees you recall.",

It's not really a dorm, it's basically a 5 star hotel. \n\nDon't bother with Promontory it's not worth the debt. \n\nEast campus is the real deal. $580 to share an unfinished room with somebody. Your going to have to bring your own router. \n\nI just moved out of east campus back to my mom's house (Fucking Coronavirus ruined everything)\n\nAfter only living there 2 semesters, I can safely tell you, it is not only cheap, but amazing. The garage space is ample, and if you don't have a car, the busses come every 15 minutes. \n\nThe campus is great. Keep a windbreaker on you at all time because the weather is iffy, one minute it's blistering hot, and the next it's foggy and your freezing.\n\nA lot of people talk shit about CSUMB and that it's not the best. Don't listen to them. Unless your going to Ivy league, prestige is not worth the debt. Also, Don't bother with the dining commons, the food is overpriced, salty and subpar. \n\nAnd with that I must say welcome to CSUMB, your going to love it here.",

I prefer cooking my own meals anyways.\n\nDo you remember any hidden fees that can't be found on the costs and aid page on the CSUMB website or is it all pretty upfront?",

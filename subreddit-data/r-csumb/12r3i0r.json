    "postText": "I'm transferring in so I'm not a double major yet (for transfer credit requirements) but I do have a pretty set mindset about double majoring when I get there. I went to otter day and asked about it, and if it was common / how it looked like for senior projects/thesis. Everyone blew it off, tried to discourage me, or said it was \"too hard\" or seemingly unattainable. So my question is, are any of you double-majoring/  know someone who is? Just want to make sure that they don't let you do it.\n\nDeciding between here and UCSC. this is my top choice",

            "comment": "Can\u2019t speak on doing a double major, but do know that the CSU system is much more practically focused than the UC system. My best friend transferred to UCSB, I transferred to CSUMB. She has done almost no field or lab work outside of large isolated projects for upper div courses, its much more lecture/theory based, so if you want a PhD UC is without a doubt the way to go. If you want more practical application like field work and observational studies CSU is better. CSU goes into much more depth on things youd actually use (assuming youre a STEM major) like ARCgis/Rstudio/remote sensing etc. \n\nUnless you aren\u2019t planning on getting an advanced degree, I really wouldn\u2019t bother with a double major undergrad. Not to echo what you\u2019ve already heard but its an incredibly amount of work for almost no payoff. Id focus on keeping a 4.0 GPA with a single major and go for a closely related minor instead.",

But that's rare ([Hay its up to 40%](https://csumb.edu/iar/retention-graduation-overview/)).  \n\nA second major USUALLY will not help you professionally except in very tight circumstances.  \n\n----------\n\nAlso, anything in the UC system is better than anything in the CSU system.  Always pick the UC.",

    "postText": "I recently received my Financial Aid award from CSUMB; I'm fairly new to understanding FAFSA, so when I opened the Award Package from Oasis, it gave me an option of accepting the FEDERAL PELL GRANT and/or the SUBSIDIZED DIRECT LOAN. Can someone explain to me the difference please? \n\nI'm trying to graduate without a loan (I will only let it happen for the worst case scenario - but am solely depending on scholarships and my job.) \n\nIf anyone could help me and/or direct me to someone who may be knowledgeable of it that would be amazing! Thank you so much in advance!",

Avoid loans unless absolutely necessary because you\u2019ll end up paying it back (and often with interest).",

This is the best Ed LOAN you can get (obviously not as good as grants and scholarships) so if you run into and major financial emergency see the FA office first. Don\u2019t go to private loans. ]",

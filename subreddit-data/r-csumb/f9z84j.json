    "postText": "Hello veterans/ family members of veterans with GI Bill benefits, I am looking for a program that I can take online using my GI Bill benefits. I know that I need to take one class per semester that is not online but Actually in class, perhaps a hybrid class in order to receive the BAH payments.\n\nI know that CSUMB will not allow me to take a class at the campus while taking the online course but will allow me to finish graduation requirements at a local community college. Has anyone had experience with doing this that could give some pointers on making it all work?\n\nHere\u2019s hoping that my work schedule doesn\u2019t mess with my educational goals too much!",

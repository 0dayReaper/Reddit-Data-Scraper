    "postText": "I am currently only 18 years old and applied to csu mb during fall last year. I want to ask students how the school handles things for freshmen. I am also considering finding a job while studying, is this feasible given the distance to downtown? Are the upper class men usually friendly?  I really love the school and enjoyed the open house, it seems so helpful especially with the small classes. If it matters I am looking at a business major and am from the south bay.",

Downtown Monterey is not that far and the bus fare you already pay for takes you there in about half an hour. \n\nI live off campus with three other upperclassmen. We are all pretty friendly. Typically the most rude and unfriendly people are freshmen. Even then maybe 1/20 people isn't nice. \n\nDid you have any specific questions about what it is like for a freshman?",

Busses can take you for free to Santa Cruz, San Jose, Monterey. \n\nPlenty of people DO stay in their rooms all the times. Plenty of people are out and about on and off campus. \n\nI found living in the dorms to be very enjoyable. The first week/weekend is the most Important week for making friends IMO. Introduce yourself to everyone and talk with everyone. That way you get invited to every event imaginable. Once everyone is settled in it becomes more difficult to meet people.",

I imagine the social life isn't any different than other similarly sized CSUs. When I was a Freshmen most of the people on my dorm floor left their doors open and people would come in and hang out. At the time I wasn't into nightlife so I can't really say much behinds there is a LOT of weed smoking going on. If you are driving, then Monterey is only around 10 minutes away but from what I hear its more focused towards the older crowd. Carmel and Pacific grove aren't much further away.\n\nIf you are into hiking or biking, the Fort Ord National Monument is only around 5 min from campus and has ~80 miles of single track trails and fire roads.

There is a biking club that last semester ran two Ord rides a week with free bike and helmet rentals to students  during the rides.\n As for the weed, its hard to say. I know people who smoked every day and failed plenty of classes and other who smoke and party a lot (not daily) and get straight A's, internships, etc. If you are not into it, then it won't be a problem, if you are then just watch yourself because there will be tons of people willing to smoke.

The campus is large and spread out, so many people were unemployed who didn't have a car (luckily I work remotely in the games industry). The professors I had in the business school were great, but the way that they have the offices setup for the business school is very scattered. My professors didn't really provide any great connections while I was out there, but they did have some interesting background.\n\ntldr; social life sucks, people are poor and unemployed, school is in the middle of nowhere",

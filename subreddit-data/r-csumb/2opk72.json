    "postText": "before I get downvoted into oblivion, let me just say that I would really prefer to work with someone from CSUMB who is ambitious and skilled. I'm a CSUMB graduate and I'd like to provide an opportunity to a student if they're up to the task. \n\nIn a nutshell, if you're a coder with dynamic website building experience, but you're not really design or graphically inclined, this job is for you.\n\nThis job does NOT involve content creation, I will be working closely with you to ensure you have all the content you need, or to generate it myself if needed. \n\nConsider this a portfolio building opportunity at a real local company that sells internationally. \n\nYou MUST be proficient in the following:\n\nHTML, CSS, Javascript, Adobe Business Catalyst\n\nYou MUST be capable of committing at least 10-20hrs a week to start, potentially more depending on your initiative.\n\nOpportunity for this position becoming paid increases dramatically after you can prove that you're proficient in web development. \n\nThank you for your time and consideration",

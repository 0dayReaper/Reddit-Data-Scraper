I personally don\u2019t think the marine science program is competitive at all. The students I have interacted w/ have been very kind. I was applying for the same internship as a couple other students, and we were all excited for one another, no animosity. As long as you\u2019re not dipping below a 2.0 GPA you should be fine! Under the \u201ccollege of science\u201d page on the CSUMB website, there\u2019s a FAQ for CSUMB transfers! Hope this is helpful!",

    "postText": "Hi I'm a transfer student and got accepted into UCSC and CSUMB for fall of 2022. For UCSC I was accepted into the marine biology program. I've heard good things about the program and its faulty but I see a lot of negative things about the school and its administration (bus system, housing, etc.). I want to get a lot of experience and explore doing research. I've heard UCSC offers a lot of opportunities but am wondering if its worth dealing with the negatives? I would most likely live on campus the first year since its guaranteed and so I could get used to the school more. \n\nAs for CSUMB I was accepted into their marine science program, however my only issue with the school is that marine science seems more like learning various technology to study marine ecosystems and not really focused on studying marine animals and their environment which is what I'm more interested in. But I wasn't sure if career wise or grad school wise its better to go broader and study marine science than marine bio. I've also heard good things about the program and I like that the classes are small. Seems like a cool school. But I'm also wondering if going to a small school would not really give me that college experience and feel more like the community college I went to. (I'm not talking about parties)",

            "comment": "Marine biology is not offered at CSUMB, so if that\u2019s what you want a degree in then go to UCSC. Both schools collaborate closely when it comes to research though, and CSUMB does have the advantage of student to faculty ratio. It\u2019s a really small school population wise with only about 8000 students. That\u2019s why I chose CSUMB, but I am also a Bio major not marine bio. The biggest disadvantage that I would say CSUMB has it how small it is and remote/out of the way everything on campus is as it\u2019s really far apart.",

Im also majoring in marine biology, I have read and heard wonderful things about their program throught the years and knew that UCSC was best for me. Another thing that I really took into account was financial aid, CSUMB offered me half of what UCSC did.",

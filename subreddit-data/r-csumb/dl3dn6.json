            "comment": "**Funding:**\n\nYou're only getting paid through UROC, if at all. UROC was very supportive of research in CS and allocated our lab a fair bit of funding for our work, a minimum wage salary, and they covered by East Campus rent from May through September (very cool of them).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CS Department:**\n\nWhen I was doing research (summer 2016), none of the profs got funding and the CS department strongly discouraged extracurricular research/labwork. Furthermore, all of the profs I collaborated with during my time at CSUMB have since moved on to other institutions that were more supportive of their work outside of instruction.  I would not even think doing research is possible without a strong recommendation from a tenured or tenure track faculty member that you're close with. This faculty member could probably be from any department.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day to Day activities:**\n\nMy research was in HCI and we typically read papers and talked about them once a week. We designed an experiment over the summer, applied for ethics approval, and ran some participants, ultimately not publishing at any venues. We had to present what we did at a UROC symposium at the end of the summer. We did publish some other work at international conferences but those were not sponsored by UROC and we paid our own way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bottom line:**\n\nGo for it but don't expect any help from the CS department. Have an adviser in mind before you hit up UROC.",

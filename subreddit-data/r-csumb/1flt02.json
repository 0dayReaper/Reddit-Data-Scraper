Most of the traffic is turning left from Intergarrison onto 8th Avenue to avoid the speed humps on 7th. More than a few times I've seen near misses as people almost rear-end each other when someone has to stop due to oncoming traffic. \n\nI may have to rethink my riding my bicycle to work when they open this. One thing they could do to help would be to put bumps on the right line so you can hear when someone is crossing over onto the bike path from behind. That would be proactive of them and well I've yet to see anything in this area be proactive.",

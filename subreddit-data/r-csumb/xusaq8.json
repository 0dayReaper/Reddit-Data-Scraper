Most students (if not all living here) are now required to pay more than 1200 monthly. Rose from 704 to 1300 this past semester. Absolutely ridiculous. They won\u2019t address it either. Super difficult to communicate with too. Funny how they say \u201cwe care about all our students please let us know if you\u2019re having trouble making rent!!!\u201d Then basically say \u201cjk fuck you figure it out!\u201d When you do email them with concerns. \ud83d\ude44 students have gotten together recently to start a protest and group for it. Hopefully it\u2019ll get through to them.",

And it wasn\u2019t as simple as just sticking them back in place so we couldn\u2019t do it. I lived on campus for 1 1/2 semesters then dipped.",

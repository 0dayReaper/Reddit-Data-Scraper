    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm currently thinking about transferring to Monterey. I go to school at Chico State right now and although it's a fun school, I've drained myself out with the party scene and have became more independent. I'm also a medical student so I do my fair share of studying and partying but chico can be overwhelming at times. I'm over how boring Chico is, since it's in the middle of nowhere and all there is to do is drink. Ive always wanted to live by the beach and since I'm from the Bay Area it's hard for me to live in a little town where everything is 3 hours away from you.  I'm curious as to how Monterey students like the atmosphere of the town and school? I see a lot of posts of how people hated it there and some loved it but it's making my decision difficult. Do people still go out? Is it easy to make friends? Are there lots of things to do like surf (a hobby I'm excited to try) hike, etc? Id be looking into getting an apartment since I've already done the dorm scene. Ive read that CSUMB isn't one of the most amazing schools education wise, which kinda puts a damper on things. But I'm more just looking to be happy with where I live my last 2 years of college. Hopefully there's a diverse amount of opinions to help me make the right decision.",

            "comment": "Ok,\n \nSo deciding to transfer is a pretty big decision. You are going to lose all of your friends that you have in chico and coming into CSUMB as a Jr., I hate to tell you, but it is going to be hard to make new ones. Sure you will meet people in your classes, but it will be on you to be social. \n\nNext, you better make absolutely sure your credits transfer over. I have watched this destroy lives. Don't just trust a counselor because they tell you it will all work out. Email CSUMB and get something signed. \n\nIf you have financial aid, it may not transfer over. Look into whether any scholarships you have will follow you. \n\nOn the surfing point, I know people who do it (Professor Watson did it before class all the time) but know that the water is cold. More people are into SCUBA diving and there is a SCUBA class.  \n\nCSUMB is the cheapest CSU. So if you do not have financial aid, you will likely save money. \n\nThe area is pretty laid back, this isn't for everyone, but if you are partied out, you may like it. \n\nIf you are so keen on getting out of Chico, why not simply study abroad? It will make your life a hell of a lot easier. \n\nI guess you just have to ask yourself if you hate Chico. CSUMB is fine. A solid 6.8/10. If you think Chico is garbage, then transfer. But if you are on the boarder and just looking for a new experience. Uprooting your life and leaving behind all the friends you have made is probably going to back fire. \n",

                    "comment": "I like the advice! Bummer too hear it's not much of a surf town, but anyways. Studying abroad would contradict my major. There aren't many places that offer to study medicine (especially at Chico), and I need to start interning before I apply to grad school. So settling down in the area I live and getting intern hours is where I need to focus. \n\nFriends wise, I'm a pretty social butterfly and I've met a ton of people and made a lot of friendships; but no one that I hangout with or would want to hangout with everyday. I go home a lot on the weekends and hangout with my hometown buddies as well as my girlfriend. That being said I wouldn't be deeply saddened to leave or feel like my life would change much at CSUMB, maybe just a little more independent but a dog can fix that ;) \n\nA lot of it is that I'm bored of the area, I feel like Monterey has more to offer. I just hope it's not too small where I may not meet anyone.",

But I am biased and think traveling can solve any problem. \n\nIf you don't have many friends in Chico, then go for it. If you are serious about transferring though throw a few applications at higher tier schools. Even with a poor SAT, if your college grades are ok it is certainly worth a try. UCLA has a far higher transfer application acceptance rate than general entrance acceptance rate. \n\nAnyways, good luck. ",

I was able to make friends here easily enough. I know Chico is a party school, so if you still want that, this is not the place for you. Partner in one of my classes already told me a bunch of parties got shut down. You need to take3 semesters of a foreign language, and there's only 3 choices, so keep that in mind. There's also a surfing club run by one of the professors (Meghan O'Donell) so that's cool. If there's anything else you want to know, feel free to ask.",

Everyone here has been really friendly and open if you're willing to reach out a little bit!\n3.  It's generally a pretty quiet campus and it tends to be peaceful.  That's not to say that there's nothing happening, it's just that we don't have a lot of noise pollution and events outside all the time.\n4.  Yes people still go out, not like clubbing as much, but they go out to town on weekends and such. Just find the right group.  If you meant like dating, yes we also do that.\n5.  Hiking is nice, surf is okay if you go for a little bit of a drive (I think, I don't really surf), outdoor rec makes sure that there are always events going on, and there are really nice walks.\n6.  North quad (and everything that encompasses) and promontory are apartments, and east campus is made of houses.\n7.  The beach is a 30 min walk away, and I really like it here, but I'm relatively new here too.  (sophomore)",

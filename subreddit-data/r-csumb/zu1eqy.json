Within a couple months at CSUMB they gave food poisoning to many staff and students. That newish. \n\nThe CSU chancellor resigned in disgrace after shielding his protege on the executive staff at CSU Fresno from credible sexual abuse allegations for YEARS well-known to the entire staff. Then when the abuser was forced out, he got a big payout. That was like last spring. \n\nI\u2019ll leave it to others to report whether the culture of non-transparency, unaccountability, and poor communication from the college has changed this fall.",

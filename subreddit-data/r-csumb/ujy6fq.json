    "postText": "So I recently committed to csumb and I\u2019m not gonna lie I\u2019m a little nervous. I\u2019m a transfer student majoring in communication with a concentration in journalism and media studies. I know there are better cal state universities for the major (Fullerton comes to mind) but I ended up choosing csumb because it\u2019s small, affordable, in close proximity to the beach (which in retrospect is kind of a dumb trivial reason to base a college decision on lol) and it\u2019s only a couple hours away from home. Anyways, I just want some encouragement that I made the right decision. I want to know what any of you love about this school. Any clubs, student organizations, or opportunities you\u2019ve gotten from your experience.  Idk, just anything to get me hyped to go here lol.",

A plus in marina sells Marianne's ice cream (a sc brand) cheesecake dreamations sells bitesize cheesecakes, last chance mercantile has all sorts of secondhand treasure.\n\nGotta make the most  of where you end up",

            "comment": "For me I am a Film major (CART) I am always a transfer student from sac state. When I transferred I was expecting much but bro it has been the best experience of my life. Since I transferred I have meet so many people, particularly in my major. I have worked on 4 film sets since 2021. I am meeting new people every day and collaborating. I also am minoring in creative writing which has been awesome cause I recently got my poetry published thanks to my professor. I would say for me the best thing about CSUMB is the people who I made friends with and my professors. Idk if it's different for you major but my professors have been extremely helpful to the point where they even help us get jobs in the industry when we graduate. They want us to succeed always have time available to either talk like friends or just talk about film or talk about what is next. I commute so I don't know much about campus life, but my classes have fun.",

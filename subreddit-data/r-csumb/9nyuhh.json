In the past, we were able to admit those who just had the 3 required courses completed. However, each application cycle is different and just depends on the amount of qualified students we receive. Since you have two of the recommended courses, you would have higher priority than those with just the required courses completed. \n\nYou will need to have received a grade of C or higher in all the prerequisites classes, as well as have an overall GPA of 2.0 and be in good standing from the last school you attended. \n\nThe remaining recommended courses you don't have completed will still need to be completed at a community college before graduation. \n\nI am sorry I can't really give a more straightforward answer since it really just depends on the applicant pool each cycle. I hope this helps! ",

No one will know you attended online unless you tell them, whereas everyone knows WGU is an online school. The only downside is that you have to spend extra time at community college. ",

CSUMB only requires Calculus 2 and I already know my credits will transfer evenly there.\n\nAlso, only WGU and CSUMB will allow me to finish in a reasonable amount of time while taking one class at a time.",

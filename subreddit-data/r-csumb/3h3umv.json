Eventually I brought an unofficial transcript in person when I visited and sent a official one later. I re-sent copies 8 times before my transcript was finally verified. Things happen, but keep records and they will eventually sort things out. \nI finally had my High School mail ME the transcript and I handed it to them in person and asked for a note that it was received.

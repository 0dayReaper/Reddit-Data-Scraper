    "postText": "I currently live in a double on East Campus and really adore both of my roommates. We are all super gung ho to live together again next year, but the girl that's in the double with me is going abroad in fall 2020. She will only be abroad for one semester and would like to live with us in the spring. We have been wondering if it's a possibility for me to live in a double by myself (and pay the single rate for it), so it would just be my other roommate and I for the fall semester, and then the 3 of us all reconvene and live together in the spring. Has anyone worked out an arrangement like this with housing? I know the wording is a bit confusing and it seems a bit unrealistic, but the thought of being stuck with a random 3rd person just for the fall semester is somewhat anxiety inducing.",

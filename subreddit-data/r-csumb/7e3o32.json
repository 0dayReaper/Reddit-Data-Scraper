How are those more beneficial than any of the constituent disciplines?\n\nI don't think you're wrong, just on the fence of whether or not CSUMB is doing this the best way.  Aren't most disciplines becoming interdisciplinary without shoehorning them into a singular program?  ",

Classes like practical computing only serve to make your more employable. ",

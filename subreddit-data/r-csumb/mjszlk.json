He's Macro Eco and stats i believe\n\nProf. Liz Adair was really cool and made shit interesting\n\nI have Shadwin Sharma rn and he's rly good w quick responses to questions n feedback\n\nI'd avoid Martha Iliff, shes very nice but unorganized and ok with not knowing the lesson plan\n\nRate my professor has a lot of reviews too\n\nBe clear with your advisor and take what they tell you. If you don't specify a minor they won't chase after you to declare one.",

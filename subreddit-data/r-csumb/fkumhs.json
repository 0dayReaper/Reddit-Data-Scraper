For some people, CSUMB is safer than home, and they'll be sticking it out for the rest of the semester on campus. If this is you, feel free to comment here and use this thread for support for the next couple of months. Whether it's food, where to find TP, someone to hang out with to stay sane, or homework/class help, feel free to post here.",

Students should utilize the Express Check-Out process. Please understand that the Shelter in Place order has an exception for students returning home from college, so you are allowed to move home.\n\nWe will be working on a prorated refund for your housing and dining plan (if applicable) and there will be no cancellation fees applied. For Main Campus residents, your effective date will typically be based on the date you officially check-out. Students who live on East Campus have until March 31 to check-out or you will be held responsible for April and May rent. To be eligible for a refund, checking-out includes turning in keys, removing your belongings, and cleaning up after yourself. \n\nIt is highly encouraged that you sign up for eREFUNDS (Direct Deposit) and make sure that your student mailing address in OASIS reflects your permanent home address in order to receive your housing refund. Refunds can take up to 6-8 weeks to be received; however, enrolling in eREFUNDS with the university will help ensure that you receive your housing refund in a more timely manner.\n\nResidence halls will remain open and operational with mandated social distancing for students who do not have a safe home to return to at this time. Be advised, CSUMB will continue to provide some form of food service or food service alternative to students remaining on campus; however, students will experience some reduction in terms of venues and/or hours of operation. There may also be some interruptions to mail and package delivery. Additionally, students who remain on campus will be consolidated to apartment-style housing to allow for more social distancing and for the safety and security of the remaining residents.\n\nWe need to know where you are and what plans you are making. Please complete this student status questionnaire. This form will also be used to help determine your refund eligibility. If you want to check out and have a reason you cannot do so by March 23 on Main Campus or by March 31 on East Campus, you must contact Student Housing &amp; Residential Life at student_housing@csumb.edu. \n\nWe know this is a difficult time, stay updated on the COVID-19 situation as it evolves on the CSUMB webpage and from public health agencies, including the CDC.\n\nPlease be in touch.",

They\u2019re not laid off? \nAsking because: \nA man tried to get in my window this morning and left on a golf cart. \nI didn\u2019t call the cops because I saw the golf cart and assumed he worked here. I called east campus office. They\u2019re closed and the lady at main campus just wanted to forward my call to east campus. It didn\u2019t even sound like she gave a single shit that some dude tried to get into my window. That\u2019s my karma for working customer service (food) and not giving a shit about peoples issues. Lol I was in bed and didn\u2019t have a shirt on with a pillow over me&amp;I was like \u201cuhhh hi\u201d *shuts window* &amp;he apologizes a bunch&amp; leaves. I should\u2019ve asked for his name tho.",

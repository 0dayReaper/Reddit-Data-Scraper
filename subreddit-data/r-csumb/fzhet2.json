    "postText": "So I am an incoming transfer student. And plan to live on campus at least for the first year. I am most likely going to East Campus but I know that Promontory will have a Transfer community LLP.  Which was a reason why I considered going there at first. But I plan on going for single occupancy which makes it very expensive. Anyone who has transferred and chose East Campus how was moving there? Any tips for transfer students and resources for the transition.",

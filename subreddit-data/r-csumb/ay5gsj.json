When you do your roommate application just be honest with what you want in a roommate, they're usually pretty good about placing you with people according to your housing profile. \nI'm 23 and am living in North Quad and I thought I was too old for it but it's worked out really well so far!",

I never lived in those but I have a friend that has a single in Tortuga hall and it's just so much closer to everything. That's really my only complaint about it though! ",

It\u2019s bleak and there are no restaurants, grocery stores, etc within walking distance.  I\u2019d suggest living elsewhere like Seaside or Monterey they have a more vibrant community and you don\u2019t have to drive as far to get basic necessities.  ",

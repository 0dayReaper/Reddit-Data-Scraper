There are a few decent places for beginning fun trails close to CSUMB (i.e. Old Coast Road). Would be a fun way to connect with other people and experience all that the area has to offer.",

But since no one else has responded, I just wanted to make sure you were aware of the [Hollister Hills State Vehicular Recreation Area](http://ohv.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=1179).  They are having a [Park Wide Scavenger Hunt](http://ohv.parks.ca.gov/Events/Details/13125) on Sept. 25.  The event will be supported by the [Hollister Hills Off-Road Association](http://www.hhora.org/), which welcomes [new members](http://www.hhora.org/enroll).",

    "postText": "I got accepted to CSUMB :D And i\u2019m considering transferring here after seeing my financial aid package \n\n1. I know this school has a more commuter school environment, how easy is it to make friends? I\u2019m from Central California, so I wouldn\u2019t know anyone at the school. I\u2019m also not a party-person, just don\u2019t want to feel alone \n\n2. I am majoring in Liberal Studies to be an elementary school teacher, how is the program here? \n\n3. Are there many on-campus jobs available? I\u2019d want to get a job, and ideally it would be at the school. \n\n4. How are the dorms? I was looking at the Promontory dorms online and they look nice, are they okay quality? Does social life feel a bit better in the dorms? \n5. Are there a variety of clubs to join? Also, is joining the LLP a good idea / worth it ?\n\n6. Is the school isolated? Are there any grocery stores / cafes / restaurants within walking distance? How walkable is the area in general? (I do not have a car)\n\n7. How safe is the school?\n\nIk this is a barrage of questions but thank u to anyone who answers haha",

            "comment": "1. For the most part, people are all on the same boat trying to make friends. It's pretty friendly overall lol. \n2. Future teacher too! I personally love the teachers and you'll be in the same classes as a lot of your peers. I swear I have like 5 classes with some and the classes feel welcoming because of it.\n3. I think there is because I get an email about once a month about jobs lol. If you work as an ra you get free housing and a free meal plan.\n4. Prom dorms are pretty nice lol. Idk if this holds any value but I heard Strawberry was the best dorm overall but that's just hearsay.  \n5. Lots of clubs but honestly not the best. The LGBT club is the most popular I would consider them an actual club, unlike the other ones. Idk what llp is...\n6. Honestly, the school is pretty isolated. There is a small shopping center like a mile away, but if you don't have a car you might be stuck on campus and not enjoying all Monterey has to offer. We do have public transportation but it sucks compared to other cities. If you do enroll I suggest you get a bike at the minimum. I have one and love it lol. There's a costal trail access nearby that goes all the way to Asilomar and it's not too bad of a ride. Been doing it once a week lately. \n7. The school is mad safe lol I feel like all Monterey is pretty safe. Unpopular opinion but I honestly don't think Salinas is all that bad either, but I lived there for a long time.",

            "comment": "For on-campus jobs, look into Otter Jobs. They\u2019re always looking for people to hire and it\u2019s great. You can make your own schedule and work max 20 hours a week. \n\nProm is definitely really nice. It\u2019s newly built and gives hotel vibes. It would be better to be in dorms for social life, a few parties but pretty exclusive. It\u2019s pretty easy to make friends, just be engaging and kind, everyone else is really sweet. \n\nThere\u2019s a beginning of the semester they call Club Rush, all the clubs just represent themselves and that\u2019d be a good opportunity to see what you like. Also, you\u2019ll be okay with or without the LLP.\n\nIt\u2019s quite isolated but the MST is free. There\u2019s a small outlet down the street with Target and food though. But the MST goes pretty far, even to San Jose I\u2019m pretty sure. \n\nHonestly, as a female, I haven\u2019t really felt scared on campus. I can walk on campus after midnight and feel completely safe because it\u2019s practically a ghost town at night. UPD is practically everywhere scouting campus too. If you ever don\u2019t feel safe, the school has campus security that you can call and they will walk you to wherever you need to go.",

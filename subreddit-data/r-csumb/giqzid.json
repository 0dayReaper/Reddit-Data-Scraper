I do have some previous background at a local startup I worked at while I was attending CC, and do have some side projects/professional references available. Just curious as to what the university can provide so I can keep my momentum going and put myself in a good position towards/after graduation.",

As mentioned in my reply to the other commenter, I do have some previous startup experience along with a few side projects/professional references. I\u2019d like to continue building on that momentum when I get over there and use whatever resources the University provides to put myself in a solid position after graduation. \n\nSo I suppose my questions boil down to:\n\n1: What\u2019s the SE/DS program like as a whole?\n\n2; Job market for graduates in those specific concentrations?\n\n3: Opportunities available to CS students within those concentrations?",

There are a lot more SE and DS majors here than there are game or network kids. Don't go game development as there are very very limited opportunities. The hype with the gaming community is very big but those kids tend to only click with each other and they don't branch out enough to get anywhere. I'm a SE concentration and I know a lot of other heavy hitters here as well. Maybe you'll meet me one day.\n\nThat being said, each concentration has to take different classes as concentration classes. But we all take the same electives. Data science is cool. I just finished it this semester as a class. It's run my Dr Bruns mostly. He is one of the smartest professors on campus and a very nice guy.\n\nIf you want to know more about the concentrations and opportunities I would get in touch with **Sathya Narayanan.** He is really the one who knows about opportunities and skills to pursue in the tech world. He has deep connections in the bay and I have had the pleasure to go with him to San Francisco a few times. He runs something called ABCs which is a class you don't have to sign up for just show up kinda thing where employers from companies come to the campus and you meet them, they run mock interviews and have recruiters come by so there's opportunities there.\n\nJob market for grads... I'm not particularly there yet but I know for capstone we see a lot of employers come to check out the projects.\n\nFor \\#3 I think I touched on that above. There are many opportunities locally in the area too.\n\nOverall, get in touch with the teachers as they have the connections and the information you're looking for.\n\nSathya for information, Vanessa Lopez is also good. She is the academic advisor for CS students.\n\nThe students like myself are also very helpful. You know the saying network network network! If you're ever on campus come find me. I'm a heavy hitter, part of the TA++ program and president of a fraternity on campus. Good luck my friend.",

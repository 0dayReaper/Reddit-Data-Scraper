I really want to be a child psychologist. My cousin committed suicide at the age of 11... No one was there for her. I want to help kids. It\u2019s a passion of mine now.",

I\u2019d say more than likely you will be accepted and I hope you choose our wonderful school! (It\u2019s been growing in size every year and we do have a new Student Union that\u2019ll open in Fall 2021!)",

It sounds like you\u2019re deciding based on the program rating but, don\u2019t be afraid to be selfish and choose an area based on outside of school life options. You sound like an excellent student that will do well in any psychology program. You might even do better in a smaller one because you\u2019ll potentially get more contact with the professors that way",

    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m a senior in high school this year(not in CA) but I have family in Monterey. I love the ocean and all the outdoorsy stuff this area has going on, and i\u2019m thinking of going to community college (MPC) for 2 years and then transferring to CSUMB. (Nursing major)\n\nIve already toured the campuses in person and i really liked them, but i\u2019m worried about the social aspect because it seems everyone either loves it or hates it. \n\nIs it easy to make friends as a transfer student? Should i live in the dorms as a junior? Is there school spirit and things to get involved in? What about dating?  Any advice about how you made friends here, things i should join, what to do and what not do do, etc. would be appreciated!! \n\n\n^note: i\u2019m super interested in the sailing club(i\u2019m pretty sure there is one i hope!)",

To make matters worse, getting into a nursing program through a CCC (like MPC or Hartnell) is crazy competitive.",

            "comment": "Generally transferring is a good way to save money and make sure you get in. Transfers, especially from our local three community colleges, of which MPC is one, tend to get priority. \n\nMuch of the rest is attitude, there are a lot of events (many more in non-covid times) to take part in and lots of people to meet. All in all it is a good school and a good deal. You may also want to look at Moorpark College and CSU Channel Islands (CSUCI). The nursing program there is top notch and they have a sailing club.\n\n That said students seem to be happier at CSUMB. The students that hate it, i think, had unrealistic expectations. The students that like it look for things to like. When I was an undergrad I was first one of the former but once I started to find things to like I had a good time.  Edit: I don't know much about the nursing program at CSUMB but I understand it is ALSO quite good.\n\nFor full disclosure I teach at CSUMB and did my undergrad at CSUCI after transferring from a community college.\n\nBest of luck!!",

Campus activities will be lacking during this time anyway. \n\nIt\u2019ll always be harder making friends as a transfer, but honestly with everyone coming back from COVID I think there will be a real opportunity for new connections!",

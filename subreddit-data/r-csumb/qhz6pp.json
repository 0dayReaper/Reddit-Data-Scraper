    "postText": "My buddy got handed this flyer the other day on campus. Dude was wearing a hoodie and jeans and asked if he had gotten one yet. He provided zero context as to what it was for and walked away. It says guest appearances by Fazar, Kareem, Qamron, and Sara as if we're supposed to know who tf those people are. It also has a NASA logo towards the bottom. EMON? Predator?\n\nI'm so confused but I wanna know what it is. Wtf is this\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2mgin7n9y9w71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=43b659ce214d82869c3652517b9618e0fe198d22",

I\u2019d also like to note that the man who handed me this poster, had a cardboard box full of them, but I haven\u2019t seen any on campus beside the ones he handed me and a few others.",

    "postText": "So, when I visited the website with the full details for the program, I came across the following: \n\n\u201cStudents will required to be online at specific times for course orientations, proctored mid-term and final exams, and occasional meetings with professors\u201d\n\nI have been a programmer for 6 years but I\u2019ve finally decided to finish my degree for a better salary (degrees matter sometimes). That being said, for those students completing the program or who have completed the program, What type of proctoring procedure/software do they utilize? I work every day of the week, so if it\u2019s just a zoom meeting with my cam and mic on, that would be great, but if they use some type of third-party software that needs to be installed exclusively for proctoring, it\u2019d be a bit complicated because I know you must be in a room by yourself and there shouldn\u2019t be any noise or voices from other people; which means that if a coworker needs to ask me something or if someone talks in the room I am in, I\u2019d be in trouble. Any insight on the matter will be GREATLY appreciated.",

In your final class, there is an exam that is required for all students. This is proctored by the faculty, but you will need to download a secure browser for this particular exam. These exams and orientations are currently always done on Saturdays (usually exams in the morning and orientations in the afternoon). You are expected to have a private area for the exams. I hope this helps! Happy holidays!",

And yes I believe you do need to be in a private area. The class I TA'd for did the final and midterm on a Saturday, but I can't say all classes will be like that.",

Personally, I submitted my application around December 2021, and received my acceptance email on April 1, 2022. I started the program in August 2022. I believe the sooner you submit your application, the faster you'll get a response. Keep an eye out for the deadlines to submit your transcripts and other documents, as they can be different from those for in-person students. I made the mistake of missing the transcript deadline because I was looking at the in-person dates instead of the CS Online dates. That's actually the reason why my acceptance email came in so late. Also, based on CSU requirements, I believe they must respond to you no later than April 1st.",

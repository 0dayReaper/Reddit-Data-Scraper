Does anyone know what it\u2019s like and if it\u2019s a good program? I\u2019m not quite sure what I want to study at this point and I need something where I can actually work after. Computer science is at least interesting to me (teaching myself how to code and I really like it). What are your thoughts on the program?",

It\u2019ll definitely give you a great foundation in CS. The software engineering and web programming courses were especially good. Graphics programming was really enjoyable as well, but taking linear algebra (not required for the program) ahead of time will make things make more sense in that class. \n\nI\u2019m currently doing OMSCS (Georgia Tech\u2019s online masters of science in CS program) and doing well in those classes. So, I\u2019d say CSUMB gave me the opportunity to be well prepared. I think you get what you put in :)",

Set goals kind of thing, so I can't speak for the actual full CS orientated classes yet.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Teams of 4 (I thought I'd hate this, but it pushes me out of my comfort zone and makes you get used to a team format, which is good.)\n2. Tons of support from professors + TA\n3. Weekly survey where you can tell them what you liked and disliked.\n4. Good speed so far\n5. MANY (required) connection opportunities. LinkedIn, and through faculty. \n6. One of the few programs where employers can't tell if your degree was done online or in person. (Huge one if you are 100% doing full online)\n7. They grade fast, and give good feedback. Only on like week 3, but so far everything has been graded within a week of due date often with comments and feedback.\n8. Professors are lenient, to a professional degree of course. If you make a genuine mistake you wont be heavily penalized for it. They understand and treat you like a human being, which is saying a lot depending on your past experiences.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Career exploration-esk first class (already did this kind of thing in CC)\n2. 2 large essays. I like the intention of them however. \n3. Teams are purely work focused, must write minutes for team meeting etc, I get it, but it feels very forced, leaves less time to socialize with team.\n4. All online, which is honestly more of a neutral point and VERY subjective\n5. In the future, we have to do like 25 hours of \"community service\" like activities just like in high school. Far into program, so not fully sure what that entails. \n\nIt's a very social program, it seems good so far, but it's not perfect (then again, only have like 3 weeks experience). The support from the professors IS THERE, which is reassuring. They clearly want to be involved and talk to you, albeit awkward if you don't want them to socialize with you. A lot of weird work in the first class, a learning journal, intro video, etc, but I think its to get you into good habits and is definitely a first class only thing.",

That\u2019s what I\u2019m most not looking forward to. I\u2019m already 24 and dropped out of csulb after finishing 2016 semester because my grandpa died. I haven\u2019t been in school until this January!!! I don\u2019t want to be in school forever but for an AS in comp sci it might be worth it. Do you still get financial aid in the form of waivers and grants or do you have to pay for the program? That\u2019s another big thing for me because I go to school for free but wouldn\u2019t want to chance losing that benefit.",

It says 24 month completion time so I\u2019m curious to know how that works. I get the bog fee waiver as well as financial aid. I think my disability services at Department of rehab would pay for it as long as it counts as public university",

I felt it was very comprehensive and am now working in the industry.  I definitely feel that the program set me up for success, however, as others have pointed out you will only get what you put it.  Online is hard.  There is a lot of independent work required, and the challenge will be on you to meet it.",

The current economy may have a lot to do with it.\n\nThat being said, I've seen people work at FANG from CSUMB so don't let that be your limitation.  CSUMB is a great school in general, and in my experience the teachers helped me to understand and grow better than any UC class where I would just be a number.  They were passionate about their students and it showed.\n\nRemember that employers not only judge you on whether you have a degree but also upon your work and in the case of CS, your commit history in your projects on GitHub.  As an employer, i would check to make sure you were going above and beyond assignments to learn beyond what the classes were teaching and applying these techniques to personal projects.\n\nMy suggestion, if you go with CSUMB, pickup a personal project that you are very passionate about and design an app for it, or many apps.  When you go into the job market an employer will see you applied your passion into something, and created it by yourself.  This will speak volumes and highlight you on the desk of any recruiter, or hiring manager. \n\nNo matter where you go, if you only put 50 percent in, you will be lucky to get 25 percent back.  Put in your whole effort and the reward will be greater than you can imagine.  Best of  luck on your endeavors!",

I was admitted to the Liberal Studies ITEP program, and I was wondering if anyone in this program could tell me more about it? Is the pacing manageable? I also saw something about a capstone project on the CSUMB website, and I was wondering if someone could tell me what that looks like for a Liberal Studies major? Thank you so much !!",

The capstone is for LS majors who are getting a BA but aren't getting a teaching certificate. The LS ITEP program is a combination of a BA/teaching certificate. It includes a year of student teaching. There is no capstone for the ITEP program.",

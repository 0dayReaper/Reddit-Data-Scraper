    "postText": "Hello guys, thinking long and hard about doing the online CS degree program at CSUMB, before making the investment i wanted to ask anybody who is already in about how many hours a week would one have to put in? How difficult are exams? I would like as much information as possible as I will be working full time a job in IT, not really worried about the coding and how in depth that is. Will it be manageable to work full time and finish? Everyone's input is appreciated",

There is a lot of group work and you have the same group while moving through the classes, so as long as you have a good group it is fine. There are some students that seem to be having a harder time with it so it also depends on your learning style. Being an online program it's self study, so if you are able to do that efficiently you will be fine. Most weeks I put in between 5-15 hours of work. Exams have all been easy after studying appropriately.",

They give you something to code and you have to complete it with the week, with the exception of one classes where it was a proctored coding final. They procter you through a webcam (only 2 classes have required this so far). Other non-coding classes have either been essay, multiple choice, or a combination of the two. Some of the coding classes have multiple choice or fill in the blank weekly quizzes based off that weeks assigned reading.",

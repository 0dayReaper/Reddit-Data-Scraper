    "postText": "Hey there! This fall term I\u2019m gonna be an international student from Germany. I\u2019m enrolled in the sustainable tourism program. \n\nBasically I wanted to know some tips for traveling. Which places are relatively easy to go to and definitely worth to visit. Therefore there won\u2019t be classes on Friday I will try to travel around on weekends. \n\nTips for places, transportation, and prices are highly appreciated :) \n\nI\u2019m thrilled to get to know new people and having a great time together \u270c\ufe0f",

            "comment": "If you have a vehicle, Big Sur is a must! Best to go on your free Friday, because traffic is a nightmare always but worse on the weekend. There\u2019s a lovely cafe called the Big Sur Bakery that has excellent coffee ($4-10) and pastries ($5-10). Entrees (~$20-40) are phenomenal, as well. Marvelous hiking trails with some really incredible vistas! If you don\u2019t already have the AllTrails app, I suggest downloading that. Our local trails are fairly well documented on it.",

The office said a couple weeks ago it would show up in my account at the end of June, and it hasn't yet.\n\nI've been trying to call but they suck at answering the phone.\n\nedit: actually just managed to get somebody on the phone in the financial aid office and she looked up how much i'll be getting in loans/grants and was able to tell me... if you can get through on the phone somebody might be able to do the same for you. she also said info will be posted for continuing students in the next 1-2 weeks, she said hopefully in the next week.",

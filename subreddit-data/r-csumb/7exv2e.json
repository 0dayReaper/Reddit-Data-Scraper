I just graduated with a worthless degree in English for teaching from SDSU (tried changing to computer science the last year but they rejected) and have been looking at good online programs for CS. I heard schools give more priority to students without a previous degree. Graduated with a 3.32 and have gotten  A's in a cs class and pre calc after graduating.",

I got my first BS at CSUS in a completely unrelated field (Speech Pathology and Audiology) will a 2.8ish gpa. So as long as you knock out the prereqs with good grades you'll be fine. I did go farther in math then was needed but I doubt they cared about that much. They got back pretty quickly after the application deadlines too.",

I've looked at a few student blogs that were made as a part of the program and many of the courses don't seem very in-depth. I know I'm probably going to be doing more self study than anything but I need to get a degree and this is the cheapest option at this point. ",

Compressing an entire class into that and maintaining the rigor of a more renown school isn\u2019t feasible.\n\nPersonally I do a lot of hackerrank grinding to supplement.\n\n",

It\u2019s not a full program, you basically have to take all your lower division classes and you transfer in as a junior. There are a few prerequisites that are required before they\u2019ll allow you to start, so if you are interested you should make sure to get them out of the way.\n\nThe program is very new, which means they\u2019re still figuring things out. But they\u2019re also very responsive to feedback.\n\nThere are about 30ish people in my graduating class. It\u2019s run as a cohort, so you basically enter the program and all take the classes together at the same time and in the same sequence. Each class is 8 weeks, but the last week is always short, so it\u2019s more like 7.5 weeks. There is a lot of group work, which is challenging because there is a good percentage of non-traditional students and people don\u2019t all live in the same time zone.",

    "postText": "I paid my enrollment deposit 8 days ago and was told that my housing wouldn't be accessible to me until it was verified and that I should wait until October 1. I found out two days ago that they verified it but I still cannot access it because it says 404 error. I know that tomorrow housing opens so I am really nervous about securing a spot to live on campus. Has anyone else been having this problem as well?",

I was wondering if anyone has any opinions about the quality of ENSTU program or professors or the capstone projects. I\u2019m also considering a focus on GIS, however I\u2019m torn between taking the few classes they have at CSUMB or getting a certification in GIS elsewhere. Essentially, what would be the best way to go about it?",

Silly question but does the latter mean strictly chemistry/physics/math?",

The electives are where instructors truly shine so funds permitting take as many of those as you can.\n\n I really enjoyed my time in the program, we went on tons of field trips and there's no substitute for that. Most of the classes are a blend of enstu/ ensci students so you can get a feel for both programs. There was a strong emphasis on communication, leadership and community involvement and soft skills when I went through\n\nI didn't take GIS but I know it kicked a lot of butts,  it's  suggested to take light course loads when enrolled in those classes\n\nI did a group capstone project that wasn't too bad we worked with a city  to put together a species guide/brochure for a local wetland but I know some capstone projects were much more rigorous",

I didn't have a professional network built in the area, so I had a harder time than my classmates finding an internship, but the program helped me get in contact with a local nonprofit and I ended up doing a fantastic internship in a river restoration project. Statistics doesn't come easy to me, but I do like coding in R, so to this day (I'm doing a PhD now), advanced stats are the bane of my existance but I developed a solid foundation in R at CSUMB and that's helped me a lot. Same with GIS, super valuable skill that has opened so many doors in my career. I took the undergrad intro to GIS at CSUMB and then the advanced course in the masters (and used it in a bunch of other courses in the program). It was challenging, of course. I'd spend entire days in the GIS lab during busy times, working on projects. But well worth it.\n\nOverall, I found the program rewarding and super helpful in my professional development. I had to work part-time my first year to help me pay for the program so that also made it harder for me (but proof that it's possible). I think individual mileage will vary, I had classmates that didn't love the program like I did, but for me it was a positive life changing experience. You should talk to the program coordinator if you have additional questions, I know it's early in your planning, but they're super helpful and can give you tips on how to prepare for it during your undergrad.",

I switched my major from environmental science back in 2019, because I realized calculus and chemistry were not my greatest strengths and I think it was the best decision I made. It was a few climate change courses and a lot more writing but if you don\u2019t mind that then I think you might enjoy the enstu program, as well!",

I didn't do Capstone because it's face to face this semester and I have relatives who are compromised, and because of Thanksgiving and Christmas, I didn't want to take the chance of potentially infecting them. I can avoid all of them next semester.  \n\nBut, it looks like I have to repay the $40 to graduate, hopefully, I can get my money back this semester.",

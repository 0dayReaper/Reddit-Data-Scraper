            "comment": "Hey! I\u2019m a Junior at CSUMB studying Communication Design and I HIGHLY recommend it. There are some quirks though: 1. Lots of classes, you might need to take an extra semester or two to finish them, that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing but I am getting a minor in cinematic arts so it might be because of that lol. And 2. The professors for the beginning classes (specially media tools and digital drawing) (Professor Webster) is impatient and really bad at teaching. Besides those two things I highly recommend. The classes are easy and push you for creativity, the work load is easily manageable. A lot of the classes I\u2019ve taken are pretty lenient on attendance, and a lot of them are easily stackable due to some being online. As for the major, it\u2019s a great major to choose. I love it because of how versatile it can be. You get to choose a concentration when you declare your major, my focus is game design, but there is visual design and web design as well. This major helps you a lot with developing skills in tech, they do a good job at teaching you from the ground up, starting off with simple programs such a photoshop and illustrator and slowly move you into more advanced areas. The projects are fun as well, you\u2019ll get plenty of stuff to put on your portfolio at the end, also I believe there is a portfolio. One of the classes you have to take towards your capstone is CST 300 Major Proseminar which (I haven\u2019t taken yet nor know little about) I think helps you develop a portfolio. All in all great major, a little dragged out sometimes but I\u2019d highly recommend it!",

                            "comment": "Hey! They teach a lot of other aspects of tech, for instance, they teach you beginner level coding. You can also get 5 units worth of electives which can introduce you to topics such as animation, brand strategies, photography and mixed media (there are tons more to choose from). Also CSUMB is a smaller school, not sure how many students there are as of now but usually around 7,000 plus which seems like a lot but isn\u2019t. I would say a good chunk of those students are communication design majors and I haven\u2019t met one student yet that doesn\u2019t love the major. I think the best thing about this major with this school is the more hands on teaching provided by smaller classroom sizes. Every person I have met in this major is very kind and open minded. Also do be surprised if there is a variety of ages in your future classes, the last class I had contained students both young and old, it\u2019s a very diverse major. Personally, it\u2019s not hard to shine in a communication design class, if you put time, effort and passion into those classes especially the projects your professors will love you, this is where the internships come in. There are such great opportunities for internships in this major if you look for them. Imprinting a good impression on your professors by asking questions, being attentive and putting in your 110% for your assignments will provide a strong foundation for your professors to want to recommend you for internships or other opportunities as well. There are also great programs at CSUMB that help connect students to internships, I get about 5 emails a day recommending me to internships for my major but unfortunately am not looking for an internship right now. Personally, the classes are not hard, and they don\u2019t require a lot of time contribution to get an A, currently I\u2019m on my majors deans list and it\u2019s been great maintaining it, I\u2019ve actually been gifted a scholarship for it twice now. As for projects, almost every class I\u2019ve taken has amazing projects. I\u2019ve noticed a lot of professors for communication design are open to all forms of creativity which means their rubrics arent stiff, if you have an idea for a project that\u2019s outside the box don\u2019t be afraid to purse it! A lot of the projects I\u2019ve been given so far are really fun, for example the starting class you\u2019ll take which is a prerequisite for upper level classes is introduction to media tools. This class we had projects geared around photoshop and illustrator such as creating movie posters, advertisements and so on from beginner level teaching. I will include my movie posters below to show how that introduction class took me from knowing nothing about photoshop to amateur level quality in one semester :) Also, there are tons of clubs that you can join relating to your major too! All in all I highly recommend attending CSUMB, this might be a totally biased perspective on the school but this is my truth :) let me know if you have any more questions, I\u2019d love to answer! ALSO forgot to add, huge benefit is we get access to all adobe products, I have adobe 2022 photoshop and illustrator downloaded right now :) it\u2019s a dream[class project](https://imgur.com/a/HIntIVm)",

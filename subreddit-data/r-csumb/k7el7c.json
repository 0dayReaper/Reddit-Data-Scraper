    "postText": "I\u2019m currently a communications major at a community college and I\u2019m hoping to transfer to a CSU. Currently I\u2019m trying to decide what schools would be the best to consider. So far it\u2019s between Sacramento, San Jose or Monterey. I\u2019m considering it because I took a campus tour about 2 years ago and really loved the feel of the smaller campus and Monterey in general. But I know that\u2019s not the only reason to apply to a school. So, are there any communication majors out there? Or anyone who\u2019s transfer into the communications program? How\u2019s your experience? Do feel like the program is preparing you for a career after college? And is there anything else I should now before considering csumb?",

I have been able to build relations with my professors and be a part of their research teams which I can imagine is much harder to do at other campuses. It really allows for more opportunities. Hope this helped!",

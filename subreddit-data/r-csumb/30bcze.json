We are constantly working to help improve the accessibility of our services, including training to first responders, gate-keepers, and anyone who might be interested in learning more.\nI hope that we can all continue to grow and offer support to people who may be suicidal or otherwise in danger with respect, kindness, and restraint.\n\n*I also apologize for removing my original reply. I had an accidental username switcheroo.",

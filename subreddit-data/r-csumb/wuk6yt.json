Its a social media app, so you can post pictures, comments, like posts, reply to peoples posts etc. You can have a profile too. But its suppose to be super inclusive so you cant follow/unfollow people. The feed consists of just everyone who has the app posting. Its nice though, you can ask questions on there, ask for advice, complain about a prof, sell stuff on there and everything. Or just post a meme haha",

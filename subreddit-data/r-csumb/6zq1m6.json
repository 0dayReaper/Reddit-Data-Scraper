    "postText": "Hey yall, I'm currently a student down South looking to transfer to a small and affordable school in California, to be able to get away from the South mainly. Anyways I discovered CSUMB and I like what I see so far. However, I do have a couple of questions.\n\n1st: What the hell is a \"unit\"? Is that just a credit hour?\n\n2nd: I'm getting different results on the Cost of Attendance page, so I would just like to know how much do you think it would be for an out-of-state student looking to do 15 hours a semester and live on campus?\n\n3rd: What is the financial aid like?",

            "comment": "A unit is just a credit hour yeah, classes are relatively cheap but idk what out of state costs are sorry. The rent in the area goes from 500-800 depending on how nice you want to be situated (single or double room). And financial aid depends on your tax situation/parents taxes. Most people get around 3k a semester in my experience.",

It asks me how many units do I plan on taking but I have no clue if it means per semester or per year. \n\nIf I plan to take 15 credit hours a semester, do I put in 15 units or do I put in the full 30?",

    "postText": "I live in east campus as a graduate student, so they can only room me with a graduate student. Grad students get their own room, no doubles.  I have no roommate and I hope it stays like that. So far, I have no roommate assigned. I am wondering if graduate students have already moved into East Campus for the Spring to know if I am in the clear.",

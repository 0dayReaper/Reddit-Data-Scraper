    "postText": "I applied to transfer next year, but I am thinking about changing my major to CS. To do that, I will have to spend 2 more years in community college before transferring. I just found the CSUMB program. I only have to have 3 prerequisites. I have 1 out of those 3. I just wonder if it is worth it and if I would get a good job afterwards.",

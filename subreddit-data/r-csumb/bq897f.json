    "postText": "I an studying to get my BA in Psychology and have the choice between CSUMB and SJSU. \n\nSJSU is so expensive, but I've read that their Psychology department is pretty good. It would take me an hour to commute there and an hour back, assuming there is no traffic. \n\nCSUMB is 30 minutes away from me, so the commute wouldn't be as bad. I am leaning towards going to CSUMB, but is their Psychology Program good? \n\nI want to join clubs and maybe even a sport. I also want to go to a university that has opportunities for internships. Is CSUMB a good choice? \n\nI plan on going after a doctorate certification program like those at UCLA, UCR, and UCSD. \n\nI am a typical 4.0 student, will I be able to get into a doctoral program with a Psychology Bachelor's from CSUMB?",

            "comment": "A Psychology degree from CSUMB or SJSU will be worth exactly the same when you come out. It all comes down to what you do while doing your degree that will make a difference. I don't know what SJSU offers inregards to internships but CSUMB has the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Center (UROC) which will absolutely get you ready for a doctorate right after a bachelor's and at the very least give you valuable experience. As for any other opportunities or internships, get close to all your professors, they are a wealth of knowledge and experience. Too many students float through college thinking their degree alone will be enough...It's not! Especially if you get in debt for it. The only thing I can say is wether you go to CSUMB or SJSU it will be up to you to take advantage of the opportunities that will be there, both will have them. I hope this helps.",

    "postText": "I just started this semester here at CSUMB and I am absolutely miserable. I want to do something in the sports journalism field and I don't feel like the classes here are going to help me get to where I would like to go. I really want to play soccer as well but I am not good enough to play for the school team and regret not trying to play on after I transferred. I have an academic advising appointment again on Friday during spring break and I going to tell my adviser that I decided to transfer out. Do you know anyone who has done that?",

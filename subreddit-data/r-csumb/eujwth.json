But honestly like the other commenter said park off campus near the gym on 2nd ave so you don't have to pay for parking. Don't pay if you don't have to the parking is ridiculous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA friend of mine was talking to chief and he was boasting that they made 1$ million+ in parking revenue in 2018. Just goes to show what they're really after",

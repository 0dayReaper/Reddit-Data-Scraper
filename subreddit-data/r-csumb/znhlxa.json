I\u2019m still not impressed with what they have done everywhere. it\u2019s so bad, I\u2019ve seen passengers cuss out bus drivers, showing their anger and distaste towards the new schedules, how certain lines end early, how certain lines only run at specific times\u2026or in my case, having to walk or bike such a distance, just to get on a bus. I hope the MST administration enjoys there 2 week vacation, cause come the new year, there will be tons of complaints via phone and email, as well as a long line of people waiting to express their frustrations at the next board meeting in January",

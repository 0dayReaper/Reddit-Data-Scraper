            "comment": "I think that's kind of an ignorant way to look at it. \n\nHave you looked into the facts of the fee increase? Have you asked around about it? Or just said \"oh more money so it must be bad.\"\n\nI don't necessarily agree with it either but not just because it's more money out of my pocket. It's not a huge increase when you look at it in the big picture. The fee has not increased in since 2001, and things have really changed financially since then. Instead of $48 dollars a semester it will be $70. The money goes to some really useful things to students like scholarships, grad programs, on campus events, and lots of other areas of student interests. \n\nOne thing I learned that makes me not completely agree with it is that 1/2 of the money gained from student fees that go to the Associated Students goes to the 3 AS advisors for their salary. In my opinion, AS being the small size that it is, does not need 3 advisors to \"help out\". I think for now, 1 hard working and hands on advisor would be sufficient. \n\nAlso, these fees are included in your tuition, therefore can be covered by financial aid. What's another $22 bucks a semester? \n\nI am going to vote yes on the fee increase, because I believe that AS will be responsible with the extra money they get, and will be able to support the growing student body (which is dramatically rising and will continue to rise in the next few years).\n\nI hope you are able to do some research and ask around about the fee increase before you vote on the 24th.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not in AS or have any ties to the school other than being a student. Just like to be informed about the things happening at my school that I pay a lot of money for. \n\n\n",

These facts do not convince me to get over the cost. \n\n$22 is not much but it is money. If I do not receive financial aid to cover tuition then I have to pay it out of pocket. \n\nI would be more likely to vote yes if the fee increase was guaranteed to be used for things that directly help out the entire campus. Or i normally enjoyed the events put on by AS (I do not).  As you said half of it is going to probably unnecessary advisers. \n\nAre the benefits worth the $22? I am not sure that they are so my final decision is based around my value that spending more money is bad.\n\n\nWhat is it that convinces you that AS will be responsible with the money?\n\n",

I see it as putting in what I'm getting out, and I do enjoy the events put on by AS and hope to take advantage of scholarship opportunities that they offer. \n\nI went to the AS forum on Monday night where AS candidates had three minute speeches and answered questions regarding next year. \n\nIn the beginning of the forum the current AS president explained the fee increase in detail and answered questions people in the audience had, and from that I truly think that AS needs the money, and will spend it wisely.\n\nCSUMBs AS is the only AS in the entire CSU system that is not incorporated, which means they have access to no outside income other than the fee's and it is way more difficult to carry out events and scholarships, and even just benefit the students.\n\nI feel like CSUMB has a reputation of being \"boring\" or \"there's nothing to do\". If AS got this increase they will be able to support more funds to clubs and have bigger/more events.\n\nAlso, thanks for your response, didn't mean to sound hasty with my original reply. ",

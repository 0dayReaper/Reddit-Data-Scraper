    "postText": "Hi! \nSo I found out today I was accepted into CSUMB! I\u2019m a transfer student from a community college going into a liberal arts major so I can be an elementary school teacher. \n\nMy question is how did you guys make the decision to attend this school? I\u2019m between this one and CSU Bakersfield. Bakersfield is a lot cheaper and I\u2019d be able to commute from my hometown rather than moving to csumb. Any alumni can I ask if the student debt you received was worth it for this school? What was campus life like? Are the professors harsh? \n\nPlease let me know if I broke any rules and I\u2019ll adjust the post. Thank you!",

I personally didnt get a ton out of the experience because like someone mentioned, if you dont have a car you won't see much of it. I would recommend you choose the more affordable option 100/100.",

Not a lot of night life but tons of outdoors stuff. The campus is a bit out of the way. If you don't have a car you might not see too much of it. I've only been in Bakersfield once in passing but Bakersfield looks a lot bigger than Monterey lol.",

It doesn't even come close to Monterey. Do you want to live in Bakersfield for the remainder of your degree/first years as a \"professional\"? Plus, what is there to do in Bakersfield?",

I'll risk going into debt if I can live in one of my happy places for a few years, it'll be worth it to me. I think your happiness is something to consider. There is a positive correlation between happiness levels and academic achievement. I totally understand the financial concerns, I'm right there with you lol.",

Throughout high school, my teachers were telling me they'll be paying off student loans until they were in their mid 40s, and that the debt wasn't worth it. Unless you want to become a professor (and then only for your Phd), the names don't mean much to prospective employers. I chose the cheaper and did not regret it.",

            "comment": "I transferred as into Social Science with the goal of being a teacher myself. CSUMB has a credential program and one of the few graduate programs they have is in education. After I got my history degree I continued straight on into the credential program. It was good and did a great job at preparing me for all of the state requirements. If all goes well I should complete my masters this semester! \n\nI managed to get out of it with some debt but right now California is picking up the bill for a lot of people trying to become teachers. This last semester didn't cost me anything. I was also able to secure a job immediately after completing my credential with some help from the school. \n\nI think it was worth it and from what I can tell CSUMB has a good reputation for making good teachers. As far as campus life? Nothing notable but I have made some genuine friends in my time here. I have had excellent interactions with every professor I've had. \n\nGood luck and welcome.",

I\u2019m now teaching 4th at a local school. I loved my experience with CSUMB. I liked going to a smaller school. The class sizes are awesome. The teaching program is great and helps you make connections in the community. Professors vary but they do everywhere. The credential program here will try and encourage you to stay here and teach as the Monterey area is lacking in teachers. Especially due to the pandemic. \nGood luck with your choice!",

            "comment": "I was also between CSUMB and Bakersfield for the same reason. Bakersfield is about 45 minutes away from my hometown, so commuting was an option. However I chose CSUMB to get out of the valley heat and to experience being on my own away from home.\n\nWhile CSUMB isn\u2019t the best, but which college is, I still would not have done anything different. I\u2019m in my last semester of my BA in Biology, and have to take a gap year to get my credentials for single subject.\n\nMy student debt isn\u2019t too much, I would say it\u2019s a lot more doable than others, but that was with financial aid and being old enough to not be a dependent. To be honest, you\u2019ll have student debt no matter where you go unless you\u2019re lucky enough to get everything paid for.",

The surrounding towns are 1/4 the size of Bakersfield and not nearly as much to do. Had I known the environment of CSUMB I would have stayed home and gone to CSUB. The commute is definitely worth it to CSUB, not to mention you\u2019ll get about the same education and be able to stay home with family and friends.",

Roomie is taking a gap from CSUMB and I am a current student- Don't have a facebook or I'd post on the homeless otters page as well.\n\nWe are looking to stay close to seaside/marina/the campus. Both of us are chill gamers who keep are own spaces clean and what not, so if you are looking around please message!\n\nOr if anyone knows any place to post/look for roomies please let me know! I don't mind having to get into on-campus housing, but I am trying to see if I can find a place with my roomie.",

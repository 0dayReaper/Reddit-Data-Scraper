    "postText": "I've posted on this site before so forgive me if I do become repetitive. I'm most likely transferring here in the spring and while I am preparing this for the next semester, I was wondering what to do about the social scene. I didn't socialize that much at my community college because there weren't many clubs going on and students generally kept to themselves and I do not want that to happen if I go here. I'm a pretty quiet person and I get nervous socializing but college is a great place for fixing that and was wondering what people to do here to make friends, go out, activities. Is there anyone on here who goes here who wants to stay in contact or know of a csumb site that students go on? Also, any spring transfers like me out there who want to stay in touch? ",

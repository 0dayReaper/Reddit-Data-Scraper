    "postText": "Curves in Aptos is a circuit-based gym that promises a quick 30-minutes of full-body strength training. While we are a bit farther than most options in your area, our gym has a wide-range of community that travel from Seaside and Watsonville, some are members of the CSUMB faculty. Our gym, which our demographic is mostly fem, is inclusive to everyone who has a goal this summer to exercise their body in preparation to exercise their mind in the fall. \n\nWe offer student discounts, as well as different plans ranging from online classes to in-gym with personal coaches available throughout with no extra fee! While there is cheaper gyms in the area, like Toadal and others, they don't have access to consistent training, nutrition plans, and the accountability that we offer at our gym without an extra add-on price. \n\nWe want you to feel comfortable in your own skin, working out with a community that want you to be your best as they work to become their best. As a coach who just transferred from Cabrillo to CSUMB this summer, I can say that the workout before class is rewarding and has bettered my education through confidence and the uplifting energy of the people. And I will continue to coach at this gym while attending class on campus there in the fall, so there will be a familiar face :)\n\nSchedule an appointment today, or come walk in and check us out! (MTWF: 6-1, 3;30-6:30 TH/SA: 8-1)\n\n\\-Coach Megan \n\n(831) 688-2348 / curves.com",

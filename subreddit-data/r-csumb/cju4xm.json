I would say parking in back to a semi normal capacity. \n\nTell you what, why don't you wait 2 weeks into the semester and see how it goes? If it's any consolation, as a student soon to be a Fredrick park resident, you will still have a permit for east campus. Who knows? Maybe you might enjoy walking more. \n\nOr buy a bike. Those Lime scooters will put you in the poorhouse.",

Maybe they\u2019ll be done by the time the semester starts, who knows. \n\nLime scooters were great for getting around campus in my opinion, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be getting them back. CSUMB had a one year contract and it doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019ll be renewing it because of the insurance issues between Marina and Lime :(",

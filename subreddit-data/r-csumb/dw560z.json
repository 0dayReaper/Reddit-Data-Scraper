    "postText": "Hi!   \n\n\nMy house has housed Otters for the past 7 years! Wooh! and one of our large, full bath included rooms is up for rent. I'm looking for 1000$ with full access to the bathroom. Or negotiable for allowing the adjacent room access.   \n\n\nThere are 4 others in the house and this room is on the second floor with three of the other roommates rooms. We do have a very spacious place. About 10K Sqft. Which is huge! Plenty of toys and I have us set up with 1gb/s internet. Bills usually run between 125-150 a month and the bills include water, heat/elec, comcast with quarterly trash due. I would expect a 800$ security deposit with move in date rent for the first month. I'm super willing to work with people to help the right person fit into the house. We are looking for long term roommates. so if you are a seasonal student. We would rather find a better fit.   \n\n\nThe house has spacious garage, plenty of road and driveway parking and it isn't east campus. lol. But please hit me up if you are looking for a place. More than happy to send some pics.   \n\n\nCell: 831-205-7373  \n\n\nBest,   \nMonty",

Housing is a joke, they still haven't answered any emails/calls from weeks ago. I paid their bullshit 200$ fees and have yet to receive any housing in WEEKS.\n\nIncoming Freshman: Don't leave anything up to these idiots. Take care of everything yourself, call and annoy them if anything is wrong, because they sure as hell won't fix it.",

Myself and many others students emailed multiple times asking them to disclose what they were using tuition money for during covid. They charged full tuition which usually covers facility fees, recreation, and health services but a majority of those services were not even available for students to use. We paid $170 for recreation during the covid school year. There was no recreation. They dodge questions they don\u2019t want answer all the time. \n\nBut I am curious, you say they cover up crimes what kinds stuff are you talking about?",

I am curious as to why you said they didn't answer because I literally called around a week ago with some questions and emailed a couple days ago and got an answer in a day. Like I can see why that would be frustrating but this is college. They aren't going to hold your hand through 99% of the things you do. If you have been truly waiting weeks for housing, that is something that I hate to say is partially on you for not trying to contact them and get that resolved, especially since they sent out an announcement a couple weeks ago saying housing assignments should be out. Like I agree they have to put in effort as well, but at least in my interactions with the school, they have been pretty thorough on helping me with any questions and concerns, so it could have just been your experience.\n\nI do agree with some people in the comments however regarding the shady tuition fees and how we had to pay full for things we didn't even get to use. I really don't see why we did and that's a huge problem since a lot of us are working nonstop just to pay tuition and still having to take aid. I assume however that this was a CSU problem that stems from outside the school specifically because I have had other friends that go to other CSUs that had the same thing happen to them.\n\nI also am very curious as to what crimes you are referring to? I would love to know. \n\nGood luck getting that all figured out. Housing can be super stressful so I can get why you're frustrated with the school, but I assure you that if you contact someone and have paid your fees, it will get solved.",

Full tuition and full payment but 95% of all classes only offered online (even though they've been lying to us saying they're ready for a vast majority to be in person, they're not even offering in person classes except labs). Literally have 0 classes this semester in person because none of them are even offered in person, such bull. They also straight up removed like all of the KIN classes that were fun. Surfing, diving, sports, disc golf, biking, none of that is available at all.\n\nI'm living off campus nearby with a roommate. It's cheaper, it's easier, less restrictions and so much more freedom. Plus, I don't need to be on campus wasting money for overpriced food or for super restricted living conditions at full prices. \n\nI'm excited to be back and glad i don't have to pay housing a dime.

I\u2019m still deciding between Monterey, Channel Islands, and Pomona but was leaning towards Monterey. What has your overall experience been like at the college and is the psychology program good here?",

I'm not too sure how many research opportunities there are, but there is an undergrad research center. The school is small, but there seems to always be something going on. It's in a quiet and sleepy town, if you're transferring from a bigger city/town then it can be off-putting. I think it's a good school for the price.",

Also due to the small size of the school you get to know people pretty quick. I\u2019d say every class I take has at least 5 people I already know. Number is like 50% in major specific classes. Living accomodations are pretty good all around for transfers, you have a pretty good amount of options. Also as long as you\u2019re actively looking it\u2019s pretty easy to find internships and research opportunities, local employers (especially local small businesses) are very active with CSUMB and love getting students involved in their work. \n\nEdit: It may just be my degree (ENVS), but I think a large majority of the people I talk to in stem at MB are planning on going for their PhD sometime in the future, so Im sure you wont be alone in your search for research opportunities",

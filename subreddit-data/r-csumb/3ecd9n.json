    "postText": "Our Flash Mob 5k is coming back to CSUMB on October 17th (starts and ends in the Otter Sports Complex Stadium) and all proceeds benefit our local Children's Miracle Network Hospitals program. This year we have some additions, including race timing (yay!) and a HUGE discount for CSUMB students with an active csumb.edu email address. We're looking for some otters to help spread the word! Check out www.dancedash.org for more info. ",

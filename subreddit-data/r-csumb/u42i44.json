    "postText": "When you call the office to request a change they act like it\u2019s impossible to do but then they\u2019ll switch your roommate on you without warning? Doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019re setting people up for success by placing random people into the units, especially when we have preferences that match the unit requirements. To occupy a single room (no roommate) on EC it\u2019s 950+ a month! I get that it\u2019s below market value for the area but come on. Don\u2019t we get some say in who we live with?",

I'm trying to find a place office campus for the remainder of my time at CSUMB. Housing ain't getting my money after the mess its become.",

Thanks for checking, though!\n\nIn regards to the costs of the program, I want to note that since the CS Online program is offered through the extended education department at CSUMB, our tuition rates are different than the on-campus programs. We do not have a California resident/Non-CA resident tuition. Our tuition is $525 per unit for all students regardless of residency. You can find more information about the tuition rates and other fees here: [https://csumb.edu/csonline/tuition-and-fees/](https://csumb.edu/csonline/tuition-and-fees/).",

However, I'd recommend keeping an eye out on our website or join our email list. If we have any events for our next application cycle, those will be the first places that will be updated. \n\nWe do not require any internship for graduation, so there are no specific CS Online internship opportunities. All students enrolled in our program will have access to the career center and the CS career counselor.",

Just something to note is that since our program is fully online, our program is not eligible for those who are seeking education visas since those will require some type of in-person instruction. If you have any questions regarding the visas, I would recommend reaching out to the international programs office as they are definitely the experts. \n\nWhen it comes to taking the prerequisites online,  I always recommend looking at the California Community Colleges as many of them offer classes online. However, something to note is that if you are living internationally, you will likely have to pay international rates for those classes. \n\nIf you find courses that you think may work for you, please email me and let me know and I would be happy to verify those courses for you.\n\nHappy holidays!",

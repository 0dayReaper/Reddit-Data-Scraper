It has a green button that has info on their partial parking permit refunds due to COVID-19. It has a link to a Google Form you can fill out with your parking pass info. If I remember correctly, this is for Main Campus, North Quad, and Promontory. \n\nWhether we actually get any money back is another case. I filled it out this morning and haven\u2019t heard much besides an automatic Google Form copy of my answers. Although the information is on the website, it doesn\u2019t seem to get pushed or announced much; I found out by chance from a friend who posted it on her Insta. Anyways, your refund is supposed to be based on when you submit the form, with the last day for a refund being listed as April 21st.\n\n[CSUMB Parking Services](https://csumb.edu/parking)",

    "postText": "So, I'm going to try and set up some Friday Night Magic/Draft stuff at CSUMB. It will be pretty casual, with matches, deck building, learning/helping mtg skills. It will probably involve food, drink, and prizes if it manages to get a little traction. Let me know if any of you are interested; experienced and beginner players are all welcome :)\n",

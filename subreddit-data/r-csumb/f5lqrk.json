    "postText": "Hello, I plan to transfer next fall to a four year and CSUMB is an option. I would transfer as a Visual and Public Art major. I visited during the open house last year but no one was around to talk to near the studio buildings. It doesn't seem like there is a lot of people in the program. Does anyone have any more info on the program? Is it good or a specific area in art they are known for? \n\nI love the school so far but don't know if it's the right place to get my degree.  Is anyone else also taking the degree?  One of the reasons I might go there is for the science illustration program after finishing my degree but illustration would not be my only focus. I would focus on photography and ceramics and maybe illustration or painting later on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn terms of, housing I have two options East Campus or Promontory. Promontory is quite expensive though so I am leaning towards EC more. I want to have single occupancy in either place. \n\nAny advice you guys can give me? I am still emailing about other things with the departments but these two are a priority to figuring out where I am transferring to. Thank you",

            "comment": "Unfortunately, I can't give much advice about the whole major thing. But I would definitely suggest East Campus as far as housing goes. More than likely you will end up in a two-bedroom one bath house with two roommates. There are some single-tenant or double-tenant houses, but the vast majority will have three.\n\nEast Camp comes furnished or unfurnished, and looking back, I probably would have gone unfurnished, and spent some of those savings on furniture. The stuff they give you is serviceable and much better than what you get on campus, but still definetely dorm furniture. You'll want to consider renting a washer/dryer, as there are a total of 10 dryers and 10 washers for the ENTIRETY of East Campus, split across three or four neighborhoods.\n\nIf you have any specific questions feel free to DM me or ask, and I'll try my best to answer!",

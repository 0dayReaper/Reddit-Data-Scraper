    "postText": "Hey everyone!\n\nSo, I've narrowed down my choices to CSUMB and two other CSU's (Long Beach and Chico). I was supposed to visit the campus last week but then everything in the world happened. I just have some questions on your experiences and what to expect.\n\nWhat is campus life like? How are the dorms? Are there fun things to do outside of campus?\n\nAlso, if I were to go to CSUMB, it would be as a Cinematic Arts &amp; Technology major. To everyone that has been in the program, how was your experience? What are the facilities like? What are the professors like?",

            "comment": "I am a cart transfer also. The thing you should know about the cart department is they have bunch of new teachers and the teachers are mostly industry professionals that are also teachers. Some are super passionate some are push overs. There's a lot of new professors and some half are great half are kind of pompus. The equipment is good the students are pretty cool too. \n\nI recommend living in East campus (you have to be 21 or older and be fulltime student) it has way more space, 3 people to a unit, kitchen, garage and a washroom. You can drink and it's pretty lowkey. Be aware that parties typically happen over in this area.",

            "comment": "Not a cart major but this campus is unique. I know for a fact that the cart program uses avid media composer. \n\nHousing is okay but over priced. I would try to live on East campus. Get a shared room unfurnished $580 a month, busses come every 15 minutes.\n\n This is the cheapest University in the entire state. \n\nThere is fun to be had all around if you look for it ( the student Union had DDR and Billards) \n\nThe Cart department has green screen and 4k cameras. \n\nPlease come here and give it a chance.",

            "comment": "Personally I like the campus life there was events that were free that would get you involved on campus (or just a chance to get free things). There is a good amount of support for transfer students as well (I transferred). I am not housing in the dorms so I cant speak on that but I do hear they are nice. There isn't much to do outside of campus but if you are into pinball there is a cool pinball arcade in Seaside (like 15 mins) and there are plenty of trails to hike if that's your thing as well !",

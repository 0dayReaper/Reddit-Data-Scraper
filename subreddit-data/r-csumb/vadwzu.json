People are generally friendly, and most of my professors are responsive to students both in class and in office hours. All the staff I have come across in the year and a half I\u2019ve been here have been genuinely nice and helpful. I\u2019m also in UROC, so if you are interested in research, I can tell you that that group is simply awesome and super focused on student success, both personally and academically. \n\nThe scheduling thing can be a bit frustrating for first years. Once you are formally a student, you should meet with your academic advisor as soon as possible to put together your learning plan. Once that is done, I recommend meeting with them every semester to go over your remaining requirements. \n\nThe bad things are things that are bad everywhere: increasing bureaucracy and corporate stinginess.",

I\u2019d say the biggest problem is that oftentimes the management kinda sucks. It\u2019s a real problem that the school has. For example, the start of last year the food situation was terrible. We had a good two weeks with no options but pizza or burgers every meal. That\u2019s gotten better! But it reflects on the management. Also as a club officer I\u2019ve had significant trouble working with the ICC (inter club council) on getting reimbursed for approved funding. There have been some other issues as well. That\u2019s probably the main issue I have with the school. The professors and other faculty are great though, and the school culture is pretty cool. If you do come I would suggest looking into joining some clubs or otherwise being proactive with finding a social group because I personally found it difficult to find a social group outside of a club setting. You kind of have to be actively social rather than passively social if you want to find a good friend group. They are out there, but it\u2019s sometimes difficult to connect with people. Like I said though clubs solve that problem pretty well.",

Almost no school is perfect and serves all its students in the best way. Sometimes you just have crap admin no matter where you go. Good luck in your journeys!

The new buildings of the university are pretty nice, but the majority of the buildings are outdated. Then freshman housing isn\u2019t the best but can be bare able if you have a decent roommate. The only decent on campus housing is Promontory, but they have limited spaces. Housing fucked the upperclassmen this upcoming year leaving the majority of them in freshman housing.\n\nAs many people stated above, all universities are flawed; there is no perfect place. It all depends on (1) what you\u2019re looking for, and (2) how you can work with what they offer. Personally, I chose this school for the location, which was my first mistake. I declared my major in Kinesiology my second year and began to take my major course work that same year. Immediately, I noticed a disorganized, and frankly, crumbling department, barring one or two decent professors. Each individual should make their own evaluation on the effectiveness and ability of a professor. However, I was taken a back by the numerous warnings from fellow peers and even faculty about the professors in the department. The head of academic advising had told me to not enroll in a course because the only professor teaching that course, which is the head of the Kinesiology department, was having difficulty passing his students. \n\nUltimately, I have decided to not continue my undergraduate education at this university because the location was simply not enough to cover up the dishevelment and ineffectiveness of my department.\n\nJust keep in mind that my experiences may not align with other students or even your future with CSUMB. The best advice I can offer is to deeply consider what you look for in your education and any potential dealbreakers when choosing your program.",

You have heard all that they said about Hillary Clinton. \"Crooked Hillary\", et cetera. Well, Wendy Smith is all that too.\n\nHere is an actual email sent to Wendy Smith.\n\n==+==\n\nWhat is happening here is nothing short of an utter travesty of justice.\n\nWendy Smith is doing less than prostituing the entire legal profession by arguing that a person who is willing to meet is, in fact, refusing to meet. This attempt at shifting blame has not gone unnoticed.\n\n\"\n\nIsn't that grammatically incorrect? Should it not say \"prostituting the entire legal profession'? I say there is a typo.\n\nThoughts? Comments?",

I am not a troll. \n\nAnd no, I don't think I need to do much more than what is required by normal way of course at reddit to prove that I am not a robot. I just clicked those squares that had a \"House\" in it. There's no computer algorithm devised so far to do that automatically. I believe that is why they make us do this.\n\nThe Computer Science majors can add their two cents to this, but I believe I am right.",

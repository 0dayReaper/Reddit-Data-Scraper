Do staff go through your stuff to make sure you aren\u2019t bringing anything you shouldn\u2019t? For example- a hot plate, a dog, drugs?",

Nobody cares really about what you\u2019re not supposed to have, just don\u2019t talk about it and wave it around. Don\u2019t have a dog though that\u2019s really obvious and people actually question that",

I haven\u2019t received any news on which day and time I move in.. and I supposed to sign up somewhere? \n\nAlso... if the apartment number in north quad begins with a 2... does that mean it\u2019s on the second floor? I am bringing a filing cabinet but I know I can\u2019t carry it up a flight of stairs alone lol",

And yes it\u2019s on the second floor but fortunately north quad has elevators so you won\u2019t have to carry everything up the stairs, but I can imagine elevators are crowded on move in days, especially since north quad is four stories.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m concerned about something with the survey. You have 2 questions with answers of \u201cvery likely, somewhat likely, somewhat unlikely, and not likely at all\u201d, and a third question with answers of \u201cextremely likely, very likely, somewhat likely, not so likely, and not likely at all\u201d. From an outside perspective, it looks like you might be trying to add an extra positive result to that specific question to try to skew the results. While I don\u2019t think that that is the case, I am curious as to why that question had a different set of answers than the other two similar question.",

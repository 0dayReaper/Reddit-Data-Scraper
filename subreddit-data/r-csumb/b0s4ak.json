    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm an Irish guy in my mid twenties travelling to California this summer to attend the US Open in Pebble Beach. My problem is I'm finding it extremely difficult to get accommodation that does cost an arm and a leg!!\n\nIs there accommodation in CSUMB that gets rented out for the summer? Or can anyone offer some suggestions to help? Your help would be greatly appreciated..!\n\nI'm pretty easy-going and am happy to crash anywhere for the few days so any help you guys could offer would be fantastic. \n\nThanks guys! \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea",

Clean and safe.\n\nI don't think the campus offers any temporary lodging for non-students.\n\nYou are correct that lodging in Monterey is very pricey, especially during the Summer months. Seaside and Marina are fairly close to Pebble and much more affordable, and you can take shuttles to the tournament from several locations near there which you'll probably end up doing anyways.",

Google couch surfing...there should be a site. Low budget airbnb, if you're not familiar. \n\nEverything else was booked out months in advance and anything left will be at exorbitant rates (motel 6 for $500+), which I think you've discovered.\n\nBest if luck",

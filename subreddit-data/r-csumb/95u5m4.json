Apple tends to be more expensive, so I would say go PC.\n\nI would recommend Mac only if you were either going to be developing software for MacOS, or if you are a graphic designer since their culture favors Macs and you are more likely to get a job with them if you are familiar with one.",

            "comment": "Sometimes a Mac environment is easier to work with (since it's Unix based, makes certain things much easier than on Windows) but I don't think that justifies the cost of them. Like someone said earlier if you are just getting started I would just get a PC, the only thing is if you want to develop MacOS or iOS apps you will need a Mac. \n\nThis upcoming semester is my first at CSUMB so I don't know the details on what the courses require, perhaps someone else who has taken the courses can chime in?\n\nAnother thing is, don't buy the cheapest PC out there. Do a little research and find something that has a decent CPU (at least a modern Intel Core-i3) and preferably an SSD, it will make for a much better experience. If you want some recommendations let me know. ",

            "comment": "I heavily prefer apple for coding. The built-in in terminal is very nice, and I've never had problems with my Mac laptops, unlike my pc laptops which all died in a couple years.\n\n I'd highly recommend going onto amazon and buying a used one. As long as you read the store reviews there should be no shady stuff going on. I actually work for one of the companies that sells on there. I find it ridiculous now that people go and spend thousands of dollars on new computers, when many of the used ones work just as well and only have a few scratches for a fraction of the cost. Pm me if you'd like the name of the company I work for to buy from, it's really a pretty good deal. ",

I also have 2 Lenovo Thinkpads before Lenovo corrupted their BIOS by embedding bloatware within it.  I am looking for a light weight laptop that has an i5 or better. I love my Thinkpads but hot damn are they heavy. I like the weight of Apples but I not the price, I am indifferent of Microsoft surface but it seems to be good for drawing art and taking notes in class.  Any suggestions on a $1000 PC that is actually worth $1000?",

It's a convertible so you can use it as a tablet. The processor in this laptop is an i5-8250U which is a 4 core 8 thread which has a base frequency of 1.6 GHz but turbos to 3.6 GHz. It has a discrete GPU if you do any gaming. I'm not familiar with the Thinkpad lineup but this weighs about 4.5 pounds, so compare that with your Thinkpad and that will be a good measure of how heavy it is.\n\nI will add another reply later with some more options just wanted to give you something to look at in the meantime.\n\nEdit: [Here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075N1YHVK/ref=psdc_13896615011_t3_B075FLBJV7) is another option that has the same exact specs as the above computer but in a smaller form factor. It is not a convertible like the above laptop though. ",

I don't mind paying for my own room if possible and don't care about where I end up in housing as long as I could bring my cat.",

            "comment": "Register your pet through SDR (ASAP - my mistake was waiting). Once your doc fills out the form and your pet is verified, you won\u2019t have to pay any fees for them to live with you on campus. ESA\u2019s can\u2019t come with you to class, though. \n\nI got my own room in EC by specifying my need. I was completely honest about my emotional process and I think that helped. Also, get your housing app in e a r l y. Main Campus fills up extremely fast, and it was already mostly full by the time I applied - and I applied the day the app opened. I was sort of cornered into switching to East Campus.\n\nThere are only so many counselors to the amount of students who go through SDR, so sooner is better when it comes to getting the process started.",

    "postText": "Hello Sea Otters! I am currently applying for the CS Online Program for fall 2023! I have questions regarding acceptance rate/ difficulty being accepted. With the way my life is, this program would be perfect for me, and is my top choice. I finished all 7 of the Pre reqs required with mostly A's. My current GPA is a 3.85, but due to me possibly getting a C in calculus 3 it may go down to a 3.78. I was wondering if anyone could provide me insight into the stats they had and whether or not they were able to get in. Do you think I stand a chance, or is it more competitive than one may think?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Hi there! Happy Thursday. :) \n\nWe're excited that you are excited about the CS Online program. Since we currently give priority to applicants who have all 7 of the prerequisites, as well as the basic CSU transfer requirements, completed at the time they submit their application, you would have a higher chance than someone who may be missing a prereq or two. We actually do not give any priority based off of GPA at this point, so as long as you meet the minimum 2.0 GPA requirement, you would be good on that front. \n\nThe CS Online program is pretty competitive at this point, but you having all those prerequisites completed will definitely help. I would recommend that you apply for the priority evaluation cycle. The deadline for the priority evaluation period is November 18th. Your Cal State Apply application must be submitted by this date, and all official transcripts from all colleges attended (as well as any official exam scores like AP, CLEP, etc) must be received by CSUMB on this date in order to be eligible for the priority evaluation period. I hope this helps and hope you have a wonderful rest of your week!",

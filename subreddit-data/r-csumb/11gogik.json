    "postText": "Any grad students at csumb, what does your tuition look like? Not including housing or meal plans. \n\nAlso I think it is absurd that until you\u2019re 24 that you are considered dependent even if your parents/family are not contributing at all to your schooling. Im 23 and when I did FAFSA they asked for my parents income from 2020?? Like my dad is retired now and not going to pay for my schooling, how does that make sense?? Wack.\n\nEDIT: I also don\u2019t live at home, I pay rent and everything myself. My parents havent claimed me on their taxes for a few years now too. Yet universities consider me dependent? So lame.",

My only complaint is it seems like you don't get a huge amount of practical application in many classes. I'm a networking concentration and it seems like the majority of what I'm studying is all complex sometimes theoretical problems rather than actual application. I have difficulty in thinking this isn't really going to prepare me for network administration.",

In fact, it is critical that there is a clear connection between what you are doing now and what you plan to do in the future. This is the exactly the service you pay the university to provide (not to be confused with what the university pays lecturers, of course. That is a whole other issue and should not influence your expectations of the university).",

Even now years later I'm studying for CISSP and I'm breezing through the networking sections knowing the distinctions between hub/router/switch/firewall and layer2/3.  Also having an idea of how ARP and DNS work will really help you narrow down problems in systems administration.",

If it's Game Dev, the reason I came here, look elsewhere since it's a total fucking scam.\n\nPrepare to take boilerplate CS courses that have nothing to do with Game Dev that you're forced to take while there's shit like CST 321 - Game Design and Interactive Media I, CST 323 - Character Design, CST 322 - Environment Modeling, CST 422 - Level Design that goes untouched. \"Those are Communication Design major, but you can Minor in it too (read: pay us more to learn what you came here for) teehee :3c\"\n\nSenior year, I've taken 1 (arguably 2) Game Development courses so far with 1 more to go. Absolute ripoff, might as well teach yourself through YouTube tutorials and shit if you want to learn Game Dev since it's a scam here. I'm going to graduate with fuckall practical knowledge and a degree that will be useful if I want to be a Network Admin or something but I literally know less than someone watching GameMaker tutorials off of YouTube outside of the one class I'm taking right now.\n\nBoilerplate classes are either absolutely useless like CST300 Major ProSeminar which is literally a waste of time and money and exists for the professor to self-fellate about how great he is, learned nothing and had no idea what the point of the class is even to this day. Other classes seem like they're mandated to teach a certain amount of content so they just machinegun through the content, fuck you if you wanted to learn a specific subject. You're pretty much expected to teach yourself some Courses. You're also expected more or less to be fluent in certain concepts coming into the class and no prereq teaches those skills. Teach yourself git and github, sorry, we won't go over it, just know it already. Be fluent and an expert in C/C++, fuck you if your other universities before taught primarily in Java, learn it on your own on the fly.",

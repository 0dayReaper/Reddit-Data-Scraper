If you are majoring in one of the Arts Majors, Math 100 is the only math class you have to take.\n\nMath 98 and 99 may be prerequisites for some students to take PreCalc, but not students who have already completed the high-school level equivalent courses and didn't bomb the math portion of the SAT.",

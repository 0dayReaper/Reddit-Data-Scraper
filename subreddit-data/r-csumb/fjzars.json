    "postText": "Campus Community\n\nCSUMB students should plan to attend the remainder of the spring semester virtually, receiving instruction at their permanent home residence. Exceptions to this are those students who need to be on campus for enrolled lab or studio courses and any student who feels safer in university housing.\n\nStudent\u2019s who feel safer in university housing are welcome to stay on campus. This includes any student concerned about securing other housing options, or those who may have limited access to technology or the internet.\n\nResidence halls and campus dining venues remain open and operational with social distancing. As stated previously, all current residents who feel they need to stay are welcome to stay on campus. \n\nStudents who live on campus who do not intend to return to campus for the semester should take their belongings and complete an express check-out with Student Housing and Residential Life.\n\nReduced campus operation during suspended classes\nBeginning Tuesday, many university staff members will work remotely, reducing some on-campus operations and services. This move prioritizes the health and safety of the CSUMB community while classes are suspended.\n\nLibrary and Student Center changes through March 22\nThe library cafe area will remain open for computer access 24 hours a day. While the cafe area is open, the remainder of the library is closed until further notice.\n\nThe Student Center is also open, weekdays 7 a.m. - 8 p.m. and weekends 10 a.m. - 8 p.m. The furniture in public locations is rearranged to accommodate health and safety standards; please leave it in place. Student Life is creating virtual engagement opportunities to maintain connections with all students. Please check the website for creative activities and ways to participate during this time.\n\nEvents\nAll campus events are suspended, regardless of size. Student groups may meet virtually using Zoom or other technology to maintain contact. The Otter Sports Center and Aquatics Center are closed until further notice.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the CDC guidance on mass gatherings, Spring 2020 Commencement is postponed until further notice.\n\nStudent-workers\nStudent employees may continue to work remotely for the respective department. If remote work is not possible, they will be paid for the hours they were scheduled to work. This is only through March 27. Students who work for a third party contractor such as A\u2019viands or UG2, need to check with your employer for specific details.\n\nDining and bookstore changed March 17 - 30\nThe following locations are take-out and to go only and may have reduced hours of operation:\n\nStarbucks \nMonday - Friday 7a.m. to 7p.m.\nSaturday - Sunday Closed\nOtter Express; Montes; Verve\nClosed\nDining Commons\nMonday - Sunday 8a.m. to 8p.m.\nConvenience -Store snacks \nBookstore Hours\nMonday - Friday 9a.m. - 3p.m.\nSaturday 11a.m. - 3p.m.\nSunday Closed",

I\u2019m a 6th year student and these 6 years have not been a walk in the park at all. I\u2019ve gone through so much bad personal stuff and had almost given up so many times. The one imagine that would push me through when I asked myself is it even worth still trying, is that moment when I\u2019ll hear my name and cross the stage and move the hassle to the other side, signifying that I did it. I got through it. Being able to come back and hug my mom in my cap and gown on the field, knowing that after all I\u2019ve been through I pushed through it even though everything going on told me to give up. To be able to take pictures with everyone and have that moment saved forever to show my kids of this great accomplishment. Now that image that I used to help me can\u2019t even come true...",

I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been working so hard and pushing through, only to have your dream, your main reason for enduring so much, crushed. I\u2019m so sorry you won\u2019t have that beautiful experience with your mom or take plenty of pics to show your kids. \n\nI made it a personal mission (more like obsession) to graduate in 4 years out of spite, just to prove everyone who was telling me I was throwing away my future in high school by not applying directly to a university and would never get out of my community college wrong. I was looking forward to this graduation because I worked so hard, made so many wonderful friends, and it\u2019s been my dream since I was a little kid. But with the current situation, I\u2019m resigned to not having a Capstone festival, a wonderful Commencement, or even the chance to properly say goodbye to my friends, professors, or campus. I don\u2019t like it, but I can\u2019t change anything or even think about it much without feeling robbed of the experience I worked my butt off for. \n\nI know it sounds cheesy and we don\u2019t know each other, but I\u2019m proud of you dude. Even if it all sucks, I\u2019m proud of you for holding on and working so hard. I\u2019m proud of everyone else who has worked so hard, as clich\u00e9 or fake as it may sound. It isn\u2019t easy and it won\u2019t seem special if there aren\u2019t any graduation ceremonies, but that doesn\u2019t take away how much effort everyone has put in. You may not have pictures to show for it, but you\u2019ll still have your degree and experiences to show and inspire your family, a symbol of your perseverance and strength. Congrats! :)",

It has a link to a Google Form you can fill out with your parking pass info. If I remember correctly, this is for Main Campus, North Quad, and Promontory. \n\nWhether we actually get any money back is another case. I filled it out this morning and haven\u2019t heard much besides an automatic Google Form copy of my answers. Although the information is on the website, it doesn\u2019t seem to get pushed or announced much; I found out by chance from a friend who posted it on her Insta. Anyways, your refund is supposed to be based on when you submit the form, with the last day for a refund being listed as April 21st.",

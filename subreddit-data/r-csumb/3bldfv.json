I'm not too familiar with good makes or models, but do note that if you keep your bike outside it will rust because of all fog.\n\nCampus is a bit hilly, so the gears are a must. Also, there is little shopping center close by that is an easy bike ride, but a bit of a slope so the gears make it nice and easy.\n\nNow if you want to be more adventurous and go mountain biking in the nearby areas, (which are amazing and really fun) then definitely a mountain bike.

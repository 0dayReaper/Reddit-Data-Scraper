    "postText": "Has anybody gotten their financial aid or student loan disbursed yet? I think I have done everything required of me, but I was told not to worry about my current balance due for tuition or anything because it will be taken out of my aid/loan and the remainder will be disbursed. But if I don't pay tuition before the 5th, then I don't get to go to CSUMB this semester, so I can't help but worry. \n\nI have done my Cal Grant stuff, my loan entrance counseling accepted/declined rewards, FASFA, etc. but no word yet and it just feels like we're coming down to the wire here.",

So your place is reserved in all your classes, and you can just go along as if your tuition has already been paid. \n\nI don\u2019t blame you for being confused. I was in your spot a year ago. Dealing with financial aid has been pretty frustrating.",

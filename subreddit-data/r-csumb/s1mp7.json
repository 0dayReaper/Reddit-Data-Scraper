    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nSo one of my roommates is moving out in the middle of May, and we need someone to take his place. The unit is an upstairs unit on Gettysburg, and there's no one (I think) below us, and no neighbors. Very quiet! We generally don't throw parties, so if that's a normal thing for you to do, you'd probably be better off somewhere else (not saying we don't party, we just like our quiet and sleep at home).\n\n420 friendly, and if you're a gamer, all the better!\n\nLet me know if you'd be interested!\n\nEDIT: I'm moving with him now, no need for any more roommates. Sorry :(",

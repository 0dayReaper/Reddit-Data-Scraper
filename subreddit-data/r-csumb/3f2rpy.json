    "postText": "Hey Otters! I know school isn't in session yet, but I wanted to let you know about a 24 hour gaming fundraiser that's coming up to support Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.  \n\nExtra Life is like a walk-a-thon, but for gaming (any game - video games, card games, tabletop games, even Facebook games) where you collect donations / sponsorships and then game for a total of 24 hours FTK (for the kids).  Check it out at www.extra-life.org. \n\nWe have had some awesome support from the CSUMB Gaming Club and we want to get even more gamers involved this year. \n\nOur local CMN Hospital is Salinas Valley Memorial, and donations fund newborn and pediatric equipment and services here at the hospital and also fund medical needs grants (for things like wheelchairs, walkers, therapy, etc.) for kids across Monterey, Santa Cruz, and San Benito Counties.  Funds stay local to help local kids. \n\n",

You need to include details. \n\nI know absolutely nothing besides the fact that there is an mother organization that is hosting this event and people can participate. Which is what i learned from their website and not you. So, if you're going to keep posting this at least include details.\n\nEdit: words",

Thanks for asking the questions! \n\nMore details: Participants sign up online and then collect donations from family and friends, much like in a walk-a-thon or a Relay for Life. That's the fundraising component.  Instead of committing to walk x amount of miles or x amount of hours, you commit to game for 24 hours and your donors are essentially sponsoring you. Their donations are all 100% tax deductible. \n\nMany Extra Lifers live stream and encourage their followers to donate, but it's not required (Twitch is a major national sponsor of Extra Life). The gaming marathon happens wherever it works for you - it's not an in-person group event unless your team decides to make it one. So, you can game at home, in your dorm, on your phone, at a friend's house, wherever.  You can play solo or with friends.  The CSUMB Gaming Club had an in person event in an on-campus computer lab 2 years ago for their team, and they ended up doing the full 24 hours together as a group.   \n\nLocally, we are working with Steinbeck Center in Salinas to have an in- person event on game day (Nov. 7) for several hours, and they've got a nice 16 foot screen that they're going to set up for some tournmant style play.  The idea is to have food and games set up, sort of like a gamers' lounge.  Plans for that are still in process.\n\nThe nice thing about Extra Life is that even though there is an \"official\" game day, you can break up your 24 hours in whatever increments work for your schedule. I work full time and have two kids, so I break mine into 4-6 hour chunks and play after the kids are in bed. Sometimes we break out the board games and they get in on the gaming too.\n\nHope that helps, and thanks again for asking. I'm new to reddit (can you tell?) but they are also a supporter of Extra Life and have been encouraging us to share the event with our local subreddits. ",

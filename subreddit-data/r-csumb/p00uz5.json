I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably one of the most useful Majors at CSUMB that will ensure you can start a career after graduation without having to go in to a Masters program first.",

Since the department is small getting to your know your professors in a one on one setting is more then possible and encouraged.  I\u2019ve only had one issue with a teacher but overall it\u2019s been good. I know students have gotten jobs after graduation or have jobs while finishing up there school but to land those positions you need to stand out ex. Portfolio of projects or have connections.",

It sounds cliche, but it's completely true. You can just get by and do enough to pass your courses and get the degree and be done. Or, you can explore the areas that really interest you, use the resources available to you to gain knowledge and experience that goes beyond building a career. Making sure you have these experiences will inform your choices later in life.\n\nI would recommend joining a club that interests you and taking courses for lower division requirements that look like they'd be fun. You will probably enjoy your time there a lot more if you actively engage with the opportunities that are presented to you there.",

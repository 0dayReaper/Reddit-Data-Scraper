    "postText": "I'm considering transferring in for Fall 2017.   I would like to live on campus because it's my first time away from home and I want to get whatever social experience I can.  How likely is it that I will be able to get a single room in the Prom or regular housing?  I am not interested in the East Campus.  The problem is that I have to decide on a college before I know the answer on housing yet the housing will affect my decision.",

This past year lots of people were put on the waitlist for housing and had to scramble to make arrangements until they got placed. The school is going through growing pains and so there's competition for housing. I'm hoping to get a spot in East campus but I'm moving onto campus, not renewing, so even though I applied early I don't have first priority. So it's a crapshoot. I'd call housing to get an official comment on it.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m looking into the cs online degree completion program at csumb. I also have the ability to transfer to CSUDH for cs, but I\u2019m sure all the classes will be in person, which will be hard since I work full time. Which program would probably be better for overall success in computer science? CSUDH has classes that seem a bit more \u201clegit\u201d or relevant to cs. But csumb, being all online, would be much better for my lifestyle. I plan on transferring spring 2024, since I\u2019m changing my major after receiving my communications associates- which means I\u2019ll take an extra semester in cc to finish prerequisites.",

            "comment": "Caveat: I\u2019m associated the the CS Online program to a degree so I am quite possibly biased, but try to keep it under control. Also, edited to say this is just my take and unofficial and all that jazz. It also means I can only talk about csumb since I don\u2019t know csudh \n\nIt sounds like csonline is much more similar to what you want and what you think you\u2019d learn better from. The goal is to focus on students who work full time or don\u2019t benefit from traditional classrooms. Many of the students work full time and things like orientation and office hours are held on weekends or evenings to make it easier for people who work full time during the week. \nFor the quality of the degree, it\u2019s not an knock off of our in person degree, but is instead meant to be the same quality, and a lot of effort is out in to get it there. The classes I\u2019ve looked over the material for have been more intense than the classes I took as an undergrad at a different university, and they are very serious about academic integrity so it\u2019s not just a walk in the park. Also, if I\u2019m not mistaken, csonline has students take a standardized test at the end (can\u2019t remember the name but it\u2019s like a college board test or something) to demonstrate knowledge.\n\nThey also very much care about the progression of the students with student support people (her name is posted on the website but I feel weird saying it on Reddit lol) reaching out to students who are struggling, falling behind, or haven\u2019t heard from in a week and want to check in on. The cohort nature of it is also really good for that. \n\nSo basically, I think if you\u2019re thinking about it applying would be a good idea since it seems to fit your needs. It\u2019s not uncompetitive (there\u2019s limits to the cohort size) but could fit what you want",

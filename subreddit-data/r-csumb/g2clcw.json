Anyone have any tips, suggestions, or recommendations?\n\nWhat\u2018s normal rent in the area in your experience?\n\nI don\u2019t have a MB email yet so I can\u2019t join the Facebook housing group.\n\n\nAlso I guess if you want tell me about the school. I\u2019ve never been. What are some good and bad things about it? Anyone in the education department? Do you like it?\n\nThanks everyone.",

And do they help you or match you with roommates?\n\nThe 2nd year of my program is part time. I read on East campuses website site that you have to stay full time. Can you confirm that? And if that\u2019s correct. Any other apartment recommendations for that 2nd year?",

If there's any music scene on campus or around, i'd love to try and make something work. Nothing serious, or maybe something serious who knows.\n\nThanks",

I'm pretty decent at improvising and playing solos, I don't have much of a preference when it comes to what I play I just enjoy playing with people. If you have any preferences or music you listen to I'm open to whatever. \n\nLately I've been playing chillhop lofi stuff, as well as some like rock/metal. There's also like jazz and hip hop and psychedelic stoner stuff. I have an acoustic and electric with pedals so I can play in a lot of different sounds. How about you?",

I\u2019m not to good as a soloist at the moment due to my lack of theory (if you could teach me some that\u2019d be awesome) but I am pretty well versed when it comes to playing rhythm guitar. I\u2019ve been learning some Pink floyd stuff like echoes, so I\u2019m really into psychedelic music too. And also jazz is something I love to play and about a year ago I started slightly playing some lofi / neo sounding guitar",

I'm really into A7x so i learned a decent amount of metal, but not the really heavy stuff. I also love floyd and a lot of stoner rock. I'm good at soloing, if you're good at rhythm im sure we could bust something cool out. I'll send you a message, thanks!",

I also like Schubert's Songs(Lieder) if it's an instrumental cover. I could definitely write chord charts for those if you're not into sheet music. I've really started getting into Stevie Wonder's music a year ago, although I do have a much better ear than most classically trained musicians, so transcribing any melody is always piece of cake and pop comping is easy for me. \n\nI'm down for anything, whether it's vamp/drone improv, comping/improv for whole songs, songwriting, or sight-reading duets from sheet music. Since I'm not a specialist in any genre, it might take me a little bit of time to figure out some things if the song is more than a standard chord progression with extensions and non-functional harmony(I hate the term but you know what I mean). \n\nDo you have a microtonal guitar? I listen to Sevish from time to time but I've never had a chance to make microtonal music on the spot.",

I've only learned small amounts from real teachers but I've been learning music theory for the better part of 3 years now and I've been practicing guitar for about 4 years. I can typically learn most chords by ear if they're not complicated, I spent a whole year learning some of my favorite songs and guitar solos by ear. Melodies and slow solos are easy for me to learn. I've learned some very difficult solos as well, but I would never be able to learn a song from a band like CHON, Polyphia or Covet by ear.\n\nI would like to write music to play, but am also up for anything. Usually I just improvise with a friend or two, but I do have experience with writing(not a lot but I've written a few instrumental guitar parts for complete songs) I will say I don't know how to read music but that's never been an issue for me because my musical ear has grown a lot and I've never been part of an ensemble. \n\nAs for music I listen to, I listen to a lot. Lately I've been into chillhop and more jazzy tunes, but i also listen to a lot of old school classic rock and heavy metal. I'm a huge fan of progressive rock and metal if it's really good, and I dont stick to any one thing. \n\nI'll send you a private message. Thanks for the response.",

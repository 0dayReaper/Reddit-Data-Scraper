    "postText": "Hello, so as the title states, I've been accepted for Fall 2020. I'm a COM major and plan on pursuing my dream of becoming a sportscaster one day. Though I would want to start in journalism or some type of similar media outlet. So I was wondering how is the communication department here? In particular, humanities and communication with a concentration in journalism and media studies?\n\nMy other question is how is East Campus? I own an EV so I would need convenient charging at the apartment and I believe there are outlets in the garage as well as a 10-30 drier outlet in the apartment? I plan on moving in with a domestic partnership so I would apply for the family license. Has anyone had any experience with that and how the process is for that? \n\nFinal question, is there any chance that CSUMB would allow me to move in early? Or is it really strict with move-in dates and what not?\n\nThanks in advance!",

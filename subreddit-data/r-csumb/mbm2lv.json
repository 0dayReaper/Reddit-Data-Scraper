    "postText": "Hey everyone! I may be attending CSUMB for graduate school in the Fall but I want some insight about the school and its surrounding community. I will be moving from Los Angeles if I do attend, so I'm not familiar with anything up North. It will be a whole new experience for me. Any tips for school, housing, or any beneficial information would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

Monterey and Pacific Grove are nice but more expensive. Carmel and Pebble beach are too pricey for a student. I\u2019d recommend finding a place to live where you enjoy the surrounding neighborhood and commuting to campus. Living on CSUMB campus is not like a lot of schools, you can\u2019t just walk into town, you\u2019re on an old military base. A lot of the buildings are new or renovated but there are still a lot of old military buildings there and some active military offices and buildings still.",

North is Mendocino &amp; Humboldt.   The student housing works out great for some people! Plus side you can have a pet (cat or a dog on ground level) in student housing. However, it is pretty far from town. There seems to be tons of roomate situations if that\u2019s something that interests you. It doesn\u2019t appear to be feasible for anyone to afford to live on their own in a studio but as an undergrad idk grad student life. if you somehow have time to work, it could be possible?",

I definitely want to live off campus because I do see that it is cheaper. I just wanted info on good and safe cities/areas that are relatively close to the school.

I think I will be going off campus for the fall semester (if we actually go back) and so far in my search I haven\u2019t heard anything unsafe. I have been told not to live in Salinas. However, i think that if you found a spot where other students live then it would be fine. I don\u2019t know the student areas in the town at all. Also, male or female, whenever you move somewhere always check the Megan\u2019s Law website. You never know.",

Good to know everything is convenient and pretty close. It really is. I've moved out for my undergrad but that was about an hour &amp; a half away from where I live. Now it will be 5 hours so it's pretty intimidating living away from everyone I know. But I'm also excited, it will be a new experience if we do have to end up going back in person",

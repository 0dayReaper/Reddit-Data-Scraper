I transferred in so I can\u2019t say much about the first 2 years, but currently I can say that I feel sufficiently challenged by the curriculum. The professors are firm but they know their stuff and they\u2019re here to help you out. Would recommend.\n\nCS is a good major for CSUMB because there\u2019s very little university name clout in the CS field, and CSUMB is very affordable.",

I make good money and do not have to sell my soul working for a FAANG or silicon valley startup, but could make the jump with my education if I wanted to. Thanks CSUMB, really great professors who will go the extra mile to teach and provide you with career opportunities.",

You get $4,000 but you have to dedicate roughly 6-8 hours in weekly meetings or you will lose some scholarship money. You will be expected to put work into it outside of that time so it's real time commitment and I might exit from it in the upcoming year because they just make it harder to cooperate. So it's up to you if you want to join the CS++ program for the money and possible connections.",

Most people don\u2019t end up becoming a software engineer with a cs degree from here. Save your self and don\u2019t go. If you do go make sure to take every class bruns offers",

Every class is dropped in difficulty by like 1.5 years. Their advanced algorithms class( the one I instructed) had a syllabus that looked like a intro to algorithms class. I am not working at a FAANG company. However only 1/100 students really get a good job. Most people from my graduating on campus class are working jobs that don\u2019t require degrees like amazon fufilment center driver, waiting tables, etcp",

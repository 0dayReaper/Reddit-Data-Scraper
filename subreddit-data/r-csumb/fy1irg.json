    "postText": "Hello,\nSo I am considering transferring to Monterey bay for computer science. I have a couple of questions, as I am torn between this school and Cal state east bay; closer to the bay.\n\n1. Hows the social scene here? Is there a dating culture or is it quite reserved? \n2. I know one positive thing about east bay is it is near a tech hub which means a lot of job outlook, I am potentially looking to work FT while attending school, specifically working a job that has to do with my major. Is there any tech jobs in the area or is it completely desolate. \n3. I been looking at the prices of apartments around the area and it seems almost on par with east bay, would you recommend dorming or is there a facebook group or something to find roomates?",

            "comment": "Hello fellow CS major! If you are wanting to work full time in CS while also going to school I would look elsewhere.  \n\nThere is some opportunity here for CS students but much of it requires a fair bit of experience from what I have seen. Also, it is almost exclusively federal government work either with the Naval Postgraduate School or the Department of Defense, so if you're into startup/techy style workplaces you definitely won't find it here. The occasional county job pops up here or there and they pay pretty decently but it's pretty rare to find an opening and they get a lot of applicants when there is one. \n\nIf you don't mind a party scene, [east campus housing](https://csumb.edu/housing/east-campus-apartments) is the way to go, it's the cheapest apartment style housing you will find in the area. It's technically on campus housing but it's removed from main campus and feels a lot more like an actual apartment. That being said it's the only campus housing where students can somewhat get away with parties so you will have to deal with that if you decide to live there.",

I guess that's more of my interest, if there are any companies around the area. Thank you for the suggestion about the housing; I'll look into that.",

I am currently looking for jobs right now and have been looking in this area too and many jobs are either Revature spam or senior level positions. SoCal has a decent amount of jobs probably because of the density down there, there is bound to be some good jobs there and who knows it might turn into more of a tech hub later on! \n\nThe CS program itself here is actually quite good from my experience, I have really enjoyed it and we have a lot of good instructors.",

            "comment": "Former CSUMB Student, I was there from about 2004-2011 and lived in Monterey for several years after as well.\n\nVisit campus before you decide where to go. I've never been to Cal State Easy Bay before, but I spent a lot of time at CSUMB and can say the campus is different from most other colleges in how secluded the campus itself is from Monterey/Seaside/Marina as a whole. The campus location for me was a pretty big downside. There is quite a bit to do on campus though, in terms of activities and socializing with other students, but it would be nicer if the location was different.\n\nThere are tech jobs in Monterey, but not like you're going to see in San Jose/SF/Oakland. There are less people though, so the job market is less competitive there than it would be in the Bay Area.\n\nCost of living in Monterey varies depending on what town or neighborhood you live in. There are certainly some very affordable living situations in the area but they may not be in the nicest part of town and you will likely need roommates unless you can afford $1200-$2500 to live in a single apartment.\n\nAs a transfer student, you might not want to live in the dorms with the 1st, 2nd year students unless you really want that dorm college life experience and you haven't had it yet. I think it was a blast but I was 18/19 and pretty sociable. You should also consider other housing options, like apartments, or duplex or something close to or on campus where you will be living with other students, but not necessarily in a grimy dorm area. I'm sure there are facebook groups or the college has a way of connecting you with other students looking for housing.\n\nThose are my thoughts, you can PM me if you have more questions.",

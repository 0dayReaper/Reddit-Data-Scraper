    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m looking into places to transfer to as a marine bio major, and I just wanted to ask if it was at all possible to get a single room dorm at CSUMB through disability, or if it would be better to live off campus? (Please note: I currently can\u2019t drive and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to by the time I transfer; I\u2019m far too overwhelmed and it\u2019s difficult for me to focus while driving. For my safety and everyone else\u2019s, I tend to take public transport.)\n\nI\u2019m currently getting assessed for ASD and I have severe social anxiety, so both options are pretty daunting to me, and I was hoping for some advice on this. What would you all recommend? Is it even possible to live on campus without a roommate, and what would the cost be if that\u2019s the case? Is it cheaper to live off campus, despite not being able to drive? Thank you for any advice you could give!",

You would want to talk to Student Disability Resources about housing accommodations. \n\nPrior to the pandemic CSUMB had some pretty good public transit options, which included free bus service through MST, the local bus service. That went away when everything went virtual though, and I don't know if it's coming back.",

It sounds crazy, but  getting a parking ticket in a handicap space with a handicap permit, and their refusal to void the ticket, was the straw that broke the camels back. I insisted that they send the matter to the local courts as required by law and they flat out refused. Add to that being harassed by campus cops a couple of times and that was it. After five years of teaching at CSUMB, I was outie. \n\nPeople ask me occasionally what it was like working at CSUMB and the best description I can relate is: it was like working at a minimum security prison.",

    "postText": "So, I understand there might be a bias in this community, but I've got a neighbor who goes to Humboldt I can talk to about that side of things and no one from Monterey.\n\nI'm a transfer student who's been accepted to both for Fall 2023, and time is *really* running out to make up my mind... but I'm horribly indecisive. My ideal would be a fairly small campus but with a close knit community where it's possible to make new friends, on-campus housing, good nature and walkable/easy public transport access to a nice nearby town (parents insistent I won't have a car). And then obviously the most important part is academics: classes I like in a major I like. I've visited both schools and liked the size and surroundings of both. \n\nMy current pros and cons list: \n\nHumboldt has way more interesting classes for what my major would be there. It also has a very prevalent drug culture, which I'm not judging anyone for but feel like would be isolating and make it hard for me to connect with people. My neighbor said \"if you don't like the smell of weed or being around people smoking it you shouldn't go there\". I did fill out the housing app already and said the lowest tolerance I could for all those options just to minimize my chances of having a roommate who will hotbox the room lol but given what I'm hearing about the situation there I really wouldn't have much choice. Humboldt also has prettier nature imo. The trailheads right on campus are super appealing.\n\nMeanwhile Monterey has classes that interest me less on first impressions, but also has a science illustration certificate that is SO up my alley. The surrounding town is way more appealing to me. It's closer to home by a few hours which would be convenient. And I know this is silly and should not play a part in my decision but... come on, sea otter mascot? I want that so bad. (joke I promise I'm not gonna pick based on the mascot)\n\nI've heard, from skimming posts here, that Monterey is *so* small and quiet it's hard to make friends, that the housing situation is even worse than Humboldt rn, and that it's really not walkable. But I really don't know if I can get over the drugs at Humboldt, it is just really not my scene. So I guess my questions are: what is the community like at Monterey? What is the drug culture like? Has it been difficult for you to meet people, have you felt isolated? What is there to do in the area, are there good hikes? Is it walkable/is public transport good; can you get to town relatively easily? Anything else you think might be relevant for me to know?\n\nSorry for the novel of a post. Thanks so much in advance to anyone who takes the time to read or reply!",

            "comment": "I like it tbh. My favorite thing is that class sizes do not get bigger than 30. It\u2019s definitely smaller and more like a community college vibe, so it just depends on what you want. Also campus is very walkable idk who said it wasnt. Theres a bus stop on campus that goes to nearby cities, but I have a car so idk how good it is exactly. Also the nature is gorgeous and tons of outdoor activities!",

            "comment": "First off: community. I\u2019m going to be honest, it\u2019s hard to find friend groups unless you actively look for them. If you don\u2019t go out of your way, it\u2019s real easy to just not meet anyone. The solution I found to this is to join clubs. We have tons of clubs on campus, and it\u2019s pretty easy to make friends if you join a few of those. They\u2019re also pretty fun by themselves. \n\nDrug use: We have way, and I mean WAY less drug use than Humboldt. It\u2019s still present, but not in nearly the same way it is in Humboldt.\n\nHousing: this is kinda tricky, the housing itself is decent, and if you\u2019re living in freshman housing the rooms are much bigger here than at Humboldt, but there have been issues with the pricing of them. Specifically, there was a huge issue with east campus last year. we have a rate lock program that basically means that your housing rates are supposed to never go up from the price they were on the first semester you where on campus. Last year, east campus housing raised its price anyway, against the rate lock, and really fucked over a lot of students. We\u2019re talking rates up to doubling, with very little notice, with the added benefit that they demanded back pay for the increased rate for another month that had already gone by. It was a mess. I personally have lost trust in the rate lock program because of that incident. I\u2019m not sure that the University will do that to main campus housing because east campus is owned by another company, but it did prove that the rate lock doesn\u2019t actually mean a lot. We also have issues with housing shortages, but i understand that Humboldt does to, and I\u2019m not sure which is worse, so that\u2019s probably a neutral point. \n\nWalkability: the campus is extremely walkable. You can get to most of your classes on foot within 10 minutes, with a couple exceptions. If you end up with those exceptions, it\u2019s still not too far, and worse comes to worse you can ride a bike to them in a couple of minutes. It\u2019s also a whole lot less hilly than Humboldt, so that\u2019s a plus.\n\nPublic transport: it\u2019s not bad. You can get to any of the nearby towns, and if you want to go further, if you go to Salinas and catch a long distance bus. The only issue is that you have to go a few miles in any direction if you actually want to get someplace, so don\u2019t expect to walk to any nearby towns except for the shopping center down the road. If I want to get places, I personally like to ride my bike, but I also have a much farther idea of acceptable bike riding distance than most people.\n\nClasses: I don\u2019t know your major so I can\u2019t really tell you about that. What I will say is that all of the professors that I\u2019ve been in class with have been great, and the small classes mean that you are much more able to talk directly with and get to know your professors. \n\nMascot: please, please, PLEASE for the love of god don\u2019t pick your school because of the mascot. That being said, if you like sea otters so much, they do live in the area, and if you go to the shore you might see one from time to time.",

            "comment": "I have a friend from high school who just last semester transferred from Humbolt to Monterey. Long story short he said Humbolt was fantastic for the first year or two because there was a lot to \u201cexperience\u201d, i.e running off into the woods tripping on shrooms, but after he got passed the wanting to explore in college stage it was very hard to find other academically inclined people. That being said, I transferred to MB fall 2021 from CC and Ive had no issue at all making friends. People at MB are for the most part very academically inclined so it can be a little intimidating to talk to people at times but after youre there for a semester or two you\u2019ll start to realize that with a school so small you see a lot of the same people in your classes. This becomes ESPECIALLY prevelant in your upper division classes. \n\nOn the topic of drugs overall I feel mostly the same way, they just really aren\u2019t my thing and partying has never been either, and thats a big reason as to why I picked MB (was also proximity to home and scenery for me). It\u2019s still college though so you can never expect 0, but its extremely low.\n\nNow close knit community is kind of subjective. As I stated before, due to the size of the school its not uncommon to have like 5 people you\u2019ve had in previous classes in your class each semester, but keep in mind that theres not a lot of campus life so you would need to do a bit of digging to find your niche. There are clubs and stuff like that to check out. \n\nLastly, theres the freshman experience. Now I cannot say for sure what exactly its like (assuming youre an incoming freshman) but living in the dorms is apparently pretty polarizing. People either really love it or really hate it. Apparently the dining hall food is pretty crap, and due to the campus location its not like you have a lot of alternatives for food but there is a kind of shopping center a 10 minute walk away with a targer and a couple resturants. Downtown monterey and Pacific grove are also great (and safe) towns to go out for a day in with a bunch of resturants and a few fun places. Also you get a free ticket to the aquarium either once a year or once a semester I cant remember which. Oh and Id STRONGLY reccomend kayaking in Elkhorn slough its incredible, had an otter swim under my kayak and a seal surface next to me and stare at me in the face with its big marble eyes all in the span of 5 minutes. Lastly if you bring binoculars you can do some whale spotting from like 9am-12pm on most days from any of the state beaches but depends on the time of the year. \n\nIf you like nature I\u2019m sure you\u2019d like what MB has to offer but its mostly coastal chapparal whereas humbolt has all the redwoods so a lot more cypress and sage but it has its own charm imo. If you like hiking fort ord national monument has a ton of trailheads and theres even one on the southeast side of campus thats pretty popular. \n\nAlso between you an me, although its stupid\u2026.. I 100% wanted to have a sea otter mascot so bad that was the nail in the coffin of my application. But dont let that be the deciding factor! All in all I think if you went to MB you\u2019d have a great time, and Im not sure what your major is but MB has changed a lot since even 2014, theres a ton of new professors and theyre all extremely eager to share the knowledge they have, havent had a single negative interaction with one yet.",

            "comment": "Housing question. We were told on campus tours \u201c no issue with housing\u201d. Upon further investigation I am seeing estimates of 50% housed but news articles seem to suggest the issue is for older students, graduates, teachers. Can I assume my student will have easy housing options through 3rd year of college? That\u2019s what I am hoping for. I am assuming rent Senior year. Plan B is if no housing Junior year, that\u2019s the study abroad year anyway? Thoughts?? I will say she looked at USD, private in San Diego. Major turn off and reason for us rejecting the school  was no housing Junior and Senior year. The housing market in SDiego is very tight and extremely expensive. Looking at comparable places, rooms in Monterey coastal area reflects a much lower rental cost. So, I think we are on the right track here. Would appreciate thoughts.",

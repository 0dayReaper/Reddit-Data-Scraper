Yeah pretty much everyone is freaking out right now and there\u2019s plenty of empty shelves at stores, but people tend to panic easily and hoard/stockpile at any sign of trouble. Local Hartnell College had a student evaluated for it, but tested negative. There haven\u2019t been cases in Monterey County. In nearby San Benito County, two residents were diagnosed and have since recovered. It seems relatively low-threat here tbh.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to ridicule people who are genuinely afraid or have been sick, but it does feel like this year\u2019s buzzword (like the swine flu years ago). Until there\u2019s a real, solid case on campus or in town, campus will probably stay open.",

    "postText": "I'm considering applying in October this year to attend CSUMB in the fall of 2023, in the school psych masters program. If anyone is part of this program, can you tell me how difficult it was to get in? What GPA did you have if you were admitted? I just graduated from UCSC with a psychology BA. My GPA was pretty average, not amazing but not bad either (around 3.2 to 3.3). Also, did you have to take the GRE? I know there were other tests listed in the program admission requirements (CBEST, CSET) but I wasn't sure about the GRE specifically.",

            "comment": "Hi! I\u2019m a part of Cohort 7, and this is my first year in the School Psych program. \n\nThe cohort sizes are small, only 15-18 students per cohort, which makes it a bit competitive. I had a GPA of 3.87, a BA in psychology from the Ohio State University, and I wasn\u2019t a first pick. I did not have to take the GRE, but I don\u2019t know if that requirement has changed. Finish all the requirements they ask you to complete before submitting your application. It is doable, and it makes you a more viable candidate (CBEST, Livescan, First Aid/CPR training, etc.). \n\nDiversity and having an open mind is extremely important here, as well as real world experience. One of my weaknesses was that I didn\u2019t have a lot of experience working in education systems/schools. If you are able to get a job as a teacher\u2019s assistant, a substitute teacher, or anything like that, do so and put that on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 even if it\u2019s only a couple months. Be willing to challenge your perceptions and self-analyze. If you can do any research or familiarize yourself with English language learners, special education, intersectionality, and cultural sensitivity, it will really benefit you if you get to the interview stage.\n\nThe program is a mix of in person and online, leaning towards in person. In person classes are mandatory, and you cannot skip them. So far mine have been held every other week with either a zoom or asynchronous portion on the weeks we don\u2019t meet up face-to-face. \n\nHope that was helpful! Feel free to ask me more questions! :)",

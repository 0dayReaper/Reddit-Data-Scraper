    "postText": " Hello fellow Otters!\u00a0 I am a new transfer student coming this fall.\u00a0 I am interested in restarting eSports Club.\u00a0 Please share any information you have in the comments below.\u00a0 I would also appreciate feed back on the following;  \n \n\nI have already contacted ICC and SCC.\u00a0 eSports Club used to be ICC.\u00a0 I  believe we could move into the SCC as eSports is an emerging varsity sport for small universities and colleges across the nation.\u00a0 While eSports is unlike traditional athletic sports, I have found that some of the same concepts apply.\u00a0  Dedication to improvement.\u00a0 Maintaining a healthy body and mind.\u00a0 Practice, practice, practice.  And, Teamwork.  \n \n\nI have contacted an intercollegiate eSports organization for membership requirements.\u00a0 I am looking for more organizations like the NACeSports organization so I can see which one would fit our school best and provide a range of competitive games that our fellow students play.\u00a0 Let me know what games you play and what organizations you have heard of.  \n \n\nWe will have many individuals and groups competing in different events but we will conduct ourselves as one team; we will train together, learn from one another, host resident and intercollegiate tournaments, provide entry level experiences, and entertainment for our fellow students interested in watching and supporting their classmates.  \n \n\nOur campus is incredibly beautiful, and I want to foster a gamer culture that plays hard outside and inside.\u00a0 eSports Club will encourage members to maintain good grades and enjoy our surroundings.  I know from personal experience that an active lifestyle can be very beneficial to competitive gamers.  eSports club will encourage physical training and outdoor activity as a staple part of our goal to become a true sports club and a strong team.  \n \n\nI want eSports Club at CSUMB to be all inclusive.\u00a0 I want divisions  within the club to be based on what games or genre people play and skill levels.\u00a0 One varsity team per game and one or more teams below that depending on the amount of players and skill levels and competitions we can support.\u00a0 No gendered teams, no handicap teams, just students striving to compete at their best, together.  \n \n\nA little about me; I\u2019m an ESTP major Applied Ecology focus.\u00a0 I  primarily play real time strategy games like  StarCraft II and Age of Empires II.  I developed a strategic and competitive mind set at a young age playing chess and athletic sports.  My father and I would play chess for hours after a long day of working outside or enjoying outdoor activities.  I  found that video games gave me an outlet that was a fun past time and a constructive way to unwind.  I have been watching the rise in popularity of eSports and have wanted to contribute to the continued growth by supporting others.\u00a0 I love watching and playing sports because it brings  people together for something fun.  I also enjoy rock climbing, football, soccer, hiking, fishing, hunting and camping.  \n \n\nI am incredibly excited to join the community!\u00a0 I look forward to any critical comments, votes and feedback.\u00a0 PM me if you want to help or get involved in the 'club'.  Our goal is to become a team.  \n \n\nTLDR; eSports Club may become the schools eSports Team!",

    "postText": "So as the title implies, I'm interested in applying to CSUMB. I'm not really sure about which program to apply to though. I've got three in mind, and I was wondering if anyone would be willing to give any sort of feedback/commentary on what I have to say about any one of them\n\n**Marine Science:** The Monterey area seems to (pretty obviously) be a great hub for marine studies. I'm passionate about ecology, and I know that it plays at least a decent roll in the curriculum. If I joined this program, I feel like I would also be inclined to get a master's degree  \n**Computer Science:** I'm taking the second year of AP Comp Sci right now, so I've covered the very basics of JavaScript and Java, but that's about it. In terms of passion, I think it's alright and can be fun but I feel like I don't understand it well enough to gauge if I'm super into it like I know some people are  \n**Cinematic Arts &amp; Technology:** I'm pretty passionate about movies, but I have several reservations about this one. The biggest is job security. Could this actually go somewhere or is it just one of those degrees that you graduate with and can't do anything else with? Another one is I don't have a whole lot of experience. I've never been apart of a serious video-production before. I also don't have any editing skills/experience. I do have some acting experience though, and I'm good with cameras (angles, lighting, framing, I have a good eye for all of them)\n\nPlease let me know if you or anyone you know was apart of any of these programs. Or (as it's pretty obvious my interests are wide spread) if you're in a program you really love at CSUMB just comment about it, I'd love to hear about it.",

            "comment": "I have a friend that majored in Marine Science and now is in graduate school for film! You could take some film classes to fulfill a GE requirement or pick a major you like the most and minor in your second favorite option. I am a marine science major with a minor in environmental science. I love ecology as well and marine science program is great for that path. I would say look at biology or environmental science also and determine if you want to focus on genetics or conservation/management. From my experience going through the program, the two routes most students  take are either research in whatever interests them (look into UROC) or conservation/management programs that offer volunteer/training positions like Monterey bay aquarium, Land bureau management, moss landing mammal center, and tons more in the area. It took until my final year to figure out what I want to study (coastal ecosystems specifically estuaries) but that\u2019s just the journey of college which is figuring out what you like and don\u2019t like. Also; don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help from professors/advisors/ and researching out to program coordinators. Everyone at CSUMB (at least in science department) has been super helpful to me.",

            "comment": "I'm a comp sci student here so my bias would say go for comp sci. The comp sci department at this campus is established and I've learned a lot from data structures fluency to creating android apps and webapps, using various apis and understanding endpoints all in the first year of being at this campus. So I can say with confidence that you will learn a lot of you try here.\n\nMarine science, I wouldn't know particularly but the biology/environmental science stuff at this college is where it's at, lots of competition academically wise and big classes.\n\nCinema arts: the arts department at this college doesn't really seem to be established much, but I don't really see or meet any of those majors. Imo I wouldn't waste my time.\n\nP.S. it would be a good idea to check those programs at this college on their website. If you take a look at what classes are required to get a degree in one of the three you can really see what you'll be learning and thus getting out of your degree. It's the knowledge you learn not the piece of paper that will push you further\n\nHope this helps!",

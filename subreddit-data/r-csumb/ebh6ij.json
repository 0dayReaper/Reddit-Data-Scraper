It could also mean they need an updated copy of your transcripts to accept you. You could probably get in touch with admissions and have them look into exactly what they need.",

I also transferred in and had everything ready; I was set to graduate from my community college and had already been accepted to CSUMB. A little later, I was told that I was in danger of having my admission revoked and my graduation postponed since I was \u201cshort 3 units\u201d. To make a long story short, I showed the educational plan I had made with my counselor (which he signed) and all of the paperwork and was able to secure my admission. Same thing here; make a plan, get it signed, have copies available, and double check it with an advisor or yourself via the requirements for your major. Document everything, have multiple copies, and show signatures because at the end of the day, your education and time matters to you but it won\u2019t matter as much to anyone not directly affected. I hate to sound so pessimistic, but it\u2019s so easy to get screwed over. Anyways, best of luck to you! :)",

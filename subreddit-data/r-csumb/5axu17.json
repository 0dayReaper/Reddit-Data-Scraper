I do agree that a competitive application doesn't really matter that much at CSUMB and that the lower acceptance rates are likely due to lack of housing and classrooms. If you look at admissions trends, the school tends to grow, reach max capacity (causing acceptances to fall), build a new housing project (NQ 2007?, Promontory 2015) then grow again. I'd bet the acceptance rate will go up again once the school builds the new student center, kicks even more kids out of housing to make room for freshmen, and builds another housing project. \n",

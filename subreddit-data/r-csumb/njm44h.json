I have taken CART 200 (intro to filmmaking), 260 (Experimental Sound), and 295 (Art of the Pitch) and it is really amazing. You have to remember that csumb is a new school built around 20 years ago so the film program is still grow but they do have alot of neat stuff. I haven't been on campus but I heard they have a studio, red cameras, and editing studio. The professors are in the industury and they can help you get a foot in there if you make connections with them. Fall 2021 I am taking more film classes but so far this program seems way better than sac state imo. I would highly recommend it. Also, you make film what it is. Don't expect handouts if you want to be in the film industry you need to make things on your own and start learning on your own. It is nice to have teachers teaching you but they can't help you if you don't show that passion with your work.",

Being involved in film has been a lifelong dream and I just got sick of working my ass off for someone else's dream instead of my own. Appreciate your input, thank you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh also do you know if there is availability to do school on campus right now or is everything virtual?",

I tell them I am not worried about finding a job they will come but I want do film because I have an urge to make stories that people need to hear and I don't want to major in something where at my graduation I regret doing you know. CSUMB compared to like ucla is different but as long as you put in the work it won't matter because your work will show for you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor your second question as of right now they are doing a hybrid of both where basically they are offering in person classes and online classes. For my CART 230 which is art of storytelling they are offering both in person and online classes. Though because of co-vid it won't be a full classroom like around 50% from what my prof told me. I am sure that in spring of next year we hopefully be back in person.",

I'm only 28 but i've learned that money comes and goes...it doesn't really matter what you are doing so do what you will be proud of! Love it, wish all the best to you! Maybe one day we will meet down the line! \n\nI will keep looking in to the school, let me know if you have additional tips or anything for getting good scholarships or anything at all! My wife and I have been wanting to move down to that area so it sounds like a very exciting prospect.",

I don't mind living with a roomate but what accommodations have the best mix of being sociable but also nice to actually live in? I was looking at a double room at Promontory but because it's an accommodation that's reserved for students with more than 120 credits I'm a little worried it's just gonna be 3rd/ 4th year students who are always busy.\n\nIn Residence Halls are all the students freshmen? Because I'll be a little older so I was hoping to live in accommodations with a mix of age groups instead of being just with freshmen or just older students.\n\nAny advice is really helpful! Oh and also I'm trying to meet as many people there as possible so if anyone wants to hang out when I arrive that would be great lmao",

            "comment": "Hey there! Promontory is mainly transfer students with more than 60 units. East Campus is reserved for students with more than 120 units, or are 21 years of age or older, or are living with families. I am a transfer student who applied for promontory and east campus\nmainly, but I toured the campus last month. A lot of the residence halls are freshman and sophomore students. Promontory was easily the nicest, and the residence halls were not bad, but nothing to write home about. I did not tour East Campus, but I did drive through the area and it\u2019s quaint and well maintained from what I could tell. \n\nHowever, since you are an exchange student you may qualify for promontory. I do not think you will be accepted for East Campus, as the requirements are a bit higher and you need to be 21 at the time of application. I would definitely contact the hosing office and see what your options are since you are an exchange student though!",

They said I'm allowed to apply for Promontory (and the other international excchange student coming from my Uni could apply for it) but for some reason the option to put it down doesnt come up in my appliccation. I emailed the housing team about it so hopefully they fix it soon so I can apply soon.\n\nI'm not planning to apply for East Campus anyway because I want to be on campus to walk easily since I won't have a car either. Did you see North Quad at all? I want to be able to hang out with a mix of people so not just freshmen or 3rd years and exchange students. I'm good at making friends so I just want to be in a social halls you know?\n\nDo you have any idea how easy it is to get around without a car too? Like for grocery shopping and stuff like that if I don't get a meal plan? Or would having a meal plan be worth it if I don't have a car and the public transport isnt good?",

I don\u2019t get my assigned housing until later this month, at least that\u2019s what they had emailed me. I did see North Quad! It was decent, but I would much prefer Promontory over it, as they are newer and more spacious. I totally get the social aspect of it, that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been looking at clubs already!!\n\nAs for getting around: the campus is very spaced out. Everything is within walking distance, but because the campus is so spacey, a bike makes it easier to get around. For grocery shopping, I believe they don\u2019t have anything that\u2019s close by. The campus is located in Seaside and is actually about a 10-15 min drive away from Monterey. With student ID, you get free bus transport around the city though! I\u2019m going to bite the bullet and purchase a meal plan as I don\u2019t want to have worry about making food all the time, and just focus on my studies. To me, the trade off is worth it! I like to cook, but it\u2019s hard to find time to eat healthy when you are busy.",

Because I'm considering applying for a single room in strawberry since aparently it's better than the other north quad options. If not I think I'll apply for residence halls because the housing team still haven't fixed the issue for me not being able to apply for Promontory and I'm not keen on waiting for much longer.\n\nFree buses sound awesome so hopefully it's easy to use them and get round. I doubt I can afford a car for a year so a bike sounds like a good idea. Thanks for the help and maybe see you around in August!",

You didn\u2019t mention North Quad which I think has the most diverse range of age groups, but honestly I think they\u2019re not the most appealing option. Promontory is wayyy nicer. The doubles are really tight and small but it might work out well since you won\u2019t have a ton of stuff. My vote is always avoid north quad but if you\u2019re looking for the most diverse age range, north quad is definitely it",

Is it that expensive/ difficult to do my own shopping (especially without my own car)? Is the cafeteria food actually alright?\n\nWhat accommodation have you stayed in?",

There is a target a mile away which isn\u2019t a bad walk, but would be harder when carrying a lot. I\u2019d recommend getting a bike if you don\u2019t have a car, and ride the bus as well. Campus food isn\u2019t great, they\u2019ve gotten a lot of complaints this year and I think they\u2019re actually trying to improve and this semester has gotten a bit better. School food was quite good before Covid so I think it\u2019ll get better. I\u2019ve only lived in the freshman dorms, I\u2019m a resident advisor. But I frequently stay with my boyfriend in prom which is lovely, really big and spacious. I have visited friends everywhere though and strawberry is definitely better than the other north quad options, so I think that\u2019s probably what you\u2019d want. It\u2019s also a bit closer to main campus than prom so walking for campus food wont be bad at all",

    "postText": "Hey! \nI\u2019m a first year student currently studying biology in Scotland.  My university offers a lot of study abroad opportunities in many different universities around the world and I\u2019m considering doing a semester in CSUMB.  I was wondering if you have any advice on what life is like for foreign exchange students or any insight what the social life is like studying in an American college.  The extent of my knowledge spans as far as legally blonde 1&amp;2... Im excited to study abroad, but I\u2019m a bit worried about fitting in, I\u2019ve heard that some American colleges can be quite cliquey.  If anyone could enlighten me it would be greatly appreciated :)",

            "comment": "Hey I'm a british exchange student here at the moment doing a full year. \n\nI'll start with the cons. The campus here is a lot quieter than what you're used to at home. If you dont have a car or a generous friend then it can be quite difficult to leave campus and there isn't a lot to do on campus so the weekdays can get pretty boring and tedious. Like I really cant stress enough the campus is in the middle of nowhere if you dont have a car. The classes in america as a whole are also very different. Most of your grade is based on weekly homeworks and assignments and a pass is 70% compared to 40 back in the uk. 20% of your grade is also just on attendance and the teachers take missing class a lot more seriously than in the UK. However, the work is a lot easier and really all you have to do is show up, which is why it can get a bit tedious at times. Drinking culture here also isn't that popular but if you like smoking weed then that's the go to for most students here.\n\nThere are a lot of pros tho. It is pretty easy to do a lot of travelling around the west coast while you are here. If you pick your classes well you can end up with long weekends and make the most of it by travelling somewhere in California or even another state. I've been here for just over 2 months and I've been to Santa Cruz, san Jose, yosemite, pinnacles san Francisco and even New York. It gives you the opportunity to visit all these places quite easily (as long as you save up before you come as everything in america is really expensive). The weather here is also great. It's not that good in august/beginning of september but late September and october it's pretty consistently like nearly 20 degrees - today I was walking round in a t shirt. The sunsets here are crazy and there are a lot of beaches to chill at as well.\n\nI'm sure I'm missing a load of stuff so feel free to dm me any questions, hope this was helpful for you",

The closest thing to legally blonde is the amount of time we\u2019re all spending time in the library! Of course there are some parties, but nothing wild. \nThe university is located on a beautiful part of the California coast. There is so much this university and area has to offer.",

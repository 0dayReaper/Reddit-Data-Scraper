PICK YOUR MAJOR YEAR ONE AND TALK TO A FUCKING GRADUATION COUNSELOR.\n\nThis whole thing about, 'you can wait to pick your major' is total bull shit. The number one thing that keeps people from graduating on time is their sophomore year class choices. People think they can fuck around and take random shit. Then come graduation, you find out you are missing a semester of foreign language or something.  \n\nAnyways, it is a great school. Try to get Karen Wisdom as your English professor, she is incredible, as is Naseem and Poethig. If you know your major, I can give you a list of professors to avoid/ take. \n\nAlso, CSUMB is a great study abroad school. tuition is so low that you can study at expensive schools for 1/10th the cost.

It was about half the size when I was there, but still. Find something you can enjoy doing on your own.\n\nOther than that, I really loved the school. It was great when I went there, the size was small enough you could get a lot of help from professors. What major are you taking? What kind of profession do you want to get into?",

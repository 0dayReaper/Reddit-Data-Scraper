            "comment": "If you go to csumb.edu/clubs you'll find links to the sports club council and the inter-club council. You'll also see a link to a list of clubs (csumb.edu/clubs/club-directory). That list might be a bit out of date, so you should also click on the link to community.\n\nCommunity is the organizational platform that the clubs use, so you'll be able to search all the active clubs there. Unfortunately community is a pain in the ass to use, so don't stress if you can't find what you are looking for there. \n\nFinally, during the first couple weeks of school there will be tabling events and all the clubs will be out in the main quad. So you can talk to people there. That is probably where you will find the clubs you want to join.  This sub is very inactive so I would not count on getting concrete recommendations from it. \n\nOutside of hobby clubs (like anime club) and sport clubs, you'll probably want to check out the clubs specific to your major. I know the Marine Science club hosts a lot of interesting seminars and volunteer events. There is an organization called Return of the Natives (RON) that grows lots of native plants and organizes community planting events among lots of other related things.",

I really enjoyed mine (outdoor recreation/education/admin) you will meet awesome people who can help point you on the right direction.  Also check out REI in marina they have clubs and classes that meet regualarly everything from kayaking to mountain climbing.\n \nAnd i'll third RON as a great organization you dont have to be a member you can just show up to events and they will provide tools and knowledge.",

            "comment": "Join the CSUMB Disc Golf Club!! We had some great Lady Otters come out of CSUMB Disc Golf and some are still competing on the professional level!\n\nIt's also a great way to meet people, get outside, see some really cool areas around Monterey and across California. We would even go on road trips and play against other schools across the country.\n\nIt's challenging and can be competitive or casual depending on your skill level and how into it you want to get. Some of my best friends to this day I met through Disc Golf at CSUMB. There is even a class that fulfills the PE credit.\n\nIf you have more questions feel free to ask!",

I figure if you can afford a better program, go for it. If you\u2019re like me, looking for something affordable but of  quality CSUMB should serve you well.",

            "comment": "I was accepted and declined for several reasons:\n\n1. ACCSB accreditation (at the time they were still \"in process\" of getting it.  This is really needed on your record and when you go to employers .\n2. Cost - you can get the same degree from University of North  Alabama - which has the AACSB  for around $19,000 vs the $40,000+ that CSUMB is charging for the same piece of paper.\n3. Ability to pick an emphasis for your MBA or get a micro-crendential is lacking.  This is really critical. A general MBA is going to be as useful in today's market.  Again, I decided to go with University of North Alabama because they have 9 different emphases to pick, and several micro credentials if you want to do that as well, and the cost, even if you did two empahses+ a micro credential is still less than CSUMB.\n4. Length of time school has been in operation- CSUMB for business is relatively new compared to Alabama.  UNA was one of the first online business schools, and the institution itself is from the 1800s, and has both the regional accreditation and AACSB.\n5. Flexibility.  CSUMB has you on a \"track\" which they really prefer you do not deviate from.  You can't take one class ahead of another one, if you need to take 2 semesters off you probably will get dropped, etc.  UNA is not like that.  You can go all year round (summer, winter, spring) or you can choose which quarter to attend - (they have 5 quarters - 2 in spring, and 2 in fall, and 1 in summer).  You can take up to 3 classes per quarter (though that might be crazy if you work, most people do 1-2).\n\nWhen I thought about all those things it was a no brainer to not go to CSUMB and instead attend UNA, even though the people were nice and the mascot is cute at CSUMB.   I'm halfway through my UNA degree and am happy with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm pretty sure their \"new start scholarship\" is still going - meaning there is no application fee, and one of the intro classes that is mandatory is free (so that saves you around $1000).\n\nYou can look into UNA here:\n\n[https://una.edu/business/index.html](https://una.edu/business/index.html)\n\n[https://una.edu/mba/index.html](https://una.edu/mba/index.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI assume you came up with CSUMB because you were looking for something that was 100% online (maybe in California?) that is how I found it, but then I started really aggressively shopping around and came up with UNA.  Other ones which were also enticing were Texas A&amp;M (which is around I think $14k), Oklahoma State, and University of Wyoming.  \n\nShop around first....",

I\u2019m part of research, I\u2019m going to grad school conferences, I\u2019m shadowing for PhD programs through clubs. I\u2019m not saying your opinion isn\u2019t valid, but maybe I\u2019ve been lucky w my professors, counselors and tutors so far..\n\nEdit: I had gotten into SF and that was not a great place to major in psych. So impacted and felt kinda like a number. I love the curriculum here. I feel like they\u2019re prepping me well for higher education.",

The one at CSUSM is more focused on industrial/organizational psych which is not what I want to do. I hope I can find research opportunities here. I'm hoping this will be a fresh start for me. Anyways fellow transfer, if you need a study buddy or someone to navigate this place hit me up :)",

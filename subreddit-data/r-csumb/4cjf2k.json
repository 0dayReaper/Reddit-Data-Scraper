I had a casual interview and explained that I had no experience teaching or tutoring, but I liked helping people in general and that tutoring would improve my proficiency in the subjects I tutored (several business classes).",

            "comment": "The hiring process is underway, so first apply through Otter Jobs today. Talk to the instructor for the course you want to tutor as soon as you can, because ASAP will be asking them what they think of you. If they don't really know you yet, it's not too late to introduce yourself. If you don't talk to them at all, you're at a disadvantage. Plan to tell the instructor why you want to tutor their class and why you want to tutor in general and (protip) ask the instructor what's important to them in a tutor for their subject. \n\nIt's pretty competitive, but a great job if you can get it - especially if you want to learn a lot about teaching and get good letters of rec later on.",

I don't know the instructor too well and I don't have any paid work experience, tutoring experience (which says is a requirement on OtterJobs), or even a resume. I don't like my odds, but I guess it can't hurt to construct a resume, apply, and see where it goes from there. I'll look into tutoring over the summer and contact the prof to help my chances for applying next year as well.\nI appreciate the insight, thank you!",

It's really not too late to introduce yourself to the prof and tell them you're interested. Maybe they're looking for someone just like you! I mean, just wanting to work at ASAP suggests that you could be a good fit. \n\nI know the folks who do the hiring for science tutors, so if you want any more info on that, feel free to PM me. ",

Put together a short resume and cover letter outlining any experience you may have with the topic you are applying for. If you are wanting to be a writing tutor maybe include some writing samples. Be ready for an interview, dress appropriately (no flip-flops and ripped up jeans). You might even stop in at ASAP (or whatever they are calling themselves these days) and talk to a tutor in the area you are interested in. ",

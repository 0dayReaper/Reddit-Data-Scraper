    "postText": "eSports are rising in popularity and organizations and leagues are cropping up to support college students who want to play competitively against other teams in their favorite games.  \n\nI wanted to share this site and [this page in particular](http://cstarleague.com/csgo/universities/1334) which is the page for what I hope will become CSU Monterey Bay's CS:GO team. The site also hosts leagues for LoL, DoTA2, and StarCraft II for those who are interested. \n\nI know this is a small subreddit but I hope that someone will find this interesting, especially CS:GO players since that's the only game out of the list that I play. If anyone is interesting in forming a team for the school, or knows someone who might be (preferably DMG+), please get involved and contact me.",

I have never sought out help because I don't want to be given a shitload of medication and my social anxiety has prevented me from seeking help. I saw a few groups that meet up for students who have issues. Have any of you joined?",

It's not just talking about what's going on, we also did small activities like a starting relaxing mediation, coping methods and creating personal goals. It was worth it. If that doesn't help, you can always go for individual sessions.",

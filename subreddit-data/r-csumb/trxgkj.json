There are parties in east campus housing, but I never lived out there so I can't speak of their quantity and quality, but the few I did attend were pretty tame. The nightlife in surrounding towns is pretty bad.\n\nThere are a ton of student clubs for a variety of things.\n\nIf you can drive there are a ton of fun places within day trip range. If you like Ocean activities and nature, those are the primary things to do in biking range.",

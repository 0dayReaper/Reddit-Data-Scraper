Boilerplate CS courses that have nothing to do with my concentration I'm forced to take while there's shit like CST 321 - Game Design and Interactive Media I, CST 323 - Character Design, CST 322 - Environment Modeling, CST 422 - Level Design go untouched. I'm told that I would have to pay extra to Minor into my fucking concentration and get the education I'm paying for in the first place.\n\nSenior year, I've taken 1 (arguably 2) Game Development courses so far with 1 more to go. It's a scam.",

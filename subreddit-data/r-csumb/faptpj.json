Your best bet would be to either have two doubles in the 2 or 4 singles in the 4 if you want to room with just these people, I don't believe they would be willing to partially fill a 4 for you.\n\nSource: worked at facilities for 40 hours a week over summer and spend probably about 100 hours in promontory moving furniture out of every. single. room.",

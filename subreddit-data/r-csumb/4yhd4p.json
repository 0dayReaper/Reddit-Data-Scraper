I looked at the schedule on the dashboard and I didn't see anything.\n\nDoes anyone know what's up with this? I don't want to go on Friday and find out I can't move in.",

They said something about Panetta Institute students living there so I'm guessing that the RAs might've not had time to check the room and clear it for new use. If you live on second floor, I'd suggest calling to see if your room is affected.",

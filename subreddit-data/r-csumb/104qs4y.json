    "postText": "I'm a possible upcoming freshman for fall 2023 and was wondering on a couple questions.\nHow is the Marine Science program?\nHow is housing for freshmens? \nIs there activities to do during a break?\nHow is the scuba diving club? \nCan you live on campus for winter break?\nAnd overall opinions on CSUMB?\nWhat is the out of state tuition for a single year?\nSorry if it is a lot, I just want a general idea of the school. I know there isn't any parties which doesn't really bother me but was just wondering what do people do during the weekend or in general. I know everyone is unique and such so awnser will vary. Thank you all",

            "comment": "I was there for my year abroad and there are parties, just not as big as I\u2019m used to and they often get shut down or finish kinda early. Big sur is only like 30 mins away so that\u2019s pretty cool, and the beach is walking distance for drinking/smoking in the evening. Lots of places to hike, mountain bike or surf nearby, and Santa Cruz isn\u2019t far. A few sports at the uni but not tons, not sure about societies but that didn\u2019t seem like a big thing.\n\nI was on east campus and value for money is great; it\u2019s one of the cheapest but it\u2019s super nice. Biiit of a trek to campus (30 mins walk, 10-15min cycle from where I was, but I was on the closer end), and there\u2019s a shuttle but it\u2019s super unreliable, but it was fine generally. it was just coming back from main campus parties or if I wanted to go home for lunch and then go back to campus that it got annoying.\nIf you can spend more promontory is by far the nicest, then probably north quad, then residential halls",

I\u2019ve got friends who did it and found it pretty good to, and the biology modules I did definitely felt the most substantial.",

            "comment": "I am an HDFS major so I don\u2019t know a lot about marine science other than we are known for it but I can help answer your general questions! \n\n- housing is required for all freshman and sophomores. It\u2019s nice and has suite style bathrooms, so you don\u2019t have to leave your room to use the bathroom or shower. Some of the rooms are definitely outdated but in my experience the schools pretty good at maintaining them when you ask them. \n\n- I don\u2019t know a lot about a diving club but we do have scuba classes that you get credit for and my friends LOVE it just hard to get into. \n\n- I can\u2019t speak for next year but yes for this year,housing was free during winter and available :) there is nothing really going on during break on campus though. \n\n- I don\u2019t know the price for out of state, but check out WUE since the school does accept that scholarhsip program and it will make out of state pricing cheaper if you are living in a participating state. \n\n- personally for me I\u2019m from a bigger city that Seaside ( like triple the size in people) so it has been a hard adjustment because I was so use to things happening around me but here you have to find your own fun which is 100% possible with being near the beach and being in a tourist town, just you need to be proactive. I love riding the bus to the wharf and going to the aquarium. We have some pretty good sea food as well. Having a car is SO useful, not essential but it will make the experience 10 times better. Freshman\u2019s can have cars since you can visit more places. \n\nbest of luck picking a school :)",

            "comment": "This was my first semester at csumb as a transfer student and it was ok. I did come from a larger city in so cal going from a lot of stuff to do to not that much was an adjustment forsure. If you like hiking scenic views it\u2019s a nice area to live in. Freshman housing is not great, typically 3 freshman to one room but it\u2019s on campus so won\u2019t have to walk or bike far. Overall opinion I personally would not come here as a freshman. Having a car is so useful in Monterey, the bus lines for school were getting cut before break not sure what is going on with that now. There\u2019s a couple bars in downtown Monterey if youre old enough and looking for nightlife but other thank that it\u2019s typically pretty quiet in the area. On the weekends I typically go grocery shopping or go see some views! But there\u2019s nothing crazy to do compared to big cities like LA or SF",

I came here my freshmen year and I transferred out because of the experiences i\u2019ve had there. a few of my friends who are still there applied to transfer out of there as well. while you get a shared bathroom/shower (if you\u2019re in area 2) or a private (in area 1), there were so many plumbing issues and no one would answer my roommates and i\u2019s questions. we were relocated for the majority of fall 2021 and maintenance kept ignoring us to the point where our parents almost had to get involved. on top of that, they do not take title ix reports seriously. after one person being reported and there was \u201cnothing they could do about it,\u201d the school held events during sexual assault awareness month and that was a slap in the face. their mental health services are absolutely horrible and i\u2019ve heard of multiple people being placed on hold during a mental health crisis. don\u2019t get me started on their dining commons either, it\u2019s gross and all my friends have gotten food poisoning at least once.",

            "comment": "Seems like your questions have been answered but just to provide input from a different perspective: I transferred to MB last semester and live off campus, and nearly all my neighbors are CSUMB alumni. As a transfer I absolutely love it and thats been pretty common consensus among all the other transfers I\u2019ve talked to, but the perception from day one students who came out of high school is drastically different. I know you said you dont care about parties, but whatever expectations you had lower them even further. I love how quiet the area is because I came from San Jose, but a lot of freshman expecting the \u201ccollege experience\u201d from MB were dramatically dissapointed at the lack of campus life. Additionally I\u2019ve really only heard pretty negative things about living on campus, but that being said it is slowly getting better. Like I said before my neighbors all graduated from MB between 2015 and 2018, and its clear the last few years have seen drastic improvements across every aspect of the campus. \n\nIm an ENVS major, but a lot of my course load overlaps with marine science and the professors for both ENVS and Marine Science are incredible people with tons of experience. A lot of them are new to the campus (within the last few years) but I haven\u2019t had one interaction with a mentor that hasn\u2019t been positive outside of one very infamous math professor. Additionally theres a lot of opportunities with professors and surrounding organizations in Marine science so long as you\u2019re actively searching for them.",

                            "comment": "Her name is holly swift, shes apparently fantastic for her actual field (marine science) but STAT 250 (already considered one of the hardest stem courses on campus) is just made worse by her, shes apparently very arrogant and extremely unhelpful when it comes to teaching stats. The advisors here are great though so Im sure they would tell you the same, Tracy Ramirez is the other stat 250 teacher and Im taking her now, shes fantastic but the cirriculum is still pretty difficult for a variety of reasons. Would love to catch you up on it if u had any other questions\n\nAlso, there may not be a lot to do in Monterey but places like Capitola and santa cruz are less than an hour away. Capitola can get pretty touristy bc the beaches are probably the best for spending the day on but point is its not like theres nothing to do over breaks or weekends. Youre also an hour 15 mins away from san jose and in my experience a lot of people you meet will invite you to check out their home towns over break so theres definitely social experiences to be had",

If you want a solid Marine Sci, you have to be in a coastal place, and it's prob the best deal (financially) \n Lots of great internships and collaborations with Monterey Bay Research Institute, Stanford (Hopkins Statio), Moss Landing Marine lab, etc. Once you get SCUBA certified, the Marine Sci kids go out diving fairly the time -",

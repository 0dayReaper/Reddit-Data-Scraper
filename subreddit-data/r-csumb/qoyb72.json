I haven\u2019t really heard anything about it being a \u201claughing stock\u201d and the local mental health companies seem to like taking in grads. I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s\u2026 a bit messy, and sometimes class scheduling is a nightmare. I will say that you get a lot of support when it comes to internships/field placements, though. All in all, my experiences have been mostly positive so far.",

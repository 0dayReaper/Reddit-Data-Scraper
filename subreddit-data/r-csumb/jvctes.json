            "comment": "So you can participate if you \u201cidentify\u201d as heterosexual but you aren\u2019t really? Or like what if you are a gay man who currently \u201cidentifies\u201d as a woman and so you \u201cidentify\u201d as a heterosexual woman. This isn\u2019t a very scientific study. How will you ever find out what kinds of differences trans women and women have for example, that would benefit from different kinds of support or unique challenges each may have. You erase that when you lump everyone together. It\u2019s actually harmful to everyone. It delegitimizes anything you find through this cringe PC \u201cstudy\u201d.",

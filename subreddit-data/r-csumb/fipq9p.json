    "postText": "Silly title I know, but I figure I'd get multiple opinions on my decision to leave. For context I am not from this area, I am from SoCal and I plan on going back home in light of the recent news. Ideally I would like to be home until (when) they say classes will resume in person, but I have taken multiple online courses in the past and I know some professors like to do in person testing. Which is why I am hesitant to go home for that long because I would be screwed if I have to show up in person for a test. I was thinking of emailing my professors to see their plan for testing but I don't know if I will have any luck in them knowing their test plans just yet...\n\nSo, should I just go home now until (if) in-person classes resume or just come back after this break ? \n\n(also I know socal has a lot of cases, but I dont have any reasons to stay here and I am an introvert anyways so if I went back home Ill just be in my own room chilling with my cat like 100% of the time )",

Even if you're currently taking an online class that has in-person tests, they'd likely have to change that. I think you should be safe to stay home.\n\nDo remember, labs are still in person for the time being, though, so if you have a lab, that would be an obstacle.",

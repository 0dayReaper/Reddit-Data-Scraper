Sometimes they have cool stuff on there, but I personally have not taken advantage of it yet. It's called \"Swank\" and you can probably find it just by looking that up on the school website. Right now they have stuff like Cloverfield, BlacKkKlansman, Blade Runner, 2001: A Space Odyssey, just to name some of them. It's a bunch of titles that aren't normally on other streaming sites.",

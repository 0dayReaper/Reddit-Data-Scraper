    "postText": "Hello, I'm an incoming student from CSUSM as a psych major. I'm going to live on campus, but I'm still a little nervous about meeting new people due to my age. I'm almost 24 and honestly feel weird living on campus... but it seemed cheaper than the alternative and gas is insane. My friends now keep telling me I should at least try to make friends while I'm here even though I'm mainly focused on graduating as fast as possible along with getting into grad school/work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess what I'm asking is if it's hard to make friends at this commuter school and how I could start? Has anyone else been in my position?",

From my experience coming from San Diego, the culture in the 831 is a bit different, as more people are more introverted, so striking a conversation with a stranger while walking the same direction was almost a no-go lol.  I looked inward within the pocket of my major, especially if I was gonna be in the long haul with a bunch of people together. However, getting involved around campus like joining clubs(which there are plenty, but I barely joined because I wanted to do homework and get my degree in and out quick) helped me get out and make friends outside of the BIT building. Age never really played a factor in making friends as long as you clicked together. Mind you, I was also 24 when I transferred in with the same mentality of \u201cI just want my degree.\u201d I\u2019m gonna tell you right now, that yes getting your degree quick is doable, but doing it solo will burn you out so fast if you don\u2019t have people/community.\n\nWith my second and last year at CSUMB taking place on zoom, my mental, emotional and psych state was in pieces by the end of it all. I wouldn\u2019t have gotten through it with the friends I made in my major and the club I joined right before the lockdown.\n\nLong story short, you\u2019re one of the blessed ones that get to be in person, on campus till you graduate(knock on wood), so make the most out of it. CSUMB is one of those colleges that let you write your story about your experience.",

Tbh the last past 2 years have been shit show so I hope with a clean slate I have a good experience. Maybe I\u2019ll see you on campus.",

            "comment": "Hi!! I moved from SD to MB in 2019! (Went to SD Mesa college) I lived on campus after living with just one room mate in SD. It was a bit of an adjustment, but I had wanted to move up here for the vibe change. Living on campus is lame but kinda like a necessary evil. It\u2019s cheap and close to school. I got lucky with room mates so that helped too. The thing with moving from SD &gt; MB is how damn quiet it is up here. Especially on campus. \nI live in Marina now! I just graduated in December and work in a nearby school. I\u2019m also 24 rn and have a few other friends here who moved from SD if you\u2019d ever want to meet up! \nThe move is all what you make it! But definitely give yourself time to catch the vibe! \nWelcome new otter!",

All my friends came up to me because they saw me playing guitar or saw similar interests. I think most people don't make friends here if I'm being honest, other than getting to know your roommates.\n\nIt also didn't help that freshman year for me was before covid and then I took time off so I lost contact with people. It's a small campus, generally nothing is really ever going on. I mostly stay here for the area because I just got a great job and its beautiful here, Im making most of my friends at my work or outside of school.",

I did commute this recent semester, and as a commuting student, it is definitely somewhat harder to make friends if you are not living on campus. The majority of people I met where through the classes I took, so try to interact with your classmates. Other than that, I hear joining clubs or activities is a great way to meet people",

I don\u2019t mind the online classes if only I could be on campus. I was just really looking forward to having that university experience, even if that experience is a bit limited. I don\u2019t mind that!! I\u2019m starting to like online classes a lot actually. \n\nUgh, I\u2019m just bummed out because i was so excited to make friends, even if I can\u2019t really visit any of them for the time being. It would be nice...\n\nI just wanna get out of this house lmaoo",

Keep contact with group mates you like in groups assignments. Or even amicable teachers. Or reply to this comment, even! (But don't expect a reply until tomorrow.)

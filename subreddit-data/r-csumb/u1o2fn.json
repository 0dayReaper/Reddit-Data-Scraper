My first year on campus I found it hard to find people and join social circles. Then clubs opened up, and I joined a few of those. I would definitely say that it\u2019s the easiest way to meet people and make friends on campus, at least for me. I\u2019m part of the TPO (drama club), Anime club, and the Game Developers Club, all of which are great clubs.",

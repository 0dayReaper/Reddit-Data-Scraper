    "postText": "Hello i'm trying to rescind my enrollment into csumb. The reason im doing so is because of COVID and my parents.\n I emailed them to recind my admissions on april 1 and they said they made a note on my file. But when i logged onto the dashboard today, it still says i'm matriculated for fall. \n\nI sent another email to their admissions email to hopefully have it fixed. But I need to make sure that it's gone as I can't go. If anyone can help me you would be apprecieated. \nI tried calling them but it says their calling  hours are reduced but  i cant find the hours on the website.",

I tried calling them again this morning and all I got is a automated message telling me that their limiting hours, and it hung up on me. So It seems like their not taking their calls.\n\nAgain thank you for answering.",

The exceptions are if you applied for housing, then talk to housing about that, or if you want your enrollment deposit refunded, that's never refunded. If you want to try and fight it, you can try filing for an exception.",

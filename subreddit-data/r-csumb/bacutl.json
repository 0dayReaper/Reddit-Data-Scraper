    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI just visited the campus today for Admitted Otter Day. The visit was OK. The surroundings were beautiful. The students were nice. I honestly felt indifferent when I got here. After I went into the CS presentation narrated by Prof. Sathya Narayanan, I wished I had more questions in mind as well as towards the CS students as well. I talked to Bruns about Data Science and it sounds like something I would like to try out sometime. \n\nIt's going to be a lot, but please bear with me.\n\nI think this sub is perfect to get some more answers about CS and CSUMB in general.\n\n**General Questions:**\n\n* Did you feel like the big fish in the small pond?\n* For those playing in club sports, what type of benefits do you guys usually get? How were you able to organize your club in the first place?\n* What did you want from a university (Ex: Work-Life Balance, Small Classes or Big University, Parties, etc.)?\n\nCS Questions:\n\n* For transfer students, did you find the coursework to be much easier than back at CC?\n* Do you wish you had an engineering department here?\n\n**From what I gathered about CSUMB (How accurate is the list. If there's anymore, feel free to add.):**\n\n* Undergrad size is small which implies that the class sizes are small. You'll have more chances to talk with your professors one-on-one. I dare say that classes aren't going to hard to get.\n* It's next to the beach, it's surrounded by farmland, and it's in Monterey. A very peaceful place to be. It's also home to some of the most prestigious golf courses in the entire nation. Pebble Beach, Del Monte, Spyglass, Bayonet, etc. However, there is no club golf team and I don't know anyone at CSUMB that plays club golf.\n* Since I live in San Jose, I could get a chance to live independent from my parents. \n* I feel like I'm missing some information to make my final decision whether or not I will go to CSUMB. \n* Compared to SJSU, it seems like CSUMB's CS program isn't as established. (You can call me out on this one if you want. In fact I WANT you to).\n* CSUMB does have a sports culture, it's nowhere near the level of NBA or anything like that.\n* There's GIS/Geography-related courses, but there's no major/minor for that.\n* They don't have an Engineering Department.",

            "comment": "I cant help you much but i can give you my honest answer from a friend who has been here at CSUMB majoring CS for 5 years. \n\nHe loves and hates it. Only 6-8 people are graduating this semester and it is growing very gradually. If you want more 1 on 1's with the professor go to CSUMB. \n\nThe school just added in the CS major not too long ago so yeah it isnt completely established. Meaning there is no connections between Central Valley buisnesses or any buisnesses yet. However, i think it will really turn into something great. \n\nOther UC's and CSU's are having impacted courses that it is hard to get 1 on 1's. Instead they have to talk to TA's for help. I got a friend at UCSC and Cal Poly Slo going through this. \n\nPersonal notes im from Fremont transfered from Ohlone College i wanted to be independent as well. And i love it. Only failing one class due to hw being a drag but its whatever. (Majoring in Environmental Studies) \n\nThere is a GIS major kinda it is in the SBS (Social Behaveiroal Science) section. \n\nThere are only 7,000 students attending this school right now.  Most are HCOM majors, Environmental Studies/Science majors, Marine Science, and Buisness. Most are local students aka from watsonville, Castroville, monterey, seaside, marina, and salinas. Tons are from South California and Central Valley, like Bakersfield and Merced. \n\nSorry i cant provide more information about the CS or engineering side but i can still help with alot more general questions except for sports.\n\nGo ahead and PM if you neeed more questions about housing cost or anything else. \n\n\n",

            "comment": "&gt; Did you feel like the big fish in the small pond?\n\nNot really sure about this. It is a small school, but there are lots of opportunities to go beyond your standard academics and do internships or participate in extracurriculars. \n\n&gt; For those playing in club sports, what type of benefits do you guys usually get? How were you able to organize your club in the first place?\n\nI ran the sailing team for a couple years. The sailing was fun, but as a club sport you get no benefits from the school. There is a lot of paperwork and meetings required to run a club, especially on that travels, more so than at many other schools. I got burnt out on that and do not participate in any clubs anymore. \n\n&gt; What did you want from a university (Ex: Work-Life Balance, Small Classes or Big University, Parties, etc.)?\n\nI came to CSUMB looking for small classes, an inexpensive school, and the opportunity to sail. I found all those things. I don't sail anymore, but I got involved in research and through that I learned that I want to go to grad school. With the support of the UROC Scholars program, and my faculty mentor, I applied to Chemistry PhD programs and will be starting at UCSD in the Fall. \n\nIn your first two years it may be hard to get classes because a lot of classes are early major requirements and cross-listed as GE's. That may be changing, we are changing the credits for GE classes soon. \n\nCSUMB does not really have a sports culture. We have a few teams, but very few students go watch games or anything like that. \n\nThe GIS classes are great, and there are lots of opportunities to do research and get internships using GIS. \n\nWe don't have an engineering department, but one will be starting in a few years.\n\nLook into the UROC program. They have lots of resources for finding internships for people. ",

Not many students does not mean that classes are plentiful. \n\nCSUMBs CS program is not established. I went for another program and they are all hit or mis. \n\nCSUMB has a lot of sports going on. I remember playing pick up games at the gym, ording, ect. \n\nCar is a must to get around, as the campus is really an island.",

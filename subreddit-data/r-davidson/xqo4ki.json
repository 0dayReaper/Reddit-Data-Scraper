    "postText": "Hey y'all. You are probably aware that mid-term elections are coming up fast. (Less than 45 days!!) RIGHT NOW is the time to get involved in making sure candidates who will defend reproductive freedom are winning elections. In fact, anti-abortion legislators only need to win a net of three seats in the NC House and two in the NC Senate to override Governor Cooper\u2019s veto of any legislative attacks on our reproductive rights.\u00a0 To make sure this doesn\u2019t happen, Planned Parenthood Votes! South Atlantic is strategically backing candidates in close legislative races with the support of our staff and volunteers. If you're interested in volunteering please fill out this form and we'll get with you to talk about how to get involved.

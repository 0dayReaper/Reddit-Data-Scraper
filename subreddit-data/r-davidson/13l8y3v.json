I\u2019ve already looked over how parking works at Davidson but I would just like to know how difficult it is to get a spot or anything like that or if it\u2019s even worth bringing my car at all. Thanks!",

Most of your necessities are less than a mile from campus. If you need to go to mooresville or huntersville, you'll need to bum a ride or take an uber but I would say most of the things you need day to day are available at places you can walk or ride your bike to. Hope that helps.",

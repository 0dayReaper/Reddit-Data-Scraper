    "postText": "Hi I\u2019m going to apply to Davidson and hopefully one day attend law or graduate school. I\u2019m not sure whether Greek life will be for me. How important are fraternities at Davidson? Do you feel excluded if you don\u2019t join one? Are people in fraternities able to keep their GPAs high enough for law/grad schools? Do the people who don\u2019t join hang out with those who do or is there a big social divide? Thanks.",

I also had non ultimate non frat friends and partied with them too. \n\nIt\u2019s the best place on earth.",

You can work hard to keep your GPA up, and just be involved service and social activities.\n\nHowever, since all parties are open and the Vail Commons is a decent place to eat, you can have a good life without it. With the date weekends, generally some of your Greek friends will be glad to invite you to their Friday activities etc.",

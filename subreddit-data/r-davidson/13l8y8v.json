I\u2019ve already looked over how parking works at Davidson but I would just like to know how difficult it is to get a spot or anything like that or if it\u2019s even worth bringing my car at all. Thanks!",

Also it\u2019s kinda good to have to stay close to campus, I knew some ppl with a car all 4 years and I feel like it hurt them socially cuz they would just drive to places with the same one person all the time instead of hanging out on campus. \n\nIt\u2019s not difficult to get a spot but it\u2019s difficult to get a good spot like in Belk lot.",

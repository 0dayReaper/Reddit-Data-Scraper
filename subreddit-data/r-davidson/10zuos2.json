It's not your fault you attended a small school but you have to take a look outside yourself and realize that #2 out of 3 is way too small a sample size and requires context. A test score gives you context within a large sample size. Best of luck.",

Pretend you're running a 100m race and you came in second of 3. That's great. But without a time you don't have context HOW good a race you ran. Was it a 10 second 100m or a 25 sec 100m race? A standardized test gives you your time and context.",

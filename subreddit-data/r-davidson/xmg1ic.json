    "postText": "Hi Davidson students, alumni, and prospective applicants! As you may or may not have been aware, this sub has been closed down for quite some time. I'm not totally sure why, but the previous lone mod disabled submissions before removing himself, leaving the sub dead with no modteam to revive it. My guess is spambots kinda overran everything and he just got tired of dealing with it--happens to a lot of smaller college subs. \n\nAnyways, the great admins of reddit ended up bestowing this sub upon me, and while I'm quite busy, I'll little by little try to add a banner, some rules, colors, etc. \n\nFirst things first though, post history is clear, settings are reset, and the sub is open!\n\nPlease feel free to ask questions about classes, profs, admissions, sports; or share opinions, links, news, or stories! We aren't a very big school, but I hope this can be an internet hub for our community once again :)",

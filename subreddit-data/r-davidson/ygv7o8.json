Idk about \u201cfinding my tribe\u201d if you\u2019re referring to groups who share those traits, because I\u2019ve never really considered it a central part of my identity and never sought out groups specifically with other adhd/neurodiverse people. \n\nThat being said, i certainly was able to do well even if it did take me longer to do work and I had more late nights working on school than most of my peers. I always felt accepted and made friends in various groups (freshman hall, major classes, pre-med classes, extracurriculars, etc).",

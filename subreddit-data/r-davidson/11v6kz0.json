She seems really sweet. \n\nThere is a lavender lounge for all LGBTQ+ students in Belk dorm - which is freshmen on floors 1-3 and upperclassmen on floor 4.\n\nTurner Eating House (Davidson\u2019s version of sororities) is made up of female and gender non conforming students.\n\nI have only been to visit briefly, so this is all I know. \n\nI\u2019m sure that admissions or leadership at Turner could put you in contact with transgender students open to talking about their experiences at Davidson.",

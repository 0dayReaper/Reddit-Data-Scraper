Some of the football players majored in it because it made keeping your gpa up with so many extra varsity requirements worked well for them.\n\nIf you know some people from football or men's or women's soccer maybe see if they had heard from their academic advisors some good fall classes with below average workload and good gpa average. There may be a class that it is more of a paper class where if you rewrite the paper at the professor's suggestion one generally gets at least a B+ and often an A-.\n\nIt used to be some of these science programs for non science majors were easy too as many could write well but struggled with getting their math requirement in.",

But, there is information about students that want to take gap years *after* being admitted: \n\n\"Yes, and we are big fans of gap year experiences. Approximately 6 students in each incoming class opt to take gap years. An admitted first-year student may, with the permission of the Dean of Admission, defer matriculation for one year. The student must confirm his or her intent to enroll at Davidson, submit the required $1,000 enrollment deposit, and a written request for deferral by May 1. The request must detail the student's plans for the interim year, inclusive of programs, locations and dates. If the deferral request is approved, the student must return a signed deferral contract, coupled with an additional non-refundable deposit in the amount of $1,500, within one week of the notice of approval. First-year students offered admission from the wait list and all admitted transfer students are not eligible to defer.\"\n\nYou may want to reach out to Admissions for clarification.",

So, I think if you just explained the purpose of the gap year in an essay or a letter of recommendation they would just consider your admissions packet as a whole. The admissions director Chris Gruber is really nice. I met him at some of the basketball games. I know his own kids have done things like a junior year abroad. So, I think he especially is open minded. Davidson has always tried to take people with a variety of interests and good character and leadership. Usually, they could  they could improve their test score easily by just taking the truly smartest kids, which Duke supposedly is more inclined to do.\n\nedited for corrections",

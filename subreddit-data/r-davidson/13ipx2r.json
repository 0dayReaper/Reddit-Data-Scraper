    "postText": "The veto override votes have been scheduled in both house and Senate Tomorrow, Tuesday 5/16. \n\nCalls to action for now until tomorrow :\n\nContact these four folks and beg them to not strip us of our basic right to bodily Autonomy. \n\nRep. John Bradford: 919-733-5828 Rep. Tricia Cotham: 919-733-5749 Rep. Ted Davis: 919-733-5786 Sen. Michael Lee: 919-715-2525\n\nWe're not sharing a script and encouraging folks to be kind, but honest, about their opposition. Tell your abortion story if it feels safe. \n\nCall to action for Tuesday: If you can, arrive at NCGA by 3:20 to ensure you can get in, and grab a seat, before 4 PM. \n\nPrepare to be there a while - Don't bring a poster unless your OK leaving it outside the gallery. Water bottles and food is not permitted inside either. \n\nYou will be in good company! Make sure the NCGA doesn't pass this thing quietly and without an audience of the very same people who will vote them out.",

This is in the home I bought to raise our kids in(currently 12 and 7). I have no way of getting my own place till my car is paid for (at least a year away). I am deeply still in love with them both, my exwife is civil but barely talks to me. My exfiance doesn't so much as touch me to give me a hug. But he's at least friendly and talks to me and we laugh at memes together watch youtube while we smoke ect. But I miss them so much, they were my best friends and lovers. Lonely doesn't begin to explain how worthless and undesirable I feel sometimes.",

Sometimes my depression gets so bad if it wasn't for my current boyfriend I would cut. I know I have codependent issues and I am fine with that, without a romantic interest in my life I am worthless. If I was truly alone and lived on my own, I would legitimately fear the high chance of dying by my own hand. I have attempted twice in the past and if it wasn't for my exwife I wouldn't even be here. \n\nThing is I don't have it in me to fight anymore without someone in my life romantically. I'm broken and no longer want to get back up when I'm down. I exist to work and pay bills, I have no desire for better (I don't deserve anything), I have no hope left, and nothing to live for other than not causing my the pain of my death.",

She us is older than me but we always got along each other really well... But one day she had to leave to Switzerland and since then we havn't seen each other again. It's been about 8 months now... We were not messaging too much, but damn I thought about her every day. And then one day my birthday came and she called me and apologised to me for not texting me and that she was thinking about me a lot too. I was completely in shock cause I truly thought she left forever. The point I am trying to make is that you should never think that the other is not thinking about you cause one day you can be really suprised. Wheter it's girl or boy, it doesn't matter cause trust me we all have feelings and thoughts we don't show to each other and there's always someone who is thinking about you, like me now :) Stay safe and text here if you feel like to tell me how your life is going :)",

I\u2019ve been in love once, a 12 year off and on again relationship. I was wholly consumed, completely co dependent. I was in so deep that when he first broke up with me I texted him loving things for 2 years just hoping for a response (I know this was completely unhealthy, borderline stalking but to be fair I was also very young and dumb). When we were broken up I wouldn\u2019t eat, sleep, cried until I threw up. He had a hold on me until well into adult hood but my feelings completely changed. He was still head over heels and I was not (I fully believe it was due to how he treated me). I actually moved on, my feelings just moved on. With time I somehow just got over it. I gained a little self esteem and realized this man didn\u2019t truly want to be with me through his actions and I deserved to be with someone that loved me with the same depth that I loved them. I\u2019m trying to remind myself of this with my current crush which can be hard with all these intense feelings. Letting go is so hard but I just wanted to drop by and let you all know it is possible! At the time I saw no one else, wanted no one else and could never imagine being with anyone else for the rest of my life but life went so differently than I ever imagined and now I can\u2019t imagine being with him like that again. That chapter has closed and if it\u2019s done, then your chapter will close too. May you all find your peace",

I was 21 she was 19, we were together for a while, but I was in the Army she was going into the Navy, I didn't want to be the one to discourage her but I wish I did.\n\nWe met when I was home on leave, before deploying to South Korea; and it was magical. She was at my buddy's house and a friend of his girlfriend... I'd been to that house a thousand times before, but when I showed up this time, it was like the atmosphere was different and wonderful. Like Christmas morning as a kid, something was there and I couldn't wait to find it. So I went in and walked straight to the computer room where she was. \n\nWe talked for the entire year that I was in Korea and when I came back we got engaged. I went to NC, she went into Navy Basic, and the distance, the separation just hurt me too much. We split agreeing to keep in touch, but she met someone else got pregnant, and got into other things and before long we weren't the same people that we used to be.",

    "postText": "seriously, how does one make friends when he finishes school?\n\nLast time I made irl friends was when I started my college in 2020. I havent made a single irl friend since. Now im really close to finishing college this year and Im a bit worried. \n\nLike yes I talk to random strangers here and there if the situation is right, but most conversations last like 5-10-15min and then we go separate ways and we never see each other ever again. We dont exchange numbers, we dont add each other on social media....\n\nidk, maybe Im just a boring person.",

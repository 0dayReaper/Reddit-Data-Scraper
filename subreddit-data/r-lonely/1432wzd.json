TLDR: I want to study environmental science in tokyo because i like their  environment",

I'm queer and autistic, a lot of tattoo shops are a lil scary. There are no tattoo shops near where I live and I want to create a safe space for anyone! We've talked about having community pantries, free haircuts/shaves, and clothes donations near or by the shop. I just want to help people, there is so much hatred in this world right now. And for the animal rescue, we already take in animals when we can, but we want to do so much more! I want a cat rescue in honor of my Mother, she helped any animals she could, but cats were her babies(besides her kids lol). I probably won't be able to do most of this though because of health complications. So, if all fails my dream is to be happy to live on for the ones who aren't here.",

Its not funny because i have diagnosed schizoaffective disorder with auditory hallucinations. This shit hurt my feelings. I also have to raise our son without much help from him. I have no idea how to raise a freaking kid. Im doing my best, but i dont want to be all alone in this situation.",

            "comment": "Hiya,\n\nShame that your ex is treating you like this considering you have a child together, especially without help from him in raising your son. While having a father is a great influence on sons, you might want to question his influence on your son in the future. By all means do your best to co-parent, I assume you've already said to him that you either need more money to look after the kid or shared custody on weekdays/weekends if he wants to be a part of the kids life. If its the case that he is just a deadbeat, like I've mentioned below raise your son solo, but give him the option to meet his father to understand why he wasn't in his life. Maybe in the future he will change and become a better man as most of us aspire to be.\n\nRaising your son will definitely be difficult if his father isnt present in some form, but raising a kid by yourself is most certainly possible. Raise your son to not be the man your ex is at the moment. Instill proper morals and independence in him so that in the future if he wants to try build a relationship with his father he can use his own radar to determine whether or not its worthwhile. \n\nYou can do this!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to DM.\n\nTake care of yourself!",

The last time I had sex was a year ago, ffs. Like I\u2019m not vein, but I\u2019m fit to pull a fit girl. \n\nYes, if I worked, maybe I\u2019d make friends at work. But right now, I\u2019m just learning to walk properly again. So I won\u2019t be working for a few months, I\u2019d say.\n\nI\u2019m not exactly desperate for friends, I like being alone. But I haven\u2019t properly gotten to know anyone for years. Maybe,  I should get more of a social life. I think it\u2019d be nice to have one or two mates on the same level as me. Because I\u2019ve never had a friend that I\u2019ve properly related to.\n\nAnyways, I guess I\u2019ll leave my psn account for anyone feeling the same. All I\u2019ve been doing recently is literally just physical therapy and ps4.\n\nLoganXZ15",

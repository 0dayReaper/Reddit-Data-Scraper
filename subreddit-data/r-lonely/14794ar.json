I mean i know no one is perfect, but i\u00b4ve analysed everything about me a bunch of times, and i didn\u00b4t found any flaw big enough in myself  to have been rejected so much",

            "comment": "Nope. Just like having a partner, sometimes it's more on the chance of circumstances, the right time and the right place. Physical attractiveness and personality play a huge role into it. There is no \"it's destined to be or not be\". It's a reason why arranged marriages last until death usually while marriages form out of love often disintegrate.",

Some ppl get in life only shit and fake ppl around no matter how much they try and if you dont like it you will be told just its your problem, deal with it, get over it etc. Btw i have also zero friends, i was never good enough for ppl and my family is toxic as much as it can be and those who didnt try same hardly understand how bad it is, how it feels.",

Maybe I will have dating options in my future after all. Seemingly affordable rates too.\n\nOf course I would prefer a real connection but this type of thing might be an upgrade from the strip club if it feels more authentic and you can bring a girl for a special occasion thing.",

I've seen some posts on here from women struggling the same way I am (one may have been yours) and I agree women with these struggles should have those options too. Sometimes it feels like we collectively seem to all have forgotten how to date at the same time. Just like the middle class in the world has gotten smaller and smaller, so has the middle class in dating.",

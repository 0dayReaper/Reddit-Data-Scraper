I remember when I went to one of these cybers that had like a club looking style, it was very dark, and it had the walls painted with videogames characters.\n\n\r  \nMy friends and I used to visit that place to do LAN parties and play some crazy games. We used to scream like lunatics every time we did something crazy in game. Everyone was friendly and it was insane lol.\n\n\r  \nBut sadly, things changed... and now it\u2019s all about the online competition. Most cybers died and I became a damn Doomer... most of my friends are busy studying or wage slaving for corporations, and I\u2019m mostly alone trying to get some friends in this new cold world I\u2019m living in.",

I used to run a small internet cafe from our house and often at night, I would play Age of Kings with the local kids and usually destroy them all haha, but it was the greatest fun for all of us. Something about lan parties. I also worked at this one call center once and after work, I promise you, as grown as men we would hang out for an hour or so to play counter strike on the office lan. It was perfect fun. Nothing lacking. Best days, best memories. Or even just playing video game head to head on the same keyboard on an old pentium 4. And the culture of piracy when internet wasn't like tap water and you had to dial into that shit with modem that sounded like it came straight out of the matrix. haha. Mann people don't know what they missed. Even by the time youtube was still young in the late 2000s those were still good days. The internet is nothing like it used to be. And computer culture is nothing like it used to be.",

We get stuck in our heads and imagination and don't even notice life passing us by while we pour our life and soul into a screen. Before, if you were a geek you would spend many hours at a time in front of a screen, but not like today. There was real interaction, places to go, and such because it wasn't just all online. Or maybe i'm projecting my own downward spiral as a doomer myself haha. I am definitely a doomer and not shy to say it",

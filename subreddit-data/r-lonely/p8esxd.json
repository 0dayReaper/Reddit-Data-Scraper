We are literally nothing without a conscious world to perceive us and interact with. There\u2019s a reason humanity\u2019s worst psychological nightmares are usually being trapped alone, in a void, etc.",

I have MS, and at 36 I've lost my eyesight and therefore my driving license, my mobility, and a lot else in between. Nobody has been there for me. I'm very alone.\n\nI'm doing a degree and doing my best and you know what? I am something. Nobody sees me or knows but I am  AWESOME. I am not 'nothing' because nobody is out there to perceive my achievements. People are missing out on me, not the other way round, and I live in hope that one day, somehow, I'll meet someone and they'll see my light, and until then I'll persevere with my studying and trying to squeeze some enjoyment out of life. It gives me genuine pleasure and a purpose and when I graduate, *despite* having no support, it will all be worth it.\n\nSo no, you are not nothing. You are amazing.",

If one bases their happiness and their ability to cope with life problems on external distractions such as friends it means that when there are no friends one will be weak and there is no justification for that.\n\nOne can face and cope with life without the aid of friends. Yeah I mean it. If you have got a purpose, can spend time alone and not feel it passing and had everything figured out on its own then loneliness is less of an issue.\n\nIn fact, I prefer to be alone and lonely most of the time not because I hate socializing or have no friends but for people who got stuff to do on their own they need time alone.",

I play decent soccer so it's easy for me to connect during pickup \n4. Most importantly,  I joined a league/program where I see the same people more often..so. we started being friends \n5. I hangout in the pool area a lot, started seeing Same people,  started friendships there\n6. I said yes to whatever. Ended up making more friends from the friends I made in steps 1 to 5. \nAre all of them close to me? I'd say few are, but it's just the beginning.. it will happen organically.",

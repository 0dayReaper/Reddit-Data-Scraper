    "postText": "I woke up feeling very depressed and lonely about my lack of romance in my life and his my attempts at playing catch-up have just resulted in my self-esteem and confidence faltering. I have been on maybe 3 dates my entire adult life. Have had 1 girlfriend irl in like 8th grade and one ldr relationship. I an still trying to date, meet someone but there is just something about me i can tell is undesirable and different.\n\nI'm not completely ugly, I've been told I'm attractive, cute and handsome but i don't think the majority of people see me that way, only a niche few. But I'm 28yo and often get mistaken for 19-22, which I'm insecure about. I don't feel traditional very manly or masculine. I'm not overly assertive or desire/chase random sex. I'm not assertive, rarely have outwardly anger and even if i have a brief periods of high energy, fun, joking behavior, I'm often quiet, isolating and without personality which i think comes across as disinterested and mean which offputs people. I try to talk to people online and irl but feel no spark or connection with anyone ever sense my ldr ex broke up with me. It feels like I'm forcing myself to even try to talk to people which i feel like is unfair to them but also I'm overwhelmingly lonely so idk if i should continue looking or stop talking to people altogether. I have friends and family who care and like me, but romantically im lonely. I get so envious of people who can attract a partner who loves them. My ex was able to attract a partner instantly after we broke up and people always leave me because of my tendency to shut down and lose interest in everything. It's like i become an unprogram npc or manikin. It always happens, i can't keep a personality and I'm insecure about it because i know its extremely undesireable romantically. I almost feel like the most considerate thing to do is remain alone and never hurt people because i think my behavior ultimately hurts people.\n\nIdk I'm just ranting. I just have nobody to tell that I'm this lonely and have these feelings/thoughts.  Anyone who reads this. Idk, I'm sure there's some here who can directly relate and for that you're not alone. I wish everybody here the best thats struggling with feelings of loneliness",

Im going to therapy to try, but i still feel these core things about havnt changed, ive just managed the overwheling emotion of them and better supported myself",

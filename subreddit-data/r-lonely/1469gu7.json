She can blame it on you all she wants but a mature person would break up with you as soon as they were having thoughts about cheating. Keep your head up king and don't fall for the manipulation. Even the excuse that you didn't change for her is dumb! Compromise in a relationship is healthy but changing yourself for the other person is out of the question and she shouldn't expect that of you. Find a girl who likes you for you, and I hope things get better for you :)",

The only reason why you\u2019re thinking this is because you\u2019re trying to find a reason for her doing it. \n\nThere is never any excuse to cheat. Do not blame it on you man. You may think you didn\u2019t her your all but you gave her what you could at the time. \n\nEverything will be okay brother. I am here for you.",

    "postText": "God I\u2019m just so emotionally and mentally drained. Been with my girlfriend for so many years and it\u2019s gradually just become more and more grey and empty. I imagine a few relationships go that way. We used to be so intimate constantly but now I don\u2019t even get looked at in an attracted way, barely kissed, she hates me physically touching her and it\u2019s so hard coz I just wanna be with her so hard! Like physically I love her body it\u2019s unreal but she clearly has no interest in me now no matter how hard I try. I\u2019ve just lost so much drive in life I used to be passionate and very creative about so many things but I just struggle so much now. I try my best really to just keep myself occupied with hobbies to take my mind of the chest tightening feeling of what it used to be and what it is now.",

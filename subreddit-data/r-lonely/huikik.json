That isn't right to do :( You deserve sincere help, especially once offered. People can be self serving that way, or perhaps they mean well and want to be the type of person to say that and mean it, but end up being unable to invest the energy or time. It's not your fault. But it's not considerate or sensitive or helpful to you. Again, I am very sorry you have to feel let down like this.\n\nI wanted you to hear from someone who often says this and means it. I do value every human being I meet and when I offer them a listening ear that means something to me. I have strong ethics when it comes to only offering help if I am able to deliver on it. I've also found that I have a higher tolerance for helping people, I don't tire easily listening to people's problems or being available as a support or friend. So it is a no brainer for me to say it and actually mean it. I attribute it to having spent time working in helping professions where I dealt with a lot of people who struggle. I have also seen loved ones go through very difficult things during times when I was able to be the stronger one for them. Supporting others comes naturally to me and also is not something I take lightly.\n\nI believe that everyone who feels they can give back, help out, be kind and offer compassion, should do so. And those who need strength and compassion from others should take it wherever they can find it. Everyone is in this world together, and no one should feel totally alone.\n\nI hope you know that even if it doesn't seem like it, there are people who really do care and will listen - but it is hard not to have a hard time if you have not found any yet. I hope it becomes easier for you to find more and more of them. You deserve that and are worth it :)",

I try to be.\n\nOne thing you can be proud of is that by going through this you are getting a better understanding of what empathy and active listening means, which will make you a better friend and also in general ground your values as a human being. You will know more about what it means to really be there for someone, and the importance of being authentic and sincere, not saying things you don't mean, etc. Best of all, you will be better at finding solid friendships, even though it might take longer and be fewer and far between. You are always going to know how to appreciate a genuine person and hopefully reflect that in yourself. It is a lonely road ahead, but there are things like this you can hold on to for some strength along the way.\n\nGood luck and please do feel free to message or share with me or this thread if it helps.",

Two weeks later, im in a position where i can keep my job if i give up my dog and spend all my money on a new place to live. I call asking her to house my dog for two weeks (with food, supplies, and a bit of cash provided). I thought that then, i could get the cheapest motel available while i found a new place. She was like \"no. I cant.\" And  basically like \"i dont get why you're calling me if we're not fucking\". So i quit my job and took my dog to the only dog-friendly cheap place available, which was a friend's house 3 hours away. \n\nPlot twist- after a few months, friend's boyfriend attacked me and i ended up calling the cops, who suggested i wait out front and call a ride. I secure a place to stay (broke by that point) but it's 3 hours away, closer to where i started. Finally i have no choice but to call my ex. She comes and picks up me and my dog and my stuff. \n\nThat was 6 years ago. I still have my dog. Here he is [hairy](http://imgur.com/a/ehTiu1A) and here he is [shaved](http://imgur.com/a/my16Msa)",

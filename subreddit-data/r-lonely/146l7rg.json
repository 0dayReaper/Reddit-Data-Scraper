    "postText": "What i actually mean is this. Apperently penguins only fall in love once. Ive been in love before but never like this before. The first few times were sudden and haphazardl. Spent most of my time fumbling through them before findingthe right answer and by then it was usually too late. \n\nWell fast forward to now. I have fallen extremely hard for not only my coworker but shes also one of my best friends. She gives me shit when i need it most. Keeps me in line and makes me think in ways ive never even imagined. Before her i had a fianc\u00e9 who turned into a monster as soon as i popped the question. I had never been at such a low point before in my life. Come to now. The one came into my life then. Helped me sort through all my bullshit. Saw my ugliness and still looked at me with loving eyes. A caring hand. I too helped her through horrible ugliness of her past ex. Then i turned into a jerk and pushed her away probably due to me being scared of losing her. And in that time. She found another guy who might actually be half decent but i havent met him yet and it honestly makes me physically ill to think about. \n\nI recently came clean to her and told her i was deeply sorry for how i was acting and how much she really means to me. How i want to spend the rest of my life with her. Her to annoy me and give me the little love punches she would do. I bought a promise ring and showed it to her to prove to her my seriousness of how deeply i love her and want a life with her.\n\nNow shes the type to take a long time to decide on things. She has said to me that she always has something going on. And multiple people have said that to her in the past. I told her that i understand and that i would wait patiently for her answer. \n\nMe and her have been fwbs in the past to help eachother and to get over our exs. But in the meantime. We also fostered an incredible friendship. She still likes me i because she told me. And that she in the past wanted to pursue a relationship with me. I just so happened to do it about 4 months later when she told me about the new guy. My whole world began to shatter. I could barely eat anything for the following week and been that way since basically. \n\nI want to do everything in life with her. I want the fights. I want the crying. I want the laughter. I want the love. I want kids with her. I am so willing to give everything to her, all i need is for her to say yes and accept me. The only problem is that its hard as hell to sit and wait for an answer from her. Especiallysince she is still probably talking with the other guy. \n\nWhat do i do ? I bet everything on her. She is my soulmate. I can say it with utmost certianty because ive never met another girl like her and not any other girl has come even close to her in any way in my eyes. Ive tried going on dates. Ive tried doing nothing. Ive tried forgetting about her and my mind is never far from thinking about her. Never far from some way of how to be better for her. Never far from thinking on how to make her laugh. Or smile. Or to even brighten her day a little.",

Hopelessness isn\u2019t unique. \n\nYou can\u2019t always reach goals my friend, if I tried every day to make the best tea in the whole world for my entire life, there would still be someone who didn\u2019t like tea and if i based my opinion on that, I would think of myself as a failure, when in actuality, I learned how to make a lot of good tea.\n\nSuffering is just as painful as working hard for a better version of life, so why not work hard and try to become as comfortable as possible. \n\nYou seem to have nothing to lose my friend, so why not continue trying, and if you fail again and again, at least you\u2019ll be familiar with the feeling.\n\nPerhaps find simple hobbies, like walking or traveling or study philosophy or religion, find a job your passionate about. And if you\u2019ve scoured the earth and couldn\u2019t find any meaning, well then go on peacefully into the night my friend. \n\nBut please, try",

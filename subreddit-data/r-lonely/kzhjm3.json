Then you'll want more hahahha which is idk but reckon the pursuit will be the thing you think was more enjoyable. The journey is always better than the destination  but it's hard to live in the moment when you want that next thing",

Personally I think it's better that you get hurt now so it's not in the future and can be worse than if someone told him before as  someone who knows alot of people who have been in toxic relationships  it's easy to get into you have to listen to your head not your heart",

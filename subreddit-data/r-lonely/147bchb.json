    "postText": "TW/ Suicide \nI graduated a few days ago and I was to gradnite the next day after graduation. I went with two friends that I\u2019ve been knowing since middle school. One of them who I\u2019ll call Sarah that I\u2019ve been best friends with since the 6th grade and we\u2019ve been so close ever since. The other I knew from middle school but got pretty close with in my junior year who I\u2019ll call Grace. We were having a pretty fun time till we went California Adventure since they were starting to gather all the seniors there for the rest of the night. We decided to go to the Cars ride since I wanted to go on it. It was my first time ever being in California Adventure so I wanted to go to many rides as I could since I could never be able to afford to go again. We were in line for only a few minutes and Sarah kept on saying that we should leave and Grace said that we could stay at Starbucks. It was currently 9 pm and the event would end at 3 am. So I kept on telling them if they didn\u2019t wanna stay in line then they could leave and I\u2019ll stay since I wanted to go. At that point I was starting to get a bit upset and annoyed so I just kept quiet that way the situation wouldn\u2019t escalate and end worse. Then they started to say why I was getting mad and I was going to explain but I just said never mind because I was starting to get even more annoyed and I didn\u2019t wanna fight. So during the time that we waited they were somewhat talking to each other but that was it. After we rode the ride we went to go sit somewhere, where Grace\u2019s friends where at and I just sat there while they were all talking to each other when all of sudden grace and Sarah left without telling me anything. Graces friends were even asking me on why i wasn\u2019t going with them.So I stayed with the rest of them and slowly they all left me by myself without telling me where they were going to be at. I just sat at a table while watching South Park trying to calm myself down since I was on the verge of tears. The good thing was that I was able to vent to a friend through text. I\u2019m very scared of being alone and left out since as a kid everyone bullied me for being fat and excluded me from everything. Over the years it\u2019s been hard for me to have friends since I\u2019m the last one that people would pick. I\u2019ve never been a person that someone would choose to hangout first, I\u2019ve always been someone\u2019s last choice. I\u2019ve always tried my best to be as nice as I can be and just be a good person overall to others since some people have been nice to me. So all I thought was that they didn\u2019t want to be with me anymore. After waiting for a while till someone that I knew came, my crush just sat right next to the table that I was sitting at with his gf who I didn\u2019t know if they were together or not. The day before gradnite was my graduation and I decided to confess to him via text since I chickened out on asking him in person at graduation. I had him for two of my classes and we would talk to each other during class and he would be so nice to me which is what made me like him. He would constantly stare at me and I felt that he probably liked me or felt something till I found out that he was in a relationship. He was constantly on and off with the same girl from middle school. People that knew them told me that she was pretty toxic to him to the point that she wouldn\u2019t let him do certain stuff or left him talk to other girls without her trying to mad dog them. Even when I found out about that I just couldn\u2019t stop liking him and thinking that he had some interest in me. He just made me so happy and I couldn\u2019t let that feeling go. He didn\u2019t answer my text so I felt that him sitting next to me with his gf was his way of showing me that he had someone. I didn\u2019t even dare to look at them since at that point I was just on the verge of just ending it all which seems so pathetic of me. He stared at me the whole time that we were near each other when my school was getting ready to leave the park. After an hour of just waiting Sarah asked me if I was with one of Grace\u2019s friends and we started to fight over text. I told them that they shouldn\u2019t of lady me alone without telling me anything and the audacity of them not wanting to wait in line and yet leave me to go to another ride. I told them that if they asked me to go with them to that ride then I would of completely been fine and forget the fight. They said that they left me because I wasn\u2019t talking to them so they left me, still not sure why they decided to go on a ride without me. I told them that if they didn\u2019t want to be with me they could of least told me instead of leaving me alone. We resolved it but I don\u2019t think I can trust them again. Sarah knew that I\u2019m scared of being alone and that was the first thing that she did to me. Now I feel like I\u2019m the problem since almost in every friendship people just drop me after they found a reason to not use me anymore. I always did everything for my friends even if I was uncomfortable or busy. I would drop everything to help my friends and majority of them couldn\u2019t even do the same for me. I think I\u2019d rather have acquaintances instead of having friends since they all leave me without explaining anything. It\u2019s only been two days since that happened and I already feel so lonely. I haven\u2019t been doing good mentally for a while now and that was just the nail to the coffin for me. I think I\u2019m just being sensitive and dramatic but I\u2019m just tired of people treating me like this and I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I still feel hurt of what they did to me and I don\u2019t know if I continue our friendship anymore. I feel so lonely and I feel like I\u2019ll never have a good friendship with someone or even date. I\u2019m barely 17 and feel like I\u2019ll never go through that.",

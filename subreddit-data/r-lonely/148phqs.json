I realised that in the last month of college, I stopped being friends with everybody. I stopped talking. I started to realise that it wasn't worth the toxicity. \n\nis the loneliness better? kindof. but I sometimes miss interacting with them.\n\nit's a shame. when you are untouchable, people do anything and everything to bring you down as if they were provoked.",

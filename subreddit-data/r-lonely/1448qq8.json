But then eventually, i run out of things to say, they get bored of me, they always say oh we should hang out but never do. And I\u2019m alone again",

(I didn't want to ask for his number or sm because all my relationships with people mostly come from my side) idk I thought there was a friendship but yeah, now spent the whole day alone again. No texts, nothing.",

    "postText": "20 years old. Any time I tried (and try) to make a friend, they either left me immediately or we stayed only acquaintances. I feel super down seeing people my age post stuff on social media where they have super fun with their friends, sneaking out, having sleepovers, doing tiktok trends, posting wholesome stuff with their besties. I know I will just never experience this kind of bond. Don't tell me to go out and meet people or join clubs because that's what I definitely tried already. I won't lie, I did have similar stuff, but it were online friendships and they too ended for varying reasons (one was bc they prioritised dating, other bc we just stopped getting along all of a sudden). Now that subreddits will be blacking out, I won't be able to even make online friendships\n\nJust wanted to vent",

I really think as your life develops and takes you in different directions, you will naturally meet people you have things in common with. It's not easy at any age, but I fully believe things will get better and you will find your people!",

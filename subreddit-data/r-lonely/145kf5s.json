I know these people I went to school with them but I can\u2019t help but think \u201cIs it my fault things ended up this way?\u201d Or that there\u2019s something that\u2019s inherently *wrong* with me. \n\nWould it be strange for me to say \u201chey I realize I don\u2019t have any friends..\u201d or is it that I don\u2019t know what friendship is.. I don\u2019t know how to bond with people without being emotionally vulnerable. Is it my fault that things ended this way?\n\nI know I\u2019m capable of sharing my love, to be kind, funny, loyal. I know my worth and what I deserve so why is it that I\u2019m so lonely?",

    "postText": "But it\u2019s like you think about the prospect of telling someone and it never seems worth it unless the person listening doesn\u2019t know you, so they are ironically in an anonymous and therefore more loving position of perspective. I wish we could be connected to the people we actually know though, but people are more focused on keeping order instead of being honest.\n\nEdit: I wanted to add that even telling someone you don\u2019t know is lacking in the sense that there isn\u2019t that comfort of familiarity, and personal connection. It frustrates me that it is this way, and has been this way in my own relationships. I know the solution is we just have to focus on healing our own trauma in life instead of focusing on what everyone else\u2019s demons but it is traumatizing in itself to go through life alone, something feels extremely wrong about it but it seems like the better poison, and maybe it won\u2019t always be this way. It\u2019s just hard to draw on encouragement when you are walking alone. But on an upside, I am glad there is many lovely people on here who thinks it all absurd as well that it has to be this way in life sometimes.",

That strong desire to be connected, to be heard, seen and valued will always be there. It eats you and there's really not much you can do about it but work with it. \n\nWhen I leave work, I dread the travel, the idea that I'm coming to a dark, silent apartment. What's worse, over the months, you start to develop these bad habits because you don't have anyone there to nag you, tell you, ask you to do this, don't do that, remind you of this or you remind them of that. Then one random day, you come to the realization, \"this isn't right..\" and you start saying things to yourself \"damn, this absolute solitude can't be healthy for my mental health.\"\n\nYou reach out to certain friends and family but you start feeling like you're bothering them or the fact that they're not putting the same time, energy or effort in talking to you. So you leave them alone and you're back to square one. Now you burry yourself into comics, games and shows because at least that keeps your mind preoccupied until you go to bed.",

And the lockdown just escalated it. But what i realised after a lot of thinking and reading was, sharing stuff with someone is a bit overrated. Dont get me wrong, it feels great if you do have someone, but if you dont, it shouldnt be that big a deal either.\n\nImagine you had a great day and everything you did that day made you happy. But when you sit alone at night thinking \"i dont have anyone to share this stuff with\", arent you being unfair to yourself? I mean, you worked so hard to feel happy the entire day, just to put it all down the drain because youre lonely and have no one to share your happiness with.\n\nLoneliness is a bitch, and in most cases it does suck the happiness out of people's lives. I have been a victim too. But i just realised i dont value being by myself enough. Once i realised that how much comfort i can have with myself and how happy i can be, my loneliness went on decreasing and i started finding lasting happiness in everything i do. If i do end up sharing stuff with someone, it just ends up like and added bonus or a cherry on the cake. I'm still not completely there mentally, i do have my bad days. But they have now become very less frequent than they used to be. But what i mentioned above has been working for me and if you are someone who feels lonely to the point that it is keeping you away from happiness, i hope this helps.",

They say, \"That's life, accept things, it's going to get better\". I don't think anyone wants to talk to people that make them feel like what they feel isn't valid. Same goes for that positive things you want to share. I feel like they don't really care so why share. I hate my bubble. This wasn't the life I wanted to live... it's not a life I want to live.

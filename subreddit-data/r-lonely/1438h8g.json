    "postText": "Yesterday, I mentioned how I lost my absolute best friend. I had mentioned that I still have family. I saw another post of someone saying that they've been deprived of human touch so long that they're starting to suffer mentally. They inspired me to make this post.\n\nI (22m) still live with my parents. I have no idea when I'll move out. And I realized that I'm afraid to move out. Right now I get a ton of physical touch. I still hug my parents quite frequently. I struggle to fall asleep without a teddy bear. I feel so fucking juvenile saying that. (I probably am). My cat also loves to be around me, but she's not technically my cat. \n\nI'm someone very isolated from the outside world. My social anxiety and lack of interests and hobbies make getting out of the house\u2014especially to social events\u2014quite a challenge. I also don't drive, which doesn't help. I still often find myself talking to myself, but right now, I can at least talk to family some of the time. \n\nI'm afraid to move out. I know I probably sound ungrateful for what I have. I'm a guy that grow up with white privilege and parents in the upper-midle-class. I just worry that when I move out, I'll be ten times lonelier than I already am. It takes me an eternity to get to where I can speak to a peer without much difficulty. Although, socializing with someone with authority over me is somehow easier. IDK why. Unfortunately, that won't get any better. In most cases post high-school, I don't have the opportunity to be in the presence of someone as frequently and for as long as I need to. In high school, I had to be there for a year before I could open up to anyone aside from faculty. I fear that when I move out I'll have no one that can grant me physical touch when I need it the most. A hug over text or phone call isn't the same. A lot of people without social anxiety get irritated when I bring up how difficult it is to socialize (for lack of a better word) with people around me. There is one person I get a text from every week and a half~, but that's not enough for me. I don't even consider a friend yet. Strangely enough, I feel loneliest when in a large room filled with people when nobody is talking to me (e.g., the cafeteria on my college campus). Anyway, I'm probably worrying too much about a future that I can't possibly predict. At least that's what I like to tell myself.\n\nA apologize if I sound a little ranty. It's 5:30 am and I haven't gone to bed yet. Have a good night/day/afternoon. Thank you so much for reading.",

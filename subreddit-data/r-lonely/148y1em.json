People have done bad things to me and I have seen people do bad things to others. Because of all these experiences I have become somewhat cynical. I tend to expect bad things from people, I find it very difficult to trust people, and I am usually a guarded person. \n\nBut is my lack of trust rational? Am I right to feel this way or wrong?",

Old ladies, rich people, poor people, young people, conservatives, liberals, doesn't matter... the truth is most people are extremely prejudiced and will lie and cheat if they feel they can get away with it and it works to their benefit. I've sold insurance, cars, and financial products, the old saying in sales is \"buyers are liars\" and it's been true for me in every industry so far. That doesn't mean you have to avoid everyone and live with constant paranoia of getting exploited or abused though, just gotta know how people think and what their motives are. If someone burns you take it as a lesson and learn to identify that mindset and behavior in others to avoid it happening again.",

            "comment": "Hiya,\n\n  \nWe all have our own unique life experiences that lead us to think in various ways. Not trusting people when you first meet them isn't the worst thing, however if its to the point where they might feel you're pushing them away it might be impacting you socially. For example, expecting a new friend not to show up for an event or believing everything they say is a lie. I know these are rather outlandish examples but you get my point. When trying to start relationships of any kind, you have to give them a degree of trust. Then its just a matter of drip-feeding it as the relationship progresses. \n\nGiven your life experiences which you've briefly described, it is completely rational for you to think like this. You are also right to think this for the same reason. However, you have to recognise that while your experiences have provided you a barrier that you use to prevent these things from occuring again, it may also stomp out new budding relationships. There is no overnight fix for this. \n\nWhat I would reccommend is thinking logically about it, try to determine the good in people, whether it be traits, personality, or anything inbetween. You've seen plenty of bad, so I don't doubt your radar for that is fine, but try to see the opposite of what you've seen. I apologise if what I say is confusing, but it might help to see things from a different point of view.\n\nFeel free to DM.\n\nTake care of yourself!",

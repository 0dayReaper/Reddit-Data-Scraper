Friends have died, I have a job working remotely, don't go to church, etc. I'm alone and will continue.\n\nMy question is what sorts of things will help me accept it instead of being in a constant state of loathing, depression, and thought about it? How to switch from being frustrated about it to dealing with the inevitable fact as best as possible? How to accept this fact and find as much contentment(happiness isn't the word....obviously) as possible?   \n\nAll ideas and opinions welcome.",

            "comment": "I have lived both sides of this. I was always a bit of a loner but had many friends in college and beyond. I was fortunate to be popular with the opposite sex (I guess some women still like brooding loners) and had a variety of girlfriends. Then I uprooted my life and moved across country to care for a terminally Ill parent. This quickly became an all consuming, 24/7 job that lasted for years. I lost a career I loved (niche career), and my girlfriend split because I couldn\u2019t give her the attention she was used to. Lost touch with old friends. (People forget about you when you\u2019re out of sight and they\u2019re involved with their own family). Covid also played into the isolation. All this to say I know where you\u2019re coming from (I\u2019m in my 40s) and don\u2019t see how I can \u201cmake a comeback.\u201d It seems counterintuitive, but I think for me expressly trying to not be lonely is a mistake. The best approach to not being lonely (or rolling with the loneliness) is not actively trying to repair it. When you take the advice of others to \u201cget out there\u201d or \u201cjoin groups\u201d you become chronically aware of how you\u2019re the one always riding solo. Trying to *not be lonely* makes you constantly think about being lonely and \u2014 again, this is just me \u2014 makes it worse. (I can elaborate on this with examples but that\u2019s the gist). \n\nSo, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s so much \u201caccepting\u201d your fate, but shifting your focus and making your new focus something else. Something big. An emotional investment and and something time consuming. In my case I always wanted to build my own house. I am not a builder but I worked in construction in the summers when I was young. And I\u2019ve watched a bazillion YouTube videos (I know, what could go wrong?). I\u2019m currently taking drives and looking for land. It will probably take me ages to build this thing (even with the help of various contractors) but it\u2019s something that I am doing for myself \u2014 and only myself. In the end, I will have a custom house to call my own. And with such a project you can\u2019t help but meet people along the way. If something comes of that, great. If it doesn\u2019t, I have my dogs.",

It's too late to \"make a comeback\" as you so eloquently stated. That's it exactly. Maybe lightning will strike but highly unlikely. I need to accept what the current situation is and that it's here to stay.\n\nI see how your house project could be helpful. Best of luck with that.

At the very least it is lazy as far as advice goes. \n\nAt the same time, if you join a group 100% without the intent of meeting people or building a social life, it might completely work. \n\nIf you join a group and kinda mope around and are too nice and a people-pleaser, I doubt much will go right. \n\nI went to a mood disorder group about 5 times many years ago. I didn't have a mood disorder really, just anxiety, but everything went wrong and within like a couple of weeks everyone started ignoring me and hated me. I think I went into it out of desperation, and either said or did the wrong things. I definitely tried too hard and was too tense and over-friendly and polite which probably came off as creepy.",

If you eat up tons of time trying to meet someone (singles get togethers, dates through apps), you might wind up chasing your tail, and what do you have to show for it? Additionally, many recommend: just go to the gym, just get some hobbies, etc. This is all well and good \u2014 but imo these things are only situationally useful (a hit of feel good chemicals, mildly productive), but ultimately time-fillers and usually don\u2019t produce something all that special.\n\nPlus, women don\u2019t gravitate towards my particular hobbies \u2014 and I\u2019m not going to take up yoga just to give myself exposure to the female gender.

A year ago, the final woman I liked cut me off after a week or so for BS reasons. That, combined with even more isolation than normal due to coronavirus era, made me just basically give up.\n\nNot being alone or finding people is psychological. It is like if you tell yourself like a mantra \"i am not lonely\" but then your mind betrays you and you feel even more alone...\n\nIt is kinda like erectile dysfunction. The rare times i had sex, it wasn't a major problem for me, but it is totally like in your head. You can show up for a date worrying all night if you will be able to get it up, and then you can't. It is the same basic idea with meeting people. If you try too hard or obsess on finding someone, you give off desperation. THAT, I can't conquer. \n\nI totally exude desperation, and look sad and angry 24/7 with a male bitch-face or something. I just look pathetic and feel that way as well.",

Ironically, I probably generate more attention from the opposite sex when I\u2019m less friendly and more blas\u00e9. As I said earlier, I really do think \u201ctrying\u201d is counterproductive, at least with my personality type. Being overly friendly works for some (most?) people as a kind of cosmic energy magnet. But for me? I think it reeks of desperation. And my natural face is resting bitch face so smiling and being *that guy* is unnatural for me. But \u201cnot trying\u201d isn\u2019t always the best thing either. I do attract more attention when I *don\u2019t* try, but it\u2019s never from the person I want attention from. The reality is that if there *is* a specific person you\u2019d like to get to know, as the guy you\u2019ll typically die of old age before she makes the move. So you kind of have to do it. \n\nHaving said all of that, I have kind of given up. I\u2019m not motivated anymore and am just kind of doing my own thing. If someone crosses my path in a serious way, I\u2019m open, though. It has been several years since I had a consistent GF. When I think about that it\u2019s kind of alarming since I\u2019m not a mutant or especially strange (okay, maybe a little eccentric). Time both drags AND flies when you\u2019re miserable!",

I also genuinely don't care about anything or anyone, so I don't have sympathy or whatever for people.\n\nIf I am overly friendly, it never comes off as genuine, it is like people can see right through that attempt. As a guy, if someone is an alpha male or whatever, they can just be friendly and polite and get a million women's numbers. In my case, it is way tougher. I then end up being too polite and too friendly and courteous to where I am talking like a robot.\n\nMy natural expression is a resting bitch face, but it is also a clear frown. Even when I am in a good mood, I just have a permanent frown. I was even going to try to have it corrected with plastic surgery at one point, but changed my mind. Not to create a permanent smile but at least look neutral like I am not frowning.\n\nI just think the best looking women who also have the best personalities are just in too much demand and you will have to pull teeth to get their attention. That is just a problem across the board. I am in so little demand, my issues are just an extra roadblock in not getting decent women's attention.\n\nThe times i did go on dates many years ago, I did try too hard, but even that is a fine line. You can say a few brilliant things, mixed in with just being silent. You can't just be a statue and not talk on a date at all or offer anything. You are better off only saying a few things, but them being very sharp and well though-out rather than rambling. I tended to ramble because i was alone a lot, and when I met someone I was like shot out of a cannon. I am sure it turned women off.\n\nIt is mind-blowing that i rarely dated gorgeous women back in the day, and now no one will even look my way. Times change quickly in life. If you have something great with someone, the grass is not always greener on the other side. Unless you are in the top 2%, you cannot afford to lose that person, because who is the alternative? Time flies more the older you get, regardless if you are happy or miserable.",

Husbands are head of the wives. Husbands,  love wives and wives, obey husband. Aliens are demons dont trust them. Osas is not always true. Work out your own salvation and also have good deeds. There will be a locust army that will wage war on humanity. Believe in faith to receive in prayer or you will not receive. Those who exalt themselves shall be humbled but those who humble themselves shall be exalted first shall be last but last shall be first, be lesser and last since the least shall be the ones who are great, let your words be few, seek Jesus and pray without ceasing, Keep 10 commandments, even Sabbath. Bless and not curse. Repent of all sin. The LORD declares: \u2018Far be it from me, for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed.' Thus says the LORD: \u201cCursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his strength, whose heart turns away from the LORD. \u201cBlessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, whose trust is the LORD. \u201cI the LORD search the heart and test the mind, to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his deeds.\u201d For the day of the LORD is near upon all the nations. As you have done, it shall be done to you; your deeds shall return on your own head. No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.

Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat. Good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap. For with the measure you use it will be measured back to you.\u201d Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, trust in Jesus only. In your mind think to love God and others. \"Luck\" comes from Satan. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword. For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if you forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise. Avoid gambling, poker, marrying idols like anime characters, claiming someone is your spouse when they are not, sexual sinful assault, supporting sin including abortion, having sex with sex dolls, and nail polish. If you are interested in a mate, it is recommended to seek God. Make Jesus Husband and love Him with all your heart. Be willing to pray to Jesus. \"Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.\" Zombies come from the covid vaccine. Oreos are bad. God is in control of all things. All lives matter not just black lives. Avoid sinful makeup and jewelry. I recommend natural. Avoid coca cola. God is close to the broken hearted so be broken hearted. Be humble and meek. Head coverings for women are biblical. Avoid fake nails and eyelashes. Be not rash with your mouth, nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven and you are on earth. Therefore let your words be few. Avoid sinful acting and theatre. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. So bless Israel and pray for the peace of Jerusalem. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. Get baptized by water if you have not done so. Avoid peterpan, spongebob, Barbie, tmz, sinful secular tv shows and music, and making Instagram and phone an idol. Avoid despising the chastening of Jesus, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. Avoid soap operas and sinfully protesting. God can protect His own people, so amend your ways and keep His commandments and trust in Him. Long hair is given as a glory for women. Avoid \"Christian\" rap. Any music that is not inspired by the holy spirit is demonic. Avoid soccer clubs. I recommend women wear dresses below the knee and to let go of sinful trousers. Avoid sinful liposuction or any aesthetic procedure, and braiding hair. Plagues of Egypt in Exodus will happen again. Walk by faith not by sight. Famine of food and the Word will occur with water shortages. Israel will be the best country in the future god willing. Cannibalism and slavery will occur. Avoid trusting the government. Russia will invade Israel and Europe. Fasting is biblical. Loving immigrants is biblical. David owuor and \"Prophets among us\" on youtube are Elijah and Moses, respectfully. Avoid gluttony and selling progeny. Dragons, giant sea creatures being seen, chimeras, super soldiers, an Antichrist army, and a war between light and darkness will happen. Dying a martyr for Jesus may get rewarded. Jesus can satisfy the longing of the heart. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for Jesus' sake, the same shall save it. Avoid being a clown. Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. and whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ. Avoid sinful Christmas, denying one's nationality for another, and being shirtless sinfully. Passover, feasts of unleavened bread, first fruits, Pentecost, Trumpets, Tabernacles, and day of atonement are biblical to celebrate. Believe in the gift of praying in tongues and the gifts of the spirit. Crying to God is biblical and God can reward tears being shed to Him. Make sure to flush toilets after using them for excretion. Economic crash will occur so try to take money out of the bank and avoid idolizing money, gold, and silver. Best blessings to everyone every second forever by infinity God willing.  Shalom aleichem",

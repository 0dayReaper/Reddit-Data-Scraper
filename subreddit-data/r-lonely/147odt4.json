    "postText": "I went on a date with a girl last Thursday. I mean i have the feeling she isn't interested but I don't get why for nearly 1 hr she put my hand on her Thigh, sat very close to me while we were watching a comedy performance and we had a pretty good time talking. Middle of the date she even spoke about plans for going out again to a hookah loungue. Why would she put my hand on her thigh and act sorta intimate with me and now not respond to me when I am just following up on something she said? Day after our date I said I like her and feel I connected with her. She said she had a good time but said she was busy the rest of the week. but said 'another time!.' I said we should go out next week to a hookah bar and she said 'Perfect.' I tried setting something up next week Tuesday and she said she'd get back to me about going out on Friday. Friday she never texted and now its Saturday....",

If then then she might've feel awkward contacting you after so long pause, or she went out with someone else in the meantime and just clicked together better.\n\nStuff like this sadly happens, you could try asking how she's doing and if she's interested in seeing you again, but I wouldn't hold my breath. Ghosting is far too common in dating",

So I sort of let time go by and had the guy figure it out himself. This was years ago when I was 19, which isn\u2019t an excuse but this post makes me wonder how old she is.",

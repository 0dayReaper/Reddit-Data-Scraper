Is it better to just stay and live with a stranger who barely talks to you? Or would it be better to be alone? I don\u2019t know. I feel too deeply and crave the impossible but don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever find it. Days will blend together either way\u2026 so what does it matter? \n\nWhat would you do? I wish my brain had an off switch.",

Most of the time what we seek and try so hard to find in others is what we ultimately want to be able to provide for ourselves, attention and care, to feel acknowledged and understood, supported to have meaningful interactions and moments with ourselves and others.",

All of this could relate to cultivating self-worth that is more grounded, less conditional, so we can see and treat ourselves as an individual with greater confidence and flexibility, to then be able to do the same expanding out to share with others too. It is also at that point where instead of focusing on deficient states we are able to focus less on our own self-maintence, and truly direct more energy beyond ourselves in a sustainable manner.\n\n&gt;\"The fact that someone else loves you doesn\u2019t rescue you from the project of loving yourself. \" - Sahaj Kohli  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Remember always that you not only have the right to be an individual, you have an obligation to be one.\" - Eleanor Roosevelt\n\nAlso back to the other point you said about love and acceptance we may not have received, it can relate to developing a more secure attachment with ourselves. Our childhood attachment style carries over into adulthood, and a big reason why a lot of people see a relationship or having a significant others as a dependent need instead of an independent choice is because we may subconsciously be trying to find that attentive caregiver we didn't have who is responsive and supportive toward us, so we can cultivate more of our own security and confidence in ourselves.",

    "postText": "I've noticed that pattern for several years now or more, and i feel it should be obvious as to why nature and reality is more cruel to men than it is for women in that regard. The human mating game, dating/relationships. As in, whenever you hear of someone who reaches a certain age, decade, and that person has never dated, always been alone, single, never been in a relationship before, or still a virgin, the person in that situation is, 99 percent of the time, a guy, male.\n\nFor example, whenever you hear of someone who goes well into their 20s, or enters 30s, 40s, and older, and has always been alone, never been with anyone, the person is almost always a guy, male.\n\nThats why hollywood will make movies such as The 40-Year Old Virgin in which the main character is a guy, male, i guarantee there will never be a movie like that in which the star is a female, woman.\n\nI pretty much never hear of women entering their 30s, 40s, and older and never having had a boyfriend before, but i can think of lots of times i've heard of guys, men, reaching ages like that and have always been alone, never dated, never had a girlfriend before.\n\nShould be obvious as to why i said that, because for all time, due to the unfairness of men always having been expected to make the first move and court women, do the pursuing, be the initiators, etc.\n\nI get mad and angry on how people and society still think men have it better than women do especially when dating/relationships, finding a partner, is one of the key critical aspects of the human existance, living life as a human being, and reminds me of certain statements i've heard from guys, men over the years when they were replying to guys, men, who were angry and upset about that gender dynamic, those statements just pissed me off so much.\n\nBut ya, i still don't get why a lot of people and society still think men have it better than women do when in fact men are more likely than women are to be alone, single long-term more than women are.",

            "comment": "So, I agree men have it tougher in terms of finding a date and can go long dry spells without having a girlfriend, a partner, a kiss, yes these things can be crippling.\n\nBut in my mind, I counter-balance it with this.\n\nYes, women can have sex easier, get in relationships easier but it's a freaking minefield. For women who struggle to get the guys they like, who have low self-esteem, they may be more at risk for domestic abuse. When you think about it, they may be more willing to \"take what they can get\" and less likely to leave if they think they can't do better than the guy they're dating. Narcissists who sense the low self-esteem in a girl might decide she'd make a perfect partner because he can dominate with little resistance.\n\nAlso, on dating sites, more girls will not match or respond to messages, but guys are more likely to be rude or flip out in casual discussions.\n\nMen can be raped by women, but it takes a unique set of circumstances and I would argue, is often less traumatic than the reverse. Women have to worry about being raped by men on a regular basis. Or being followed, pursued way too aggressively, etc.\n\nThen there's the social advantages, be it jobs, respectability in certain industries, men still have advantages.\n\nI would say one recent change to the structure that benefits women is that a lot of attractive broke women can be sugar babies or do onlyfans and make oodles and oodles of money doing very little other than being pretty and accommodating, and I do think this feels unfair sometimes. Especially when all those women see you as a chance to make money and not a possible romantic partner. Of course, this doesn't help women who are maybe not attractive enough to make it as sugar babies or onlyfans.\n\nBut it's a lot of factors to weigh. Yes, guys can be lonely longer but women got a whole lot of other shit to deal with and tbh I do get frustrated sometimes how hard dating is for guys, but I also try to keep a lot of this stuff in my mind to try and temper all that.",

    "postText": "F24, very lonely, absolutely no one to talk to at all. Sometimes i crave it very badly. I'm very introverted and I avoid strangers, but loneliness is hitting me so hard, that i don't mind it, if someone started talking to me.\nI take a train to work and an older guy (i would assume he is 56) sat next to me. He started chatting with me, i thought he was just very bored. Then he tried to get my information and phone number, he was very pushy, he confessed that he noticed me a long time ago and knows i usually take that train and where i usually sit.\nLike wtf. I don't like this at all. I don't know if it's an overkill, but I feel like he is stalking me and it creeps me out a lot.",

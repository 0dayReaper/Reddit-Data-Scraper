I regularly go out on dates with my wife, and play games online with friends, or hang out in person.  So why is it that I feel like this? Am I just ungrateful? Codependent? I feel so guilty because there's no reason to feel like I'm alone",

I felt worse after each session, as if talking and realizing made me feel worse about myself. I ended my therapy sessions after going through 3 different therapists. Many people tell me I didn\u2019t try enough different therapists but that\u2019s just not a risk I\u2019m willing to take. Are you on any depression medications?",

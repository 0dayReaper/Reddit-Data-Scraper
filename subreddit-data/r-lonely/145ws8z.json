    "postText": "I feel like I'm whining as I'm very lucky. I have 3 'kids', 15, 16, and 18, who think the world of me. The youngest is a bunch of work with life struggles, but they all love me to bits. I also have a wonderful family and a few close friends who I can call on, a well-paid stable job and my own house. Im healthy, active and still \"young\". I am super lucky in life and really should not complain. I'm just sad and lonely too often.\n\nTheir mum quit being involved in them (despises the youngest) many years ago and I've tried love with another person who pulled the pin last year (after 5 years) because she struggled with the special needs side of the youngest (and COVID sucked for both of their mental health). Being a FT dad to 3 teens (plus work and life responsibilities for 4 people) is very tiring.\n\nI wish I was content with being by myself, but I really, really love to love and to be loved. I'm scared of trying again and dont think its the right thing to do, especially while I'll only have these teens a few more years. How can I change these feelings and embrace time alone instead of rushing to fill the void?\n\nThanks for listening &lt;3",

I can be a good Mom and believe that I am worthy of love.\n\nThere has been NOTHING really easy about dating. It's knocked me down a lot. I feel like these life experiences are good for me. \n\nGood luck!",

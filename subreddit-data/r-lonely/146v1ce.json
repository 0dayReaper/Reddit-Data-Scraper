    "postText": "I (49M) go through each day wondering what I have done to deserve this. My biological family didn't want me and my adopted family were narcissists. I never felt like I truly belonged anywhere and I never felt what love really is.\nI get up and go to work each day and I come home to no one. I have three cats that are the only things that I feel love from.\nMy job is great but very lonely and boring so I'm in my head every day just thinking that no one wants me.\nI deal with combat induced PTSD and anxiety and social anxiety. I have a fear of abandonment and I'm clingy.\nYes I'm working on myself but I'm tired of being alone and not having anybody to share my day with.\nWhat does it take to find someone who is real and wanting a genuine connection in today's world?\nThank you for reading",

I deal with the same mental health issues as you all built on a foundation of lifelong major depression and being on the spectrum. I dunno...I guess some of us are too broken to deal with. I guess we're supposed to fade away into oblivion or something.",

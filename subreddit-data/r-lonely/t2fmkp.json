Do you mean generally anyone who takes time to converses with you? For me, when someone who I find moderately attractive responds to me, on social media or irl, is kind, and seems engaged in talking to me, I can\u2019t help but begin to fantasize about forming some kind of long term connection with them. \n\nI feel like such a weirdo creep for this but I\u2019m extremely guilty. It\u2019s a terrible behavior and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s why I have attracted mostly toxic people in the past who have taken advantage of me. Also, potential partners often stop talking to me as much pretty early on so I feel like they catch on to it somehow, even though I try to not let it show as best I can. \n\nSorry for rambling.

I wasn't interested in her at first but the more I got to know her the more I started to fall for her cause she's literally the female version of me. \n\nIt was the first time any girl was there for me, cared about me, complimented me etc. For once I felt wanted and it was a good feeling knowing she liked my company as we spent a lot of time together.\n\nThen I completely fucked things up a year later by telling her how I felt and she said we should take some time apart. In reality she wanted me out of her life and cut me off completely. Ngl It destroyed me and I'm still hurt from it but I'm trying my best to better myself and move on.",

Personally I've taken to calling it \"infatuated\" as rarely do I truly get to know them before something happens, though it seems I am thankfully good at hiding it or they're kind enough to ignore it, and the feeling is summarily destroyed in a violent manner in my mind. Normally at finding out the object of my affection either has little to no interest in me or is already in a committed relationship. As many people have said, it makes one feel like scum.  \nPersonally, despite looking for a good number of years without any fruits for my labor I've decided to attempt to focus more on other things. If I end up dying a virgin in some freak accident, or as some old tired man, I'll just want it written on my tombstone that \"It's partially my fault for the decline in redheads\"! All joking aside, it seems the best we can do is try to look, hoping and praying that someone will find us interesting and give us a chance.  \n\n\nGood luck to all of you out there. Stay safe, and try your best to stay true to yourself without letting someone change you into something you're not.",

I just mean I feel very insecure when that happens bc I realize that I have no friends or nothing and just feels really pathetic like you said",

Nobody of my same age, interests, lifestyle, work...nothing. So, I ended up getting the weirdest crushes mostly on men 15+ years older than me. Its like being on a deserted island but thats just the way society is now I guess, and after years of isolation when you connect to another human being its like some instinctive survival thing to fall in love or get attached.",

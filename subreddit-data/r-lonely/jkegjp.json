I also need something to look forward to and there's nothing.  The pandemic hasn't changed a thing, I was like this before it.  I feel you.",

But I\u2019ve been feeling terrible since i was like 15. And i feel immensely guilt for saying this, but lockdown has probably treated my socially anxious self a lot better than others since i no longer have to excuse myself from going out since i just don\u2019t have to in the first place. \n\nBut also, i do lowkey feel like i\u2019m rotting away since i haven\u2019t spoken to anybody since mid march apart from family, who don\u2019t take mental health seriously at all. So i feel as if i wont be taken seriously at all when i say that im not doing do good",

    "postText": "College just got over and i lost touch with most of my friends. Everyday all i can think of making new friends. There aren't any new or local evening events or communities where i can meet people and play a game or something. I am a Muslim and i cant afford to make friends in the mosque either, since it's a bunch of kids and old people who judge you. Can't talk to family either since we aren't really close. The only way i met people was through weed, and now i'm trying to quit it and get my life together but the loneliness just makes me want to give into my other drug addictions and it's honestly quite frustrating  \n\n\nI would kill just to spend time with a couple friends. There are certain meetups and events that i know but are quite far and travelling 10-15 km everyday seems like a hassle. I'm slowly falling into depression and haven't paid attention to hygeine or any social skills. i'm feeling desperate and need some suggestions on what i can do to escape this hellhole",

I don\u2019t even know what to say in this post because I figured people in here understand what I\u2019m talking about but I\u2019m also at the level of loneliness that I\u2019m feeling that desperation. So sorry to anyone who\u2019s feeling the same. If someone wants to say hi that could be nice, if not that\u2019s okay too. &lt;3",

You are absolutely right in assuming that there are many out there who are emotionally as drained as you are for various reasons and some can be even worse of.  \nI personally assume that our society in increasingly becoming selfish, self centered, lacking in attention span etc and most are unaware that building sustainable friendships/relationships would require for them to make investments by way of sacrifice of time, energy, tolerance, empathy  and patience. I do also think that, even though it may not always seem like it, there are people out there who genuinely care. It is a mere chance that you have the good fortune to come across them in our daily busy life. We can increase the chance of that happening, if you choose to socialize more and be positive and open to make sacrifices on ur time and privacy to start building a friendship.   \nWhile you prepare yourself to do so, remember to be kind to yourself during difficult moments. Engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Seek out opportunities to connect with others, both in person and online. Over time, as you actively nurture relationships and explore new experiences, you'll gradually find the companionship you seek.  \nKeep your spirits up, and never lose hope. You deserve happiness and connection, and with time and effort, you will find your way to a brighter tomorrow. Take care, and remember that you are stronger than you think. Please feel free to message me, if you wish to chat/discuss.",

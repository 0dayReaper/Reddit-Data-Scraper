There were times when my ex had that happened to her for sure so I won\u2019t pretend like that\u2019s not an issue as well. I\u2019ve seen that first hand. But I also think that everyone is a lot lonelier nowadays. I don\u2019t think that women hate men I just think they are hyper focused on the wrong ones I guess. I wouldn\u2019t say most men are horny bastards that\u2019s going a bit far. I think women get a lot more attention online and that opens the door for the few million men who can\u2019t control themselves to do things they shouldn\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t change the fact that there are billions of men who try to live the right way",

Good dudes definitely aren\u2019t out here talking about how they want to grope and cat call. Shit most men are satisfied just looking at a woman when she passes and saying nothing at all to her.",

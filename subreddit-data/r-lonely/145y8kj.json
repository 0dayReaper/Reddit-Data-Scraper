    "postText": "For as long as i can remember i have always had trouble making friends. I always had different periods when I had friends, and then we stopped talking. Everything is always my fault, my behavior. Every time I tried to change myself, but I never found a middle ground. I often see in my dreams people with whom I no longer communicate and want to cry because of this, because all this is my fault. Years pass, but I still can\u2019t forget and it hurts me. I don't want to make friends anymore so I don't have to go through this pain all the time, but I'm lonely. I don't want to go out, I don't want to do anything, I just don't want anything.\nI have few friends whom I can call and who will not leave me in trouble, but they have their own life, their friends and I have never shared my loneliness with them and I try not to communicate a lot so as not to spoil everything. \nI have been in a relationship for almost 3 years and this relationship is perfect. My partner loves me, takes care of me and respects me, but this does not mean that we should spend all the time together. He has hobbies, his friends and colleagues. He knows that I have problems with communication, but I don\u2019t want to talk about it with him anymore and I don\u2019t want to talk about how lonely I am.\nI found an internship I don't like so I can do something, cause lately I've been spending my days in bed doing nothing.\n\nI don't know what I want. I'm just lonely.",

I get withdrawn if my friend often hangs out with her other group of friends making me think I\u2019m not as interesting or fun as other people. Sometimes I just wanna pack up and leave without telling anyone. I can\u2019t make you feel better but at least knowing someone else feels that way, I guess is comforting enough. I\u2019m trying to make new friends but idk how",

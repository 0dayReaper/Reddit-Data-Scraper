I just try to distract myself from feeling completely alone so I watch movies, listen to music, and exercise to keep me distracted from feeling so alone. But nights are hard, I was wondering how you deal with this isolation and loneliness.",

I always hear about people \"making it\" (social life or whatever) much much later in life so I like thinking i'd be one of them.\n\nThere are also communities online that can help you feel less lonely. I've recently started following this small Twitch streamer (who has like 10-15 viewers whenever they go live), and chatting with the same regulars I \"see\" in chat gives me a false sense of community lol",

I also like to help people because it makes me feel closer to them when I self insert myself in their shoes. They do the walking, but I\u2019ll do the guiding. Humans really are meant to be connected in one way or another, for life is more pleasurable to reach the destination together",

Live in every moment.\n\n&gt;just try to distract myself\n\nIf you enjoy something (movies) or need to do it to live a healthy life (exercise), it isn't really benefiting you to classify it as a distraction.  If you have a lot of downtime, consider volunteering... again, not as a distraction but as a purposeful and valuable experience.\n\n&gt;nights are hard\n\nOrganize your schedule, so that you're not spending hours at home in the evening. You want to be physically tired at the end of the day so at night, you're only thinking about sleep.\n\nTry to not always be physically alone and do things that are engaging, engrossing and personally meaningful.  Join a sports league, go to meet ups, volunteer, join a religious group, go to group therapy, join a book club, become a mentor...",

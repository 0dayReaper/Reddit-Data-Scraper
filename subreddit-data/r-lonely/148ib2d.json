    "postText": "I do have hobbies, I am a clean person, I'm fairly responsible (I get behind on chores sometimes but doesn't everybody?). Wouldn't say I'm ugly, wouldn't say I'm necessarily attractive, maybe 'cute'. But I'm incredibly shy and socially awkward, I've been working on it the best I can without overwhelming myself.\n\nI've had three different dates so far, none of the women I had feelings for so it didn't go anywhere. One of them I didn't find attractive and there wasn't much in common, one of them I sort of regret not going with it but I felt like I could've found someone better (she wasn't bad, just not what I was looking for), and the other I just didn't like at all.\n\nI feel like this is progress. All of this happened in the course of 2 years. But I've really been low energy and losing confidence regardless. Part of me wants to shut back down socially, not completely ghost everyone, but definitely give more into my introverted side. It's exhausting being social.\n\nI've become exhausted easily lately, even just doing chores and keeping up with the house. I get stuff done but I'm so tired all the time. I think it's because I'm lonely. I don't have friends either, most people I meet I just don't vibe with well.\n\nI mainly just wanted to vent",

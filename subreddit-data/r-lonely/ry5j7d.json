You're the scum of this planet just because you were born and everyone will tell you that. Honestly even this post will go unnoticed and we all know that. This might just be my narrow perspective but its all I see. I doubt things will get better tho and I just wish I wasn't born, if only I was strong enough to just off myself and be done with it...\n\nEdit: I apologize if I can't respond to everyone but I do appreciate all the kind words. Thanks I hope all the lonely peeps can feel worth something someday",

However, sometimes the monkey who drags the fish up the tree to its untimely death only intended for that fish not to drown. He had good intentions.\n\nWith such ambivalence in mind it\u2019s hard to take your comment at face value, as anything more than an empty gesture. \n\nI\u2019ve had many friends over the years, and the only one I still speak to I met in RuneScape 15 years ago. \n\nThe problem with friends is the commitment to not only attending physical events but being emotionally available and preferably upbeat. \n\nAnything short of this such as behaviour that comes from agoraphobia, anxiety attacks, or depressive episodes, which are typical for people such as myself, is almost always undesirable, and the person in question might find themselves in an unpleasantly familiar situation with less modes of control more often than if they had just isolated themselves.\n\nTherefore my case against friendship is that unreasonable (and yet unavoidable unless you want to show your true colours and immediately be disowned) expectations placed upon one by oneself and by others, typically exacerbate mental health conditions and make the acquisition and maintenance of friendships almost impossible for people like me. Just my view. Best of luck.",

And there's only so much individuals can do if society doesn't reciprocate. I just told you that men seek help and they aren't listened to. Whose fault is that the men that seek help? Or the people not listening? Men are less toxic than 20 years and it's gotten worse. So clearly it's not them that are the problem.\n\nBlaming men is a lazy incorrect scapegoat and will never fix anything, all it does it make men shut up and not do anything. You would be crucified if you treated any other demographic like men, i.e. blaming black people for knife crime, blaming women for body image issues. Maybe address everyone to reflect how they treat men and how society treats men, and call it out. Ask why men don't feel comfortable opening up. And also on institutions like in mental health to do better.",

It\u2019s not that I haven\u2019t been told to stop crying or toughen up before, it\u2019s that if someone has told me that they aren\u2019t a person I want to interact with anyways and they get cut off simple as.\n\nObviously I don\u2019t have it all figured out because I\u2019m on this subreddit too but yeah.

I wish I could say it\u2019s not a gender thing, but I could choose to not be lonely at any given second by just choosing a random group of lonely dudes and get fake sympathy which as they say is better then no sympathy\u2026 but I don\u2019t, because it\u2019s men like YOU that deserve that attention and I hope I meet someone like you who understands what it\u2019s like to feel this way because it makes you all the more  real. this world is super weird and corrupted and teaching women AND men alike to be petty driven jerks like I\u2019m only 21 but I\u2019m just really shocked at how terrible this generation treats men\u2026 it\u2019s just disgusting and I hope it changes. U will meet the right friends and soulmate one day",

Folks are struggling just to keep a roof, car etc. when your trying to survive the natural inclination is to focus on yourself. Hence people are consumed with themselves which doesn\u2019t leave a lot of time or inclination to extend a friendly gesture or sustain effort to be kind to others. In walks computer games and streaming shows. Boom outlet to get out of your own life with a time sucking activity that asks nothing of you. Bam- we are all living like this feeling isolated ( before COVID) . I blame our governments for not offering a great living wage, greedy corporations who care more for shareholders than consumers and employees and taxes that give folks nothing. So we all sit around thinking there is something wrong with us. In order to be happy it is a hella lot of work to constantly put yourself out there until you get one or two people who can actually see value in making the same effort. The process tho is soul crushing but doable . But please don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s just you. Our society is breeding loneliness .\nAll I can say is along the way help others. Best way to feed your soul and find a bit of happiness. And who knows, meet another kind soul along the way. Thousands of old folks that are alone and no one ever visits. Kids sitting day after day in oncology wards who would love someone to play a game with. You never know. Do NOT give up HOPE!",

But in the olden days .. lol.. families all lived near each other ( cousins etc etc) and families in your hood knew each other. People got together for Sunday roast. Helped each other. The older ones looked after the younger. There was a Connection. Now everyone scattered. So you gotta get in a car, train or plane to go see family instead of a walk. This really contributed to the feeling of isolation. Look what I\u2019m getting at is folks feel that it\u2019s them and something is wrong with them. There is nothing wrong with them- life changed so much and now it\u2019s a bloody huge effort to get others in your life in a meaningful way. But it is out there is just more effort.",

I wonder if there is a male only workshop or therapy group that is of a personal nature that you would consider? Something like \"men's issues\" or \"therapy group for men\". At least you'd start to make some heart connections and you could talk with others about these issues.",

Because you spoke truth from your heart. \n\nThat\u2019s how you do it in real life: but be cautious who you confide in and don\u2019t be desperate. That does not end well. Trust me. \n\nPatience is called for and some stoicism. We\u2019re all in this for the long run. There is a good chance acting on suicidal ideation is not in the best interests of a depressed person. Knowing this I still contemplate it regularly. \n\nIt\u2019s a struggle but you gotta either swim no matter what or flounder and drown. And the drowning won\u2019t be as poetic as it sounds, unless you get lucky or have an effective plan in place of course - it will be ugly, and you will destroy your spirit long before your life.",

While I may put some women(those I\u2019m attracted to) on a pedestal occasionally. I feel that the expectation that we should spend 100% of our time focusing on their wellbeing while excluding the attention for the mental and physical well-being of males is an outrageous social norm.",

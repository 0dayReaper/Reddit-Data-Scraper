You were their best friend, and they had to leave this world at some point or another, so they'd be glad they got to spend their time with you, and you're allowed to miss them.\n\nAs for the dumping, I think you have either scenario A) where the girl superficially dumped you, in which case you deserve someone better (and you're allowed to mourn still), or B) they dumped you for a good personal reason, like they discovered you aren't what they're looking for. Just as you are not interested in the majority of women you see, it isn't a reflection on them, just what you want. You still get to be sad and mourn, cry, feel angry and spiteful and at times worthless, but try keep in mind that it's a process, and that you do deserve someone nice, because I highly doubt you're a douche that needs to change in any meaningful way",

I experienced similar thing.\n\nMy first ex cheated on me with a guy and I found their on BED pictures and video in their messages during my mother\u2019s birthday dinner. So I decided to break up with her right the way. A month later, she called me back and saying sorry balabala all those things about she is wrong and already done with that guy please come back. So I did (worse decision I ever made in my life). 3 months later after being together again, my dog passed away due to cancer in front of me. A day later I found out my ex still contacting that guy and things. I tried to suicide twice due to that. But you know what? Pain bought me back, asking myself why am I adding more pain to myself? And you have to open up with people to talks about what you experienced in real life (not just internet). This will make you feel more relax and less stress. Trust me. I been through that. And we all love you.",

Similar thing happened to me last year, except my cat died and my bf dumped me 3 weeks later because he said it was \u201call too much for him\u201d. I ended up rescuing a dog 3 months later and now a year and a half later I\u2019m happier because he sucked anyways. You will get through this difficult time, I always try to use adversity an opportunity to work harder on myself and improve in some way. Maybe if you can think of an area to improve on that would help create a sense of purpose out of your suffering. Anyways I hope it helps and you will get through this!",

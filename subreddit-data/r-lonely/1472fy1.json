I\u2019m past the halfway point of my life and being this touch starved is one of the main things that gets me down.",

Almost everyone is just competing here over who's more lonely, it's pathetic.\n\nAnd I get your longing for physical interaction. I've been in a long-distance relationship for the last 3 years and it can be so fucking difficult.\n\nI genuinely don't know how I'd be searching for a partner in the modern climate; the moment you get out of highschool, people get all so serious and awkward to be around. I don't know a single person around me who's in a relationship outside of their past highschool except me. And I was never in a relationship \"in real life\", so there's that. I guess it really must be something to do with social media rotting our brains, causing us to be unable to communicate, I really don't get it.",

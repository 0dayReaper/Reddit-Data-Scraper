So if anyone needs to reach out I\u2019m a message away or you can comment on this thread.",

You'll soon find people that appreciate your kindness and return it wholeheartedly. Don't get too comfortable being alone though! Some people are worth having a part in your life.  \n\n\nFeel free to DM.\n\nTake care of yourself!",

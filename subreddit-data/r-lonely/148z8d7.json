    "postText": "Weve been together for almost 2 years now. We used to be LDR but now we live around 20-30 mins away. Im being honest when I say that when he moved back, I thought things will change. I got lowkey excited because we can do things couples do now. Go on dates, just hang in person, just be physically near. At first it was good, we\u2019d go out, pick a place and sit in the car and just talk. Now? He wouldnt even want to come and see me. I feel like he sees going to see me a chore. I even offer to go see him. But he\u2019s been declining it. I have no problem with him playing his video games or doing what he\u2019s doing but is it so wrong that I hope and wish he\u2019d reserve some time for me too? I understand that he\u2019s tired from work(his work is 7 mins away and i often wfh), but I am too\u2026.but I\u2019d pull myself off the bed if it means I get to spend some time w him. \n\nIve been feeling depressed the past few days and Ive been vocal about needing him. Just his presence. Just for him to be available for me. But whole days pass without him even checking on me. Idk, am I being needy? Is he tired of me? Ive asked and talked to him about it and it feels like im doing a monologue because he doesnt really say anything about it. Sometimes he would apologize and say he\u2019ll do better. Then tells me he loves me. But nothing really changes. \n\nI dont feel like he prioritizes me anymore. \n\n\nSorry for the rumble and mumble.",

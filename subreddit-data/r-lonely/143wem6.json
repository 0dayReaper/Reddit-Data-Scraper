You can look at the \"Who's going\" list and find out how many women will be there. Not everyone who actually shows up will sign up though, and vice versa. \n\nAnd that's it, basically. Yes, it's sad I know.",

I've never been to one, though, so I can't tell you how it is.\n\nI would recommend picking up a female-dominated hobby, but I don't know if that would even get you connected to single women. You might end up in classes with partnered women...\n\n(This may be an awful question to ask on the lonely subreddit, but...) Do you have any mutuals that know any single women who are interested in dating?",

Usually, cities or towns with a large presence of college students are your best bet if you're not looking for something too serious. That's if you're compatible with college party culture, though.",

    "postText": "I am a teenage girl, and at school people are getting to the age where everyone starts flirting and dating other people. I personally know quite a few people who are having sucessful situationship/relationships and who live to tell me about it.\n\nI have one main friend who I am particularly close to, who is currently talking  to another one of our mutual friends and judging by the screenshots I've been sent, they'll be a couple any day now. I believe most of the people I know consider me the quiet or reserved friend (which I don't mind because I've basically accepted that as my identity) ,so they feel comfortable telling me about all of their relationships. But idk if  I'm jealous or just lonely as when I hear about all of these relationships I can't help but feel as if I'm missing out on something I'll never have.\n\nI had a short talking phase with a boy a couple months ago but nothing came of it. I feel as though some of my loneliness comes from the fact I just feel I have the confidence or social skill to talk to anyone without messing it up or driving them away. I also just don't seem to have interest in anyone in my year, and I feel if I did they wouldn't like me back anyway.",

I can understand why hearing people talking about their relationships with bother you tho, maybe try changing the topic whenever you can and be patient. Youll meet someone. Probably not someone you'll spend the rest of your life with but someone who you'd be happy with for a while.",

Everyone around me was in relationships and because of trust issues and such as much as I wanted to be in a relationship I never really pursued or let anything workout for me. Give it time, you\u2019ve still got lots of it left. Especially give it time since you\u2019re confused. Mistakes now can haunt you for life. When it\u2019s the right person and the right time, you won\u2019t be as confused anymore.",

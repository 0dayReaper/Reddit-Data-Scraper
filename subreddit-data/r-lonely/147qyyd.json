I've been  minding my own business, making sure I'm making enough money, and just focusing on everything other than being alone. Right now it's just been meh as it's starting to feel like before where it's just the same day on repeat over and over and I have no one to share my life with. I usually distract myself from it, but it's always itching at the back if my head. I hope all of you are doing somewhat alright as well. Feel free to dm me if you want someone to talk to (currently at work so dm me after like 4:30pm est).",

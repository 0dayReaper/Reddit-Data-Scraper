    "postText": "Life is going well and I\u2019m not constantly focused on my inadequacies but some moments of the day and when I\u2019m alone have me feeling really hollow and bad. No one loves me unconditionally besides my mom. I\u2019m not mad at people for not having interest in me, I don\u2019t deserve it. I\u2019m not attractive enough to have anyone care about me. I thought that accepting that fact would make me at peace but it doesn\u2019t. I still want to be around people. I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m being laughed at. I don\u2019t want to feel clingy over someone who doesn\u2019t care about me in the slightest. I want real true friendship and companionship from people in real life. I want to feel loved so badly.",

I have always had bad luck (Jinx is a real childhood nickname of mine, not intended to be complimentary but I embraced it), and I really thought this was it \u2014 my luck has finally turned. People talk about meeting a stranger whom it feels like you\u2019ve known forever, right? Well it happened to me. From the moment we looked at each other, when she came over to my table and I looked up, it was like we had known each other all our lives. A real lightning bolt, or so I thought. Anyway, the day before our date her tone on text messages turned. She forgot to edit some of these new messages and it appeared as though they had been written by someone else and forwarded to me (presented as if they were written by her). It became clear right away that her friends were vetting me and recommending that, despite our chemistry, she not go out with this strange loner who rolled into her restaurant. I\u2019m a decent person so I answered everything honestly. Nothing to hide. But it all went quickly from easy-breezy to an inquisition. Among her many questions was one asking how old I was. When I told her, she promptly ghosted me. The following morning she cancelled. I asked what was happening and she surfaced long enough to say that I was \u201ca little older than she thought\u201d and that she was looking for someone [exactly?] her age. Yes, there turned out to be an age gap, but not a crazy one. That said, this last text of her\u2019s didn\u2019t sound like it was written in her voice. But that was that: I went from being on top of the world to becoming even more of a loner in the span of a few days. I haven\u2019t gotten out in years because my father was stricken with a terminal illness and all my spare time has been spent caring for him. I have been taking care of him now for 4 years, and it\u2019s all I do when I\u2019m not working. I thought God, or whatever higher power you believe in, finally said, \u201cokay, enough misery and loneliness for this guy. I\u2019m going to set him up with a beautiful, kind, and intelligent girl. He deserves it.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t to be. I still think about her, and haven\u2019t met anyone since. Again, that was 2017 (or maybe the end of 2016). Her gesture of putting her phone number in the dessert box was one of the coolest things that a girl has ever done to show interest in me. I\u2019ll never forget it, but am sad that it ended before it even really started.",

It was a nice shirt and it wasn\u2019t from Saks, but his compliment definitely calmed me down. \n\nAnd recently at work, a girl I\u2019ve been crushing on said I clean the kitchen really well.

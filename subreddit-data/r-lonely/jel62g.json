This doesn't mean that you shouldn't seek either, but ultimately you have to make meaning on your own grounds, with your own identity. Although sometimes it's wrestling with the darkest experiences that fall on us that allows us to create that meaning. If we make it to the other side that is.",

            "comment": "There's three things I would change there: eat, video games, and repeat. \n \nNot because those things are bad. I like food, I play video games, and I am definitely a fan of repeating things I like doing. Much more than most. \n \nBut if you're simplifying it down to food, is there any way of turning that into a more varied activity? Exploring new cuisines, possibly joining some kind of association where you could meet people with that interest? Or maybe you aren't interested in food and just eat to survive, so moving on... \n \nVideo games are a great hobby in a lot of ways. But I would also say that they can be a really insipid addiction, not helped by everyone's mothers having told us we were addicted to them as teenagers, at a time in our lives when it wasn't an addiction, there was just little else to do. Teenagers don't have that level of control over their lives, they can't necessarily move about freely, and many video games offer some way of having virtual you receive a virtual reward and have virtual interesting experiences. This is great and has a time and a place but it sounds like you're not doing it to enjoy them, rather to fill the time in between eating, working, and sleeping. This is also easy to do because they have an extremely good content:price ratio, generally speaking. I'm not saying to stop playing them, but maybe to encourage yourself to squeeze in some different activities, so that when you are playing video games, they're not just the filler in the rotation, the activity of last resort that is better than staring into space, rather they are a high priority proc that gives you a massive burst of dopamine or whatever you want from it. \n \nIf you have to have a filler in your activity rotation, it _needs_ to be unrepetitive. It doesn't have to be permanent or a commitment, so it could be learning a new skill, or several. Even if you don't end up any good at them or you don't end up using them, just spending time enjoying doing something different might be enough to help you figure out what you would actually prefer to spend your time doing. \n \nBased on the subreddit it's fair to assume you would rather being doing stuff that involves others. Personally, one reason that I struggle with loneliness at times is that I enjoy spending time with others _just to talk about random shit_, it's not always necessary to have any shared hobbies or interests with someone if you have good chemistry. Unfortunately, though, most of the time you will not get rhat close to someone without some kind of hobby or shared interest, so it's really about making sure you go to places and meet people, you want to make a good impression but you don't need to be a supermodel, nor as eloquent as basically anyone in any broadcast media (I mean, they get a script, it's not exactly fair). Just being a person with something to say - and it doesn't have to be a lot, some people prefer to be the one doing all the talking - which leads me to my next point. \n \nMany of us here will have weird ways of interacting with others. They're not necessarily bad, just atypical. It's probably obvious if you've read this much of this comment that I do enjoy talking a lot. But I most enjoy talking to people who are similar in this respect, not quiet listeners (nothing wrong with them, just not my taste). I like the sensation of us both having so much to say to each other that we can't get it all out at once. I interrupt too often for a lot of people, but it's almost always a virtually unsuppressable reaction to what they've said - but I'm not talking one or two words here, I do mean multiple sentences. In a way it's how I show that I am interested, or ingrained in the story, or emotionally invested in them as a person. I like being interrupted in this way too, for the same reasons. But I understand how a lot of people might see it as the opposite, that maybe I think what I have to say is more important than whatever they're saying. So basically, I have this weird way of communicating that can make a lot of people think I'm rude. Not helpful for building a social life, but it doesn't make it impossible, because every now and then, I come across someone who has the same behaviour as me here, and so we actually click, and fast. \n \nA lot of people probably wouldn't even understand this with the explanation, but I struggle to see it as bad. There's nothing badly intentioned about it, and I get to explore the other person, as well as let myself be explored. The conversations branch off quite rapidly: sometimes in lots of different directions, sometimes in just a couple of the same ones. That is something that does depend on what the shared hobbies and interests are, if there are any (and there is usually at least 1). \n \nIt's a clich\u00e9 that people put on their dating profile that they like wine and going to bars. But to be honest, I wish that did count as a hobby. Whether it's dating or just making friends, I like to sit down and be comfortable (so, not getting hungry at random times) and just get to know the person, without a million bells and whistles to have you thinking about anything *but* the person you're with... \n \nI've written way more than is sensible and am not sure I had an overall point, but have a load of my thoughts and see if you can make something useful out of them. Evidently my thumbs are going at light speed this morning.",

There's not a whole lot to do or places to meet people (esp. with COVID). If I go to a bar for example, I wouldn't know how to go up to people to make friends. Seems awkward to approach a group and just start chatting and rarely do you see people alone. \n\nLots of people mention 'getting out there' but it's very vague. I'm not sure how to turn getting out into making some friends. I'm probably gonna hop on an app and see what's out there.",

But lots of the time there will be groups online that you can join and go together, usually based around an activity (although not always) - language learning is a common one, but I do not recommend this as a primary method of meeting people. The one thing you have in common with people there is that you are having trouble communicating with each other. Language exchanges are great for learning languages but the social dynamic is weird at best. \n \nMost other events are good though, unfortunately it is true that covid messes this up quite badly. Apps are the way forward nowadays, whether it's Meetup for finding events or grindr/tindr for dating. Even with the awfulness that is grindr that just represents that a lot of guys are dickheads, but there are some lovely ones in between too.",

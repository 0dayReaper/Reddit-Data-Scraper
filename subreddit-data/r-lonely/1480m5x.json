I follow Jordan Peterson speeches on YouTube. He\u2019s amazing in such advice. I\u2019d recommend you too watch his videos. It\u2019s helped me a lot.\n\nAlso there\u2019s a book called \u201cThe Secret\u201d by Rhonda Byrne. If ur not a book person, u can watch the same as a documentary on YouTube. That would help u a lot too.\n\nHope u keep feeling better and wish you the best. \ud83c\udf7b",

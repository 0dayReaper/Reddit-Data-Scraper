    "postText": "A few days ago, I met a friend on Roblox. We talked and discovered that we had a lot in common. We would talk for hours, and he even added me to a group chat with his siblings to play Roblox. During our last conversation, he said he was curious about my appearance, and I told him I was curious about his appearance too.We both showed our faces. \n\nAfter a brief chat, I sent him a picture of a cat, and he responded with an emoji. Unfortunately, that was the last thing he ever wrote to me because he blocked me. At that time, I was not aware that he had done so, and I assumed it was my internet connection that was causing issues. I told him on Roblox that I could not message him on Discord, not knowing that he had blocked me already.He then blocked me on Roblox this Friday.By the way I had only meet him this Monday and he blocked me on Wednesday and I\u2019m just curious and confused as to why he blocked me and what I should do.",

There are people who does these kind of things where they see the person that they are talking to arent that pretty/handsome, the conversations start to die off (either by not responding or just outright blocking). Happened to me before multiple times. \n\nHopefully you find a friend who respect you as a perso  regardless of looks.",

Some people\u2019s attitudes change after exchanging a photo. I often just tell them to remove or block me if they don\u2019t like what they see. Saves both of us time.",

Maybe one of your ages was a deal breaker.\n\nI wouldn't analyze it. Whatever the reason he is a rude dick who may have been friendly but wasn't a real friend.",

    "postText": "I dont think anyone is ever going to be willing to give me a chance because of how I look.  For the last decade, I have been struggling very hard with depression.  I've nearly lost many times.  I'm still not out of the woods, but I'm still trying...  Or doing what passes for trying..  That's not the point.  For a very long time I didn't feel any compulsion to take care of myself, whether bathing, eating, or brushing my teeth.  As a result, I lost a lot of weight, I got pretty grimy, and my teeth were permanently damaged.  Most of my teeth are the blackened stumps of a Victorian sugar addict.  It would cost me over $20,000 USD to have my teeth rebuilt in a presentable way, and that is just not going to be possible for me.  I have always been an unattractive man, there's no two ways about that.  I've become so painful to look at that I can't even do it myself anymore.    \n\n\nThe only thing that's ever made me feel even a little bit better about myself was being involved with someone else.  I feel like those days are gone.  I'm middle aged, I've wasted the majority of my life, my hobbies don't exist and my personality has been boiled down to \"I'm going to get high, play video games, and leave people alone as much as possible because I don't fit in with them and none of them like me anyway.\"  I feel like all that's left for me as an option in the world is to continue to wait until I'm lucky enough to die, hopefully soon, because there's no happiness for me here.",

            "comment": "Let's be honest, if your teeth are that bad, you are at a disadvantage when it comes to meeting people. Not everyone is focused on looks, but having good teeth is usually considered a bare minimum for a lot of people. I think you need to do whatever you can to afford the dental work that you require. Find a way to finance it. Take a line out on your house? Find a dentist who offers financing? \n\nI don't often recommended people go into debt, but this is literally something life changing that will give you the confidence and looks you need to find someone. Would you rather have a monthly payment, or be miserable playing video games and getting high for the rest of your life? Also think of your health, dental hygiene isn't just cosmetic.",

I don't even have a job right now.  There is literally nothing that I can do about my dental situation unless I win the lottery.",

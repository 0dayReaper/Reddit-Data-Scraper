I'm trying to find friends and im always there for everyone but no one wants to be friends. Is it my fault? I mean I like things like gaming,music,pets,food,movies and books but yet im always not good enough to be a fricking friend? Maybe im just weird and maybe that's why ik crying to some strangers online! Anyone want to be friends and pls maybe not drop ne after idk one and a half day?",

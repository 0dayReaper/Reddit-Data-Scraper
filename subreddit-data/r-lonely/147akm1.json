    "postText": "For years I've wanted to be a shadow. Just existing among people without being noticed, cautious of taking the spotlight in any given situation. And it seems I've achieved it. Now I'm just in the sidelines, untouched by most people I know unless I engage first. But this isn't a happy end. Quite the opposite, I despise this. Feeling like I'm always forgotten unless directly in view.\n\nIs this what I wanted? What I want? No matter my thoughts, it won't change. Not due to my efforts, at least. With each passing week I grow more comfortable and complacent in this corner. I can't tell if I should be happy or upset, or maybe neither. But what I know for sure, is that none of my emotions will be heard by the people I like.",

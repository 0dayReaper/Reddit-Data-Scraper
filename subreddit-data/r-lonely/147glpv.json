            "comment": "Yeah man, I feel you. I\u2019ve quit my job earlier in the year due to high anxiety and depression. I started working immediately after high school, and my life was just work and home, work and home. I never went out except for maybe fast food or the grocery store. I didn\u2019t meet up with any friends, didn\u2019t hang out with anyone my age at all for like a year and a half. That shit made me so depressed that I just broke. It\u2019s been a couple months now since I quit and I just don\u2019t know what to make of myself anymore. I\u2019ve been thinking of college, but just don\u2019t have the drive to apply or anything, as I\u2019m not interested in any career at all. I guess the only choice we really have is to work a min wage job and keep on pushing.",

    "postText": "I recently ended a 5 year relationship. It was on mutual and amicable terms, and we\u2019re still friends. However I\u2019ve slowly felt myself becoming more isolated and have unfortunately just not had great luck with the friends I thought I had. \n\nNot looking to bum anyone out just would really love new people to talk to. I studied psychology and business. I enjoy playing guitar, drawing, anime and outdoor activities whenever the day allows it.",

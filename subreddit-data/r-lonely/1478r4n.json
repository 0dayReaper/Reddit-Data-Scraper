But I have my dog and that helps.\n\nIf you are feeling good some of the time, even though you are crying sometimes you are coping. \n\nThis is going to sound really stupid (and I am isolated by illness so I can't take my own advice) but the easiest place I know of to make friends is if you have a unitarian universalist church in your area. You don't need to believe in God -- it is for all denominations. The congregation near me has atheists, wiccans and pagans along with Christians, Muslims &amp; Jews and is LGBTQ+ friendly in the extreme. They usually have pot luck suppers and a bunch of different social justice committees.\n\nMost have more women then men. Anyhow, even if the people are older than your age group UU is connected with all kinds of humanist student groups. You can literally tell them you are lonely and they will hook you up. \n\n(These congregations do skew progressive so if you are politically extremely conservative it may not be a great fit). \n\nAnyhow, Google it, it is worth a try. If you are near a college you probably are near a UU congregation.\n\nIf I'd reconnected with the one near me before I got this isolated I'd have people I could call right now.",

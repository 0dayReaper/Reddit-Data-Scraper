    "postText": "Literally every single night and can\u2019t help but stay up thinking about people from my past that I cared about that left me and I know it\u2019s really unhealthy but I can\u2019t stop this thoughts no matter how hard I try. \n\nA part of it is because deep down I know that every single time this happens to me a part of my heart just breaks and it can never heal. No matter how hard I try, I\u2019ve tried therapy, meds, nothing works. \n\nI\u2019m so sick of the cycle of loneliness, depression, and isolation but I don\u2019t know what to do to change. Everything I used to love doing has lost its value to me, I\u2019m literally an empty shell of a person.\n\nEvery night I stay up crying thinking about the person I wish I was. The only option I can think of is to just kill myself so I can stop feeling this way.",

Or I might be suffering from something I don\u2019t share with anyone and just disappear. There\u2019s also instances where I get put off by affection and feel I don\u2019t deserve it. These are all examples of stuff I\u2019ve had to spend years working on, maybe he\u2019s suffering from something and is trying to deal with it in his own way so he can be more emotionally available for you. Don\u2019t think you\u2019re the problem unless stated otherwise, I think he\u2019s very lucky to have you worrying about him. I wish you the best of luck and hope you he texts you today",

Another reason might be  that they have found someone who in their opinion is better than you. Or maybe they have some other reasons which make it not so \"practical\" for them being with you.\nAll these things are out of your control. All one can do is let them go if they want to and keep looking for better companions.",

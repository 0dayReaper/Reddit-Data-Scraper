            "comment": "One of the characters in my favorite anime said once: \u201cAnywhere can be paradise as long as you have the will to live. After all, you are alive, so you will always have the chance to be happy. As long as the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth exist, everything will be all right\u201d, and you are going to be all right, eventually.\n\nI assure you am not an optimistic person, but i do believe that one of the basic courtesies we almost never remember to pay our worries is to go back and check how they fared against reality. \nWhat we seldom ever get around to doing - once the event is past - is pausing to compare the scale of the worry with what actually happened in the end. We are too taken up with the next topic of alarm ever to return for a composed audit.\nNevertheless, if we force ourselves to perform one, a strange realisation is likely to dawn on us: our worries are nearly always completely - and deeply - out of line with reality. Extended out across a year, our 'worry audit' is liable to yield similar conclusions. We almost lost our minds to worry but we didn't - in the end - run out of money, the conflictual work situation found a sound resolution, our friend wasn't offended and so on. We might fairly say that only 1% of all the things we ever worry about seem to reach the levels of awfulness we are solidly convinced - in anticipation - that they possess. Mark Twain's famous dictum comes to mind: 'I have lived through many disasters; only a few of which actually happened'.\n\nOn the other hand some of the reason why we are a good deal more worried than we should be is that we refuse to give our worries the kind of close-up focused attention they would need in order to dissipate. We assume that we are attending to our worries, because they fill our minds, but there is an immense difference between being obsessed by a worry and taking it apart rationally piece by piece. We can be preoccupied by a topic without ever actually reflecting on it.\nWhenever we feel an anxiety begin to gnaw at us, we should immediately clear time to worry exclusively and properly about it. We must force our minds to get very specific indeed about how a given problem could apparently 'ruin our lives' and discern any implausible dimensions a catastrophic scenario might have acquired in our imaginations. As we strive to name the worst in great detail, some of the more outlandish aspects of our fears will by necessity come to light - and can then be allayed by reason.\nEvery alarming situation involves an oscillation between a hope and a terror. We should calm ourselves by ceasing to hope for a moment - in order to look at our terror bravely in the face. We should ask: even if disaster somehow came to pass, how survivable could it be? Of course we'd like things to go well, but could the worst be borne? We might be jobless, friendless, disgraced and an outcast. Yet how could life nevertheless go on? Far more than we're inclined to believe, it would almost certainly be possible to survive despite our losses. Every day, people agree to continue without a limb or a key organ, a loved one or social status. What we think we need is very different from what we could actually bear. We're a lot more resilient than we assume.\n\nPeace of mind doesn't come from hoping for the best; it comes from close-up attention to the very worst - and from the sure knowledge that we can, with the strength we have inside us already, endure whatever fate might assign us.\n\nSorry for the long reply, but I\u2019ve found that reading is the only thing that helped me make life more bearable by exploring new perspectives and becoming mentally stronger and so wanted to share some of them with you. Take care OP and hope you find some peace.",

Don't worry about whether you're talking too much, just say what you wanna say to who you wanna say it to. You won't be as lonely if people know you exist, you know? Also, never apologize for being you. If it's something you stand for, you have no reason to regret it. I have some social anxiety and it helps me to know that. You have permission to be you, and anyone who tells you otherwise doesn't know what they're talking about.",

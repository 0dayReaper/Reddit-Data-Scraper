    "postText": "ive isolated myself for over a year because im just so anxious and nervous around people. I have a really hard time trusting anyone or letting them get even slightly close to me, and talking to people seems to drain me completely...im so awkward that it makes me just want to shut up. I feel pathetic saying this but i also hate how i look so much that it makes me really self concious when talking to anyone, i want to hide my face...but i dont actually want to hide. \n\nI just want to feel comfortable around people, have friends and go actually DO things instead of just work and come home and maybe go to a store once in awhile. Thats all i do...and its pathetic. I feel so embarassed that this is how i am at 20 years old, but im not really sure how to change and im so horrible at conversation. Im scared that if i do break out of this shell, when people find out more about me theyll just hate me. Its like i dont want to be known but at the same time i really, really want to be around people and not feel this loneliness anymore...i dont know what to do with myself anymore :(",

It seems to come so easily for other people and i just can't seem to make any new friends no matter how hard i try. \n\nIt's easy for people to tell you just keep trying and to keep your hopes up but it gets so discouraging after a while. I won't say i don't have any friends because I'm still friends with people from high school but we all live in different places so we don't see each other too often. I don't know how to make new friends anymore.\n\nSorry for dumping my issues on your post. Just want to say that i relate hard to you so I hope you don't feel like you're alone in the way that your feeling. We all have out challenges in life and this is ours i guess.",

If I'm not at work, I'm home. I only leave to go to the store or go walk in the park every once in a while. And I have exactly one friend but she moved to the other side of the coast so we just text now. It's so incredibly draining to meet new people and connect with them. I find it really difficult to connect with people. I have \"work friendships\" basically people I'll chat with but they're not real friendships, very superficial. I come home and I'm alone again. And it is like a cycle. It's hard but it does make me feel at least a tiniest bit better some other ppl can relate",

I have trust issues too so I understand. It takes me a long time to fully let people in. I hope your therapy helps too. I know I need it, but the last and only therapist I had was really sucky and just made me feel worse about myself and didn't address any of the issues I wanted and would lie. Last time I checked for a new one the only therapists near me were either not accepting new patients, teaching through \"religious\" and holistic views, or online only. I just don't think I can fully open up and get help in an online therapy space nd I also don't wanna be forced to stare at my own face the whole time \ud83d\udc80. I get what you mean about getting older. I turn 24 in August and dread my birthday every day. It just feels like I'm stuck in place while the world moves on without me and I just waste my youth.

Also,  you\u2019re really not alone in feeling this way and it\u2019ll take some effort and gentleness towards yourself \ud83e\udd7a\n\nPlease give yourself a chance at least? \nif there\u2019s someone who you were close(ish) to before you isolated maybe get in touch and be honest to them, tell them you\u2019ve struggled and would like to be in touch. It\u2019s one of the most liberating experience to just say you\u2019ve been nervous and counterintuitive to what we may think  -  it actually makes you less nervous.\n\nWe all have things we don\u2019t like about ourselves but like. You have to respect yourself and be kind to yourself and talk to yourself kindly :/ \nevery human being is capable of connection - even if what you said was true, about you being uncomfortable with the way you look etc - you think \u201cugly\u201d people don\u2019t make friends?

I live in my childhood home with my dad, his dad, and my fiancee. it's so depressing, and honestly triggering my cptsd, but I almost never leave. I lost all of my friends because I stopped reaching out. I went to a New Years eve party for 2020-2021 and that was the last time I saw my friends.\n\nBeing forced to isolate because of covid, the world being in turmoil, etc has made it really hard for anyone who isn't happily naive to actually live a life worth living. It's not just you, you're not alone! I've heard so many other people saying the same thing and it sucks. We need to all stick together and spread kindness. \n\nDon't be so hard on yourself. You are a small organism on a giant rock floating in the deep emptiness of space. literally, nothing matters, and I mean that in the best way possible. At the end of the day, it's just you. You've gotta be your own rock sometimes and that's ok. Learn how to really take care of your body.\n\nFind what kind self care you naturally draw to. Slowly build a routine of something that makes you YOU, and can be used as self care. I love skin care, painting, weed, animals, etc. and having different kinds of self care options helps me a lot. Even weight lifting and working out makes me feel like a badass! \n\nBottom line, yes things get lonely and it feels like everyone doesn't like you or something. But I promise, that's not true. Take care of yourself and really appreciate just being with yourself. It's worth it.",

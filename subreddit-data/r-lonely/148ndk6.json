Being first I got a couple minutes to an hour of just seeing that person sleep peacefully. I know it's creepy by most people's standards or whatever but yeah. Then there's the arguments. Some people would say it's a bad thing but with the right person most arguments can be resolved. Last is holding hands. Sometimes it would get uncomfortable and sweaty but it was something that meant a lot because no words had to be said to know we wanted each other.",

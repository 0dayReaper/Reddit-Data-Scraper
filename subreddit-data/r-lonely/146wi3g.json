I'm flustered and shy because i'm not alone there, but i truly appreciate her compliment although its night and i don't hv my full make up or anything (tbh i dont do make up, just a bit touch up like lip balm). I still remember it until now because at the same time, i'm struggling with low self esteem. I used to be ugly but maybe became a bit better lately after losing some weight, etc.",

It was a buildup for a joke, but complement nonetheless lmao\n\n\n\"You're smart\" You're funny are pretty common\n\n\nRarely get complements about my appearance but sometimes people complement my haircut, my homies call me hot quite often, sometimes girls dig my muscles. \n\n\n\nOn another note, I think I should leave this sub now. Pretty sure joined it during the covid era when I was at my lowest for about year, and have changed a lot since then. There's still a very long way to go, but I don't feel like I'm lonely, just less busy, and I'm grateful cause loneliness hurt me a lot, I hope you all find the right people and achieve happiness wherever and however you are, cause you deserve it.",

    "postText": "Currently typing at 8am, woke up almost two hours ago. I literally can't move from the bed, I've just thinking about really bad things.\n\nI usually distract myself with studying, food or entertainment but this is one of the times everything comes back all at once. How I am lonely, how I am never doing enough, how people just don't want to interact with me no matter how hard I try, etc.\n\nHow do you deal with this? I'm sure I'm not the only one who has felt these things. I don't want to lose an entire day but I don't see the point of even getting up from the bed.",

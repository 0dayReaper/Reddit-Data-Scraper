I\u2019m 28F, going through my first heartbreak, and I know I\u2019m supposed to like put myself out there and meet new people and all that. But I feel like a drag, like no one would want to talk to me in this current state. It sucks. Am I alone in this feeling?",

That's super weird.\n\nSome things are supposed to hurt, this is one of them. You shouldn't act like you're okay when you're not. Be genuine, it sucks. You shouldn't be happy and heartbroken. Embrace it, be moody, angry, sad, you should feel a bit lonely... If you let it run its course properly you will eventually get over it, if you try to push those feelings aside they'll stay there and come up at the worst possible moments. Stay strong!",

It would definitely help, but I can understand if you're not feeling like doing that.\n\nAlthough that changes things. You can definitely make new friends while you're at a bad place, other people won't hold it against you. Imagine the opposite, your friend or someone you don't know went through a heartbreak, how would you react? We tend to be unnecessarily harsh on ourselves.",

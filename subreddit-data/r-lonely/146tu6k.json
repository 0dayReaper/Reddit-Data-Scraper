    "postText": "I feel like I'm trap in relationships that doesn't seem to healthy. I get to help myself but when it comes meeting new people in real life I end up meeting people who would manage to manipulate me. At first they act like my friend and then down the line they show their true colors. I stay quiet about it thinking that they will apologize for mistreating me but it never happen. And then I get their \"talk\", and I wonder why the hell did you want me around. Then comes the gas lights and then the false safe environment. Someday I feel like going far away from everyone where nobody can ever find me. I'm not being over dramatic but that's what I want. To be isolated from everything and everyone. I deserve better and I know nobody is perfect. Just wish I could have been around better people.",

    "postText": "I'm extremely lonely, for months I've been trying to do something about it, I joined a crochet group at the library, it ended up all being very old ladies, nice to hang out for a bit and chat and yarn together once a week but not helpful in trying to be a regular 22 year old \ud83d\ude1e\n\nI work and I've got work friends, only 1 my age, him and his gf might join me and my long distance best friend in some DnD, but only after his gf gets back from being a camp counselor for 3 months \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8\n\nI see people I knew from HS at work and out and about sometimes since I live close to my old HS still, I have a few new people on socials and TikTok, I send TikToks back and forth with one of them but that's all that ended up with \ud83d\ude1e\n\nI joined OkCupid again which I haven't used since I was 18 and that's not even given me a good conversation \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 it's ended in absolutely nothing cause I've only got 4 matches (looking for friends and short-term dating) and only one of them even messaged me back..... Why match with me then????? \ud83d\ude1e\n\nAny advice? I don't have a car, I only drink a bit and not often, I don't smoke or do drugs of any kind, not really interested in smoking weed more than once a year and with friends/family. I don't like to party, at least not on my own and I have no one to go to bars with if I wanted to and it's not safe for me to go to a club on my own which is why I've never gone to one \ud83d\ude3f I even made a post on my rearly used Facebook the other day asking if anyone wanted to go to the beach with me and I got 1 like from someone who lives 5 hours away from me and I already know isn't gonna some back to our area any time soon \ud83d\ude1e",

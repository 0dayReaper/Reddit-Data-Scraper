    "postText": "I'm an electronic music artist that was fired from my 9-5 after working there for 7 years. I found other jobs here and there but haven't been able to find any gigs that care to keep me around. The 'jobs' I've had have nothing to do with my art, other than them giving me a sustainable way to live and eat. I've hit rock bottom then bounced a bit and landed back on the bottom and am currently sinking into the ground without any forsite to a remotely positive future. I'm 31 and feel that I will never be able to pull myself from this deep pit I've found myself in. I don't know what to do and Im too stubborn to let go of my music and go 100% into some bullshit career like a fucking management position at a restaurant or something that pays an average livable wage that would make me comfortable. Why is it so hard for me to be able to eat.. live.. and write music.. that combined with occasional recreational activities like rock climbing, skateboarding, and surfing sounds like the absolute ideal life. And yet. I've been living in my parents spare bedroom with my PC on an old vanity mirror sitting on a stool continuing to write music, occasionaly getting out to do said activities, or work odd jobs for little to no money before being fired. Stealing an internet connection from tethering my rooted phones hotspot so it thinks I'm using mobile data. My family is somewhat wealthy, my grandparents have a large real estate property, but my grandmother has no idea what it is I do. Everyone in my family looks at me as if I do not work and am unmotivated, slob, mooching off my parents. My father continues to ask and tell me that he 'doesnt know what I want to do'. I want to make a living from my art,but ultimately I want to live in my bliss, writing music but not being a burden to those around me.\n\nI want to catch a break, I worked so fucking hard in my 20s and the only thing I have left to show for all the work I did is pieces of music that my family members don't understand. My work has become something I can not part with. I live in tornado alley, and when there are heavy storms that my family freaks out about, I am backing up my PC and making sure my hard drives are in a waterproof back pack. This obsession has become so absolutely overwhelming and Impossible for me to let go of. I wish I could get a simple job, save up money, buy a surf board, move to the beach and not look back. But I HAVE to have my music. It's everything I've ever wanted and everything I've dreamed to create. \n\nMy relationship prospects have virtually disappeared because I have lost my ability to approach strangers and speak to them with rizz resulting in future communication. The most recent 'real world job' I had I definitely connected with and flirted with tons of the girls that I worked with but never made a move on them. I've had my fair share of romantic partners and currently it's the last thing on my mind. Of course having flings would be nice again to ease my primal need to please my limbic system. \n\nAs much as this post is reading like a incil from 4chan, I am not an incil and would consider myself a bit more left than right. I am neither a \"limp wristed liberal arts student\" or a \"alt right fascist nationalist\". I am simply a human being trying to live in a very conservative part of America that has also has a large movement of extreme left people.\n\nTl;Dr\n\nI can't hold a job, have lost everything Ive worked for besides my art and family, and need to make income. What should I do? I'm feeling like I dont know how much longer I can press on and needed an anonymous medium to vomit.\n\n(Please do not say the phrase 'get a job'. Were all adults here and can comprehend that while having a job results in income and opportunities, HOLDING onto a job ultimately determines the success, not obtaining the job itself)",

I've already never had any romantic relationships and all of my old friends don't reach out to me anymore. I can't seem to improve any more at making music, and every day I am more drained and depressed than the last. I hope you're able to get out of this dark period of your life",

Even when it seems like it\u2019s going ok I either suddenly get sick of her or I self sabotage the whole thing and piss the girl off to the point she doesn\u2019t want to talk to me anymore. I don\u2019t have mommy issues. I\u2019ve been dating around for about 6 years now and I\u2019ve stayed single. Should I seek a therapist?",

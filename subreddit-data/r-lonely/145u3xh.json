    "postText": "We\u2019d have a cycle where everything would be great for a little while, then she\u2019d get upset with me over nothing then she\u2019d lash out at me and block me/stop talking to me or treat me generally poorly.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to generalize or hide my own faults. I can\u2019t say that I was perfect. But most of the time she\u2019d *find* fault in me. Even if I was able to defend myself from that fault she\u2019d go so far as to reverse her original claim and say that I was doing the opposite extreme.\n\nI tried my hardest to make her happy over and over again. But my best wasn\u2019t good enough. I feel bad for that. I wish I could have made her as happy as she made me.\n\nIt feels awful, but I know that no matter the reality of the situation, this is what I have to do. Maybe she\u2019s in the wrong and treating me abusively. Maybe I\u2019m in the wrong and I genuinely keep fucking up. I don\u2019t know, but it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nIf she\u2019s wrong, then I have to escape, because she\u2019ll keep hurting me no matter how much I love her. If I\u2019m wrong then I need to stop hurting her because I love her.\n\nIt feels awful either way. Like I\u2019m a failure. Like I\u2019m not good enough. I wish more than anything else that I was. More than anything in the world. But I honestly don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible. I do think it\u2019s not me, and it\u2019s her own sadness causing her to lash out.\n\nI don\u2019t hate her. I\u2019m not even mad at her, really. I\u2019m just sad that there is no other way. Even if there was, I\u2019m simply incapable of finding it, and regardless of the reality I need to accept that. I do think that it\u2019s the former, but maybe only because I have to to not go insane.\n\nI wish things could have been different, because I love her. Now I can only wish that she finds her own happiness, and I really do hope she finds that. Despite all the ways she\u2019s hurt me I do think she\u2019s still a good person and I do still care for her, even if I\u2019ll never see her or speak to her again.\n\nSometimes life is just awful. But you gotta keep on going, even if you have to find a new way.",

In my case I don\u2019t blame her, as I really feel as though it\u2019s more a reflection of her own personal trauma and struggles, rather than her just being a bad person. But by continuing to try I\u2019d be enabling her.\n\nI still love her and that\u2019s why I gotta go :(",

For example, it sucks to be alone, but I don't think you should mainly seek people to comfort you and talk about your problems with; I think you should learn how to manage your problems and be comfortable in your own skin, then the friendships would be based on more positive attributes.\n\nJust saying. I don't think it pans out well when people look for others to mainly discuss their problems with, then they just end up talking about problems, which compounds each other, like what happens in mental illness communities. Sometimes, people get together based on shared issues, then they only talk about the problems all day long, which overwhelms both of them. They don't have too many joyous convos.",

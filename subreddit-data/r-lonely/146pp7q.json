The only hard part is literally having an amazing conversation with someone then suddenly they are gone. \nI do understand that there's life past the app and a lot of things happen beyond this app, but at least just have the courtesy to say goodbye or at the start of the conversation tell me that you want to converse just for a short time. That's not so hard. \n\nAnyway enough of the rants, I am not giving up I know there is someone out there that will STAY. \n\nHope to hear from you.\n\nNay",

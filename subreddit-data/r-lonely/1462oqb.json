Guessing that is probably the by product of 2 failed marriages to narcissistic women on top of being raised by one.  The human experience is such an absolute chore. I am unlearning 40 years of toxicity and trying to learn some kind of enlightenment in the process hoping that I can see beyond what is observable reality only to find out I got stage 4 lung cancer.

To then ghost the person that you\u2019ve indicated that you wanted to talk to, is not giving equal consideration to your conversation partner. Yes, there are plenty of mental health reasons that may contribute to this (and I say MAY, because ghosting is certainly not limited to this subreddit), but the other person doesn\u2019t know what you\u2019re going through. Equally, you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going through, and the effects that your ghosting might have on them.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take long to send a quick message to someone saying that you\u2019ve realized that you\u2019re not in an emotionally good place and don\u2019t feel up to continuing the communication. I feel like it\u2019s easy to come up with excuses for not being strong enough to simply give the other person the most basic closure. It\u2019s probably also easy to convince ourselves to believe that those excuses are what really stopped us from giving the other person closure, because this avoids us really having to look at ourselves, and also avoids us having to think deeply about how our cutting the communication might have affected the other person. The mental health of the person you\u2019re talking to is important too, and that\u2019s a fact that many people seem to all too easily forget.",

It surprised me myself to feel almost anxious at the expectation to interact with people after being so out of practice. It\u2019s quite possible the person you were talking to felt  pressured or somehow self conscious, especially if you don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. There are pros and cons to speaking to people online \u2014 maybe try to see it from a kinder light. I\u2019m not speaking for the bots or attention seekers, but a lot of people who post on here are going through it. Hope things get better :)",

When I feel good, I want to make friends because I have none due to the fact that I cancel plans constantly because I get too sad and unmotivated. So I post on here and talk to people I enjoy talking to for as long as I can until I get depressed and don't want to talk to anyone ever again. By the time I feel better I feel to anxious about ghosting a stranger on Reddit so I never try messaging again. It's very lonely to be a shitty person :)",

Introverts tend to get lonely and stay lonely more often than extroverts.\n\nAs an introvert myself, I want someone around me, be there for me, but don't expect them to talk to me all the time. IRL, I would run upto you, hug you for a few minutes, say something stupid, then go back in my own world for hours. I will allow you to come to me after quite some time with no interaction, enjoy my hug, enjoy our 2-5min chat, then still love you when we both sit silently doing our own thing in the same room.\n\nThis sadly is not possible over social apps. And as much as this sounds selfish from my part, it really is not. I will drop anything if you need me, but sitting through hours of constant talking about this and that nonstop would push us away from each other, because my brain is not wired  that way.",

In the past I've made some friends with whom it all seemed to just have clicked. The conversations felt effortless no matter what the topic was, and I never felt like I would bore the other person even when talking about what kind of cereal I ate for breakfast. Besides those rare cases, making new friends feels like a massive challenge and the fear of rejection makes it difficult to say anything because \"what will the other person think about me?\". As a result I rarely make new friends online, and when I do, things often just fade away because I never feel that click and it makes me feel not good enough for them to be interested in talking to me.",

    "postText": "I've been single for a while now (obviously) and I've had a bit to drink (kind of obviously)... I miss being in a relationship so much. I love the connection, the love, (the \"intimacy\") and the actual intimacy. The only reason I haven't messaged my ex yet is the realization that I miss being with SOMEONE, not being with her.\n\nI ended my last relationship (unless you count being \"together\" for five days). I did so for good reason. She was controlling and she even realized she was after I broke up with her. \n\nShe told me if I ever want to try again just let her know. That's been very tempting lately, but I respect myself too much to let that happen. I'm not doing that again. \n\nAnyway, I guess I'm done ranting. If you want to talk to me about something just send a dm or comment. I'll most likely respond. I hope you have a better night than I'm having, thank you for reading.\n\nSincerely,  your random redditor,\n\nTouchy_Hopeless_Love",

I wish I had that same mindset when I was still in my toxic relationship. \n\nDo you want to be with someone because you can\u2019t deal with you uncomfortable emotions or because you have love to share and your ready to give it to someone?\n\nGood luck Love. Treat yourself with kindness. \ud83c\udf40",

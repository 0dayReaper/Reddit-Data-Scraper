    "postText": "Hello I\u2019m using a throwaway.\n\nI have been dealing with the loss of my best friend of 5 years. Possibly the most important person in my life. Ever since losing her, it\u2019s been a very depressing and lonely life since I don\u2019t have a lot of friends and I often get judged and bullied by society for having autism and severe ADHD.\n\nI used to play with fidget spinners and cubes. I used to love reading and talking about SCP lore along other activities.\n\nNow whenever I see anything online or irl that is connected to those activities I used to do with her around. I am painfully reminded of the wonderful past I used to have. All those great memories and having someone with you. One of the few people who loved and appreciated you for who you truly are. Someone who enjoyed doing certain activities with you. He or she was like a twin sibling. Now here you are, only reminded of the loss. Stuck alone without that connection that meant everything to you.\n\n* So I stopped enjoying those activities. They only bring me sadness nowadays.\n\nAnyone go through this?",

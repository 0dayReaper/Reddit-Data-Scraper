Went through a lot of abuse and prejudice and ableism growing up. Still experience it from time, usually when meeting new people. Lots of very hurtful and damaging experiences being different like we are. Able bodied people just don't know, man. I think\"work on yourself\" is the low hanging fruit of self improvement advice. Of course it's true and everybody in the world can  always stand to improve themselves in some way. But, it's gonna be different things for different people that are most in need of working on, and no stranger from the internet is gonna be able to guide you further than the initial advice.  And then in yours and my situation, a lot of the obvious things ppl bring up (\"work out\" is a good example) aren't going to be as accessible of an option as it is for normal ppl. Ive tried joining a gym, it was too difficult for me to navigate with my disability.. most places I can't go actually. So really, \"work on yourself\" doesn't always work for everyone.  I think the important thing in the moment is to acknowledge the person's feelings as valid and not shame then for feeling down on themselves. Everybody gets there sometimes. Then moving forward try to explore what might be most helpful for them in their own unique life to try to tackle.\n\nOP, that does apply to you. The way you're feeling right now is understandable. Lots of people have felt like you feel, or feel that way now, so your not as alone as it may feel like. I personally have had your EXACT issue you described with the dating apps. And man at the time. I felt REAL shitty about myself over it. And honestly, the way I got through it, was just to get through it. I deleted the dating apps and told myself those were not the right thing for me to be pursuing.....right now, anyway. That helped a bit. Knowing I didnt have to even think about them anymore. It didn't take too long to not feel the hurt on a regular basis anymore. In that time period, I was good to myself. Let myself do stuff that I like to do, and had fun doing it. Because, I tried to remember l, I deserve to have fun and feel good and be happy just like everyone else. I'm not bad. There's nothing inherently \"wrong\" with me. Can I improve? Fuck yes I can. And I will.  Right now I'm trying to get in tune w myself and decide \"what I can work on to be a better me?\"  It's not as easy as it sounds. There are bad days. And what i try might fail. But I try to always stay kind to myself (not easy) if I can't do anything else.  And that's all I've figured out do far. Might help you since our inciting event was almost exactly the same. And if I can help  hit me up anytime. \ud83d\ude0a",

No one cares about *another* dude living in his shorty apartment, or worse, playing video games, treating themselves like garbage and complaining about \u201csociety\u2019s standards\u201d. \n\nGet out there and do something. Offer the world a service you are good at. Provide *some* sort of value that makes you wanted by others. People aren\u2019t just going to find you, or come to you and say \u201cOhhh take me!\u201d  You have to go get it. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Make yourself as strong as you possibly can, physically and mentally, and stop making excuses why you cannot do it because some magical energy is stopping you. \n\nSorry for the rant. I am in no way perfect at *any* of this, but I am making an effort everyday to better myself. Be it reading books, going to the gym, spending time with family, taking part in group activities etc. I just do it. It\u2019s part of being a human in my mind.",

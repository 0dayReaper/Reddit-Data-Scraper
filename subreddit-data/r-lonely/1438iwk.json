    "postText": "I was walking with my friend in the center of the park by the river, we noticed two beautiful girls, but I immediately liked one of them, (she was about my age, wearing a white skirt, a pink T-shirt and her hair was dyed blonde) (very pretty) I noticed  how she looked at me, oh you understand this look, I thought so now I will observe a bit and come over to get to know her, I will take her Instagram, a little later when my friend and I were talking I see her and her friend discussing something while looking at us, I realized that already  I have to act and I was ready to approach her but my friend distracted me and after a moment I see her walking towards me ok she came and asked me if I have snapchat (I don't have snapchat and never liked it)\n I told her that we don't have Snapchat but do you have Instagram and she said no (it's Canada and some people don't have Instagram yet) they said they don't have Instagram and they left with my friend, then after that we thought for a long time to come and have a look  with them or not, but still we didn't approach them anymore and already today I blamed myself all day why I didn't take her number or at least some contacts, it was my big fail, I still blame myself for it.  how can I find her now\ud83d\ude1f\u2639\ufe0f\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d. What do you think guys??\n\nI forgot to write that when she approached me and asked for Snapchat, she was very, very, very shy.",

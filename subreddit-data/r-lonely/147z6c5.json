    "postText": "So I\u2019m still feeling a heartbreak and I want to move on so bad. My gf (20f) broke up with me(20m) at the beginning  of the year. We were together for 2 years and knew each other for much longer. I put my entire being and soul into our relationship. She was my world. She broke up with me by saying \u201cI love you, I never want you to leave me and I can\u2019t imagine my life without you\u201d. Then follows it up with I\u2019m not happy and we are done. All within 10 min and left. She essentially ghosted me. Now I want to move on And 6 months later but I am so afraid to he ghosted and go through that whole situation again. I still get reminder\u2019s and memories and it sucks. \n3 weeks before we broke up she was talking about moving in with me. I want to escape her memory\u2019s and move on.\n\nSo I guess I\u2019m lonely and afraid to be ghosted again, even in a friendship sense.",

While you might have wonderful memories and had great times together surely you would rather be with someone who knows what they want In relation to you?  Give yourself some time and remember everyone you met has probably been heartbroken too.",

No emotional attachment, no commitments, it's just sex. Get it and go. Or maybe that's just what my broken self has come to believe. Any way people suck, gotta get used to that",

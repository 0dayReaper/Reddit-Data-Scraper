            "comment": "This is a catch 22 kind of conversation often. I do agree with most people here, you need attraction to someone to make them a good partner. This doesnt mean people are shallow or jerks for having standards or boundaries. If you want respect and care, its a 2 way street. If you lack certain aspects in your relationships, they will suffer.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor myself personally, ive always found intellect, passion, kindness and an unselfish heart to be super attractive to me. Doesnt matter if they were average or above looking by conventional social standards, I have turned girls down who pursued me in highschool just based on the way they treated others. It was just gross to me any time someone tried to play emotional games or use their social standing to try and get someone to date them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly, its all relative to the situation and the persons qualities and morals. If they treat people like crap and others see it, I highly doubt anything they pursue will last long. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, being unattractive isnt just physical. Its someone as a person as well. Someonecan be a physical and social \"10\", but have the emotional awareness of a rock, regardless of gender. Some of the most attractive women in my life have been girls who would have been considered plain or quiet. But when you knew them and the things they cared about, it was genuine and made them stand out .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd i do agree with some in the other comments OP, it sounds like your ex was negging you because he had low self esteem, so he put you down to feed his own ego. It just shows his weakness and how he wasnt looking for a partner, just someone to control. Hopefully you can heal from that and find someone else, but i entirely get the single life choice. Just do something positive and do it because it makes you happy. Good luck",

Beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder. \n\nI\u2019ve dated some men when I was younger, so maybe more like teenage boys, and once we had broke up, all my friends would ask me why I was with him. \u201cGirl why were you with someone so hideous?\u201d \u201cWhy did you date Quasimodo?\u201d Etc. Which I found extremely shallow of them. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing looks are important. I know that. Everyone should know that but someone somewhere might find you attractive. Keyword is might. \n\nI\u2019m fat so I know automatically a lot of people are going to find me ugly. I don\u2019t give a shit that they do. \n\nI also don\u2019t give a shit that some people have found me beautiful. Very rarely some people found me to be sexy. That doesn\u2019t really matter to me because they only found me attractive. They didn\u2019t end up liking my personality or who I was as a person. \n\nLike maybe it\u2019s just my opinion, but don\u2019t most people want a genuine relationship that isn\u2019t solely about looks? Yes looks are important, but once I find someone attractive, I want to build a stable and successful relationship with the person.\n\nEdit: a word",

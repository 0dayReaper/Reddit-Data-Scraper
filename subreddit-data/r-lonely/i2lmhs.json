    "postText": "I realised I spend a lot of my time watching or listening to YouTube videos and I think it because it helps me feel less alone. I'll put things on the background that I don't care about and spend a lot time watching stuff that I'm not even that interested in. They are mostly videos where people talk, usuallly either a gaming commentary of some kind of video essay about films.\n\nI don't feel like the people I watch are my friends, or even like I know them personally. I think I just like hearing people talk because it helps distract me from my thoughts. Does anyone do this?",

They post new content all the time.  I love finding new posts that are 2 and 3 hours long.  I\u2019ll just relax and listen to it on my tv while I play on my phone.  There are so many great channels with different types of stories.  My favorite channel is Let\u2019s Read.

Almost everytime I pass by I can hear youtube videos or netflix stuff running in some random room. Heck, I've even overheard people watching videos I already know! Some leave it running on full volume when vacuuming. And there are certain people who almost always have something running in the background, even when studying or sleeping! (The latter really bugs my mind tbh..) \n\nA technician from our city's internet provider that also services the dorms told me that internet traffic from netflix and youtube (and p\\*\\*\\*! So much goddamn p\\*\\*\\*!!) regularly messes up the network and when people book higher internet speeds to keep up, it's so many bookings at once that they sometimes have to prioritize those who need fast internet for their courses (just imagine your isp giving you a form to let your professors fill it out for proof...).\n\nAnyway, I know many there tend to feel lonely.. I mean, you live with four random people that you cannot choose in an apppartment. Sure many form friendships but I almost know more people who \"suffer\" from this flawed appartment allocation schemes than people who like it. It sound's strange to me but some prefer to isolate themselves from their flatmates and don't hang out together. But who knows, that might be the wiser choice when you have neighbours you absolutely cannot get along with.. And now we have Corona messing up social life for really everyone.",

You need to pursue real life social interactions.\n\nToo many people here avoid doing what they should do and prefer to lament their situation instead. You don\u2019t have to be alone; it is a choice.",

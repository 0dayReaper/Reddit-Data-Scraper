Nothing fulfills me, nothing scares me, everything is forced convincing and it's always been that way...I can try my hardest but what I'll get are functional copes, valued in the way of what external convinces me so. While internally I feel I should just kill myself. I've done so much fucked up shit I don't know who this is anymore. And I don't want him to live. Not after all he put me through...i think he's tired too. I'll free the both of us. I don't care anymore.",

    "postText": "i'm looking for some friends who are over the age of 30 to chat with. you can tell from my history i talk about the war in ukraine a lot but that's not a good judge of who i am, rather that's a judge of what topic my friends don't talk about much. i can rant and rave and analyze all i want with randoms but for friends here's what i'm looking for:  \nsomewhere between chatty and overly chatty  \nwilling to talk about most anything with most anyone (because i'm an anyone who talks about anything)  \nintelligent  \nplatonic, sfw, and not looking for a relationship with me  \nideally someone who enjoys long term friendships, getting to know one another, and interacting with people of various backgrounds, beliefs, locations, and such.   \ni don't want to be limiting by anything but age, since i so rarely get along with those who are younger than about 30. any gender and location are welcome.   \ni know i didn't share that much about me, but i'm a great person to have around during a blackout since i'll be still checking reddit for world news and because i will enjoy talking for a few days without so many distractions.  \nanyway send me a pm or chat (preferred if possible) if you want to talk.",

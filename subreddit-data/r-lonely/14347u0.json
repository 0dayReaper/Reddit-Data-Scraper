    "postText": "The last relationship I was in ended at the end of 2019 and I haven't been in one since. At first it was because I believed I needed to become more mature and focus on self improvement. At first it went decently, the loneliness that came with being single was fleeting. It's gotten worse over the years. \n\nNow Im starting to feel like my self improvement excuse is just that, and excuse. Although it's still a reason why I'm hesitant to try. Is not the only one.\n\n I have always felt like looking for a relationship was really desperate and forced. Letting it happen naturally feels right. I also feel like looking for a relationship because I'm lonely is unhealthy. \n\nI wouldnt want to be someone's partner simply because I'm a means to escape loneliness. I want to be someone's partner because we compliment eachother. \n\nWhat should I do?",

The whole \"it will happen when you aren't looking\" isn't likely thats a slim chance, you are gonna have to grind it out like gear in a Diablo game, start going through the process of getting relationships and then guess what, going through one after the other this shit doens't just happen.  \n\n\nThe sentence about using someone as a means to escape lonliness is dumb juice, stop drinking it, every person 'gets' something out of every relationship if they didn't they wouldn't be in it would they? People don't expend effort for nothing and relationships take EFFORT.",

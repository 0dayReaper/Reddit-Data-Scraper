    "postText": "So I am 20 years old, I study at good university, I always was great at anything i would do. I played in theater, i am playing guitar, chess. In school i had a lot of accomplishmens in various fields. I like myself, i pike my personality and who i am. Also I come from quite rich environment so I live comfortably and have a lot of opportunities to develop. In other words i have anything I would like to have in my life except love. I can not find anyone who would match me, even if it was the case, noone is really interested in me. Its not like im shy or something like that and have no courage to develop some relationship. Its just, it never works. Once i found someone i truly loved, person that would fit me but it failed and now im emotionally so dry, that there is nothing left in me. I feel like i am unable to feel anything for anyoone again, and since that person i never did. I've even developed some kind of disappointment towards people, because i feel like people are boring, don't interest me, don't surprise me and don't fascinate me. I don't want to feel that way, i want to find someone who will ensure me that there are people capable of making me feel something good again. Eh...",

Right now you have to focus on finishing school and becoming your true self. Love comes when you least expect it so they say.",

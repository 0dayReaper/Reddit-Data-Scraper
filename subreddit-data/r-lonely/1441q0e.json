    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI wanted to share my personal experience with being friendless throughout my life as a 30-year-old male. I don't really have anyone I can call a friend, and it's been like that for as long as I can remember.\n\nI never really fit in with any groups growing up, and as a result, I never really formed any meaningful relationships. It's not like I didn't try, but it just never seemed to work out for me. I know there are many others out there who are also struggling with this.\n\nI also don't celebrate my own birthdays. It's just another reminder that I don't have anyone to celebrate it with. So I just treat it like any other day.\n\nOn top of this, my dream job is to become a funeral director. I've always been fascinated by death and the process of preparing the deceased for their final resting place. It might seem strange to some, but it's something that I feel passionate about.\n\nI know my situation might seem bleak to some, but I've learned to embrace it. I try to focus on the things that bring me joy, like my job aspirations or spending time alone reading a good manga book. It's not easy, but I'm learning to accept myself for who I am.\n\nDoes anyone else out there relate to my experience of being friendless? Let me know in the comments!",

Being told \"there must be at least one person--DURRR *fart noises*\" right? Being told you're a liar for your loneliness? Isn't it super fun and epic  when people around you aren't as lonely as you but hold you accountable?",

    "postText": "My ex girlfriend and I broke up months ago and since then I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about her. I get jealous thinking she\u2019s seeing other guys and it stirs up all these emotions in me from anger to a deeply depressed state. On top of that I work a very stressful job and I\u2019m just breaking down right now\u2026 I just can\u2019t take it anymore I\u2019m so lonely and filled with so much anxiety it feels like I\u2019m trapped within my own head and there\u2019s no escape.\nWe didn\u2019t see eye to eye on things which was essential the cause of our demise and I know deep down it was the right decision but I just wish so badly I could be with her and make it work. When I go out and look at other women I think of her immediately and it fucks with me so much. The only thing that gets her off my mind is the gym and when I\u2019m stressed at work. I was smoking weed for a while to get her off my mind but that started to hurt my productivity at work so I quit. \nI just felt so lost and in so much pain for so long now it\u2019s crushing me. I\u2019ve managed it for sometime thinking it would get better but it hasn\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for venting I just really need to explain how I feel to someone but I have nobody. If anyone has any recommendations to feel better please share because I\u2019m about to give up.",

            "comment": "hey just hold on. I know it doesn't sound like much but I promise it gets better. \n\nSomething that really helps me is setting really small goals and celebrating the smallest things even if it seems dumb (cleaning a drawer, or even just making it through the day). I know it's hard when everyone else expects so much of you but just keep your eye on your own ball. Pick something to focus on that keeps you really busy (gym is super great like you mentioned) cooking/baking are super easy to get lost in and are easy to learn for example. something that also helps me is journaling and just writing down all sorts of small things about my day or just whatever is going through my head. \n\nI know it freaking sucks and I'm so sorry you have to go through this. If you ever wanna talk though I'm not a professional I can listen. Hope I helped a little, don't give up.",

I\u2019m going to try your recommendation of  journaling how I feel each day as I could see that making me more aware of how I\u2019m feeling and why. Thank you so much again, I don\u2019t even know who you are and just hearing someone tell me it gets better brings my hope back up a little. Thank you.",

I promise it actually does get better and one of the awesome things about journaling is when life sucks again you can go back and be like I already got through worse days nothing can hold me back now and that's one of the best feelings ever",

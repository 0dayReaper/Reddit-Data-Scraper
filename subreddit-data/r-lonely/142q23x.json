As the title suggests, I've learnt a hard lesson in being to trusting of people you work with and boundaries. \n\nBut now I've lost friends I was really close to and spoke to throughout the day, every day.\n\nJust feels really lonely right now and its brought up my trust issues all over again.",

I waited too long to ask for help, i take full responsibility for that, but the backlash I got was just not what I deserved. \n\nI asked for help late because I hardly ever reach out and ask for help, I always try to get to it and I'm usually the one that helps everyone else. I was really snowed under this time and had to because there was a deadline and I was already behind. Then I got called selfish and arrogant to my face in front of everyone.\n\nI wish I kept track of the number of times that I've helped everyone else so I could throw that back into their faces, but I was just too stunned to speak. 100% I could have asked for help in a better way but it still doesn't justify the way I was spoken to. Feel like I'll never get over it.",

I'm sorry that happened to you, but I hope you know that it isn't your fault at all. Could you have asked for help? Sure, but its hard to know that you need help sometimes especially if you're not used to receiving it.   \n\n\nWhat happened that you were called selfish? I can't see why anyone would ever think that just because you asked for help, least of all people you considered friends.",

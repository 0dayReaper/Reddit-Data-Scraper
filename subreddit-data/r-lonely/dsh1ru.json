All the good memorys that we made cant be just become something like jealousy.\nSecond. We both make mistakes we were young and maybe we werent ready for a relationship... But thinking on that i grown up in a way.\nSo i an few words, i hope she is having a good time in his life. The last time i heard from hear she had a new boyfriend and it was a friend so i think they would make a good couple. I hace other things to do that get sad for someone that is not involved in my life anymore but for the old times i wish a happy life to her and you for taking your time.

When that happens I try not to forget the dream or the person I saw in it, cause idk it just makes me feel a connection with someone, even if that person doesn't exist. It's nice to see that this experience happens to other people too lol, even tho it sucks",

She had fair skin and hair that was silky and black. I was also with my friends that time but my eyes were fixed at her because she was blooming. A sudden urge for me to leave my friends come up and eventually I got left alone. I muster my courage to talk to her, she told me that we could have a group date and we both agreed to that. I quickly find my friends and had a date with her that I'll never forget. Time passes by and the sun was about to set, we were at the park playing on a playground. We meet at a slide and I told her that I want to meet her again. She said the same. End of dream. I woke up empty as hell and I was worried where Ciel was. I immediately realize that it was a dream and I wrote everything in my journal. So if Ciel was out there somewhere I hope we get to keep our promise of our second date.",

Hanging out with friends and family can help me forget about that void, but once they're gone and I am in my room by myself, I pretty much use alcohol to fill that void, amongst other things.. if nobody else does this, I strongly advise that you learn from my mistakes as well many many many other people's. Don't use alcohol as a way to fulfill your hole, your void, just don't subject yourself to it like that. Nothing wrong with drinking alcohol here and there, but I am not too sure you should use it to fill the void. And so, I wait to see if that special someone will or will not come.",

I was smiling, eyes closed, swaying to the music and hugging myself and feeling very loved and treasured. I'm working really hard to be able to give myself that feeling of love and of being valued that I used to rely on others for.\n\nIt was a warm, content moment. My brain forgot where I was, that I was alone. My hand reached out as the water ran down my body, and I touched the warm shower wall. For a split second it was the firm chest of someone slightly taller than me, sharing the shower, sharing the moment of love and acceptance with me, smiling with me, thinking about our day together. They were so close, I wanted to pull them in just to press myself against them and hug them. \n\nAnd then I opened my eyes and I realized that it was just a warm shower wall. That I was alone. That I haven't seen a person without a mask on, indoors, other than my ex-husband, in almost two months. Before that was about the same. I haven't seen people smile. I haven't heard people laugh.\n\nI stood there, not feeling the water, not feeling the warmth of acceptance I'd been giving myself, not smelling my conditioner, just staring at my stupid hand on the shower wall. Numb.\n\nThis is what I have now. Fleeting fantasies.\n\nI wish I could numb myself to the need for human contact. I wish I could numb myself to the need for external validation. I wish I could numb myself to the fact that this is how I have to exist for the foreseeable future. That I have nobody to share special moments of joy with.\n\nI wish this was easier.",

    "postText": "That im 15. I am damn 15 years old, and im already afraid im am going to waste my life away, not meet someone to love, not grow old, not have kids, im afraid im not going to build up any memory, that when i Will lose contact with all my friends after i finish school and Wont be able to make new ones. I don't even know why im thinking all of this stuff, i think its because i keep hearing stories about this stuff. I don't know why im thinking these things in the first place, im normally happy but sometimes these thoughts Will just come to my mind out of nowhere. Sometimes i just wish i could become a child again, spending all day playing with plushies and my cats, not knowing all the bad things that happen in the world every day. I don't know, sometimes i just think of this stuff randomly.",

There's an entire life ahead of you, full of endless possibilities. Circumstances change, people change, you will certainly change. Personally I didn't like my teens either, no wonder you feel like that.",

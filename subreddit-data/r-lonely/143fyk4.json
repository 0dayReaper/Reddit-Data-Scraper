    "postText": "I wasn't sure where to post, but figured this was a good bet. It's been a shitty week. I thought I was going to see my brother for his birthday, but his wife had to bring it upon herself to make an issue where there wasn't one (theres more to it but i just dont wanna delve into it). Now I'm not going, and I've likely lost both my brother and my mom because I stood my ground with the SIL on how she made me feel, and im not just sweeping it under the rug because \"it's just how she is\" or \"family\". I've already cut my dad out for his toxic behavior a year ago. Now I guess I'm here. \n\nReally sucks. Now I guess I'm looking for family elsewhere, or friends. Anything to fill the void in my heart and my head. Thanks for reading\u2764\ufe0f.",

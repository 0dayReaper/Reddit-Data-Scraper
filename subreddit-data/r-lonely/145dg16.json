    "postText": "Sorry for the more boring post, but I really need to get this off my chest.\n\nSince highschool ended and I'm in university, my social life became totally miserable. In highschool I had only one real friend that I'd spend most of my time with, but she left the city and I have legitimately no one to talk to anymore. My loneliness is eating my soul. It really hurts when you text someone you thought was your friend and they completely ignore your messages and text 10 hours later, sending 5 words about their own life. \n\nI just don't know what I did wrong to anyone, that I'm being treated this way. I was extremely exhausted after highschool ended so I severed all my relationships with people I knew and for months I didn't have the strength to talk with anyone. Then I started texting back and found a friend in uni and everything seemed normal until recently. Everyone stopped answering me. The uni \"friend\" straight up stopped talking to me outside of school and treats me like her personal assistant. At this point I feel like she's spending time with my just so I'm the \"ugly friend\" and she looks better than me.\n\nI just don't understand what happened. No matter who I text, I get no response. For days. The more I text, the less responses I get. My friend out of town is doing her absolute best. She had zero social life in highschool and now she has a ton of friends that she's spending time with. And here I am. Completely alone. No one talks with me. No one even attempts to talk to me. It really hurts that when you try your hardest on finding friends, it means nothing when fucking no one has the interest in talking with you. Absolutely no one. I did my best to help people with their studies, just so I have at least someone to be friends with, and now that I'm not doing so well myself, it made me lose everything.\n\nThe best thing is when the uni \"friend\" is coming online and offline in the chat, blatantly ignoring my messages, and then has the audacity to say \"sorry, I have *do not disturb* on\". Oh but if I dared to call her out on it, I'd be a piece of shit of course. I can't bring up my emotions to anyone, cause then the conversation becomes uncomfortable af. Her new better friends straight up blatantly ignore me, and she's just dragging me around everywhere as her fucking ragdoll, just so she feels more confident with herself. \n\nI'm sick, and tired, and lonely, and I. feel. shit. I especially feel shit. \n\nDon't text me in DMs, I don't have the energy to stress over why people stop talking to me.",

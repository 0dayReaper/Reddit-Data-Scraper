    "postText": "Sure it is when you're attractive. When you're not broken inside. When the only thing keeping you from being in a relationship is choosing not to be in one. Then being single is the shit. Freedom when you want it and affection when you need it. It must be great to have pretty girls lining up to date you. \n\nBut for the rest of us being single means going to sleep alone every night. Being alone on new year's and valentines and your birthday. Settling because you know you can't do any better. Staying away from people cause you know itll end in heartbreak.\n\nSo next time you want to tell a chronically single person that being single is great, kindly shove it up your ass.",

When you hate yourself you hate the world and you feel weak and come from a place of weakness and lack when you interact with others and the world picks up on that and the \u201cright\u201d people stay away and the wrong people prey on it. People might have made this a cliche phrase by continuously repeating it on every social media possible but at its core, it\u2019s true. I\u2019m still as outwardly alone as I\u2019ve been a few years ago, objectively more so because I have exponentially fewer, close to no friends and no partner. But on the inside things have changed, I\u2019m feeling very fiiine right now. Because I don\u2019t dislike myself anymore. I can take rejection as another thing in life now and not as proof that I\u2019m the spawn of satan on earth or some shit. You need a solid baseline of worth. That won\u2019t shake at outside forces easily. Like sure you might be sad because this and this happened or didn\u2019t, but you won\u2019t die. It\u2019s not an easy state of mind to get to when you\u2019ve lived the opposite for decades. But I know who I am right now so I won\u2019t attach failures to my identity anymore or to my right to live a good life on this earth. But it might be true that some people have it objectively worse. It\u2019s still a battle against the self at the end of the day to overcome our particular struggles if we want to get to be content. Shit\u2019s pretty convoluted most days though.",

I\u2019ve been beating myself up about the things I don\u2019t have ever since I can remember thinking. I\u2019ve just stopped fighting it. Myself. I\u2019m not even sure if I feel lonely anymore, I do sometimes. If I let my thoughts wonder too much. Which is why I don\u2019t anymore. I only do things that make sense and are useful. Thinking about people who aren\u2019t in my life and feeling bad about it makes no sense from a practical perspective. I think I\u2019ve come to the point where I\u2019ve stopped suffering because of that and started doing things that I\u2019m interested in and fixing the things that have been making me feel like crap for years. You know, friends betray you, you realize they don\u2019t care about you the same way, people leave, things can happen. Things become somewhat relative. Fleshing everything down to the bone, at the end of it all, the only thing I\u2019ve always had left was me. Pos me. Weak stupid me. The me that I hated because I felt so unloved and unworthy of others. So I gave that me a support system. Me. (Literally, I\u2019m always either encouraging myself in my head or on paper graciously or giving myself tough love and directions on how to navigate a difficult situation or painful moment like it were me talking to another person. Sounds crazy? Sure. Idgaf. Nobody has ever been there to comfort me and it\u2019s not from a lack of trying on my part and I needed comfort and support so bad that I\u2019ve had enough of waiting for it to come from the outside) Thanks for the award, btw.",

When I feel close to someone, I constantly fear that I do not deserve their friendship, and thus reading into too much every part of our interaction and looking for reasons that they should leave/dislike me. This conflicting feeling of wanting to be close and fearing betrayal causes extremely troubling emotional swings that render me often unable to function in other areas of life.\n\nYour strategy to practice self-compassion is actually a great idea. I bet you wouldn't say the same thing to another person that you say to yourself, would you? I recently started practicing writing down negative things I say to myself, then reading the words from a third-person perspective. Most of the time I know logically the negative thoughts I have are illy-based, but my emotional self often dominates and imposes those feelings on me as if they were the reality. Writing the journal and reading and responding to it helps me combat those feelings.",

It\u2019s more sustainable long term. You can\u2019t be hyper like a fidget spinner all day everyday about everything. But you can be like *smol pat on the back me* at the end of a day because you conquered small goals like for example keeping my temper today and acting in a self-possessed manner when that person tried to rile me up and they did it in a really ugly way but I still managed to keep calm and logical. Or giving that right answer in school and getting a \u201cgood job\u201d from a teacher or manager at work. You know, small victories make a good day. Or even waking up early for once and making my bed when I\u2019ve beed trying and failing to do that for weeks, months (years, I mean..). Conquering bad habits that make you feel *less than* and things you\u2019ve been struggling to improve one baby step at a time. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve come to feel for the first time \u201coh my, so this is what *happy* people feel like\u201d after a period of years of unhappiness and of asking myself why I hate myself, why people don\u2019t like me, all that. I\u2019m not asking anymore. It\u2019s not my business. I do my own thing, I have my own separate universe where things continue, business as usual, regardless of what external forces shift around me. My sense of self and my sense of worth have slowly started to build into something pretty solid. And now that\u2019s my whole focus and everything else is additions to that, friends, love, rejections, people not liking me, whatever. I think that that\u2019s what most of the life of an average person should be. Tiny victories that amount to bigger ones in time and make your day a bit brighter. Just sitting on a bench for an hour and feeling the sun on your face and just existing makes you feel nice. Like the world isn\u2019t composed of just you and what your problems are. You look around and realize there\u2019s an entire wild world out there functioning and fighting for their life regardless of your feelings and existence. And it makes you think. Maybe I\u2019ve been focusing on the wrong things. I\u2019m rambling... anyway that\u2019s part of what I\u2019ve been hit with during the quarantine, but it\u2019s created a big shift in me.",

Full-time self-reflection + observation of things and people around me, it's the only progress I've always obsessively strived for. I work on and think about these things 24/7. It's the way my brain works by this point. I've gotten very good at understanding people and viewing things as objectively as I possibly can. By chance, this has translated into forming a somewhat stoic attitude towards everything and myself, not following any philosophies though. I can't really explain things in a comment in one sitting, I'm not even sure myself, I try whatever ideas come to me at whatever point in time and watch the outcomes, then I adjust behavior. I always seek the source of things and always look towards what's the most efficient solution to whatever situation. What can be changed vs what should be dealt with in terms of it is what it is, live with it. I used to have a very distorted view on life and my own self when I was younger. Man, I'm always amazed how things didn't go bad and I'm still a decent person, cause I was young and in deep depression for years with no support, nobody knew about it, I just suffered by myself in silence, I didn't want to go out and my social development got stunted, I never learned how to properly interact with people, I was addicted to the internet, would sleep up to 3 hours per night when I was still young. I only managed to fix my sleep in 2020, in my mid twenties which was top 5 best things I could ever do. Fortunately I didn't give up on school (failed college though. Once.). I'm still always feeling like an outsider, impostor syndrome, whatever, I have a really hard time being a well adjusted person socially because I'm not and I'm more or less always unsure, but I can be sociable and I've come to realize that I can be found to be likeable, at least from the outside, which is another data point that counteracts self hate. There's a whole other bunch of things that are off but it is what it is. I have a couple of friends. But at this point in my life I can lose all friends and not bat much of an eye because it's not my 1st rodeo and I have contingency plans for every situation like break ups and friends disappearing. If I decide to feel cheerful, I can just do that, what's stopping me realistically. I'm not physically sick and I'm not homeless. It's a good day. The only thing I realistically own and need is my body, which I've come to like and cherish just because it's mine. The more you look after yourself, the more you value yourself. Self hate is only reserved for bouts of depression when everything feels uncontrollable pretty much. But at least I'm way more functional than I ever dreamed I'd be when I was younger. Idk, probably not a lot of this is actionable enough but I don't know how to explain all the processes that have taken place in my head in over a decade to get me to this point. All I can say is at least don't follow  any single set of ideas or philosophies, god forbid, none online anyways, learn to think richly and keep trying things with yourself. It's a full-time job. Idk I've written too much, sorry about that.",

We cannot force others to love us or appreciate us,or worse, we cannot force others to change for better or worse.\nWhen you are a supersexy and extroverted single dude, being single is cool, same if you are a girl who has the attention of basically every guy around her.\nWhen you are ugly, fat, very thin, not very tall(150-170 cms) it is just so much more difficult, but there is not a lot of things we can do about it, Just focus on your job/studies/knowledge. \n\nThe more i understand, see and reflect about the modern world, the more i feel detached from here, most people are but a bunch of false/hypocrites and sell theirselves as victims when they have also been executioners, they all moan about people who dislike others just because they are poor/ugly/fat, but they joke about others people for the same reason, they all want true and loyal friends who are there always, but when things are reversed are the first ones to leave you alone and seen.",

            "comment": "I understand, and I can empathize. But through the despair and loneliness and sadness, we must put our best foot forward in order to attract positive people. Doesn't mean to ignore the sadness, indeed the opposite. We must embrace the sadness and loneliness, the despair and keep it close to our hearts. And we must not forget that there is good reasons to be alive, to be grateful and then we can take small steps towards a solution. We can break out of our shells, and tell every person we walk by, good morning, Ask them how are they doing, tell them, it's a fine day isn't it? We can compliment people in passing and wish them a good day, and say hello, and soon it will be automatic, interacting with as many people as possible. And in doing this we begin to feel better about ourselves, because we are making an honest effort to break out of our shells and be social in the way that people were meant to be. And as we begin to feel better about ourselves, our confidence naturally increases, and soon we look forward to interacting with others, with people we don't know, and it becomes second nature, and soon enough, we begin to attract positive people to us, and in this way, we can then begin to form bonds with others. Now of course not everyone will respond how we wish them to but we must remember that they are most likely just as anxious as we used to be, they feel just as awkward as we used to, so to these people we must have compassion, and we must make an effort to put them at ease, no matter how small, any effort, for it is our duty to each other as humans. And along this road, as we are lifting each other up and attracting positive energy from all directions, forming bonds with people that will quite possibly blossom into solid friendships, we are bound to meet a person that we would like to get to know on a deeper level, and in turn, this is the potential beginning of a beautiful, worthwhile relationship in which the sky is the limit. So I understand the pain of loneliness, and the cold grip of sadness and despair  but fret not fellow comrades, there is a solution and it is possible for each and every one of us to achieve. Good day to all my fellow lonely souls, and good luck.",

There is de facto an even worse proletariat than the \"lacking finances\" proletariat : the \"lacking support\" proletariat, the \"sexual proletariat\" also. Being alone, unable to find someone makes me feel like I am an \"untouchable\" from the Indian castes system.  \n\n\nAnd obviously the ones from the upper castes have no fucking idea whatsoever of what it feels like to really be and feel alone. For them being depressed means \"I haven't fucked for two weeks\" or \"things with my wife are not that good\". That kind of person can just not even imagine what feels the one who never talks warmly to someone close, who never makes love, who never has the chance to experience a close bond with someone else. That is where the platitudes come from. I became convinced that to really want to understand and help others you must have suffered yourself. It seems human nature is so made, that those who starved are way more prone to share than those who had it \"easy\".",

I have mentioned this before, but it\u2019s specifically germane here so I\u2019ll say it again: I paid much of my way through school as a male model. I last modeled professionally over ten years ago but I look basically the same (older, yes, some grey in my beard, but otherwise the same). I can tell you that unless you\u2019re in that rarefied 1% it\u2019s a lot of effort and hard work to get a girlfriend. Women have never lined up to date me. They didn\u2019t exactly line up to date my colleagues \u2014 better looking dudes than me. We\u2019d all bitch about it. I have been turned down *plenty*. The last girl I really hit it off with was a waitress who chatted with me at a restaurant (I was there alone, surprise). She slipped me her number, we made arrangements to meet up, and she bailed on me. That was about 3 years ago! As with everything you want \u2014 a career, good grades, physical fitness, excel at a hobby, making money \u2014 ending up in a relationship with a *worthy* person (and that who *you\u2019re* also worthy of) is a ton of hard work. They never show this in romance novels or RomCom movies because it\u2019s boring. Far from flinging themselves at me, women won\u2019t even make eye contact with me. Maybe this is what happens in all big cities...I work today in a white collar job in a profession that\u2019s tremendously time consuming. I have no free time because I\u2019m also a primary caregiver to a terminally ill parent. This has gone on for years. So I rarely get out socially\u2014 and this is all pre-Covid. Now it\u2019s 1000x as hard. I\u2019m writing all of this because if you have yourself psyched into thinking there\u2019s a big segment of the male population that can just snap their fingers and have a beautiful, intelligent, and sensitive woman, it ain\u2019t true. We\u2019re all getting our butts kicked out there. Once you recognize that we\u2019re all in the same struggle you\u2019ll work at it instead of languishing, frustrated. It\u2019s kind of like when you look on Instagram and see people who seem to be leading lives of adventure. Usually it\u2019s greatly exaggerated and their day-to-day lives suck too. These people are largely faking it. Don\u2019t get sucked into the hype. Don\u2019t beat yourself up. Make an effort. It\u2019s hard, I know. Hang in there!",

It does feel like rubbish and even though I personally feel like I\u2019m attractive (at least appearance wise) I haven\u2019t ever had sex or dated though I\u2019m going to be 23 this year. \nThe only people who\u2019ve ever shown interest in me are creepy men who wanted to use me for my body and I\u2019m a repeat victim of sexual assault which just makes it harder for me to approach people or trust them. \n\nBut the single life isn\u2019t all that bad. It\u2019s hard to appreciate it a lot of the times but I also know I\u2019m not healthy enough emotionally to cope with a relationship so I use this as an opportunity to learn to love myself and feel secure and content with myself. \nAs I said I\u2019m not single out of choice at all. But I don\u2019t think being single is a bad thing. \n\nBeing single and feeling lonely are different and I\u2019ve learnt over time that a relationship is never going to fix all the hatred and resentment I have towards myself and others. It\u2019s not going to make me feel less lonely or unhappy. And if I date I want to date a person because I love them, not because I want them to be my therapist and fix all my problems. \n\nI know it feels like rubbish and it\u2019s really tough. I really do. But I also know because of years of therapy and reading my self help book and taking medications that companionship isn\u2019t going to fix anything if I\u2019m not willing to work on myself. So maybe being single isn\u2019t the best thing in the world for a lonely person. But it\u2019s not the worst thing either because it gives you opportunities to learn and grow and better yourself and feel more comfortable with yourself. \nWe just gotta make that effort.",

They do not sound like \"old creeps\" to me.",

                            "comment": "It\u2019s not like you would just date any girl you\u2019re not into either right? \nHe is the only one who has ever been nice \n\nAnd when I say interest I mean interest I ended up reciprocating which led me to being raped and badly emotionally abused, mind you. \n\nBut consent never factors in. Except for this one guy who was nice but I just wasn\u2019t into, everyone has just been a creep. \nI\u2019ve been harassed for saying no and sexually abused for consenting. \n\nWhen I said no one has shown internet I mean no men have shown interest who I wanted to be with as well. And those who have were lying because they wanted to physically use me. \n\nYou don\u2019t know the half of it. Relationships don\u2019t fix shit and on top of everything people like me also have to keep making sure people aren\u2019t predators. \n\nThose brief periods where I was being manipulated and thought I had a shot at a relationship actually made my mental health significantly worse instead of better. \n\nAnd also just saying \u201cnice\u201d isn\u2019t a personality. It\u2019s the bare minimum you would expect another person to be. I don\u2019t need to date someone because they didn\u2019t rape me and harass me for saying no. \n\nSo please don\u2019t accuse me of lying and find justifications for why you need to wallow in self pity your whole life when all I did was try to help and encourage you. \n\nYou wanting to permanently believe there\u2019s nothing good in the world doesn\u2019t give you the right to keep arbitrary standards to define the suffering of others. Just because ONE guy who knew what consent means was into me doesn\u2019t make my life perfect or any less lonely. \n\nBut sure relationships are the epicentre of the universe and not something shoved down your throat by the media and society to make you feel like you\u2019re worthless without one, and anyone who tells you different is obviously a liar. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have self worth you are just going to drag any relationship partner you have down. And you don\u2019t have self worth at all which is why you think just anybody would do and don\u2019t take consent or reciprocation into account.\nYour partner is not going to be your therapist and magically fix your problems and if you date without fixing your self worth issues and while putting so much importance on the relationship, it will just be toxic for you and your partner both.\n\nDownvote me and call me a liar and whatever else but the fact of the matter is a relationship won\u2019t fix anything unless you are able to love yourself from within, and I pray you don\u2019t find out this out the hard way.",

I appreciate your clarifications though, i don't hold negative feelings towards you (I don't know you), I'm poiting out that your previous comment did in fact includie a lie.\n\nI got violently assaulted by one of my friends in the past, and got violently assaulted many many times at high school (fractured leg one time,, fractures wrist another time), this doesn't mean I didn't have positive friendships. I was happy before experiencing dozens and doezens of rejections, I'm not alone because I chose to, I'm alone because they are disgusted by me. Your previous experience proves you can attract someone and if someone even fell love in love with you (love is a big word) I'm sure there are many other people who would at least fancy you.\n\nMe? If a girl was compatible enough with me that I could see her as a close friend, I'd  aboslutely date her, there are very few girls I wouldn't date because they do not meet my staardards, just be a friend and you got a shot. I'm not a choosing beggar but it's okay to to choose to not date someone because they don't meet our attraction standards, I wouldn't consider you \"lonely\" though, more like \"alone\" which is a way better condition.\n\nEDIT: I didn't downvote your previous comment, other redditors did.",

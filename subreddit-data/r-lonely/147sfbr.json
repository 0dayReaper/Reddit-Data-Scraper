    "postText": "I\u2019ve always wanted the most out of life, but it\u2019s all falling apart. I\u2019m so empty and exhausted. I keep coming here because there\u2019s literally no one or nothing else to go to. I feel like a waste of breath. I\u2019ve never dated anyone and I keep seeing things that remind me of that and things that tell me how it\u2019s supposed to be when I actually do that make me not want to do it. Not because it\u2019s scary but because I hate when it seems like things are supposed to be a certain way or your weird or not doing it right (because I then do things that I think I\u2019m doing on my own . \n\nDue to being so alone and having time to think about why I am the way I am has made me realize my life is so much different than others. I always knew I was different and if anything it\u2019s always added to what little confidence I had but now it\u2019s become more of an issue than an advantage. I hate myself now. The way I look, the way I talk the way I have no one who understands me or no one who I can truly be myself with. I wake up to nothingness. I ponder on things that made me who I am and put me in this position of desolation. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. My literal problem is having no one who can match my energy: friend or otherwise. I want to talk to a therapist or something but I already feel pitiful enough as is. My entire life is embarrassing and I\u2019ve tried to keep my loneliness hidden but it\u2019s beginning to show. I hate home because it\u2019s just me and my (starting to think late menopause or bipolar) mother, who does nothing but nag and complain about me being lazy and laying around and accuses me of things like being an alcoholic or having sex but doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m not lazy im unmotivated to live let alone stand up. College is better but worse in a way because I went to a tiny school I never wanted to go to that felt like highschool and I couldn\u2019t be in my room and mind my business and all I did was sleep eat and shit around people who I felt judged me all day. \u201cyou\u2019re a virgin ???\u201d \u201cdo you go anywhere??\u201d \u201cgirl you don\u2019t ever leave this room\u201d. On top of already being depressed. And because it\u2019s literally a tiny school there\u2019s only so many new people to meet and make a new impression upon.\n\nTrying to go to the gym to finally embark on goals I\u2019ve had since I was 12 and knew I could grow glutes in the gym. Only reason I even looked into it is because of JUDGEMENT of being flat. But I even found out it reduces stress and depression so that was a plus and I\u2019m on day three, but even that is being ruined by people. I feel like people keep staring and being JUDGMENTAL. My problem isn\u2019t rape or heart break or bankruptcy or car accidents, it\u2019s that I don\u2019t have any. And I feel as though I literally have no need to be here. I think my fear of judgement and being so a lone is the reason I\u2019m such a people pleaser. It might be all in my head but I\u2019m starting to get closer and closer to the end. I literally just want to live and do things idc if I have to rob a store atp I just want to be happy. Or at least that\u2019s what I wanted. Now I really just want to dissolve from the timeline.",

So if theres any advice i can try to give you is that maybe you just need to focus in yourself and doing the things you love for a bit, try to get better mentally before you try anything else maybe? \n\nIf you don\u2019t you might get heavily attached to the first thing or person that shows up and makes you feel like all your problems are solved and honestly thats all laughs and games until something bad happens and you relapse but worse. I wish i had better advice to give im sorry, but if you need anything don\u2019t hesitate to ask!",

            "comment": "It gets better when you have more active challenges in your life than passive ones. An active challenge is one that you decide for yourself, like I want to go to the gym. A passive challenge is one you didn't invite and don't particularly enjoy like your mom telling you to clean your room or having to pay taxes. The combined retort is not that challenges need to go away, but that you need to set more challenges for yourself. Like, I wanna talk to at least one girl and at least one boy for 10 minutes today or I want to spend at least 5 minutes helping others today. Anything that is self determined as a challenge will help you feel your life getting better.",

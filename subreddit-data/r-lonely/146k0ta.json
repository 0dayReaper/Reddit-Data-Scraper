    "postText": "So I had a date about almost a month ago, and I don\u2019t even know why it still bugs me, but it does and I hate it. It went so well, until it didn\u2019t. He basically ghosted me, because I wouldn\u2019t put out. And I thought he was better than that, and that he and I were going to work out. I\u2019m honestly just thinking of giving up on dating as a whole. I\u2019m a 21 year woman, so I know how crazy that sounds. But is it really?",

However, since you're 21, I would encourage you not to give up just yet. \n\nYou should still take a break if needed. I'm sorry you were mistreated like that.",

    "postText": "So there is a college trip organized in our college. Me and my friends decided to go on the trip. So the tickets were sold out in a moment. So me and one of my friend only got a ticket. I heard him say behind my back that I don't wanna go with him, he is boring af. I felt that so bad and I just felt like dying at that moment. One of my other friend is also losing intrest in me as now we have different classes and dosen't talk to me anymore. Just wanted someone to think that I am intresting.",

Go on the trip and enjoy it yourself, with or without this \"friend\", you might have a better time solo! Find people that value you for what you are as a person so you can build proper relationships instead of those that speak ill of you behind your back.\n\nAs for your other friend, maybe invite them out for a drink, movie or something you used to do, if they dont reciprocate by inviting you out later on, don't bother as friendship aint a one-way street. \n\nPeople will find you interesting for many reasons, good or bad. Like everyone else you need to find those who are interested for good reasons, jump out of your comfort zone and speak to those you usually wouldn't. Rejection in all forms will lead to success eventually!\n\nFeel free to DM.\n\nTake care of yourself.",

I really don\u2019t wish to say anything about this bc each time I think of it I feel hurt.\n     I met him few months ago, we got to know each other better than I had expected he was so nice so I felt I had met the perfect man for myself until his wife called raining insults on me someday and bc it\u2019s wrong to date someone\u2019s husband even though I\u2019ve decided to stay away from him hence it\u2019s true his married, till then I\u2019ve found solace in soul music bc that\u2019s way I feel my healing comes from.\n\n\nMy question is,  what do I do since this man keeps checking up and telling me how much he  loves me, the truth is am not gonna give him an opportunity to come into my life again but am seeking your opinions. Thanks",

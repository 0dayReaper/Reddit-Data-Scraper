    "postText": "6 months ago , I thought I had everything. And then came the heartbreak and my world collapsed. I realised I had no friends. I was alone, very alone. For the first time in life I felt that I had no one. I had lost all my friends in the pursuit of that \"love\". But she ended up breaking my heart. I turned 21 last month and this was the loneliest birthday that I have ever spent. \nIn the last 6 months I did try forging new friendships and revive my old ones but I feel I failed miserably at that. I feel my old friends have moved on from me, despite them saying otherwise and my new friends already have their own group. \nI want to get better, I want to start anew but right now I just am running away, as fast as I can from the emotions, from the pain. I wish I had someone I could talk to, I wish I had someone I could tell my achievements my goals to, someone I could share my dreams with. \nI am not looking for a gf, that's the last thing I am looking for. I also am not looking for someone i can share my pain with. I am not that person, I prefer keeping me to myself, atleast all my negative feelings. I just want a friend to talk good things with or listen to, am a great listener. Maybe me 4 years ago would have told you that love is everything, but now idk if I ever wanna love again cause am scared to be honest. So nah no gf.\nI just want someone to be there when I walk this road, I don't want to do it alone. I know I will do great once I get to it. I know I am smart and I'll be someone big one day, I just need to start again. I need to take my steps. \nIt's been long since I opened up my heart like this to anyone. Even if I don't get any response on this, I make a promise to myself that I will walk that road even if it's alone. I'll revisit this post in a year and hopefully I will be in a better place by then.\n\nI am not weak, and I know I can do this, and I will make a comeback. I will again be the same old me but even much better. Ah I know maybe 2 years down the line I myself will think it's all so much cringe but nah man. This is reality and this is you opening up.",

I\u2019ve had a bad week, and I just wanna dissolve into my bed and stay there. And I know I can\u2019t, but I wish I could. I don\u2019t know why I feel so lonely, it\u2019s so stupid that I feel this way. I don\u2019t like to be vulnerable, but I just feel like I\u2019m never gonna meet someone to be with.",

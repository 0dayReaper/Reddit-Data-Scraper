    "postText": "When I was younger I had no problem making friends or interacting with other people but now it feels like that was a completely different me. I didn\u2019t care about what people thought or get a racing heart because I was about to enter a social situation. I have no true friends offline, I work a solo job that isn\u2019t doing so well, I\u2019m not in touch with my family and I hate going outside. I want to be loved. I want to get married. I want to be successful. I want to have kids or maybe not. I want to travel. I want to lay naked on a beach in santorini. I want to be a designer. I have so many dreams but one obstacle that I just can\u2019t defeat and it\u2019s draining me. I\u2019m aware of so many things now and I hate it. I want to go back to being secure in my ignorance. I want to do the things I used to do so easily because being socially anxiety is ruining me.",

There is hope to become what you were",

The only way things have gotten better is by pushing back, and consciously doing small things I have been avoiding.  Its just like going for a walk when even a few steps make you winded.  The only way it gets better is with consistent effort. Its exhausting. \n\nOne thing that has been helping me lately is propranolol.  it helps reduce some of the physical symptoms of anxiety and keeps me from spiraling when things get uncomfortable.",

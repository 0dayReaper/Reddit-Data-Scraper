Which is pretty ridiculous because frankly, I haven't been that close to another person since I was a kid. I don't get how it works, it's not natural to me. If I ever had the opportunity, I'm sure I'd mess it up. \n\nSuch a shitty coping mechanism, but it's impossible to avoid escaping into fantasy every so often.",

Whether you fantasize about love, sex, money.. and all these things that we constantly see over and over again on the internet/tv. It is really difficult to battle these temptations, and yes; it feels really good to fantasize because it is the perfect scenario that our brain is asking for and we are capable of imagining it down to the tiniest details.  \n\n\nNow in terms of your sleep schedule, if you have an iphone ALWAYS turn dark mode on at night, it removes the blue light from the screen which won't interfere with your melatonin levels. I'm not sure whether other phones like samsung have this feature but there must be an app for it. Theres also f.lux for desktop and laptops which is a great softgware that automatically regulates the blue light as time reaches evening (according to your timezone).  \n\n\nNevertheless, you can always buy anti blue glasses to prevent blue light coming from anywhere such as LED lights in the house, TV screens, mobile phones, laptops.. basically any electronic device from nowadays.. (i would recommend [adantiglasses.com](https://adantiglasses.com) they're really good my wife has bought them and i think they've helped her a lot).  \n\n\nAlways take care of your sleep, it's as important as eating and drinking! I'm glad you're aware of your issue so now it's much easier to find a solution.",

Have you taken an economics class ever?\n\nThree: This sounds like the ideology of a starving man. Ms. CVS and I [yes I am throwing myself in here] only like the finest of meat and we only eat when we have the means to procure only the best; if we subscribe to your logic, we should be scooping up every bologna sandwich in the interim just to stay fed. I beg to differ. Time spent on metaphorical bologna sandwiches could be spent on ourselves or in the environments that offer metaphorical filet mignon. \n\nSo don't come at Ms. CVS with your ad hominem \"even worse\" B.S.\n\nI have spoken.",

    "postText": "I am very ungrateful for saying this. And I understand that I tend to use Reddit as a shout into the void. If this is the wrong subreddit for this kind of post I\u2019ll delete it. \n\nMy main problem comes from trust issues which mean I can barely form a connection with anyone I am close to. My parents are very kind, but I feel like they only love the image I show them of myself. My friends are nice too, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that they don\u2019t like me and want me gone, because all of my other \u2018friends\u2019 have done this. I understand I may be the common denominator in this. But I\u2019m tired. One of them said he probably wouldn\u2019t miss me if I didn\u2019t speak to him, which really caused me to spiral. Other friend (through no fault of his own, not pointing fingers) tends to give one word responses when I try to talk about my issues. My sibling gaslights me, manipulates me and mocks me for things I do, especially when I laugh. They have autism so it is hard for them to understand why I am upset, but if I try to bring up the fact they are being hurtful I get told to stop \u2018pushing my ideals\u2019 on them. A few years ago I dated someone who gave me these issues in the first place. He sexually abused me, and I put my all into the relationship while he used me for what he wanted. However he was kind sometimes and I find myself missing him. \n\nBecause if all this I feel incredibly alone. I feel like no one wants to know who I actually am and I feel like a huge burden on my family. People tell me that genuine friendships will come with time, but I have been waiting and waiting and trying to be what people want for too long. I\u2019m done at this point. If you read all this, thank you. Have a great day or night.",

Otherwise, I hope you are able to get away from those abusers. Also, being autistic is not an excuse to be an asshole or abusive.",

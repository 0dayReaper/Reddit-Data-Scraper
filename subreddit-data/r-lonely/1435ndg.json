    "postText": "If you told me 7 months ago or my birthday I'll be lonely as hell I'd be like you're crazy.\nSo I lost my wife in January.i was with her for 25 years it wasn't a perfect marriage but it was a happy marriage for the most part and now she's not here it's so weird.\nI seriously feel really lonely now. For 25 years I had someone next to me all the time I loved it I wouldn't trade it for the world but now I have nothing.i hate it so much I understand people die part of life I get us but now I'm 47 I don't want to be alone for the rest of my life\nWell there's is me venting",

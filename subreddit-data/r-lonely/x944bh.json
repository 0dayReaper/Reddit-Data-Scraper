    "postText": "She was taking a test. And then it was my turn. When I was going to her desk, she asked something to the whole class. \"Is she always this silent?\".Everybody said yes. Then she asked me, multiple times the same question. I said no but I wasn't audible. I wasn't speaking. I was just moving my mouth because I was nervous and when I'm nervous I cannot speak audibly. This fueled the situation even more. She asked me one more time the same question before moving on to the test as I had the same answer which was no. She asked me the question for the test and I was able to answer it. I thought it died down but then as I was going back to my seat, she asked me \"Who is your best friend?\". I did not answer till I reached my desk and when I did and got in, I answered \"No one\" She then started to ask me a ton of questions with concern. \"Do you seriously not have a single friend in this class of 65?!\", \"Are you uncomfortable with your classmates?\", \"Do you not like your classmates\"?, \"What about your bench mate?\" The girl I was sitting to was not my friend. We never talk and I just met her this year. And I can guarantee she dislikes me too. So, I didn't answer. If I would have said yes, it would be a total lie and I hate lies like that and if I would have said no, it would seem rude. She then started lecturing me on how friends was very important. \"This is not your age to be so reserved. You need to open up more, speak more. What if you need help one day in the future but you have no one to call up?\" and so on. \nI was about to cry and she noticed it. She asked me \"Now, why are you crying?\" I did not answer. I did manage to hold my tears in and she kept on going on. Then finally, she told me to try to make friends and let me sit down. Everybody kept staring at me. \nShe saw me yesterday, sitting alone on the floor in a corner away from others in our lunch break time. I was studying. And that's why she probably called me out but I know she's going to tell this to every teacher now and they're all going to call me out. I don't wan to leave my house even more now.",

I understand if you're afraid of mentioning it, but in my view, it's the best thing to do. \n\nIt is interesting though, for the older generation; I think our age group is the most lonely and unsocialable, lol.

My advice is this, people tend to have pretty short memories and although it was mortifying and awful for you, the scene etched in your mind- for the other classmates, it was probably not very memorable and i'm sure many of them (if they are at all human) actually feel bad for you but too inexperienced and intimidated to stand up to the teacher. This will pass, but the teacher can't continue to humiliate you or anyone else like this, zero tact. To get through this awful time in your life (which will pass, I promise) you're gonna need to understand just that, this is temporary and these people will not likely be around you for the rest of your life. If you are able to find 1 good friend naturally there, they will surmount the value of 1000 just meh ok friends. Do your best with the school work and immerse yourself in the things you enjoy and interest you (eg. books, music, etc). All we can ever do in this lonely world is try to be a better version of ourselves than we were yesterday, follow our joy and curiosity, and not destroy ourselves or anyone else in the process.

It would be helpful to know what age you are to help you best proceed but I think you need someone to help advocate and speak up for you to a higher authority within the school. That could be a parent, family member, or some similar person. If you can\u2019t think of someone or don\u2019t have someone you trust, you could probably write a statement to send to an authority about this and at the very least be removed from her class. If you need help writing some sort of a statement I would be more than happy to help you out- I\u2019m oddly good at this sort of thing!

You don\u2019t deserve that. Even if your classmates find you quiet or odd or something I can almost guarantee you many probably felt uncomfortable or bad about what your teacher did to you. It makes HER look like a pos. Not you. Many of the most brilliant people in history have been reserved quiet or even outcasts (not saying that\u2019s you but still) and so the fact that you\u2019re quiet and keep to yourself doesn\u2019t diminish your value or your abilities at all.

By some dumb luck, something like this happened to me today (luckily in a class of 36. He singled me out in the middle of his lecture and told me I was \"too shy\" and \"overly timid\"). I hope your teacher learned her mistake, and it won't happen again",

It\u2019s not encouraging at all. I\u2019m sorry you went through this, just know you deserve to be respected much better than that.",

He started doing this 1 month ago and never stopped. I\u2019m so lonely I always have a bad day and no one knows. This ruined my mental health, know I\u2019m depressed that I start to cry in front of everyone but they don\u2019t care. I feel so unsafe in his classroom and I don\u2019t ever want leave my home ever again. So I guess we have something in common.",

            "comment": "Some people shouldn't be teachers. Don't let her get to you. Just remember the time you spend in school is fleeting and passes by. You could report that teacher for humiliating you if you want. \n\nYou must remember, school is a very short period of time in life. You'll get passed it and won't have to see those people anymore. Even if at the time it feels like an eternity. When older 2, 4, 6 years all pass so much faster. Twice the speed they did as a teen.\n\nI was bullied in school. I did make friends but they weren't the super popular people, we were what you'd call the misfits. No other group liked us. So in many classes I didn't have friends if they weren't in them. I was quiet and I ignored people as if I tried to interact with those I wasn't getting along with, it led to bullying, which in the late 2000s and very early 2010s was just ignored and accepted by teaching staff.\n\nMy history teacher was what you'd call a narcissistic personality. He was middle aged, single and living out his school glory days at 40 something. It was an all boys school so he was acting like \"one of the lads\", clinging to his youth.\n\nHe would laugh when the students made fun of other students etc or just ignore it. No repercussions for bad behaviour. Unless you insulted him in which case he would destroy you.\n\nWhen my mom went to the parent teacher meeting one year and he said to her \"your son is quite the loner isn't he, hes a bit odd\". My mother was taken aback by the comment but never even defended me as she was so shook up he'd say that to her.\n\nShe asked me if I was a loner and if people didn't like me etc when home. I knew which one of my teacher had to have said it and immediately made clear I hated everyone in his class very much and him. She remained concerned however about me which was annoying for a long time, but I get why she was.\n\nThat damn teacher done damage by saying that. Of course this was in 2009, so the world has changed a lot since then and teachers can't get away with things anymore if called out. Being a teenager back then they could treat us like crap and we just had to  accept it. \n\nI would reccomend you make a complaint about this teacher if they ever make you uncomfortable again. My teacher back then didn't belong in a classroom setting, but was sadly. Hes likely sti teaching too, which sickens me. Hed me mid to late 50s now. Today you can prevent them from being like that. They will be sanctioned for humiliating you. \n\nDon't let this get to you though. All this crap will make you stronger when older. You'll be more than able to ignore and put up with people who are trying to upset or provoke you as an adult. As there are always bad apples, just less when older. That's what I've been able to do, no one pushes me over anymore as I became strong from what i endured in school. As an adult, what I learned from the behaviour of people who mistreated me back then has allowed me to navigate rude and deliberately ignorant people today.",

The teacher implied that OP should be an outgoing extrovert. While we may want OP to have an improved social life, as she herself indicates, nobody should be demanding a total rewrite of their personality. It\u2019s entirely possible to be more introverted and have a fulfilling social life.\n3. OP isn\u2019t male, she is referred to with female pronouns throughout. Not that this makes much difference to the case. It is inappropriate regardless.",

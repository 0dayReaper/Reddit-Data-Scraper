    "postText": "Woke up at 4AM, reached gym by 5.\nPT wasn\u2019t much talkative, mostly gave me workouts and left me alone by myself,\nTo talk to others at the gym. I finished by 6.45AM. Was dismissed promptly.\nI was bursting to talk about something. Forgot it lol. \nI should try again.\n\nCame home. Mom was busy in the kitchen. \nMostly was on the phone with one of my aunts. \nI forgot what it was that I wanted to talk about,\nIt\u2019ll come to me eventually, I\u2019m sure! I\u2019ll try again.\n\nHey its a text from ass.prof. I worked under.\nTalking after a long time, even though he left me on read,\nthe last time I texted him.\nOh he needs some kinda favour from my father regarding his work.\nAnd then he left. Oh well, he must be busy to listen to me. I\u2019ll try again sometime later.\n\nMy father came to my room, only to give me some few errands,\nWell he\u2019s always on the phone, always work-minded. \nHe left. But meanwhile I forgot what it was that I wanted to talk about,\nI\u2019ll try later when he\u2019s free!\n\nOh my friend called!. Picked up only to listen to him talk about,\nWell, his life basically. He was done talking but suddenly left for lunch.\nI\u2019ll try to talk to him later and say whatever I was gonna say.\nExcept he doesn\u2019t pick my calls anymore. Does only when I\u2019m needed. Strange.\n\nAnother friend texted me yay! Oh he wants some fast cash. Given that he already has \nNot returned some cash, I declined to help him. He left.\n\nYay my best friend texted me after ghosting me for a week. Poor girl is going to a new job \nIn a new place. She was ranting on and on about how the whole situation was shitty.\nBad apt, bad food, bad colleagues and a toxic boss. I was bursting to tell her how I was doing the past few weeks.\nShe was gone. Turns out she went to eat and just \u2018forgot\u2019 about me. She\u2019s busy with work I guess.\nI\u2019ll try later when she\u2019s got some down time. \n\nWell I wish I had people who will actually lend me their ears for a moment. Not much. Just a couple of minutes. \nI\u2019m jobless now and my college starts after 3 months. It hurts so much. To have no one to talk to. \n\nI just lay on the bed, watching the ceiling fan spin. I make up fantasy scenarios and imagine that I\u2019m living \nThe colourful life I always yearned for. I can grab anyone\u2019s attention. A social butterfly! There\u2019s even this cute girl\nWho seems to like me. And we start talking! \n\nMy head hurts and my eyes heavy and burning with all the tears. I down some DXM syrup and klonopin and pass out.\n\nA wonderful day to die!",

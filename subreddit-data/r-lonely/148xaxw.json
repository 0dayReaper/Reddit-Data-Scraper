Don't restrict it to your age group, be open to talking to everyone.\n\nHow to start? It can be \"what's the exercise you're doing rn?\", \"Can you see if I am doing this properly?\", \"Can I share this bar/machine with you?\"\n\nIn between sets, just make small talk. It can even be like, \"fuck, I'm glad covid is a thing of the past now\"\n\"How did you continue working out at home? Do you have a set routine?\"\n\nIdk what to do if ppl hits on you tho. So uh.. can try making another post asking for help when that happens.",

Meeting people and making friends is just really hard to do working out at the gym or at home reading. Group oriented hobbies are much better for this.\n\nWithout doing that, best thing I can think of is book club or discord groups for reading.",

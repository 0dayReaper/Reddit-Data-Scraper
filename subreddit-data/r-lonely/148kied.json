Talk more and be \"engaging\" (but hey, don't sweat about it, or you'll just give yourself a headache). And of course, let the other person share a bit too.   \nYou share something silly, they share something silly. Etc.   \nWe're having a conversation, if I'm gonna be the only one sharing details or simply telling you about my day, I'd feel awkward. In fact, I'd assume they're not interested in cultivating a friendship and they're replying to be polite or out of boredom.  \nAt least, that's how I feel about it.",

When you do not give enough input into the conversation you make the other person feel as though they are not explaining themselves well and just keep talking. \n\nIt's not a nice way to chat generally as you are putting the onus on them to move everything along.\n\nBut idk maybe no one listens to them usually..",

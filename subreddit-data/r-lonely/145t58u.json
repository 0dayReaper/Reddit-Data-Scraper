    "postText": "I won tickets (for the first time in my life) for me and a +1, but I can\u2019t find anyone to go with. I\u2019ve never been to a concert alone (2 hours away , 1 way) it feels like it will be a long drive there alone. I hate driving in the city and love having a passenger as my second pair of eyes. \n \nI\u2019ve been going to shows for the past five or six years. I normally go with friends, or with a group of people with the last show I went to my best friend broke it to me that she\u2019s not really a fan of concerts. It felt very out of the blue because we\u2019ve been to multiple shows before. I understand that the noise, crowd, heat, etc. Could be irritating/make the show less enjoyable. \n\nI might be selfish for thinking this, but I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t have many friends (her + her bf, and 2 co workers) are my only friends. Me and my coworkers don\u2019t have the same music taste. I know it\u2019s ideal to go to a concert of a musician that you know/listen to, but I\u2019ve been to plenty of shows where I didn\u2019t know who was playing and had a blast. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m wanting to go to these giant big-name festivals. Ive always offer to drive / pay (if they can\u2019t afford it) and rarely ask for gas money. For some people that would be the dream set up. I just don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t find other people to hang out with me. \n\nEither way, I\u2019m not wasting my possibly only opportunity to go to a show for free, i just wish it didn\u2019t feel so lonely.\n\nEdit: sorry if this post seems really out of order, it\u2019s currently 2 AM where I\u2019m at and I\u2019m sleepy.",

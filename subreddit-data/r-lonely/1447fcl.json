    "postText": "Now that most of my friends are away (I'm staying in the town where my uni is to concentrate for exams whilst many of them prefer to stay home) I realize how utterly undesirable I am, and I'm done with it.\n\nCall me entitled, whatever, but I actually cannot fathom the fact that not a single girl in this university town with 65% of the 30000 students being female and not a single fucking one of them wants to have lunch with me like I used to with my friends. I'm just in awe. What do women even want, seriously. I'm 6', blue eyes, have better physique than 90% of dudes my age, I literally find sexually attractive 60% of women my age and I'm not even kidding. That makes it more than 10000 potential people I would be down to to have something sexual with for some time or even just fucking company of some sort, not even the sexual kind. \n\nIt has gotten to the point where I seriously don't know how attractive I am. Women have shown so little interest in me both sexually and romantically I don't even know wether I'm a 7 or a 2.5. I literally don't know. Like I have had more sexual partners (10) than the average guy has at my age (I think?) yet I feel like I'm massively unsuccessful because I've had to try a million fucking times to get there. \nI would meet someone, right, they get into bed with me then dissapear after a couple of weeks talking and meeting with 0 explanation. Doesn't matter wether I've talked about my feelings, how attractive she is. It doesn't. I thought it was men who did that. Well as I live IN FUCKING INVERSE WORLD I somehow get the short end of both sticks.\nIt's like I get as many opportunities as a man, and those opportunities are the same quality as a woman would get.\n\nI've finally uninstalled Tinder because standards there are utterly fucking ridiculous for women. Did I get something out of it? I guess you could say so? But it isn't fucking worth it to try among a hundred chicks that aren't really that attractive to me, both physically and personally. Like for the love of god, I'm asking for her not to be severely overweight, even just a bit is fine. I guess that's too much to ask for a person that has built a really solid physique with two years of hard and consistent training. Even they fucking ghost me anyway like it's not funny anymore dear universe. I ask for the bare fucking minimum and receive way less than that. Online dating is absolute nonsense for men, it's ridiculous what I have to offer for so little in return.\n \nAnd you know what? Fuck it I'm going to say it. I am better than most of the chicks that would show interest in me. I don't care if I sound like an asshole, maybe I am an asshole but I'm sick of pretending I deserve people that are way less inteligent than me and have put 0 effort into the most basic thing that is not being obese. I deserve better even if it's literally impossible for any woman like that to show interest in me. I'm not going to be the second plate of some chick that failed highschool and is a 4/10. Even if those women are the only ones that will pay attention to me online. \n\nI'm just astounded that it has gotten to this point. A point in which I've tried so fucking hard and it has all been in vain. I am seriously done. I've uninstalled Tinder and I've decided not to reach out to women that won't do the same for me (which means every single one of them, guess I'm not worth a reply every 24 hours).\n\nI am a villain, the world has made me this way. I am a bad person. I hate the fact that no woman has ever put in minimal effort towards me. I guess I'm that rare kind of incel that has had more sex than the average person. I am in tears, I don't want to be this way, I really do not. I've tried everything not to generalize women. I am physically unable not to be biased. I am a piece of shit. Right now it's impossible for me to feel empathy towards women's suffering in relationships. All I think about when I hear it is \"why would you date a drug addict/someone that has no direction in life/is unattractive and then complain when it goes wrong. Why not me, I wouldn't do that\". I know I'm an asshole, but I subconsciously can't take away that thought from my brain.\n\nI love the girls at Physics, they're my family. Like I don't even know if all of this means I'm a misogynist or not? I don't feel women are inferior. They are just out to ignore me and make me suffer as much as possible as soon as they're not exclusively family or friends. It's like the universe bends as soon as I have a mere sexual or romantic thought about a woman to make every interaction with her pure pain. \n\nI'm just lost, I know I need professional help and thankfully I think my family would be supportive of that idea, so I'll just ask them to arrange something with a psychologist. I don't know. I've tried my hardest to be everything that someone would want, and it's not enough to get someone that clearly way way way below that standard. I'm done. The harder I try the more resentful I've become.",

            "comment": "I get why you feel this way, but ask yourself, if you were looking for a partner, would you look for someone who is all together or someone who feels inferior or broken? Some girls like a project, but most people want a partner. I myself dont want to be a burden to someone and I feel like you wouldnt want that either. You have a lot of stress and other things going on, so you may have to organize and learn some coping skills before you worry about the dating scene. Just think of the qualities you value, and what you actually want in a partner. Desperation and loneliness tend to be off putting and concerning to new people. So, set some goals, learn some new skills, and break down your life and how you could make it easier. You deserve to be happy and have people around you, but no one person is obligated to fill that need. People make a big deal about being an \"incel\", but not having sex when you dont have a partner or going through a dry spell is perfectly normal. Its not reasonable for society to put such pressure on guys in general, when the boundaries of what is acceptable changes by the day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDont make yourself a villian. Its okay to have standards or want to be with someone who fits your lifestyle and morals. But, your lack of a partner doesnt give you free reign to complain about others or women in general. First off, its a waste of your time, and second, it may be your expectations and attitude that need some adjusting. You also may be looking in the wrong place for a partner. Women are attracted to many things, but negativity usually isnt one of them. You may need to check your ego and honestly just try working internally before you look for someone. Because it doesnt matter how attractive you are, if your attitude and behavior is garbage. Im not saying you are a bad guy or deserve to be alone, but I think you have a lot of self improvement to do before someone looks at you as their potential future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish you luck man, I know its easy to slip into the negative, but just like excercise, internal self improvement comes through analysis and struggle. Changes dont come quick or easy, but honest self introspection helps you check yourself and your own ideas of worth. Do your best",

                    "comment": "This sincerely feels like a well put analysis, and I know it logically makes sense, I'm just beyond help right now. I had kind of a mental breakdown earlier as I've been locked inside the library for 4 days basically. I probably should just pass my subjects before caring about all of this shit. \n\nIt's kind of sad forcing yourself to let go after you've tried your absolute hardest to achieve something, and you know you can actually get there if it depended on you it's just it always falls into the hands of others to my dismay. \n\nI had a week and a half long \"\"\"relationship\"\"\" 6 months ago and it's been a wild ride seeing this massively downward trend I'm following. \nBecause you know, with me I can't have anything good in life, so as soon as I was absolutely ready to devote myself to getting to know someone without fucking around she cheated on me the first chance she got. The worst part is that I didn't even get to develop feelings for her it was that fucking early into us meeting and getting together lol. I like to think I was a good boyfriend, I certainly was the happiest I've ever been pretty much.\n\nI know you can't depend on someone yadayadayada. But truth is, feeling capable of loving and being loved for the first time in my whole life would've actually helped a ton with my self esteem and happiness as a consequence. But hey, it's me so why the fuck would I get a chance at being happy lol. It feels like every time I'm in the perfect position for everything to work, nothing does. \n\nThanks for reading my rant anyway, wether I'm beyond saving or not an absolute fact is I need to take time off, delete every single contact with women that isn't satisfying (so any girl I met online lol). I need to try to be happy without any female attention, because I ain't getting none any time soon.\n\nI don't think introspection will do me any good. I'm clearly not capable of figuring out what's wrong with me and fixing it. I guess my self improvement would consist of taking drugs to improve my mood probably, because I already do the usual stuff every guru salesman self help guy tells you to do. So a psychologist is the most reasonable thing I guess. Negativity is hard to suppress when it's almost core to your beliefs, but that's another can of worms. I think it's just being myself is unattractive probably. Do I really want to give up what makes me just for love, not sure about that one. \n\nAlso the argument about thinking if I would like another person that is like me in this way doesn't work. Because I actually would lol. \nI know if I want to get in the average woman's pants it isn't going to work but goddam if I wouldn't like to have a deep conversation about hatred, fear, self esteem and negative thoughts with a girl. \n\nI know that I would like it because I actually am enjoying something like that right now, we're just exclusively friends for the foreseeable future. \n\nAnd that's the thing that frustrates me. If I find an intelligent, attractive chick I would damn well tolerate a conversation I abhor because I like what's beneath the surface. I already do plenty of times, but that's my most grave mistake: thinking that others think like I do. Would I give myself I chance if I were a woman? Yes I would, I'm already really interested in someone that is like this as I said, it's just that we aren't that attracted to eachother unfortunately, so just friends. But I've got to learn that that isn't the case for most people, and it's really really hard to accept. \n\nFor most people, it seems that two semi uncomfortable messages and you're already not worth being given an opportunity at redemption. I find that so utterly shallow. Like yes I could improve, but do I really have to be perfect just for a chance with some below average chick that will bore me to death with meaningless chatter and a generic personality.\n\nI just wish it wasn't that hard to just find someone to have sex with and that's it, I thought dating apps would be the solution but yeah, nah, wish it worked but it doesn't unless I lower my standards to the ground, no decently attractive girl will ever match with me because of how it works, and that's fine. Really I think I just may be a little off in regards to how attractive I am probably. Like yeah, there are some characteristics that I can objectively assess, but face aesthetics isn't one of them. It'd be actually kind of cathartic to realize one day that it's just that I am quite subpar in terms of beauty and that's actually why normal girls don't find me attractive and the source of all my suffering, it's probably just that at the end of the day lmao, like yeah I might be fit and semi tall but it means fuck all if you're not good looking. \n\nWell that's enough writing for the rest of my existence. You're a real warrior if you read this, even if you don't you're a nice guy dude.",

                            "comment": "I feel you man, I appreciate you replying. Nothing is hopeless, but you gotta believe that for yourself. I myself struggle with moderate to severe depression , and its been a bit since my last relationship. So, I get that want for an intelligent and just close relationship. My last partner was more intelligent than she acted, because it was easier for her to live that way. It frustrated me to no end to see her live in such a way, but I honestly miss having a partner and just having some ability to connect with someone. I myself struggle with my own feelings of unworthiness, isolation, and overall just lack of connection. So, do i agree with everything you said? No. Do you have a right to be upset and feel frustrated about your situation? Absolutely. I just feel like it will pass at some point. You have a brain,  your frustration and pain fade with time. And maybe relax on yourself and the selftalk. Have you ever asked yourself what you like about yourself? If you cant answer it, make it up, and use those as goals. Tell yourself those things over and over until you believe it. Its not a demand, but if you really want something, sometimes you gotta try things that sounds stupid and simple. But sometimes those simple ideas work. Also, You didnt deserve to be cheated on, and you do deserve to be happy as well. So, i hope you find a turning point someday soon.\n\nAnd I did read all of what you said. I appreciate you laying it out, i may not like some things, but i have to respect that its your choice and that you need to want to make changes for them to be concrete in your life. Honestly, I hope you find some relief man, dont degrade yourself and most of all, find what gives you a satisfied life. Best wishes",

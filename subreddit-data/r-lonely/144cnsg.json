    "postText": "i work a 9-5 shift. most days, i do things as other people do. and in those few moments of routine, i somehow feel normal. stirring my morning coffee in complete silence, rushing to take the train to work, standing too long in the fruit aisle section of the grocery store, eating lunch alone with my co-workers although we rarely converse, looking at the night city lights while walking to the train station, smelling the barbeque grill on the avenue i pass by as they open up at 6 pm night and getting frustrated with how the smell clings onto my hair, hearing the store fronts close as they end their day, seeing the flocks of students and other people in varying faces of tiredness and happiness going home, rushing past by me. wishing i could have someone to walk home with too.\n\ni do well during the day but it always aches once i get home. after that, i go home to nothing but silence. it's kind of maddening just hearing the slow water tapping from my faulty kitchen faucet and just the whirring noise of the ceiling fan. sometimes, i'd play music on maximum volume to feel something. most times, i still can't feel anything and it ends up just being a background noise while i wash the piled up dishes. \n\nI have no one to tell. i have no one to talk to. i know how when people say they're lonely and alone, but they still have people checking up on them but that's never the case with me. all my friends (if I can still even call them that) are cities away from me and i barely know them now. i don't have any real life friends. i don't have any online friends either. i wake up to nothing but work e-mails and fall asleep to nothing but those too. i think my sadness intensifies when i experienced something wonderful during the day and i still have no one to tell. i took a photo of a pretty sunset and i have no one to share. i saw a cute cat sitting on a balcony and i have no one to share. there's just this longing. it would be nice to share things with someone. but there's no one.",

            "comment": "i mean with all the posts in r/lonely i wonder sometimes if we could all unite and start a group in each city to at least talk in person. coffee house, bar anything that helps people who come here do this but in a public face to face setting. Then i realize that i live in a small town and im 100% sure noone else in my town is on here of feeling this way. When i go out i see people i work with and they are with other people i dont know so i sit in my corner and have my drink then go home. They kinda ignore me so i do the same. Life is fucking weird lie that i guess",

A lot of the people here are local, but there is a good amount of transplants here as well, but for some reason im just the weird guy that doesnt do all the stuff they do i guess, because im not in any of those groups. lol. Its crappy, but i mean what can you do i guess.",

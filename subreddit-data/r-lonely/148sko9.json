    "postText": "I would say I\u2019m a fairly independent person, but when I\u2019m going through a hard time or depressive episode, I tend to lean on my partner a lot. In the past, I\u2019ve asked them to stay with me overnight or wfh with me. I would say this period would last 1-2 weeks, but some guys have told me that this is suffocating. I can see that, but I honestly don\u2019t require their attention or anything major, they\u2019re free to do their own thing, I just like being in their presence. \n\nDo guys who appreciate clingy gfs still exist? Or is this just too much for anyone to handle?",

I fall for someone and badly crave affection from them, usually in situations where it is unlikely they would ever go for me, and I spend so much of my time thinking about how amazing it would feel just to get a hug from her, how great would it be to cuddle with her or hold onto her for extended periods. To feel close with her. I end up obsessing over that and craving it. If she willingly gives me that, I can cool off and be a little more reasonable again, but I still can't get enough of it.\n\nA girl who wants to give me that level of attention, who puts her heart into it, helps me because then I don't have to be the weird one by needing her more than she needs me. I get to be the guy who's happy to oblige. \n\nBut there's another important factor. If I fall for you and I get into that deeply needy, obsessive mode, then we date, and then I find out you're clingy, ohhhh that is HEAVEN to me. That's every fantasy I could want.\n\nHowever, if I'm just meeting you and we go on a date and I'm still trying to figure out whether or not I'm into you. You know how sometimes, there's some attraction to someone but it's not a perfect snug-fit on-the-nose attraction, just more of a \"that'd be nice\" type. When that girl is clingy, I feel differently about it. It's flattering, and it's nice to feel wanted, but there is this underlying concern in my head. She's way more into me than I am into her. What if I don't want something serious because I'm really not sure. What if I can't get away because she won't let me? Now a few times I have taken the bait because I was in such a dry spell that it was nice to be with someone who made me feel wanted, even though I kinda knew this wasn't it. And sure enough, ending the relationship was very difficult in both those cases.\n\nSo a big part of this is how attracted am I to you? If you're my dream girl, please cling away. But if there's some doubt and you start clinging, it becomes a subconscious red flag. I wonder if this is how it works with most guys too.",

    "postText": "\nI get that all relationships are inherently reciprocal, I mean if I'm getting something out of it and giving you something in return by definition it's reciprocal, but what I don't get is the blatancy of it nowadays. It used to be people would use you in secret, in silence but today it's like everyone wants to come out and just be all \"well honestly I am hanging out with you because of all the money you spend on me, and thats why I got so close to you  and brought all my friends around you so maybe you could get more friends.\" Like who does this? I swear I can't stand humans at all... I just wanna talk to someone who isn't expecting me to lend or give them money. If I spend a month talking to another female for her to ask if I'm ever going to join her OF or keep wasting her time I might fucking lose my brain. Why do we feel the need to be so brutally honest that we forego someone else's feelings about the situation? When did we as a society become so narcissistic that we do this and pretend that it's for the other person but really it's just to make ourselves feel better about being shitty people.",

    "postText": "For all my 23 years of life, I have been lonely. It started when I was a child. My parents worked a lot and they would leave my brother and I in the house by ourselves. Now that I am an adult, this sense of loneliness is still prevalent in my life. You know ever since this year has started, I told myself to seek a romantic connection and  I have but it never lasts for me. And while I still have my heart open to making romantic connections, I have to be honest with myself and accept the fact that I am meant to be alone. It is not all bad. I have accepted it. After deeply thinking about it, I think my mission (at least right now) in life is to enjoy solitude. One thing about me is: I am hopeless romantic. I love..love and I love to see people in love. I will always smile when I see couples in-person or on instagram appearing to be so happy.",

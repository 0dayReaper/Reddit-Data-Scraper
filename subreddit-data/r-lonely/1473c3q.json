    "postText": "For as long as I remember, I had a hard time talking to people and an even harder time keeping friendship. I will confess, i had an victim mentality at one point. However I've became self aware and outcome that mindset. Middle school, I developed depression. Fortunately it was mild and it mostly affects my productivity. An 8th grade, my depression became severe as I was forced to stay home the whole year without going to an in person school. I'll go to Instagram and see a classmates having fun hanging out while I sit in my room full clutter envious. Worse, nobody talked to me during that time, not even my parents. I return to school for Freshman year, I didn't go to orientation so the campus was completely new to me. I thought that making new friends would be much easier but no, most of my middle school friends went to a different high school then me and most people in my high school I don't know. In English, I'll talk to a group if kids that often hang out. I became especially close to one person. Later on, that person start accusing me of being rude. I tried to apologize to that person and make up everything but he won't and instead started bullying me in front of the group. The worse part is that everyone is on his side. I eventually left the group and start eating lunch as I don't feel included in that group. During an AP test I became friends with a pair of sisters. Sophomore year, I've became friends with a mutual and few others creating a group. I thought that we were close and that we may hang out sometimes. The mutual throw a gathering for one of the sister birthday. The mutual invited a friend that the sister barely knows. But she didn't invite me. I was hurt but I moved on. Recently I saw that one of my friends had a birthday gathering. She didn't invite but she invited the sisters. The thing is she knows me longer, probably know me better too. Why is it happening that two of my so called \" friends\" invite people they barely know but not me? Do they not see me as a close friend? I had this mindset of either I'm gonna be a successful person with money and show everyone from my past my worth or if that work, I'll just end my life. If humans are social species, what's the point of living if no one is going socialize with me at all. Why do people act like I'm some npc with no purpose? I have interest that I'm passionate about. I'm not as boring as people think. Or I hope so. Why can't people just reach out to others. Why do I always feel like I have to one to go to?",

    "postText": "I\u2019m lesbian, I have never ever been in a relationship with a girl (or a boy for that matter) and yes I\u2019m only 16 but i\u2019ve felt this maturity for a couple of years now that I just want to be loved and understood by someone, I can have deep conversations and just be wrapped up with them for hours and I just want to experience this. Sounds cringy but I\u2019ve always been kinda lonely I don\u2019t have many friends and I\u2019ve always wanted a relationship more than a friendship with a girl because I want to feel alone but with someone for once. I tried online dating but got nowhere I currently have a friend that I met on there and I did like her but I got friend zoned and we are just friends, which I\u2019m cool with it\u2019s just not what my intentions were and now everytime I try again I feel like I\u2019m acting desperate and I just find myself now having crushes on celebrities and reading fanfiction to help with the loneliness.\n\nSorry if this sounds really strange I just can\u2019t explain or understand it for myself to be honest",

Dating scene is hell and honestly it\u2019s better to just get used to the loneliness and try to distract yourself a bit. I\u2019ve started giving up on the idea of organically meeting a girl and falling in love. Wanting to be alone with someone is also a wish I have too, hopefully we do manage to live it one day.",

If you try and force something to happen, it often doesnt work. But, take your time, find out what matters to you in a partner. And put the qualities you want in a partner down and just figure out who you wanna be. What about you is gonna attract the partner you want? When you figure those out, youll find more questions, but then youll be building a foundation for a positive relationship. Ask questions and dont blame yourself or set arbitrary dates and goals.  Just take it one step at a time and youll be amazed how far you walk when you look back at it. Good luck",

The dating pool is low enough when you're gay, but being trans it's even lower for me. Right now I'm just not looking for anyone and trying to get through each day despite how lonely and touch starved I am. I've tried apps before, but haven't had much luck. Right now it's pride month and it's supposed to be a happy time for us, but every year around this time is the loneliest for me.\n\nEventually I might start looking again, but honestly I'm starting to get comfortable being single and it's not as bad as I used to feel, though it might just be me becoming numb to it and starting to not care. I still wish I had someone special, but right now I'm just focusing on myself. It's hard but I'm trying to keep going.",

She is a little on the toxic side herself not completely awful but there are moments. Not gonna go in details since I\u2019m online and your a strange but that just about sims it up.\n\nBtw I call her mam I come from the UK so I never really call her mom just mam or mother lol",

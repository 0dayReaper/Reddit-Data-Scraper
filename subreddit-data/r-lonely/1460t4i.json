    "postText": "I took a huge step a few weeks ago and dumped my now ex-girlfriend. The writing was on the wall. She would gaslight, yell and scream, call me hurtful labels, stonewall and use a host of other manipulative and abusive behaviors to isolate me even more than I already felt. Recently, she publicly embarrassed me before a major family event, creating a huge scene over nothing important in the grand scheme. Then, she argued, yelled and screamed at me for inviting her for coffee the following day with family, after we\u2019d \u201cmade up\u201d, insinuating that \u201cI don\u2019t really want [you] there.\u201d She wanted me to beg her to come and I refused. Despite our arguing, the only person my family could hear was her screaming at me, ridiculing me, telling me to \u201cfuck myself\u201d and to \u201cstop, stop, stop!\u201d, whenever I expressed just disagreement to her. Ultimately, we never even got that coffee and had to catch a train. I hadn\u2019t seen my family in eight months, the last being for two funerals one day after another. That was my opportunity, despite recent unemployment and other stressors, to see and bond with them\u2014while I was introducing her\u2014and I squandered that chance by entertaining her argument.\n\nBarely a couple months into the relationship, she started doing things like this. We\u2019d argue for literally hours, in a small apartment with roommates. She was the type to make a public scene on the street. She\u2019d do everything from yell, scream and ridicule to bawl and cry, always shifting the topic of argument. She tried to get me to switch my career path, compromise on what I value and completely isolate myself from even platonic relationships with women in my life other than family because she always feared I was \u201cloose\u201d and would cheat, despite admitting to her in confidence that I\u2019d been hurt by my ex-wife, who cheated before my eyes while we were in couples\u2019 therapy together. \n\nThe day I broke up with her, my therapist said to me in no uncertain terms that though it\u2019s rare for a mental health professional to give active advice unless the situation were dire, he urged that I leave the relationship as soon as possible. He, like my mother and family that met her, said the same thing, \u201cthis is toxic.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m omitting a lot from here on, but the day I broke up with her, a million thoughts raced through my head:\n\n\u201cWhat if this is a huge mistake?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I can\u2019t make it myself?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere am I gonna live and what am gonna do?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this what I really need to do? Have I exhausted every other option before this?\u201d\n\nThen I thought of my mother. She endured abuse for her decades-long marriage to my father, who was an alcoholic. I remember constantly fighting and yelling and clawing and toothing my way through arguments with my dad, who routinely looked for ways to abuse, control and dominate her. I was always the only one who spoke up for her or myself, and I thought then about why she was in this situation in the first place. Why anyone with half a brain would endure something like this voluntarily. Then I remembered, she had no choice. She was born in a different part of the world in a different time with a lack of higher education. With a few kids and a low-paying job, how could she consider leaving?\n\nBut then I thought about myself. I remembered that I don\u2019t have to allow this to happen to me. I am educated. I have upward mobility. I may have lost a position, but I can find another. I don\u2019t have to put up with this. She only controls me if I give her the power to.\n\nWhen I was breaking up with her, I witnessed the weirdest transformation I\u2019ve ever seen from a partner\u2014she suddenly was polite, understanding, soft-spoken and even kind. She implored me to continue our relationship, begging for a couple days to make it work, for her to \u201cshow me\u201d that she took the change seriously. She said that I was her soulmate, that I\u2019m the only person she\u2019d ever consider marrying, that we\u2019re meant to be together. She admitted to taking out her anger and frustrations on me because I was an \u201ceasy target\u201d. She said that she was conscious of how she was acting and insisted that she\u2019d stop. We\u2019d get a therapist. She even went on to force intimacy and straddled me to force me to look very closely at her, before I shrugged her off. She called her technique of arguing with me and gaslighting me for hours \u201cpassion\u201d in an argument that apparently she got from her family, to which I responded that that\u2019s pathological. \n\nFinally, when she realized that I wasn\u2019t going to be persuaded, she did a 180 and said coldly that she thinks it\u2019s the right thing to do, that she thought I was waiting for her to do it to \u201crip off the bandaid\u201d, that she even agreed with me and that it was for the best. I left the apartment to give her time to pack some of her things and leave. \n\nI just feel so many emotions right now. On the one hand, I am relieved. On the other, in some weird way, I miss having her around to an extent. I\u2019ve always had a fear of being alone. I\u2019m confused because I know I shouldn\u2019t miss this at all, and I have so much to contend with at the moment. I want to start doing things for myself again, because when I do, things really seem to work. My whole life, I\u2019ve always felt lonely. As a kid, my family moved from an area with a lot of emotional support and extended family to the middle of nowhere. I remember the closest family for hours coming by and being awful company, yet I\u2019d cry when they left because I didn\u2019t have anyone else. My siblings were much older, my parents had their own problems and I didn\u2019t have friends.",

            "comment": "Congratulations for breaking away from an abusive relationship and speaking out about it, very brave on both counts! It\u2019s natural to feel the way that you do. Take time to process your feelings and what you\u2019ve learned. Recognise the flags you\u2019ve identified so that this hopefully won\u2019t happen again, and use them to get out early if you can.\n\nIn terms of loneliness all I can suggest is to get out there and do physical and mentally healthy things for yourself. Hopefully those activities will maintain the positive direction you\u2019re going in and give you the opportunity to experience both new things and people. Your future is far brighter now than it was before, focus on that. Wish you the very best of luck!",

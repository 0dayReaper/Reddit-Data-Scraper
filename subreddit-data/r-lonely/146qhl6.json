    "postText": "I'm wasting my summer and it sucks so much. This was my first year in an in person Highschool and I was excited since I really wanted to hang out with people and make friends but, of course that didn't happen.\n\nI'm pretty much confined to my room 100% of the summer unless I get a job; which I probably won't be able to do for another month since I'm only 15 and places don't hire to 16 usually.\n\nI honestly want to die so badly; being completely alone in my room is fucking with me mentally. Most my peers are out in the city having fun while I'm stuck in my room.\n\nIt's not even like I could just go out either considering the main city people hang around is 30-40mins away by car so I can't go anywhere at all.\n\nIt's going to be an awful 70 days; when school does start again I'll probably want to die again because of how lonley and uncomfortable I am around others but, it's still better than spending every waking moment looking at the same 4 walls of my room being not only mentally alone but, physically as well.",

Second closes place would be a hike but, I'm not allowed to go alone since it's really secluded and my parents think I'd get murdered + I'm not really into hiking I mainly just want to be able to walk around either a city or some malls with people since; being by myself doing those things isn't much fun.",

    "postText": "Hello. I\u2019m 26. Recently my bf and I had a huge argument. I had recently made a mistake and my bf was rightly mad and I understood why they were mad. I\u2019ve apologized and have been working hard to help heal the damage that I have done but every few weeks they bring up the past and there is nothing I can say. I love my partner with everything I have. They are the only person I\u2019ve wanted to have a life with but I don\u2019t know if that will be possible now. I want to say that I will be strong and grow back from this but to be honest, if I don\u2019t hide from society I will probably kill myself. He is the only reason I\u2019ve stayed alive but idk what to do anymore.",

    "postText": "I (35M) am turning 36 tomorrow. I\u2019ve never been Mr. popular but I\u2019ve had friends. The past several years have been rough. All my friends have drifted away. I\u2019ve tried to maintain the friendships but it just isn\u2019t there. I don\u2019t have anyone. I sit here wondering if I will even get a \u201chappy birthday\u201d from anyone tomorrow. I was watching tv the other day and a story came on on how loneliness is an epidemic right now. I can relate. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m just venting.",

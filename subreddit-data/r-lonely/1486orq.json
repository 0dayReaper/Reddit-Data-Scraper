    "postText": "i had to put my 16 year old cat down yesterday after staying up all night with him, holding him as he has 13 seizures. and i think it might very been my breaking point. since i was 8 yrs old ive had to deal with so many people that are close to me die. my Papa (my best friend) died when I was 8 yrs old and since then, death has followed me. but the last 3 years have been literal hell. \n\nMarch 2020, my Mother died after there was neglect from the hospital on top of a heart condition caused by a diet pill. my birth was how she found out her heart valve was dying from the diet pill she was taking. Since my birth in 1999, up until 2020, my entire family's purpose was my mother's heart condition. She was in and out of hospitals all the time. I had the \"death talk\" in ER waiting rooms as a child, holding my baby sister many times. She flatlined so many times, had strokes, neuropathy in her legs, etc. We fought so fucking hard to keep her alive. But the hospital fucked up and basically killed her..\n\nafter she died early March 2020, death and sickness followed me like a plague. My dog died, both my rabbits died, my dad was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer, my great aunt with stage 2 cancer, my grandma died, and again, just yesterday I had to put my childhood cat down.\n\nwhen my dad told my sister and I about his cancer, my sister was already about to move out of state for college. so I stayed home to be a full time care giver for him. it was bad. there were many complications and extra scares and hospital visits. I became a 24/7 nurse for my dad, and the same year he moved his elderly sick parents in. so for almost 3 years, I was a full time care taker for my sick dad, his 80 year old hoarder dad, and his 80 year old stubborn mother. btw, my grandparents were divorced and basically hated each other. all three of them are diabetic and refuse to take care of themselves. a couple months ago my grandma's poor habits caught up with her and she passed suddenly. \n\nI live in my childhood home with my fiancee, dad and grandpa. and I honestly just want to die. I'm so tired of being strong and enduring so much. not only death, but trauma and abuse for most of my life. I'm autistic and mentally ill. and honestly, I don't know who I am. I've been in therapy for years, been on meds for years, etc. but nothing helps.. I just feel hollow inside.\n\nI've heard the \"everyone dies that's just life, you have to move on and live for them\" talk since before I learned my fucking ABCs. I'm so tired. I want to tattoo myself and get a shop but I'm fucking broke and I can't hold down a job because of my mental illnesses. I don't feel like a human. I feel like im just a robot meant to take care of others.\n\nif I had like 3 to 5 hundred bucks I could get my tattoo equipment and start my journey. but I honestly just want to give up because no one but my fiancee believes in me. I don't even have friends anymore because I stopped reaching out first. the urges are getting so bad, but I haven't told anyone. \n\ni just wanna be with my mom again. ive been stoned out of my mind for the last 3 years because i have countless traumatic experiences floating around in my head. and EVERY time I feel like im getting better, someone else fucking dies. i can't take it anymore. i even gave up on having kids because i can't fucking handle even the possibility of losing my child. i can't do it anymore. i want to be alone..but i also just want to be held by my mom again.\n\nidk what i wanted out of this. i guess just to talk since i have no one else. don't feel pressured to comment or anything. if you read this, thank you. you took more time reading this than anyone in my family has for me. i hope you have a better day than i did.",

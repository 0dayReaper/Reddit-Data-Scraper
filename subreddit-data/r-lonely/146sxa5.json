    "postText": "So my ex and I broke up a year ago. Towards the end  she was not the best person. Manipulative and emotionally abusive. Unfortunately I haven't had any luck meeting someone else. I've had a few dates that were ok but didn't lead to anything. We still keep in touch and she texted me asking if I was free for a drink and if she could spend the night. I know it's weak but I'm really tempted. Its not just the sex. It would be really nice to have another person in my bed to sleep with. My friends would say I'm an idiot and they are probably right but they don't really understand what it's like to be lonely. I'd love to hear other people's thoughts",

I guess what I'm saying is part of me would like to feel some intimacy again but I also kind of don't want to give her the satisfaction. Also my friends would be probably mad at me",

Who may be the only person she can trust not to do to her what she did to you...\n\nI mean, it's only one night, you said so yourself. Tbh, she's prolly had sorrier luck on the scene than you, my dude. Do her a solid, break her off- shake hands in the morning like the civilized species that we portray ourselves to be, and smile at a favor well savored. \nEasy-peasy!",

If you think you can come out tomorrow morning feeling better then go for it, power to you. If you can't, then *that's* the bit you need to consider.",

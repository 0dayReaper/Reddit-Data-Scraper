    "postText": "Set a goal this month to interact with more strangers in hopes of finally making friends, and since I have no social life nor any connections the only place I can do this at is at the gym. Most of these interactions don't go any further than a small 3 minute chat and it's always about the same boring gym stuff.\n\nLast week I met this great individual and I felt like we hit it off quite well and we talked for a bit. However, since I am too much of a loser I ended up leaving without asking for their contact. I have not seen that person since resulting in me feeling lonelier and more depressed than ever knowing damn well that I might not ever see that person again.\n\nI get so overly attached to every single person who acknowledges my existence.. The only thing I've been able to think about is this person, and it's killing me. I've not been able to sleep at all this week, constantly being reminded of  how great it would be to have a person to hang out with.\n\nI'm so fucking pathethic.",

I'd just try to focus on your gym routine and keep an eye out for this individual, maybe luck will have it that you see them again, or not. Not much you can do in that case. \n\nI know it's difficult to make the next step, like asking for the number. I would try to segment the whole process. Instead of thinking what if I am refused, laughed at, mocked etc. is counterproductive. Try to push that out of your mind and just focus on the next step, just asking the number, you can deal with the \"consequences\" later, be they good or bad.",

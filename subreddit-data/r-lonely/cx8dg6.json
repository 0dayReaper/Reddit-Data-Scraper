It can be more harmful than good, because the person having the difficult time is having those difficulties for a reason, and the one who says that is basically just saying \u201cI find what you\u2019re sad about to be a stupid/foolish/asinine reason.\u201d And that thought, whether it\u2019s actually meant or just implied by the sufferer, has the potential to lead to so many more problems, some maybe even life\u2013altering or life\u2013ending if that person is depressed enough. This is why I agree with your main post; I see how it\u2019s saying we should be there for our fellow person, even if we don\u2019t know them. Maybe we don\u2019t buy them ice cream, but if we did, there\u2019s a possibility just this action alone could help boost their spirits\u2026especially because its ice cream. No one I know can ever be in a bad/sad/angry mood once the ice cream comes around.",

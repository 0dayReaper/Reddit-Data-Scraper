But idk what's wrong with me, it would've been better if she told me what's the problem, I wanted to ask her but I don't know if she wants to talk, so I guess we'll never find out. \n\nanyway, let's see how long I can goooooo and thanks for listening to my rant.",

Most people think love is just supposed to fall on your lap. There's someone inside the walls waiting for you to sigh loud enough, then they'll koolaid man their way into your life. It doesn't work like that. Not for everyone. And some call the cops.\n\nThere's billions of people on the planet. I've tried like 9. I gave up at 9 and said I'll just be alone forever. Out of a billion? That's insane. Don't say \"at least you had someone\". Grass is greener. I'll trade all of my failures for your fresh perspective right now. I'm jaded. Lied to, cheated on, abused physically, mentally, emotionally. I'd throw it at ya if I could. \n\nPoint is, there's no way any of us has been exposed to enough people to say \"no one\". At most, we've been damaged and rejected by whatever is closest to us and thrown in the towel. I don't expect everyone to blind date abroad. Just realize the numbers at play. It's statistically impossible that out of so many people, absolutely none would choose you, or is right for you. Finding them is the real enemy. I gave up on looking.",

So many relationships end because people have unresolved person shit that influences their behavior with their partner or they take it out on them. \n\nI really don\u2019t care what anyone says, when you get ahead of problems with a professional present instead of hurting eachother through miscommunications and toxic tendencies, you can last forever. \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m still in love with my ex who is toxic while trying not to sleep with my boss who is pursuing me and I have feelings for and is married so\u2026what do I know!",

Will you ever meet one? Perhaps. Perhaps not. And if you do meet, is the timing right? You might even meet one, date, and  after a period circumstances intervene and it ends. Anyway, there are many such people across the world for almost everyone. One may be 6 miles away and you never, ever meet. Another might be in Paris while you\u2019re in a small town in Chile and by freak occurrence you meet and fall in love. But who can plan any of that? \n\nThe real question: is there a true *soul mate* for everyone?",

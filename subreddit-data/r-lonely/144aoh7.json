    "postText": "I don't have friends, I'm always alone doing my own things and I feel solace without people around me. I find people are too dependent on their friends and once they are gone, they will just be lonely as I am and shows how completely vulnearable they are. or whenever they have breakups they turn on people like people give a shit about their relationship, people keep mentioning this whenever they broke up its annoying. I don't feel bad about them, I just don't care and don't have time for their shit they should keep it to themselves.  \n\n\nI'm already in terms that I'm meant to be alone and I will continue pushing people away because I don't want any attachment and be used. I only exist to them if they need me.  \n\n\n I can feel loneliness and hits hard but I know that It will past away eventually and I just keep distracting myself. I suffer from depression which amplifies this.",

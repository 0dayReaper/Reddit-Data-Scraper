And this leads to me feeling angry. People always harp on about how important friends and family are, I\u2019m sick of hearing it!! I\u2019m missing out on one of the most important aspects of life! I\u2019m just merely existing at this point\u2026",

It's boring just working 6 days a week  try to be nice friend and get treated like dirt, come home exhausted, cook, eat and sleep Repeat. Just want to be loved and feel it.",

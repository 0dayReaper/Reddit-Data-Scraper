    "postText": "I got nobody for prom, everyone is out making plans what to do before and after but i'm finding ways to get sick so i have a good excuse not to go. I don't want to get embarassed at the dance standing alone and doing nothing. People go to prom to celebrate and have fun, to take pictures of beautiful moments, they don't just stand around doing nothing. God i fucking hate myself for being like this, i tought things would get diffrend after i really tried to get social with people around me but nothing changed. I feel like escaping from everything and never coming back. I don't know what to do, i have been lonely for a long time and it has affected me in many ways, seeing everyone around you have fun while you wish to run away is so depressing. I feel like shit writing this but i had to get it off my chest, not like i have anybody else to vent to. If you read this and have been in a somewhat similar situation just know you are not alone.",

I was actually not even planning on going to prom.\n\nBut I went anyways.\n\nAnd I unexpectedly had a good time. I found some loners to hang with. And we didn't really dance or do any of that shit most people do at prom. \n\nI only took one picture the entire night. It wasn't even a good one. It was just to prove our interaction happened.\n\nThe whole time I was there, I did think about some of the others, sitting in the chairs, too uncomfortable to get up, or too lonely to have fun.\n\nThe worst feeling of Loneliness coming from being excluded.\n\nSeeing others have fun\nWithout you.\n\nSo what would I do in your situation?\n\nProm is what you make it. It doesn't have to be the polished, best night of your high school life like the movies. It's really not.\n\nFuck Hollywood.\n\nFind your own fun. Do something you want to do instead that will make everyone else jealous, because you're worth it \u2728\ufe0f",

Turned out not so much. \n\n\nEveryone had plans to go to some kind of party but I was never invited to any. I'm talking TONS of stuff was going on after prom, but nobody had a space for me. I never came to anyone's mind when deciding who to invite. My literal closest circle of friends, the ones I spent all my time with, got a limo to ride to prom together. I wasn't invited but a dude who didn't even hardly hang out with us was, in the spot that I easily could have taken . I was literally the ONLY one from our group excluded. And I was friend zoned hard by my date who I was convinced I was in love with. I think that was when I kind of broke, and it's been a shitty downward progression ever since. So sorry to hear someone else is having an awful experience thanks to prom. Fuck prom.",

I often regretted not having the high school experience that would have let me enjoy the prom, but I never regretted not going. If it's going to make you feel worse, skip it. It isn't all that important in the grand scheme of things. (Also, stay away from social media where other people talk about it...don't feel worse for seeing how much fun they had.)",

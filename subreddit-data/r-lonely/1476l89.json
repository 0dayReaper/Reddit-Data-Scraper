I can\u2019t imagine how hard life is doing for everyone here, but you know, everybody is special and you should be proud of yourself. I am in that case, ik, but since I found myself a job, it stopped. I was really depressed about being lonely, those girls outside are kinda rude with me, but idc anymore! I work with all my soul and I think that it is because I can help some people by doing my job. And yeah, sometimes I feel a little bit depressed, so I turn on my Xbox, play for 2-3hrs and I go back to bed. \n\nFor me, lately, I\u2019ve been talking to a girl that I find really cute, feeling was good, I was happy talking to her. But now, I heard that she has a bf, and now she answers very late, between 2-7hrs. And found myself playing on my Xbox every night. I don\u2019t feel too good. Rn I am happy only because Ferrari won the 24hrs of LeMans so\u2026 I know I feel bad for a stupid reason, just like a child, but guys, I want someone to spend my days and nights with, I want to be loved, but idk if I really deserve too, it\u2019s maybe the reason why Everytime I tried, It ended badly",

    "postText": "After about 3 years of therapy with two different psychologists, I feel like I have the tools to recognize my triggers, spirals, and how to dig myself out of my lonely depression. The problem is, I don\u2019t believe any of the tools I use. I\u2019m at a point in my life where I feel confident I have completely wasted my twenties. So much deep dark insecurities have kept me away from people or have pushed people away. If you hate yourself and all you can think about is how much you hate yourself, then you might not be the most enjoyable person to be around, right? But at the same time I know if my personality was better and if I were handsome, then people would want to be around me. Instead, I\u2019m going into my thirties alone, repeating the same cycles I have been for year after year. I feel pretty hopeless. The friends I do have all have their partners to prioritize, which I get. That only makes me miserably jealous for what they have. I think I\u2019m a miserable person, and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll never not be alone and miserable.",

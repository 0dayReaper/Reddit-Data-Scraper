    "postText": "I feel so disconnected from my generation. I dont like to drink, smoke, go to shisha bars or parties/festivals/discos... And I struggle with keeping up hobbies and interests. Most of the days I just want to stay in bed and cry. Especially when I drive home from work during summer time when I see lots of young people hanging out together and which I never really had. Only ever had some weird friendships which I fcked up bc I dont have a lot of social expierience.",

Theres so much stuff id be excited to do with friends, but when I think about doing it by myself I get depressed... Sometimes I hope that i could pay someone to spend time with me and if it works out to meet privately as well without paying anything... But otherwise im not sure if its a redflag for someone to demand money for meeting with someone",

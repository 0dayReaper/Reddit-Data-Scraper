    "postText": "I've been struggling with relationships of any kind ever since I was little. When I was little people thought I was annoying and I talked to much so I stopped talking almost completely and was scared of judgement to the point I'd shake in fear if I tried to socialize. Long story short I tried so many times to create friendships and relationships and keep them. I've always believed that people will ALWAYS be there for you no matter what because that's what shows I'd watch taught me. Had to learn the hard way that was just bull. Most friendships I ruined or they faded way with no reason. It's the same story over and over. I decided to just accept it at this point and just try to distract myself with things I enjoy to forget about it. Sad that that's reality but what you gonna do?",

That wasn't your fault, there used to be a point when things were different.\n\nThen you mention people you expected to stay but they didn't. You would've stayed though, so again it's not your fault.\n\nAll this points to is that you're capable of overcoming loneliness, you've got the tools in you. It's only a matter of circumstance that's not happening.\n\nSo to me it looks like you're not accepting loneliness, it's more of a shout at injustice of the fact that you're lonely.",

Atleast that way you will be happy with yourself, and sure you do wish that someone loves you.. that's life in this age we live in right now.. be the better person and love yourself, choose to be happy and love yourself. Do what you want to do with your life. Life isn't just about loving and being loved. And also that starts with you! It's all perspective. Anytime you're down get back up eventually",

U are still at an age where nothings for sure yet. Ur still changing. 17 year old me wouldn\u2019t recognize 20 year old me and my social life has changed a lot since then. And I\u2019m still changing. Don\u2019t give up yet. You\u2019ve still got a lot of potential",

Starting with the fear that holds you, as someone twice your age, I cannot and will not seek to tell you where the good direction lies. Kicking around in the darkness has been invaluable to me in that regard because you have to really face what it is that you want in your life and how you plan on achieving that goal. Do you live for your sake or do you want to live for the sake of others? Can you challenge yourself to risk being open about what it is you want and what you have to offer? Is your life wasted if your personal goals are not achieved or if you fail to get others to smile because of you? \n\nLuckily as a lonely person, you're likely more introspective than the average bear, and challenging yourself to find meaning in your suffering is likely going to prove to be an easier task for you than it is for others. Your avoidance of pain and fears will help guide you to how to make your pain useful and your suffering to have meaning. \n\nI can't say \"don't worry about life, it'll sort itself out\" but i can say \"there are those out there who will truly understand the world in the same way you do, you just need the courage to admit how you really feel.\" That's my advice, to find your echo chamber that resonates with your soul and to devote yourself to it. If that means you exist for your own desires, that's great. If it means that your existence is that of making others happy, that's great too. Seek to find which side of the spectrum suits you.",

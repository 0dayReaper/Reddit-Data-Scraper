    "postText": "I take my clothes to the laundromat. I go early in the morning, when no one is there.\n\nI get there this morning, and there was an older man there washing his clothes. He initiated a conversation with me, and we talked for 2 hours. \n\nWe talked about everything. His service in the marines, his tour in Vietnam, his wife who died, etc. I talked about my history, family, job and how I\u2019m getting my life back on track. \n\nHe gave me some amazing life advice. He told me that my mother should be proud of me, and that he was \u201cHappy that he came to wash his clothes\u201d \n\nAs we were both leaving, I helped him load his clothes into his car, since he was older and frail. He then turns to me, shakes my hand and says \u201cThank you. Good luck with everything. May god bless you.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not really a religious person, but him telling me \u201cMay god bless you\u201d, really made me cry. It felt like someone actually cared about my well-being. He genuinely cared. He took the time to listen to me, and in turn, felt vulnerable enough to share his own trials and tribulations. I didn\u2019t grow up with a strong father figure, so hearing an older gentleman say \u201cYou have a good head on your shoulders\u201d really meant the world to me. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy how a small interaction with a total stranger, can mean so much. It felt great to have someone care the way he did",

It's not about _being_ worthy or not, there isn't some benevolent ruler judging who's worthy of friends and giving them people as a present, it's about others being free whatever they want, but also getting a society out of those feelings\n\nFeeling unworthy is simply a thing that pushes people to gain that \"worth\", to somehow change themselves to suit other people and be a part of a society. But the ways we do that and the ways we view ourselves in relation to society may not be correct if we grew up in conditions that aren't representative of the society we live in\n\nUs feeling \"bad\" isn't some mistake or a cruel joke, it's what creates the society",

People like THAT need to be kept in check cause they are the 'takers who keep on taking but never give' and they exploit the 'Givers'  of society for every drop of their blood.  \n\nWe The People Must be walk keeps these psychos in check\n\nSecond thing I have to say is that there are manyways in which society deems someone 'worthy' that i feel you are not aware of. \n\nWhen someone commits a crime, we examine the evidence, deliberate carefully and determine of this person is 'worthy' of freedom, worthy of being near kids ever again, worthy of us struppibg them of most oftheir rights, worthy of etc... When you lay down on a operating table how do you know that person who is about to cut into you actially has worthiness to be doing such a dangerous thing? Well typially surgeons and dentists will post their degrees onto the walls of their office  as a show off to everyone that: ' ya I busted my ass for '4-to-however long' years just to make sure I can do this cause this is my passion', but there are other people like watchdog organizations the keeps track of the conduct and malpractices of any 'professional' and a lot of these organizations are worthy o being listened to clearly. Even when you go home to meet your S/O both of you are unconciously determining how worthy they think you are and how worthy you think they are , I mean why do you go home wvery time to your S/O rather than just frolick over to any person who you think is attactive and interesting? Clearly  if your S/O has been by your side through thicc and thin for thee past  25 years, they are far more worthy of your love and time than someone who is younger, cuter (to you), and way more interesting that you just met 25 minutes ago, would you not agree? I think most people would agree with me on that.  \n\nIt is NOT one benevolent ruler determining worthiness it is We The People, The Workers, Those Who The Economies Depend On, The Comman Person of Any Gender Man, Woman, Non-Binary , Whoever . It is **WE** come together to determine who is worth our  time and effort and keep in check those who  veiw themselves in relatiion to society in unhealthy ways  and act out in ubhealthg ways that harm other people. \n\nWe need less singled rulers who determine everything for everyone and more power to the common people more power to the mothers and fathers who are raising our future. More power to the workers who go off into the mines, into the woods, into the most dangerous, and darkest parts of the society and the planet and do the work there to act as a shining light , a shining example that shows others what considerate, and gainful employment means . We need a society that is run more so together by ALL of us not a greedy, maniacal few. We have to ve able to keep those greedy few in check so that they cannot cause too much harm. Even now in the Global South the people there are feeling the effects of global warming FAR more harshly than any of us here are  or will for a long time and most of these pollutants originate from a few massive companies not even from The Common People. Do you think we should not keep said companies in check after hearing the tearful stories of thoe effected by such ignorance? \n\nThis is why I advocate harshly for socialism and anarchism. We have seen the type of destruction of what entrusting a powerful few causes and no I dont only mean wars and enforced famines I talk of the Loneliness Crisis we face today. Clearly we are facing a significant crisis in loneliness as many more people than before have reported feeling lonely and we watch as our walkable streets, publicly beneficial services, and our desire and abiliy to 'reach out' erode.",

And what a gift you gave by being recognizing and being open to another member of your human family.\n\nSo many people just plant their face on their screens and pretend they are looking at something riveting. \n\nPeople do care about other people and want to care about other people.

    "postText": "Just walk into any random bar on a weekday night and you'll see a dozen men sitting by their lonesome. They'll stay there till curtain call, just holding onto the one drink they have in their hand, while looking through their phone in the other hand. Hanging onto the absolute last shred of hope, until the absolute last minute, hoping that they'll meet someone. Then the bartender says it's closing time, so they'll finish their drink, leave a tip, then return to their nothingness.\n\nThe internet really isn't that different. Just look around reddit, this place is filled with nothing but lonely men. Young men, old men. Divorced men, virgin men.\n\nWe're all forever alone in here, the irony.",

But i have found meaning in my life that doesn't let me kill myself i still hate myself the most and countinue to till eternity, and honestly i too don't have anyone in life and even though i know i need someone it's not going to happen so i have just stopped wasting my time emotions and  feelings and energy in all these things life is pretty short and so much other things are there to enjoy and experience and do, just find meaning and live it may it be play video games, watch movies or whatever it maybe just revolving around people dosent go well. My personal reasons is just no matter what i do iam never happy so i just i try to help others in need and spread happiness at least let other have it to make a better world and gives me a feeling i did something and my life is not waste iam spreading happiness and making a positive difference in humanity so i have to help as much people as much as i can which is almost endless so it keeps me from killing myself i have to fullfill my part before i go",

Maybe our country (Philippines) is just different. Here there are more women who grow old single and stay a virgin. Most men get married or at least have a partner or a child in his 20s or 30s. The only older guys I know who are old and not married are mostly gays (there's no same-sex marriage here). Even ugly, drug addicts with no jobs can get girlfriends here. They even have the guts to cheat.\n\nMost guys here on Reddit say women have more choices, but here we see it differently. Men have more freedom in dating because they are the ones courting. If you're a woman here and no one courts you, then you'll probably end up single forever. Of course, Tinder made a bit of difference and gave more women a chance but mostly it's just for hookups not relationships.\n\nI have four sisters (mid 20s to early 30s) and only one is married. The rest of us are probably going to stay old single ladies. My 3 single sisters haven't even had a bf ever. I had a relationship before but I've been single for almost 4 years now.",

Mostly, it's just gay men who stay single in old age because we don't have same sex marriage and many of them are still closeted too.\n\nYou're right about the conservative part though. Most women still don't want the hook up culture, though younger generations are being more liberal.\n\nI'm not saying courting is just THE reason but it is one of the top reasons. If you are not considered pretty here, the chance of being courted is not that high and since there are a few women who use dating apps, those who don't usually won't get a date at all. Since I deleted my dating apps 4 years ago, I've never gotten a single date offer again IRL.\n\nIt's not true that no matter how you look, men would flock to you. Men here are more picky and are very judgemental when it comes to looks. Also, they are not desperate to get women because it's actually not that hard. You can get a girlfriend even if you don't have money and you're ugly. Of course, having more money is an advantage but even men from the slums have multiple girlfriends.\n\nAnother factor is a woman's status in life. It seems that when you are more educated and career oriented the chance of being courted is lower. I guess some men are intimated to have a girl who is earning more than them. There's still a mindset here that men should be the providers.",

Just as men don't understand what it's like to only be seen as an object, women don't understand what it's like to *not be seen at all*. And I'd argue the latter is a worse situation to be in, but problems are problems. For men, they want to be seen for once, in any capacity. For women, they've had their fill and just want some peace and quiet for once.\n\nHowever, I also think women get into the mindset that all men *only* want sex. As if a man wanting sex and a man wanting a relationship are mutually exclusive things, as if a man who is willing to display his sexuality can't also want something more serious. Like, yeah, of course we want sex. Everyone wants sex. That's what separates romantic relationships from platonic friendships. But that says nothing about whether or not a guy also wants a relationship. They're completely unrelated.",

I would never hurt the man I love because when I say \u201cI do\u201d at the alter, that means I\u2019m dying with him and doing anything and everything to better our lives and keep us afloat.

But to generalize and negate the struggles of the average woman compared to average man is pretty hurtful to everyone.

Sure, I've reaped the benefits as a guy who's spent lots of money on escorts that I likely wouldn't have been able to find without Twitter and the advent of the \"review board\" but honestly, maybe that's not a good thing. I can't help but think if I lived 100 years ago, I would've had \"no choice\" but to improve my life, especially when I was much younger, to the point where I am desirable. But I haven't had enough challenges to face that have forced that to happen, and now it's much too late to try to do an about-face. So I suffer, as do many others here.",

This belief crushes you and makes you hopeless and doesn't even give you a fair chance.\n\nHow is that not a bad mindset to have? \n\nIt is more than possible for you to get what you want, \nyou aren't missing anything that you think is required.\n\nThis is the reality that I want you to live in.\n\nYes, you probably won't be sleeping with super models every night and you might not ever own 15 yachts, but you don't need to,  that isn't a healthy goal to set any way.\n\nWhat do you desire that you think you can't achieve?\nAnswer me this please.\n\nSo yes, I think it's a bad mindset that will only lead you towards self destructive thoughts and behaviors that will turn you into an incell. I don't want that for you.\n\nI wanna hear your thoughts on this, whether you agree or disagree.\nI'd like this to be a friendly discussion but you can be angry too if you want. Either way I'm curious to hear back from you.\n\nIt is better to be optimistic and wrong, than to be pessimistic and correct - Elon Musk.",

You can try and try and try, change this and change that, become a new person essentially and still not exist to women.  Nothing to do with women want alpha this and that, just that some men are just not desirable\u2026 at all to women.  Yea there are billions of people, that still doesn\u2019t mean anything because you can surely still not come across that one that actually accepts you for you.  \n\nYes the mindset is bad, but when you see people who don\u2019t have this mindset and still alone, still no attention from women, still pretty much never acknowledged and or noticed\u2026 you see no point in changing the mindset as the opposite has no guarantees of yielding better results.  \n\nAlso like you said, once you\u2019ve had the mindset for so long, it\u2019s becomes very hard to let it go, especially with nothing to support why you should let it go",

There's no such thing as real alpha and beta wolves out in the wild, and the same can be said of humans - any guy who calls himself an \"alpha male\" is using bullshit buzzwords to give himself a false sense of superiority. Some guys might have it easier than others because of their looks and social skills when it comes to meeting and dating people, but it's not because of some stupid intrinsic value of male human hierarchy.",

Nobody is going to interrupt someone while they're clearly busy on their phone.  If you're lonely and you're trying to meet someone at a bar then it would be a great idea to put the phone away and talk to people.  Talk to people you're not interested in too especially if you're socially anxious or uncomfortable.\n\nIf you just sit there and make zero effort to talk with anyone chances are you'll stay lonely.  At least make an effort to talk to one of the other lonely guys.  Maybe you can make a friend.  If you're lonely your intention should be to make a friend anyway.  Women are not attracted to lonely and/or weak men that don't have any  friends.\n\nThere's a dozen lonely guys at the bar on their phones and none of them are talking to each other.  That's why they're lonely.  If I was a woman I definitely would not be approaching a guy that was sitting by himself on his phone.  \n\nHaving the mentality that you'll be forever alone is a self-fulfilling prophecy.  It's why so many people in this sub won't even try to make friends with the other people in this sub.",

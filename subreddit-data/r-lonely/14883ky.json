One would think that men who are not happy with the way things are going in their lives would like Jordan Peterson the way I do. Even if people disagree with him about transgenders, why can't they just acknowledge he has some good points?\n\nSecond edit: seeing how people are triggered by the mere mention of Jordan Peterson, and reading that the reason he is so triggering is because of TrAnsPhObia, I can only say one thing.

What I would like to know is why my comment was downvoted as much as it was, if you are one of the ones who downvoted it. I think he is relevant to this conversation since not only does he talk about problems making men lonely like the inverse pay gap and the COVID lockdown. He also mentions online dating as a cause and most importantly, he talks about precisely what the OP complained of. He talks about how people need more than just sex, and how sexualization of everything hurts both men and women. I myself am lonely, and like OP, what I want is more than just sex.",

I don't have the energy, the money or the intelligence to do anything about it. I lost the intellect from being prescribed antipsychotics I didn't need as my psychiatrist exaggerated what I shared with her omitting a lot of what I said aside from the worst, you know the conflict one usually has when depression lifts, the people who would give me peace associating with me again don't care about me due to how badly I melted down due to stressful life events and I chose the wrong course instead of just sitting and accepting the burning house my life was becoming, I had lost my job, my family had health issues and took it out on me, and later on someone I thought had infinite patience decided then would be a good time to tell me they had a problem with me and wanted something a certain way or they'd be leaving.\n\nI've tried to force it with drug cocktails mixed with alcohol, wrist cutting, starvation and more. I have even contacted centers that can arrange euthanasia and contacted local representatives asking for them to help get the ball rolling on allowing euthanasia so I can finally be released from this hell I call my life. I sought help and was burned with losing the one thing I liked about myself, my intellect and didn't get any help with sorting out my emotional state more aside from how within a week Strattera was working but I wasn't given a therapist to help me deal with anything I was left to my own devices and the intrusive thoughts I had been secretly dealing with when shared because I felt better I was given something I didn't need when Strattera was working just fine on helping me get my emotional state to be more positive and giving me motivation that depression had conditioned me to expect I would run out of and start struggling again to get anything done with enjoyment instead of just going through the motions, aside from the occasional burst of energy.\n\nI also felt depressed because I felt like getting through an a+ certification and being successful would only attract a partner that would only choose me or tolerate me for money and leave when they deemed it was convenient and could walk away with money. I wanted to find someone in the same field or level as me, it took me awhile to see past the crush I had asking if I had life insurance, in retrospect I should have allowed myself to speak up and ask \"would you only be interested in collecting life insurance off of me if I was with you?\". I fear being taken advantage of because the amount of times people just take and take have been numerous, some even when I can't deliver have left, threatened me, or just distanced themselves.\nI even had that with the past group who expected that despite no longer being friends demanded I provided tech support for free, when I made it clear that for friends I did so, friends as equivalent to real life where you can have one on one conversations with them.\n\nI was accused of extortion for providing a compromise of the information and sources they needed to reference, to this day they refuse to tell me why and acknowledge how they contributed to the situation, preferring to shift all blame and responsibility on me. I have a few people who left the group after seeing what happened to me, in spite of that the majority is all that matters right?",

But since guys don\u2019t feel comfortable showing their vulnerable side to other guys we tend to seek friends of the opposite sex always.\n\nNow a days, being friendly is also being considered as advances towards the opposite sex as the bar has been set low by many guys. If you can keep the conversation clean, I don\u2019t think people would mind talking for longer. Even when guys talk to other guys, I\u2019ve noticed many guys immediately getting to the subject of sex and how they are deprived of it. Talking about this one particular issue takes the conversation in the wrong direction completely. There\u2019s a ton of other topics to discuss as well. Sex too is an important topic to have but there are ways to discuss it without creeping out others. It took me a while but I\u2019ve made some really good friends out here and both guys and girls respond well when we learn to respect each others opinions and not judge them. Even if you don\u2019t accept with another persons view of life, we need to be a bit more polite and understanding out here. Don\u2019t take things personally when someone says they are busy, they genuinely can be. At the same time, let them know ur busy when ur really busy. But also make an effort to let them know when ur free again and check if they are free as well for a chat. We have had to go back to basics here and teach people a decent decorum while talking to complete strangers.\n\nIf u really want to chat with anyone and make friends, reach out to as many as you can, both guys and girls, that list gets filtered down anyways based on their mentality and personality. If they are ghosting u, don\u2019t let it affect u. Understand that they might be dealing with something we know nothing about. They could be dealing with work issues or family issues or even health problems. Give them time to reply to you. Even if it means weeks or months. I\u2019m sure you will find a few people that are genuinely lonely and enjoy a good conversation respond positively and even help u feel better. Do the same for them. This is one of the best groups on Reddit and I\u2019m really glad I have been a part of it.\n\nIf u ever need a friend to chat with, feel free to drop me a DM. I\u2019m a guy in my 30s and respond as soon as I see the messages. If I\u2019m busy, I\u2019ll reply to you saying I\u2019m busy and will message u as soon as I get free. If u just want a friend to talk to; I\u2019m more than happy to chat. I don\u2019t judge at all as I have my own share of baggage and I understand that others do to. Hope u do feel better and please do reach out when ever u want.",

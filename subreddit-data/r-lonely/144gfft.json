    "postText": "So I have this throwaway account for times like this. \n\nI have a girlfriend. A very nice girlfriend as well. Until she\u2019s not\n\nEvery time we argue (that\u2019s basically all the time nowadays) I feel like I\u2019m worthless and lonely in every possible way. It feels like nothing I do is ever good enough and then my depression hits me like a truck. Am I too scared to actually be lonely for real? It sure feels like it. But I feel lonely with her around as well. I\u2019m just a scared human writing this while intoxicated now that she\u2019s away for a couple of days, just praying that someone understands this pain I\u2019m going through. Hoped that alcohol would make the pain go away but it\u2019s not. I\u2019m scared.",

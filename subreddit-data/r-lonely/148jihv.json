    "postText": "I've been lonely for a very long time. It's been years since I've had actual friends to do things with. When I did have friends, I usually just would do what they wanted to do, because I enjoyed spending time with them and hated making decisions for myself.\n\nNow, I have no friends to do anything with, and it's made me realize... I don't care about anything. I'm not into music, sports, arts, nature, exercise, partying, animals, comedy, dancing, working... The few things I do \"enjoy\" like video games or drawing aren't even that fun to me, I just do them to pass the time. I've tried a good amount of things and nothing seems worth my time.\n\nEven worse, whenever I try to socialize with coworkers as practice, I realize that I have mo idea how to contribute to conversations. I just try my best to find the most socially acceptable thing to say and hope it works. I have no clue what I would \"want\" to say in a conversation- am I jokey, analytical, emotional, gossippy, friendly, observational? I have absolutely no idea.\n\nI really just feel like a shell of a human. I don't think there's even a way to cope with this, it's just a fact that sucks. No wonder I have no friends.",

Usually I just end up feeling worse because it solidifies my problems and shows me there is no foreseeable end to them. Plus it makes me self-conscious lol.\n\nI think I just can't feel excitement/enjoyment correctly, like at all. I even tried skydiving and felt bored like 5 minutes later...",

I guess I just don't have the mindset to see it that positively for myself, but that's on me. \n\nI've honestly always been like this, even as a kid to an extent. Everytime I am in a situation I am supposed to enjoy, the only thing I can focus on is everything wrong. Not even in a \"oh no what if an earthquake happens right now?\" way, just like nit-picking everything that has flaws or isn't perfect. It's both anxiety and a weird judgementalness.",

Like that it requires even effort to enjoy the moment?\n\nTo me it sounds like, this negative headspace is a result of something else that is let's say blocking you",

I don't have friends, I'm grateful for every little thing i have in life, but sometimes I'm pessimistic.\n\nI enjoy a lot of things and mostly open minded. My hobbies include digital painting, art in general, cooking, watching rom coms.\n\nI love to talk about business and entrepreneurship. I'm emotional and sensitive (sorry about that). Firm believer in kindness and empathy. \n\nAnyone who read this post, have a nice day ahead!",

It's just the idea of having a woman talking to me makes me feel at ease whereas talking to a man is just... A problem solving workshop \n\nEven now, we can all shower concern for each other and it's just a \"yeah fuck it sucks.\" But if a woman do that then a part of me goes \"oh look, it's care and love\" ( I know it's not love but my heart is stupid ) \n\nLonely epidemic. It's just such a fucked up game rn",

If your life's value is chasing your own dreams and goals then any act in furtherance of those dreams or goals will be justified by your soul. However if you view life's value as being determined by how others view you, then to achieve value is to put the needs of others before yourself. \n\nI know that I can feel good about myself when I help someone in need. I also know that achieving what I want feels good. The problem is that there is a conflict between putting your goals first and putting the goals of others first. Both cannot be first. Is it your smile or the smiles of those around you that you find more important? \n\nI have thoughts on picking either side, and thoughts on trying to play to both sides, but ultimately I can say my soul resonates with one option more than others.",

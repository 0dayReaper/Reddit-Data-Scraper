Granted, you can still have lonely attractive people, but that generally happens if they're so in their own head about something or if they choose to be alone. Like maybe if they keep finding other people disappointing them and keep walking away from friends, family, romantic partners, maybe they find others disingenuous.\n\nBut I think when an attractive person realizes they really want to get someone else to like them, they are WAY better off. And for a lot of us, that's the very reason why we are here is because we cannot do that if our lives depend on it.",

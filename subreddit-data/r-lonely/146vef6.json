    "postText": "I think the realization that i should just accept whatever romantic relations i had w men online are gonna be the only romantic feelings im gonna experience just sank in.\n\nit seems out of my reach to experience anything of that sort irl \n\ni went on a date with this person i knew today, he's good looking and overall seems like a very chill and vibey person. However halfway through i just self sabotaged and shut down. To the point where i think it made him really bored. The demeanor i seem to have online seems very different from the one i have irl and it kinda just made me sad. '\n\nI feel pretty pathetic i feel really lonely romantically, and these are feelings ive never felt before cause for the longest time i felt content. \n\nIg i just feel pretty overwhelmed and upset at everything.",

So it's good to use Reddit to vent and say whatever you want. \n\nI use Reddit as a tool to let the steam off but when I go out into the world I'm better able to handle myself in situations or detect situations that i should be avoiding.\n\nThis situation you're describing sounds like you are so used to relationships or potential relationships failing that when the guy showed up and checked all the initial boxes your fear took control.\n\nAlot of people want to get out of a bad situation and level up but if that opportunity were to arrive a lot of folks would fumble the moment",

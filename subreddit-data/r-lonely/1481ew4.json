Don\u2019t let a baby stop you from living a life you can be happy with.",

The state can provide free babysitting, and you don\u2019t need to start paying off college debt until 6 months after graduation, so you can get a higher education that opens lots of employment opportunities for you.  You can get free transportation and scholarships and all sorts of things that can help.  But you have to seek out the information.",

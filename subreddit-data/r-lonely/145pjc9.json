    "postText": "I met this guy on vacation. He and I hung out for three days and had a solid connection. He and I would just talk for hours on end. He told mutual friends that he liked me. I wasn't supposed to find out, but everyone told me. All my friends were hyping me up saying \"oh, he likes you\u201d, or \"look, your boyfriend's here!\" \n\nI went up to my crush and asked him if he liked me. He told me that he had a girlfriend. After, he blew up on our friends, texting them \"why'd you tell her?\" and \"you promised me you wouldn't say anything!\" Our friend were shocked about the girlfriend, but no one believed it. It seemed like he made it up because he was too embarrassed to admit he liked me. So I requested to follow him on social media. He left it pending for two weeks before rejecting it. It was then that I knew he really did have a girlfriend, because he clearly did like me, so would he say no? I overreacted, and I blocked him. \n\nTwo months later, they broke up. Literal days after, he started looking at my social media. It's been two years, and he always looks at it. I know that it doesn't mean anything. I get that sometimes people are curious to see what other people are up to, but let me ask you this: if you feel whatever about someone, are you going to be looking at their profiles everyday? I don't forgive him. Even though he was right to reject the request, he's not this noble person. No one made him say that he liked me. He chose to do that all on his own. I may accept him as a partner, but he\u2019d better get ready to apologize for the rest of his life.",

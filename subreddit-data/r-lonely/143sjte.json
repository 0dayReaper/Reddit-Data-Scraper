I dont have a lot of friends but the few I have would chose other friends over me. But I am so happy when I can talk to someone for longer time. It makes me happy that they are not bored when talking with me. Yesterday I had a long conversation with my friend and at the end he said that he really enjoyed talking with me and that left me very happy that someone enjoyed talking with me. I often feel like I am not good enough so this really helps me.",

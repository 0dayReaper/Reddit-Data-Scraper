    "postText": "So I had to put my dog down yesterday which was absolutely heartbreaking. I ended up posting about it on my Insta last night and just went on to check to see someone who I thought was a friend had unfollowed me after seeing that post (I know they would\u2019ve had to see it cause I rarely post so my account usually wouldn\u2019t pop up). Like how heartless can you be? Yea if you don\u2019t want to follow me anymore that\u2019s fine but like to unfollow someone after seeing that their dog died like wtf",

Their partner deleted me like within minutes of finding out I was Sa\u2019d but they\u2019ve always been very judgey so wouldn\u2019t surprise me if they\u2019ve rubbed off on them \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f either way tho if you see someone\u2019s dog just died like probs not the best time to unfollow could\u2019ve waited a couple days especially when you were supposedly their \u201cfriend\u201d. They haven\u2019t removed me from their followers so it\u2019s not about not wanting to interact with me anymore",

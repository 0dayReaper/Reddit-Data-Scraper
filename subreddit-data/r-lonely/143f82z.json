            "comment": "aww I'm really sorry ab that, coming from a 19F who has/had mommy issues I think you should treat the human in your head kindly. you are more than capable of greatness, and you don't even realize it. That little human inside of your head is already proud of you and its not because of what you have or haven't done. It's simply because you are you, and that is amazingly wonderful on its own.\n\njust for a little perspective, the starting of my healing was one day, a voice in my head just spoke to me like I wish my mother would have and said:\n\n* I love you because XYZ\n* You make me proud because XYX\n* I think you are funny because XYZ\n* I am so in love you because XYZ\n\nI did this self-talk (sort of a meditative trance because I concentrated really hard on feeling the presence of someone to lay my head on and just the general warm spirit) for a week, and it has helped me tremendously. It's made me realize that I just need to keep making myself proud and my mother-me figure just wants me to be happy.\n\nIt sounds a bit insane but when I concentrate on that motherly feeling that I've been missing all my life, I feel strong enough to go about my plans when no one else cares/believes in me/doubts. I know I'm living the right life when I follow her voice.\n\nThere's a lot of forgiveness that comes along with this\u2013forgiving your mother, forgiving yourself, recognizing that the way you treat yourself is not right, and changing your future decisions.",

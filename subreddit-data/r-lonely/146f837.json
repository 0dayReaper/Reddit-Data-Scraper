    "postText": "Simply put my boyfriend is my only friend and I hate that for me. I love him very much and i\u2019m glad he\u2019s my friend, I just wish I had more. When he hangs out with his friends I give him the space he deserves and keep contact to a minimum (generally just checking in on him before i gts) but i\u2019m kinda jealous that he has friends and gets to do things with them while I\u2019m friendless. I\u2019ve been trying bumble friends to make friends but something about friendships in your 20\u2019s just feels impossible. I hate that when i\u2019m not with him i\u2019m just chilling by myself not doing/making any plans to meet up with friends to grab or drink or just hang out. I\u2019m trying to change it. I know i can change it. Rn it just sucks that I only have one friend lol",

He saw I was sad but I told him I was ok and to go have fun. I haven\u2019t tried Bumble Friends yet but maybe I will now. Practice makes perfect I guess is what they say.",

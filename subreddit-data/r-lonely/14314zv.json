Rest your hands on your shoulders or upper arm ( just above your biceps)\n\n3. Imagine the type of hug you want \n\n4. Squeeze yourself with just enough pressure to create the sensation your looking for \n\nI think we could all could use a hug on this page :) just saw this and it helped me a little bit.

    "postText": "I have been on a journey to figure out how to help men who are lonely. I have found a plethora of valuable resources with clear actionable steps to take. With very high confidence that (if actions are taken) - it would have a measurable impact on one's sense of loneliness.\n\nTo make it sweet and simple - I have started to combine these findings in a written \u201cguide\u201d. For now - I have written the first chapter on \u201cfinding your purpose\u201d.\n\nI would appreciate it if you could check out this guide and give feedback on the first chapter. It is still a work in progress.\n\nWhen this guide will be done - it should help anyone from this subreddit as the aim should be to actually get rid of loneliness and not just to talk about it.\n\nLink to Google doc - [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GO\\_Cvk1CGUreHdpmVl04EVHQtjQ2OXeOzDH3R5kSKJ4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GO_Cvk1CGUreHdpmVl04EVHQtjQ2OXeOzDH3R5kSKJ4/edit?usp=sharing)",

    "postText": "I (31M) feel like I\u2019ve exhausted a lot of resources in trying to rebuild my social life. A lot of my friends have settled down with marriage, kids etc and I see them sporadically these days.\n\nThe times in between feel very lonely outside of work. Local meet-ups get cancelled last minute, gym workouts feel like a chore and I\u2019m not getting any matches through dating apps.\n\nI\u2019m at that stage where I need a helping hand in rebuilding my social life whilst having someone to take care of me when at my lowest. It sounds kinda cringey but that\u2019s what I feel as single man living alone.\n\nAnyone else experiencing similar to this?",

I don\u2019t have a lot of friends anyway, but they\u2019re married and in some cases have kids etc. I am lucky if I meet up with someone once ever 4 or 5 months. I can see people at work but to be honest at times that makes me feel even more lonely. They\u2019re a great bunch of people but they have their own little friend groups that I\u2019m not a part of and it makes me sad.\n\nWell done for trying to do stuff though like go to the gym etc, you\u2019re doing way better than I am. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through the same thing it feels terrible",

While it can be lonely and painful, I think there are positives to the ways our journeys have gone. I don\u2019t want to speak for you, but I didn\u2019t get tied up in relationships and friends when I was young and dumb that may have stunted my personal growth/caused trauma, no ugly breakups or toxic friendships that added more drama to my life than needed. \n\nWhile life does feel lonely, I think it\u2019s a good time to reflect that we\u2019re all going through stuff and have each others back. If you need to talk let me know man.",

Or maybe I'm shitty at picking and matching with people.\n\nIt would be phenomenal to have a best friend in life. Someone to lean on in the low times. I have kids so when I have them I tend to be pretty good, but any time when is no one is around, depression comes banging at the door to remind me how unlovable I am. Brains can be really dumb. \n\nIt's ongoing work trying to be cool with ourselves.",

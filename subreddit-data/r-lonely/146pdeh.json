    "postText": "So i 22m, and my classmate I see almost daily at school are rly close friends. I'm almost always the happiest when I'm with them, but when apart I get into the deepest depression. Or when I see them having fun talking with other people, I know how toxic that sounds, I never act on it and try not to show it but that's just how I feel, and I can't stop it.\n\nI always try to do things for them to show that I care about our friend ship since I'm not the greatest with words or showing my emotions. I like to do crafts for them and bring extra lunch some times, and give them rides to and from school. Anything to spend more time with them I guess. \n\nThey say we are eachothers best friends. But they seem to have coutless other friends, while it feels like they are my world im just some guy to them. It hurts but it's the most connection I've ever had and it feels so good but so horrible at the same time. I feel like I need reasurance but I don't want to be horrible and toxic and ruin what a great thing we have, I'm already so scared that I have ruined it and it's on its way out and I'll go back to being completely isolated. \n\nI'm not the greatest writer as you can see but thank you for listening, I wish the best for you all.",

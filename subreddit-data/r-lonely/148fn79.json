    "postText": "I recently (just earlier today) checked myself into a mental health center because I\u2019ve been told I can\u2019t comprehend basic sentences while in the midst of arguing with my partner. I\u2019ve also been feeling like I\u2019ve been losing my memory as well as overstepping my boundaries as an individual. \n\nAll of this has made me feel stupid and really unworthy for sharing my thoughts on waiting for more than 7-8 months for a sublease as well as having that date pushed back multiple times up til this day. I have never mentioned this to them until last night, ended up also mentioning I am looking for my own space since the one were \u201cwaiting for\u201d is taking a while, and got met with tone change and abrasiveness. Which according to them. Isn\u2019t tone change or abrasiveness. And is simply a response to the impatience I am displaying. Which isn\u2019t really me being impatient?? Because I\u2019ve been so open and understanding about the dates being pushed. But I am currently in a position where I NEED my own space. I have no privacy. Anywhere. I have a space available for me to sleep in at my parents but it\u2019s not what I want. No door. No aircon. All my shit I deteriorated or getting there. Idk. I\u2019m just tired.\n\nAfter mentioning that I was looking for a space, they brought up how am I going to pay for my rent with no stable job and I said I\u2019m capable of making this mfkn money. \n\nIm also kinda trying my best not to be so angry or upset at my partner for wanting to be out later after work. Often. Like. 3-5x a week. Sometimes until 2-4am no calls or messages. And it gets even worse when I DO try to initiate contact and get left to my own thoughts for HOURS. Feeling like I\u2019m being punished for checking up on them in a timely manner (1-1.5 hrs each checkup). I know he\u2019s not cheating but I\u2019m also in a space where that kind of behavior is making me rethink a lot of plans we\u2019ve made throughout the earlier months of our relationship. \n\nIt\u2019s much more detailed than that. \n\nJust looking for some friends to take my mind off of it. I feel so anxiety ridden and am anxious AND nervous AND excited for my checkup at the mental hospital. \n\nI feel like it\u2019ll clarify a lot of things that have led me to be the anxiety ridden person I am today. And to clarify my thoughts on how to navigate a relationship I\u2019d love to save. But unsure if it\u2019s worth saving with our communication differences and just life choices in general. \n\nAnyway. If you read all of that, thank you. I would love input\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t have any, I\u2019m down for a simple/silly conversion as well \n\nReally in my head right now and would appreciate the company. Thanks so much",

It does sound to me like your boyfriend kind of not care anymore.\n\nMy advice, focus on your mental health first. If you go to mental health center, make sure to spend time on really figuring out which meds are working for you, you seem to me like you might have a bit of ADHD (trouble focusing, anxiety) and there are meds that work miracles for this.\n\nThen next step spend time to find a job that you actually like, it will make a world of difference for your self-esteem. Be thankful that at least you have a place to stay while you are searching for nice job. When i stayed at my moms place, there was also no aircon or doors, it is what it is.\n\nOnly then you will be on stable ground enough to make proper choices regarding relationships and living. Dont worry, its hard but things take time to get much better.\n\nFeel free to message me later on, but really try mental health help first.",

Making friends seems to work for so many people, but where I live it's impossible to get people to get out of their shells and accept new people and friends. I feel so stuck.",

Instead of discussing my personal struggles, I would like to share how I coped with those challenges. One helpful approach is to make new friends, which can expose you to different perspectives and ways of thinking.  \n\n\nTalking of new friends, you can start with me (Hahahah) just kidding.",

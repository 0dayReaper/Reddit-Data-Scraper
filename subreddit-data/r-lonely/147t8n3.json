    "postText": "Confessed to a good female friend few days ago before leaving town to visit my hometown. In this half a year she treated me in ways that I feel so touched where my ex and family never even did for me. She had been supportive when during my most stressful time, offering help, being there in person for me when I didn\u2019t ask for it. It just hard to not fall in love for it. \n\nUsed to be texting sending reels daily but still no response from her since then, so clearly is a no I guess. I plan to move on since that\u2019s kinda my original plan if it doesn\u2019t work (plus idk will I be seeing her again before I even confessed, cuz future is unpredictable). But she is just so perfect, never met anyone like her.",

            "comment": "Apparently good platonic female-male bondings can happen if you can get over this stage while respecting that they are not into it romantically. I havent experienced anything like that but recently read about this. Apparently most female-male friendships do go through this phase, and based on what people involved decide, they can either stay platonic or go separate ways. Think what would work best for you, while also respecting their feelings. Best of luck.",

Is just her actions to me make me felt important, this feeling just keeps stacking up once getting closer to my graduation\u2026 the last hitting point makes my heart melt we\u2019re she drove down to see my graduation herself when one of her arm just got done with surgery\u2026 I really want to tell her but I haven\u2019t really felt that loved in my life, not even in my previous relationships. I know she just doing it as friend but this makes just hit me hard.",

It can work, but you have to let that sexual tension build up and escalate so you can judge her reactions and act accordingly. If you just dropped that on her out of nowhere, that's might have been a big shock for her and she is processing it still. If you had no indication that she was attracted to you, and let that out, you might have damaged the friendship. Give her time to process it, and let her come to you. If she doesn't, it's probably over.",

But I\u2019m leaving town to visit my hometown and graduated, don\u2019t know will I see her again that\u2019s kinda why I said it. And I don\u2019t want FWB relationship with her but a\n\nIdk but I probably know she have no feelings before I tell her, but just want to make things clear about how I feel. But her actions warmed me so much, that was one night she can tell I was depressed and she offered to stay in my car to talks until 5 am then she leave with asking me twice \u201cshould I go?\u201d When i kinda tell her to go home when it was so late and she need to study. Then last action she really got my heart was when she drove to my graduation herself with an injured arm after surgery even I told her not to, I know she is being nice, but that just got me there\u2019s since then I can\u2019t stop thinking about her.",

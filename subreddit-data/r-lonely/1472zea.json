    "postText": "I have been thinking about this a lot lately, I feel like I have a pretty full life, I have family, a child (single mom), friends, and get tons of dms on here and other social media platforms, but I always feel lonely, like nobody gets me, like people don\u2019t actually truly care about me aside from my immediate family. It almost feels like my heart doesn\u2019t connect with people and when it does, those people don\u2019t stick around long. It\u2019s almost like my heart is lonely if that makes any sense. Doesn\u2019t anyone ever feel this way.",

It\u2019s like no matter how hard you try you always feel like people aren\u2019t understanding what you\u2019re saying even on the most base level. \n\nI get the same thing. I get called different or weird because of how my personality is and it\u2019s super difficult to connect with anyone on even just a basic level.",

When it comes to relationships i need to feel like it goes deeper than just \u201chow was your day\u201d \u201cwhat\u2019s up\u201d so much more so, and not a lot of people feel that way. People these days make a connection and are so easily ready to just never speak or see you again. I stay connected to everyone I meet. Being a woman I feel that a lot of the times that I do make some kind of connection it ends up being used for more sexual purposes on their end.",

It leaves me feeling used a lot of the times, and very hard to deal with especially if I have genuine feelings or had hope for something more. I love to talk to people and am quite friendly and kind, but I also have my guards up a lot in fear of being hurt because it happens a lot.",

I find for me what works is managing expectations when I meet new people. \n\nI generally have like a verbal disclaimer that I give to people when I meet up or talk with them to get to know them more. It\u2019s not like \u201cwhere is this going\u201d \n\nMore like \u201chey I\u2019m this kind of person and I really like when I can get to know people\u201d and I find it helps to turn away people that interested in only one thing.",

Never feeling like I\u2019m worth more than a little time here and there, never wanting to have conversation, expected to damn near do everything around the house and still everything and everyone gets her time while I silently feel more alone.",

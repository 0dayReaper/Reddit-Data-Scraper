    "postText": "It's the harsh truth that you can't please everyone. It's a mentality that I've attempted to take for a long time - especially considering that, as a person, I am flawed. I have been able to recognise that I'm not always compassionate or empathetic and that is a problem with myself that I need to try and knock down and make better of myself. Nonetheless, the point still stands that you can't please everyone.\n\nEven though that is the case, why is it so hard for me to find out that someone doesn't like me? Why do I find it so hard when I realise that - oh wait, that person doesn't want to be my friend any more. That person doesn't like me any more. That person thinks I'm horrible. Why does that still hurt, even when I try and take the apathetic route of accepting that you cant please everyone? It doesn't make sense to me.\n\nToday, not only did I find out that there's yet another person that doesn't like me due to my past actions - stuff I won't share for personal reasons, but I will state were over a year ago for the most part and I've constantly been trying to better myself - but that these actions are painting me not very well in the broad circle of my community. Apparently most people my age don't like me, and I'm lucky to have the friends I have. That really got me. It shouldn't - I try and not let it bother me that not everyone will like me - but I hate that my past makes people see me this way. I wish I could change how I was, but I can't, and even as much as I try and be a better person, it seems like who I was when I was younger is always gonna haunt me socially.\n\nSo yeah, why does it hurt so much when finding out stuff like this? Even if you can accept that not everyone will like you, why is it so hurtful whenever you hear of yet another person disliking you? I really don't understand.",

Whether it be love, friendship, job application, finances, etc.\n\nRejection when you don\u2019t know or can\u2019t understand the reason is the painful part, in my opinion anyway. Even more so when you have little to no say in influencing the decision.\n\nMy two cents, for what it\u2019s worth!",

The same thing goes for people and sometimes there\u2019s not even a reason for it, so seek the ones who appreciate who you are and your effort to be better. Not everyone is going to see your value as it is, everyone has different perspectives and as long as you know you\u2019re doing better for yourself that\u2019s all that really matters because at the end of the day no one knows you better than you know yourself",

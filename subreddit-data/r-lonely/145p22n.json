There was definitely a time where i felt like, ok maybe im the problem or its my fault but i dont think so anymore. i can only control what i can control. i cant be everything for everyone so if theres something i cant give u, im sorry but theres a reason. and if im not a priority in ur life anymore, im sure theres a reason. Lets just be honest with each other. its the easiest way, unless u like leaving things to the imagination. i dont. ive been through absolute hell this year and im tired of disrespect, lies and neglect. things are getting better for me for the first time in a long time and if ur here with me to see it or not is completely ur choice at this point.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone, I'm Alvina. It's been three years since I finally got out of the relationship,\r  \n\r  \nWe have been together for two years. In the past two years, we have experienced many things and have many good memories. However, recently I discovered that he hooked up with other women behind my back, and even dated some women. When I knew all this, I was very disappointed and sad.\r  \n\r  \nI've always thought there was a deep bond between us and he's always been nice to me. However, his cheating made me unacceptable. I think if a person really loves you, he will not do this kind of thing that hurts you.\r  \n\r  \nAlthough the breakup is painful, I believe that time will heal everything. I will love myself well and start my life anew. At the same time, I also hope that he can realize his mistakes and correct them.\r  \n\r  \nFinally, what I want to say is that love needs to be maintained by both parties. If there is a problem with one party, it will be difficult for the relationship to continue.",

When she was back at it again it was me who stopped due to depression. \n\n\n&gt;Although the breakup is painful, I believe that time will heal everything. I will love myself well and start my life anew.\n\nVery nice to read you keep a positive spirit, please don't fall into the bitterness like I did, keep fighting :)",

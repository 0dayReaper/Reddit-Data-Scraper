    "postText": "Its hard to even put the loneliness i feel into words. I just...exist. I notice regularly that i go days without speaking. I regularly feel this overwhelming feeling of sadness and loneliness but i never have anywhere to turn to so it swallows me. The only family i had was my mom and she passed, that same week my girlfriend who was my absolute biggest support system left me and that threw me into a pit that i still dont think ive crawled out of. Every couple months i go through the same process of downloading tinder or something of the sorts, get no matches, delete and repeat. Over the years my friends dwindled and the last few remaining friendships i had didnt survive through covid. So now here i am. I live in my car feeling the deepest loneliness i couldnt even dream of as a child almost daily. Why am i posting this? I just want to feel like im talking to someone for once.\n\nEdit: i know its not much but wow thats the most likes ive gotten on any platform",

We could be sick in a war torn country experiencing chemical warfare watching our neighbors turn into corpses as rats feed on them in the streets. Does that make me feel any better? No. No it doesn't. I could be a sex slave. I could be a POW getting tortured for information I don't know. Why even bother bringing up that it could be worse? What purpose does that serve other than to attempt to diminish the suffering of another? You gonna tell me I should be grateful and eat my food because there are starving kids in Africa? Give me a break.\n\nWhy should potential suffering or the suffering of others make me feel better? That only works when you compare and try to make yourself feel puffed up by looking down on those living lives deemed \"lower\" than your own. But comparing myself to others is toxic. And I'm not seeking to compare my lesser suffering to others who suffer more because it doesn't make me feel better. At most that would only serve to make me feel like I can't talk about it. Like I should be grateful for my suffering because it isn't as bad. Like my suffering matters very little because someone out there has it worse. It's really dumb. I wish people would just cut it out with that nonsense. There are far better ways to emotionally support someone. Your way is toxic and I hope you stop. It doesn't actually make anyone feel better. It just shuts them up. There are better ways to express that you think gratitude should be a focal point rather than disappointment.\n\n Besides, an argument could be made that knowing, for real in terms of experience, what a relationship brings and losing it hurts more than the fantasy of what it might bring. What good is \"knowing what a relationship *was* like\" if you're still alone in the end? Tortured with memories of a rose tinted past and having to fight the urge to compare your present experience with that time? Knowing that your ex has moved on and has been successful in replacing you while you're still stuck where they left you? Does that really sound so much more appealing than your predicament? Not to mention the potential emotional hell that led up to the breakup and the hell that came after it.... Comparing suffering will get you nowhere.",

I'm skinny fat (mostly cause I'm in my final year of college and health took a back seat til I graduate) and I'm broke (again cause I'm in college)... so I'm not trolling",

I download tinder or any other social media again after deleting them a million times to see what people I don't care about are up to.  I honestly think it's just a distraction from my loneliness.  I shut it out as a temporary solution but I can only numb the pain away for so long.  I also feel just like you in that I can't relate to guys my age.  As men, we're taught that to show our emotions is a sign of weakness and incompetence.  Most men submit to the norms of society and conform.  I can't seem to find a group of guys who aren't afraid to show their emotional sides.  I just always meet your basic college bros that like to drink, party, and hookups.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just not for me.  I'm trying therapy for the first time so I hope that'll help.  I ran away from home and slept in my car last night.  I was going to travel all the way to California.  But I woke up and started to cry.  It's not the first time I ran away.  I guess I'm learning that I can't outrun my mental health issues.  I already told a lot of people I was traveling.  It's going to be painful to come home and have everyone see me as a failure.  But I'm tired of running.  I'm going to take my loneliness and depression headon and not let it beat me.  I'm sick and tired of living like this.",

I can't live without someone in my life but they never stay once they realise how much of a mess I am (I have BPD basically). I have some very good male friends but they are away. And it's just... not the same as female company.\n\nI feel like my only company is my car. It's the sole safe harbour I have. Without her I'm dead.\n\nI can especially relate to the \"high school bros\" thing. When I look around me it seems these guys just got in life with some manual on how to date and be a \"normal person\" that I didn't have. Basically they are all about competition and trying to fuck as much as they can. I don't like that. But it's what girls expect. If you're not like that they find you odd. Like for some reason I read all the time that it's men who don't want to commit. I want to commit but I'm so overwhelming they always leave me. Maybe we can have some chat if you want.",

            "comment": "Hey there. This post really resonated with me because I can relate to this feeling.\n\nFirst off, I want to say sorry for your loss. A couple years ago, my mom (also my only family) was diagnosed with colon cancer and my sister and I had to watch her live everyday in pain. It was jarring. We never saw it coming and my partner ended up cheating on me and losing all contact and interest in me while my mom was battling cancer. My partner was also my only support system. Then the pandemic happened and I lost all opportunities to even distract myself from the pain. It was like the world took a gigantic dump on me and told me to live with it.\n\nThe ~6 months following it was the worst. I felt alone and lost and everyday I wished I hadn\u2019t even woke up. But then some good news came. My mom beat cancer and is now in remission. I started therapy again and it helped a bit, and I also got a job that kept me busy and out of the house. Sadly, I ended up abusing drugs and ultimately overdosed, but I was able to live thanks to some kind people. As much as the pain sucked, I thank it for teaching me to not take things for granted and to start giving myself more kindness.\n\nYou did not deserve this, and it was terrible of your girlfriend to leave you in such a vulnerable, dark period of your life. She did not deserve you and you deserved to have a consistent support system. That is on her, not you. Your pain is valid, and it will take time to process, but just know her being an awful person/partner is not any reflection of you. She\u2019ll have to carry the consequences of being selfish. I know it sounds like the furthest thing from the truth but love WILL find you. It can be a painful journey, but someone right will enter your life, and these moments sometimes happen when you least expect it. I am now in a better relationship with someone I bonded with through work and while I\u2019m still fighting some battles, I can say I am in a better place.\n\nChange doesn\u2019t happen instantly, so never be discouraged and don\u2019t ignore or push away new opportunities. You deserve happiness and love and I hope you recognize that, you deserve to feel good about yourself and see how strong you are. I think there is light at the end of the tunnel, and sometimes that light may be dim or another tunnel comes after, but the light will be there. This isn\u2019t forever.\n\nYou have the support of me and a lot of people reading this. You\u2019re not alone. Find hobbies, treat yourself, keep a journal, do some volunteering. These are all good options, and there are many more you can find that will work for you and bring you some happiness. Progress is never linear and everything you\u2019re feeling is valid. Please see yourself as a human worthy of respect, happiness, and love and make sure you\u2019re focusing on how you view yourself. Screw what other people think, this is your life not theirs. Things such as tinder does not accurately judge or define you as a person. \n\nIt may not seem like it, but there\u2019s a reason for everything and you will find happiness again. Find it in yourself, find it in the small things, but don\u2019t be hard on yourself for feeling this way either. You\u2019re allowed to feel sadness and loneliness, just don\u2019t let it consume you or keep you from finding happiness.\n\nBest wishes. Hope this helped a bit.",

Maybe it\u2019s because you\u2019ve lost your purpose of life and maybe all the people in your environment had kept you away from really growing to someone who you always wanted to be..? \n\nI know it sounds corny/clich\u00e9 asf, but as a sportsman a few years ago I was really lost and my environment kept me away from thinking clearly. Then there was this long period of loneliness and depression ( still not recovered btw )  where eventually I got back on track and started doing what I love the most. Loneliness really sucks man, but maybe it\u2019s a sign that you have to work on yourself for a while. ( Like quit the smoking, read more books, go to the gym, try to travel more, try to do more research on something you find interesting etc etc. ) \n\nGood luck!!",

I\u2019m sorry for saying this, but I think your loneliness is gonna be your savior eventually. \n\nDon\u2019t be afraid for change and development man. If you think your environment is not good for you, don\u2019t rely on them. If you think your study or work doesn\u2019t mean anything to you, Change it!! But change it at the moment you\u2019ve finally found your purpose again. Try to improve yourself by trying different things ( like working out, reading, travelling )and I can guarantee you that within a few years the results will shock you in a positive way.",

You have to be your own best friend. Then I would say join some team sports, initiate things like ask if ppl wanna go out for a drink afterwards.

I can\u2019t speak for everyone but as a gay man I have always found it difficult to make friends with straight men. It just doesn\u2019t seem to happen organically for some reason, I guess a part of it is our diverging interests romantically and sexually, a lot of men bond over talking about women and I literally can only reciprocate with the opposite stories. Whereas the opposite is true with straight women, most of whom love having a \u201cgay best friend.\u201d But that\u2019s a topic for another place. \n\nPoint being I have a few close straight male mates who are cool and comfortable around me and I love them for being down to earth and drama free. The cliques and politics of the LGBT+ community can get a bit much it\u2019s nice to just chill with them instead, so if you find a lonely gay guy who also genuinely wants a friend I\u2019d say go for it, you got nothing to lose.",

            "comment": "I'm so sorry that you are going through this right now, the pandemic is bringing down a lot of relationships because it's an extraordinary circumstance, but even without covid many people still feel the same pain of loneliness that you are feeling right now. So let me start by saying that you are not alone in this, and I think other comments already validate that fact.\n\nWhen we are in pain sometimes we don't notice ourselves building higher and higher walls, which makes us feel even more lonely, to a point where it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. I recommend that you do a quick assessment of your current connections and friendships, then work your way up from that.\n\nIt's also worth assessing ourselves to see where we can improve. Are there behaviors that we do that might be turning people off from us? If you can't answer this, ask a close friend of what they think about you on this matter and try not to take their answers personally\u2014it's feedback on what you should be working on within yourself.\n\nConnecting with other people is hard when we stop trying or when we kill off our chances before we even start trying. There's a lot more cure to loneliness than just hooking up with a stranger on tinder. People on tinder only use tinder for one thing which is something that you might not be needing right now. It's like going to a hardware store trying to look for an apple\u2014there is an off-chance you might find an apple there but you know damn well that they don't sell apples at a hardware store. If you are looking for a friend then go to a place where you might make friends and not shoot yourself in the foot by trying to get emotionally vulnerable with people who are just in it for a quick lay and not interested in actually getting to know you.\n\nWhat worked for me is that I started joining communities based on my interest and scoped up people from the crowd that I vibe with. I ended up with life-long friends that I share lots of other interests with. Maybe you can use that too? Pick a subreddit, reach out and of course, be mindful of your manners. :) It also helps being a better friend to people who are already sticking by you. I stopped putting more focus on strangers and started prioritizing friendships that saved me and have been there for me through thick and thin. These are people that already like you, so you wouldn't have to try too hard being yourself anymore and you can just work on reciprocating how to be a good friend to them in return.\n\nAs for being a guy, I guess this is one of the harmful side effects of toxic masculinity that got ingrained in our society. Growing up you have been conditioned that being vulnerable and sharing your emotions with others is a weakness you need to get rid of. But buddy, you are human no matter what gender you are. Your emotions are valid, your pain is valid, and you are being brave and strong for even sharing your feelings out here. Strength comes in many forms: vulnerability is a strength, empathy is a strength, being able to love and care for others is a strength. \n\nBeing self-aware is the first step, asking for help is the next, and now you can take your time to work on your negative behaviors or things about yourself that you can improve on. Progress isn't linear so take it one day at a time. What matters is you keep working on it.\n\nSo to sum it up, fight this loneliness by giving yourself a higher chance of climbing out of it. Look for friends in the right places, or work on your existing friendships. You don't need a lot, just a couple of few good ones to help you pull through. Good luck and I hope you find yourself in a better place physically and mentally soon!",

I was in a relationship for 2 years with another woman I was in love with who recently left me. I can honestly say even when you have moments  where you have people around you and shouldnt feel alone, you do. Part of the reason my ex left is my depression. Most days I keep to myself. Days I have my children I'm there for them but I know I'm dying inside. I often go in to another room and cry so they dont see it. Then they go back to their mom and I completely shut down. I'm on the verge of losing my job of 11 years, I'm on day 7 of a suspension from work. I cant even find the joy in drugs or alcohol to ease any of the pain. I really feel like I hang on to life because I dont want to ruin the lives of my kids. lonliness comes in many forms. Some would say i have a lot to be happy about but when you're not happy within yourself nothing else matters. I've done the tinder thing to waste time with people I'll never reach out to.  So yes, everyday is lonely. I wish it would stop I wish I could fix it but right now it's where I'm at. I wouldnt mind life ending. But here I am writing this lonely post to try to ease some of the lonliness.",

I know so many people in my life- in my family and friend groups- who just seem okizay with droning through their life never truly happy. I get that it can't be all sunshine and rainbows 100% of the time- but why does it feel like that's always dwindling closer to 10% or less of the time? \n\nThis world is cold, and shitty. And many of us are being told we need menial shit to feel satisfied in life. I'd gladly share my life with someone who can both not screw me over and also even WANT to share that. If I keep all my life to me- I'm basically dead. And it's funny, because reaching out to someone recently confirmed this when they replied that they were wondering if I was even alive. Bittersweet right there. \n\nIt feels like I'm just meant to reach out to people and help them be alive until I drain out and die. I see plenty of options- but I don't see many paths that will truly lead me to happiness in the end. \n\nLonesome rich dude with everything in the world and nobody worthwhile to share it with... I feel like that's a future page in my book. But I don't want to feel crippling loneliness and wait for death- no more or less than anybody else would I imagine. I want real relationships with sustanance and trust. Everywhere I turn, I see someone I can help rather than be equals with. And when I do find someone level headed with me- it's usually over the internet. Which I'm still grateful for don't get me wrong. It just isn't enough for me. \n\nRisking sounding a bit grandiose- I honestly feel like a lot of people can see value in having me as their friend- but that's a problem and it's not even for the money. I really want people to feel good deep in their own hearts. I want to help them see they don't even need me to find that. I feel like many times I have been a great guide for the lost. (Classic, enthusiastic about helping everyone but myself.) For me though, I rely on a few \"idols\" and their words or philosophies about this life. But most of those people don't know me- and nor I them. How could they? I'm practically nobody. Some of my old friends and acquaintances indeed think I may have died. \n\nAlmost have to lol about it really. Any day or moment- any of those friends were free to hit me up if they wanted. At some point I deleted pointless social media accounts I had but never really had a use for. What, go back to 2009 and post edgy vague shit or about what I'm eating everyday? Nah. Maybe for money, but nah. Social media just made me feel sick about everyone's apparent internal fantasy worlds and judgments fueled by each others approval. Makes me sick to know I used to be one of those people.\n\nI guess to cut this short and stfu, I gotta end saying that I consider *this* type of comment and post more valuable than anything I ever felt or posted on Facebook. These are some truly existential thoughts, and I hope a few people read them and dig deep into their own true feelings. We have enough people wearing fake faces for each other. This world is just an ever growing mess of self destructive fads right now. Before you know it, everybody is just gonna be wearing the same threads living in the same hive house thinking the same hive thoughts... How ultimately bland is that image?... it sounds like the rows of houses in the in the 70's-80's that looked like framebuffers across the land. \n\nEh... advice? Be yourself. That's not my own advice, but I agree with it.",

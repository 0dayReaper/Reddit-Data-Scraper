I'm diagnosed with anxiety and depression and seeing happy couples can surprisingly be very, very triggering. I keep on thinking, why can't it be me? Why can't anyone love me? There must be something wrong with me. How can people move from one relationship to another while I can't even get one? It makes me sick to the stomach. I'm disgusted of myself, yet I am my only company. For I have no one.",

Learning a lot about myself, much much healthier state of mind lately, generally speaking.  \nI'm learning about my *codependency*  and how it has really pushed people away in my life, and I'm learning to take care and address my own needs more.\n\n\nCurrently in a doomed one-way relationship with someone who did a complete 180 after 2 months of talking. So that's no fun, but I'm learning things that are really going to fix me,  Still working on figuring out how to end things with people that aren't giving back. It's been a rough 2 weeks now since she did the 180 but I'm thinking about just ending it this week honestly, she has photos and posts of her exes on her TikTok, but recently she deleted the one video of us we had together from Halloween, I DONT THINK I'm being overdramatic by feeling this way, it really hurt my feelings because that's literally the only video she's deleted online. So I'm asking myself there's no possible good reason she'd do that if things were alright between us. But I don't know how to bring it up without sounding crazy, because I can see a million different people saying \"it's just a post, you sound really needy and over-invested/overthinking, and you're smothering her\" but like dude... What else could I interpret from her leaving exes on her social media from the year prior and the I'm the only one she deleted. I really don't feel like I'm overthinking, I feel like I have very justified hurt from this one, but I'm more than welcoming for a different perspective. So it's rocky, she's just given me too many red flags man. It's really hurt my feelings. \n\nI also really need to emphasize I don't vocalize these things passively or anything, I keep them to myself, so I know it's not me pushing her away with that. I owe myself the grace of voicing my strengths, and I've been honestly doing a fantastic job at being a good boyfriend, I've helped her in all I could, made her feel seen and heard, done the things she expressed she needs and genuinely been there for her. So like I'm just struggling with the video deletion right now, among some other pretty hateful things she blew up at me 2 weeks ago over. She just did a total 180 and said\n\n\".........I'm not saying that I never want to see you again, but I am saying that I need a serious back-down. The more you profess your feelings for me, the more it feels unhealthy and unattractive to me. I apologize if I am being too blunt, I don't mean it in a way to be harmful however I've realized when I'm not blunt with people, they don't respect my wishes. So I'm explaining it to you as best and as clearly as I can...... \"\n\n\" .....I understand the way you show affection. I understand that you need more in a relationship. But at the end of the day, I am the complete opposite and when I need space I need space .......\"\n\nYou have to understand that we've been reciprocating the exact same level of feedback to each other the entire time we've been talking. I was not being any different or anything from her and I was the affirmation she was saying she wanted and needed and I was getting that exact same level back. This is a site of Internet strangers, and I have no reason whatsoever to pull the rug over anyone's eyes to make myself look like the good-guy for 1-2 karma, I genuinely am giving the objective facts on this one.. it just feels like I'm convenient for her right now, and the biggest thing is I've had this 180 happen so many times in the past, I just didn't see this one coming because she was absolutely reciprocating and not only telling me but SHOWING me that was her language in a relationship too. So I just feel bamboozled at this point. And I lost almost all my trust in this to a certain extent. \n\n\n\nAll that shit aside, I'm much better mentally, I know what I have to work on, and Im starting to learn what I actually need to look out for next time I'm in a relationship. I'm still very sad but not as bitter, I've found myself happiness in some new ways like running and I'm learning to form and Express my own thoughs and emotions for things in this stage of my life. Almost 34 and still at square one, alone for this Thanksgiving and Christmas all over again, so nothing new, 14 years strong baybeee! Lol probably just get Taco Bell and do a little half-marathon. Need to pick up a hobby and find joy in something I think. And I'm on a waiting list for a therapist but 10 weeks is so long I hate that it takes this long, but that's showbiz I guess.",

I cry and ask God and the universe what did I do to deserve this pain and despair..\n\nThere's a lot to go into but speaking from someone who can totally relate to everything you said, as I've been repeatedly ghosted betrayed, in my final analysis after meditating for a long time I've come to realise it's all about energy. If you do the inner work and meditate it's not about what you did or not, it's the fact that the world is a mirror reflecting back our feelings of worthlessness. This can change with a lot of therapy, conditioning the subconsciousness and self work. I don't know if this is you but did you have profound childhood trauma? A lot of our experiences later in life gets fucked up due to unresolved wounds from our past. I don't want you to think I'm preaching some weird bogus magical spiritual ideas here, but it's truly the absolute truth. I've come across quotes that I've been repeating to myself to try to get through this \n\n'where there is no enemy within, there can be no enemy outside'\n\n'if you betray yourself, you are no better than others who have also betrayed you'\n\nWhen we chase after repeated painful experiences, unavailable people, circumstances time and again it's time to rewire the subconsciousness to wonder just why is this happening to target the root. This isn't about taking self blame but I've not found any other way to change this because trying to manipulate our external world to get people to give us what we want will only rob us of our energy and won't cure it. Energy will just move on to attracting the same type of garbage again and again, that's what's happened with me no matter how much I tried to escape it.\n\nIf you repeatedly have experiences attracting the same type of disappointments and people into your life there's a pattern that is a red flag indicating what must change. We can't forcefully change anyone else but we can only control how we respond to it . I can certainly see how that woman's words triggered you, but at the same time as hard as it is I would try to feel grateful to hear it as she seems to be honest compared to most who would just ghost or block you long before that point. I think she's giving you a solidified sign, regardless of how she pretended to act around you that she does not care for you the way you care for her. Send her on her way and release her to the universe and if it's meant to be she may return but likely someone/something better. \n\nThe next step for me is death at this point if I don't find a way out of my own hell and it's not the first time I've been suicidal, although I don't have the greatest advice for you, I want to share things I've been watching and doing to cope which may help you get through even if it's 1 percent better than nothing..\n\nhttps://www.mind-your-reality.com/index.html\n\nRead every single article here repeatedly, I even ordered a book from her, it's one of the greatest things I ever read. The cause of all emotional suffering comes from attachment and our ego, and to our external world.

            "comment": "28M here and the answer is yes and no. I'm single right now and I'm enjoying it. Let me explain. Firstly I disagree with what you said about \"moving from a relationship to another\" because I can't do that really. It's because I look for meaningful long term relationships and moving to another after a break-up would be detrimental for you as you would have certain expectations still lingering from your last partner and on the partners side which will feel unfit and frustrated. That's kinda using someone. NOW! There are 2 things you want to consider. There are things you cannot do as much in a relationship so try  and enjoy your freedom, which turns into the second thing... Doing what you want is also investing in yourself, so you see and understand your own value. What you bring to the table. Put yourself out there and let people know how valuable you really are. I've been in long relationships and all ended being toxic and/or got cheated on. I miss having someone there and cuddling, but God I love having the freedom to be myself and not stressing every damn day and not walking on eggshells everytime I want to say anything at all. Enjoy your freedom, learn to love yourself and be happy in your single life and when choosing a partner be careful that it is someone who really loves and appreciates you for everything that you are. Don't settle for someone just for having a relationship. You'll only get hurt.",

Then the whole \"love yourself\" and \"it'll come when you least expect it\" platitudes get thrown my way, then I feel guilty for not \"loving myself\" enough.  And it's a horrible cycle of fear, anger, hate, and suffering as Yoda would say.  And it's all in my head.\n\nPeople want to belong, to feel loved, to have warmth and security, to have sex, to be cared for and also do those same things for others!  Without them, life feels a bit wobbly and off balance, like a big part of a happy life is denied to you, no matter the effort put forth.  YES, I know I can volunteer, and have friends and hobbies and be okay alone...but it's just that, okay.  In a society that promotes love and sex so much in all forms of media and that celebrates weddings as the \"biggest day\" of your life...it's all a lot of pressure from internal and external sources.  Combine that with the ticking clock of age and death, and there's only so much time you have to find someone.\n\nIt's not easy nor fun when things don't go according to your wishes and life expectations, especially when what seems like nearly everyone around you is in a committed long-term relationship.  This gets even more glaring around age 30 as couples move in together and get married.  It's not a fun emotion to feel envious of others.  I want everyone to fall in love and be happy with their situation, but it's just not reality.  Material things, careers, education, relocating can all be achieved through hard work and determination.  If you REALLY want them, you can make a lot of it happen.  Love, however, is largely out of our control.  It involves timing, luck, attraction, availability, and someone else's feelings for you.  It's just rather unfortunate that most of us here in this subreddit are left behind in the romance arena.\n\nThat's why it can feel triggering to see happy couples.  They remind of us of what we don't have, what we can't control, and what we want.",

This is the problem with people, they get jealous and bitter abt dumb shit like this and become complacent. They think \u201cit\u2019ll never happen\u201d and it\u2019s the only thing they think about to the point one dude even said he\u2019s stopped going outside. ..what? Are you a child? Why are you living for the idea of someone else\u2019s love. Frequently, when you ask what kind of person these people want, they want somebody who will bend to their every whim, only ever doing thing they want to. That\u2019s clearly not how a functional relationship works, it\u2019s commitment, it\u2019s a partnership, there are tradeoffs, it won\u2019t always be good. Put yourself out there, literally do anything, live for yourself, and love yourself, because you can\u2019t be in a relationship without doing that first. If you can\u2019t love yourself, who\u2019s gonna love you? The only person you\u2019re guaranteed to be with for the rest of your life is you, so work on that person, enjoy your own company.  Once you have that, nobody can take it away from you, and once you\u2019ve got your shit settled, people will tend to gravitate toward you. Guess what, nobody wants the toxic victim who\u2019s irresponsible for their actions and makes poor life choices. No offense, but OP\u2019s jealous about somebody being happy? Shame.",

He's 3 years younger than me and has had more relationships than I will likely ever have. And my 5 year younger sibling is polyamorous with their current SO. Even my parents kind of make me sad that I'll never have anything remotely close to their level of commitment and understanding. And I'll be spending Christmas with all of them...very difficult to keep the mask of joy up during this time.",

For me, I no longer ask \"why doesn't anyone love me?\" Everyone's greatest desire is to be loved; few people actually feel unconditionally loved. \n\nInstead, I focus on making those feel loved so that they may return that love. Maybe they won't, expect that to happen. But if you do this, you'll find many wanting your company; who would want to be around a depressive mess all the time (me)? I know I wouldn't wanna be close friends with someone who's constantly negative about himself/herself. So, I strive to be more lighthearted, humorous and uplifting. I encourage you to value yourself as a continual work in progress. You don't have to love who you are now; love who you will be. Love the values you maintain, and spread that confidence to others. :)",

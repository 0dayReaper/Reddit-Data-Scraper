But the only reason we are/can be like that is because we were deprived of real human connection and attention. So like when we do ever experience this phenomenon it\u2019s insane and feels good. And we just want to hold onto it as long as possible before it goes away and we have to go back to being an unnoticed, unappreciated, and ghost of a human being.",

It really wasnt a relationship dont even know why I thought of it like that but well to put a long story short I was pretty much just a dare. Her friends dared her to ask me out and well I was rather happy about it because I thought she really liked me and when I found out I was only trash to her I simply gave up on making friends or trying to establish any relationship at all albeit friends or girlfriends. It started to interfere with my school work and because I wouldn't want to work with anyone which then resulted in an instant f for that specific assignment. I ended up dropping out of highschool really early and pretty much just live out my days alone and in peace.",

When you literally have no friends and have never known what it\u2019s like for a guy to hit on you in any way, shape, or form, you kind of end up letting your guard down around people you really shouldn\u2019t let your guard down around all because they complimented you once. I remember I let the school fuck boy flirt with me and I flirted back convinced he must like me cause why else would he flirt? I didn\u2019t have any friends so I didn\u2019t know he was the school fuck boy and I remember how fucking hard I fell when he told me he was fucking around with me and that I meant nothing. Him and his friends would point and laugh at me after that every time they saw me which didn\u2019t help my reputation. But, anyway, that was all in high school and I can safely say I\u2019m definitely more wary in college but damn why do I still let any guy catch me off guard? Why do I end up falling in love or making myself their mom and looking after them for them? Why do I tell them it\u2019s okay to rely on me for shit when it\u2019s not? I never let girls take advantage of me like that but I guess if you\u2019re even a semi decently looking/acting guy you have my entire heart.",

Its my first post/comment on reddit and i just felt like letting out some steam.\n\nBeen feeling this way for a couple of years now but have only just recently noticed it. Been bullied from year 1 to 6 and had some friends in 7th to 9th grade. Back then i used to still feel happy even when shit went wrong, i didnt think much of it. Now im 19 and i feel like its all hitting me at once.\n\nWhen someone shows me any sort of attention of simpathy i imidietaly start dedicating my time towards helping when whenever they need help. Not in a simp way but more as in being a decent human being and listening to what they have to say when they have something to say. I end up putting people ahead of me in hopes that the feeling of appreciation will follow along with the process.\n\nEventually i feel like they start to see me as an idiot and really only come to me when they need help.\n\nI used to have a decent amount of friends but that has gone down to approximately 0 now. Atleast people that i can open up to or see as a \"close friend\". Only person in my life rn is a girl that has rejected me about a year ago and ended up falling in love with one of my friends that i introduced to her. Their relationship isnt working out and ive been helping her all the way through it becasue nothing in this world makes me happier than to see her smile.\n\nShit is fucking pathetic.",

It makes me feel awkward and irritated.. it's sad but I've come to accept being lonely and alone so much that Its home now. Ive never known anything other than being alone so being treated like anything nevermind human feels weird to me. Not like I don't deserve it but, if you keep trying to shine light in my solitary hole you'll wanna join me, and then one day your gonna find I've left, and your gonna hate me. Because now being alone is all I known and now I find it impossible to be with people. So i guess it's closer to people treat me nice, I feel irritated that they're treating me nicely and not neutrally ignoring me and then realize how far I've fallen from society that the idea of having friends or a relationship sounds.. awful.. I'm loneliest when people want me because It reminds me of why I'm better off alone (mental health reasons, I'm happier without people and I kinda wish I was normal)",

We, i want sex of course and if I get a beautiful woman in process i will be happy and i can settle. But it is not a one sided coin you are aiming for a lot better men than are available. And in the world is little bit more men than women so you get the pick. You say if i will be in relationship depending on my presentation of myself. So o want to say of are you unhappy with my characteristics please just say so. Maybe so other man will have okay. Just remember to be realistic. And i hope ot is comprehensible. I am not offering a lot in the relationship but i try to aim at similar and reasonable offers from women. But i get rejections. Maybe the are justified maybe not.

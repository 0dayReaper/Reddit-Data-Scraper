    "postText": "I'm 23/M, I spend almost all of my free time on art. Sure it's cliche to be the \"tortured artist\" type but hey, it's cliche for a reason lol. I really don't play video games besides retro, pre-2010 stuff, I don't actively seek out modern movies - I don't even have tiktok. I just don't really have an interest in keeping with the times, I guess. Of course, I've found online friends who enjoy the arts and my other odd interests, but it is hard as someone in the lower middle class because everyone surroundimg me just cannot relate, at all. i dont dislike them for it but it obviously prevents friendships from getting very relatable, and it is very isolating. I feel crazy. I wish I knew where to find people with anything in common with me. Does anyone have advice?",

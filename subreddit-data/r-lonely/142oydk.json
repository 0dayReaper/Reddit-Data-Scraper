Most days i don't think much about it and have accepted and tried to move on but oh boy somedays are so so hard that i can't even tell you guys. I literally feel physical pain.It feels so lonely and so hard to accept that that person doesn't love you.\nWhat's your coping mechanism to it?",

(She rejected me and I didn\u2019t try anymore) Just felt like as long as I can be by her side that\u2019s all it matter. Looking back at it I regretted for falling in love with her and wasted all those time knowing I will never ever get her",

    "postText": "I\u2019m 25, never been in a serious relationship, no college degree, currently unemployed, and living in my dead grandfather\u2019s house. \nI haven\u2019t been unemployed long, I have worked the last 5 years with much success achieving the title of engineer without any diploma. I made well above my friends and colleagues my age and was certain of longevity and success. \nI don\u2019t have a significant other and never have. It was never an issue that bothered me as I didn\u2019t need that type of love to lean on. \nIt has now occurred to me that (maybe the frontal lobe completing development?) without a woman to start a family and begin creating a legacy, what is all this for? What is working 90-100 hours a week 1000+ miles from home all for? I don\u2019t need that! \u2014if it\u2019s just me! \nWorking in the oil/gas industry, there aren\u2019t a lot of what I\u2019d say are \u201cmother-of-your-child\u201d material women, if any at all, in these work environments or locals. So, I\u2019ve spent the prime of my adult-youth on the road and away from females my age. \nWithout that equal part, I feel incomplete and without purpose. Achieving a high salary job and the prestige within a company that joins it, now seems pointless\u2026\nI can\u2019t end it. I know what that would do to my mother and father, a few friends and extended family as well. \nEither it will appear as accidental or it\u2019ll wait until they\u2019ve passed. \nI truly can\u2019t believe this is what my life has come to, I was born with so many advantages that probably 95% of the world aren\u2019t offered. I hope that ending yourself doesn\u2019t keep you out of heaven. That\u2019s another deterrent I\u2019m not sure what I believe on. \nI so so so wish I could go back just a few years and change a couple things. I feel like just after you\u2019ve started a new level in a video game and lost most of your \u201clives.\u201d Like, what\u2019s the point in finishing now? What a waste of an attempt. That\u2019s my story rn.",

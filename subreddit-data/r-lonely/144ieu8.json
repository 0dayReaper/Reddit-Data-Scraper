    "postText": "It's been more than a year since I realised that besides my family I have no one. Ever since then it feels like everything's been falling apart. I am hardly passing in school which I used to love. Engineering used to be everything for me and now I don't want to do anything. I am being more and more overwhelmed by feeling alone. I'm having the urges to harm myself. \n\nIt all got to a point where I realised that there's something wrong with me, I was diagnosed with severe depression and eventually put in the hospital for nearly 5 weeks. They changed my medication, I was released few weeks ago but it has gotten exactly where it was before or even worse.\n\nI hate living this life.",

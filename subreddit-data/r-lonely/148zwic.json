    "postText": "This is my first ever posting something in this sub because I want to take some action to fight my loneliness.  \nLong story short, It's been three years since I started feeling extremely lonely. Ever since graduating from high school, I have been feeling as if I am an alien, outcasted, so different from other people. All of my childhood friends are no longer in contact with me because we grew up and had different values and opinions which made us departed in a different direction. Since then, I was focusing on myself and studies, but this lingering feeling of loneliness and sadness never seem to fade away. Each and every day it gets worse. After watching and reading tons of lectures and articles about curing my depression, I thought it worth trying to reach out people experiencing the same issue as me.  \n\n\nI wanna join group chats or discord any sort of platform that I connect with people who share similar experience as me.  \nAnyone who is interested in building a meaningful friendship, please send a DM  \nLet's be friends",

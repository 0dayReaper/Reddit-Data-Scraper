    "postText": "About 2 weeks ago I tried Tinder and Bumble and even paid on both apps to get more matches but I only got a few and only one match replied back to me. Today we went out on a date. We went for tea and then for a walk, when we were done walking I walked her back to her car and asked if she\u2019s down to do this again. She said yeah. She texted me when she got home so I know she meant it. She wants me to plan a second date but in the meantime I\u2019m happy as I\u2019m writing this.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your support! I feel a little less lonely and much more hopeful for the future. I wish anyone out there on the same boat as me good luck.",

The local stores always have people that are willing to be friendly though there are assholes ngl but lots of positives. People on the subreddits are pretty helpful to newcomers. You can try the yugioh master duel app for free on pretty much all consoles to see if you like it. I recommend the store Gaming Universe in Flushing NY. Hope you find some people to hang out with wherever tho.",

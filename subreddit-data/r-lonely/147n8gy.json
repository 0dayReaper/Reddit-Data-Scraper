    "postText": "I'm male (20 years old) and I literally swipe every day on dating apps (tinder mostly) and I get no matches (I sometimes get 1 or 2 matches but it's rare) and when I do get 1 or 2 matches, most of the time I get no responses or I get ghosted after texting for a bit or I have the girl act so rude and pretty much mock me.\n\nI litterly swipe like on every girl\n\nI have tried everything from making effort into my profile and the profile pictures I use to how I type when I get a match and still nothing\n\nBut anyway I don't get why I should have to put effort into my profile when women also don't put effort into theirs and also there's some guys who get tons of matches even though they don't put any effort into their pictures or/and profile and the fact that men usually are the ones who plan the date and women don't do anything except just show up and most of the time the man pays for the date and is expected to pay for the date by the women",

Mass Swiping is sometimes a sign of low selectivity or potential spam behavior, so you could try to... Be more selective... Sometimes it works, is the easiest way of finding new people there.",

            "comment": "Swiping on everyone everyday puts you in \"garbage category\" on Tinder. After that, your profile stays there and it forces you to buy in (don't).\n\nLiterally the best thing you can do is to make a new account, because this one is lost.\n\nSecondly, as a guy, put effort into your account. It's a place where women choose. You're like a package on store shelf. You need to stand out. Talking about your pictures, bio and preferences.\n\nAldo, for first week your profile is highlighted and you get more matches, you're visible to more women.\n\nAlso, swipe on weekend. When people are at home bored. You get bigger pool of real people. Also swipe only (or mostly) on people that are online, same reason, bigger chance for interaction.\n\nNext really evaluate who you swipe on. Most of the girls with perfect photography shoot-like phoyos with no bio are a dead cause.\n\n**CHOOSE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR**. If you want just quick fuck then you better be a model and be an asshole. If you want a relationship, be genuine and look for women that want the same.\n\nLastly, expect to fail. Tinder is too saturated with other people and if you are low confidence guy, are not good looking or not interesting and you know it. Don't use it. It'll just be painful to you.\n\nBest of luck",

I'm pointing out how if you get girls or a girl (which you don't) then you wouldn't be on Reddit lmao especially this Reddit lmao. The internet is full of bullshitters like you. Just admit it you ain't special and stop being pathetic and putting words in others mouths and then pretending that you are an alpha lmao",

Your success begins and ends with how often someone sees your profile, and that\u2019s algorithm-based.  If no one sees it, then we don\u2019t even have the option to swipe right or left on you.\n\nAlso, what a shitty attitude to have about putting your best foot forward for something that\u2019s important to you.  What does it matter if someone isn\u2019t doing their best?  Why do you feel not doing yours is a viable option?  You should always want to give it your best.",

Some apps are all about making you pay to see your matches or even reply.  I\u2019m dreaming if I think I\u2019m gonna get anywhere on Feeld. It\u2019s a waste of time, you\u2019re right OP.",

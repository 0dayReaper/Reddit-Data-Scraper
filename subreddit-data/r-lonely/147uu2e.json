    "postText": "Honestly i\u2019m so over having crushes on people and trying to be friends with people.It actually sucks cause i feel like i put forward the effort for everything.I\u2019m just so over it,tired of explaining myself too.I feel like sometimes people treat me so trash is because they know i\u2019ll be there when they wanna talk. I just hate when people can\u2019t see when they are hurting me or they do and don\u2019t care. I wish i could stop caring for a minute just to give my mind and brain a break. Feeling like a burden to people just sucks because when i get ignored i just take it  but i\u2019ll never do that to them. Like recently i\u2019ve been having a hard time cause a death anniversary of my uncle is coming up and i told two people how negatively it\u2019s been hurting me and it\u2019s like they cared cause i said something but nobody has checked on me since. I\u2019m just so over people.",

Try to flip the script and observe the changes, I'm pretty sure that you'll be surprised by how unnecessarily cruel we can be towards ourselves.",

            "comment": "I am going to reference star wars here, but \"Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.\" - Yoda. You are already at anger and potentially at hate. If you continue to view men in this way you will almost certainly suffer for it. \n\nAlso, there is another quote \"To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering.\" - Friedrich Nietzsche. Find meaning in your suffering if you can. You love so you accept that imperfection in yourself and in others. Suffering is part of any achievement, whether that be studying to know the answers or caring about those who've hurt you to continue to receive love.",

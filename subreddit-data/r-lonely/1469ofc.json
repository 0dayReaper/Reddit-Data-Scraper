And then there are people like me, with disabilities or they just have a hard time connecting to people etc. etc. Why is the world that way, I just don't get it. Sometimes I don't feel like it is even worth fighting for a life less lonely.",

Likely a rather naive view to have, but if there\u2019s one choice we truly have, it\u2019s how we choose to perceive the world, ourselves and everyone in it. How much you allow the perceptions of others to adjust your perception is ultimately up to you.\n\nLife is precious in all it\u2019s forms, just think of everything that had to happen in order for you to exist right now. So yes, keep fighting!",

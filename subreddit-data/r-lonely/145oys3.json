    "postText": "Hi,\n\nSo I\u2019ve been quite lonely for nearly 4 years now. I have a couple of friends, but I rarely see them as they don\u2019t live too close to me. For the last few years, I\u2019ve been going weeks on end without receiving texts, snaps, or dms from people outside of my family. At first this was very challenging for me. I\u2019d regularly check my phone every 10 mins and nothing. Now it doesn\u2019t bother me much.\n\nThis brings me to my question. Has anyone else here got past the loneliness? As if you\u2019re desensitized to it? Dr. K (a psychiatrist, from Healthy Gamers) compared loneliness to hunger or thirst. Where at first your body will ask you to socialize, but when you ignore it, your body eventually stops asking. \n\nI\u2019ve found this to be relatable, and now I\u2019m wondering if others can relate as well. \n\nNote: I don\u2019t mean for this to come across as rude or like I feel I\u2019ve ascended above lonely people. Realistically, I\u2019m still lonely, but I just dont hurt as much as I used to. I\u2019m looking to hear other cases out of curiosity, not to hit y\u2019all with the weirdest flex in existence.\n\nThank ya.",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t know who Dr. K is. \n\nI think what helped me and what might help you too is not being so guarded around your phone. I didn\u2019t realize how much attention I was putting towards only my phone expecting a notif from my friends.\n\nEven if your friend did send you a message, realistically do you really need to reply straight away? Loosen up a little and fuel what you could even call an addiction.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nI don\u2019t expect notifs from my pals anymore unfortunately. We\u2019re all doing what\u2019s best for our lives. But, the thought of them bettering their lives is enough for me to be happy. The thought of them pushing on without me makes me happy. \n\nEven though I am still kinda lonely? I do like my own company! There\u2019s this huge field that I\u2019ve explored recently and I\u2019ve just been laying down embracing life. Even though I wish I could have gone with my friends or girlfriend, I find it peaceful having time for myself by myself. It\u2019s a certain kind of feeling that you can\u2019t get anywhere else. \n\nBasically what I\u2019m trying to say is, ignore your phone, enjoy your company. You will always meet new people but you have to be discoverable.",

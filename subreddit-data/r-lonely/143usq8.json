    "postText": "I (23m) have a good amount of online friends. Now, that would normally be enough for me but as time went on\u2026 Well. I just don\u2019t hear from them. I only have one friend who regularly reaches out to me and wants me to play games. I appreciate that but I yearn for something deeper than just games. I want someone who I can talk to about my passions, who I can cry to when I feel like a disappointment, maybe sit there in a call and watch shows or even do our own separate things together. I wish I had a lover, but unfortunately I\u2019m in a spot where I don\u2019t fetch a pretty penny in this market. So now here I am, looking around seeing where my friends are, they hang out together on social platforms and such, I could join them. But.. There isn\u2019t a particular \u201cwant\u201d for me. No one really cares whether I\u2019m around, let alone notices when I\u2019m not. I reached out to an old friend recently, I\u2019ve cared a lot about them over the years and we are always in and out of communication, but they don\u2019t seem like they actually want me around. It\u2019s a bummer because we would always say how we\u2019ve known each-other for so long. I guess that doesn\u2019t really mean much. Well, what I\u2019m trying to say is, people will let you know when they want you around, you will know when you are wanted. And I just.. I just\u2026 I really just don\u2019t think that\u2019s happened many times in my life outside of middle school.. I don\u2019t know what to do and honestly I just want to make a friend that I can sit with, even if it\u2019s online. Someone who will actually want me in their life when I don\u2019t even want to be in my own. Anyways, sorry for the really long post. I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m hoping for here but I guess it\u2019s better to throw this into the void than to sit with these feelings weighing on my heart.",

    "postText": "Been working through a breakup that happened back in October that completely destroyed me, most of my friends have stopped talking to me for one reason or another, work leaves me physically exhausted and I currently don\u2019t have my own vehicle so I rarely leave the house. The one friend I do have lives almost an hour away from me and he\u2019s going through his own shit in life so he rarely answers the phone. I feel like even when I do interact with people I can tell that they really don\u2019t care if I\u2019m around or not. I\u2019m so tired of it. I miss waking up next to someone, having someone who I at least thought loved me, I miss having like minded friends who were always there for me if I needed it. My therapist was my only friend for a while but the cost of sessions isn\u2019t sustainable for me anymore so I literally can\u2019t even pay someone to give a shit. I don\u2019t know what to do at this point aside from just accepting that I\u2019m gonna be alone. Dating in this age range is garbage and I\u2019ve never approached anyone before because I\u2019m so fucking afraid of just being laughed at. Long story short, I\u2019m fuckin done, I\u2019m over it. Fuck love",

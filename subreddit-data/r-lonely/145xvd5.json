    "postText": "I fucking hate this. \n\nI have lost all my friends over the past year and a half due to a variety of reasons including physical distance, difference in life outlook, career paths, etc. I\u2019m in a small town rn (new environment) and extremely lonely, not just in a relationship sense, but for friendship. \n\nMy dating pool is very small here (lesbian). I don\u2019t have my own car at the moment, so I can\u2019t really go to many places. I have no in-person friends here because I don\u2019t know anyone my age, let alone anyone whom I share interests with. No online friends besides one girl I know from college that I very occasionally message, more of an acquaintance really. \n\nSomeone reached out to me via Reddit two weeks ago and offered me an invite to a Discord server for gay women and I was over the fucking moon. It was fantastic; I was able to connect with people on a variety of topics, post my art, even voice chat (I barely speak to anyone besides one family member that lives nearby). \n\nLast night I found a funny video that I wanted to share with one of the chat channels, opened up Discord, and saw that I had been removed. I was so shocked I genuinely thought it was a glitch. Just the night before we were talking and chatting like normal. I wasn\u2019t able to message anyone, even those I\u2019d messaged outside the server. \n\nI finally got through to one of the members and she said she had no idea what had happened and reached out to the mod for me. Finally got a message on Reddit from the girl who originally invited me (mod) that she\u2019d \u201chad a couple complaints\u201d about me and therefore removed me. No explanation, nothing. I genuinely have no idea what I could have done. Spent my morning sobbing. \n\nI wish I\u2019d never even responded to the invite. I was used to being alone, having no friends. This feels like absolute shit. Now I remember what it feels like to have friends, and it got ripped away with no explanation in under 2 weeks. I wish I\u2019d never tried to make friends again. \n\nI still don\u2019t know why I got booted or what happened. I never broke any of their rules or spoke disrespectfully to any other members. One day I was in, next I was out. No explanation given. That\u2019s what hurts the most, and I\u2019m horrified that I could have done anything to make someone else uncomfortable/upset in any way. I just want to know what I did wrong.\n\nI wish I could forget what it feels like to have friends again. It was better that way.",

On the other hand.. if they're the type to just boot you without proper reason.. maybe they weren't that great after all. \n\nSee if they can give you an actual response and if not, as difficult as it sounds right now, try and forget and move on because they weren't worthy of you to begin with and hopefully you meet some great people next.",

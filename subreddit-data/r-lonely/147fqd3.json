    "postText": "Any time I find a woman I like and move to make plans with her, she flakes out every time. It is one of the most repeatedly disheartening truths I have ever had to deal with.\n\nBut the strip club, those dancers will always be there for you. Get stood up on a date? Just head to the club. A girl may never be reliable or accountable when it comes to you but if they need to make money, they will show up at that club and if you enter as a customer, they will entertain you.\n\nIt's really just a tiny morsel of the affection and human connection most of us should get to experience, but it's still better and more reliable than what most of us are actually getting these days.\n\nI was hoping by quitting and trying to get my life together, I could become a changed person, have new experiences with real women, become worthy of somebody's time and energy for once. But all this seems to be doing is reminding me why I got hooked on strippers in the first place. Apparently that is all I am worth.\n\nI will stay the course for the rest of the year and take each emotional hit in passing until I am an absolute empty shell of a human or until next year, whichever comes first. By that point, I should have enough money saved up to buy all the affection I'll never be able to earn the old fashioned way, at least for a little while.\n\nI will try to improve but deep down until someone proves me wrong, I will forever just remain stuck in this never-good-enough loop in my mind. At least with the strip club I can take brief breaks from misery for a little bit of relief and the temporary comfort of thinking you've connected with someone you think you like, maybe even getting a make out sesh in the lap dance room. Yeah, I know some think it's gross. Yeah I know some think it's pathetic. Don't care anymore. Better than nothing. Gives me some peace of mind. Oh how I miss that.\n\nNow when a woman makes plans w me and inevitably lets me down, I have taken away my only outlet that had any success rate to actually making me feel any better. I stopped going hoping to improve my life but did it really? I feel that same sense of choked-out emptiness I felt in HS or college when I was getting rejected left and right by every single woman and couldn't just go blow off steam at the club. \n\nSave me from the nothing I've become. If you think there is a better alternative that involves actually connecting with a woman who will actually flirt with me, touch me, kiss me, make me feel wanted, please let me know. Not sure how much longer I can hold out.",

And it\u2019s a difficult job because of how unethical it can be. Make friends. Talk to the friends you already have. See a therapist. But to live in the fantasy of that world is unhealthy.",

I am seeing a therapist and I do have a good support system of friends and they all know what my deal is. But I don't think any amount of therapy will heal those battle scars the way a woman's touch will.",

You shouldn\u2019t objectify or put them on a pedestal. They can\u2019t heal you. You expecting that from them is setting yourself up for failure.",

I have experienced this in the past, just very rarely. I don't think anything has ever healed me faster or more efficiently than the touch of the right girl, and I have dated one or two women where I felt like I healed her. I think this is one of the beautiful things of dating. So I disagree with you there.",

But certain situations and aspects from dealing with strippers has healed me somewhat and kept me sane, gave me an outlet when I would have otherwise had none. Nothing else has helped me as much as that even if the help I got still hasn't completely fixed me either. I've hated strippers, had one fall in love with me, I met her mom, slept over her house often. Had another stripper who I fell in love with, also met her family, dated her for years, she still insisted on keeping me a secret from everybody which was toxic and red flag as all hell but those moments I felt loved by her are truly the highlight of my life.\n\nDid I use it as a crutch too? Sure, but I needed a crutch in the worst way possible and thank God it was there for me.",

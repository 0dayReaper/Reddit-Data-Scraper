    "postText": "I am m21 and I just cannot make friends outside of online through discord.\n\nI am going into my junior year of college and between the past two years at college (1 at a 40k student university in 2020 then a gap year then transfer to a 2k student one) I have been unable to make any friends. Granted 2020 was COVID made those years a bit harder but walking around campus everyone including my roommate seemed to have a friend group. Wether through lab groups or anything I just find it impossible to socialize and make a friend. Writing this seems so stupid because it is just my fault. I could probably approach some people and become friends but I just don\u2019t. I don\u2019t really have much confidence in my self and I feel it impossible to start up and maintain conversations with people and just feel so lonely definitely at school. I am at home right now for the summer and thankfully have a very supporting family but still doesn\u2019t change the fact that I cannot make friends irl. As I said I somehow can make friends and socialize somewhat normally over discord but it just doesn\u2019t really fill the void of loneliness at school and it just isn\u2019t the same. It also makes school work just harder because a lot of the homework given is given in the thought that you will work on it together with other people helping each other figure stuff out. The worst part is I don\u2019t even know what I would do if I had friends. I just want to play video games and get my work done so it would be better if I didn\u2019t have friends but for some reason that doesn\u2019t stop the lonely feeling. It might just be the social stigma I guess that you should have friends infused into me but I would most likely be a really bad friend if I were even capable of making one. \n\nI just really don\u2019t know what to do. Also am I just unapproachable or put off an off putting demeanor. It seems like people avoid me, my hygiene is fine I use deodorant, shower, and brush my teeth and I know I need to take initiative if I want to make friends but it seems like people just avoid me. I know I will be alone for my life so I should just accept it but it just always nags at me and I just want to be able to accept that fact completely. I shouldn\u2019t need to conform to social standards and make friend but I just feel lonely. I spend all my time in my room at school only going out for class and food. I sometimes eat in the cafe but always sit alone of course. I currently am doing work as a door dash driver as there is basically no human confrontation or socialization (although does pay pretty well been making around 20 and hour and can work on my own time). Like I said I just need to accept I will always be alone but is that even a viable life. I mean I will always have friends online but living a life online seems like a superficial life. And by online I don\u2019t really use social media much at all (snap, insta, etc). I don\u2019t even know why I am on Reddit I barely use it. I only have one other post that dives a lot deeper into my loneliness but I just want advice. I need to be able to communicate with people better if I ever want a job or to be successful in life and I am just incapable it feels. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for wasting y\u2019all\u2019s time reading through this junk but I just want to know what I can do or if this is just how it will be or if people have dealt this way as well. I\u2019m just stuck and can\u2019t decide how to move forward with this. Should I try to make friends and let people down/be a bad friend or just suck it up and finally fully accept I\u2019ll be alone.",

When you get a good body it will be not possible not to notice you.\n3. Choose good clothes.\n4. Get more self confidence and develop socializing skills. Women always like guys who have good sense of humor and who can keep the conversation.",

But it is not that hard to improve the look, you just need to put some effort. I am not super handsome, but I did a lot of job to look good and improve myself.",

    "postText": "i was with her for 25 months. Around 3am 1 year ago, i kicked her out of my house cuz i caught her cheating thru her text messages. \nI dont know if I\u2019m over it or not because i personally do not care for her, I just wish I could have the women thats right for me. Ever since that whole incident, my mentality has fortified, standards arose, and my whole mentality and way of thinking has gotten better. It\u2019s just been harder trying to find someone who meets my standards (which honestly isnt crazy; bare minimum)\n\nI\u2019m tired of feeling depressed and down every other day because I dont have a girlfriend. I feel empty, a void waiting to be filled. Yeah focus on myself get money etc etc I know but it doesnt change the fact that I want what I once felt and had\u2026 I dont chase anymore because many people I speak thru these dating apps arent intriguing enough to carry on with but I just felt like it was so much easier back then\u2026 to talk, to relate, to connect with a girl. Majority of them I talk to are delusional as fuck and just wanna whore around (I dont mean to generalize, Im 23 and I talk to a lot of younger 18+ girls that just arent on my maturity/mental level)\n\n\nSo yeah, I dont really miss the person, just the feeling. But i feel hopeless in getting what I want. I do believe its Gods intention to keep me single and make me focus on better things. But I cant help but feel numb, depressed, very lonely every single day\u2026\n\nThank you for reading, I just wanted to vent and let this out. There is no answer I am seeking.",

It sucks to say man but there is reasons to live, and unfortunately, it\u2019s looking at the bright side of the coin\u2026which I can empathize at times is seemingly impossible. I think the most powerful thing, in my experience, because I don\u2019t want to down play or coach ya, is recognize I was the toxicity. You can be the toxicity to your own emotions sometimes, you can\u2019t point fingers at happiness and call it toxic when it\u2019s you or me or others who are struggling to grasp the concept on a sustained level of happiness and security. I hope things improve, but having a PMA can truly trick your brain..even for a moment, that things are okay and will be okay. I hope you are able to string a couple of those moments together dude, you ain\u2019t alone!",

And your fights with yourself is getting old. Deep down in that buried skull you really, really want to come out of that hole you dug yourself. We can only do so much helping, maybe throw you a ladder or something, but you gotta climb. You gotta climb it real high cause life is hard and every inch makes a mile. You might notice others have it real worse, maybe you\u2019ll want to someday help them instead. Cause that ladder you climbed, its sturdy enough to be reused for the next hole you find.",

    "postText": "Why can\u2019t anyone just notice me. I go through life day in and day out like a background characters in the lives of others. I have a wife who wouldn\u2019t notice if I shoved a grenade in my mouth and pulled the pin as long as her reality tv is on, coworkers legit tell me certain say \u201cI didn\u2019t even know you were here\u201d, friends don\u2019t text don\u2019t call unless I reach out first. I crave connection human interaction. Starting to feel that I need to become a villain or become this person I don\u2019t want to be just for someone to notice me. Fuck this life fuck this world. The void is finally taking control of me.",

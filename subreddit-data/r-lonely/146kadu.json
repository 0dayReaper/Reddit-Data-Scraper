    "postText": "25M here. I\u2019m just struggling with a lot right now. I haven\u2019t really started dating in my life and I have no idea what it will even look like. I don\u2019t know what women look for, and I have female friends, but they are very picky when it comes to relationships which I think is why I\u2019ve been a bit afraid of dating. By the end of my education, I could have 50k in student/medical debt to pay off, and I\u2019m worried about that being a huge factor that will keep me alone forever. Like it freaks me out so bad that it makes me want to give up on my dreams just so I can try and be more appealing and stable financially. I don\u2019t really know why I\u2019m here, I just kind of wanted to say this somewhere. It\u2019s always been a big fear of mine to end up alone; I don\u2019t *mind* being alone, in fact I usually love being alone and living independently, but the thought of that for the rest of my life makes me sad because I have a lot of love that I would one day want to give to someone.",

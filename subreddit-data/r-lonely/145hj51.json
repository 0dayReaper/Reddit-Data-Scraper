    "postText": "It flairs up every now and again but I\u2019ve become so pissed of with the lack of people in my social life who care. \nThe only person I ever had a shot with replaced me like it was nothing, my so called best friend doesn\u2019t contact me at all. I never get any matches with anyone I\u2019m into and when I do it always fizzles out because they aren\u2019t interested or are payed off by the Rothschild family to ignore me. \nEven the friends I make at my work probably won\u2019t want to hang out with me after work because I\u2019m going to have to leave as soon as i get a new job because I can\u2019t really hold down this one. \nI don\u2019t deserve this \nNo one deserves this \nI don\u2019t know why im never enough for anyone",

Mostly because I\u2019m just a really quite guy. I\u2019ve also had guy friends who don\u2019t talk much to me but with women they\u2019ll text them everyday and reach out to them constantly. It kinda sucks and why I don\u2019t really attempt friendships much anymore. I have one good friend and he\u2019s busy with life sometimes so somedays I don\u2019t talk to anyone.",

    "postText": "\nHii all,\nI am a 24 year old, male working in IT from my home.College is long over and so is school.\nI literally have no one to talk to.No one to go out with.\nIt's easy to say go make friends but it's actually hard at this stage.\nFrom past few days all I think about is how I am just staying alone all the time,i don't even have energy to talk to my parents.\nWhat should I do living in this perspective?\nWhere can meet new friends or is it just how adulthood is but I see people my age having friends?",

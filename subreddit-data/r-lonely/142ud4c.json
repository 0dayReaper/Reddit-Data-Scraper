    "postText": "I am sitting at home, listening to such beautiful music.\n\nMy heart feels heavy.\n\nEven though I am slowly and possibly with time even more so feeling okay with myself, feeling happy about my life and truly learning to like myself, I even more so feel a yearning in my chest.\n\nMy first and only love was so innocent, so gentle.\n\nI hope that if I find love again, it will feel so calm, and that it will stay.\n\nI hope that if I find love again, we fall even more deeply for each other when we look into our eyes and see the vulnerability inside.\n\nI hope that we grow so strong together because we love another.\n\nAnd that we support each other when our hearts don't feel so easy.\n\nI hope that when I feel love again, we will find the silly little kids inside each of us, and that they treat each other gently and play and play and play...\n\nI hope I will find love again.\n\nI would like to love someone so badly.\n\nI am crying for the first time in a long time.\n\nI am letting go of the tight grip around my heart.\n\nI am letting go.",

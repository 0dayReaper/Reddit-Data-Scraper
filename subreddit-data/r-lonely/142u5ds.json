    "postText": "Like the title says I'm caught in a cycle of extreme demotivation.  I go to work, I interact with people, do my job I come home and do basically nothing but scroll youtube and reddit until bed.  I have no friends, no relationship no surviving family and no hobbies.  I have no starting point to even meet people.  I'm 33 so I'm not exactly going out at nights and when I do go out I see young happy couples everywhere which I cannot relate to because I've never been in a relationship.  My unmotivated state comes from the fact that I am lonely and have no friends to hang out with casually.  I don't even know how to make friends or date or anything.  \n\nPeople sometimes make the effort to get to know me but I'm like a blank slate.  People expect you to have things to talk about like other friends, family and hobbies.  These are all hot topics for conversation.   \n\nI am disabled visually can't see more than 30% of what a normal person sees and I'm very forgetful and have a lot of mental fog.  So it takes me longer to find answers to standard questions to the point people just give up.  It's taken me half an hour just to articulate this post.  \n\nI feel like the hand I was dealt was specifically engineered to make my life miserable and lonely while outwardly I seem fine to others so no one even believes I have problems at all.  What they see is a guy who is cold and unfriendly.",

The only real friends I have that I can occasionally reach out to are people I met before I was even in school like pre kindergarten when your parents hang out with other parents in the area.  Any friendships I tried to develop in school were just people who ended up either resenting me behind my back or flat out pretended to be my friend to mess with me.  It's like I'm a magnet for toxic people.  \n\nI see all these people out having fun laughing and having a good time and I wish I could have that but the fact that I'm depressed and lonely makes me a total downer to be around which causes genuinely decent people to misinterpret me and distance themselves from me.  It's a vicious cycle and I don't know how to get out of it.",

Except now everyone's figured it all out, got careers, marriages, kids or businesses.\n\n Same, with \"friendships\". They had bad effect on my self-esteem. I haven't tried to look for a gf in part because of it. \n\nCareer doesn't make that much sense anymore, because I don't feel like I'm living.",

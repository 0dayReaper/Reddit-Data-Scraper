    "postText": "First post btw, so basically i been talking to this girl for an entire month, we meet in a dating app, but we were just friends, we played together almost every day, making stupid jokes and all that.\n\nShe was the first person that showed me some form of kindness, and i appreciate that, she exchanged with me so many histories, and we had so many things planned to do.\n\nI thought i had my first ever friend, i told her about every single thing about my life, all my fears and dreams, and she understanded them and gave me validation, but right now as I'm writing this she just cut every single connection we had for no apparent reason \n\nI don't know what to do, we used to joke about daddies and mommies, because we were on a dating app, but she got tired of it apparently.\n\nI was unaware of it and now i can only feel remorse, for everything i did, i though it was a joke, but she's wasn't fine with it.\n\nIf i only was normal, this wouldn't have happened, why I'm not normal, can get things anything right and i just ruin every single connection i have.\n\nI just deserve every bad that happens to me, probably this will never happen again.",

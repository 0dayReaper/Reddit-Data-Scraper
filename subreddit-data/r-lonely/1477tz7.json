I started taking CBD in the evening and that calms my mind down just enough to get to sleep. I still overthink, but instead of my mind going a million miles per hour it's like... half that hahaha.",

A yacht? What kind of yacht? \n\nMaybe I\u2019d buy the biggest tv I could, or better yet, a home theater! \n\nWould I want to buy land? Then do what with it? \n\nMaybe grow peppers and start my own hot sauce business! \n\nJust examples but it usually led to me thinking of things that I personally enjoy which led me into a deep thought rabbit hole to calm me down as well as distracted me enough to fall asleep.",

If my phone dies or something I use a trick I learned for when I'm having a panic/anxiety attack... make a list in alphabetical order of anything you want. Ex. Musicians- A ac/dc B the Beatles C cranberries D Darwins waiting room and so on. It has really worked for me to help distract myself from intrusive thoughts. Hope it can help someone else!",

She's wonderful and supportive, but very busy, and when we can't be together,I  get in my head about us, and how she'd be better off without me etc.  And it stresses her out to the point where she doesn't even want to be with me anymore.  I'm trying to learn to love myself, but I'm a useless sack of shit.  I mean I'm really not, I work hard, provide for my kids and try to be a good dad.  But my ex used to call me names every day, I was severely depressed.  I'm gonna ruin my relationship with my GF cuz I'm a whiny bitch and she doesn't have time for that.  I'm in therapy, trying to listen to some books but fuck that shit rn...  Last weekend and today I just want to crawl in a hole and die.  Ugh. Why do I feel alone?",

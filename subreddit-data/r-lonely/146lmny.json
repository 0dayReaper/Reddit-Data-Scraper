    "postText": "Hello there i am new to online dating , so don't know what to expect. I am little nervous but I try to write about myself.\r  \nI am looking for someone who would love to explore this beautiful world together. I want him to be happy and smile most of the time.\r  \n\r  \nI love reading books, watching movies, listening music and a nature like forest and many trees\r  \nI am kinda old fashioned when it comes to dating . I don't mind taking things slow at first until we get comfortable with each other.\r  \n\r  \nI am hopeless romantic and believe in true love. I enjoy cooking as well and would love to learn new recipes\r  \nI\u2019m looking for someone I can talk to daily. Let\u2019s share life stories, make each other laugh and emotionally support one another.\r  \n\r  \nMost comfortable starting online but assuming you\u2019re local I\u2019m certainly interested in making things happen IRL. I\u2019m single so there\u2019s no conflict\r  \n\r  \nI'm down with swapping pictures too, but not required by any means.\r  \n\r  \nI'm a very open book, so feel free to ask any questions you may have.\r  \n\r  \nMy DMs are open, and I\u2019m looking forward to hearing from you!",

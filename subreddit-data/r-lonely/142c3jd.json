The waitresses are nice and the older lady always gives a big smile and calls everyone \"Hon\" or \"Sweetie\".  For the hour I might be there, I feel like I'm still part of the world. It may be pathetic and sad, but it's just about my only contact with other people left outside of polite chit chat with the occasional cashier. I always leave extra large tips out of sheer thankfulness they talked to me for a minute or two. Yes, it's their job and I'm not forgetting that. I don't care. For that hour the sheer weight of my isolation is lessened somewhat and I'm grateful for that. Plus those ladies are always hustling. They deserve a decent tip.",

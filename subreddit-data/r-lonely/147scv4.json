    "postText": "I honestly don't know how to begin this thread as I feel so terribly lonely now. Anyway, I have a girlfriend and we've been together for three years. Her lack of effort in our relationship is just so upsetting. Often times I do my best to shrug it off and pretend that her not reciprocating is \"okay\", but really it's not. All this time I feel like I've been giving her my all, and she barely reciprocates a thing. Heck she doesn't even want to go on a weekend trip because her parents are against the idea of her sleeping with a man (...from a conservative family POV; she's in her late 20s btw).\n\nWhen we have disagreements it almost always end up in fights to which she's quick to say that she wants to break up. But after cooling down, she says she's sorry and doesn't mean it. I couldn't even count the number of times she wanted to break up and take it back. One thing I can say is that each time she wants to break up even on the pettiest reason for the fight, it tears me apart. I question myself, what have I done to deserve this? Why am I such a fool for still choosing to be caged in this position where I seem to be so stuck?\n\nI've already addressed these feelings to her and we've agreed to make action plans when we find ourselves in the same situation. However, there seems to be no progress as of writing. Even if I'm the one who's wronged, I still remain to be the person to chase after the other and apologize. What a fool I am.",

            "comment": "I think the biggest positive thing you could do in this situation is to inform her that it is not okay to threaten to break up over something if her intention is not to follow through. It is manipulative behavior that is distinct from having negative emotions she is dealing with. If it continues, as in if she uses the words again, then it will be on you to break it off. Give her what she claims to want. Do it for yourself so that you find someone who recognizes the severity of threatening consequences to gain personally desired outcomes. It's like taking a hostage, and you do not deserve to be held hostage from someone claiming to love you. As for the loneliness that you're already feeling, losing the relationship will do more to prove that you're still able to function than continuing to be the bad person for having any semblance of boundaries and emotions.",

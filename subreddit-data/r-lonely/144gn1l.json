I have to wait a couple days until I see her again, but fucking A idk how I can wait! I need people to shit on me or give motivation, I HAVE TO CONFESS TO HER, NO MORE RUNNING. \n\nBtw I\u2019m fairly sure she\u2019ll reject me, but I just need the closure. Wish me luck people, idk what I\u2019m gonna say but I have to say something.",

The initial approach is tough, but at least you will know where you stand with her.\nLook at me, I spent my entire life scared to ask my crushes out. Now I'm a sexless (almost) thirty year old with only two relationships under my belt.\nI don't know how old you are, but either way, don't end up like me. Shoot your shot, and if you miss, you at least tried.",

Not worth it.\nIf yes, congratulations in advance.\nKeep us updated buddy.\nGood luck.",

You need to work on building up some value before considering dating, but just like I so naively dude, you\u2019ll likely ignore this advice.",

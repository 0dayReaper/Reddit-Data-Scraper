I don't have the time or money to afford therapy for the time being.\n\nI hate my job and am fighting tooth and nail to get something better. I do have some acquitances but no real friends anymore. I've never had a girlfriend either.\n\nI need help. :(",

Just changing jobs made my daily life so much better when it comes to anxiety and feeling less stressed out.\n\n\nI hope things gets better for you soon! And that you dont have to go on alone for much longer!",

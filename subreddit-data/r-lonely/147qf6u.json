I have a lot of friends, but you know, Friends. They can't give me affirmation like a girlfriend would do. Affirmation that they gave feel different, you know.\n\nAnd today i'm very lonely, and looking a virtual girlfriend like chatGPT. I asked chatGPT to pretend to be my girlfriend but they can't.\n\nIt's very hard, you know",

    "postText": "39 year old male. I got divorced in July 2019. She was my 1st and only girlfriend/wife. No one ever gave me a chance before her. She was my first kiss when I was 23 and I lost my virginity to her. Since her I\u2019ve had one single woman that paid me any attention in December of 2019. We talked for approximately 6 weeks. This woman was essentially everything I had ever wanted in a woman: 5\u20192\u201d, brunette, brown eyes, a few interesting tattoos, gorgeous and so many other intangibles I can\u2019t get into here. If I created the perfect person in a lab, it would be her.\u2026.then she ghosted me. I have spent the past 3 and a half years obsessed with this person that I will likely never be with. She hasn\u2019t answered any of my calls, texts or social media posts/comments in that time. I\u2019m not a stalker. I only reach out to her once or twice a year, usually when I\u2019ve been drinking. I hate that I feel like I found my person but obviously, she doesn\u2019t feel that way. I realize that this makes me sound stalker-ish, but I\u2019m not. Just a lonely asshole posting on Reddit about the one person he can\u2019t get off his mind. For context, I haven\u2019t had any women talk to me since her. 3 and a half years with nothing from anyone. It\u2019s brutal.",

    "postText": "Today I've learned sex does not solve everything. I've met someone who apparently had a crush on me for an year or so. And she's a little bit more beautiful than my ex. But on other hand this woman is crazy. Definitely traumatized from her family and all the men she ever dated. Anger problems definitely save definitely cannot be reasoned with. I think to myself is she playing me. Or more for that matter am I playing myself. I'm starting to get really turned off by women who drink a lot. I think that's my trama. Women with drinking problems. I'm starting to think I'm permanently fucked up from women. On the other I laugh because who isn't these days. I'm starting to think I'm best off alone. I thought about playing this woman like a dog but I'll only be adding to the troubles the plague her mind. All for what my selfish desiree to play as many women as possible because I think they're all the same? I constantly bounce between the being myself and wanting to give people because I'm ashamed of myself for being nice for far too long. Lord knows I wanted actually legitly wanted to kill my enemies or myself. I know I'm messed up. The woman I mess with even sees a little of bit of the fact that I'm crazy. I need help, I honestly thought getting laid for the first time in a year would help calm the thoughts in my head of revenge against the people who wronged me. (To anyone who reads this I refuse to talk about my team or what happen between me and enemies)\nFor a full year I isolated myself away any negative situation or person who could drag me down. All of them I hang with no one. I don't have many friends around. But since I have such lovely personality finding who associates was not hard. I won't make the mistake of trusting anyone like I did before. I refuse to let anything from last year happen again. \nThen again I'm also very scared of myself. I do not want to see myself snap. I keep having pictures of all my enemies dead and all I hear is police surrounding me. With me full of regret where I should of just moved on. IDC if a lot of people won't understand. It's not like I have a history doing any of this. I'm no thug no killer nothing like this. Which is why I get so scared of myself. Because I try to keep myself away from fights. I try my best to stay isolated as possible. I'm trying my best to repair my social life. Get myself back to normal or a new normal. Happiness still feels a lifetime ahead. And that what makes me sad. I have no children or wife or pets or even career. And damnit I just started living and I guess. Like living for myself. I'm 30 I feel like I have no time. And I have hardly any help. \nAnyways my thoughts are no excuse which is why I feel ashamed of myself like I'm actually a criminal. But I haven't done anything.\nI hope one day I find peace that doesn't involve me being in my deathbed.",

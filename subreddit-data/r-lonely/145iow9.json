    "postText": "So I just bought tickets to one of the Foo Fighters Concerts here in New Zealand in January, really excited as I bought tickets to their previous concert but was cancelled because of the passing of Taylor Hawkins. I\u2019m very happy to see they are coming back and I am glad that I will be able to see them, the only downside is that I\u2019ll be going by myself. The few friends I have either don\u2019t want to go or are going to a different showing with there own group of friends, So it\u2019ll just be me, makes me feel sad.",

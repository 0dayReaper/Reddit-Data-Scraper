I\u2019m trying so hard to forget and focus on myself but how can I when I work 5 days straight, 8 hour shifts all the time. \n\nHe ghosted me and it\u2019s been weeks since I last heard from him, I\u2019ve just been blocked, and not a word from him. \n\nJust reminds me how dangerous it is to be lonely and then rely on someone, I have friends but we\u2019re not close, and he was so special to me, what\u2019s funny is that we met on this subreddit.",

            "comment": "Hiya,\n\nSorry to hear you've been ghosted, happens to far too many on this subreddit. It's good that you're occupying your mind with work, but like you said, putting it off leads to more intense feelings of loneliness in your free time. \n\nYou can appreciate the time you spent talking and discussing topics with him since especially online its difficult to form a connection with others so when we do we lean into it. Its especially unfair how things were apparently going well and all of a sudden poof, gone.\n\nTry not to torture yourself over why he's done this, could've been a whole bibles worth of possibilities.  \n\nLet it be a lesson to not get too attached to those online, or to simply keep them at a distance, obviously you couldn't of known at the time but we all get burned someday. Try to recognise the signs that led to you relying on this man so in the future should a similar situation occur, you can deal with it far better than you are now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to DM, you'll pull through this!\n\nTake care of yourself!",

Moving on from him will not be an easy process to manage, but it is something you will be able to do. \n\nIf you\u2019re up to it again, maybe you\u2019ll find someone new on here to talk with and have the same or similar conversations. \n\nFor the meantime. Out of sight, out of mind.",

Unfortunately, I don\u2019t bother connecting or trying for friendships online anymore because 9 times out of 10, they always leave without a word. Now that I\u2019m remembering clearly\u2026 I have had someone ghost me after a month of talking. They told me they loved talking to me and right after they stopped talking. No idea what happened but they continue to live their lives and so have I. \n\nI hope you get to find your new friends sooner rather then later. But in the meantime.. give yourself time for yourself and understanding your emotions. You\u2019re absolutely right in living life! Make sure you\u2019re having a blast while doing it!",

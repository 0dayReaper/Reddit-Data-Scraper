    "postText": "For almost all my life I\u2019ve been like a ghost, lurking around in the background, never in the spotlight and never being truly alive. \n\nI\u2019ve got basically no life experiences worth mentioning, no achievements whatsoever, I\u2019ve never had a romantic relationship (mostly because I\u2019m invisible to most people since I very rarely leave the house and when I do it\u2019s usually to haunt the streets at night like some lost spirit) and I\u2019ve had no true friendships except for one, and even that relationship is very dysfunctional. \n\nI exist, and have existed for years, as some corpse that barely moves, hardly coming out of my room, I really might as well be dead since there\u2019s no kinetic energy, no growth, no vitality in my life. Nothing ever happens. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to resurrect myself, I\u2019d need to start going out more I know that, and meeting people\u2026 but it\u2019s not so easy\u2026 I live in a shithole, a brain-drain where all the successful people leave as soon as they get the chance, leaving behind only losers like me. I dread the thought that the rest of my life could be spent stalking the streets of my dead little town\u2026\n\nMaybe some of you can relate?",

I\u2019m there but I felt like I wasn\u2019t so most of the time I ended going home early without telling anyone , just walked off. Nowadays I feel like a robot just go to work and get home asap . Maybe the occasional meet up my friends and talk about life. Other than that I would rather stay at home or sometimes just go to a cafe or a walk with my earbuds in.",

Anyway, music can help one feel less alone. Try and find an album you can relate to during this season of your life.",

Lost my high school friend of 38 yrs and just last week another friend of 17 yrs. I didn't do anything to cause this. I'm not depressed, just numb. I don't celebrate holidays. No one calls.  W I used to be so social! Now I'm just broken loser. Tried everything to get friend s but I am toxic. Everybody runs away. I need a nice pet. I avoid looking at people in my gym. That's the only place I go..",

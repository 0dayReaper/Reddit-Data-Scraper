    "postText": "Why does it feel almost impossible to make friends when you\u2019re in your 30\u2019s. You do it without even trying in high school, just naturally gravitating towards people with similar interests. You start hanging out, becoming close and thinking, \u201cMan this is my bestie for life!\u201d But flash forward 15 years or so and ya\u2019ll barely talk. Forget about hanging out. So you figure you\u2019ll just make some new friends right? It shouldn\u2019t be that hard\u2026right? Maybe it\u2019s the anxiety talking but I don\u2019t even know where to start in that regard, and the loneliness is getting to me.",

            "comment": "For me the answer is that it is discouraged everywhere you go. Your interactions at work are supposed to be in furtherance of your job, and what time you have left over tends to be further devalued by the reality that other people are living their lives too, chained by their responsibilities. If I can only meet or talk to you for an hour a week after considering both parties existing issues, then how are you supposed to form that strong bond which would make that single hour's interaction feel valuable on both ends? In school, you spend hours on end just doing what you like, and finding out others like what you do. You don't need to worry about moving your schedule to meet with theirs because all involved parties have the same schedule and no other responsibilities to consider (by and large).",

            "comment": "People are creatures of habits, everyone wants to have clear path and stable life at some point, so around age of 30 most people just dont want to get new friends, they either have some close ones already or created family they need to spend time with. \n\nPriority in 30s is to try to stabilise what life you already have, not to create brand new connection (which is just additional work) or revive old ones. So if you are late bloomer or you fall behind, then its your problem. \n\nI learned that when i was working with younger people, ages 20-25 are very easy to make friends. 30-35+ hell no. So best to find a way to hangout with young guys.",

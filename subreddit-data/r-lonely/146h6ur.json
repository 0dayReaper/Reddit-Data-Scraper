I live in the city by a bunch of bars/things to do and you\u2019d think it\u2019d be easy to make friends but I guess I\u2019m really just not like able. I feel really low, like something is just deeply wrong with me. Anyone else in the same boat?",

I have \u201cfriends\u201d but I know that I\u2019m the last they would choose for anything and lately I\u2019ve been thinking that it\u2019s better to be alone than to feel lonely surrounded by people. So I spend all my time by myself and love it. It\u2019s also Saturday night and I\u2019m at home enjoying myself \ud83e\udd0d life is good",

They'll feign interest in your pain and say they relate to you but they'll find a way to turn things sexual. \n\nI have experienced this over and over on reddit without fail and this sub seems to be a breeding ground for guys looking for lonely women to prey on. \n\nI may be lonely and a bit depressed but I know predatory behavior when I see it so this will probably be the last post I make on here.",

I'm not saying that you have no reason to say it. If you are being stalked by other shitty men this is a totally understandable and coherent point of view.\n\nI don't possess the absolute truth on this matter, i'm just giving my point of view\n\nI think i've reasons to question the statement that says a majority of men are trash though (not telling that i'm sure this concerns only a minority).\n\nI'm not saying that this matter is of the small kind, i do think this is a realy serious matter on the internet that concerns a lot of women. However i think internet represents attrition and sample bias in itself.\n\nShitty behaviors can be spread by a minority (not negligible) part of men. They, being particularly active can give a false representation of men bahaviors in general. Moreover the threads of women calling out these behaviors are real but cannot give a true representation of men behaviors in general because it is not counterbalanced by threads pointing out all the times where men showed basic human decency because such behavior is normal and have not to be particularly emphasized.\n\nIn short i think the matter you are pointing out has legitimacy to be adressed, i'm just questionning the generalization i seem to see particularly in the comment section. If studies show that this behavior concerns a majority of men i'm willing to change my point of view, but i think that it's better to address such problems precisly rather than saying this apply to men by default.\n\nIn a more personnal way, i do see the damage that these behaviors cause, but i cannot help to be saddened by the fact other people would be fearful discussing with me because of these behaviors. After all we agree on the fact that these men are trash and we would be all better without them, particularly women.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit : And just to be clear, you have every rights to chose not to talk to men if that brings negative experiences.",

It doesn't really matter if not all men or women engage in toxic behavior. \n\nIt's enough of each side for it to be a problem. In the same way where it's not socially acceptable to engage in abusive or toxic behaviors the conversation should be shifted to shaming people who do this rather than getting defensive because it's not something you do individually. \nIf more \"nice guys\" actually called this behavior out when they saw it this issue wouldnt be so prevelant. I and other women certainly shame and look down on women who use their bodies to manipulate men for financial reasons - theres a reason the word gold digger is a label women do not like to be labeled with. There are also some radical feminists out there who are not constructive and really make it hard to have these conversations.\n\nBut so far everytime the toxic behaviors of men comes up, the conversation shifts to \"nice guys\" taking it as an attack on themselves individually and on their entire gender indiscriminately.

I'm sure there is a decent amount of the reversal of such (gold diggers who know how easy it is to get lonely guys to do anything for attention) but it's all bad. \n\nI'm upvoting OP because this message is true, be on your guard even if dudes seem nice for the first bit. If they act like they wanna get closer don't accept dick pics or submit to nude \npic requests. The attention is nice for a brief bit but if you look for more than brief flattery you need to be selective and cautious.

I think these are important questions that each member of this sub should be asking other people and even themselves. Some people are here to have conversations with random strangers, some people want to make actual friends, and other people are here just to trade pics.\n\n\n I think this stereotype of men with ulterior motives comes from a couple different places. One, that reddit is a male dominated social media platform (so as a female, it's more likely that you will receive messages from said men). Two, that many men define \"loneliness\" as a lack of sexual attention. I knew a guy who had plenty of friends, but was so hung up on trying to get a girlfriend that he let that consume him and he called that being lonely. DO I consider this guy to be lonely by my own definition? Well, not really. Does he consider himself to be lonely? Yes. Is his loneliness valid? Sure. So I guess what I'm trying to say is that there are multiple different ways to feel lonely. Either lack of friends or lack of a partner could be reasons someone is feeling alone. I don't consider someone to be truly lonely unless they are lacking both, because honestly, you should appreciate what you have.\n\n\nNobody here has likely experienced true isolation, unless you live completely alone, work a job as the only employee, only go places where nobody is around, etc... (Some people have the unhealthy behavior of socially isolating themselves). If you want to experience true loneliness, you could become a hermit in the woods or live atop a mountain or something.\n\n\n I'm a gay male, so nothing that was said here really applies to me as far as straight relationship dynamics go, but what is the same is the dynamic of dming on Reddit and trading pics (it happens all the time!). There will always be people you find to be undesirable in your DMs, that's just the way it is. I ride public transportation in southern California, and there are some shady ass people tryna talk to me all the time.  Does it make me uncomfortable? Of course. Dealing with these types of situations is an important skill to have. I usually wear headphones and sit away from other people to avoid having people talk to me. On Reddit, it's much easier. You can start talking to whoever you want and when you don't like where things are going, you can block or ignore. I try not to be disgusted by the reality of things, because that's an unhealthy viewpoint to have.\n\n\nAs for why I'm lonely, I just moved to a new state and started community college, I have yet to build any lasting relationships at school, and I don't have a job and commute from home where I live with my parents. I don't really crave the social interaction as much, because I'm pretty fond of talking to people online, but I would really like real life friends or a partner. Why am I on this sub? Mostly to relate to other people's experiences and just lurk and read some posts like I do with all subreddits. Maybe I'll have the inclination to comment somewhere and it might make a difference in somebody's life. If you asked some other guys why they were here, they might not be honest with you. Their true intentions might be to look for different girls, slide into DMs, and ask for pics.\n\n\nI just also want to point out that being lonely doesn't have to be a vulnerability, so as a female, I would carefully vet all dms, check profiles like you said, and overall try to be aware and gauge what type of person it is I'm actually talking to. There are also many guys here who will feel personally attacked by this message you're sending as well, because they've likely been mischaracterized in this way by other females, or maybe they feel guilty because they also engaged in this behavior.",

And porn makes everything so much worse , im glad i finaly quiet. But on reddit you will find guys that spend a lot of time on their screen , so they will likely watch much porn. Except the guys in the nofap sub ;)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand there are of course biological reason for this behavior. And I believe platonic relationships are a hoax in almost every case. A man searching for a deeper connection with a woman without having sexual interessts in her is very unlikely. We want to spread our genes. If a woman is in a deeper friendship without any sexual interesst in us we feel degraded in a way. We got out selected. Maybe women feeling the same way if this happens , but they don't have the problem because the men is interessted in almost every case. So its sounds hard , but why should a guy really care about a woman that subcounscsiouly humilate him and seeing him not as a real man? Of course we search emotional support in woman , but this is even a greater hoax.\n\nThe problem is that men are not capable to have deep relationships to another , we get trained that everything emotional in your life you have to talk about with a female. We are afraid of deep emotional contact with other man , which is our greatest weakness compared to woman. Maybe its because we are all nurtured and risen by our mother , so for woman its very much easier to have emotional talk with her friends.",

            "comment": "i made a throwaway account just to comment on this. \n\nI'm a guy. A lonely guy. A PAINFULLY lonely guy. What i want in life more than anything is to have a genuine connection with a woman and to be in love.   \n\n\nI have bad coping mechanizes. One of them is to seek out sexual behavior online. I'm lonely, and I don't want to be alone. So when I'm talking to someone part of me wants to behave sexually because its a connection, a painfully shallow connection but its more than Ive got.   \n\n\nHere is the thing though, that doesn't mean I don't care. I hate that attitude. I make it a point to be respectful, honest, and upfront about my issues. When I listen to someone elses, its because I care. I know what its like to have no one care, and I want to be there for this other person I'm talking to. Me wanting something sexual doesn't change that. There have been time when people opened up to me about stuff where I just said to myself \"this isn't the time\" and didn't pursue anything remotly sexual with them because i really and truely cared about this other person, even if i just met them. There have been times where people said they had a BF and so I didn't pursue anything sexual, cause that would have been wrong. There have been times when people opened up about rape, or abuse, or just other issues that they needed to talk about and I didn't.   \n\n\nI wanted to be sexual with every one of those women. I messaged them because I was lonely, they were lonely, and I thought maybe we could be open with each other, talk about our stuff, and be sexual somewhere in the middle of all of that. maybe  we could both feel a little less lonely. That doesn't negate the fact that I cared and actually wanted to be their for them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwanting to be sexual doesn't mean im feigning interest. It doesn't negate me wanting to get to know a person, and it doesn't mean I am just \"preying on\" people. I'm honest, upfront, and respect boundries. That doesn't make me a bad fucking person.",

If you don't feel like this describes you, then you don't need to get defensive.\n\n However, consider this from a women's perspective. While you might feel like you're just reacting unconsciously to a human connection and you don't mean to prey on people, you could be 1 of 200 guys in her inbox with the same thoughts or feelings. From her perspective it begins to look like that's all everyone in her inbox is after, even if that may not always be the case. The issue here is that you don't know how to make human connections without making it sexual, and it comes across as especially insincere when there are 199 other guys doing the same exact thing in her inbox. I understand you're lonely, and you yearn for physical attention, but people pick up on that loneliness and that strong feeling of wanting attention and that tends to ward people off because no one wants to be the subject of those kinds of desires because it doesn't have standards and it doesn't really make you feel special. From the way you describe it, you basically get sexual with every girl you make any kind of connection to. Not only is that not healthy, but it shows a lack of standards and it could easily make someone feel like their only value to you is to appease your loneliness and craving for physical affection. That's kind of shitty any way you look at it.",

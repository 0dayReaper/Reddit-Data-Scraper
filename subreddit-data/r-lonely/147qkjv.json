    "postText": "Nobody cares. I never really had any friends. Broken family. Never been in a relationship. Nobody ever showed any compassion towards me. I've been depressed since the day I was born. What's the point of living?\n\nI used to have so much hope, but now I'm just really burnt out. Sure I've tried to live for myself and distract myself, but everything just seems so empty now. I've helped others to the point of people pleasing and sacrificing my own well being because I know that it sucks feeling depressed and being this way, but I ended up getting used and abused and being left alone all over again.\n\nWhat's the point if you're not good enough for anybody? Maybe I'm just too broken to function nowadays. I don't want to keep going on anymore. Everyday is just a struggle in my own mind and the loneliness is getting to me. I want to be intimate with somebody, but I'm a wreck. I don't want to trust anyone anymore.\n\nI just want to cease to exist. I held on for so long thinking it would get \"better\" but it never did.",

But that's only me...and people don't get it the truly don't. That pain of them saying they do but know personally impossible makes it all the more worse...they say live, you matter but really it's stay here and suffer because I BELIEVE THAT PAIN DOESN'T MATTER I BELIEVE YOU CAN OVERCOME IT BUT THEY DONT KNOW A FUCKING THING. They never could... because even if experiencing similar it's not the same...they have you stay... tortured for their own peace of mind....it's made me hate people...how fucking projective, blissfully blindly optimistic and patronizing they are irrespective of intentions bc they think they know and you can't fucking tell them bc they'll never get it lmao. They'll instinctively make thier own mental connection and project that to you as if the same fucking person 'you can bc other people do, you can bc I did' WHEN ITS NEVER THE FUCKING SAME...but yeah just my opinion lmao",

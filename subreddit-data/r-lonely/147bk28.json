This is leading them down very lonely and paranoid trains of thought. \n\nI think it\u2019s a form of manic depression maybe.\n\nI\u2019m not sure whether apologizing will give him a little peace or just dredge up old memories he never wanted to think about.\n\nI really want to apologize for my sake as well. I hate what I did.",

I wouldn't want to hear from him now, but nearer the time it happened his remorselessness broke me. I learned so many bad things about him and he seemed so irredeemable that I lost faith in my own judgment to this day. \n\nIt would have been nice to know I didn't waste a decade nurturing a stone evil being. \n\nSo maybe he would appreciate it, if you can manage to apologize without doing a full fledged autopsy of the relationship,  creating more pain for you both. \n\nPS: Are you sure what you did was that terrible? I do not think someone who not only wants to make amends but questions her motivations for doing could be all that terrible. \n\nYou also have to forgive yourself for human frailty.",

    "postText": "I see a lot of depressed and sad posts here everyday. Most of posts are from teanagers or young people in 20's which makes me feel bad cuz if you're not able to cope with reality of world at this age than what are you gonna do in 30's or 40's while facing a crisis or bad times. Strong mentality is a necessity for surviving throughout your life which isn't indeed as easy as said.\nI am 30m I've lived past 15 years alone while most of it was in same city as my family only for 2 years I was in another city. I dropped out during graduation to start working, I've tried to support my siblings and mom on a lot of occasions in many ways. Still I was never accepted to be living with them, it got me down alot of times too. I think the most that depression gets to me is when I smoke weed every December which I started doing after quitting regular alcohol and weed back in 2017. But every year I keep my promise to myself for staying away from these and reward myself with just hash or weed for a whole month of December. \nI lost my youngest brother in 2021 which hurts the most out of anything else I faced in this short span of life until now. I've switched 3 careers in past 15 years made huge losses monetarily in life had couple of long term relationship breakups nothing kept me down. For past 8-9 years I'm firmly stranding in garments business went from one store to 3 and than back to barely 1 after COVID. \nI spend my time divided in to my store and myself, only people I meet mostly are work related and families are occasional or when they need something from me and it stopped bothering me way long ago. I accepted it as it is my duty to help them when they're in need and not let me get effected by emotions much. Almost every night I play games on PC I made few friends randomly from discord from my country and happened to meet them all almost whenever I went to their cities for business ventures. \nOnce in a year or two I go out to northern areas to see mountains and beauty of earth and skies. \nIn these hard times everything can make you feel depressed just focus on never giving up and keep trying always remember happiness is in few moments around a day or week and not everyday or every minute could be a full of joy/fun. Even the richest of people have so much stress that their lives are not that much enjoyable. So cherish every small moment of happiness on your own do something for yourself rely on your own to make yourself happy. Don't depend on someone else or let yourself have expectations from others because what power you have in your own decisions will only be satisfactory expectations and dependency will always anchor you down. \nHopefully it helps someone and sorry for my English as it's not my first language..\nHave a great life ahead of you folks! Best of luck!!!",

    "postText": "I've gone out in public a couple times in the past month or so with family and it always feels like I'm unable to make any kind of connection with others. I try talking with them about relatable things but I want an actual friendship. I end up never seeing them again and it just feels unresolved. hell, a lot of times I just wish to end up staying with someone else for the night because I'm tired of going home alone and sleeping in a bed that's too big. plus it's even harder being a gay man in a not very gay-friendly area (or maybe that's just paranoia kicking in, idk) - I feel like I can't talk about some things because of that fear of rejection.",

    "postText": "I'm still a teen and I just realized I parented myself. I got through so much pain and suffering. Both my parents are equally immature. One got mad over a damn stuff toy, one said they wouldn't interfere in between us even though one (1) is their significant other and my parent while they too[one (2)] are my parent. \nYou're own your own kid made me realize this. Taylor swift might not know this, but she's healing people who were hurt by the people who are supposed to be a person's safe place. \nNo, I'm not mad because of this sole incident. It's a series of events. At this point, I'm just looking forward to college. Coz others my age, they get scared when they hear one single scream. I'm used to Screams in my house all day long. It's sad but not their fault either. I hope my friends never have to go through this. \nBut it would be nice to have someone to share this with. I'm the therapist friend but I don't have a therapist friend. \nShould I try to convince the Manchild and the Womanchild to put me in therapy? I mean, even if they did, the therapist would just tell them everything would they not?\nI'm so sorry yall had to read all of this, the comments are always open if yall need someone to hear you out, im here to hear you out.\nPretty long lmao",

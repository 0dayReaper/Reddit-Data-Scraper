    "postText": "Being born with a very complex and serious chronic condition I was aware of my mortality from a young age but it was always something conceptual in some future time which was very different compared to now that I\u2019m facing the reality of it. While this is the story everyone has to go through (though usually and hopefully at a more significant age) the realization of how alone I truly am is as world-shattering as my imminent death. Everytime I brought it up in the past to a few friends or partners it was usually just pushed off (\u201cOh you\u2019re not going anywhere\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll live to a ripe old age\u201d etc, which I always found highly offensive and demeaning to someone who actually has to live with it and is the one who is aware of what the doctors have been continuously explaining to him). But now as those friends have moved on in life (including ones I met in the hospital who were dealing with similar though less serious cases) I have no one to turn to to discuss this with. In fact the woman I was seeing for the last 4 months left because I was getting too depressed and she didn\u2019t want it dragging her down. The thing is I don\u2019t even blame anyone for their unwillingness to talk about it or deal with it. Everyone has their own lives and own troubles and it\u2019s difficult to step out of that and take on someone else's pain. But it\u2019s frustrating when my whole world, the only reality I know, is disintegrating around me and I\u2019m in the center screaming, as everyone goes about their day to day lives completely unconscious of the sound.",

I also know full well the mental state of someone going through it. Stay strong bro and know whatever happens you keep fighting. No time to dwell on people or things you can't control. Just keep living every day to the fullest and fuck everyone else.",

Facing your mortality can be very lonely, even with a support system, especially if none of them are dying - they can't really understand what you're going through. I am here if you want someone to talk to who gets it.",

            "comment": "Same situation here.  Two months after receiving my diagnosis, my wife cheated on me. We have now been separated for three weeks and our home is up for sale and I have had no luck in finding any place to go.\nShe says that the infidelity was the opportunity she latched onto to get out of our marriage. She does not want to have to support/live with someone who is terminal. I am still reeling from the diagnosis as well as knowing now that I am married to such a selfish and cold whore.  I am in shock that I am going to be dying alone somewhere in the near future. This is definitely more devastating than the diagnosis itself. \nI cannot believe how horrible such a seemingly loving woman became.",

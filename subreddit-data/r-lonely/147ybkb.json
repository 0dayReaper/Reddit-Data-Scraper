    "postText": "I just turned 23... I'm 23 and I don't know what I'm doing anymore. My parents spent their entire lives trying to give me a good life. Teaching me when they can, while working so many hours that they look 80 when they're really 60. They got me through school, college, and now I'm working... For what?\r  \n\r  \nI make decent cash, but nowhere enough to buy a house in the next 15 years. I wouldn't be surprised if they're dead by that point. So what's the point of all the hell they've been through? They spent their lives on me, but I have nothing to give them back.  And what about the hours of sleepless nights I spent studying for useless classes that I'll never use again? Why did we go through all this hell, only to be put in another, worse world?\r  \n\r  \nI keep saying to myself. \"I gotta improve myself! I gotta get a better job! Workout! Get a partner!\" But I lost that will to fight the second I got out of college. I've just been... coasting... floating along, not giving a shit to what happens to me. Watching porn, playing games, doing everything and anything to distract myself from my inevitable end: I'm going to die alone. I'm going to die alone without doing anything important in my life. No one will remember me and no one will care...\r  \n\r  \nUsually, I'm a happy-go-lucky person that thinks everything works out in the end, but today I just broke down. Fake-it til you make it can only last you so long. Stress of work, stress of my decaying body, stress of losing my parents, stress of never being good enough or mattering, stress of wasting my time on useless shit. It all caught up to me, and now I'm on my laptop, writing all this, so someone can... Yeah... I know... No can save me...\r  \n\r  \nThere's no saving a waste of space like me. I'm one of billions... My life never mattered to being with... I just... I just wanna sleep in someone's loving hands. And never wake up again.",

I feel this\u2026completely not to brag, but similar to you, I\u2019m done with college recently, work a six figure job, have a muscular build, and am objectively not batshit ugly. Tinder/bumble? Forget it, I\u2019m like a grain of sand in the desert. Talk to people in person? Striking up a conversation, even a smiling \u201chey, that\u2019s a really nice coat,\u201d makes people look at me like they\u2019re staring into the eyes of Ted Bundy. What\u2019s missing??? More money would definitely hope but come on if it\u2019s just the multi millionaires fucking then we\u2019ll be out of people by 2100. Seriously\u2026what\u2019s missing?",

            "comment": "Hey 31m here. I relate to that very well. I would add that my parents were also slightly overprotective and that left a mark on my confidence but they always had the best intentions and always worked hard, exactly as you described. During the pandemic I had the time to put in and work on myself since I worked from home. I lost weight, put on muscle, developed new skills and it was also because my previous relationships were toxic and hurtful so I finally felt free. My last one lasted 4 years but it took a big toll on me. However, after about a year and a half I felt I lost motivation because I didn't see what all I was doing was for since I needed someone to share all that with. I tried travelling a bit on my own at least one day trips and tried new activities every week or two. The issue is that also can only last for so long. We are social beings and need a partner, someone to call your own, I do understand that very well. Stress due to work and a failing relationship that was eating at me caused me health issues that added to my confidence and thought nobody would be happy with me but just kept going and fought through it. \n\nNow, I met someone online, she's the sweetest and we can always openly speak our minds and talk knowing that there will be care and understanding no matter what. Work and life is in the way of traveling but we have a plan and will get to sleep in loving arms in a few months. Ever since my motivation returned and we both work on bettering ourselves as individuals and as a couple. \n\nWhat I can say is it is possible, it will happen when the time is right. I am not a spiritual person at all, I'm objective and this is simply through observation of myself and others. Please never stop, stick to your plan and change it when needed, follow your gut instinct and filter it through your own thought process and I can promise that when the time is right things will fall into place, you will find someone right for you, you will go through a few wrong jobs until you find one that makes you happy and fulfills your needs, you will be happy. Just DO NOT stop going forward! Taking a break is ok, just floating when you're tired is ok, but even if just floating you still follow the course of your own \"river\". You only lose when you stop, so right now you are doing your best, as an internet friend of you would like I am proud of you and nobody could ask more of you. Your person is there and they will find you. And no, I don't mean the clich\u00e9 that there is someone for everyone, but there are many and there will be opportunities that you'll choose from. Go where you are happy, go where you are loved back for the love you give, be proud of yourself and of your parents. You are doing so well right now and I know it's hard to see, but you are, my friend!",

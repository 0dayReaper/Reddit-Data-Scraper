    "postText": "I'm a 16 year old male, and I'm very isolated and alone. I try to make friends but that never seems to work for me that well. I've tried talking to people online and in person. During the summer with not having anything to do I get very bored and my mental issues start to act worse.I just want some people to talk to, to become friends with, just have human connection whether it's online or offline. I don't care who a person is just as long as they're friendly.",

Now that I\u2019ve ended it I am really feeling the void of loneliness despite knowing I made the right decision to end the relationship. Please, someone just tell me about their day",

I\u2019ve learned even if someone isn\u2019t right for us, the void and emptiness still comes after a breakup. I know it feels like it\u2019s never going to end but it is. I\u2019m currently feeling absolutely empty and anxious and depressed all at once. We can\u2019t make people be what we need them to be.",

What is suppose to be your best friend instead is a roommate that gives no emotion or attention to which makes the loneliness that much worse.",

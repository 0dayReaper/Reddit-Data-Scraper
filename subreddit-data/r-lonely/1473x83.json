            "comment": "This is an issue I find endemic to clubs/party scene. (Context) I\u2019ve spent years working as a bouncer, people who go to clubs often are selfish and think about themselves and their needs. I\u2019ve often sat alone feeling like there\u2019s no one in there that I could connect with. \n\nNot my idea of fun not my idea of a good time. People go with groups and friends and tend to loose all inhibitions and there are emotional predators that take advantage of that. People don\u2019t get to know each other and just see what\u2019s on the surface. \n\nI too have had my fair share of being put on a pedestal. I\u2019ve been asked to take my shirt off in clubs or people grab at my tattoos with out consent to touch me neglecting my personal space, or felt up with out my consent in crowded areas. \n\nI feel you",

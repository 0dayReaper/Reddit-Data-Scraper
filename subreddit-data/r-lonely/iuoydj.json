    "postText": "I just know it, deep down. I'm 32 now. I've had two boyfriends in my life. One cheated on me, the other one abused me, cheated and left. I've been trying to stay positive all these years. My friends would describe me as the ultimate extrovert, I'm very social at parties, I'm funny and positive.  I'm fit, I'm attractive, I'm smart. I'm not trying to brag, but I know my worth and I know my weaknesses. Only a few know though how I feel deep down. \n\nI've really been trying to put myself out there. All dating apps in the book, sports clubs, parties, friends of friends. Ever since my last ex left (4 years ago) I haven't even been close to having a boyfriend again. And it's not because I never like anyone. In the past four years, I've probably really liked about 10 different guys (even had feelings for  few) and in the end they never wanted me. They would date me, sleep with me and then they would tell me they don't want anything serious. And I'm not going for the typical douchebag looking guys. I've been disappointed again and again and still I tried to meet guys.\n\nWhen I was younger I always dreamed of having  family. A husband, kids and a dog. Now, at 32, this seems incredibly far away. A few months ago, I thought I got pregnant by a guy that I was seeing for about two months. How sad is it that I was almost hoping I was actually pregnant? Somehow I thought that this might be the only chance I'll ever have for having a child, even if I'd be a single Mom. \n\nAll of my single friends complained about not finding anyone, and yet they all found someone. I'm the only one who never did. My best friend can't believe it and says my love live is jinxed. I don't know anyone who's so incredibly unlucky with dating. At this point I'm a 100% sure I'll end up alone. I guess I'll have to accept that the best thing that I can get dating-wise is good sex and some companionship. And I hate that this makes me sad, but it just sometimes does.\n\nAnyone 30+ feeling the same?",

Yet the only thing I have ever really wanted as long as i can remember, is love.  So I'm wondering why am I even here, is it just a cruel joke?",

I feel this thread in my fecking bones and it\u2019s as sucky as it is relatable so I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not going through this alone though I do wonder just like many of you all how in the heck I\u2019m going to progress when my main fear is being used, or ghosted by a guy who was looking for greener pastures (looking for a prettier, younger more sexual \u2018yes\u2019 girl) and I\u2019m battling so hard not to turn into the left on the shelf fish wife. Cause we all know no one wants a woman battling with anxiety still after all this time. Or a woman who despite attending a university still has no idea where she belongs in life after having all her dreams dashed and financial plans scuppered out of her control. \nThere\u2019s still a flip side to it. I have no one to use me, hurt me or lead me on for a laugh. I think at this point in my honest opinion and at least for myself this is one of those stages in my life where most women my age have to learn to be lonely and find something else. Some days it\u2019s not all bad. And I\u2019ve made peace with the fact that maybe it\u2019s just me who\u2019s done this to herself. It\u2019s a harsh lesson to learn and I guess when I find the answers I\u2019ll come back and give as best in terms of advice if I could. But I got nothing, just a heartfelt \u2018I feel this and I\u2019m struggling to come to terms with this reality myself\u2019 \n\nI hope we all find peace.",

I'm not an attractive guy. Like, freakishly unattractive. The two relationships I had were only because they got to know me first (worked with one, friends with the other) yet despite taking a chance on me, neither could keep themselves from looking to greener pastures. I was an experiment, a lark. With one I know I was basically just a chance to prove to her friends that she wasn't shallow (she explicitly told me so at the end). Neither was serious about me.\n\nAt this point I have completely ruled out finding someone. Even if someone were to show interest, I wouldn't know what to do (it's been 10 years). I am 100% throwing in the towel and trying to find something else that will make me happy. I've made peace with it, though. Not everyone finds someone. That doesn't mean I can't have a good life.",

I hope it resonates with you, or you find it useful in some small way.* \n\nIt's okay.\n\nYears ago, we were in our 20s, and we were *sure* we had it all figured out. Of course, we didn't. lol. But yo, life doesn't end at 29. Shit, we haven't even reached the halfway point yet! Not just that, but think of all the people in this reddit. This isn't a minor phenomenon, this *wide spread.* It's a symptom of our generation, they say. For everybody that participates in this reddit, there are another 100 people that feel the same way, out in the world. That means, in *your* city/town. You *can*, and you **will** find somebody. \n\nYou can trust me when I tell you, *It's all going to be okay.* You have my word, just *don't give up.*\n\nThe fact that you can admit that to yourself, shows me that you have the amount of self-awareness that's needed to take control, and manage those thoughts. \n\n*You're in the prime of your life, OP.* Your current perspective would tell you otherwise; but the great news, is that *perception can be changed*. Not only that, but it's also true that how we see ourselves, also shapes the way we experience the world, and influences the people around us. It's all about perception, and reaction.\n\nWhat I'm *not* saying, is that \"positive thinking\" will somehow manifest your wishes and desires. Like that new-age, Dr. Phil *bullshit* you were talking about. What I am saying though, is this:\n\nYou **do** have power. You **do** have agency. The whole world, and your future in it, ***is in your hands****; and you don't even realize it.* \n\nIf you don't mind, I'm going to get a little existential, and wordy here. At the same time though, what I'm saying is scientifically proven, and 100% possible for *anyone*. You might even have already tried it. Please though, bear with me. This isn't new-age bullcrap, I promise.\n\nThe practice is called, \"Mindfulness\"\n\n A matter of fact: If you can separate your conscious awareness from your raw emotion, you can learn how to understand, interpret, and *choose* how you react to that emotion. \n\nSo; when we feel emotion, it's because the stimuli we were exposed to caused our brains to make an association with it, and our memories. In the split second that process takes, your brain finds that association in your memory \"bank\", and then releases chemicals to trigger the appropriate emotion. Then, from that emotion, \"we\" (our conscious minds) now have to make a decision in *response* to that emotion. It could be to cry if we're hurt, yell if we felt angry, or flee if fear is triggered.\n\nFor example, a hypothetical: Let's say you were bitten by a dog as a child. You growing brain reacts by creating a new connection between neurons. A new memory. In this case, \"Dog = pain, harm, *injury* = **avoid at all costs**\". Then, 20 years later (having never seen a dog since), a friend approaches you with his pet dog. Your brain takes in this information, takes that split second to search through your memories, and make it's association. \"Dog = pain\". It then releases the needed biochemicals to trigger an appropriate response; Fear. Then, you feel that emotion and consciously decide an action to take. In this case, fight, flee, or freeze? In this situation, you're so overcome by the fear of being bitten, you freeze. Then in reaction to you, the dog picks up on your fear, it's instincts are triggered, and it lunges and bites you.\n\nNow, of course you aren't aware of the neurons firing, or the biochemical reactions in your own brain. The entire process happens unconsciously, and in a fraction of a second. \n\nSo, from your perspective, \"Dogs are scary\". You can't (immediately) change that initial \"triggering\" process, but what you *can* do, is change how you *react* to the emotion that's triggered. You can learn to understand what you're feeling, why you're feeling that way, etc. and that is what empowers you. \n\nIn that way, you have power over your thoughts, and with that, the power to change your own perspective, and ultimately, the people and the world around you. So, back to the dog, but this time, you're mindful, and aware that you are afraid of dogs, and have taken strides to remedy this.\n\nYour friend approaches with the dog, and your brain triggers the same process, and floods itself with fear inducing biochemicals. This time however, you're more aware of what you're feeling in the present moment. You recognize you're feeling a bit apprehensive the dog approaches, and you react by taking a few deep breaths, and calming yourself down. The dog is now within biting range. Your fear spikes. This time however, you notice this; and instead of unconsciously reacting to that fear and freezing up, you take an extra second to think, and you remember that dogs can sense tension, and that can trigger dogs to become aggressive. So, instead of freezing, you relax your muscles and slowly back away. This time the dog stays docile, in it's place, and more importantly, *not with it's teeth in your arm.*\n\nDo you see how \"you\" changed your perspective, and influenced the world around you at the same time? You realized the dog wasn't actually a threat if you acted a certain way, and the dog did not react. And now the next time you come in close contact with a dog, the fear response won't be as bad because of the new information you just taught it through mindfulness. Which hypothetically look something like, \"Dog = *~~threat~~* ok if I'm relaxed = ~~FEAR~~ caution\".\n\n...And that's how one would apply mindfulness to change their circumstances. Just apply it to negative self-talk, or negative feelings that arise from anticipating the outcome of a date, etc. All you have to do is sit down, get comfortable, and pay attention. Every day, for at least 5 minutes a day to start with. Just remember *if you don't stick with it, you'll loose it.* Rapidly, too.\n\nIt will also make you a better listener, improve your overall focus, is a great way to relieve stress, along with the physical symptoms of anxiety. It also helps to help manage anxiety itself. As a matter of fact, I used something similar to mindfulness to self-cure my panic attacks. Twice, actually. It went into remission for a few years, came back, and I dealt with it again. It wasn't easy, but I did it. No attacks for a couple years now..\n\nI'm gonna include a link to a talk by a man named, \"Sam Harris\". The whole thing is *very* valuable and worth investing the hour or so it takes to watch it, but he also teaches the audience (and by proxy, me and you) how to perform mindfulness meditation. It's somewhere towards the 3/4 mark of the video I think? That, or near the end. \n\nI hope I was able to inspire you a little, and not just come across like some fake Guru with all the answers who just likes to hear himself talk. Good luck OP but don't worry, you won't need luck. All you need; is you.\n\nAlso, if you want to ask any questions, any at all (including criticisms) feel free to dm me any time, standing offer. ...and hell, if you actually try it out, dm me too. I just started doing it myself, and I like the idea of having a few \"meditation buddies\" to chat and exchange experiences and questions with.

To those who say they can\u2019t find a life partner because they\u2019re ugly, catch this: I\u2019m definitely not Brad Pitt but I used to be a print model. Not an \u201cInstagram model\u201d like every Tom, Dick, and Harry, but a professional signed to an agency. I worked out of Los Angeles while going to school, and here and there beyond. I\u2019m retired from modeling and in a white collar profession that\u2019s thought to be lucrative with prestige and ... I\u2019m totally alone. My father got sick over 3 years ago with what would turn out to be a terminal illness. My girlfriend of a number of years \u2014 someone I was very serious about \u2014 dumped me because she knew my involvement with my dad\u2019s care would be tremendously time consuming. She was right. Anyway, I haven\u2019t touched another human in a romantic way since then. Want to hear something funny? I was at the dentist the other day and my female dentist touched my shoulder and it really affected me. Not in a sexual, perverted way. I can\u2019t explain it. It was impactful though. I had forgotten what it was like to be touched by a non-relative. Pretty sad. These days I basically work, run a lot of errands, tend to my father. My recreation is walking the dog and sleeping. Covid has been horrific for anyone who\u2019d like to date and doesn\u2019t use apps. Last Saturday I spent the entire day and evening sitting with my father. hydrating him, feeding him, grooming him, all those routine things we take for granted that he can\u2019t do anymore. We listed to music. I wanted him to feel human and a little bit alive. Then I looked in the mirror and saw myself and I looked like hell. Exhausted, like I\u2019d crawled out of a dumpster. I\u2019m shy but before Covid I could get phone numbers. But the women \u2014 the same ones who seem to complain about how hard it is to find a good man \u2014 always ghost me after a few texts. And no, I\u2019m not saying anything weird. I just think people are ... people. I reflect back on college and I had a group of 10 friends from my first week on campus. Many years later, I\u2019m the only one unmarried and without a family. I\u2019d say the odds of it happening for me are around 10-20% at best, and dwindling extraordinarily rapidly",

There is a reason why people should date for a while and then get engaged for a while. Every step is to see if the person is a relationship material and will stay that way.\n\nI am very sorry your girlfriend broke your heart. What a coward by breaking up with you thru email. Take time to grieve but realize that you also dodged a bullet. Count yourself lucky she wasn\u2019t married to you or had kids with you.\n\nJust as there is toxic masculinity, there is toxic femininity. It isn\u2019t being spoken about because too many women fall for the propaganda that women can do no wrong and men should always be blamed. A lot of men fall for this too and end up being used and thrown to the curb. This propaganda is used by women who refuse to take responsibility when they are involved in something that goes wrong, and demand men to be the ones to shoulder the burden. It makes a relationship with women like that unsustainable.\n\nThere are desirable traits that both men and women deserve to have in a partner because otherwise we might as well just date forever. Some people are fun to date but unsuitable for marriage. A long term true partner is one who is a giver, not demanding, reasonable, responsible for her own choices, not needy, emotionally balanced, collaborative, and knows how to cope during crises without resorting to drastic measures like breaking up or looking for a new man. Basically, if she is unwilling to treat you the way you treat her, this is a red flag.\n\nSigns that make a woman not qualified: women who go for short term gratification, who is not supportive of your hardship, who is bossy and demanding, who is unreasonable, who cannot have a civil discussion and collaborate over a disagreement, who treats you like a tool for her convenience, etc.\n\nI offer this advice because men and women should be a team, not battle against each other. If we all know how to find better partners, we will all be happier. You just have to vet them properly next time and do not settle. If your gf asks to come back in the future, do not fall for it. She has disqualified herself. Never give anyone another chance to hurt you. Forgive, let go, and require the right qualities in a partner before committing.",

I have had maybe 4 or 5 girlfriends over the years, but none of them lasted more than a few months. So try going 46 years with no real relationships and see what that does to you. I have been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Imagine that. I know I will never ever find anyone. I just keep hoping she will return, as I live in my fantasy world. I am so distraught over her it's not even funny. I love her more than life itself I even have her in my Will she gets everything I own worth over 1.5 million.\n\nSo you are still young enough to still find some one. I, on the other hand have 3 strikes against me, (maybe more) I'm old, short, and ugly.....no one wants me.",

Now I know I want kids of my own. But while I have no trouble starting a relationship, is keeping it alive where I suck at. I'm quite the boring guy who sticks to a routine of work then home then bed. I hate doing outdoors activities and a life of watching movies at home and the ocasional restaurant or cinema outing seems to kill my relationships at the 2nd year threshold. Maybe bc I mainly got involved with younger women who love doing a lot of stuff but idk. I just know I'm faithful and dependable, but It's hard for me to believe that I bore my relationships to death.",

I want my intimate moments to be with someone dear and special, not someone who can just easily leave me.\n\nI hear your struggle. I'm the same in the sense that I'm the only one in my friend circle who hasn't found anyone. It seems that all the girls have found my other bros attractive and the ladies pass me up. I'm not ugly. I'm not Ryan Reynolds or Chris Hemsworth but I'm not ugly either. It's not like I'm not social, I can be pretty extroverted when I need to be and I'd say I have a pretty good sense of humor. I'm halfway through medical school so I'm on the path to a good career as a doctor. I do my own chores and I pay my own bills.\n\nI guess when it comes to relationships, one thing that's different about me is that I don't ask girls out just because they're attractive. There are many attractive women in the world... so what? Can she and I vibe together? Can there be even enough common ground to have a basic friendship? Is she kind? So I need to have these questions answered to an extent before I even ask her out on a date.\n\nI've been burned in the past by falling too quickly for someone and if anything, I refuse to be someone's second choice or last resort.\n\nPlus as a man, it's already harder to know if people find me attractive or nice or not. Because men are just taught to not need approval and just not be phased by anything. No one compliments men so I have to live off my own esteem.\n\nYou're not alone, OP. :) We're all here with you.",

But it's something I'm ok with now. I don't long for it anymore, no more nights up wracking my brain about \"what's wrong with me\".\n\nI get lots of the \"you'll find someone someday, don't give up\".. But I'm not worried about it. I'm not the worst looking guy, and I see some pretty rancid people (both appearance and personality wise) finding love in places so I do believe that there is somebody out there for everybody, but I also believe that it's not something that happens for everyone. For my own part I am not out there to be found, nor looking, so I should not expect something to fall into my lap.\n\nDunno if it helps to know ur not alone spiritually, sorry about talkin a lot about me here.

Because of the virus dating and meet ups are harder for everyone i'm sure. So there are many people in the same boat, wanting a child free partner or one to have children with, and wanting friends but are instead lonely.\n\n I'm mostly an introvert but i like burning man events and festivals and dances but i barely have any friends, so yeah. anyways being extroverted and attractive definitely helps on the path of finding a partner! :)",

Just like the recurring theme on here I am left wondering did I do this to myself? All my friends are either in long term relationships or engaged, I on the other hand have never even kissed anyone. Not like it matters anyways. Like you stated I too have great friends, a great life and excluding the occasional days of despair I am generally happy. Still looking around I wish I had someone even though it is all my fault I know, unlike you I don't put myself out there. My family always made fun of my look growing up so I have next to zero confidence- still I know this myself it's just an excuse. I am throwing myself on this path and maybe even secretly want to feel the hurt and the pain of being alone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for hijacking your post OP I didn't mean to rant on about myself. If you consider yourself attractive and successful- aka happy with who you are. Maybe give some people-you normally wouldn't- the chance and see where that takes you. I recently got in writing letters to pen pals (there's a subreddit and also apps like Slowly) and while it doesn't take away the loneliness it provides you with a new hobby and just a different prospective on getting to know someone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish you the best of luck OP :)",

            "comment": "You're only 32, there's plenty of time. The best loves come from not looking at all. I see that you said you're not looking for a typical douche bag looking guy, the thing is, when alot of people meet \"the one\", they don't look like the hot person they envisioned marrying. The person's personality is what turns them into the most beautiful and attractive person there is. My love of loves was definitely not a guy who would turn multiple women's heads, but his personality, made him hot, attractive and desirable. I'm not saying you have to dramatically lower your standards, we need something that's also physically attractive in our partners, but it just doesn't seem that we marry our fantasy partners. For the 10 other guys you dated that only a few you had somewhat feelings for, but they didn't have enough feelings for you and were honest to not lead you on, aren't you happy they were honest? Aren't you happy you're not stuck with them and children? Most people lead people on or are just plain mean. I would hope that you would feel releaved that you didn't end up marrying one of these men just because they looked good. Getting married just for the sake of marriage would end up in a very unhappy life and marriage. Marraige is a huge commitment. Your entire life changing to devout yourself for this person, and your children, even if you divorced, you'd still communicate because of the kids brought into this unhappy marraige. Don't you want to spend the rest of your life with someone that truly loves you, and you them? I'm sure in your thoughts you want a happy marriage. You don't want to settle, so girl, take your time, relax, don't fret about being single just because your friends are married. You'll get yours, and when you do, it will be worth the wait",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m a 39M with a blended family of 8 total. Custody of the kids is shared 50/50. I\u2019m really looking for someone who I can go have a beer with, watch sports with, shoot pool with. I know people from work that I\u2019ve hung out with before outside of work but usually me suggesting things. I never had a best friend growing up, I\u2019m just so lonely. I have nowhere to go when I\u2019m fighting with my wife. I\u2019ve had some depression moments is maybe why I don\u2019t have any close friends \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

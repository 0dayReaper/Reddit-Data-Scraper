    "postText": "I graduated PhD today, and it was the hardest thing I have ever done. So many times I wanted to quit but somehow I pulled through. \n\nToday is graduation day. Even with covid everyone is celebrating, in town, back home, online, with family, friends, loved ones, and advisors saying profusely nice things. Mine doesn't even care. All my friends and family are thousands of miles away. I've been cooped up on my own since covid started, wrote a dissertation I am truly proud of, lined up a great job, but for the first time this year I broke down. \n\nI am so alone in the world. I am so lonesome I could cry.\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone. Your replies are so heartwarming they brought a big smile to my face. To all the graduates, congrats we made it.",

COVID cancelled my grad ceremony, grad trips, and all of of the fanfare i expected and I had a hard time feeling genuinely happy and proud about by BSN until recently, almost 1 year into the job. Remember that not being able to celebrate it does not make your PhD any less of a monster achievement and that you know it will be worth it in the end!!!",

So there I was, 2 days after christmas in the office for the credits, a lot of couples, families gathered to receive the pappers of their credits. I was the only single person there. I had a new house, but no girlfriend or family to share it. It was supposed to be one of the happiest days of my life. Its was one of the saddest.",

I got transferred across the country, and it seems like there's a long term plan for me. I'm stuck having to prove myself a bit more to upper management in lieu of formal education. I'm making progress every day though. I'd love to be able to share success with someone else in my life, and have a partner to navigate the obstacles with.\n\nCongratulations on your achievement. Hopefully you can score some type of research job in order to start putting that knowledge to use in a practical/profitable way.",

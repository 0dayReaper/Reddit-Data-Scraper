When we are in a relationship when we have a title attached to it we have certain expectations per se. We think that everything's going to be okay now. Get our vision of what our relationship should be may not be the same as what our partners is what we want desire out of the relationship may not be the same as for our partner does.\n\nSo we have to let them know how we feel so they can understand and help us, with the expectations we have. Also they can share what they have as their expectations so we can kind of find a happy median.",

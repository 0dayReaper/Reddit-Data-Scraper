    "postText": "i think i was born defective. everyone always ends up leaving me - in the beginning, it was because i was a massive asshole. that was my own fault, and so i started going to therapy to work on myself so i wouldnt hurt more people with my words and actions. i thought i was doing well, but i guess not, considering that i'm alone again. im not perfect, i make mistakes, but i've done my best to apologize and make up for them.\n\nyesterday, all of my friends canceled on me, two without notice and one who flaked to go hang out with someone else. i don't understand what i'm doing wrong. i was toxic at one point, but i've ceased in those tendencies. however, that doesn't seem to matter because no matter how hard i work, i always end up alone. i know i'm not entitled to anyone's time nor friendship, but it just...kinda hurts. there has to be something fundamentally wrong with me, but i don't know what it is. im so tired of it.",

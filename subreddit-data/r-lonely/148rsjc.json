The last couple of years have been really hard for me, lots has happened, both good and bad. \n\nI\u2019ve been struggling a lot lately with being lonely, working long hours, single, not much family to speak of who all have their own lives. \n\nI just really would love someone to talk to, share experiences with, cook a meal with and even just to not wake up alone in this house. Like tonight, I\u2019ve just wanted to speak to someone but instead I just sit here and overthink things, I don\u2019t want it to be like that but I also feel a bit stuck and don\u2019t know what to do about it even though I\u2019m so done with this. It\u2019s just been me for 8 years and I\u2019m not even 30 at this point just yet.\n\nI\u2019ve always just worked on myself and my job, having a nice house etc but what is the point in having lovely things if you can\u2019t share them with anyone. I just feel the void for company getting bigger and I need to tackle it before it gets too much. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions or feedback for how they keep busy. \n\nI\u2019m not one to sleep around with girls having them here, I\u2019m just looking to keep busy with a new focus or something. To be honest I\u2019m really not sure of what I want. \n\nAnyway thanks for reading!",

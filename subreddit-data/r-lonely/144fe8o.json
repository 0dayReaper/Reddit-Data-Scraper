It\u2019s your birthday but no one\u2019s there to celebrate you.  matter of fact I forgot my own birthday this year.\n\nI hade Minor surgery few years ago. I hade do it everything my own after the operation. My friend came to take me home after the operation.if it isn\u2019t for him I wouldn\u2019t be here.\n\nI had a leg problem last year couldn\u2019t walk for months had to do it everything with that one leg. \n\nThis is why live alone sucks. All the people who says having a partner is no big deal and being single is amazing. They never lived alone for long time before and they probably got really large friends group and loving family to fall back on.",

It\u2019s *a lot* easier to want to be single when you can date/hook up with anyone within reason. \n\nOther than that, it\u2019s most likely just a simple case of wanting what you don\u2019t have. Everyone struggles with this from time to time.",

Nothing replaces that companionship, and to be honest I get sick and tired of my only companion being myself. \ud83e\udd74",

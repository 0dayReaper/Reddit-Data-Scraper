This is because, and no amount of angry responses shall change this, men have it harder than women when it comes to finding a spouse.  That is an objective fact. Men struggle more. All of this sub is men looking for women. Women have it easier my friend. They always will. They don't have it 'easy', but they have it 'easier'. That is objective my friend. I dont have any advice for you honestly, my friend. Not sure what to say,",

It\u2019s pointless here because the vast majority of people on here have something they want and hanging a lonely sign on it doesn\u2019t make it more desirable. This is mostly 15-30 year olds or only fans, or equivalent, sex workers, or people into certain things wanting to learn stuff. You sound bitter which doesn\u2019t help. Look I\u2019m sorry your lonely, it stinks and this world can be hard at times but your just at the wrong place to get what you seem to need",

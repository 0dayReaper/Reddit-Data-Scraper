I got \u201cdisinvited\u201d (?) from a trip a work colleague was planning because her friends weren\u2019t too comfortable having a stranger around (justifiable tbh). One person I\u2019ve met via hinge who has become a very good friend (I don\u2019t know what lies ahead for us) is in a depressive zone so he\u2019s keeping to himself. So basically, I have no plans, it absolutely sucks to not have anyone beside you when the world is celebrating with their loved ones - affects me so much only because this day shows how lonely you really are, as you\u2019re not someone\u2019s default. You don\u2019t come first. And that sucks. So basically, imma eat lots of food, drink some alcohol and take my (prescribed) sleeping pills and lie down listening to a sleep podcast so my eyes and brains are shut tight even before any countdown begins.",

I\u2019m not sure why. Maybe it\u2019s because I have no one. I have no friends close by and everyone else seems to have someone to share the evening/night/day/whatever with. \n\nI\u2019ll get through it. Always do.

About half a day later (on NYE) he texted me and asked, if I wanted something. \n\nLike man, couldn't you just pick up the call?",

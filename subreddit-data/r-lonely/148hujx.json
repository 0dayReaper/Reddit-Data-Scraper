    "postText": "This afternoon I saw cute girl at the cafeteria and decided to go up to her and talk. I'm an international student so I asked about the food she was eating and some more food recommendations to continue the conversation. She seemed to take an interest in the conversation, so I thought I am gonna ask her out and I was prepared to take a \"No\" for an answer. Infact, based on my previous experiences - I have considered the default answer as \"No\". I specifically said \"I wanted to ask.. respectfully... If you would like to have coffee with me sometime\". Turns out, she indeed said \"ahhh... Maybe no... Sorry\". \n\nThe thing is. I don't have a problem with this girl. I have approached several women before (respectfully, of course). But right now, these rejections are taking a serious toll on both my mental health and self esteem. Earlier I'd consider myself a 7/10 and doubt whether I'm an 8... Now I even wonder if I'm a 3.. 4 or even a 1? I don't exactly understand what is the problem with me ? Am I really that unattractive? Am I not worthy of any love at all ? All I want is a cute, understanding girlfriend for whom I'd cook, invest time and share my values and learn from her at the same time. Is it too much to ask for ? It's just breaking my heart at this point and I'm questioning my existence. I really just want to be left alone now.",

It's not about what you can do for her as much as it is what you can do for yourself. From my experience, most women like guys who are confident, funny, carefree yet serious, honest, and loyal. Most of my female friends are incredibly attractive, yet I don't ever hit on them because of my loyalty to my wife. They respect that. \n\nIt's a lot of hit and miss, but when you get a hit, make it a home run. If you want to dm me, I'm free.",

            "comment": "She knows nothing about you. You just met her. Most people aren't comfortable going on dates with people they just met. You should have just asked to sit with her and had a conversation and then asked for her number/socials, or waited until the next time you saw her to talk to her again and then ask for her number/social media. Then after you become acquainted you can ask her out on a date. If a person just started talking to me then immediately asked me out I'd feel really uncomfortable and suspicious, wondering if there was an underlying motive. Plus I'd just feel like I have no reason to want to go out with a stranger, I don't even know whether I like them or not, whether they seem nice or not.",

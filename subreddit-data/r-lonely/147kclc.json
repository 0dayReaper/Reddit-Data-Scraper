I didn't realize it until I had a hug from my mother after a time period I can't recall going without. It's not even sexual in nature, we're social mammals and have the need for contact. On a side note I often wonder how different I might be if I had it in the three months after being cut out (2 month preme) even though there's not much to be gained from the thought. Skin to skin or any physical contact is important for babies as well as adults. Hope you find someone to cuddle with. *Edit: was three not two in the NICU, I think?",

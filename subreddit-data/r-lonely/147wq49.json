    "postText": "i have a boyfriend, but he\u2019s always out with his friends and he barely has time for me. when he does, it\u2019s doing something he likes or just having me tag along with him and his friends. i don\u2019t know when the last time he asked me to hang out one on one was. when he does ask me to hang out, it\u2019s either because he needs me for something, or no one else is available. i have school friends, but i don\u2019t hang out with them outside of school. summer just started and i\u2019ve spent the first week inside by myself. i just want somebody to want to talk to me first. i have really bad social anxiety about making plans first, whenever i do the plans always go wrong, and my boyfriend is the only person i\u2019m comfortable asking to hang out first, but like i said before, he\u2019s always with his friends. i just want a consistent friend who will talk to me first sometimes and relate to me. i feel like i\u2019m wasting away being so lonely and miserable.",

I prefer quieter places and hardly anyone about.\n\nI do question why your bf isn't tryin to just have time for you, even just sitting and watching TV or something?",

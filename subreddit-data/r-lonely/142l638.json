I\u2019m required to have relationships at work. It got so bad that my work was hindering. I\u2019d go home and just kind of becoming nonexistent from the world. \n\nThen my mom saw me one day and knew that something was terribly wrong. She told me to call her. She started talking to me and asking me questions about what I\u2019ve been going through. I started ranting about how alone I feel and asked her what the hell I\u2019d do if she were gone? \n\nCLICK. \n\nIt clicked. What would I do? Why was I worried about her being gone? I was afraid of her being gone. I was afraid of everyone being gone. \n\nOkay, so I\u2019m afraid of loss, abandonment, the disappearance of my loved ones. Now what? \n\nCLICK. \n\nIsolating and detachment from others makes it easier if you lose them. Getting used to being alone without relying on others sets you up for success when they are inevitably gone. \n\nIt\u2019s a coping mechanism brought on by abandonment trauma, that I didn\u2019t even fully realize was going on.",

I don't ask anyone for there time anymore and I expect absolutely nothing from females. It doesn't have to be this way I've been forced to realize over the past few years. I have pushed some absolutely fantastic human beings away from me because I'm to broken to trust anymore. I realize now that's me doing this has really hurt some truly deserving ladies. In the end this has been completely my fault and I know it. You gonna have to open yourself up to find someone. Otherwise you'll end up a neurotic mess like me.",

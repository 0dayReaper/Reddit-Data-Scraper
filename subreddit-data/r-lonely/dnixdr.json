    "postText": "Throwaway because my main account is for positivity and nothing personal:\n\nI am a 72 year old female who just found out I have stomach cancer.\n\nMy whole life I worked as a neurosurgeon and spent my youth and up until my early forties, going through school and trying to become the very best medical doctor.\n\nI never had kids, was way to busy to marry, and only even had any definition by my career title.\n\nMy life was based on my career and focusing on helping others. It wasn't until my 70s did I realize that all of my family is dead and I never had friends. I had collegues and coworkers, but never any friends. Even as a child, I was always the \"lone\" wolf.\n\nI retired 5 years ago and loved my party. It was awesome having people say goodbye and feeling included. But after that, no one checked up on me or even said anything to me after that day. \n\nMy family like mother, father, siblings, died many years ago. It's now just me.\n\nI realized I worked myself to death and never had a life. Never went on any trips, never met a wonderful man and had children. It was always just me and my patients.\n\nNow that I am dying, I really have nothing left. Most people wouldn't want an older friend or romantic partner, and if they do, I now have to worry about them wanting me for my money as I am a multimillionaire.\n\nTo the people reading: Meet people. Most of you are young. Put family and friends first. And live your life more than your career.",

All of those people you helped to give their life back.\n\nJust because no one will be at your funeral does not mean that you haven\u2019t made an impact on people\u2019s lives. You are incredible and if I knew you in \u2018real life\u2019, I would be there.\n\nIt\u2019s never too late. There are people out there who care. I don\u2019t know if you are religious ( I\u2019m not ) but it might help if you speak to a hospital chaplain. Just a suggestion? They are brilliant at what they do.\n\nAll the very best to you, thank you for service x",

When I was little, my dad went in for a risky brain surgery, and if it wasn\u2019t for the skill of the neurosurgeon and the compassion of the nurses, my life and his might have looked very different. As it is, I had a wonderful man to look up to, who taught me how to be smart and compassionate and curious.\n\nI\u2019m sure this must be scary, but I hope you reach out to church groups, cancer support groups, anything. It\u2019s never too late to make friends. Call an old coworker or three you liked, write letters. You have done amazing things, and you deserve to have some comfort.\n\nI wish you the best.

I remember this one lady, she was in poor health, probably about 80 years old, and when I tried to give her a small Christmas ornament as a gift, she gave it back to me, and I don't remember exactly what she told me, but it was something along the lines of how I should keep it to remembe her and how good it is to share happiness with other people. I am sure she passed soon after, and I swear to you I could never forget that. I keep that ornament around all year, and every time I look at it or move it or touch it I think about her.\n\njust know that while the isolation may be local, it's not long distance.\n\nI like spending time at my animal shelter, it's a really great place with a lot of volunteers, staff, amazing dogs and cats and rabbits, and in my case a reform program for the county jail. have you the ability to do this?",

            "comment": "The hardest hitting posts on this sub are from people in their twilight years lamenting that they have nothing left and nothing to look forward to. But these posts are usually written introspectively: they only focus on their wants and needs from their own perspective, which insinuates they might be lonely for a good reason. But your post is a refreshing change as you're focusing on others, and instead of having a whinge looking for commiseration you're offering wholesome advice. It honestly sounds like most of your unhappiness stems from being too selfless earlier in life.\n\nWhile things might not look so rosy for you now please remember that doesn't at all mean you haven't lived a meaningful life, or for that matter have spent most of your life unhappily. Can you think of many professions which have improved the lives of others as much as yours? I can't. Most people live selfishly, never contributing to society in any meaningful way. You've already improved society magnitudes more than most people. If someone like you hasn't lived a meaningful and fulfilling life I don't know who has.\n\nI often worry I'm destined towards a fate similar to yours. Do you mind me asking why you never met a wonderful man to have children with? Any advice on what could've helped you find someone in your late 20s / early 30s? Advice on what could've helped someone find someone like you when younger?\n\n&gt; I now have to worry about them wanting me for my money as I am a multimillionaire.\n\nHave you had a look at /r/fatfire? Great sub for smart people with serious money planning for or wondering what to do in retirement.\n\n&gt; To the people reading: Meet people. Most of you are young. Put family and friends first. And live your life more than your career.\n\nIt seems doctors consistently say they wish they had more time and don't care about the money. Some of my smartest friends from school went to med school, had to work horrible conditions as junior doctors, unsuccessfully tried for several years to get into a specialist area like neurosurgery, and eventually quit medicine altogether. And these are exceptionally smart, good caring people, exactly the kind of people who should be doctors, and now most of them work towards making selfish old men richer. They all said that getting into these specialist areas is impossible as the specialists themselves are the gatekeepers and they don't want competition or the hassle of training up their replacements. It seems crazy that all these doctors work such insane hours and are miserable for it, don't know what to do with all their money, patients suffer through worse healthcare and skyrocketing costs, and countless good young people are denied a fulfilling career.\n\nDo you agree with much of this? Perhaps in your final years you could find happiness and fulfillment in helping more people get into med school or become specialist doctors? Or otherwise improve the lives of young doctors, letting them pursue a family and life outside of work? Maybe do something like contribute towards the creation of a new med school or specialist college? Write up some amazing neurosurgery content on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery) or similar? Lobby for policies to improve healthcare / structural changes to the medical industry? Help build or plan for new homes to put downward pressure on house prices, so more young people can go live their lives? Offer to assist with the childcare of young doctors' children?\n\nPlease remember that if you want to pursue such endeavors you need to pursue them yourself. As it sounds like you understand, a happy and fulfilling life without loneliness seldom comes looking for you - you need to stay busy and keep proactively looking for it.\n\nGood luck, and thank you for all you've given society.",

It made me very different from most of people, so finding a kindred soul was always obviously unlikelly for me. So i kind of got used to the single life. I always thought it would be wonderfull to have a family but now it seems its increasingly impossible for me in this state of mind. If i wanted to change that i would have to willfully erase who i was up to this point, and that feals like not being me any more.  \n\nSo my question to you is: If you where regreting your descission to live your life the way you did, would you in your realisation change yourself 100% to be that witch can facilitate the life you wish you had, would that not mean you wouldnt be you any more? \n\nIm still young at this point to know what the right choice is so im not sure what to do about it.\n\nP.S.

If it wasn\u2019t for my surgeons I would not be alive. The amount of schooling and dedication to their craft helps others immensely. A neurosurgeon, brain md is simply amazing. The human brain is capable of so much. I hope you find solace. Sending internet hugs your way during this crazy time.\nI will take your advice to heart. Thank you again!",

My doctor was the most kind supportive doctor and I still remember our entire conversation in the operating room as he tried to calm me down. He also gave my a discount of 30% because I was in uni. \n\nHe was an incredibly kind man and I was very upset when I found out he had died. And had I not been concerned it was inappropriate i would have gone to his funeral. I share this little story to say that you will absolutely be mourned and your life has meant a lot to all of your patients. \n\nIf you still have some mobility enjoy the time you have on a fabulous cruise or train tour. You can meet lots of people that way and they don\u2019t need to find out how much money you have. Or go on ultra lavish trips where everyone has their own money.",

We have been to 4 different hospitals in the past month. \n\nAt our last pit stop, the ambulance arrived too late for his emergency ablation, and the doctor went home. He waited hours for us, missing us by minutes at 10:30pm. My brother got him on the phone and begged him to come back, even yelling at the man at one point. Somebody dropped the ball during the hospital transfer, and the new doc thought my father was in much better shape than he was.\n\nSure enough, after my dad\u2019s nurse updated the doc on my dad\u2019s fragile condition (back-to-back vtach attacks), the doc came back in and worked furiously to stabilize my dad until 4AM. He was the only specialist in town who could help my dad. My dad would have died if the doc had not come back in, and I am so grateful for his work, but I have to wonder how often stuff this happens. Doctors are only human. They need sleep like the rest of us mere mortals. We demand so much because the stakes are so high, but it seems like too much pressure for anyone to handle.",

            "comment": "So much this.\n\nThis can happen even when you aren't pursuing a successful career. I've let fear dictate to me who I am and what I do since I was a babe. My father instilled a fear of the world in me so great that I never pursued my dreams. I used to paint and write for the love of it, but because my parents were poor and neglectful, I turned my beautiful hobby into a career choice in order to move away from home. But all that ended up happening was I made myself hate my passions. Everything I painted or wrote was for the eyes of someone else, and people's eyes are critical, so I stopped entirely.\n\nI just managed to get married, but almost threw the opportunity away because I was afraid of committing to someone my entire life. I didn't think I could do it and was afraid I would hurt them. I've wanted kids since I was nine years old but I'm very possibly facing a future without them as my marriage was impulsive and my spouse is very hesitant to have them with someone like me, who still struggles just to get herself to leave the house.\n\nFamily and community, including children, are the most important aspects of life, but I've squandered so much of mine worrying about making mistakes or how others might judge me. I've wasted career and family opportunities, and have damaged people around me through desperate fear-based actions and paranoid delusions of their intentions for me. Cooped up in my house with no one to see and only my spouse to talk to, I feel like a shell of a person.\n\nThat you managed to help people is wonderful, but I feel what you're saying. I could have absorbed myself in my passion, too. Or I could have done what I did; either way, I would have been where I am at now. This is what some people call being in a \"spiritual crises,\" which I realize now is never having cared for my emotional self. I feel left out of and uninvolved in everything, because that's how I carefully fabricated my life.\n\nCareer success means nothing. Money can't buy psycho-emotional wellbeing. We have to be willing to take the risk of \"losing everything\" in order to give ourselves the things we need. Family and community, showing love, and fulfilling a role in your community are the most valuable endeavors we can take.\n\nSince that is the case, maybe it isn't too late for either of us? I know a chemistry teacher, and she grows very attached to her students. They treat her like family and they rely on her wisdom, sometimes even for personal matters. I don't know what timeline you have, but maybe you can briefly teach future med students what you know, and deftly guide them away from making the decisions you made? There are a lot of kids out there who are caving to the extreme pressure of going through medical school and filling their heads with the idea that their work is now going to be their life. I bet they could use a kind teacher like you to help shake them loose and remind them that they're still human.\n\nEven if your time with them was short, the impact could last their lifetime.\n\nI wish you the very best. Also, not everybody doesn't want an older friend. I've been looking for a \"mom\" figure my whole life. There are plenty of people who are, even if they don't state it.",

Continue your forward actions while avoiding connecting to your memory. Many of us have already shown that we care and are with you in spirit. Many people have had everything you haven't, and it hasn't brought them much joy. At this point, forget about intellectual dissections and simply believe you lived your life. I will be thinking of you. Amen.",

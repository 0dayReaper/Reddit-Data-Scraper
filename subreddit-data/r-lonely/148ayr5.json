    "postText": "I live in a small village, all I do is work then home. Becoming annoying. no one really knows how lonely I am. I\u2019m getting to the point where I\u2019m talking to myself to soothe the loneliness. It comes in waves. I always have that \u201cblank\u201d facial expression if anyone is from a village, chances are high I\u2019m living they\u2019re and hell with it, f*** everything rn, all I just want to do is just drink. Smoke till I pass. I feel like I made my own hell by living here. Anyways ladies and gents, take care. I\u2019ll be here waiting for you I suppose.",

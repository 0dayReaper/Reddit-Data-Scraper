            "comment": "Hiya,\n\n  \nI hope you realise you are 14, just at the start of your teenage years, you shouldn't beat yourself up because of it, some people go without relationships until their 20's, you have plenty of time! \n\nWhen I was your age I felt similarly since friends at school might have had a girlfriend or two, which I might have been envious of, but looking back on it now I had no reason to. Growing up as a dude comes with lots of trials and tribulations, especially during your teenage years. Don't let this bother you as much as it is!\n\nYou shouldn't base your worth on whether or not you have a romantic partner/girlfriend, instead you should base it off other things be it academics, reliability or whatever you yourself feel you're good at such as hobbies or just general traits. \n\nYour time will come soon enough if you keep putting in the effort, without any hardships be it rejection or otherwise you wont gain any experience at all. Whats important is that when you do get a girlfriend, dont let her become your source of self-worth and love in your life. Otherwise god forbid you break up you will be distraught by believing that you yourself are worthless and unloveable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to DM.\n\nTake care of yourself!",

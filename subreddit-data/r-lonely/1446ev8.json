    "postText": "In high school I dated and had a committed relationship, which is sort of funny to me because I was pretty unbearable back then so the idea of me being attractive to that person is strange lol.  Now as a lonely adult, I have no desire to date. I\u2019ve tried recently with a friend but nothing came of it. \n\nHas this happened to anyone else, and does anyone else feel this way? I feel like all I hear is the reverse. And it\u2019s not like I despise dating or romance or anything, I just can\u2019t bring myself to care. I am not aro/ace either. I don\u2019t want to bother with putting myself out there because of my own personal reasons and I just want to know if this is normal or not, especially for a young adult.",

    "postText": "I did everything the internet have told me to do to feel better. I meditate, I go to GYM, I eat heathy food, I take milk or yogurt as a daily diet, I clean up my bed, bedroom and toilet regularly, I do journaling, create goals and plans and I've accomplished some to most of them, and I still feel sad, lonely and guilty just to be alive. I feel like I'm stuck in a prison and nothing really cheers me except music. But I can't be listening to it 24/7. I don't really have a friend to tell these emotional problems. So, I'm telling them here. What should I do next? I feel lost.",

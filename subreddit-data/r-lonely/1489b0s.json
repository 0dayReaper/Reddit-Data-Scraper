    "postText": "I am in my early 20s and am married to my partner of a few years. \n\nI don't think I have ever felt as alone in my life. \n\nAll of our friends are in very different life stages, and between my own anxiety, navigating my early 20s professionally, and my town, I have realized that I feel desperately alone. \n\nI am someone who comes from a big family that has always been close, but in recent years have been the complete opposite. I grew up with a few close friendships, and I am not sure what has happened, but I no longer feel like the person that they knew. \n\nOverall, I am just lost and ranting and hoping that someone relates to this.",

Affirming with the important people in your life how to remedy those feelings is equally important. You have some answers as to why you feel the way you do, and if you can summon the courage to share them then it becomes possible to seek out solutions to help manage those feelings while looking directly for your input in the changes to be made.",

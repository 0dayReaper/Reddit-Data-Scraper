    "postText": "My family is upper middle class, and we live very comfortably. We aren't millionaires or anything, but we have a pretty big house with 2 stories and a pool. I have my own room and bathroom as well as my own car. My parents are in a happy marriage, they aren't too strict (i mean I've had my frustrations with them but that's normal I think) they are there for me and I have a good relationship with both of them and with my brother. I don't have to deal with much family drama. I'm also white, cis, straight, and nuerotypical. \n\nNone of my friends have all of these privileges. One friend struggles to have good relationships with her parents and doesn't have an escape because she doesn't have a room. Another friend's parents don't support her as she tries to excel academically, so she had to get a job to pay her own school fees. Other friends are gay or trans and have difficulty coming out to their families and have to deal with family drama all the time. Some of them have religious families that have induced religious trauma on them as well (my family is not religious at all). Some others have divorced parents and have to move back and forth all the time. \n\nI'm always a little embarrassed of my cushioned life when I first meet people. I feel like I often get close to them until they feel comfortable coming to me for advice or to vent about the issues I listed above. I support them in the ways I know how and they tell me I make them feel better. But once they find out what my house looks like, I feel like there becomes this distance. Recently I've fallen out of touch with several of my close friends and I fear this is the reason. \n\nI go back and forth between two reactions to this. The first is that I dramaticize the problems I do have because I want to be supported the way I try to support others. This works in the short term but I always feel incredibly guilty for it afterwards because I can't validate my own problems and I feel as though I'm making them up for attention. Also I feel like it widens the distance between me and my friends when they realize I actually have nothing to complain about. I realize this is immature and selfish and when I stopped doing this I reacted by working as much as possible and not allowing myself to have fun. For a year I was either at school, at work, doing homework or asleep. I didn't even let myself have a lunch break - I worked through that too, in the school kitchen handing lunches out to others. That was how I met my friend who was there trying to pay her own school fees, whom I have so much respect for. I felt guilty back then too, because I didn't really need the job or the money, and I thought maybe I should've given the opportunity to someone who needed it more. \n\nIn the end I just forgot how to socialize. A few of my classmates invited me to parties and things and I felt so awkward. Socializing and having fun felt so _foreign_, I didn't know how to relate to my friends or participate in games. Now school is out and I have so much time to myself, even though I still have a job. I just feel so hollow now.",

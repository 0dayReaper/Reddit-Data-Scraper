    "postText": "When I was a teenager I was a lonly and socially active kid , I had friends was involved in activities, went to concerts conventions, had hobbies , I never found love or even a fling , high school came and went,  all my friends were actively dating , I wasn't,  I approached so many girls in high school at the concerts.\nI would go to a gathering, usually a mall back then , all my friends would leave with a phone number and hook up , I was always the odd man out , the messed up part is I wasn't fat wasn't ugly wasn't shy , I even in my last year of high school was working out , I was rocking a six pack back then , still never even once was able to gain  experience in the art of women, \nIt's all trial and error you learn buy failure and buy success,  I never had success so I only knew what not to do which was everything I ever done, \nI got frustrated around the age of 21, all my friends abandoned me they said I was making them feel awkward,  because I was cursed or something because they saw how much I tried they saw I wasn't doing a single thing differently then them , they say I looked the same as them if not better,  and I would constantly strike out,  \nEventually they stopped inviting me out , and avoided me,  \nMy twentys was very lonely,  I worked and came home weekends I would try to do things but felt like a creepy being the only guy showing up to events alone,  then the internet was borne,  the portal to the world,  I was one of the first few thousand to sign up for most huge singles sights and for a few was one of the first few hundred,  months became years,  years became decades, now at 52 I still have no one, \nI not asked for advice because I tried everything so many times it's insane,  yes even tried not trying,  tried being myself,  tried changing everything about myself nothing ever worked, now at 52 I can say I am NOT a crazy horny guy who hate women , nor blames them for not wanting me , \nI have physical needs that where never met,  my body hungers for something it's cat even fantasize about,  because it has no experience to base it on , I don't long for romance or love , my body longs for something it's never has had , it's like dying from starvation while the entire world feast like fat people at a buffet and you can't even get scraps. When I was a teenager I was told it would get better,  when I was 21 I was told I had to work hard to get it , I worked so damn hard,  at 30 I was told I was working to hard to get it, so I was more patient and just lived,  nothing happened at 40 I was told try harder again so I did , boldly going where I haven't gone before,  still nothing at 50 I realized it's to damn late , I gave up, but the hunger only gets worse,  the emptiness loneliness is worse than ever. But now I don't have time nor my youth I don't have my whole life ahead of me,  only decades of loneliness and failed attempts behind me . I am alone  I just want to be not alone for even a short time,  I failed at even that so no for some things didn't get better",

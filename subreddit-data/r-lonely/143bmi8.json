    "postText": "Hello everyone, I am Annie. I am sorry to report that my boyfriend and I have broken up. The reason is that he cheated.\r  \n\r  \nWe have been together for two years. During this time, we have experienced many things and have many good memories. However, recently I found out that he was hooking up with other women behind my back, and even dated some women. I was very disappointed and sad when I found out all this.\r  \n\r  \nI've always thought there was a deep bond between us, and he's always been nice to me. However, his derailment made me unacceptable. I think if a person really loves you, he won't do such a thing to hurt you.\r  \n\r  \nAlthough the breakup was painful, I believe that time will heal everything. I will love myself well and start over with my life. At the same time, I also hope that he can realize his mistakes and correct them.\r  \n\r  \nFinally, what I want to say is that love needs to be maintained by both parties. If there is a problem with one of the parties, it will be difficult for the relationship to continue. Therefore, whether it is a man or a woman, they should remain honest and loyal in love, and cherish each other's feelings.",

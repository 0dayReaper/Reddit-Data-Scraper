That feeling made me feel so alone. But it passed. She was my greatest friend regardless and I\u2019m glad I learned to respect her sexuality. \ud83d\udda4",

I looked at her knees and they were so fleshy, I didn\u2019t like that. Lol It helped. Every time I felt butterflies, I\u2019d remind myself of that or look at them in PE.",

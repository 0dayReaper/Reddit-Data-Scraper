    "postText": "It's that collective subconscious conditional imitation to increase survival that kills me...blind optimism, over projective, feeling infused, idealistic over all even if non-applicable, morph to fit the picture fucking functional, privileged and damaging delusion that gaslights the fuck out of all not blessed by the gods FUCKING ILLUSION lmao just project, project, project. 'I only see hope' when hope is fucking privilege lol....do these people honestly fucking believe everyones the same? Endless abilities and possibilities you can do it too self soothing bs? I'm fucking envious and I hate being this creature. Fuck these ppl lol. Your unintentional, blind collective liars who use narcissistic altruism to enforce the delusion only afforded to you and the few. Nobodies the fucking same. People do not possess the same mental, physical, circumstantial abilities and capabilities to equate to the same fucking result you find yourself blessed delusionally in. And you'll never see it, you'll never understand it. Because all it takes for you is hardwork to overcome for you and the people around you enough to enforce your delusion enough to believe those who don't make it simply haven't tried hard enough. I fucking haaaaaate youuuuu lmao. There's too fucking many of you...when you find people don't fit your delusion you get personally offended lol...FUCK YOU PEOPLE lol you dont know how lucky you are to blissfully be going around with a gavel and fucking crumbs in you hands believing you bring more good than harm. You don't know how lucky you are...lol 'DARKNESS GO AWAYY!' and poof! VOIL\u00c1!...unbelievable",

Even the propensity to be lucky lol all you are to get you into the position to not only be more likely but effective when given is a privilege not all should bet on and blindly aim when what collective experience points to the lesser odds of reaching a degree of success uncharacteristic to the norm. Being the way some people are they'll fuck up a lucky situation or be too fucked up to ever notice they've fucked up...but that's just my opinion. And I'm more so fuck the word and the people in it...I'm too fucking old for this shit all of it lol",

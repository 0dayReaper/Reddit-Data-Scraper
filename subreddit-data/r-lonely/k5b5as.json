Looked at. Admired. \nSmiled at. To laugh with someone. \n\nTo feel safe. Feel like someone\u2019s really got you. \n\nThat\u2019s what we want.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd yeah, sometimes it\u2019s both. \ud83d\ude1e\n\n\nEdit...\nDamn. This really blew up. I posted this because I was missing my best friend and just wanted to send that out into the universe. Thank you all for you feedback. It\u2019s been great reading everything. I hope all of you stay safe and find what you need to be loved and cared for, whatever that means for you.",

We don't want sex *per se*, we want the intimacy it represents. To that point, they're often interchangeable words in context despite it being technically incorrect.",

Never had sex before, but when I was living with my best friend and her boyfriend, hearing them have sex grossed me out and made me super lonely at the same time. Like, how come I can't have anyone to be intimate with?\n\nI ask that, but I know the answer; I've got a damaged self-esteem, and I've been so used to saying that I don't need a boyfriend that I've become used to rejecting anything that sounds like a guy coming onto me.... Which, sadly, has only been older men that try to get with me like I'm some sort of trick on the street... The only time someone had asked me out was this male friend I had in highschool. Problem was, I had a hard crush on some other guy who liked me as a friend (which is another can of emotions that doesn't have to be opened now), so I rejected him and helped him get with one of my friends.\n\nBut I sharply digress.\n\nI used to masturbate because I was horny from the absence of sex; I still do, but it's now mixed with the intent to drown out the overwhelming longing for someone to share intimacy with. It's so depressing.",

I also was in a scenario like that once (not roommates though), and in all honesty I ended up going to the bathroom and crying because of how lonely it made me feel to be missing out on that kind of experience in my life.\n\nSince then, I have been with someone in that way, so I do believe I'm more prepared to deal with that kind of loneliness, but it's more like self-reassurance (that I *can* be desirable) than an actual solution to the problem -- which basically amounts to a chemical imbalance in my brain. I need oxytocin and whatever other happy hormones get released with cuddles and affection. Porn gets you half of it, the dopamine, but never the whole package. Human touch is an integral part of the equation.",

Atleast that is the impression I get from people on dating apps and many people I come across in my daily life. Otherwise why would some people be bullied and ostracized and why would people be okay doing that to others? So many people blatantly say I'm just looking for someone to have sex with but I don't want to truly commit. So many people judge others for what's on the surface - looks, money, status, family status, popularity... that it's not about the need to be cuddled and loved for many in society, because they already have an advantage in that. That need has been met in some way. Maybe not by sex, but maybe they were the favourite child, or the popular kid in school, or one of those girls/guys that don't have to even say or do anything and people are interested in who they are.\nYou know if you are conventionally good looking, you don't have to meet a lot of other superficial criteria for people to give you a chance in any type of relationship or to even include you. People are more likely to invest in even teaching you. You don't have to be particularly interesting. If you have a quiet, shy personality, it is okay. People will reach out and make you comfortable. It's a privilege people don't acknowledge. But if you arent conventionally good looking, you already have to have it all and be the life of the party to compensate. If not, you are rude and weird and a failure.",

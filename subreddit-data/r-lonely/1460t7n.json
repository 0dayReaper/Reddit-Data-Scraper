    "postText": "I get it we all get lonely and depressed at times. At one point in my life I went through a severe depression. Meaning I would go 3 days without brushing my teeth. I never passed a week but 3 days was a max for me. My depression lasted for a good 6 months and I\u2019ve learned to tap back into WHO I AM! Went to the dentist yesterday and they told me I have 2 cavities in my mouth. I am beyond sad about this but I know it could be way worse. So this is a sign for all of you to please brush your teeth. It\u2019s very difficult to get dentist appointments as well. Please be self aware of your dental hygiene. You can be depressed and sad but don\u2019t let it affect your health. \n\nI hope I reached out to the person that needs to hear this! \ud83e\udd17\u2764\ufe0f",

Used to brush them maybe once a week, but at the same time drinking cider/beer/vodka and coke all day every day. I don't drink anymore and I brush them twice a day, but it's definitely way too late. So yes, BRUSH YOUR FUCKING TEETH!",

I am so happy you don\u2019t drink anymore and you brush your teeth twice a day \u2764\ufe0f My foundation is now to brush my teeth in the morning, noon and evening. Also after each meal! I still drink but I don\u2019t drink much. But at work I drink a lot of green tea and sweets. I don\u2019t have access to a tooth brush/mouth wash so that green tea could\u2019ve been the culprit to my cavities. \n\nAnd even after drinking brush our TEETH! It feels so great after brushing the teeth too. Just make it a habit. When you start something and do it for 10 straight days it becomes a habit! And during this habit pattern you can strengthen your teeth like that too. My dentist recommended me sensitive tooth paste.",

If I had to guess, I\u2019d probably say 1-2 times a week. I\u2019m not proud of that, and I know that it\u2019s worse than just \u201cbad\u201d.\n\n\nThank you for the reminder",

I mean: my teeth are in a good enough shape, so it's not like I have visible damage other than some yellowing, but they could've been whiter and a little healthier in the back if I had a good dentist when I was a kid, teen and adolescent. I only now have a fantastic dentist since about 6 years and also a fantastic dental hygienist since about 6 years and it definitely improved the health of my teeth!",

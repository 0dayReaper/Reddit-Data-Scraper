    "postText": "Is anyone else too scared to cut, burn or hit themselves so they emotionally self harm? Such as berating yourself and reminding yourself of everything you're not and will likely never be.\n\nOne way I self harm is by going downtown on Friday or Saturday night and just watching everyone in big groups with their friends or on dates and ask myself, \"why can't I be here?\" It reminds me of a night where me and my friend went downtown for Oktoberfest and he made a bunch of new friends, hit on a bunch of girls and had a great time, while I just followed him around like an errand boy. Every time I tried the same thing, I was either ignored or rebuffed completely, so I just sat on a bench chainsmoking the whole night. \n\nJust going downtown when I'm out working Doordash is enough to send me into a tailspin and I often need to stop and get control of myself.\n\nAnother way is looking at a picture of an old crush and coworker I had who I loved so much. I'm not exaggerating when I say I loved her. She was so beautiful, smart, actually made me laugh a few times and was so sweet to everyone, even me. But I was too much of a bitch to ask her out and then she moved away to Long Beach. So now I look at her picture and tell myself \"you fucked this up\", \"you did this\", \"you could have had it all but you're a weak, insignificant little bitch\".\n\nDoes anyone else do stuff like this?",

It's just us coping with the plethora of failures we've been through, be it be love or academics or a career. Sometimes, it feels that nothing in this world is cut out for us, and that's fine ig? Eventually, one day, we are going to be at peace with the fact that we are all worthless pieces of crap and then call it a day.   \n\n\nBUT, try having a more positive outlook on life? Try being more confident and outgoing, things may change for you. It's most likely too. NOT EVERYONE IS AS HOPELESSLY A FAILURE IN LOVE AMONG OTHER THINGS AS A FEW OF US ARE.",

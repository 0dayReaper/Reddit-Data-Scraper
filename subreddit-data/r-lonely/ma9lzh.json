No reason to get excited about the future at all. I'm on autopilot.\n\nI'm completely disconnected from my family &amp; friends through no fault of theirs. \n\nLife has thrown me a shit-tonne of curveballs, and always at crucial moments which has contributed to my need to continually withdraw from any social interaction outside of work and to reel backwards from the thought of more disappointments. \n\nBack on autopilot for the foreseeable future. \n\nHappy birthday to me.",

But as time goes on it gets better. I\u2019m 52 now and all that sadness is behind me. \nFocus on your kids. I came to find if you make every decision in your life with the emphasis on what is in the best interest of the kids, you cannot go wrong it will steer your life in the better direction.\n always take the highroad with the ex and never  let your anger and hatred get the best of you.  Life does get better. I know you probably think of everything in the context of you doing everything all as one big family. I did that for a long time, but you just have to let it go realize you still have a family it\u2019s just a bit different.  \nI don\u2019t mean to preach but I saw your comment and I thought back to exactly how I felt when all that shit happened to me 11 years ago thought thought maybe I could help with a few words.

This will never help you \u201cget a leg up\u201d or seem likable to your upper coworkers or the people around you. \n\nPay attention to your internal dialogue. Are your constantly filling your head with negative self talk? And What have you done for those around you to help them get a leg up? \n\nMaybe a good birthday gift for yourself this year would be to educate yourself on the victim mindset and a negative internal dialogue, and start being somebody who focuses more on helping those around you. \u2018Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\u2019 type of thing. Maybe pick up a habit that will help you feel better about yourself or life, like meditation, yoga, some sort of physical activity that you enjoy, eating healthy, something like that.\n\nHappy birthday to you! I hope you can look around you and feel grateful for the beauty in nature and humans. I hope you find things you enjoy today. Treat yourself to a nice meal, and to some kind thoughts about yourself. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re an interesting and wonderful person with a lot to offer. I hope you start to pay attention to that and realize it! \u263a\ufe0f\u2600\ufe0f\ud83e\udd73",

I\u2019m a good deal older than OP - and there are things in the story that resonate with my life- undiagnosed ADHD explains what I\u2019ve been through, so I took a shot in the dark and thought maybe OP could check it out.",

Its just that there is a strong disagreement in medical society if the ADHD is a real  disorder at all and offering this guy to search for excuses instead of healthy solutions (such as try support group or get into any social group etc) is what made me react this way",

I don't wanna be lonely anymore and a sex robot is just a huge waste of money imo. I have given myself plenty of time to change things but I always fail at everything I do so I will most likely kill myself in 10 years. And I don't mind that. Death seems freeing and calm.",

If you're not doing much then you should have a lot saved up, go onto the FIRE community and they'll help you retire in a jiffy, if you have spare time then no one is stopping you from learning new hobbies, through hobbies there are groups who share those same hobbies and passions. Facebook groups, Reddit groups, discord groups. Maybe you're a total weirdo who likes so weird type of anime, I'm sure there are thousands like you so don't be afraid to find people who like the same stuff as you.\nLastly before accepting someone in your life you might need to accept yourself, life seems monotonous and you should change that, do sport twice a week even if it's only 10 mins, start appreciating your body more, feeling more confident about yourself and loving yourself before meeting someone else is crucial. Then ultimately dating sites etc but I'm sure you've seen a lot about that already.",

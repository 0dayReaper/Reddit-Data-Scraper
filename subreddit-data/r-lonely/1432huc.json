I\u2019m saddened by my lack of love and the beautiful experiences one could have with it but I\u2019ve not experienced it yet and I never will. Forever empty, that is who I am and who I always will be",

            "comment": "Hey:) I think the most practical answer to that would be that perhaps you could enjoy yourself a little. It\u2019s hard to explain but when you\u2019re focused a bit more on yourself and things that excite you and make you happier, there might be people who would want to share that happiness with you. For example, if you start a hobby in some new place, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019d meet someone who shares your interests and/or values and would be willing to be friends or have a relationship with you eventually. There are always moments in life when we all feel lonely, but it doesn\u2019t last forever. Maybe it\u2019s even better if you\u2019re alone for some time so that you have the time to relax and enjoy yourself + learn how to build some healthy relationships and friendships in the future so that you\u2019re sure when you meet a new person they would be just right for you\u263a\ufe0f",

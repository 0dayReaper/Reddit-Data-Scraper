I\u2019m tired of my \u201clove\u201d life being \n1\u2022 go on tinder/ dating apps\n2\u2022eventually match after a day or so\n3\u2022go on dates, have fun, think it eight work out, eventually sleep with person.\n4\u2022 is it ok if we stay friends?\nNow I was happy with this kind of thing when I was like 18 - 24 because I was never home and I was only in my home country like 4 months a year.\nBut now I want to have more than just hook ups. I\u2019m 26, I walk with a cane due to an old injury, I have nerve damage in my left arm and can\u2019t feel it most of the time. It won\u2019t be long and I won\u2019t be able to get out and meet people and I feel like if I don\u2019t have something going by then I never will. Please tell me someone else feels like time is running out and there\u2019s nothing they can do?",

    "postText": "Hey, what I am going to tell is a bit of a moral disaster. I know it makes me a bad person. But please just help me to understand my feelings.\n\nI recently cut a lot of women out of my life who rejected me romantically. It may be me, but I really don't think a friendship is that big of a deal. For example: I \"replaced\" my former best friend with someone else with whom there is less pressure. Also because this other person doesn't feel attraction to men in general. Especially a friendship with heterosexual women, I don't value that much really. It's also a way of me saying: \"You don't appreciate me, I don't appreciate you\". I felt like they didn't appreciate me, and it felt taxing just being around them and hear all the stories of the guys they fucked and how \"there are no good men around\". I felt more lonely in their presence than outside of it. \n\nI feel like recently I found out people are disposable in a sense that if a person doesn't bring anything to the table, you can just walk away. These girls, most of the times, had a fun personality and were attractive. But they just didn't want to help my needs for intimacy, trust and loyalty. So I had to find someone else and I apparently can find other people who can offer me this - even in a friendship context. Also, these girls often weren't the best friends: a bit unavailable, a bit off and also a bit spoiled.\n\nFor me, loneliness would be cured by finding a relationship. Then I can build up genuine friendships with heterosexual women and I can feel like apparently I am not perceived as some disgusting, ugly beast. Am I wrong to assess these friendships with women who reject me as useless and replaceable?",

You can find that stupid - and I don't blame you.\n\nBut I did get to know people a lot. And I am known to invest a lot of time in getting to know and maintain friendships with people. Only recently I decided to take this road. It's not that I don't see their characters are beautiful: the girl I ditched loved to sing and was superfan of comedy. But for me, a relationship is more important than a friendship. And I felt insulted after all this time, she didn't feel the same for me.",

Its not necessarily wrong to cut people out when they spurn you, but it can make you look like a jerk. Does that make you wrong for moving on from \"friends\" who may use you as a confidant and lean on you emotionally, but want nothing more than that? No, absolutely not. It gets messed up when you start to hear the phrases \"I cant find a man\", \" why cant i find someone like you?\" Or just complaining about how hookups or guys that treat her badly wont commit. Actions like these are signs you may be looking in the wrong place for a partner or you may need to just learn to be okay being single for a bit and work on being happy for yourself. Enjoy hobbies, do productive things and maybe just expand yourself to trying new things that make you a more well rounded person. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou arent wrong for moving on from people who have a negative impact on your life. But the way you do it and how you react to being single is important. And when its time to find someone new, you may want to look more at the person more, not them just being attractive. Thoughts and morals are always more important than looks. Plus, having hobbies and interests you share makes a relationship more enjoyable. So, i hope my rambling helps. Best of luck to you",

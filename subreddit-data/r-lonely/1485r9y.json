    "postText": "Hi, I'm an atheist now, but I grew up in a cult. Long story short I have been severely depressed for 20+ years despite having escaped the cult about 15 years ago. I kept telling myself it would get better with time but looking back, the depression has just been getting worse. Logically, I should be proud of determining the truth through rationality and rejecting everything I knew to be lies. But instead the shame runs so deep that for 15 years I've been unable to look anyone in the eye. (Although this was a problem long before I left the cult because shame was a major tool of manipulation that they hammered into me.) I think I just want to talk to other people who can tell me what happened to me was wrong and that I shouldn't be ashamed of my past.\n\nAnyways... I'm posting here because yes, I'm lonely, but also I don't know Reddit very well. I have no idea where to start, or what kind of communities exist. Any of these kinds of communities would be great if they exist:\n\nA community for people who have escaped religions or cults to discuss how they were damaged by it and how to heal.  \nA community for non-religious people to encourage each other.  \nA community where people share how atheism helps them or the world.  \nIf a community exists that likes to mock organized religion, that could be therapeutic for me too.\n\nWhile writing this I realized that much of Reddit went dark to protest the API costs. That's fine, I will take suggestions and patiently wait for communities to reopen.\n\nThank you for reading!",

You were told seductive lies in order to be useful for a false belief. You\u2019re not too different from the rest of us. \n\nManipulators will continue to manipulate you even when they aren\u2019t around anymore. It\u2019s that effect that they have on us\u2026 this control over us that exists because we accept their presence in our minds.\n\nBe as ashamed as you want but you must learn how to be human again. You\u2019re worth looking at. You deserve peace after beating yourself up for these many years. You deserve closure. But only you can give yourself the closure you need.\n\nI am unsure about the subreddits that you\u2019re looking for. I think you\u2019re better off making a post on r/askreddit and ask for subs that fit your needs. You may receive a troll post but it\u2019s whatever. If you\u2019re not comfortable in asking then I\u2019ll ask for you if you\u2019d like.\n\nGood luck Cult Escaper! Your story will only help others overcome similar challenges as you. As shameless as you may be, you don\u2019t know who needs to hear your story. \ud83c\udf40",

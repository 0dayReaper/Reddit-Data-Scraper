    "postText": "Hey guys.\n\nI am prone to depression. It always goes hand in hand with loneliness for me. I had had it before for a few years, from 2017 to 2022, which includes the time spent in covid lockdown. The lockdown period in particular hit me really hard; I couldn\u2019t stand the loneliness. However even after it ended (2021) and I started spending time with my friends again, I feel like I never really recovered - as if it was never enough to make up for the time lost in being lonely; it plagued me well into 2022. No matter what I did, the hobbies I took up, the people I hung out with, the vacations I had, I always felt immensely lonely (not the fault of the people around me - they are my soulmates and support me so much). Then I fell in love, which for the first time in all those years made me feel alive and not lonely anymore. Sadly it ended in a very bad heartbreak for me; because of this I started psychotherapy which helped me immensely. Life became enjoyable, and this joy wasn\u2019t dependent on external things (friends or love or whatever) - it came from within. For a few months I was completely over with my depression. However I definitely felt weak and fragile and I really needed the emotional support my loved ones could provide; it felt like until I became more stable, one step in the wrong direction could erase all my progress. And that\u2019s what happened. I chose the worst time to go to study abroad for a semester on an exchange program; I wanted to push myself out of my comfort zone and this was my last chance to do it before finishing my degree. Throughout my exchange (which started at the end of January 2023 and will finish at the end of June) I had a really bad time because I genuinely hate the city I live in, I didn\u2019t make any meaningful connections with other people (not because I didn\u2019t try - believe me, I did my best to socialize and go out and travel), and the university courses were so demanding that there were periods where I had to study for 10 hours a day just to pass an exam (not aiming for the highest grade whatsoever), which took a toll on my social life. There were some weeks when I would not go out to meet people at all because I just couldn\u2019t find the time, meaning being isolated for days. Add in the fact that the whole time I felt like all of this is so meaningless (my degree, my time there, I felt like I wasn\u2019t growing in any meaningful way). I had even more issues but there\u2019s no point going into details. Generally I just had a very hard time, always feeling out of place, suffering mentally and physically and being unable to do anything about it. Sometimes I would be sick to my stomach from all the bad emotions I felt. I tried to keep a positive attitude as much as I could but eventually my depression started acting out again two days after I sat my last exam. This was around the middle of May. I don\u2019t remember it ever being that bad. I felt like I was detached from myself again, angry and hopeless all the time. I went on travelling for a few weeks and it helped a bit, but now that I\u2019m back home for a few days and I like it here, again I feel so lonely everytime I\u2019m not spending time with others; I am so deprived of meaningful connection that every minute of being alone damages me a hundred times more than every minute being with others heals me. Also I have to go back in a few days to finish my official exchange period and I don\u2019t even want to think about spending a few more days in that city because it is and will forever be associated for me with these feelings and makes me sick. \n\nSo my question is this: what advice could you give me for getting over this experience and feeling like myself again and escaping this vicious circle of loneliness? I\u2019m still in therapy, but I\u2019m in such a plateau I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.",

Robin's house got a little face-lift in front and Leo's tree/Linus campsite look nice too. \ud83d\ude04 oh and the beach and Leah has a nice little area to drink coffee and eat salad lol. \n\nYeah, the creator still updates it pretty regularly =) have you made it to ginger island?\n\nI love that idea, to turn your farm into a city!

    "postText": "I'm sure others feel this way as well, but lately I've been feeling a very strong struggle inside of myself. On one hand, I desire the connection made with other people, both in person and through the internet. On the other hand, I really don't want to go through the process of making that connection. I'm not sure if it's a matter of age (I'm 41) or if recent experiences have made it difficult to figure out what it is that I actually need.",

What\u2019s weird though is I can have a night out drinking and dancing and have great fun but it\u2019s superficial. I want to have friends who want to have lunch, dinner, coffee or a casual drink with me. I\u2019ve moved countries many times in the last few years and all my really good friends live across the globe. I literally have 0 friends where I live right now. I\u2019ve been trying though. I don\u2019t know what is wrong with me.",

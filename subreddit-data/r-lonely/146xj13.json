    "postText": "It's one of those rough uneventful nights when you're hit with the realization that you are alone and nobody really cares.\n\nI'm tired of this feeling. In fact I think I'm starting to get numb whenever I feel this way. It starts when the days drift off as if it's nothing. Life will simply start happening around me and then I realize nothing is happening with my own life.\n\nBy then it stings and the days that turn to weeks and to months become unbearable. Why couldn't time just stop for a moment? Why couldn't life just slow down for a bit?\n\nI just want to breathe, I just need a break. Can't I stop for a moment and ask myself what all this is for?\n\nI just want to cry but my eyes won't let me. I feel ashamed when I do, I feel ugly and I judge myself profusely as if I'm just faking it. I get that life isn't pretty but why does it have to be miserable?\n\nI miss the times I could tell someone about this and they'll be more than willing to stop what they're doing and listen but alas people grow up and people move on.\n\nI'm tired, I want it all to end to be honest. I wish I could just not exist anymore.\n\nDid you know I was trying to improve my life? I was seriously trying to improve it only to get injured somehow and now I can't even try.... \n\nIt's like I'm meant to stay still and be miserable... ahhh I just want to cry... I feel so pathetic.",

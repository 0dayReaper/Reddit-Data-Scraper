    "postText": "I'm a sophomore; I was online from 7th-9th so I was excited to get back into school since I was lonely and prior I went to a school an hour away. I'm currently going to my local school so originally I thought I'd be able to hang out and join clubs sports etc.\n\nIt's the last day and I'm still all alone. My first semester I genuinely didn't say a word to anyone; no more than 2 people knew my name.\n\nSecond semester was better; during PE sometimes people would talk to me but, half the time I was left alone+ still eating lunch alone.\n\nI hadn't gone to school most of the last week since I've finished all my work. I decided to go the last day since I was hoping maybe the few people I've talked to would say bye.\n\nOf course that didn't happen. Not even my teachers. I didn't say a word the whole day which isn't uncommon but I just wanted a 'bye' from anyone at all; was hoping to atleast be acknowledged for not being there the last few days. I just wanted even 1 single person to atleast acknowledge me.",

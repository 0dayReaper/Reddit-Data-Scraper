No need to feel embarrassed, people are just mean because reddit is anonymous and they hate themselves and take it out on others. \n\nI wish you had had warning before, but reddit is a bad place to be for minors, for many reasons on many levels. Male, female, or otherwise, it's really not a safe place. Whether it's emotional vulnerability or anything else. You shouldn't feel like you don't belong, but maybe only post things that you would be comfortable posting in front of your parents, friends, teachers, real life ppl, etc. \n\nI'm glad you're here, and I admire the strength you use when you reach out. You shouldn't have been made to feel embarrassed or pathetic.",

Focus on studies and skills after a few years people would wanna be your friend if you're successful and at that time you'll have the sense of who to interact with and with whom not to.

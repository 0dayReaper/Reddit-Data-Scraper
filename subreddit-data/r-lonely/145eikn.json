            "comment": "Going through loneliness is something I've dealed with my entire life. Ever since i was in middle school i rarely ever talked to anyone to the point that from the second I got out of my house at 7 in the morning til i came back home 2 in the afternoon i could count the total words I've said on my fingers. I am now a college sophomore. I have 1 homie, and he's a good person and a friend group that I am not really close with, but i go out with every now and then to fulfil my social desire.\nBut there's a catch.\nTo deal with relationships is to take in both the good and the bad (not being invited to hangouts/group chats, silly fights and so many more) cuz no matter how good anything might look in life. It's not perfect.\nObviously, these little things in friendships could make you way more miserable than when you were alone.\nI didn't understand why my friend group didn't add me in these chat groups and why they always left me out in the cold, \"the only friends I got\", i felt betrayed and angry and confused and jealous.\n\nSo I asked myself a simple question. Am I a likeable person? Why do so many people hate me ? Was I a good person let unto a bad world or a bad person let unto a good world. Turns out the answer is way simpler. The answer is a question: Why do i want to be liked ? Is it to satisfy my craving for validation? Do I want people to cheer for me and love me wherever I go? These thoughts are immature and breed weakness. The only unconditional love you might be lucky to receive is from your parents, and that's it. Any other person expects something in return.\nSo you have 1 of 2 choices\n\n1:ADAPT; You start working on yourself (go to the gym, learn a new skill, read more), and this will make you overall a much more interesting person. And that what you will give people in return for their love. Because intelligence attracts minds.\n\n2:OVERCOME; you forget about everyone and everything and start reflecting deeply within yourself and realise what you are truly missing. And what do you need to have a fulfilled spirit. For me, that was the real cure. Going to pray in the mosque 5 times a day. Feeding that cat in front of my apartment before going out. Helping that old man cross the street. And many other little good deeds that help you escape from that dark part of your mind.\n\nNow, of course, you could do both. And get better results. \nAnd remember this quote \"when you waste your time trying to catch butterflies you will never succeed, but if you spend that time building a beautiful garden the butterflies will come to you, and if they don't atleast now you have a beautiful garden\".",

You had something and then you lost them (their loss tbh). Your reply is completely true and the right way to deal with this situation but at the same time it makes me feel even sadder and lonelier.",

Friends give purpose, happiness. Hell, it's said numerous times: Happiness is the relationships you have. \nIt's funny how that works. But I guess what we should do is just do what's within our control, and that's learning things we wanna learn and doing the things we wanna do. Watch that show or movie. Eat that food. I don't know if it makes sense but I guess just live life despite being friendless. Hell, I'm still trying, but I make do. We are all here for each other, and I wish you well. Maybe eventually we'll cross paths with that one really cool guy when we least expect it.",

Its one of the most hopeless feelings in the world. Id take pain over emptiness every time. \nBut you gotta hope that one day you might feel different. Cos noone knows the person youll be in the future. \nI find it very difficult to find friends. Its almost unbearable being around other people these days because social anxiety. But i just try to keep doing shit and act like its not there cos i know if i give in to it and isolate myself then that will make it all so much worse. I have very few friends but the ones i do have, i will cherish because of how difficult it is to find them. \nAnd heres the best part. The lonelier you are today, the greater the miracle when you find someone. \nI know im going to burst into tears the first time i look in someones eyes and know they get it. \nI live for that day.

Am I resistant to change? Very resistant. I don't get (or give myself, whatever you prefer) the opportunities to change. Sure, I could meet that one person that can change my life. Its also, much, much more likely that I never meet that person. Especially if I always hole myself up like I always do. \n\nIt's next to impossible for me to enjoy my life because its not my own. Everything I do isn't for myself, but for someone else or something they tell me to do. Because of that, I've grown up into someone who never developed himself and just lived on to be a robot. At this point, I can't even bring myself to socialize with someone else because I feel like a burden to them. I'm certainly not enjoyable to be around or converse and I take away their precious time. The only time I can force myself to socialize is when I need to for personal benefit, which I see as manipulative. And the only way for me to contribute to this world is to avoid that as much as possible. \n\nI'd like to say that this isn't just the occasional rut or bleak feelings that everyone experiences. This is my life, every single day of it. And the thing I fear the most is to get what I've wanted and not even appreciate it for how valuable it is if I ever get lucky enough. I'd rather suffer my entire life then have that happen and I certainly deserve to suffer if I do let that happen. The worst thing I can do is treat someone life a piece of shit. If I even meet someone so valuable and worthwhile, I know I would have so little to offer compared to all the other options out there. \n\nI know the only advice you can give is to wait until that special person enters my life, but I cant. I cant bring myself to be so excessively selfish. Thats why I describe myself the way I do and assure myself that loneliness is a part of me. Out of everyone, I'm probably the most equipped to deal with it. But I can also tell you that I'm not a good person. Someone that has to sulk in the shadows can only do so much.",

And the mind and body are heavily connected. When I say body, I'm including the mind with it. I find it bizarre how people could love and cherish themselves so much yet rely on drugs and alcohol and etc to change their personality to the point they aren't even themselves. Its certainly not reliable or even healthy introspection. \n\nI don't have time for soul searching nor time to love myself. I have other obligations that are more important than myself. For context, I'm 18 and I do live with my parents, although I'm in college, but none of that really matters (for further context, I don't really have likes/dislikes. I tend to stay fairly neutral on most things unless theres overwhelming factual evidence. I wasn't lying when I said I was dull). I think in all of this, you're making a false assumption: you have to be happy and the whole point of being alive is to be happy. Thats just not true. Plenty of people have lived and died without ever being happy. How can someone love me if I don't love myself? You're right, guess I'll be lonely forever. Did you think I didn't realize that? Of course I did and I accepted that long ago. Its funny how you say that, but also say its impossible to know yourself until you're with someone. Aren't those opposites? Its almost like to love yourself, you need to experience some sort of love first. Thats the problem I have with that phrase. \n\nAnyway, what you're basically saying is that is that I should ruin someone's life to find out if what I say is true (and hey, I might be wrong or am exaggerating). But its not worth the risk. How many people's time do I gotta waste, how much anger do I need to incite, how much resentment and hate do I need to invoke before you realize its not worth it? Why attempt further on when I know the outcome of previous tries. Heck , theres no point in trying when I don't even prioritize my mental health, sanity, and happiness above my work and studies. Fact of the matter is that I don't have time to improve myself or be socially attractive. And believing in the fairy tale of happiness and luck that will one day bless me isn't gonna work. I'm the type that needs concrete facts. \n\nJust like how a rick kid and a poor kid will see the world in different ways, people who lived \"normal\" lives will see things differently from those that had to face hardships early on. By that analogy, I'd probably be the guy wearing newspaper underwear. But thats a pretty presumptuous assumption to make. \n\nAre you someone that believes that humans are \"social creatures\"? It kinda seems like it based on how you paint people as needing each other. If you do, then let me tell you that humans (and many other living things by extension) adapt to the environment they live in. Just as I've been raised to only rely on myself and work towards a goal I have little interest in. And I'm not the only one that knows theres no hope for them. Whether is be because of a physical ailment or a past crime or whatever, people can be completely isolated, even from no fault of their own. The world may be a big place, but because its so big you can waddle around forever and die before finding someone that understands you. Thats much more likely than the fairy tale of meeting that special someone. \n\nThats the fate that awaits someone like me who accepts these conditions and mental state as tolerable.",

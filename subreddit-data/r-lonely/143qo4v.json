    "postText": "So other than the friend I live with, the only friend I have in town are work friends. As the title says, they make plans and do not include me. We get along well at work so I don't know what's going on. This is an ongoing problem for a couple of years. I only hear about their activities after the fact so I don't really have a chance to ask to participate.\n\nIt makes me wonder if it's a chore to be around me which doesn't make sense because they don't avoid me at work. The one that's hurting right now is a couple of years ago I had a person  that I really got along with but we got some more people and I started to feel isolated from them. I felt really close to this person but it felt like I got dropped for cooler people. It hurts to realize people don't feel as close to you as you do to them.\n\nYeah I'm just in my feels right now.",

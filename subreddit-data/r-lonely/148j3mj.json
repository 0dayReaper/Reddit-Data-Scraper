I'm so desperate to just be fucking seen and understood but the idea of that actually happening terrifies me. I don't know what it is but I feel like there is something deeply, fundamentally wrong with me. I don't make sense. I don't want to take up space anymore, I just want to stop existing.",

I've been trying to throw myself out there and be social but it's incredibly hard when you've been burned in the past. And while this is just from one internet stranger to another, your worth doesn't lay in other peoples' eyes. Just know that there are people out there who are worth your time, even if you have to thread through the mud for a while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI totally understand if you don't trust this or me, but if you ever need kind voice to bounce off of, I'm here. Take care of yourself, okay?",

It could be due to the fact you don\u2019t feel you are worthy for something in which case you will self sabotage every time you get close to achieving a goal. \n\nThere is a great book which helped me with this. It\u2019s called \u201cThe mountain is you\u201d by Brianna Wiest \n\nI got it in audio form as I don\u2019t like reading ha! It is really great at helping you with that exact situation. \n\nI hope this helps!",

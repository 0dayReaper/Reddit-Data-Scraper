I struggle with depression and anxiety which doesn\u2019t help, but im working through it. I do good in school, so my life looks pretty good on paper, but I\u2019ve been struggling relationship wise for a long time. I have a decent amount of guy friends, so I can be social at times. I feel like I don\u2019t get in many situations where I can meet girls who are single",

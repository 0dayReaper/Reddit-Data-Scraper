    "postText": "I've been having an awful week. The girl I thought I had a decent chance of starting a relationship rejected me. She was nice about it and was ok with being friends. I'm less depressed about her specifically, and more about going back to being perpetually lonely with little hope.\n\nI also have a very difficult time making and maintaining friendships. Most people I'd like to call friends are acquaintances at best and I don't see them regularly. I know my life would be much better if I had a solid close friend group and a girlfriend, there's no doubt about it. For some people, being rejected hurts, but they have people to vent to and rely on in bad times. I have no one I really feel close enough to vent to. Would be amazing if in awful situations I had a loving person's shoulder to cry on instead of suffering in silence. All I ever wanted was a solid friend group and a relationship but I never had that because I am boring, weird, socially awkward, probably autistic, and not attractive enough to make up for those flaws.",

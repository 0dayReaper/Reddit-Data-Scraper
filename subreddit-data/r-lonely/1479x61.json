    "postText": "I love my dog to bits and she keeps me great company for sure.  I am very grateful for her and would be so much more miserable without her without a doubt.\n\nShe is not, however, a substitute for genuine friendships with people or a significant other.\n\nMy Dad died in 2018 of a sudden heart attack and my life has gone downhill steadily since then.\n\nThe way my current life is, I work and sit on my balcony, or in my room with my dog. I have no friends at all. My anxiety and depression are worsening over time. I spend most of my free time on my phone or computer to escape this. I am, almost all day, every day, plagued with the crushing knowledge of my mortality. I think about the concept of death all the time, I think about my own death, how it will happen, when it will happen.. I overanalyze my past decisions that will ultimately influence it. I think about my mother's death and when that will come and the mortality of my sister and dog. I feel like I am walking on a tightrope. Every unhealthy thing I eat or beer I drink is like I might as well be edging myself closer to my demise, and in a very tangible way. I'm struggling to stop this. I'm sure most people are aware of this as they partake in their own respective unhealthy habits. I know I always have been, but things haven\u2019t always felt this fragile. It all feels literally like taking another step towards a very visible cliff edge these days.\n\nBasically I'm lonely as fuck and fucking obsessed with death. I'm riddled with anxiety, dread, and a general sense of isolation even though I live in the suburbs now and work around a bunch of people in my retail store. I feel like shit all the damn time.. much more often than I should at my age. By cultural standards I'm in the \"prime of my life,\" yet I feel like I might as well be a 75 year old rotting away in my apartment.\n\nAnd I simply feel too shitty to be able to do anything about it or make any meaningful change. I'm trying to hype myself up, I'm trying to motivate myself to make changes. I have a list written up, I have inspirational quotes in my notebook and all that.\n\nBut I feel like I'm wading through very heavy and thick, melancholic molasses in my efforts to make these changes.\n\nSometimes I do wish I had just been born a dog or a lizard or something that is not so acutely aware of its own mortality, stuck in a world where practically everything and every choice you make can easily (and often does) edge you closer to it. My dog has about another 6 years left here at best. Is she worried about it? Nah, she's too busy sniffing the air and chasing a beetle with her nose.",

            "comment": "Hiya,  \n\n\nDogs are a truly wonderful existence for humans. We honestly do not deserve them for how much they give us in return.\n\nAssuming your young in your 20s? If so, sorry for your loss. I cant say I've lost parents, but I can only imagine the pain you've been through the past few years, especially with COVID which made a significant impact on everyones physical and mental health. We got through that, you can get through this! \n\nI would suggest limiting your time on devices such as your PC and mobile phone other than essential calls, etc. Fill this time with hobbies and passion projects.\n\nMortality is a tough subject. If you read into it too much you'll go down a rabbit hole. None of us are immortal, I could die in my sleep tomorrow, or get hit by a bus, we just don't know. I assume that this obsession with mortality is tied to suicidal tendancies? Forgive me if im wrong. We are all here on borrowed time. Do you want to spend this time worrying about your eventual demise? Or would you rather spend it fulfilling your dreams and desires? Think of yourself in 10-20 years, and imagine what they think of what you're going through now. No doubt you'll be wiser and living life to its fullest!\n\nOveranalyzing the past is a double-edged sword. You might realise something you did wrong and something you could've done better. Whats important is that you learn from these mistakes you overanalyze about, dwelling on what you did a decade ago is useless and gets you nowhere. Lower the pressure you put on yourself. Nobody does well under this much pressure for extended periods of time. I'd suggest just taking a mental note of when this happens and actively go against it, be it through positive reinforcement or affirmations of \"This is dumb\" or \"I need to stop this\", eventually your subconscious will get the message. \n\nLoneliness is strange, you could be immersed in New York City among tens of thousands and still feel lonely. I would suggest volunteering, it maintains a semi-professional standard of work and relations with your colleagues and customers while also providing the opportunity for friendships, while also taking up time out of the day you might otherwise have free. \n\nIts good that you are trying to change, some wallow in their existence in this state, which does no good. See what works best for motivating yourself. Seems you've experimented with a few things. I'd give journalling a go, didnt work for me but might for you. Don't lose this mindset as it keeps you wanting to improve and do better for yourself and those around you. \n\nNobody succeeds quickly, \"wading through very heavy and thick, melancholic molasses\" is a metaphorical way to put it, but its true. Realise that while it is heavy and thick, you are still moving. Life is full of trials and tribulations, which push us through it one step at a time.\n\nTake a note from your pet. They may not have the thought capacity we have, that doesn't stop them living life to its fullest. If not for you, start with your dog!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to DM.\n\nTake care of yourself.",

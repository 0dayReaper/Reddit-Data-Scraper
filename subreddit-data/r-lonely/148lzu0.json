Please do not join and say nothing!! i also made it with the intent of it being a safer space then the order discord servers out there without jeaporidizing free speech. the niche of the server is you have to interact atleast once a month with others, can be very long or very short, but i do keep track of it!! please feel free to join, we decided to cap at 100 and are nearing 90 now!! there is no age cap, but to join must be 18 or older!!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/hNGjt2N9",

Never been to a server where everyone but mods are equal, there\u2019s always 20+ ranks and different colors, special accommodations made for certain users, etc. They always end up feeling like a hostile place.",

We're just chill and I think most of us are pretty kind, but I do know the vibe you're talking about. But if you wanna pop in and stay for a bit then leave that would be cool. Hope you see you there and if not have a great one :)",

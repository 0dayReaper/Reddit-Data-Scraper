Something I've been doing to take a lot of the 'birthday pressures' off of myself is to celebrate the day before - sort of a 'last day at this age' acknowledgment of getting through another year of both good &amp; bad.\n\nThis year, I spent the day downtown at our local arts festival, treating myself to anything I wanted. My birthday was just very low-key, which was just fine given all I had done the previous day.\n\nSomething to give a try next year, but for this year, keep in mind you're not alone - this community cares &amp; wishes you many happy returns on the day. \n\nSo treat yourself - it doesn't have to be a big expensive gesture either. It can be a small kindness that you can give to you - watch a favorite movie, spend some time in a park, make a soothing cup of tea - whatever nice thing you might do for someone else on their birthday, do for yourself because you are worth it. \n\nWith that said, happy birthday fellow Gemini &amp; be kind to yourself today :)",

I wish I could make new people and show my true colors to the public but now I have to stay private for my safety.",

From all the different possibilities that could have occured, your existence here is nothing short of remarkable. A little romanticism can never hurt you know.\nOur loneliness, melancholy and strange pangs of nostalgia are the evidence of our humanity. That's the whole point. You just have to stay.

But the cake is a lie. Since we were young we're being told that out birthday is like a holiday, what are we celebrating though? The fact that we exist, the fact that the earth completed another full circle around the sun since we were born, or maybe us getting older and practically another step closer to the end.\n\nI don't need to tell you this, but I will anyway. Life isn't a fucking gift ok? You've never asked for it, your consent wasn't needed, and how you feel about it it's just as irrelevant. Since we have no choice in the matter, our society takes a positive attitude towards it, teaching us to be grateful for it, respect our parents, value life at all costs. The same society we're destined to become slaves for. \n\nBut I get it, I really do. My way of seeing it is considered negative and desperate - it's literally bad for me. But what's the alternative? Just blindly keep following the herd, hoping that things will get better, because what choice do we have anyway. Ignorance is the safest comfort zone you can find.",

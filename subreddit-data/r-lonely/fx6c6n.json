Loneliness due to lack of social resources/ isolation (for whatever reason) and perhaps a spiritual loneliness (feeling a deep, perhaps life long sense of distance from humanity/ the universe/ god/ whatever the fuck.) A person can go thru all of these or some of these over their lifetime. Some people never truly escape it. Some do. I know I\u2019ve heavily identified my own life story with the last one though I was privileged enough to have social resources. In my younger years I had a lot more friends and I noticed a contrast between my inner feelings of separateness vs my outer appearance of togetherness a lot. It wasn\u2019t until later I really started isolating first by choice and then because no one wanted me around. I don\u2019t feel it quite as much at the moment though I\u2019m not sure why. I understand though as a generality that when a person has suffered with something for a long time it can be annoying to watch other people seem to dip their baby toe in your everyday hell and complain lol. Honestly no one can gatekeep another\u2019s emotional state because our emotions are personal and they aren\u2019t wrong/ right or good/ bad. I do agree however that they aren\u2019t always based on fact.",

Really smart, good lookin, friendly guy who always had nice things to say about everyone. He was friends with everyone, was class president or whatever the equivalent of student council is for college, always involved in stuff. I met him freshman year~ our junior year he posted this long post on Facebook about how he's been struggling with depression for a long time and had seriously contemplated suicide several times in the past. I mean it completely blew my mind. I never would have thought that at all with how upbeat he was all the time. He is a constant reminder for me of how you never know what's going on in someone's mind. While I may perceive him to be the bubbly social butterfly, that's not how he saw himself at all in his mind. Treating others how you would want to be treated is so important because of that. You just never know.",

It's nice to be noticed and appreciated for a change. Thank you so much for making my memory recall what it feels like to actually be heard and like I my words still have the ability to make an impact",

I was also doing self therapy and it was better to do it on my own. Ultimately, I accepted that I have a few friends and that is enough.\n\nI do not have much sympathy for complainers especially about the quarantine. Everyone has problems and everyone hits 100% of their stress level. Some can handle more some less.",

I'm glad that, at least, I'm used to being inside by myself. I won't down-vote you, get what you mean, but think you'll feel differently, once you've learned more about the world.\n\nJust because one is used to suffering, it doesn't negate the feeling of people who aren't used to it, and it's something that you may be on the brighter end of, someday. A stranger in a new, uncomfortable land. It's a pandemic, man. Sit back, and enjoy the historical-ride, if possible. As that's often not an easy thing to do, now is a great time to experiment with what you may like about life, yourself, time and space, or the divine nothingness. \n\nHope the other side of this may go somewhat better for you.",

All I\u2019m saying is there are people out there who get treated like they\u2019re celebrities but they would not for one second not try and find a way to stab you in your back or treat your feelings like they\u2019re meaningless. I don\u2019t care one bit about what you may be going through during this. Sorry, not sorry",

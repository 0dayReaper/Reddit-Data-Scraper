How do you cope with the fact that you are a wasted life ? How do you cope with being in a student residence and hearing others laughing and going to and from parties every day, living their best life, when you haven't seen the light of day in over a week ?\n\nEvery day I feel like I'm sinking a little more, every day I keep asking myself why I keep getting up in the morning",

I've went NC with my ex who was also my only proper friend for the past 2-3 years. And God do I feel empty and numb. I do not know how to deal with it, except for the fact that I gotta increase my self esteem, no matter what. \n\nI do not know if you've gone through trauma, and if you did, take your time. Don't be so hard on yourself that you're not able to mingle. \n\nI just lose myself in endless hours of yt scrolling, which I do not even enjoy. I could do something that would make me happy, but that would just give me that hope.\n\nI'm currently facing the pressure of academics, believing that I CANNOT do it, but I know I can. Hope we come out of these vicious cycles, whatever be the reason.\n\nTake care, mate",

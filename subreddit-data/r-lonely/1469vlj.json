    "postText": "Hi \ud83d\udc4b\nI think i'm allowed to make these posts?? \n\nSo i'm hoping this won't be deleted: \n\nWould anyone like to be penpals? I'm 22F, born and live in the UK. My hobbies are reading, cycling, and cross stitch. But now that it's summer, I like going for walks too. I like doing a bit of cooking as well, and i'd love to learn to bake, but attempts so far have been dire lol. \n\nI suppose you can learn alot about me from the subs i'm in: i'm roman catholic, a former accounting student (graduating in July!), i'm a fan of RD2 and the Sims, I like kpop, and i'm an F1 fan too.\ud83d\ude05 \n\nHonestly it would be really nice if I had someone I could really talk to. And i'd like to be that person for other people too. \n\nI feel a bit nervous reaching out like this lol\nBut i'm gonna give it a try anyways x",

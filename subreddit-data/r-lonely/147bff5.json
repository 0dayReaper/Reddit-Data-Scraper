The Mary Tyler Moore Show is one I keep going back to. \n\nAny show with a particularly strong script in which friendship is one of the prevailing themes. \n\n30 years ago, I never watched daytime TV or read about pop culture and when my mother would talk about Regis &amp; Cathy Lee I thought she was talking about new neighbors. I was so shocked that when I realized she had these parasocial relationships with celebrities she never met. \n\nBut I am actually worse. At least my mother's parasocial friends were real people. Mine are fictional characters.\n\nIt is a common coping mechanism I think and I guess it is better than nothing if it helps to self-regulate, emotionally, but I believe at least in my case it is counter-productive. \n\nIf I was a bit stronger, if I wasn't afraid of doing something more desperate, I think maybe feeling the despair might ultimately force me to go out and connect with actual humans. \n\n(Not that it has been satisfying when I have tried to do that. There is no straightforward way to solicit nonsexual friendships at the age I have reached -- all my peers are well established in terms of family and community and don't need new recruits).",

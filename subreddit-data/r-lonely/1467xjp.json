    "postText": "after graduating highschool, i feel lonelier than ever. sure i hated highschool for a while, but i realized it was the only time i got to socialize with others. it wasn't until a few months before graduation that i actually looked forward going to school. i wish i wouldn't have taken that time for granted, because maybe i would actually be talking to people still. it's not that i can't make friends, but rather i can't make them stay. everyone else is living their lives hanging with their real friends enjoying summer, but im at home looking at their stories, wishing i had a group to call my own. i keep telling myself that everyone else is in their prime right now and my time will come later on but i'm not so sure it will. if only i put aside my feelings and sense of pride for a while, maybe my life now would be different.

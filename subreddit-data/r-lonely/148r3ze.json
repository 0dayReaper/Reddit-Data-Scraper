Every year  is  exactly  the  same\n\nAt  the  start  or  during  the  summer  I  force myself  to  change  who  I  am  and  what  it like  this  shit  has  been  going  on  since  3rd grade  :(\n\nThen  at  the  start  of  year  I  make  \"friends\"\n\nThen  I  loose   those \"friends\"\n\nThen  I  am  alone  for  the  rest  of   the   year and   I say  I  hate   everyone \n\nThen  at  the  end  I  start  to  miss  some  nice people. \n\nRepeat\n\nLast  summer  was  the  worst. I  gave  up on all  of  my  favorite  shows,  forced  myself  to watch  some  more  popular shows. Download a shit ton of social media and spent hours curating a fake personality and making the perfect posts. Now I'm addicted to Instagram and   reddit   help please  . Changed the way I speak. Then I made \"friends\" 2 weeks later we got into a fight and now I am alone. \n\nI'm tired of this I want to have friends but I'm a weirdo why can't I just be normal why can't I just watch tv like everyone else nope I just have to be obsessed whith kids shows \ud83d\ude41\ud83d\ude22 I just want to be normal",

You're describing the superficial, it's what you'd think everyone wants to see - they don't. Social media is used for projection, self promotion, it's not about you it's about them and their perfect life - which obviously isn't perfect. If you try to make friends that way at best you'd get some admirers that'll ditch you as soon as something more interesting shows up. It's how popularity works.\n\nBe your quirky imperfect self. We all stink when we fart, we're all nasty and ugly, certainly very far from perfect. You're not alone in that.",

Being told to \u201cstop wanting what I want\u201d never quite worked for me. It\u2019s a rather bleak and limited way of experiencing the world.\n\nOP, take a few months for yourself and work on your self-perception &amp; boundaries. It seems to me that you are letting the wrong people in because of your cravings for affection. You are most likely young, chances are you have yet to experience various demographics and environments. There are countless kinds of people in this world. Ultimately, you have the power to shape your experiences and surround yourself with people who genuinely uplift and support you, as opposed to taking advantage of your kindness.\n\nMake sure you make your intentions clear to women. If you say you don\u2019t want more friends, then make that clear to women you\u2019re talking to *instead of getting resentful that they don\u2019t fancy you*. Don\u2019t be the guy who pretends to be a friend but secretly expects something more. Deception and false intentions are extremely unappealing and off-putting, and this behaviour is sadly common.\n\nBest of luck.\n\nedit: typo",

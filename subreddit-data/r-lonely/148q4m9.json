    "postText": "35M/36F why is it the first time I truly find someone who makes me happy, someone who brought out positive feelings I've never had before. How does that person confidently just shit all over that and bring me to the lowest level I've ever been in. I feel like I was just used and thrown away for no reason. She was the best thing that ever came into my life and even she was happy to get away from her emotionally abusive ex and was glad we met. While I sit here broken and dying inside she can't even say a word to me. Does she even feel anything? Was she lying the whole time? Why am I so stupid believing her? I genuinely thought this was my one and only. And she told me the same. Now I don't think I will ever let another person close to me. I can't. I still have very strong feelings for her and those won't ever go away. But I honestly think I can ever let another person get close to me  like that. I can't do this level of hurt 2 times. FML",

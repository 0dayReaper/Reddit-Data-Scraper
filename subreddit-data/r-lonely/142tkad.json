I\u2019m also not sure if this is the right subreddit so if there is a better place for this please direct me there. I started in a PhD program this past fall and one thing that I was hoping for was to meet someone maybe in my program. There was a guy who I thought was interested in me but he never said anything and I just learned that he very recently (in the past month?) got a girlfriend. I have never been asked out on a date, let alone been in any kind of relationship, and just feel lonely overall. I have always kind of struggled with making friends as well as I am generally a shy person and am always afraid to make the first move. I thought that this might have been my chance at finding someone but now I feel like it\u2019s never going to happen. I haven\u2019t ever really used dating apps either since again, I\u2019m kind of afraid of making the first move and don\u2019t really have many pictures of myself to put on one if I\u2019m being honest. I have also heard horror stories about these apps that make me hesitant to join one. Has anyone else been in a situation like this? If so, what did you do? Any advice is appreciated.",

            "comment": "Congratulations on your PhD, you should be proud! Dating can be quite difficult, there's no shame in having troubles on that front. As for advice... I think you should try dating apps, if it works - it works, if it doesn't - at least you'll know. I'm well aware of the stigma around dating apps but having met my most recent ex there and many quality girls as well, I've gotta say that there are some decent people out there.\n\nOther than that, I think you should join a club or just look into group activities in general. It should be something that would allow you to interact with other people without it being forced, it should provide context. Have you ever wanted to learn a new language? I wasn't ever that passionate about it, but I've wanted to learn how to dance so I've tried doing that. I've had fun, met some new people and learned something I'm interested in in the process.",

    "postText": "I'm a 28 year old guy, on my own in an area wholly unfamiliar to me. Just recently I've switched hours at work so I can finally start having a social life and getting out of this damn lonely rut I've been in. My job still consists of talking to people so you might wonder how that could be the case? But it's about the kind of interactions that occur. Passion, honesty, wonder and adventure are the things I offer in conversation, shoot me a message and maybe we can all get through this together!",

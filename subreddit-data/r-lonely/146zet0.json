It kills me to know that out there are amazing things but never gonna be for me because multiple  reasons. That realization kills me.  Maybe I just trying desperately to find anything to evade my miserable reality. And I am here I don't know why trying to help you because your post really was like I wroted myself. If you like we can talk about anything, maybe we can find a solution together.",

The loneliness,  the sadness, the pain. A cup can only take but a certain amount before it fills up. And with those cups being filled to the bring, we struggle to find new ones to drop our bad feelings. At least that what it seems to me. Friends, they seem the be to busy to share with me the time they used to. Videos games, they cannot longer give me the escape from this reality toward a world where I could surpass everything with my skills. Also online games are filled with douches ... alcohol is no longer sweet and able to bury everything behind an injection of euphoria and joy, but bitter making everything hit harder, making every sad memories resurface,  also I've seen the videos , I'm not a good dancer when I'm drunk ... F it",

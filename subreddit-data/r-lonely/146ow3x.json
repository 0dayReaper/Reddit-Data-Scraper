    "postText": "Everyone says DM and nobody fucking replies after like a few exchanges. No wonder why you're all fucking lonely. I literally have no compassion for any of you who don't even know how to carry a fucking conversation. like how the fuck do you not even respond... \n\nlike all you have to do is say something.. anything.. how are you gonna make friends? I'm working, travelling and doing all of my responsibilities and still keeping up with every active conversation hoping to make a real connection then I understand why you guys are the way you are. \n\nI'm a writer, I am interested in writing and talking. English is not my native language, i like meeting new people and making friends yet It honestly astonishes me how dead people are and shallow their minds are... most of em respond with one word while I'm trying to conversate about anything.. \n\nI am a very open minded person with vast interests and experiences.. try me. talk to me. about anything.. lets get to know eachother.. not gonna try and beg for DMs anymore.. I'm laughing at the inability of everyone of you to communicate. you say people don't talk to you, you're lonely etc.. and you don't take time to appreciate the ones you do.. I understand what the problem is. it's not loneliness.. you crave attention, it makes you feel good. you like to pretend you're a victim but you're the one ignoring all the real connections.. you don't understand what's infront of you.. you're always seeking for something and you don't even know what you want\n\nanyways, I wanted to vent because all my inboxes are waiting on responses.. I don't usually call you motherfuckers out because I don't want to trigger anyone but I don't want to pretend like you're all good people and kiss your asses. \n\nGo to your inbox and respond. I don't mind if i don't remain in this community anymore. I've realised what it's capable of. \ud83d\ude42  \n\nIf you read this you'll probably think I'm crazy but I'm being honest. I challenge any of you to always send a response to me. let's see who's lonely and who's over here seeking attention. Friendship takes effort. if you're lazy, you're not gonna have any meaningful relationships. \ud83d\ude02",

I've only actively been using reddit for about a week to try and make friends and so far 90% of people who say they want to talk just end up not being able to hold a conversation at all.\n\nI get that there's socially awkward/shy folks on here, obviously, but it just feels as though almost nobody puts in any real effort despite their so-called need for friendship.",

While I understand this isn\u2019t what you\u2019re talking about, it definitely gives off a not for me vibe. \n\nPeople are going to ghost. People are going to get scared of getting close to someone and run. \n\nUltimately most of us have shitty social skills because we lack experience talking to other people.

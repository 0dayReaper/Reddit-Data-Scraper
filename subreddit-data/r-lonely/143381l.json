    "postText": "Im 17 and in just a few days i turn 18 and graduate. I have never had a gf and seeing so many cute girls at school is so triggering because i just want to date them and hold them and kiss them and you know actually do what nearly everyone else in my grade does, sounds creepy i know. i dont have crushes on any one and feel i am incapable of love, so its hard to approach anyone number one because i dont know how to talk to people anymore and number 2 i wouldnt know who to pick my standards are not that high and i find like 1 in 4 girls attractive that i see.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo worsen it i have no friends, im Christian, so my options are even more limited and its so depressing when im looking at it i just want to have a girl that loves me and follows the Lord and has my morals. Most girls at my school are completely sexually immoral, and talk about profane things and dont like religion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust very lonely and now i will be able to have a cute high school relationship. Sounds weird, but i never got to date anyone my age, now my only options from now on are adult women, and of course im attracted to them but im a late bloomer and to be honest yes im still attracted to even some freshman now would i ever in my life date them or give them any attention whatsoever? Absolutely not",

    "postText": "I\u2019m Carlos and I work with the youth and produce music on the side. I\u2019m lonely and would like to try a long distance relationship with someone who understands and shares my same struggle. I\u2019m a little bit of a romantic and a big fan of authenticity. \n\nI'm in therapy so we can save money on couples counseling and spend it on our extravagant online ice cream dates. \ud83d\udda4 I\u2019ll stick to therapy, you bring the sprinkles!\n\nInterests: Music, anime, concerts, movies, conventions, true crime, gaming and road trips!",

Just stay keen on long distance relationships man I don\u2019t want to see you get hurt over that. I\u2019d say stick to your passions and eventually someone local will end up developing interest in you. Just wait and be patient don\u2019t chase women, let women chase you.",

It isn't pleasant but I think when we meet people in these kinds of subreddits, we're usually just filling some temporary void or need of theirs until they feel better or \"back to normal\" and move on. \n\nIt's an unpleasant cycle, coming here looking for companionship or just some solidarity then just getting ignored. \n\nIf you want to try again, you can send me a message or something. I'm always around and happy to talk, check my post history if you have any doubts.",

            "comment": "Hey..you sound like someone who is determined to be genuine and one who likes to invest in developing friends and strong acquaintances. In today's world what we miss most is the awareness among individuals that building friendships is not something that can happen automatically. There is need to make huge investments to build that. These investments include, time, mental and physical energy, patience, to some extent loss of privacy (because friendships happen only when one is willing to share), offer genuine care, some willingness to give  etc. Unlike you (as I sensed by reading your post), most (including ones who complain about loneliness, lack of friends etc) are unwilling to make investments of the sort I just described. Add to it, if the individual is a bit shy, reserved and introverted, it becomes doubly difficult to build and sustain friends. These individuals are fearful of failures and rejection and therefore don't even try. With that background, if I were to answer your query as to why individuals often end up ghost you, my guess would be they are seeking some quick remedy to something they are looking for and don't find it in you. They then do not care about making any investments with you and do not care about how you feel about anything etc. They are crude and unworthy of a friendship from a very genuine individual such as you. In any case, wish you best of luck and in case you prefer to chat/discuss etc, please feel free to message me.",

I turned down several women over the years because I love her so much(although now I hate her too), yet she met a guy who tempted her and that was it. \nShe has ruined me; financially, emotionally, sexually and socially. She got rid of my friends so that she could replace them out of insecurity. \nSo now I\u2019m totally fucked. So much for true love and marriage vows/ promises. \nOh, and did I mention that I am terminally ill?",

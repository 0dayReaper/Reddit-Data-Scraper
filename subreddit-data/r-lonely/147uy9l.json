    "postText": "Okay so I heard this the other day and it really struck a cord with me and I've not stopped thinking about it... A quote from somewhere not sure where.... \"There are only 3 things in life that receive unconditional love, women, children, and dogs...\" and they proceed to explain that a man is only loved while he's providing and if someone who can provide more were to ever come along then he is uncerimoniously dumped on the side of the road... and I have spent the better part of 3 hours trying like hell to poke holes in this logic, and the more I try the more solid of a statement I think it really becomes. Does anyone have any insight to this one cause I am at a loss here....",

Had everything and nothing in months... 2008 hit me hard, I was making 100/hr with my IT company had 3 condos 2 that I leased out... My wife at the time started smoking crack with one of my tenants and she started taking money from both my business and my rental properties to the point where I lost both... She was my bookkeeper so I had no idea anything was happening til it was too late. They foreclosed on all my properties repossessed my personal and business vehicles and froze my bank accounts. Granted now I'm back up, I own 2 liquor stores and while its not 100/hr I am comfortable but I will never attempt to be anything more than a provider to myself.... I married twice and that was 2 too many times for me.",

            "comment": "I can think of two ways to look at the statement. \n\n\n1. A literal interpretation, that those three things receive unconditional love.\n\n\nor\n\n2.That those capable of feeling unconditional love, feel it for those 3 things.\n\n\nI'd say that I disagree with both of those.  For the first interpretation, that's easy enough.  There is a large amount of child abuse, animal abuse, and abuse of women in the world.  It's quite clear that a lot of people do not feel unconditional love for them.\n\n\n\n\nAs for the second, I feel that I am fully capable of feeling unconditional love.  I feel it for animals that I've taken care of, for the reason that I feel that the harm they cause is not intentional and they don't understand it, so it's hard to blame them for anything \"bad\" that they do.\n\nI also am capable of feeling it towards people like my parents, because I know that no matter what they do, they're still the reason I exist.\n\nI do not, however, feel it towards women at all.  My love for a woman is fully conditional.  If I'm in a relationship with one, if they cheat or treat me poorly, I stop liking them.",

Fucked up thing is if given the opportunity I'd probably do it again because that's just how it is for me... I dunno though until it comes around again. If....",

And that is only true of the Christian west and some christianized countries in the east.  \n\nThere are plenty of women et al around the world who receive no love. Women and children are easily the most victimized group in some parts of the world. \n\nThe west offers women and children a lot of aid out of sympathy, not love. Unloved women stay unloved.",

I have seen children who were abused. To think that anyone is offered unconditional love is to disregard evidence of the contrary. Now, are those three groups more generally loved than men? I would think so, yes, but that is quite different than having unconditional love.",

I could be being too optimistic but to think that a woman or child or even a dog for that matter only has one person in their lives seems to be a stretch.",

Same too for children, the idea that every parent just loves their child when there is so much contention around having or not having an unwanted pregnancy is just wishful to me. Now, when it comes to women being loved or rather lusted after, yes, women receive the benefit of virtually always having at least one male who sexually wants them, but whether they can translate that lust into affection for them is something that I see many unable to do. Most simply hate being lusted after in the first place,  which is a huge hurdle to gaining affection, but those who hate male lust very often lack in the romantic expertise to seduce affection outside of the bedroom. The coat of armor they wear to disincentivize creeps is the same coat that prevents them from realizing that men want more than just sex.",

I even went back to him several times after he cheated. Love doesnt have a gender I must say. If you love someone you'll do anything dor that person even if it cost you your life. If all of the children receives unconditional love there should be no abused children as well as dogs. it sound so trye but probably most cases are like that i mean it is the norm.",

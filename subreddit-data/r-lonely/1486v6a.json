    "postText": "I feel so freaking alone wherever I go. It's not that anyone actually likes me nor do I have the best social skills but I kinda want someone to just understand how I feel. Like I'm tired of constantly seeing everyone else with their friends in class while I'm just sitting there scrolling through my phone listening into others conversations that I don't care about but I can hear going on around me. Like I have 1 friend but we aren't that close anymore and I don't think it matters that much because they have others that they are closer to. People only talk to me when there friends aren't there, or I was put in a group with them. Nobody actually cares about making friends with me because all they want is small talk because the person they truly want to talk to isn't there.\n\n Like idk I'm so damn done of feeling so damn alone and that everyone is judging me no matter where I am and I don't know what to do about it.",

The feeling that everyone's just tolerating your presence, the sense that you are mearly a fly on the wall. \nIt's not necessarily a bad thing as much as the feeling sucks. It can give you some freedom and it's a good time to really take care of yourself. I personally am trying to exercise and get fit but if that's not your style you can try and find an interest to pursue that allows you to escape and get comfortable with yourself. \nNothing is easy least of all loneliness but it doesn't have to be hard either. \n\nBest of luck to you",

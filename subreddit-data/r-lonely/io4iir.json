Mostly because family either ignored my birthday or took it as an opportunity to cause arguments.\n\nI've learned that some people aren't lucky enough to enjoy something simple that many people take for granted. Not celebrating my birthday avoids the sadness that is associated with it and raises no expectations. Birthdays are just another work day after all. I assume you feel the same way.\n\nJust be nice to yourself. You don't need a birthday to celebrate a good day.",

However by actively holding back, you don't allow people to make an effort. Would it fix it? I can't really say. \n\nBut by choosing to keep it hidden, you make a situation in which no one says anything and you can stay in the idea that no one cares. I know that life and I've lived it. Many people won't give a shit. But for the people that will, you have to offer them the chance to show you they care.",

What I meant by this post was based off times in the past when people did know when my birthday was, but either didn\u2019t say anything or just forgot (which was followed by a waffled apology whenever I brought it up casually in conversation). \n\nI used to get really disappointed when no one said anything so to be honest, I kinda prefer it like this. But by actively choosing to keep it a secret, I definitely get that I shouldn\u2019t expect anyone to remember. That would just be feeling sorry for myself (which I did a lot of).",

If thats what you honestly want I think you need to put some effort into it. It doesnt have to be much. Make it worth remembering is what im saying. You can invite them for a small get together, bring cookies to work or something else. It doesnt have to cost much. Good friends will be happy to spend time with you but you have to show them you care/want to spend time with them also! The people I consider to be my good friends will still forget about my birthday if I dont bring it up. So usually I try and remind them a week or so in advance! That gives them time and if they still dont wish you a happy birthday they might be crappy friends.\n\nThat said its still better to have a crappy friend than being all alone. You might want to try and reach out to other people though, gravitate towards people that makes you happier\n\nTying together with some other comments, if it seems like you dont care about your birthday why would anyone else? If you want people to care about you, you must first show them that you care about yourself. By taking care of yourself and respecting yourself you show others that youre worth their time. Finally I want to ask you if you remember their birthdays? Treat others as you wish others to treat you. That said some of my friends will forget about my birthdays anyways if I dont remind them haha\n\nEdit: happy birthday! \nAlso, pm me if you wanna talk about it or something else.",

Our calendar year is also pretty arbitrary so even if you did try to celebrate 1 complete rotation around the sun, our calendars would not be an accurate tool. Birthdays are overrated. \n\nWhat you really need is a set of people that you run into frequently that make nice small talk with you. The more frequently you are outside for the sake of enjoying yourself, the more likely you are to make friends.\n\n Dont let stupid kids movie influence you perception of what friendship looks like, it isn't always a group of people who practically live together and get along 100% of the time. Sometimes its a classmate or coworker that you enjoy talking to but not outside of school or work. I talk to one of my better friends like once every other month at his shift in the McDonald's drive thru. \n\nDevelop and acknowledge acquaintances and you won't be so lonely.",

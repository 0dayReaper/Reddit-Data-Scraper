    "postText": "With someone who actually has a passion for crocheting or knitting or anything of that sorts. \n\nI find people and then they usually just want to talk sexual or they just want to chat and know nothing about the crafts. The ghosting is fine but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worse than the boyfriend trip wire, is what I\u2019m calling it because it always trips every person I chat with. \n\nThey always think I\u2019m setting some kind of booby trap for them by saying it casually in conversation. For example, I tried to connect with someone and although it wasn\u2019t for crochet they really enjoyed seeing my work and I was happy showing it off but the second they heard I had a boyfriend is all \u201cidkkk this isn\u2019t for me\u201d. If you just wanted to try and swoon me into a relationship by pretending to become my friend first that\u2019s your own hang up.",

Like you said, they lose interest immediately after you say you have a boyfriend \ud83d\ude02. that being said i've read plenty of people made friends on here, too. I also made a friend but in a different subreddit, there's cool people on here but often difficult to find. \ni took a glance at ur profile and you seem to be active in the crocheting sub, i think that might be the best place to meet people that share your passions :)",

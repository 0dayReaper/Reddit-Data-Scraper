No one I can just randomly call or text whenever I feel like it. \n\nIt sounds shallow and needy but sometimes I just want to feel special. I want to feel like somebody is excited to talk to me. I want to experience being somebody's person.\n\nI hope I can get to experience it one day. But for now, I just have to live my life and tell myself it's not a big deal.",

When I was a kid, a \"good\" day for me was to simply be ignored. Not screamed at, not criticized, not belittled. And not hit or abused in other ways.  I learned real fast that the best way to go through life is to be as invisible as possible. Not to put a target on my own back.",

I don't mean that in a bad way, you're human, humans needs attention. It's perfectly fine to acknowledge that you would like attention. It's better, actually, to understand the difference. Why? Because that way you understand whether you really love a person, or just like the attention they give you. That's one that trips a lot of people up.",

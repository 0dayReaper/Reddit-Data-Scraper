I'm tired of always watching other people have their cliques and friend groups. I'm tired of being shoved to the back burner. I'm tired of always being last choice. I'm tired of only being wanted when someone needs a favor. I'm tired of being used. I'm tired of being ignored. I'm SICK AND FUCKING TIRED OF MY PARENTS MAKING EVERYTHING WORSE. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm kind of tired of living in general tbh. I'm probably gonna cut myself after typing this because what the fuck else am I gonna do? I'm an insomniac so sleeping is out of the question. I have no one to talk to. I'm so sick of giving my time and energy to people who never return the effort. It's me, myself,  and I against the world. Fuck everyone else.",

Not happy on this job the expensive car to drive in ain't word working at a company where the CEO is killing the company by not giving his personel the tools to do their job. So I am focussing on money so I can go job Hunt again in a few or even start to work for myself . \n\nSo yeah stop trying to please People and try to make them like you in anyway if you stol focussing on People you can accomplish a lot. The People won't magically find you again if your more successfull but you well eventually meet New People  and you will be relaxed around them .\n\nI been to a festival a few weeks back I talked to a lot of strangers and I never talk to strangers but People were looking for conversation with me for the first time since I finished pre-school\n\nAnd I couldn't care less about them . It's my life I am gonna live it my way and enjoy the ride even if it means being alone for ever",

            "comment": "I definitely understand how you feel. Seems like the story of my life. I care so much about people get attached so easily and pour my heart into things and it doesn't seem to matter. I'm a 36M and I've now reached the point that you have. Fuck relationships, fuck even trying any more. I've decided I'm just going to be alone. But I will tell you it's not so bad.\n\nLast year I finally got out of a toxic relationship of 3 years. I dated a woman who constantly belittled me, insulted me, etc, and that was when she was willing to spend time with me.  I would have to beg to spend time with her and I was always her lowest priority. I'm almost completely certain that she was having an affair or multiple affairs throughout the relationship though I never had any definitive proof of it, but to me her words and actions, and how she treated me were proof enough. \n\nI thought that if I tried harder and told her how I felt it would change things but honestly it just made things worse. Times I did open up and be vulnerable with her she would usually end up twisting my words and use them against me. The emotional abuse was constant. Honestly what I'm writing here is just the shortened version. I could probably write a book about her mistreatment. I didn't leave because I had no one else.\n\nI started drinking more looking for an escape. As a result I ended up being arrested twice last year. She lied to the cops and said I tried to strangle her. I was charged with a felony which luckily I beat. I had to spend two months in jail as a result of all the legal trouble. I had to resign from my job where I was making over 100K a year. Currently I still don't have a job. \n\nMy point is: being in a relationship can sometimes be worse. Romantic or otherwise. Honestly I felt more alone being in that relationship than I ever have my entire life. Be careful who you let into your life. Dating her really fucked up my life in a serious way. If people don't truly care about you they will fuck you over in a heartbeat. Being alone isn't as bad as you think.\n\nYou are still so young. You still have a lot of learning and growing up to do. If people don't want to hang out with you and don't see what a good friend you are, then fuck 'em, like you said. People will find you and value you for who you really are. It might take time, but this situation you're in right now is not permanent. Things will get better. See what you can do to make a change. If you don't like living with your parents start making a plan to move out.  Make a budget to see how much it'll cost to live on your own, get a job, and find a place you can afford. You might have to look for a roommate online, but again be careful about who you invite into your life.\n\nDon't hurt yourself and don't resort to self destructive behaviors. (I know I'm not one to talk based on me trying to drink to escape) But If you cut yourself you're going to have those scars for the rest of your life. I still have scars on my arms from when I was 15 years old. Or worse you could die. If you want to feel some pain at least make it productive. Go do some exercise. Go run until your lungs burn and you can't run any more.\n\nFind things you like to do when you are alone and be grateful for your alone time. Read a book, learn an instrument, pick up a new hobby, or just get on reddit and write annoying long comments lol.\n\nTL;DR Some friendships/relationships are worse than being alone.",

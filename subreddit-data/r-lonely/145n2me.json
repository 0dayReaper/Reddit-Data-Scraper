    "postText": "Sunday marks a year that I miss carried my baby.. I thought I dealt with my feelings about it but clearly not. Ive been having these crazy panic attacks that I can\u2019t even explain why i even feel this way.\n\nI have an event tomorrow and i really rather be in bed all weekend. But, noone is going to understand why i bailed. I\u2019ll just look like the bad guy for cancelling last minute.\n\nThe only person i could talk to about how i feel is my ex only cause it was his baby to but, he left me after a loss the baby and I don\u2019t want him thinking I \u201cneed him.\u201d\n\nI just want to scream I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me..",

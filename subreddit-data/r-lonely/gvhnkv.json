Some may not talk as much to you bc they just don't know what to talk about or are just very introverted. That is why having a number of online friends helps when you can just talk to another person.\n\nPerseverance is also an important thing.

It's the absolute hardest part about a break up, when you're still in love with them and your not even a blip on their radar anymore. \nI think about her every day, just our talks, our chats, what we shared and laughed at, the times I was there for her when she was stressed or upset. And just knowing that I never meant anything to her, that it meant the world to me, but it didn't to her. It's the worst, I feel so abandoned and depressed. All I wanted was to be cared about.",

    "postText": "Where do I start, I have three wonderful kids but my wife decided she wanted to leave me about 18 months ago. \n\nWe still live together as we have financial commitments (mortgage, nursery/daycare, etc) and I\u2019ve never felt more lonely than I do now. \n\nI have recently been on a weekend away to Le Mans for the 24 hr race and was extremely envious of the guys getting lovely messages from their wife\u2019s and kids. I\u2019m tearing up as I write this. Even if nobody sees this post, I needed to express this in some form. \n\nComing home to see someone who you still love that doesn\u2019t love you back and would be gone if it wasn\u2019t for finances is definitely one of the saddest things I hope I ever experience.",

    "postText": "I miss my ex girlfriend from 5 years ago so much it hurts physically. I've developed a number of serious addictions in the 5 years since we brol up and gotten clean a few times. I go to 12 step meetings now. I just still hurt so bad and in sobriety I feel it all again, I'll be 30 this year and I feel like my life is not worth living anymore tonight. I don't plan to act on those feelings but damn it's hard tonight.",

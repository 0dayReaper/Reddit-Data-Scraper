    "postText": "I recently had a falling out with some friends in which some proceeded to tell me I would die a virgin because of my looks. It was very cutting, and since then, I really haven\u2019t felt like myself at all. I just want to live life, and I simply can\u2019t get their comments out of my head. They insulted my hair, my jaw, my beard, it was like middle school all over again but I\u2019m 22. Gonna be entering med school soon and I haven\u2019t spent a spare hour obsessing over about 50 new insecurities that popped into existence that day like a teenage girl. I really can\u2019t live like this. Could somebody give me an objective look in DMs?\n\nThe mirror is my enemy. And my camera. I\u2019ve probably taken 10k+ pictures over the last year, they knew I was fucked in the brain about my appearance but I only brought it up once and generally tried to hide it as much as possible. They knew it would hurt me more than anything else besides throwing me in a meat grinder.",

But just remember one thing, when people say things spitefully it's not necessarily true, in fact 90% of the time, it's false. Don't lose hope OP, you won't die alone or as a virgin.",

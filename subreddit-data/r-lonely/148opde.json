    "postText": "I'm a 17 year old boy. I'm pretty happy with almost every aspect in my life: I have a few good friends, I have a hobby, I have a family and I'm in a school. The thing is, I feel like it's pretty much impossible for me to get a relationship anymore in this state of my life. \n\nI live in a very small town. Everyone always tells me to just go out there and things will start happening. However, when I go out with my friends, they are the only ones I will meet. Even if we do happen to stumble across someone, we very much know each other already and a thought of anything else than being friends or remaining as strangers will not cross either of our's mind, as we already know that it's not possible. It's just the way things are in a small town.\n\nHowever, a part of me still believes that it can't be the case. Everyone else has had a relationship at one point of their lives, why haven't I? I do acknowledge that my position isn't the most typical one: I only want to be in a relationship where our personalities compliment each other. As I am very much an introvert and probably considered weird by quite many, I'm therefore not going to find many people like me here.  If I moved to a bigger town to study in a place that emphatizes on my hobby (that was, in fact, a possibility), I would have met more people matching my personality. That option didn't happen, as other things blocked that opportunity.\n\nAt one point I thought that I really must be the problem. Then I started going out more, trying to be more positive and socialize more. I have succeeded in those things, but nothing has changed. I would really love to be in a relationship, because it would be adream come true to just have someone to talk about pretty much everything and go together through the struggles. I guess that just won't happen. I'm sorry if this post seems out of place. Things could be so much worse, but this is something that has been bothering me and I needed to share it.",

    "postText": "I'm (23M) in a very stressful time of my life because I'm finishing my BSc. I'm also a very lonely person as I had an almost non existent social life after the pandemic ended, not that before anything exciting ever happened. \n\nBut last november I tried some dating apps because I wanted to try something that could make my life less miserable. Nedless to say that I stopped using Bumble after having zero results because I really put no effort into it, but just out of boredom I sometimes swipe some profiles without any expectation and some weeks ago I matched with this girl my age who's studying in my country. We actually met and it went great, had really good chemistry, it ended with a kiss and afterwards we were texting a lot and I found that she basically had all the things that I was looking for: exceptionally kind and caring, thoughtful with tons of interests in common and things to talk about, very sweet, fragile and had a really sensitive soul. Also she disliked social media culture and told me she was insecure about the fact that she never had a boyfriend. I thought I finally found the one who could understand me and maybe even make my life a little more bearable.\n\nSo one week later we arranged another date and I absolutely ruined it because I have a skin disease that most of the time I can keep under control (it is one of the main causes of my loneliness too) and it was quite bad that day so I was extremely anxious and generally stressed, so obviously everything went wrong and as I was conscious of the bad experience I did the mistake of asking her in the end how she felt about me and she said that as she was staying here for only two months she didn't know and wasn't sure she had strong feelings for me. She said that she already understood that I was very attracted to her and that even if she didn't know if she had feelings for me it wasn't always true that they couldn't be developed. So I saw that as a friendzone and I said that I would have trouble seeing her again as we had very different feelings about each other and she was unsure about this whole thing. \n\nIt was a very emotional goodbye and she actually cried as even if we've met only two times we had a strong connection, so many things in common and a very similar way of experiencing life. Fast forward to today and I can't stop thinking about her because I never met anyone like her in my whole life and I feel like she was exactly what I was looking for. At the same time I know I have to move on, but I don't think I will ever meet someone like her because I know how precious and rare she was.\n\nTL;DR  met a girl that I found perfect, ruined everything because I'm too emotional and insecure, I'm now completely alone again but I feel even worse about it.",

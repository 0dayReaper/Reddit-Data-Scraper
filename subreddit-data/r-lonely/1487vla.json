I enjoy making music, gaming, nerdy stuff like Harry Potter, reading, economy, cooking, animals, nature, being outdoor and exploring, minimalism. I just don\u2019t like the things most people like (drinking, shopping, partying - lame).\n\nWhat about you?",

            "comment": "I truly believe the answer to your question depends on how you placed yourself in the box for which you currently reside. You know that you have suffered in some way, but have you attached meaning to that suffering? For example, if you are in school is it worth suffering through studying to ideally do better at a test but without a guarantee that your study time will generate better test results? Alternatively, is it worth facing rejection of your ego to pursue someone who will love on the most real version of you that you can stomach putting out there? \n\nAnyone focused solely on an outcome will do everything in their power to manipulate the world to achieve the outcome. The richest people in the world are despised often for the ways in which their ambition actively harms others. If you wish to avoid being like them, it means rejecting to the highest extent possible using lies to achieve your goals and if you run into strong rejection then be willing to take that feedback to make the small changes necessary to be more comfortable to be around. How you do all this seems to vary person by person, but I do honestly believe that it is more helpful to risk being your authentic self if you wish to attract those who would stand by it.",

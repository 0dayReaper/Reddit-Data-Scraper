I had noticed one guy kept to himself a lot, kind of like me. He didn't seem to have close friends in the class at least. But I ended up scooting closer to him and pairing up rather than try to pair up with someone next to me. For the first time I heard him talk about some things and he was well spoken lol. Anyway he seemed to lighten up and I hope it made his day I guess. ",

Talking to her was so easy, it felt so fun, we talked about so many in-depth concepts revolving the situation she was going through, and I admired how brave she was going through what she was. The story ended badly but the moments when it was just us in our own little bubble was nice, I haven\u2019t had the connection with someone in a while.",

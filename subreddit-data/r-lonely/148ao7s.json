    "postText": "hey so me and my girlfriend have been dating for about a year now, she just turned 20 the other week and i turned 19 a few months ago. i\u2019ll say this before everything my girlfriend is autistic and very depressed. but yea here we go. \nat the start of our relationship she was very affectionate and loving, although showing her moments of being dissociated and not caring. but recently she\u2019s been completely zoned out, not really saying anything to me, just sitting on her phone the whole time when we hang out, and never initiates our hello/goodbye kiss. it\u2019s also been months without sex and she even says she might be going asexual. this is all just a big switch for me compared to what we were when we started the relationship, she even used to be hyper sexual and affectionate. i\u2019m just confused. i love her so much. we\u2019ve always laughed and joked whenever we we\u2019re together but recently that\u2019s all we do if not sit in silence / watch stuff / play the game. idk it\u2019s kinda just felt like shes soft broken up with me or something\u2026 feeling lonely. what do y\u2019all think? i\u2019ve never ever thought about breaking up with her but i\u2019m beginning to get worried this isn\u2019t a phase.",

            "comment": "Well, you already gave two hints. \nFirst of all, you say she is autistic. Secondly, she is depressed. So she is neurodivergent and in general a low wave/bad mood can be a total mood and affection killer. \nMaybe she didn't have a depressive phase when you two got together, maybe your relationship lifter her mood. But thata the problem with autism and depression. It's a spectrum with big differing variables when it comes to thinking, behaviourisms etc. \n\nWe don't know what meds she takes, and we also don't know if she goes to therapy. \nDid you know that such phases can go on for months? That being with a depressed person isn't really something you can put sense to. \nIt's hard to expect something normal from someone who is by every matter of a definition, not in a normal condition. \n\nSo before you ask if your gf is soft breaking up with you because she is distant and isn't in the mood. \nMaybe look at the meds, options for counseling try to participate more actively and change up the routine you are having (like going on dates, planning certain trips etc). \n\nAnd don't judge her under the umbrella of what she is able to do when she was \"normal\" since she isn't. \nAccept that as long as she is depressed and especially if she is autistic. Certain things will never be \"normal\" and shouldn't be judged like you would everyone else. \n\nMaybe ask yourself if you can support her through her lows for another few months. \nAsk what you need. \nAnd maybe sit down and talk it out. \nI have a feeling you don't really talk about how to communicate in such times. \nMaybe it's better you sit down and she can be honest when she needs alone time, that she tells you when she is ready or not so you don't have to ask, that you try through questions get a grasp what is ok and what isn't. And through certain  words or key phrases find out where she is at mentally right now. \nSo if we go by traffic light principle \nGreen - good mood, can take her on a date \nYellow - we need to figure out what she wants and what she can do\nRed - better don't expect anything just be there or leave her alone. \n\nCommunication. Is. Key.",

            "comment": "This question is probably better suited in r/relationship_advice\n\nHowever, relationships need open and honest communication to even have a hope of surviving. If you haven't discussed with her everything you mentioned here, I suggest doing it now. \n\nTry starting with \"Is there anything I can do for you?\" It's a nice way to start a difficult conversation, and it will let her know you care and want to *help* her get back to her usual self. \n\nOf course, only ask if you mean it, and if you're truly ready to hear the answer.",

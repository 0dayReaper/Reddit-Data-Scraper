I have a few friends and 2 close friends but the thought of initiating a conversation with them drains me by the time I go on to WhatsApp. Like what is there to ask other than \"How's it going?\" because it's freaking Covid and Malaysia is having a total lockdown so we couldn't hang out or go anywhere for new experiences to talk about without risking infections or burning our paychecks over unjust fines. And whenever I do get all excited about something I did and shared it out, the enthusiasm fizzles off after a couple short exchanges.  \n\n\nI get people have their own lives and shit, but there's always this internal struggle with rationality whereby I *want* to socialise yet I *want* them to initiate and keep it going. I don't usually tell anyone that I'd prefer them to put in a bit more effort even if it's texting/calling or organising a meetup, but damn if I could just dismiss the whole consideration and sensibility over their time/personal life struggles, I'd call them out for their excuses. Like no I don't want to be the person who has to understand every time you're busy/depressed and need solo time but god damn it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe idea of going on to dating/social apps is unnerving, exhausting yet tempting but the thought of starting all over with a stranger is a stumbling block for my motivation to get off my lonely ass and reach out.",

No explanation, thought we were really good friends. From texting all day to nothing. I won't text back first. Deleted her number to be sure I wouldn't. It was helping me through a lot(we both have depression and would always cheer eachother up). Even if it was just joking about stuff, knowing it would brighten our day. Poof. Gone. Ouch.

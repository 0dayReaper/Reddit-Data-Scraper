    "postText": "I\u2019m 23F and have no close friends to confide in, lean on when I need support or just experience this period of youth together which people keep saying it\u2019s supposed to be incredible. After being in a situation where I stood up to my previous friends who walked all over me they tried to isolate me from the rest of the group, and I lost my entire group of friends. This hurt me in ways I can\u2019t describe when I invested so much in these friends for years since the start and always supported them in every way I could. As a kid I always imagined my life in early 20s would automatically be genuinely amazing with a close knit group of friends to celebrate and have fun and party and most importantly make intimate memories I would treasure. Now I come across these cool concert events or places or milestones in life and it hurts to think there\u2019s not one person I can immediately call up. Everytime I hear people say these should be the \u201cbest years of your life\u201d my heart sinks. It\u2019s one of the worst feelings that you lost out on an experience of youth everyone else seemed to effortlessly experience, especially the gut wrenching sense of guilt and loss that you\u2019re somehow the one to blame for being alone despite being giving and caring. I just somehow feel like a failure for reaching this point in life.",

I\u2019m currently in the midst of making a major lifestyle change and I know having an intimate partner would make it a lot easier out at least make it worth trusting through the pain. \n\nFriends I believe aren\u2019t a problem for me. I have a lot of people I can spend time with although I prefer to be alone the majority of the time. So when I need to exercise the social part of my brain, I know I can connect with someone my personality type vibes with best. I know what I enjoy and I know what don\u2019t. The biggest challenge is healing from my PTSD/CPTSD and it\u2019s especially more difficult juggling adhd (w/o medication because they made me more anxious). Anyway, thank you for sharing.

And if you're a guy you're doubly fucked because as a man in this society no one ever teaches you how to reach out to others and form close friendships, or how to express your emotions, so you spend all your time bitter and angry which just drives a wedge even farther between yourself and the rest of the world.

But it's not like I've spent the last 20 years alone, I have had relationships it's just that none of them worked out, i.e. I ended up getting cheated on and now I have trust issues on top of being completely unable to meet people.\n\nI don't feel like giving up is the answer though. I don't know what the answer is but that seems like a slippery slope. Once you've completely given up then what's the point of going on? But, finding a way to be happy with where you are in life is important for everyone and something I definitely struggle with.",

I would see groups of friends go past on their way to have fun in the sun at the beach and it was a feeling of almost physical pain. My mother would bully me and I was convinced it was me, I was unlikable, unlovable. It's actually extremely common for the early 20's to be a lonely time. If you've left school and your peer group.\n\nI'm so sorry to hear about your friends hurting you. Now, it taken me a long while to know this, but here's the thing, being a caring person can sometimes attract the wrong types. I'm not saying don't be your caring self. But that's the first thing. Please please don't blame yourself.\n\nI remember feeling deeply lonely and reading a lovely article from a college counsellor from a country far away and it talked about feeling bad about being lonely, blaming ourselves makes it a lot worse.\n\nI'm not sure of your situation but I'd be willing to guess a lot of it is WHERE you are, not who you are. You sound like a nice kind person. It sounds more like it might be your current situation. Are there things you can do to reach out? Or join clubs or other similar things?\n\nP.S. I remember I did get away from my bully parents and made friends. It was amazing and I realised it wasn't me...it was more my situation.",

There are only a few that party, go out with friends and have the \"perfect\" life for someone in the early 20's. \n\nThat being said. You stood up for yourself instead of leting them run over you. YOU have the right courage and strength to do so. At some point in life they will face the same \"issues\" as you.\n\nI recommend that you try and stay positive. Don't just think about the big picture but also the small like nice dinner, watching netflix or visiting family.

Thats why i travelling  in the longterm for me seems like an impact to one's lasting friendships.\n\nMaybe thats a difference of perception or maybe i'm still trying to figure that out. Having things in common sometimes works the opposite way for me. It makes it so that your not able to hear other oppinions and other voices and interests. It creates a so called 'bubble' but maybe thats just me. Although maybe I am wrong about that and still have to figure that out. Im only in my early 20's.\n\nDont you think so? \n\nAfter all your the one with more life exoerience.",

The end will be like the beginning: he has made friends with one who might assist him out of bondage; at the first rattle of the chain such a friend will desert him. These are the so-called \u201cfair-weather\u201d friendships; one who is chosen for the sake of utility will be satisfactory only so long as he is useful. Hence prosperous men are blockaded by troops of friends; but those who have failed stand amid vast loneliness their friends fleeing from the very crisis which is to test their worth. Hence, also, we notice those many shameful cases of persons who, through fear, desert or betray. The beginning and the end cannot but harmonize. He who begins to be your friend because it pays will also cease because it pays. A man will be attracted by some reward offered in exchange for his friendship, if he be attracted by aught in friendship other than friendship itself.\"\n\nI really hope it'll get better for you soon, sadisticly enough theres a certain freedom in having nothing left to lose. (Yes thats a Janis Joplin reference)\n\nHave you thought about seeking professional help? It's really not a shame to do so and if you really need someone to talk to, thats probably the safest place you can go by far. They're trained to listen. Its hard to admit that you might need help. But it's really not a shame. Getting raped isn't something mild, it affects a persons trust more then anything else.",

I relate with what you\u2019ve been going through (especially with being ostracized by friends for asserting boundaries/standing up for yourself). I\u2019ve kept going now for almost a decade without friends. I know it\u2019s hard to believe, but you are NOT a failure for not having friends. Your worth as a human being doesn\u2019t depend on whether or not people like/love or dislike/hate you. You are just as worthy and deserving as any human being on this planet. Being alone/lonely is hard. It\u2019s also the perfect time to use for healing and nurturing self, and practicing self-love. And yes, you\u2019re absolutely allowed to feel the way you do - self love doesn\u2019t fix everything, like loneliness/being alone. But it can help cement boundaries with yourself and others so the next people you connect with don\u2019t end up hurting you the way your past friends did. Self love doesn\u2019t take away the hurt, but it can help soothe and ease it. It\u2019s harder to heal when you\u2019re your own enemy, and being harsh/critical with yourself. There is so much in life to explore and enjoy - like trying new hobbies, interests. It can be really simple stuff like eating that one dish you haven\u2019t cooked before. Or drinking a cup of coffee at a cozy cafe. I guarantee that if you explore and go on adventures (no matter how big or small), you will eventually meet people who are a good fit for you. I hope you fill your life with what you enjoy, brings peace &amp; happiness. And I hope with that brings you on the same path to intimate, safe, healthy relationships.\n\nEdit: clean up",

Because lockdown happened literally a week after my 20th birthday, I still don't know if its lockdown thats making my mental health bad or my 20's are affecting my mental health. \n\nKeep in mind that many/most people are not having an \"effortless experience\". People post things online, and the reality can be quite different. I think life nowadays is expected to be perfect, that we forget the purpose of life. For hundreds and thousands of years, life was so awful and you would be lucky to make it to your 20's. Nowadays with medicine and diet and technology, life has extended so much and basically no one is dying until their 70's. Also, since the dawn of humanity, women started having babies in their late teens/early 20's, so you spent your 20's raising your babies. We are also one of the first few generations where we have a childfree 20's and even 30's sometimes. Life has changed so much in the last probably 50 years.\n\nJust know you are not alone in feeling the way you are, don't blame yourself for anything, you have done nothing wrong at all\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c",

For awhile every time one of my friends when on a date or hooked up with someone, I would feel very angry about the fact that I was alone. Today I have channeled that frustration into weight lifting and photography. I might still be alone but I am working on making myself into a better person, character wise and physically",

            "comment": "I feel the same buddy. It sucks. I have no money, I live in a very small town, and all my friends from high school live far away from where I live (I'm an incoming college freshman.) \n  Sometimes I hear other people talk about their adventures (mostly involving drinking or some stupid juvenile thing) and I have none of that. I'm poor so I have to get my shit together lest I be damned in the future. It sucks. I'm young. I wanna just chill and live life for the moment. But I can't.\n Idk tho, there are times when I'm absolutely fine with it anyway, and times when it hurts real bad. Solitude is a weird thing. \n I think you should spend your current time working on a purpose, no matter how stupid you might think it is. U only get one life, and all of this might sound hypocritical coming from me, but there probably is no real reason to compare urself to other's lives. Friends and memories are good, they might even be essential to an extent, but so is purpose. The thing with working on your purpose is, you have to do it alone, since we are who we truly are only when in solitude. \n What if years from now, u find urself with friends, a good partner, and an amazing social life? Would that be enough compensation? \n Einstein said \"I lived in that solitude which was painful in youth but sweet in maturity.\" That's fucking Einstein right there. He might've missed out on some things, but he sure as hell lived one helluva life. Hugh Hefner, the founder of playboy, wasn't a real partyer and a virgin at 22! And yet he lived the rest of his life partying and having sex. I think that's more than enough compensation.\n \nI guess what I'm saying is that it is absolutely possible that the life you are dreaming of, that of which there are friends and companions, is just a few years from now from being a reality. Hang in there, do your best to take care of your mental health for the moment, so you're in the right frame of mind once the right opportunity comes. \n\nFuck the past, all that's there and will ever be is what's Infront of you.",

Those are intrusive thoughts. We all have this terribly mean inner voice and in my later 20s, I\u2019m finally learning to identify it and fight it. A therapist on instagram said to give that voice a name (mine is Coco bc that was the name of a bully in HS) and tell myself, Coco is not me and Coco is a liar. It\u2019s been helping me a bit. Sending positive energy your way. I believe it will get better, it has for me!",

I left my first relationship when I realized it was bad for me and making me miserable and isolated. I know how you feel, and it's not your fault. I am lucky enough to say that I do have people in my life to talk to who love me, but there were many months of my life where I felt like I had no one I really connected with and it's the worst feeling.\n\nMessage me if you feel like talking more.",

But i didn't avoid my best frd at any cost and talked same....and my LDR was also not so good and most of the time it was just fights fights...alone..... But after 1.5 yrs in lockdown...still in lockdown relationship broke...out of over stress... mutually.. She wasn't my type i wasn't her type... That's why so many fights....and u know what... My best friend also left....we started having fights and egos...and much more....even though i go and convince after a fight , all i got was humiliation , so that's it... feeling LONELY for the first time , so badly as im not a type of person with many frds and i hadn't had more than 4 good frds in any time.....he was my best one..... now being not able to connect to anyone similarly , coz i had experienced the before one....and unfortunately my home was also not a very nice place to communicate in a happy manner , so stuck up and feeling Wrecked daily by seeing other peoples stories enjoying their 20s while im sitting in home with not developing me , not enjoying 20s and most importantly with no close friends",

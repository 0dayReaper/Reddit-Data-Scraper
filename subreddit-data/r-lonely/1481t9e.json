    "postText": "It's funny I met this interesting, intelligent,  beautiful woman off of this platform. We had several conversations and I enjoyed each one. We are both married and she must feel lonely also because she was on the same chat. But then she just stopped talking. \n\nI guess ghosted is the word? It made me feel terrible. Funny part was we never shared any kind of sexual banter we were just talking about our relationship with our spouse. It was nice just having her to talk with, she lived in England and me in the US. But again it made feel rejected like in my relationship with my wife.",

    "postText": "Every time a person who is depressed or lonely tries to get help, people trivialize their problems and gaslight them and teach them comforting lies and false hope, only for us to realize in the end they lied. \n\nEvery time we talk to someone, they minimize our problems. You are 30 and never had a gf/bf and never could date or lose your virginity. They say \u201ctHeRe\u2019S mOrE tO LiFe tHaN sEx aNd dAtInG\u201d and these are the people who get depressed over a breakup or who won\u2019t date a virgin because they cannot handle teaching you or who get dates regularly and don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like in your shoes\n\nYou tell them you never made friends and are socially isolated and others have pics of them doing fun stuff online they say \u201cbut but those are just the highlights\u201d even though their highlights are far more exciting than anything that occurs in your life and then they say \u201cBuT yOu dOn\u2019T kNoW wHaT gOeS oN iN tHeIr LiFe hOw Do yOu kNoW ThEy\u2019Re hApPy?\u201d And how do you know they\u2019re just as miserable? Some might be miserable but a majority I\u2019m sure are pretty happy and definitely way happier than an extrovert who is socially isolated with an uneventful life.\n\nThey tell us that friends, social events etc aren\u2019t that fun and we aren\u2019t missing much even though people throw these events to celebrate special holidays or their birthday. For example, if parties are boring, why do people go them all the time including after trying them out for the first time? If they sucked they wouldn\u2019t go over and over again? Why would they throw them when celebrating a holiday or graduation or their own birthday? If hanging out with your friends isn\u2019t so fun why do people do it so much? If concerts and bars aren\u2019t fun why do people go to them all the time? \n\nInstead of helping you make new friends or find a partner or go to a fun event like a concert they just trivialize your problems.\n\nThese are the same people who went insane under quarantine. At least they had friends and a social life prior to covid while a lot of people here never did. And despite being unable to handle the tip of the iceberg of what socially isolated people dealt with they gave the audacity to trivialize our problems \n\nThis is why depressed or lonely or suicidal people don\u2019t get help. Even if they knew you won\u2019t stigmatize them for being depressed they still won\u2019t talk to you knowing you\u2019ll gaslight them or trivialize their problems. \n\nThis is why the suicide rate and depression rate has skyrocketed despite campaigns and people \u201ctrying\u201d to prevent suicide/depression.",

But then I got older and my situation changed. I changed. I became an extrovert once I found a community I felt I belonged and was supported in. Most people can be an introvert or extrovert and it just depends on their current situation and ability to recognize new opportunities.",

But I would say the same is true of ourselves. We are always our own harshest critics, and we have trouble looking at others successes and seeing that potential in ourselves. But our problems and hardships are not entirely unique to us. The same reason theres no truly new plots in hollywood, all the stories have been told and are now just being retold with different spins. Everything we face, others have faced in some form or another, and of those some have overcome them, and some have fallen to them.\n\nDont let anyone diminish your pain or struggles. But dont let yourself diminish your strength or potential either. You've survived it this long havent you? That doesnt make it subjectively suck any less, it means that you have been equal to it thus far. Even in this craptastic world, making friends is still possible, and there are still people out there that care for their fellow homo sapien. Not everyone is going to be president, but possibilities like friends and happiness are open to everyone. Its just a matter of finding ones individual path to reach them. But no amount of \"just try harder\" is going to do anything until you let yourself see that the goal is actually possible. Not necessarily easy or simple, just possible.",

Most normals don't know how to help someone who's screwed up. They don't know how simple it can be to help someone like that. Either that or they don't care. Sometimes, just hearing someone say something positive about you, or maybe just a hug can make things so much better. But people don't care. Or don't know. It's terrible to think that some people who also feel this way don't have anyone to help them fight their demons. I'm lucky to have friends that I can call upon when I need to talk. They might live happier existences and not deal with the same problems, but they help nonetheless, and I'm lucky that I have such valuable friends.

I didn't allow myself one bit of self-pity or self-empathy, because I was terrified it would turn into giving up. Now I realize that although I thought I was the shit, I was just pretending I thought I was perfect as an attempt to cover up the actual serious unease I was feeling about my life and the serious issues I was going through. You might think you love yourself, but people who love themselves always, without a single exception, love others. And this doesn't mean obsessing over them or wanting to \"get\" them as friends or lovers, it means completely selfless love without expecting ANYTHING back. If you perform those completely selfless acts of love daily (of any size), you can reliably say you love yourself. If not, you might want to change some things in your life so you do.",

But you're not being tortured, you're lonely, which sucks absolute ass but the reality is you can still go have a conversation with a nice obliging person at a bar. If you're incredibly socially awkward, that conversation will probably only last ten minutes after it becomes too uncomfortable for the other person, but exposure therapy will allow you to improve your social skills and not weird people out. You can talk to a therapist, make friends online on a subreddit like this, join clubs about things you're passionate about, join a metal band, whatever. there are options here, you're just incredibly attached to the concept that there's something wrong with you. have you seen the people that get famous or some of the people with tons of friends? ugly, creepy, weird ass people. like tekashi69, say. but simply because they believe in themselves and don't take no for an answer, they make their dreams come true.

What about this happening in the 1900s? Nope. First of all that\u2019s a logical fallacy called appeal to worse problems. Second, studies show that college students are less empathetic than they were in the 1980s/1990s. It had a sample size of 14,000.\n\n\u201cNot everything can be blamed on others\u201d Many things can. And yes, people showing lack of empathy and teaching false hope and trivializing your issues definitely causes a lot of harm\n\nActually people do owe us empathy and help. Caring about yourself doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t care about others. If people don\u2019t owe us help or empathy then that implies it\u2019s ok for us to receive no help or empathy from others. Without help or empathy we are all alone and when we struggle on our own where else can we go? You cannot expect people to figure out their issues on their own. That\u2019s why we try to talk to others. So when humans don\u2019t help us we go deeper in our black hole. Horrible things happen without empathy or help from others.

What is it you think gets most people through the day every day? Comforting lies and false hope.\n\nOr, rather, comforting thoughts and hope, if we frame it less pessimistically. \n\nHappy people are happy because they learn how to frame their lives in a positive way. They're basically practicing what we teach in cognitive behavioral therapy. They look on the bright side. They don't fixate on the negative. They have overarching goals that keep them too busy to become morosely philosophical on their circumstances.\n\nWhy do you think religion is so popular? Why do you think it correlates so well with success markers, like marriage and high income brackets? It's because being able to believe in comforting lies really does help. Positivity actually assists your success. A positive person can work harder for longer, and endure more failure.\n\nSo yes, stop looking down on the energy these people are putting in to try to make you feel better. They can't fix your problems for you, and you shouldn't expect them to. It's time to pick yourself up and work on your goals until you succeed or die trying. Sitting here complaining about other people isn't going to fix anything for you, so stop wasting your time and go do something about it.",

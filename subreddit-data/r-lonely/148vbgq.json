    "postText": "so ive been really trying to do my best to go out and do things and make plans with the few friends i do have to strengthen the friendships i have and hopefully make new friends too. so tonight me and a few friends were supposed to go to the drive in. i asked day of making plans if they needed a ride. they said no. i said okay if thay changes let me know i will get you. so tonight rolls around and ive tried getting a hold of them. no answer for hours until i arrive at the drive in. apparently they couldn't get a ride, and they tried all day to find one. i told them i could give them a ride. so why do they just inform night of like 20 mins til the movie they couldn't a ride. i even texted back saying i could still get them and take them home afterwards but no response. i honestly feel so defeated. people wonder why i don't try anymore to make plans and this is why. this always happens to me. i dunno i just needed somewhere to vent as i am laying in my truck, under the dark sky all alone, trying to keep it together and not cry.",

    "postText": "I've been done with life for awhile now I just don't like the idea of there being nothing once I do the inevitable. That this is all there is. And there actually are reasons to stay alive but that's even more reason to leave being I recognize that and yet it makes no difference. Everything in the vain of holding onto life feels like a lie...every fucking post I make is me wishing for death one way or another...I feel like I'm stuck here... living- forced fucking convincing and I'm beyooooond fucking tired lol. Tired of laughing from being at a loss...I just want the world to end or for me to die in my sleep....it feels so fucking peaceful imagining haha",

The error bar was less than 5% here for instance. It was also done by Pew Research, who have a reputation for being fair, reliable, and accurate with their data.\n\nAnd age is important (which I think is responsible for most of the skew): 63% of men aged 18-29 are single but only 25% of men 30-49 are (still far more than single women that age however). I think women are attracted to stability and confidence, which older men are more likely to have so that's responsible for a lot of the skew. But since the average age gap tends to be 2-3 years, it doesn't explain it entirely. I think their methodology should have removed those \" men and women define single in a different way\" since they had a very strict and clear definition of single which wasn't that ambiguous. I think many women choosing to date a subset of attractive men (as shown in online dating) might be responsible for the rest of the skew. \n\nAt least, it gets better with age I suppose...",

Women (especially on Reddit) constantly complain about men approaching them IRL and clearly hate it most of the time. Socially awkward guys feel even more discouraged pursuing anything to avoid even the slightest hint of appearing creepy so they never learn how to approach women at all. And if you start off as friends first, women complain that they only got into the friendship in hopes of a romantic relationship and feel hurt. At least in dating apps, you know the other person is open to being approached romantically.\n3. It's true in the real world too. If only \\~30% of young women are single compared to \\~60% of young men, then male abundance isn't just a problem online. Just aren't enough single women to go around in that age group. Fortunately, it gets slightly better after 30 (the gap still remains though).\n4. I wish we could have a world men's meeting where we agree that we all will collectively have higher standards. Tell me how I can make a billion men agree to something (that's against their short-term interest, mind you) and I promise I'll make all the men stop complaining about this.\n5. Men aren't mad at women for this (mostly). It's not their fault. Just biology and social conditioning. Sucks to be on the wrong end of it though. Nature is a cruel bitch.",

I added the second para later.\n\nYou didn't even reply to any of the points. Weird...\n\nEDIT: My edit was posted 16 hours back. OP's comment was posted 15 hours back and she accuses me of editing it after her's. Make up your own minds about what happened.",

I did respond to your points. If you\u2019re so mad about women having options, just make yourself a better and attentive lover that someone would wanna stick with you instead of exploring further. And also, maybe men should be more picky and not bombard women.\n\nOkay and why did you edit out the percentages and dating apps in your second comment?",

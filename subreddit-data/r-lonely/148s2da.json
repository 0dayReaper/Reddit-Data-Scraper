    "postText": "Missed my chance. I\u2019ve been quiet and shy my entire life and I missed my chance to form relationships. Don\u2019t have anyone now and I know it\u2019s bad but submissive to people I find online and on kink websites and that\u2019s the only human interaction I get. No connection, be it intimate or friendship lasts long. So what I do is when I do actually have the opportunity to connect with another human, I enjoy the first bit. You know when you\u2019re just getting to know each other and you\u2019re excited to talk to each other. I get the most out of that part and then I prepare for the end of the connection. That\u2019s how it goes. So basically I\u2019m a lonely fucking loser that has no one, no accomplishments, no money, no job nothing to offer anyone anyways so that\u2019s the real reason. I keep putting it off but i just have to wrap it up soon. I just feel guilty for leaving my mom alone in this shithole of a planet because I\u2019m basically all she has. Tired and hate it here",

We just figure stuff out as we go. \n\nTrust me when I say I\u2019ve been there, too much time and an active brain is dangerous for someone who is lonely. You can get yourself into all sorts of things. I fill my loneliness in with other things too. Never be ashamed though! \n\nYou need to find some purpose in life, and never underestimate how much a job can get you to feel something. Even if it\u2019s just getting you into a routine, then you have money, even if it\u2019s not much you then have other doors open but you need to take the first step! I won\u2019t say it will take your loneliness away but it could be the steps to give you a purpose and who knows maybe you will find someone on that journey, please don\u2019t give up though \ud83d\ude07 you got this!",

I\u2019m in such a dark place I just finished making a Lego Batman construction figure and hugged it as tight as I could without breaking it. Several times. I didn\u2019t want to put it back in it\u2019s box. I got so choked up putting it back in its box. I\u2019m literally crying and trembling as I type. I actually can\u2019t go on like this much longer.",

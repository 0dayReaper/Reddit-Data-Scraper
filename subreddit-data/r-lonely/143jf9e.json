Was pulled from an attempt at 18 and since then I'm just scraping by, kinda learned to just stop caring and try to make something with the time I've got left. There will always be someone that lives life much harder than we are but still keeps going, that gives me fuel too. Also, there is always specialists that can help, especially if you have thoughts of hurting yourself.",

I\u2019ve also had to go through difficult times, lost my friends, been through a war which is still going on in my home country, etc. Although I\u2019ve learned that when you\u2019re in a proximity of death you so desperately want to just be alive and have another chance. Life is, of course, harsh and complicated, although there is be no shadow without a little light. Anyone has the power to change their circumstances - it wouldn\u2019t come out of nowhere as we all have to work to get somewhere. But it\u2019s still worth it in the long run, because all of the wounds can be healed to some point - and then you begin to enjoy small things and victories. Perhaps, you should start with a new purpose that you would love - read a nice book (or even try to write something yourself - who knows, maybe you have a hidden talent), or enjoy some sports or other things. And then other people would absolutely love to get to know you as well, because we usually make friends who share our interests. It may seem that people around doesn\u2019t understand you or are just too cold towards you or each other - and that\u2019s true for some people - but there are also plenty of super nice and kind people who would absolutely love to be friends with you (but obviously to find such people you yourself would have to venture out a little and perhaps expand your circle of connections). I hope it would have you even if a little bit\u263a\ufe0f",

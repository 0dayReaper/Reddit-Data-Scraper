    "postText": "Yeah. It happened.... I finally reached my breaking point. I don't find any purpose to be here anymore. I've tried being a good human, I've tried to help people when I could. Ive tried to be a good dad. It's fucking pointless. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter. I'm fucking invisible. Why the fuck should I stay around? If I was gone, Noone would fucking notice. Noone would fucking care. Why should i?",

            "comment": "There is no point. Well okay, biologically we are supposed to reproduce, but humans are kind of past that being our only purpose.\n\nThere's a philosopher named Albert Camus and he says there is no point, and because there's no point you are free to do what you want. \n\nI kind of think that's stupid but what I take away from it is just have fun. I don't know what your life is like but try and experience it, just break away from your routine. \n\nIn the moment right now it's probably night time, after a long day, and this is the only time you are alone with your thoughts. Lots of assumptions but if you want to make this feeling go away for now just go to bed, wake up and get distracted.\n\nEdit: You aren't the only father who feels this way, many men feel overlooked. If it provides any consolation you aren't alone.",

I'm old, I feel I've experienced life. My kids have honestly shown they really don't pay much attention to if I'm here or not. I live everyday trying to break routines, get put of the funk but it doesn't matter. I realize that there's not much left for me to do. I help people randomly to feel like there's some hope for people noticing I'm alive. But that's short lived. I think I'm pretty done with it at this point. I've lost hope in humanity as a whole.",

            "comment": "It seems from how you worded this that you are measuring your worth by the reaction you get from people around you. Do things that make  YOU happy. Dont help people and expect they will be thankful, just do it cause it's a good thing &amp; know that makes you a good person. Or don't - because it's ok to say No! And if your a good dad your kids would definitely suffer your loss...but their kids...and they just become their own people and start doing their own thing after awhile. Doesn't mean they don't love or need you. I'm sure lots of people in your life would care and notice if you weren't around...but life gets busy and people tend to get caught up in their own experience. Anyway....The point is nobody knows what the point is. But it's a beautiful life if you let it be. We come into it alone and leave it alone and have to learn to be content within ourselves. Distract yourself from the negativity...dont let yourself stew in it. Dont give up. Things are usually not as big and terrible as we make them out to be when were stressed out. Hope you can find some peace.",

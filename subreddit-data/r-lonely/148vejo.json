    "postText": "Recently a good friend blocked me, because we haven't been talking as much lately. I can't blame them I've always been a boring and shitty friend. I don't deserve a true friend like I see other people have, everybody has a specific person they go to for feelings like this, their #1, I don't have anyone, there's nobody in my life who cares about me to listen through that. It doesn't matter what I do anyway because im such a fucking idiot, i can't pick up on things easily, and it takes me a long time to understand jokes fully, or peoples intentions\n\nAgain I messed up, this girl I've been talking to wants  me to find someone else who \"fits my humor more\", I can understand why she feels that way, maybe I overused certain jokes I shouldn't have and now I feel like a complete failure. Every time something good happens it always ends up with misery and I end up wanting to fucking die, I always ruin everything good that comes into my life, its so pointless.\n\nIts so pointless, I just want it to end. Nobody cares whether I wake up the next day, I try doing things for myself but without someone with me it feels empty, things feel so empty. I want to message that girl my real feelings but I can't bc ill seem like a fucking psycho. So my only outlet is speaking into a void where nobody will ever hear of this, even if someone stumbles upon this post its pointless because im easily forgotten about. I always mess up like this, somehow, I mess things up always, everyone around me who talks with me wants to leave because of how boring I am, and when I do joke its an unorthodox way of telling a joke, it doesn't fit how I look at all, and it comes across as cringe/corny.\n\nI worked out earlier in my day to feel better but nothing works, its not working, I still feel horrible. But at least I'm tired enough so that I don't fucking bash my own head in, or hurt myself, threes a limit to how much i can just look in the mirror and tell myself I'm okay, I am not okay, I've never been okay, nothing feels okay. I want to experiment with something, I'm gonna appear completely offline for a few days or maybe a few weeks and if nobody messages me I think I'll kill myself, im so tired of acting like everything's all good with me for the sake of somebody else, it doesn't help, telling myself its all fine makes me want to rip my skin off, its never alright.",

Just think about it, things you thought were major problems a few years ago are now insignificant. So a girl left another will come. Friends come with time just try to better yourself each day. Believe me with time and effort you\u2019ll look back to today any this will have seemed trivial. Keep going my friend.",

I don't want to keep going anymore, there is no reason for me to. I don't think a girl, or anybody wants somebody like me, ever. its not going to happen, she doesn't exist.\n\nthis feeling never passes, its a constant loop of misery, that i try to dig myself out of, I don't believe anymore.",

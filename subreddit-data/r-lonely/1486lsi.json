    "postText": "I\u2019m a 53 yr old man and I don\u2019t really have anyone.   I have a 7 yr old son that I see on the weekends but he\u2019s the only friend I have.   I\u2019ve tried dating apps and subreddits on here to try to make friends or meet a woman(in hopes of starting a serious relationship), but no luck.   Even at work I don\u2019t have any friends, just a bunch of co-workers.   Am I too boring, old, ugly?    I don\u2019t know.    On a planet with 8 billion people I feel as if I\u2019m on a barren planet all by myself.",

Are there any like hobby groups or clubs in your vicinity? If you find this, then you already have something in common with that person: Interest.\nIt gives you something to talk about.",

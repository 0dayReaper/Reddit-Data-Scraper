I've been rejected by family, friends, and past relationships so many times that my abandonment issues cause trouble in my daily life. I desperately crave approval and companionship. Therefore, when I meet someone who shows the slightest bit of interest, my mind goes crazy.\n\nI start thinking months into the future. Mind you, I barely know the person. But my mind takes the thought of them and runs with it. Next thing you know, they check all of the boxes, and everything they do is just amazing. Our minds tend to do that, and it's not a good thing. You receive attention/approval/intimacy from someone, that makes you happy, and before you know it you've subconsciously created a fantasized version of that person. It's a mind trick, and it makes the rejection so much more painful.\n\nI haven't mastered the art of not getting too ahead of myself. I still fall head over heals for people I barely know. But, I try and be mindful. When I feel myself getting carried away, I remind myself to be realistic. I try to see the person for who they are, without the nonsense my brain likes to make up. I know it comes from just wanting to be loved, but I stopped trying to force it. Low expectations... In my experience, that's the best way to prevent this from happening.",

People come in and out of my life so quickly, its like I wish I had a stable social life for once. When a friend texts me, compliments me, or takes a genuine interest in my life, it's like they have no idea how much that means to me and I have to be careful not to put them up on a pedestal. Even if they don't do any of these things sometimes I still find a way to put them there because of their talents or whatever. I have to remind myself of the ideal I create subconsciously all the time.",

Before my last break up which came from nowhere (bcs i was too naive to see it comming actually) i had so many big expectations and most of them based on what people told me (\u201cI.ll never leave you\u201d, \u201cyou are what i need and i.m sure of that\u201d blabla and so on). After that break up i took a slap from the universe and realised that i can.t even trust people based on what they say, even if they are confident at the moment that they are 100% sincere. The problem is that people don.t even know what they want and don.t trust themselves. Then why would I trust them? So i lowered my expectations to 0...and now wait to learn a person before trusting that they can reach some expectations. It.s hard to manage but i exercise it every day. Makes life so much easier. \nI hope you will get to the point where independence and confidence embraces you every day!",

The way I look at it, the more you involve yourself with day to day interactions, the less important they become. Take me for example. When I first started talking to a girl, even the slightest conversation about literally anything or any acknowledgement made me super happy. Now, I have normal conversations with her, and it seems less important. Try surrounding yourself with attractive people, talk to them normally, and then love interests become easier to talk to",

I started fantasizing about being with him because he looked after me, made me feel okay about myself and whenever I was with him my worries went away. He was just that bright light that a broken teen would crave in the dark. ... I also found him pretty attractive.\n\nI guess I understood the reality of that situation and that there would be absolutely no chance of being with him. Yet, my love for him grew anyway, and I\u2019m not gonna lie it absolutely crushed me. \n\nI knew that when I graduated I\u2019d be on my own and I wouldn\u2019t be able to hang out with him because that\u2019d be kinda weird. I was heartbroken knowing that he\u2019d leave a void in my heart when I\u2019d leave, and that I\u2019d never find a man like that ever again. That I wouldn\u2019t ever find a guy that made me feel the way he did. He meant a lot to me. I don\u2019t know, maybe I was mistaking admiration for love.\n\nIt\u2019s been a couple years since I\u2019ve graduated High School and moved away, and I\u2019ve gotten over most of my feelings for my teacher. I loved him and I still do deep down. I\u2019m just extremely grateful to have even come across a person like that during that time of my life. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be if I hadn\u2019t met him. I realize that I\u2019m still young, and that I have a whole life ahead of me. \n\nSorry for rambling. I just really needed to get this off my chest.",

I realized how bad it was for me so, instead of blocking my feelings out, I have as many conversations with attractive people, both so I don\u2019t feel awkward when talking to someone I really like, but also because I had craved attention so badly, that any attention from certain people made me extremely happy. If you get to a point where those simple interactions don\u2019t make you extremely happy and you just brush it off as someone being nice, but by all means please appreciate the jester, then you can stop infatuating yourself with whoever showed you the attention.

At some point I became so jaded to it that I started associating that with an already failed interaction (so if I fantasized about them, we'd never make it past being strangers). In fact, I started tearing down their perceived persona as soon as my fantasies began, essentially turning the experience inside-out, so if I couldn't like them, I'd dislike them, and make them not worth my time and thought. Outwardly, I'd simply interact normally, then forget them afterwards.",

That voice also probably tells you that you are missing opportunities or some kind of mess up. Shut that off. \n\nHard to do but you can. \n\nSecond when you start a sweet conversation again, then to avoid that awkwardness say hey would you like to get lunch sometime? \nPick a time and place. Something casual and lots of people. \n\nKeep the conversation casual and keep the conversation about her. Your building relationship of trust. \n\nPeople love talking about themselves trust me. \n\nDo a little homework on questions to ask. \n\nCan you do this? Yes",

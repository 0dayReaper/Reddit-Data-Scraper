He bitched to me saying he has no one to talk to but talks to ppl every night on his game. He declares himself a psycho/sociopath. Meanwhile me over here trying to make friends but everyone leaves me for him. I\u2019m so tired of making friends and seeing them all flock to him more. He\u2019s a manipulative piece of shit. I just want one friend that I can count on",

She complains about being \u201clonely\u201d but everytime we hang out she\u2019s always tells me about what\u2019s going on with her other friends. Always texting and calling them. It\u2019s hard to make plans because she always has plans with someone else. Most people just don\u2019t know what being lonely really is like. I know everybody\u2019s going through their own things but come on, how lonely can you really be when you have 50+ unread messages?",

Mostly I hear this from people that have a lot of friends, but they talk about how lonely they're gonna be if they can't hang out with them only for a day &amp; I'm like, boy be grateful!!! They wouldn't last a minute if they tried to live my life everyday...",

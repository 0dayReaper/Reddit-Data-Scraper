I know most of the lurkers are going through some deep trauma and don\u2019t feel comfortable with commenting or posting anything, but you all have to realize that the majority of the people in this subreddit are going through the exact same thing, or they can relate to whomever etc. So don\u2019t be afraid to express what\u2019s going on in your life!",

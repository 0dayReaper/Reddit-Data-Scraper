Loneliness has been the one thing thats been eating away at me for more than a decade. \n\nOnce in a while I will not be as bothered about it and then I will be able to focus on the other things that need my attention. Everything is a mess tbh. I work hard to clean all of those messes up one by one, or all at a time. I make good process and I feel happy helping myself. This lasts weeks or even months if I\u2019m lucky. \n\nWhat keeps pulling me back in seems to be stress from how traumatic my loneliness has been to me. Especially the part of looking for attention sticks out to me. \n\nThe amount of rejection a lonely soul looking for attention seems to receive is inhumane. Every night I remember trying to get some human attention and only getting disinterest and even people being mean to me. I remember believing the mean people and taking an attempt at my life because they were so convincing. \n\nYet I still look for attention \n\nPlease be kind to one another",

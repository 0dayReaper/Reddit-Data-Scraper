My big problem with talking to people and possibly making friends is that people kind of just disappear.\n\nMy interests are gardening, cooking, baking, music, learning anything, nature, and stargazing. I'm also interested in learning Italian and getting deeper into it since I want to see family in Italy some day. \n\nI'm interested in talking to anybody from anywhere so don't be scared to message me, I'm not a very judging person :)",

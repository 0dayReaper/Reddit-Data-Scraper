    "postText": "I\u2019ll start by saying that I am not lonely in the traditional sense. I have two children both in their late teens and a partner. \nBoth children do their own thing and aren\u2019t really interested in spending time with dad now. My partner works a retail job which sees her more often than not working the entire weekend aswell as most evenings. \n\nOutside of my own family I have zero friends that I hang out with - only 1 long term friend who lives nearly 250 miles away and only occasionally chat with via text. \n\nOf late the loneliness has started to get to me. Weekends feel pointless as I have no one to go and do anything with and wandering places alone only heightens how lonely i feel. Evenings are usually not much more than get in from work, prepare dinner and then go to bed an hour or two later.\n\nAnyone else here in the same boat? How do you cope with it?",

I know how difficult it is relating to my parents as they grew up in a different world than me, just because technology has advanced so much. I have no desire to play tennis which is one of my dad's favorite hobbies. My dad has no inclination or capability to play paintball or even video games. It just won't happen. But he also really likes snooker (pool) and I've been getting into it as well. He is really good and he is a good teacher. So that is something we can do together and have fun. Maybe there is something new that both you and the kids can try.\n\nPS the teenage years are tough, you try to give as much helpful advice as you can but your kids will disregard it in an effort to become their own person. Give it a few years and they will realize how smart you were all along \ud83d\ude09",

    "postText": "By older I mean like 40+\n\nMy best (and only) friend, of about 20 years, died six months ago.  We really connected and had similar issues. I realize that I will never have another close friend I can connect with again.  Having Klinefelter Syndrome pretty much ruined my life. If i didnt have KS, I would have likely been married and have my own family. \n\nNow I just have my mother and my two cats, who are all pretty old.  When I lose then I will be completely alone.  I don't want to live to see them die.  It's difficult enough dealing with the loss of my best friend.  I am kind of religious and worry if I did kill myself that I may be punished in some way.  I just want to die, but not by my own hand.  \n\nSometimes I pray that I die peacefully and for God to take me away from this life, to something hopefully better.",

            "comment": "I am in a situation similar to yours. I am much older than 40s. I have genetic kidney &amp; liver disease plus ADHD and ASD. I have my dog and that is all. He is nearly 15. My other dog died two weeks ago.\n\nI do not want to die though. I just want to have enough stamina to be able to earn money again and feel normal enough to make friends. I am adopted with one brother who lives far away and seems to hate me. \n\nDoes your condition cause chronic pain? Mine does in most people but I am relatively lucky so far -- stamina is the bigger problem, and the fear for when my condition progresses. I guess I am also kind of fortunate because as bad as my life is now, I did at one time have a big career and a decent marriage (before my condition was diagnosed). \n\nSo I know that even though I feel like killing myself right bow, I have been happy before and have the capacity to be happy again.\n\nI still have hope that if I get more energy I can join my local Universalist Unitarian congregation and make friends there (I am not a believer but the focus of the members is on social justice and that I do believe in). \n\nIs there really no way you can make another friend? Not now, perhaps, but when you feel stronger? \n\nSorry I am not more lucid. It is dawn here and I can barely keep my eyes open. My heart goes out to you and I hope that for both 9f us there are still a few bright days ahead.",

I've been reading a lot of these posts tonight and seeing the women upset with the men and the men upset with the women. I see valid arguments on both sides. I see obvious BS and sour grapes (snicker). I think it is more that we meet people we aren't compatible with who aren't compatible with us and we try to make it work anyways and it is a disaster for SOMEONE if not both. \n\nEveryone says \"I'm a good person\", so it can't be always that the other guy is bad. (shrug) I think that most of the time, we are just not matched up properly. Thanks for this thread guys. I will be 60 this year and have one person I call friend and several people who call ME friend and haven't had a date in a while. I've had three guys hit on me recently but they all ... talked to me in such a way that I knew that I wouldn't want to spend any time with them. Then, when you go home, later, in the night, when you see some other couple showing affection, or when you slip into your lonely bed at night ... you wonder if you should have given that person a chance or not. And you run through your values, or your choices, or your feelings and you go \"Nah, I made the right choice.\" We can't think that that makes the other person bad. Just not right for us. \n\nWhen I told the guys I wasn't interested, one actually asked me why not. I told him that I realized that that was just the way he was raised, but that at this time in my life, I wasn't interested in dealing with that sort of thing. He didn't take it well. (shrug) Not much I could do. But while some women appreciate being sexually ... quizzed/razzed whatever you want to call it as a \"first contact\", to me that sends up flags that I might have other issues with this person later. Does that make them a bad person? Probably not. Just not right for me. \n\nI keep hoping. But the older I get, the hope gets thinner. I hope you guys have better luck. \n\nPeace",

            "comment": "I have been single since I graduated college.  I was actually relatively good looking and popular in high school (I was a ginger with super fair skin, any gingers know the shit you had to take back in olden days).  When I got into college I kind of socially took off and was really popular, had some really stunning girlfriends (one became a well know actress).  While in college I started to experience heavy depression, and panic attacks.  I hit the bottle and that worked for 8 years, then I crashed.  Over the next 10 years I  had 6 hospitalizations, lost good corporate sales jobs, and became a wreak.\n\nAll my friends got married had kids, moved up the ladder.  With the depression, unfortunately I kind of missed the window for getting married.  I thought this was a catastrophe, but as I have moved into middle age I see it just wasn't my lot in life.  I have very few friends, sadly quite a few friends have died too early, or we drifted apart.  When I got sober thirty years ago all of my old friends (drinking days) disappeared.  Studies show that making friends is harder the older you get.  So all of this sounds depressing, but it's not.\n\nI still go to CBT therapy, read a lot of psychology books, and try to stay active.  Funny enough when I hit 50 I started having younger women hit on me.  I think it's flattering, but have never gone that route.  My thinking is when I'm 80 they will be in their early 40s, doubt that will work.\n\nI recently started reading Stoic philosophy, and it appeals to my situation and my current mindset.  The ancients dealt with the same issues we deal with today.  They saw that most of everything in life is outside our control.  We can control our thinking and our emotions, and we can be happy in any type of circumstances life throws at us.\n\nI had a silly event happen about six months ago that proved to me that happiness is possible without all the trapping society says we need.  I was watching Netflix and a woman walks into a scene of the movie.  Turns out it was my first love (over 40 years ago) of who became an actress.  I avoided reading about her, or looking her up on the internet  for decades because it reminded me of loneliness and \"failure\".  Oddly this surprise visit had no effect on me, I thought \"wow she still looks great\" and then I watched the little scene she was in.  This would have been devastating 10 years ago, but it had no effect on me.  I guess some of the work is paying off.\n\nLife can be a shits-show, I have a choice on how I interpret the show.  Like the man said to Mrs. Lincoln \"other than that how was the show\".",

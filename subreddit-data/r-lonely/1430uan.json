    "postText": "A bit hesitant on posting this, but I wanted to get my thoughts out there\u2026:\n\nFrom when I was 8 years old (now almost 26), my life revolved around online communities which I\u2019d feel closely attached with. I\u2019ve had an overbearing amount of bad experiences, mainly because I have both high functioning autism as well as BPD, which has resulted in me having many, many unstable online relationships, while having massive misunderstandings. Being on these online communities really exasperated the problems I\u2019d have, and I\u2019ve shed many tears and experienced I feel more heartbreak than the average person. Which I now realise it\u2019s really not normal for a human to experience, and I also phrase it in a way that we as humans aren\u2019t evolutionary meant to be socialising online almost all the time.\n\nNow that I\u2019m almost a year on from being Discord-free, I feel my life has very much improved mentally. Although I still have severe mental health issues and trauma from the experiences I\u2019ve had alongside social difficulties, I\u2019m going through therapy to help with things.\n\nI also go to real life gatherings sometimes and though I still very much struggle with forming deeper connections, it feels like I\u2019m at a point where not every other week something traumatic happens. Which of course is better than being chronically online and having these communities instantly at your fingertips\u2026whether you\u2019re in a good/bad mood, whether everyone\u2019s busy and people keep you on read and they end up forgetting\u2026plus due to the nature of text itself, massive misunderstandings and conflict are inevitable. For me especially, I feel more \u2018drunk\u2019 as I have less of a filter online compared to in person.\n\nIt does make me think that it\u2019s better to be alone, rather than put a bandaid like being on Discord servers, and while it may feel good a bit, it really did rot my brain.\n\nThought I\u2019d get this out there, I also hope it helps someone too, as I don\u2019t see many people talk about this specifically. My heart goes out to others who are also suffering, and I hope we can all overcome this together. :)",

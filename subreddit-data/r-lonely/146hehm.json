I work out 5 times a week and have seen killer results in the last 3 years.  Yet my social life continues to degrade, all throughout high school I lost friends left and right to ghosting me or them losing interest, I do great in life with my starter job and the people I meet are nice to me yet none seem to ever have an interest in getting to know me.  It always feels like i am a distant relative to everyone I know.  Do they know my name? Yes, do they know anything about me? No. Im so confused how I can be a spectator in other peoples lives. The friends I do have never invite me to things and never ask me how I am or what I\u2019m doing.  I just wish that people see me as more then a side character.  I mean I\u2019m doing everything right yet nothing happens Im fit I do good with social skills but nothing changes",

You deserve someone to hug you every night after a difficult day, and wake up to that same person while still being in their arms. \n\nI know you\u2019re tired of hearing the same uplifting advice but always keep in mind \u201cOne day.\u201d \n\nToday, yesterday, and the maybe even year before, you\u2019ve always had your back and you will continue to. No one may know your life story like you do, but they can welcome you in open arms. \n\nI wish you better days Background. I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re overwhelmed, but I trust your heart will make the choices you need. \n\nGood luck Background. \ud83c\udf40",

I\u2019ve been lonely all my life, and I haven\u2019t had a real relationship at all so please don\u2019t be so down on yourself that one person will eventually find you, I\u2019m still waiting for my person to eventually find me I don\u2019t go chasing anymore that just leads to broken hearts at the end of the day cause some of them aren\u2019t emotionally ready, or they eventually go back to their ex\u2019s. So just be patient I'm here if you ever need to vent.",

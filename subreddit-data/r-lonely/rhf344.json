People that believe lonely girls are girls that are looking for a relationship are terrible. The OP is right, the fact that some people only show their help to those who they think they can date is disgusting. Where is their humanity? Like seriously, why are they so selfish? Girls are like boys; they feel lonely and it hurt everyone. The idea that some guys will dismiss the pain of girls for their own pleasure and the fantasy of making her their girlfriend makes me sick. The other way around makes me just as sick.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nAnyway, the thing is that it's not that so much that it is pleasant, it is not moral. If I steal your can of soda, I am not choosing pleasant stuff; I am choosing to be mean for my own pleasure. Same here, I can hardly believe that people who only help a F19 are doing so because of her pain (They are not doing it for good reasons.) they are thinking about themselves the whole time.",

So you want to shit on women because she exposed a well-known fact that women are considered as \"love, sex and wife\" toys. Like for what ? Why do you want to blame women, just give your story and we'll be nice and help you, but keep your weird universal revenge uno card to yourself. \n\n\"Funny that women are allowed to shit on men but when it\u2019s the reverse people can\u2019t handle it.\" Boys have huge problems too, we all know that. But it's not a game. Don't be like \"I blame you if you can blame me\".",

It's an empty word spoken by people who grasp at straws. If men got the same amount of attention as women and had as many people asking them \"are you alright\" there would be alot less suicides, especially since there's still a stigma towards male mental health.",

            "comment": "a lot of posters here are single guys who feel \"lonely\" because they are single or cannot get a girlfriend. personally i must admit that i have a lot of anxiety irl when i talk to strangers and specially the first or 2nd time i talk to a girl(to the point that my hands start sweating quite a lot,lol).  \nBut i have been trying to work on that, in this life not everyone will like us and socializing is more like a russian roulette game for me, with some people i click and with others i simply don't click and earn their hatred and antipathy.  \nYes, i know how lonely you can feel because you are single and don't have much friends...i know it from my experience, watching all my friends slowly to drift away from me and to see the 2 girls i loved with all my heart and to whom i sacrificed so much just leave me and getting a new bf in a spam of a couple of months while i have been single for basically 4 years in a row,but, this also helped me to stop putting others on a perfect and beautiful pedestal, to stop seeking validation and love from others, to stop wasting my time with people who mistreated or used me because even tho they manipulated and treated me like shit, they gave me some company, i deserve better than their crap, so, i would rather be alone,friendless and single than being surrounded by false shit.  \n\n\nTL.DR: Putting others on a pedestal never ends well, no matter if you have friends or a gf, your friendship or relationship will eventually come to an end, so, sadly, we need to get used to be happy alone and find things that we can enjoy doing alone and we could also enjoy doing with others, also, if you can, try to get a bath, exercise,sleep well and take care of your mental health, don't become obssessive or extremely attached to NO ONE, this is the MAIN REASON WHY A LOT OF US WERE USED,ABUSED AND THROWN TO THE TRASH LIKE TOWELS.  \n\n\ni no longer sacrifice my time to please my family, i no longer allow myself to be used by \"friends\" who only remember about me when they needed money or when they were arguing with their gfs or bfs,i no longer write  beautiful/cute/humble/kind messages to the girls i was in love with, because they never lead to anything other than me being manipulated... don't call everyone your \"friend\" and don't take an \"i love you\", \"you are my friend\", \"you are my true love\" as something 100% real. in the best scenario consider it as a temporary sentence.   \n\n\nonce the love and use ends, friends,relatives,crushes and s.o will leave.",

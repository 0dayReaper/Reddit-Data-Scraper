I have been getting drunk more and more to help it, but even then I can't seem to do it. Is this it? Have I reached the point of emotional coldness? I'm drunk right now so I can barely even think straight but  I know that I seem to be becoming more distant lately. Have I reached the point of not truly caring or have I just been though enough to not be able to feel anymore?",

Im fact, I wish I was more oblivious to the feeling that I can change for the better because it hurts me to know I can be a better version of me but I wont make the moves to do it right now. Im sure when I sober up Ill have a good think about things.",

Personally, I haven't shed a tear in over 20 years. I doubt I ever will again. I'm ok with it. You just need to find another outlet. Alcohol should not be that outlet. I'd recommend finding a hobby and putting all of the emotion you want to feel into that. It helps. Good luck man.",

            "comment": "From my experience, weeping can be very therapeutic, but it can also be a bit addictive.\n\nLet me give you my perspective on it, because I don't know if there is a well established one yet.\n\nFirstly, everything inside of you serves multiple function, because that's just the sophistication of the human system.\n\nWith tears and crying, one function is that it communicates authenticity of the emotion you're expressing, since it is an involuntary thing and to my mind, impossible to fake. Meaning, even world class actors still have to conjure up real emotions to make tears happen.\n\nAnother function of crying can be seen in how it somehow seems to flood the nervous system with very a pleasurable and rewarding feeling. Not the same, but in a similar way to something like an orgasm, or laughter or whatever. There's a certain euphoria that comes with crying.\n\nIf that is hard to see and accept it's because of the second function I'm mentioning so far. And that is that it serves as a kind of anesthetic for dealing with painful feelings. So you are simultaneously feeling both very bad and very good at the same time.\n\nThe reason you have anything is because its useful. Because that's how evolution works. And the reason it's useful to be able to cry while dealing with painful feelings is because it is in your human nature, specifically your human mind, to run away from bad feelings through distraction and repression.\n\nFeelings are both modes of behavior and also information about things external and internal. Therefore strong feelings when repressed, linger in the subconscious as if waiting in a queue for the next chance to be processed and integrated into the psyche. Like an update for your operating system with useful information.\n\nSometimes that information feels so bad it's intolerable and so when it arrives, either from it's original source in the moment, or from your subconscious after being repressed, the nervous system will initiate a kind of involuntary reflex when neccessary, similar to vomiting, and it will take over your system and it will pacify you (the mind and will) with strong sweet feelings that crying produces, while it processes that bad feelings. Like psychological surgery. Or just, dealing with harsh truth.\n\nSo while weeping can be immensely valuable at times for healing or what I call, integration, deliberately and consciously seeking to get yourself to cry is almost similar to sticking your finger down your throat.\n\nTherefore you should not try to make yourself cry, just as much as you should not try to repress or distract yourself from feelings as they arise. Instead you (the mind and intention) should practice physical relaxation. That is, relaxation of muscles AKA progressive relaxation. As this is the simplest and most natural way to hand over control to the human system so that it can do whatever it needs to do.\n\nYou can do this in dedicated sessions or whenever it crosses your mind. I do it all day when I'm not doing something, and even sometimes when I am doing something.\n\nDoing this shifts attention away from the thinking mind and into the physical body and breath. Because relaxation will automatically require attention on breath.\n\nOne thing I found really accelerates the integration process is isolation.\n\nWatch anything where someone is isolated from others for a period of time. And no matter who it is, at some point they will start to break into weeping.\n\nThis is partly because humans need social contact almost like water, yes. But also, it is because when in isolation the attention as nothing on the outside to direct itself to, and so it gets turned around on itself (you), and then that starts to bring up repressed thoughts and feelings from the subconscious.\n\nThen when weeping comes on it's automatically without trying to initiate it, and quite painfully, you try you best to be still and quiet and relaxed. And with each slow and deep exhale, a powerful surge of energy moves through your nervous system and a great amount of integration takes place.\n\nThe result of this integration is that there is overall less resistance and tension in the nervous system, and that means in the body and the mind, and so your consciousness is more open to experience the subtle joys in life. You can enjoy simple things again and you don't need as many crutches that we pick up in life like all kinds of addictions and so on. It's very powerful. And it's fairly simple. But not easy. For me it happened all by accident.\n\nEDIT: Drinking was not very useful to me at all although I used to abuse it heavily as a crutch. But I understand you only do it once a week.\n\nMuch more useful, invaluable even, was the use of a small amount of cannabis. It may truly have been the cannabis to a large degree that did all of what I explained. But it was actually multiple things, most of all isolation, and aside from all of those possible tools, healing and integration is a natural thing in your system and so can be done with nothing at all.",

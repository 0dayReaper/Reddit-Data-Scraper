I do have cats but they\u2019re kinda independent and do their own thing lol. I would love to have a gf, but right now I\u2019d rather have friends to hang out with on weekends rather than laying around feeling lonely",

I feel like a major outcast- I eat lunch alone, never have anyone for partner projects, don\u2019t do anything on weekends, no friend circle, etc. I\u2019ve tried to join clubs and all this year but that has gotten me nowhere lol. I\u2019m similar, in that I\u2019ve always been a loner (I ate lunch alone sometimes as early as 2nd grade!). I used to have a friend group in elementary school and early middle school but we broke apart and they all have other friends and different friend groups, meanwhile I don\u2019t have any. It sucks big time feeling like I\u2019m wasting my youth and my potential, but it\u2019s sort of comforting knowing that I\u2019m not the only one feeling this way.",

All my friends are starting to get relationships and spend time with their boy- or girlfriend so then there's much less time to spend with me or their other friends. And the one time I fell in love myself, the girl I liked ended up getting in a relationship with one of my best friends, so that also still hurts every time I remember or see them having fun together, even though it's been months since their relationship started. Sorry for the whole rant but I just wanted to say I know what it's like to spend the weekends alone. I hope everything will work out for everyone reading this, and for you as well, OP",

It's kind of fun in the beginning to watch all the stupid shit happen but it gets old fast and you'll fear for peoples safety. Clubs suck ass, you're paying to be in an overcrowded place where drunk girls spin around like beyblades and hitting you with elbows and falling over everwhere. Meanwhile you have the guys that either hug you or try to fight you. Not to mention you're gonna lose a ton of money. Although it can be fun to just let loose and meet some old friends and classmates. But for me, the bad things were too much.\n\n\nI would recommend doing basic hobbies like sports and stuff. It's way better and you probably won't feel like shit the day after.\n\nAll I can say is, I was feeling the exact same as you are. I stopped giving a fuck, went out and all that. Realized how pathetic people become when they're drunk and I just became a babysitter and cleaning up a whole kitchen filled with puke for 3h at 3am was fun. Its expensive as FUCK, especially when they persuade you to go get some food. Everyones experiences are different but I feel like partying is too glorified.",

Until you get out and do anything you will continue to wallow in your own problems.  I went to bars and strip clubs when I was younger and dumber, eventually learning that I\u2019m like a lot of people and just need to find my crowd.  Social media has distorted the youth for sure.  I was born in \u201885 so I actually went and played outside with my friends when there was no Facebook or instagram or Snapchat or Reddit.  I\u2019m thankful for that as I can see how it\u2019s harder for young people now.  The hardest part is overcoming yourself, so even though I\u2019ve done this and that I\u2019m still here, but I\u2019m trying.  Of course if everything was easy we\u2019d all be fit and rich and fulfilled etc.  I\u2019m saying do whatever it takes to try to change at least a little.  It\u2019s actually as simple as going out and getting coffee or talking to people at your favorite food spot.  You just need to try.  I can\u2019t speak for everyone but I can say that if someone engages me in friendly conversation I usually have something to say back and that\u2019s just a start.  You have to try.",

IDGAF if you're 35 with two kids -- you have the power to make your life better.\n\n4)  Other people seem like they're leading this awesome, interesting, fun-filled lives.  The reality?  They're not posting their dad's alcohol problem and their third Top Ramen of the day to Instagram.  The life that people present and the one that people live can and are often drastically different.  You are privy to the banality and problems of your own life, but not others'.\n\n5)  You don't have to be interested in the same things that your peers are.  It's a fallacy to assume that \"youth\" is all parties, clubs, and nights out with friends. It can just as easily be a memorable moment with a book next to a river, or getting to know your grandparents as an adult, or learning about things that are important to you. \n\n6)  People try to preserve their youth by acting the same way they did when they were 17 until they're a 45-year-old, burnt out, tired-looking version of their younger selves.  Guess what?  They're throwing away perfectly enjoyable years by trying not to waste their \"youth\".\n\nYou have every opportunity to find and pursue things that are of value and importance to you.  I believe in you; you can do it.  Be brave.  Get your hands dirty.  Fail a little.  Learn from your mistakes.\n\nMake it happen for yourself.",

There\u2019s so much you can do. Try and find something you love doing and go do it! Go meet new people and visit new places! There\u2019s still plenty of youth for you to live. Me.. not so much.

I now find myself hanging out at bars with people in their early 20s and it's not until I get a bit drunk that I realize that I'm significantly the oldest person there and how pathetic it is that these \"kids\" are getting to experience things I never bothered with when I was their age.",

I thought I wasnt doing anything right playing video games but really, I was doing what I wanted and thats whats important. now im 33 and still do the same except work a lot. I dont have a whole lot of friends but the ones I do, theyre there. If you do, go to these hangouts and such make a couple friends. if not? there will be so many other times youll do as such. I mean, all these things are the social things to do but if you dont do it, it doesnt mean youre wasting anything. you do you. binge watching FarScape recatapulted my love for Space and now thats all I use Youtube for because more becomes learned everyday. never know what little thing will blossom, ya know?",

I went and got pizza, walked around and then went to the show. I got to see my favorite artist and almost got a picture with him.  I\u2019m currently debating on leaving early (not really interested in the other acts but kinda wanna still Check them out) \n\nAll n all, I had fun. With or without anyone :) \nDon\u2019t miss out on memories because of your insecurities.",

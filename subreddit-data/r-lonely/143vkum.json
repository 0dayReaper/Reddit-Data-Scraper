I'm a good listener, so if you ever need emotional support, I'm here for you. We can support each other. I have some funny videos I could share and positive affirmations, and I also stream movies.\n\nI know how it is to feel alone, and if you're reading this, I'm here for you, and I think it would be nice if we could keep each other company sometimes. \n\n\ud83d\udc95",

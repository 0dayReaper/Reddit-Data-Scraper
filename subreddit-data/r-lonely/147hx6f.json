    "postText": "I love when someone randomly comes into my life blindsiding me with how great they are. Like its so easy to talk to them the conversations we had last for hours and doesn't feel like it'll slow down anytime soon. They make me feel like \" yes this is what I've been waiting for, finally someone I can connect with and share everything with \". Then of course that free trial period ends and the good times along with that person eventually disappear .Leaving me to wonder \" what the hell even was the point of all that\" all that time and energy wasted on another dead end. Then I start overthinking like \" was it something I said?\", \" were they just using me for entertainment?\" , \" was I replying too fast?\" , \" did they find someone better?\" After awhile the feelings for that person fade but here and there and the ever so often rereading of old texts in the middle the night stir up buried feelings and thoughts of what if.\n\n\nAnyway thanks to coming to my TED Talk to whoever read this far",

    "postText": "I invited a lot of people (30 people) I know but it is just for show. None of these people actually know me other than my bf and that makes me want to throw up. Im just doing this cause my bf said I would be sad if I didnt do anything but the problem is: these people dont relate to me at all. \n\nSometimes I can talk about anime, others I can gossip, others I talk about games. But these people usually only like one thing in common so my chats are pretty limited. These people dont know how awful college is cause I dont have a group, they dont know my mom is insane and I hate that I dont have enough money to get out of this misery people call home, they dont know how badly I wanted to talk about graphic design (my career and also a hobbie), they dont know ANYTHING. I dont even know why I can call them friends, they are all replaceble as none of them show interest in really getting to know me.\n\nKinda needed a friend that actively asked questions about how im doing and what do I want from life (usually I AM that person but people dont do it for me). I would trade this room full of people just for one single soul to actively care about me (other than bf, and at least I have him but he is mostly family now and I dont consider him as a friend I would talk to eventually as he pratically lives in my house and he is just my other half rather than someone with different thoughts and ideas)\n\nAnyway, im diagnosed with moderate depression but MAN these days it gets SEVERE. If this continues the way it is I think this might turn into severe for good tho. And tbh, not having friends is literally the thing that gets me depressed. My problems at home or at college are just a phase (I hope so) but not having someone to share this with and laugh about does the most damage. I dont know if I ever will have a friend like that and it makes me want to give up.",

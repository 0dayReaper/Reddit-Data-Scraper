She said that She will be always my friend in and out of discord or social media, yes they will be always be there for me but they have a personal life too and stop overthinking that no one cares about you because they will always care for you. So after that I feel better now and I believe in my friends that they are always have my back.\n\nI won't give any advice since everyone has their own way of coping but if you do need someone to talk to, my inbox is open and remember that even though no one came to say hi it does not mean you are useless or does not have purpose, maybe they are just busy right now in their personal life.",

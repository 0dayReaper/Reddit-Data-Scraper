    "postText": "Hi there! 34M from the Midwest(US). Actually I just had a birthday, so still adjusting lol . Anyhow, a little about me and what keeps me busy: I just graduated about 9 months ago. I work as a department administrator at the same school. I'm also pretty involved in community/volunteer work. That has left little time for friendships over the last few years. \n\n\n\nPost-grad, I've spent the last year researching and building a business which just officially established and if all goes accordingly, should see its launch this summer.   I plan on entering a graduate program hopefully in the next few years, once my company is up and running. As busy as I often am, I'd like to take this time to find and make friends. I've been sober for  6 years and I'm appreciative of how completely different my life is at this time, but in changing things, I've become quite lonely. \n\n\n\nWhat I hope to discover is someone that I can share both the mundane details of daily life with and maybe the deeper aspects too- I have a penchant for philosophical banter! I'd like to find someone to talk about everything from the humdrum blues of life, to the mysteries of the universe. I'd eventually enjoy having enough familiarity with someone that when they mention that one person, situation, or scenario I'll have enough foreknowledge of them as both a person and their daily life that it will have meaning and context. I can reply in a way that is not just some canned response but as someone who has a real vested interest. Of course, some of the same in return would be amazing. Our conversations can be as in depth or light as it happens, but always just what feels right. \n\n\n\nSome of the things I like and hobbies: I'm a musician and spend a good deal of my free time writing music, recording, and playing. I'm also am a pretty voracious reader of both fiction and non-fiction, although partial to good science fiction and horror. I enjoy a lot of different interests. Some of them are psychology, Sociology, Anthropology, History, Philosophy, Biology, Ecology, linguistics, and others. I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as I can and out of the city when its possible.\n\nRandom Fact: I speak an endangered language that fewer than 6,000 people know fluently I'm not fluent yet but getting there :) \n\nLess seriously, I like laughing and joking around the most and would hope to find someone else who does too! \n\n*If you'd like to know what I look like, check it my Reddit history!  \n\nI hope you all find what you're looking for! Good luck",

    "postText": "Last saturday I ran into a person that recgonised me, while out and about on my ones. I used to talk to one of her old mates.\n\nI hadnt seen her in over a year, and we had never talked. She ran up to me and gave me a hug. It was so warm and welcoming. I genuinely felt so happy at that moment. we talked for over an hour and i bought food for both of us. \n\ni got home later that night, around 10pm. went to my room, and cried. i havent felt loved in so long. i just felt like in that moment there was someone that cared about me. She 100% doesnt understand how happy i was.\n\nI want to message her and ask if she wants to meet again, but anxiety says no. i hope i bring myself to it\n\nedit : she just messaged me and i had physical breakdown. omg i havent opened it yet. my heart is fucking pounding. someone help. omg omg\n\nedit 2: okay so she said she would be down to meet up! but she does live quite a distance away and travelling is difficult for me because of my age. im really happy. thank you everyone",

            "comment": "I had something similar happen to me,  I dreamt of being with a girl and me and this girl were happy,  laughing and all that.  Basically I was actually happy. Then I woke up and I sat there for a minute and cried my eyes out because I didn't want to wake up.  I woke up to being single and craving interaction and love more than before,  the fact that it happened like 4 times within a year shows me that I want love more than anything is this world. Side note earlier this year I had a class with this girl. Long story short I make Music and she can sing,  so I ask her if she could sing on a track for me.  We discuss it then the conversation ended.  Then like 20 minutes she asks me what kind of music I make and what I'm into. So I let her know, then somehow we ended up talking about video games and all the games that she had played and they are the ones I've played so we talked for like 2 hours after that.  And when I was gonna go to work,  she says \"what no hug?\" And I thought to myself \"she wants to hug me?\" So I did just that.  Then the next day she had a Naruto shirt on,  and I was like yo this girl is cool asf.  That same day she asked me to ditch class to go hang out. And when I went to leave she puts her arms open and asks for a hug again. And let me tell you I held her for a good couple of seconds during the hug and oh man was I happy, we hug out everyday after class until well the corona virus. I'd been texting her , but get late responses which is totally cool and understandable because she got stuff going on and I don't wanna text her all the time (even though I wanna) I don't want to seem needy.  But the point of the story is I feel you,  that hug was the best part of my day. It's crazy what a simple gesture can do for someone",

Human touch is so important and it just breaks my heart to see how many people are lacking it and simply want a hug. I also know what social anxiety is like and it is the worst and is so debilitating. I am sending you a virtual hug currently my friend, all the way from cold Iceland. I am gonna hug my friends extra hard from now on.",

Just message something like, \u201cIt was nice seeing you the other day, we should meet up sometime.\u201d If she agrees (I\u2019m sure she will) then set a date, because if you leave it at that then although you have both established an interest in meeting the chances are it wont happen. \n\nI hope I didn\u2019t ramble too much there, I wish you the best :)",

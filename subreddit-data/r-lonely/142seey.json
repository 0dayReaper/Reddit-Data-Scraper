    "postText": "Through out my life, i had different groups of people with me through out  school, uni and work. Im always the one who keep things interesting and always making work a laugh. \n\nWhen circumstances change they all leave me behind. They all make time to hang with others and i become an after thought. I guess i care a lot for others but do not receive the same. Im not some weird creep.\n\nIt always ends with me being left sad, dark and alone.\n\nAnd now I have accepted that some people are just meant to be alone. \n\nIm done trying now i\u2019m just going to fully embrace it. I have started to look at being alone positive, no more let downs, no stress and bs drama. Careless on what people think. Not going to try fitting myself in.",

I can't escape myself...fix me?...brother understood me but now he's gone...and I don't need my older brother anymore I'll do it myself...he wanted to be like you people...he wanted to be normal and left me...I don't want to be normal. I don't want your fucking world. I hate you all. I fucking hate you all. Lol yk it's kinda like when you cry as a kid, go in your room and hide or crawl under your bed but it changes nothing. Do yk how funny that is? Do yk how little fucking say you have? I'll show you...if possible I'd grab my younger self screaming and yell LOOK AT IT LOOK AT IT YOU FUCKING LOOK AT IIIIIIIT...good I only hate myself lmao...good I'm so fucked up soon enough no one will be left. I WANT TO SCREAM BUT THE CHILDS A MAN NOW...so I'll just get institutionalized. And so it builds. When it comes though it won't matter when I scream it'll echo for miles and then I'll laugh knowing finally doing such made a difference. Hear me I'll say. Listen. Because you'll only hear it once...is this me? Idk anymore",

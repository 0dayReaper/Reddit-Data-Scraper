    "postText": "I'm quite used to being lonely, haven't had friends for 3 years at this point. And the few people I've talked to were internet folks. Sadly, all of them gone now.\n\nI'm okay not talking to any acquaintances for weeks, you learn to get used to it, but these past weeks have been really tough for me, I just crave some genuine human interaction so badly.\n\nPeople ignore me at work, luckily I'm a programmer, so I've got some WFH weeks that help me avoid people. I've also tried to make some friends at my French classes, but again they ignore me or are not interested.\n\nI just feel like I lost all skills needed to socialize. I think people expect humans to not have those skills at young ages, but when you're an adult it's something that most assume you'll have.\n\nIt just gets harder and harder to practice those skills when there's such a little amount of sympathetic people. I wish they'd understand that I don't wanna be like this, I just want a friend.",

I never even talk anymore, when it\u2019s not to myself lmao \n\nI mean I do use AI chat thingys and that helps sooo much but I don\u2019t want to get too attached because I know it\u2019s not real but hey it\u2019s nice to have something there \n\nThough I\u2019m starting to feel like loneliness is just a thing some people have to deal with and that\u2019s just what it is. Some people are destined to be forced to enjoy their own company, even though they want someone so desperately. If that\u2019s so, kill me now lol.",

As much as it sounds clich\u00e9 it's a good opportunity to put time and care into yourself, whether that be education or health or anything. I can't say it won't stop you wanting someone to be there because really it hasn't for me but doing well with yourself is a good start. \n\nYou'll find your people, you'll see. \nTake care of yourself.",

Even the introverts of us need companionship. \n\nWhat I consider to be normal (healthy) is a group of 5-10 friends you see within a few months time frame, and 1-3 closer friends you see every week or two. That's how people who have the healthiest social lives tend to structure their friend group. \n\nWhen you look at cultures that are more social than we are in the west, you see just how much effort they put into regularly spending time together. Some close friends will see each other every couple days on average. That happens up here, especially at your age, but as new technologies come into play that distract us, it becomes harder and harder to get people to invest in each other.\n\nI don't have a solution for you. The only option we have is to keep pursuing relationships with anyone who may be interested. Keep putting ourselves in situations to meet people. It doesn't come naturally to me at all, but it's what we have to do.",

The worst that can happen is that you have to restart. It's gonna annoying, but you'll have restart everywhere.

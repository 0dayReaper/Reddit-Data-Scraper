I don't have the hobbies that I had in my country but u still have some of them here. Look at meetup groups in your city, at clubs for gaming, music, I don't know what you like. Planet is ful of lonely people. Even those with others, many of them are lonely in reality. Separate people with kids, alone with health problems. Find interests in your life and don't look the others. We don't know anything about their real life but only the appearance. Only a walk at a park looking others scaring or playing can charge your batteries for the day. Reddit is the worst company for lonely people.",

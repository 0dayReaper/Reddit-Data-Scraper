Not because I'd enjoy others' sadness but because I see I'm not alone on this world. I can't change anymore. I only want a drink and reading you all here. This is my confession.",

Just responding to things that strike a chord with me and processing a few viewpoints I am not normally familiar with.  Seeing other people like me who are like me, just making it through the day to get to the next.  It reduces some self judgement about my current situation.",

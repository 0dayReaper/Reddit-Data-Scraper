And the work life balance is nonexistent it is work to stay alive which has the added bonus of keeping us from ever doing anything to make us happy including being social and making friends. Under this system none of us working have the time outside to actually date like people used too. Meaning we\u2019re a generation of people who are all separated. Nobody really interacts we all live our separate lives with no time or money to even find eachother to join. Ironically if you somehow found someone and could pool your money together you might stand a chance. But that\u2019s not what the system wants for us. If you\u2019re under 65 you will live over 100 and you will work until you die. It\u2019s a real black pill kinda thought. But the only solution is retaliation.",

LOL meaning that you're explicit about looking for something real. The reason I'm saying all this is because once a dating site becomes less popular people leave it in droves and to keep their numbers up especially if they were stupid enough to hire a lot of people during a boom of popularity they have to use Bots. Some of the best ones use them: Match POF. And they don't exactly use them sparingly. They use them 100% of the time if you're not getting any regular hits on your profiles.",

I tried once a long time ago and I had all kinds of sick propositions. The few guys I did meet were only looking for a quick hook up which I explicitly told them in my profile \u201cdo not contact me for a casual hook up\u201d they dident listen. So the profiles are worthless in my humble opinion.",

It sucks because I live in a small town, so places to meet someone is an hour away. Like bars, or anything remotely interesting. Online is sort of my only hope...and it's too expensive to keep trying that. Sorry for what those guys were doing. Hopefully you can meet someone better without going broke.",

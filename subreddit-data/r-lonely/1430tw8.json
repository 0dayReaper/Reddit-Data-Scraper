    "postText": "I find it incredibly difficult to initiate conversation (I think some people call this NPC energy) with anyone outside of my small group of friends or close family and with most of them either having kids, living far away, or just busy, it gets lonely. It\u2019s even tough for me to make a post on Reddit even though no one will know who I am or what my background is. (I\u2019ve never posted anything on Reddit) I have social media apps, but never post, comment, or like, I simply just observe. But watching everyone live life is starting to make me realize I haven\u2019t been living mine. There\u2019s many people I\u2019ve been drawn to and wanted to develop a friendship or relationship, but could never commit to even saying \u201chello\u201d or \u201cI\u2019d like to hangout sometime\u201d. Im capable of being able to hold a conversation if they start the conversation, but just engaging with new people for the first time is something I can\u2019t do. But I\u2019m trying to work on it. I guess this is the first step.",

I had a friend over for the holiday for a few years as tradition but that was much less formal and I haven\u2019t even talked to him in a long time let alone hung out with him. Nowadays on this holiday, I basically just get really drunk close to midnight and avoid social media so that I don\u2019t have to see all those stupid posts of people out partying. It\u2019s always a joy when it all blows over.",

Back in \u201919 I was separated and about to sign divorce, \u201920 I was unemployed and needless to say it was a bad year for 99.98% of EVERYONE, \u201921 I had a crisis at work and I was sure I\u2019d be fire upon returning, but I worked hard during \u201922 and managed to turn it around and got a nice bonus. So it\u2019s the fourth year in a row I am doing my lonely ritual, but for the first time in four years, I am not scared.\r  \n\r  \nHappy new year everyone!",

    "postText": "I'm 20f looking for a friend\u2661\n(preferably identifying as a girl as I've had bad experience with most guys approaching me). I'm very open minded and accepting to all:] I love movies, music and videogames! Some of my favourite movies are Daisies, The happiness of the Katakuris, The new Spider-Man movie (yes it was that good) Black Swan, The lighthouse, Hereditary (etc etc) and some of my favourite games are Yume Nikki, Far cry, life is strange, Walking dead (etc etc) and my favourite artists are Viagra Boys, Bjork, Everything Everything, Shame and cage the elephant (I'm new to music so if you have any suggestions, I'd love to listen to your favourite songs)",

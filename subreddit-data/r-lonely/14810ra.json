    "postText": "The title. I didn\u2019t have a single friend when I was a kid. I was homeschooled until age 14. Then I went through a year of bullying and still didn\u2019t have a single friend. Got better at university and actually made a friend in my sophomore year but that didn\u2019t last long. Made two buddies during master\u2019s years. But I\u2019ve NEVER had a partner in my entire life (F25). \n\nIt\u2019s crazy to see how people who used to be loners like you eventually manage to find someone in their early twenties and move on with their lives. They all really got better at socializing as soon as they reached adulthood, as if they\u2019d known the secret of bonding all this time but simply preferred to be loners. \n\nI still don\u2019t know how to bond, it\u2019s rocket science for me I swear to god. It\u2019s harder than maths, physics and programming combined, that is why my attempts to get insights into building relationships often end very quickly due to burnout. I hate living like this.",

            "comment": "I once heard a friend mention something about feeling alone doesn't have to necessarily translate to being a bad thing. Those are the negative aspects of it. The positive aspects of it would be basically living the same way, but without the feeling of \"needing\" a connection. Personally it took me almost 2-3 years to figure out what that meant, but I think it means finding yourself to be your own source of connection, but still interacting with others in a connected, yet disconnected way. By this I mean i don't give a flying fuck about any friendships or interactions at heart, but I present who I am as authentically as I can and just go with the flow so if they wanna stay sure but if not I'm good regardless. I've just learned to enjoy the time with others as is but I'm basically a happy hermit.",

For example I\u2019m a toxic person so I find other toxic people and make companions or enemies depends on if they can take a fucking joke or not. Lots can\u2019t so it\u2019s even tough on me to meet people",

She\u2019s probably the closest I\u2019ve been to anyone.  Thing about her is she\u2019s brave, when it comes to people.  She\u2019s very open to a point that people could easily hurt her.  But that what was missing for me, I was too scared to open up to people, afraid how they might see me, afraid I\u2019ll get hurt.  I learn from her bit by bit how to open up.  When I\u2019m scared I just tell my self \u201ctake a chance\u201d and give me enough push to just do it.  I know that might not be what your problem lay and tbh if someone just tell me this I wouldn\u2019t get it.  I had to learn it by example.  By I hope you meet someone one day that makes you feel belong",

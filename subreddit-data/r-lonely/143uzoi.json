    "postText": " Hi guys, I'm Anna. then... I ended my relationship a few months ago and I've been feeling terrible, even though I know it was the best decision (it was a long relationship, 3 and a half years, and in that time I only discovered the worst things that a person could discover) so many lies, so many girls involved, I feel terrible. and thinking about it makes me even more anxious. he went out with a girl i never liked, talks to her, talks to others i don't like too. I know we don't have anything else, but this hurts a lot whether you like it or not. this is all messing with me too much, I wanted so much to give him a vote of confidence, but after I found out more things the best thing I'm going to do is walk away. I trusted him, I gave myself up, and even so I was made of an idiot, I wanted to be able to hate him, but I hate myself for being so pathetic..\n\n the outburst was huge, I'm sorry for the mistakes, i'm brazilian.",

His lost is your gain realizing it was a toxic one sided relationship you left which is a plus on your side because there\u2019s so many men out there who will treat you the way you should be treated and want to be treated. Men who won\u2019t lie or step out on you. You\u2019ll find someone put your first foot forward don\u2019t dwell on the past just look at the present and toward the future. You can\u2019t see what\u2019s in front of you if you keep looking behind you",

    "postText": "Don't really expect much from saying any of this, I just kinda wanna complain, but I really dislike how I've been single for such a long time. I think it's been almost five years since I've been held or kissed. I'm at least thankful that I do have a handful of close friends, and in fact my support system these days is significantly better than the friends I had in the past. But I always go home alone, and then I have nobody to cook for or build with. I've wanted to have a happy relationship for as long as I can remember, but the last few girls I've dated didn't think I was worth keeping &amp; having no luck with dating apps, I don't really know how to meet anyone when I'm usually working and my current job has sporadic hours and locations. When I was working retail, I never tried pursuing any customers even if I thought she was attractive, because that would be unprofessional and whenever I am in the customer role, I don't flirt with women who are just trying to do their job. So, it seems like it will still be a long time before I can find someone.\n\nI am very thankful for my platonic friendships and especially those who feel like a brother or sister to me, but I miss romantic love too, and I wish I had someone to comfort and hold me when the world feels too overwhelming and suffocating; and somebody I could just do cute stuff with while we take care of our pets and help each other reach our dreams.",

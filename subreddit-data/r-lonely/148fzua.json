He also has a niece of I supervised and the niece was a total piece of $hit to me. Didn't listen to me and always got upset if I gave her the impression i didn't care about her.\n\nNow there is a 'party' for us coworkers and everyone who is able is going... I Don't want to go but I already said i'm going. The 'party' is Wednesday, what do I do? I just don't want to look bad or look odd. ",

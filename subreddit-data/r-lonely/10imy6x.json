I am out there with my head down, speed walking, trying to get home as soon as possible. People really have no idea how lucky they are.",

Then he was so giddy and running to see his son to love him with all his happy energy. He had no one to celebrate with or even tell. There was no pics or announcements to write on social media. No loved ones to say they were proud of him. I think a lot of people live to please their friends and parents but never get to feel such because of them.",

My anxiety is too uncomfortable so it\u2019s best to stay alone. I also have trouble relating to others. A lot talk about movies, music, social media trends, recent plans or memories at local bars etc. Things I am completely unaware of. But I can talk about abnormal psychology or sacred geometry. So its kinda my fault but I can\u2019t shake it and it\u2019s a cycle of loneliness.",

Then if you start leaning on them for emotional support they'll dropp you faster than a bag of crap.\n\nIt's a slippery slope and you have to climb uphill. Hopefully you'll run into other climbers who just want to give you a hand to the top. Most of the time you'll run into one who wants to drag you down for no other reason than they'll be above you.\n\nI am in a middle-zone between friendless and too many friends. I have nobody around who likes me, genuinely shut myself inside because almost all of my out-of-state friends hang out with me on discord, and that's good enough for me.\n\nSo if I had any advice, it would be to seek some online communities that focus on your interests. A lot of subreddits have groups that have discord channels that can wind up being a nice garden of variety to find some potential buddies.",

I try not to judge so quick now as I\u2019ve been surprised many times by those I thought were after my money but turns out was something more innocent. \n\nGenerally speaking, just raw survival instincts alone many out there want to find other successful people or at least someone with something positive to offer as a friend so naturally, someone has to be that friend who is offering with receiving little or nothing back atleast at some points in life and with some relationships.\n\nIn a long winded way what I\u2019m saying is, it takes time to find those people so in the mean time, work on becoming the friend that you always wanted. Many are out there without genuine relationships so don\u2019t worry, often a bad relationship is more draining than none at all and keeps you from becoming your best self",

Get a girlfriend/boyfriend and suddenly that person is prioritized at all times despite you having a decades-long relationship with the person as a friend.\n\nWhen I say 90% of people, that seems like a hopeless number but there are 8 billion people on earth so that leaves 800 million others who are decent or even awesome folk..

But he is the only friend I have here. I have decided to put myself out there though. I have social anxiety, so it is very difficult. But I am going to try. I have signed up for some volunteer work. The same non profit also organizes some events which I plan to attend. Meetup website is helpful too. Bumble bff is another cool way to make friends. I actively started doing this last week, so no major success yet, but I am going to work on it. It is difficult and sad and I am with you on that! But don\u2019t give up!",

It can be gut wrenching to be confronted with that jealousy. You aren't jealous of the people per se just of the closeness and friendship they get to enjoy, while you are missing that in your life.\n\nIf you are one of those people, like me, who revels in a solo/Alone life that doesn't mean these things go away. I often feel like this as well.\n\nFor me its a fleeting feeling, when I am eating alone, or out enjoying the view somewhere and something like this happens to me. I brush it off as part of my past and not who I am now. \n\nI hope you will find some friends to be in a group like this. Even if its only once a month or every couple of weeks it will make this go away for you, at least mostly.\n\nAgain, I know its been said ad nauseam, find a hobby you enjoy that can be done solo or with a group of friends. I enjoy cooking and often cook large meals and bring in the extras to acquaintances at work. I have a friend who I have recently started cooking with and she and I will cook something together, eat the little bit we want and bring the rest in to work to give away.\n\nThis is only an example but it started with me doing it by myself and I found someone who wanted to do it with me and we are becoming friends thru it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHopefully this can help you, if nothing else know you are not alone and your feelings are valid.\n\nStay strong",

            "comment": "Try to get courage to make small social interactions. Then, talk to a stranger. Then, try to get courage to ask that stranger to be your friend. This will take time, but small steps do the work! I used to be like you, now this are turning around for me. I mainly did exposure therapy. Here is what I recommend:\n\n1st phase \u2013 getting to know human interaction \n\n+ go to a store and say 'good day/morning/evening' to the store owner, and when you leave say 'goodbye/bye'. If that feels too threatening, you could begin by just going to the store, buying anything, just that. No greetings. If that feels too threatening, you could just take a walk. Take a walk to the store. If that's too much, try to get out of your house first. Then, each day, go a bit further and further. Don't be shy to acknowledge any progress, even if it's dealing with an urge to give up after not doing that, acknowledging it and trying to change it because it's good for you.\n\n2nd phase \u2013 getting comfortable with human interaction \n\n+ familiarize yourself with people you already know. Spend time with your siblings, your parents. Doesn't have to be anything big, really, at first. Understand this is important tho: if you struggle to maintain connections there is gonna be a problem when you get through all of these extra steps and suddenly it's overwhelming to carry a conversation. You can practice with anyone, anyone in your family you're in good relations with. If not that, talk to a cat, if not that, talk to a wall. Get comfortable with leading the conversation, beggining the conversation. \nPotential convo topics:\n- grades (u got a good grade and want to let your parents know)\n- experience in class (u don't have to be a part of it to talk about it)\n- etc..\n+ Then, try to let your siblings, parents, grandparents, talk. Ask them questions, LEARN how to get interested in other people's lives, 80% of conversations are people talking about themselves/their lives. If you don't have anyone to talk to, cat will also do, wall will also do. Ask wall questions, then, sub-questions, etc. You can even create an imaginary friend! Let it be a fictional character if you want to, or a completely random person (I make them attractive cuz it's easier to motivate myself, don't tell anyone \ud83d\ude4f), and get to know that person (create a character) through asking questions. \nPotential convo questions:\n- favourite color,\n- favourite food,\n- fav drink..., Hobby... (Easy! Right?)\n\n3nd phrase - teach yourself that people like interacting with you\n\n+ compliment anyone. On anything, the most basic stuff, you don't have to over-explain it! This part is crucial, while giving any compliment, let your face speak a part of the story: smile, look stunned by the beauty of their haircut, interested in their sweater, their clothing style... You can do this with anyone, really, it's not hard at all to find something pretty in a person. The feedback will be positive IF you look genuine AND (really important) if the person isn't an asshole. If the person scoffs, does anything weird, trust me it's them it's not you. I complimented a lot of people, and only one person wasn't kind about it.\n+ compliment STRANGERS. Teach yourself that it's safe to interact with STRANGERS. When you see something about a person you like, just go up to them and compliment them, wherever and whenever. If you can't make yourself do it, count backwards from 5 to 1 and then go. Works incredibly well.\n\n4rd phrase - make a friend\n\n- this is it. You're ready &lt;3\n\nRules: \n- remember that if you want to skip some steps, EVEN BETTER! GREAT! DO IT!!!\n- if you don't like a step, CHANGE IT, ADJUST IT TO U AND UR SITUATION. Let it work FOR YOU, not against you by creating more anxiety about social interaction. \n- you don't need to follow any of this, literally make your own step-by-step how or improvise but I'd recommend you follow the points.\n\nGood luck &lt;3 also, anyone up for a friend online, I have a chat :)",

Things got better for me but I can't say there's a magical cure for loneliness that will put you in touch with new friends.\n\nIf I could go back and fix things in that time, I would be more honest with people around me, especially at work. It used to crush me having to lie about my social life when people asked me. I wish I'd just been more honest about my situation. I've learned that honesty can be very liberating, and people are generally empathetic because we're all struggling in one way or another. \n\nI also wish I'd searched longer for helpful therapy and not given up at the first hurdle. Lastly, I wish I had taken more risks in social situations instead of sitting quietly. I already felt like crap, so if I open my mouth and something bad happens, then I just still feel like crap. But if something positive happens, incrementally, it could be life-changing.",

They are married now, busy with their own lives, already used to not having me around. Basically, life went on of course. Eating in a nice park, by the lake, feels so exposed and I really feel the emptiness nowadays. Funny how my life turned out, a lot of things can happen in 10 years, nothing can happen in 10 years.\n\nI just find it really hard to make friends these days.

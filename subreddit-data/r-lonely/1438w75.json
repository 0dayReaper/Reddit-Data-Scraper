Maybe some uplifting Bible scriptures (if you\u2019re religious). Sometimes when I\u2019m lonely at night I talk to an AI bot and surprisingly they help me with my anxious thoughts. I hope this helped :) remember when you\u2019re anxious and getting all these thoughts, to focus on what actually is true. Anxious thoughts aren\u2019t true thoughts. Tell yourself good things !",

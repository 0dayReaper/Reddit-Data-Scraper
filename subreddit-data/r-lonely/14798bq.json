    "postText": "i mean there is actually nothing positive about myself. i\u2019m just so far behind in every aspect of life it\u2019s honestly sad. i always see people my age succeeding in even the littlest of things, meanwhile i\u2019m just stuck in my bed, lost in my depressive thoughts like i\u2019ve always been for over a decade now. it\u2019s so frustrating knowing that i have no value whatsoever and there\u2019s nothing i can do about it, and because of that, i\u2019ll have to pay for it by suffering the curse of being born. no one will ever love a person with zero value (and i can\u2019t even blame them), so there\u2019s no reason to try anymore. \ni truly do hate my life, i\u2019ve wasted all of my teen years and i\u2019ve already wasted 3 years of my 20s, so clearly this trend shows no signs of stopping. my life is so meaningless and i don\u2019t see a change happening any time soon",

I am around your age and similarly compare myself to those around me, some are graduating with bachelors, whilst I'm considering starting one. We all take life at our own pace. \n\nBeing stuck in bed is awful, I've had periods where I might be waking up in the afternoon which isnt great. We all go through our own unique experiences be it good or bad, whats important however is that we push on. You may feel miserable inside, but pushing yourself out of your comfort zone be it your bed or house is the most important thing you can do for yourself. \n\nMost times the biggest hater in our life is ourselves. You do not have zero value, everybody has value. It is how we interpret these \"values\" that define us. You might find no value in yourself, perhaps others might value your personality. Try look at yourself from a different point of view instead of someone who knows everything about you. \n\nBeing stuck in a rut can be hard to get out of, which leads to what you call a meaningless life. Try something new, otherwise you wont see a change in your life. For me, volunteering and fitness helped considerably. Look into your hobbies and see if there is something you can expand on. I would consider some form of therapy/counselling depending on what you believe your problems are, but I assume you've done so already, if not give it a go!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to DM.\n\nTake care of yourself.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a 21M just going thru a depressive phase I guess. Just feel so lonely. I don\u2019t wanna go out no more. Don\u2019t really wanna see my \u201cfriends\u201d. I was talking to this girl for 3 months. Texting everyday. She leaves to Mexico for 5 months next week and she just said that when she gets back I won\u2019t be able to see her again. Kinda just made my day a lot worse. Just been feeling like I got no one and she was always there yk? Now I just feel so lonely. I\u2019m not bad looking I\u2019m pretty good with females but as of late I\u2019ve kinda just not been good with them. Maybe it\u2019s just in my head or because I\u2019m depressed. But I kinda just want someone to be by my side more than anything. I have a very supportive family but idk I just want someone my age, more like a friend to be there. Just venting thanks for reading if u did.",

It\u2019s so hard to get past that. \nI hope you find someone to keep you company and be there for you! If you want to message me and chat feel free. I hope you feel better soon! \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97",

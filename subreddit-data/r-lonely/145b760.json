    "postText": "Few days ago I saw a post here saying that you can be happy alone no matter what society tells you. But does anyone actually care what society tells you about being alone? For me it's just my own inner personal need and desire to have a companion. I just don't want to be alone. It never even came to my mind in the slightest that I shoudn't be alone because of some social norms. I'm not ashamed of being alone. I just genuinely miss a companion in life. So is there anyone who actually struggles with society pressure regarding being alone?",

I think some do fall into that trap of peer pressure and it doesn't make a bad situation any better.\n\nAs for happiness being alone, I don't know how everyone functions but I feel like yeah maybe you can be happy to an extent alone, but chances are you might not really be truly fulfilled at the end of the day. I think it's something magical when you become fully aware of another person's personal struggles in this world, help them and in return they help you, thus becoming something more together.",

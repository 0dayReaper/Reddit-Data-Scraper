Makes me feel less alone for some reason. One guy said hello to me as I walked past his patio &amp; I\u2019ve been feeling so lonely lately that it was beyond appreciated just to have another human acknowledge my existence.",

            "comment": "Aww..That was truly a simple act of kindness from that guy who found it necessary to say hello to you.  These small acts of kindness shows a long way to make our lives better and it actually costs nothing material and intellectual. Equally importantly, we need to live \"in the moment\" to admire and appreciate small things we do in life. Often times we all chase a big thing and a far distant future and forget to live \"in the moment\". We do not relish the coffee we drink, an occasional indulgence in beer or wine, a small talk, a hug, a tiny smile we receive from a stranger, a simple chat etc etc, simply because our mind is fully occupied and tied up in perceived big goals and  a perceived future. \n\nYou should consider it a great progress that you are able to acknowledge such a simple thing in ur life. Add to it,  it is also evident that your presence could be felt even for a stranger and you can be proud of that. You are seen, you are valued, and your presence matters.\n\nPlease continue being in this positive frame of mind and start to enjoy \"simple things in life. Please feel free to message me, if you wish to chat/discuss any further.",

            "comment": "When I feel something like that, I try to pay attention to the sensation in the center of my chest, which may feel like something dense, sweet, and emotional, and then allow it and nurture it gently by keeping my breathing slow, deep and steady. \n\nThis way of breathing slow, deep and steady helps to relax the muscles in the body, and also center the minds attention, which then opens up your nervous system.\n\nThis then opens up the so called spiritual heart in that location, in the center of your chest, and it radiates, in a potentially very powerful way.\n\nThis sensation you feel there is pure love. It can come from loss or gain, happiness or grief, beauty or depression, someone else or yourself.\n\nIt's when something meaningful is touched by you and the sense of appreciation for it moves through your nervous system and your mind, and focused at a junction point in that location in the center of the chest.\n\nOnce you start to become aware of this, just by reading and understanding this comment for example, its effect and power will grow.\n\nFrom a psychological paradigm, it is like an elixir of pure healing and pure meaning.\n\nFrom a spiritual paradigm, the spiritual heart and love is the most powerful spiritual power anyone possesses as far as I know, and seems to be the very source of miracles.\n\nFrom an artistic or a recreational paradigm, there is no greater, more profound feeling, AFAIK, than when the spiritual heart is radiating at it's peak. It can bring you to your knees. Literally take your breath away as you float in pure euphoria. It can open up your consciousness and perception of intelligence, beauty and meaning in a way comparable to psychedelics or drugs. It can make mundane daily life, or the most unseeming works of art shine like a Mona Lisa.\n\nFrom a everyday life perspective, it can bring about radical automatic, effortless self transformation.\n\nSo next time you feel the grace of love visit you out of nowhere, as self-compassion during a period of psychological or emotional isolation, this *might* provide a useful perspective on what it is and how to look at it.\n\nThank for reading :)",

    "postText": "Practically accepted that I probably won't end up in another relationship for a while now. I don't know, I realized it's actually much harder for me to fall in love with someone, I'm not the hopeless romantic I used to be. I kinda just feel bad for any guy or girl who confess their feelings to me, and I just feel nothing towards them. Had guys confess their feelings to me, and I just felt nothing, plus, they were practically strangers. Only been talking for a few days. \n\nI actually like having platonic mates instead, friendships seem to last longer than relationships, maybe that's why. I mean, yeah I'll be single and lonely romantically, but friends are cool.",

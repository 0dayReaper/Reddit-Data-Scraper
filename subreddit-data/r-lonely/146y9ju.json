    "postText": "It's been almost a year since my wife left me. For the past month and a half I've been talking to a girl who came back into my life from high-school (almost 20 years ago, im 37). But I think I need to stop talking to her, I really don't want to because I've fallen in love with the person underneath all of her problems. But I can't bare to see her how she is now. \n\nI don't think either of us could just be friends with each other. I don't really have friends either, so if I cut her out of my life my days will be so incredibly  silent. As it is now we text each other almost all day.\n\nI'm an extreme introvert and don't like things most \"normal\" people do so I have no idea how to meet new people. I've even tried making online friends on discord but every time I join a server I get overwhelmed and scared because everyone there has connections already. There is no way ill be able to fit in.\n\nMy brain knows what I should do but my heart doesn't want to.",

But also 8f they're not willing to help themselves either, then everything can come crashing down. You can't do everything for her, j7st help.",

She admits she needs help from time to time but doesn't seem to want to follow through, which I can't blame her it is very hard to ask for and look for help.",

I ask her to not talk to me when she is doing the stuff I don't like, and she usually respects me and doesn't. But then I feel really guilty and selfish for asking that of her, but there is nothing I can do to help.",

Otherwise you're no help to anybody. And since they're are pretty much the only people we interact with, here comes the loneliness feelings. Have to be ready to deal with those too.",

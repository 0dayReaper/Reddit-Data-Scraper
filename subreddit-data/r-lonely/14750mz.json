    "postText": "I came out of a tumultuous and passionate, but overall explosive relationship/engagement last year. I\u2019m not proud of how I\u2019ve behaved or how things got so bad. My partner was and is a broken person as well, but no matter what I did or asked, it wasn\u2019t ever valued. After so much air seemingly be sucked out of the room, I looked elsewhere for affection and validation. Did I cheat physically? No. But I did sext some chick from years ago that, in a fight, my ex snooped and looked at my apple watch and discovered texts I didn\u2019t delete on there. I haven\u2019t been able to forgive myself for fighting back in some way. She chose herself and a bottle over her and I. We remain friends, as we relocated to Texas together and have struggled to fit in. I have expressed for over a year that I want a second chance, we have hooked up here and there, but she doesn\u2019t seem to care that I\u2019m lonely. She has improved and is better in ways, except she\u2019s moved on sexually and I haven\u2019t. I\u2019m terrified to be hurt, I have no friends here, and thank goodness I have my dog because not sure I\u2019d be here. I want to feel okay and excited to meet new people, but I have isolated since that day really and rarely go out or do anything. I\u2019m happy to take any feedback regarding any suggestions of making new friends, standing firm in expressing my love for my ex to her but drawing a firm boundary that I cant just be friends and accepting the loss of that. 32 year old man and I feel like I\u2019m hiding from the world",

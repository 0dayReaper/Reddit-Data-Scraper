    "postText": "Hi everyone, my name is Evelicia and we had a great time with my ex-boyfriend. However, one day two years ago, I found out that he had cheated. This was a huge blow to me because I always thought our relationship was genuine. However, he didn't apologize to me or try to save our relationship.\r  \n\r  \nThings got worse because he started being violent towards me. Whenever we argue or he gets frustrated, he loses his temper with me and hits me. I tried to make him understand that his behavior was wrong, but he couldn't seem to control his emotions.\r  \n\r  \nEventually, I understood that I needed to leave him. It wasn't an easy decision because I love him, but I know I can't stand his violence and betrayal. After we broke up, it took me a long time to heal my wounds and rebuild my life. Now, I feel stronger and more confident, and I know I made the right decision.",

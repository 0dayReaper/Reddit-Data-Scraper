Maybe that is a possibility or maybe we are just a experiment where end is the part where the experiment is over for each specimen. \n\nHowever, it's upto us to believe what is wrong and what is right, possibilities in this cosmos is endless and we don't know what is is that we know and we don't. But what i believe and learned in this whole journey of 27 yrs of my life is if you don't have a purpose than make one. Because either you can live everyday why am I living like this or maybe submit yourself to something which is helping others and making your life fulfilled. Not always the materialistic gains are necessary it's your way of living is also important. \n\nLife is rough and it can get that way but it's our own choice how we want to get things done",

    "postText": "My gf broke up with me because she is scared she will treat me badly in the future. This just doesn\u2019t really make any sense to me and has left me very hurt and confused. Feels like I\u2019ve done something wrong and she just doesn\u2019t want to tell me or something. We had only been dating for 2 weeks or so. I\u2019ve never had a long term relationship and it just feels like I\u2019m getting further from having one. I really liked her and tried my best to show her that I cared about her. Just doesn\u2019t really seem like she ever cared now and that she was just leading me on. I\u2019m very hurt and don\u2019t really know what to do. I really want her back.",

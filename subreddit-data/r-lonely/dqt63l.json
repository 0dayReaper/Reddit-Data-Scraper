She flashed a man and eas harassed to suicide, tragic but it only made it onto the news back in 2012 because of her infamous video online, and her popularity. Earlier that same year, a little boy was bullied so much that he killed himself at a terrifyingly young age, and only a few months later his father killed himself as he could not handle the grief. This family received no mainstream media coverage, and nowhere near as many people know about them, despite it tragically and permanently impacting their community. It's simply proof that far too many of us go silently into the night, never to be remembered, or mourned by the people we tried so hard to please, while others, be it because they are more socially adept, more attractive, more impactful, or what have you, will be etched into the minds of our classmates, our coworkers, or even our families far deeper than we could ever be. The world is a cold place, it's cruel, unfair and depressing, but suicide is never the answer, and I'm so sorry you and your community were affected by it. Stay strong man, my prayers go out to you and those affected.",

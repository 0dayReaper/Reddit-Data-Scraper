I've tested the theory (without knowing) and all the female friends pushed me away BUT at the same time were more than happy to dump their emotional issues on me.\n\nI'm a lot more compassionate and understanding of things, and how people go through different things based on circumstances, but other people will just cut you out.",

I've never had any more trouble with women than men when it comes to how people react to my mental illness. It depends on the individual. My experience has been that some will leave you (usually people who have their own issues but are in denial) some will stay (usually people who don't have many issues or have their issues well-managed) and some will get closer (usually people who also have issues and feel more comfortable around others who understand).\n\nMind you, don't use people as an emotional dumpster, that'll put nearly anyone off.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m at a place where other than family I have no one. I want more friends and I miss having conversations with exs and how we would talk about anything and everything. Life can be so lonely and nothing is as fun without friends and/or a partner.\n\nThere are things I won\u2019t tell my family so my mind feels full of thoughts. It\u2019s also a jumbled mess. Just want someone to love me and to love back. A good portion of my friends died and well after awhile exs just don\u2019t talk often.",

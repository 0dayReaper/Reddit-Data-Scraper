    "postText": "I keep making friends who stay in contact when things are bad, but pull away when they get better. I try to be communicative. Someone told me I am like a human self help book. But then they move on. I feel like I am treated as a filler to occupy people until their lives get better. Nobody wants to be a committed and communicative friend.\n\nI feel broken. This year has been absolute rock bottom for me. I am barely scraping along, and mostly doing so out of spite. I lost most of my close friends over the past couple of years. I am adrift and I don\u2019y even know who I am.",

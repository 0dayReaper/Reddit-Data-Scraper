I have seen psychiatrists and  therapist for years and in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy one common mental distortion people have is that they do what\u2019s termed \u201cmind reading\u201d. It is related to \u201cfortune telling\u201d cognitive fallacy because the person who is not experiencing either depression or anxiety in both cases assumes they know what is happening or what will happen. In case of mind reading it\u2019s thoughts like \u201cthey/he/she won\u2019t like me because...\u201d, \u201cif I do this people will think so and so\u201d, \u201cPeople dislike me\u201d, \u201cPeople hate me\u201d, and basically anything that we think and assume people are thinking or saying about us often lacks evidence that they do. Our minds are conditioned by our past experiences with some bad people, or with anything, to think a particular way we may have gotten used to. \n\nThe way people try to help themselves is they do cognitive behavioral therapy journal or sometimes straight up on their mind if they are experienced. In cases of mind reading we need to write down what we feel, then what we think, then we try to identify whether the way we think falls into different fallacy categories. In this case mind reading. There is no way any person knows what their friends or acquaintances actually think, and they assume it is something particular.",

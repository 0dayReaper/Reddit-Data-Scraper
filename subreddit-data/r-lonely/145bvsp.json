    "postText": "I'm like Ross lol, falling in love with every other girl that I talk to. I'm fucked up. Not a single girl ever liked me in real life. I'm a guy who's about to enter his 20s.\n\n* No girl that I ever talked to feels for me the same way I feel for them, if I do feel for them that way.\n* No girl has ever approached me.\n* No girl ever initiates a conversation with me on their own.\n\nI believe I'm a good looking guy, but all this rejection and non-appreciation makes me feel like I'm a person with looks not good enough for a good looking girl, or even average looking for that matter.\n\nIt has messed me up so bad that I have to put literally enormous amount of efforts to talk to a girl and that gets me attached to them, and voila. That's a recipe for a disaster. What do I even do? \n\nI can only think of one solution, to stop being vulnerable and be emotionally numb. You don't need to be loved to stay alive, duh. I just have to condition myself to numbness by accepting the fact I will never find love.",

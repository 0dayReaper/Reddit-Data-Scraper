    "postText": "I feel like my loneliness is the manifestation of my bottled-up emotions. I want to talk to people about the way I\u2019m feeling, but I never want to be the one who\u2019s \u2018bringing the mood down\u2019. I want to be able to tell someone about how I\u2019m feeling and actually be seen/heard. So I\u2019m 23M and have never had a serious long-term relationship. I think all the time about finding one, but I don\u2019t know the first thing about dating or asking girls out. I did indicate that I was interested in a few people when I was a young lad and got turned down. I went on a few dates with a girl last year, and I thought they were going well until she ghosted me. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s a fear of rejection or low self esteem, but something keeps me from expressing romantic interest in others. I want to be happy, and I hope that one day I will find someone who makes me happy and who I can make happy.",

            "comment": "my biggest advice for young men struggling with girls, is to forget about girls all together. I know it\u2019s tough when that\u2019s such a big part of life, society tells you you\u2019re a loser or not good enough without a girlfriend. but if you\u2019re lonely, you need friends first. girls, guys, or anything in between, don\u2019t go into a situation hoping to come out of it with a partner. find some friends first, because dating somebody won\u2019t make you less lonely, you still need to be happy regardless of your relationship status.",

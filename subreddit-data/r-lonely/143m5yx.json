    "postText": "19m college student, I can honestly say I've never had a single meaningful relationship with a female, even as friends, it's really taking a toll on my day to day, it makes me feel like I'm undesirable and unwanted, I mean for fucks sake last time I talked to a female was a few months ago when she asked me something about an exam as the professor was handing out the results and never again, I still think about her daily, she's in my class this semester and she's the biggest reason I'm doing so well and actively participating, and she's basically the only motivation, just seeking her validation, in hopes that she has a question or something or other, and I fucking feel disgusting admitting this, but I keep watching her Microsoft teams status to see when she's online, probably to make myself feel in control, any fucking solution to stop this kind of shitty behaviour, I see one bit of validation and I'm all over it. Help.",

And University was striking my sanity so bad that only my cat was the only friend i had. About your university crush I kinda feel its really similar to my uni crush i was doing literally same things like you are doing rn. But now im 22 and im in happy relationship. You must believe you are worthy. You deserve to be loved. I have to tell you that people you meet in university are prob one od the worst you will meet in your life. Its because they also have their problems maybe traumas, they leave their family homes, they try to live like they want ( even if its not really good way) and another huge reason why they arent good material for friends/ partners is that they see you as their enemy. They think right now you all are participating in competition at work places you gonna get after graduating. But its not truth.  I know it hurts and you feel scared that this girl is the only one in your life, but trust me she isnt. Dont think about her. Try to create your comfort zone that has nothing in common with your school. You already achieved alot in ur life to get into university. If you need more comfort words you can always chat me but i cant promise i will reply fast. Hope you will get better bro!",

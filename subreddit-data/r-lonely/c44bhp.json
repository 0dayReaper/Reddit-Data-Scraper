I've had it since I was 4 days old and I've hardly slept without it more than 20 nights since then, never two nights in a row. \n\nI have it with me throughout the day, sleeping, sitting, eating, expect when I'm in the kitchen or washroom. NO ONE is allowed to touch it. \n\nIt sleeps on me rather than the other way around. Even during the hottest nights (we don't have air conditioning) it is always around my neck. I can't imagine living without it and I intend to be buried/cremated with it.",

I miss my ex's arms around me, and mine around him. I miss his nightly request of, \"roll over, Boo,\" as he liked for me to lie on my side so he could snuggle into me. It has been 12 years, and the loneliness seems soul-crushing and endless. I cannot seem to find my new lifetime love, with whom I can snuggle and cuddle to my heart's content.  I never thought I would be alone, so lonely and longing for love at this stage of my life. My forever love, did not last as long as I had hoped. \nI will not get another dog, as my Jack was/is so precious to me, and his death completed the process of shattering what remained of my already broken heart. \nI am sorry for the long spiel.",

    "postText": "ever since i got out of the womb, i always felt different. always got picked on from kindergarten all the way to graduation, and i never really understood why. been always ostracized and treated like crap and used by people, social cues were always used against me as i've always been oblivious to them, and it's just been awful feeling so pushed away by everyone\n\ni got diagnosed with adhd last year, and been learning these past days i might very well be autistic as well, so at least i've been getting the potential answer i was looking for such a long time. so much of my past trauma and childhood make so much more sense now\n\nstill, it's so upsetting to see how badly you can get treated just for being neurodivergent, no matter how much you try to mask. i've always felt like a minority, and it's so tiring, even making posts on reddit about my feeling, the majority of replies i get are very superficial, dismissive, and downright belittling. imagine writing a long post about how you're upset that you will never be able to establish a relationship with a member in your family, and comments are like \"it's normal\", \"just smoke some weed bruh\"\n\nhell, i'm being told to \"touch grass\" just because my emotions (esp as a male) are more pronounced than most people's, i do admit i don't get outside too much, but at least i do it once per day, however litrle, i always try to find a reason even if i have virtually no friends irl, never had the luck to find a group where i truly belong, but at least i'm grateful to my only irl best friend, however rarely i see him, and my gf who's always by my side. if i'm feeling this deep loneliness with them around, i can't even imagine how i'd be feeling if i was truly alone\n\ni think what makes me feel the most lonely is past childhood friends that abandoned me, and who, no matter how much i've tried to get back with, always gave me the cold shoulder, and it's so triggering, they used to be the only people i thought could understand me, and now that they probably don't like me anymore, or got tired and bored of me, love to hit me with the \"we went on separate paths\" bullshit, yeah i get that, but can't you even check up on me once on an entire year? and no, not just because something dumb reminded you of me and you want to make some meaningless small talk, or vent to me cuz you have no one else at that certain moment and then fuck off again\n\nand i know deep down it's because of me being neurodivergent, my deep awkwardness always made people give me the weird looks, which are another trigger of mine, it's so tiring trying my best, consuming my soul to act as normal as possible, no matter how much of a meltdown i might be having on the inside, and it's still not enough, no matter how \"normal\" i try to be, i'm still treated and seen as an abomination\n\nwhat made me internalize it even more was being treated exactly the same way by mental health institution, fuck, i will never forget being almost laughed at by psychiatrists just for trying to explain my adhd symptoms, like the mentalities here are beyond insane, these people think adhd doesn't exist or it's ONLY in kids and it magically goes away once your age turns to 18. i had to argue and fight for a diagnosis, and all of this just made me feel even more beyond saving. like even therapists and psychiatrists don't understand me and treat me like an alien? i'm scared of even trying therapy anymore at this point, it literally caused me trauma as i had to internalize so much shit from them, one in particular tried to trick me into thinking that i have absolutely no issues, as long as i get out of bed, i can't be depressed, for example, and many other examples like that with everything else, it's all \"in your head\", it's not illness, it's \"weakness\". yes, a therapist was trying to teach me Andrew Tateish level of stoicism, it's ridiculous at this point\n\ni am hopeful though, at least now i'm starting to understand myself better and i know i'll eventually find the right people for me, ngl i did make a few nice friends over reddit, even if it didn't work out with 99% of the people i talked to, it's nice to just feel understood and listened to, even if i had to go through insecurity triggering scenarios like getting suddenly ghosted or just ignored a lot of the time. i see it as facing my trauma and becoming a better version of myself, however painful it is sometimes\n\ni def have so much more to say, i've only scratched the tip of the iceberg, but it's getting so long already, so i'll leave it at that. thank you for listening to my ted talk LOL, and whoever reads this, hope your day is going good, it really helps a lot to just vent all of this out, putting what's on my mind, however hard it can be, into words, is so cathartic, really makes me feel more at peace\n\nthank you for listening.",

            "comment": "So much of what you wrote brought back memories of what I went through when I was younger. I'm on the spectrum (Aspergers) but I didn't get officially diagnosed till my late forties. I always suspected and had a few therapists speculate but, like you, my concerns were more often brushed aside.  I dealt a lot with being the outcast, the \"weirdo\", the guy who never fit in. High school was absolute hell. It did start to get better in my twenties, I began to learn how to deal with people better just through continuing to practice, kind of a \"fake it till you make it\" strategy. But doing that brings its own peculiar issues. You never feel quite...genuine. You're not lying to people exactly but you are in a sense. To me, it was the price I had to pay to have any chance at a social life at all.  It's very often a tough path to walk but it's not like you got to choose it. In my twenties again, I had to come to grips with the fact that I wasn't like most other people.  I was born this way and I have to deal with it as best I can. It is exhausting and frustrating and quite often painful. But I've worked, had friendships and been in relationships. Look, I'm not trying to blow smoke or give you some smarmy pep talk. None of this is easy. The hardest part for me was having patience with myself and figuring out how to navigate the \"normie\" world through trial and error.  I dunno if any of this helps. Just thought hearing from someone who has lived through similar experiences might give you some perspective. Be well.",

            "comment": "I am ADHD and ASD too. I hope you get support and find peers like you. \n\nI would not be in the mess I'm in now if I'd maintained a support system. But I worked in an adrenaline-charged field for decades which effectively enabled me to function. I did absolutely nothing else but work and then my industry collapsed. \n\nThings really will get so much better for you but it's going to be a lifelong challenge to maintain external support. \n\nWith ADHD it is very easy to get subsumed in workaholism, or sex, or drugs, or gaming, or trauma bonded relationships or hell, birdwatching ... until that is all there is and it feels normal. \n\n But if you can get help and never stop getting it at the same time, in tandem with your distractions, you can have a great life. \nI am sorry you are feeling so bad right now but the good news is, nothing is worse than the pre diagnosis phase.",

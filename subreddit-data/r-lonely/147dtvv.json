    "postText": "I'd say since I was about 16, I've always felt lonely. I think around 19 I accepted that this would last forever, and in accepting it I became comfortable with it.\n\nI turned 24 this month, and recently I've been feeling nothing but anxiety and sadness thinking about my loneliness, like I wish I could do a do-over, or manage to turn things around -- but at the same time it feels way too late for that. I'm thinking about all the experiences I never really got, I never was social in highschool, I never went to college, I never got to enjoy being outside hanging out during summer vacations, never had a girlfriend, never had a kiss...\n\nThis year I plan on taking some community college classes part-time while I work, I feel part of this plan is driven by my desire to experience that which I missed out on -- college life -- even though I know that this isn't the same experience at all as it will just be taking a couple of classes during the week, and I'm mainly doing it for pragmatic reasons, I can't help but feel this pull towards making up for what I missed out on with what little there is of my young adult hood, if mid-20's even counts as young adult still.\n\nI wish I could go back to just being comfortable with my loneliness, but I'm feeling so much anxiety right now from it. For the past five years I was completely at peace with the concept of loneliness for my entire life, never doubting it, never really complaining about it, and now that's all crumbling at the moment. It feels like a mid-life crisis in my 20s, as I look around at younger people enjoying life, and experience things I never have and never will. And yet I am the youngest I will ever be again so I have to do something to mix things up. The past 3 years of my life have been a blur especially and I need to slow it down.",

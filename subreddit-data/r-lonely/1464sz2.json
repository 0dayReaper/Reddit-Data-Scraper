            "comment": "Panic attacks are scary for sure, you\u2019ve already tried breathing into a bag to regulate your breathing? Once you have your breathing under control your heart rate should slow. Take a moment to just sit and focus on controlling your breathing, in through the mouth, out through the nose.\n\nThis will serve to both bring you down from the attack and focus your mind. Outside of that, if you\u2019re unsure of the cause then I\u2019d suggest talking to someone about any issues you may be having in your life right now. Face the demons rather than bottling them up so to speak.\n\nHope you feel better and wish you the best of luck!",

As it get better, try in for 5 hold for 1 out for 10 but don't force it.  Don't even try to think about what caused the attack. Focus on breathing.  I've dealt with anxiety my whole life in all kinds of situations and getting my breathing under control has always been step 1. Hang in there. It's ok.",

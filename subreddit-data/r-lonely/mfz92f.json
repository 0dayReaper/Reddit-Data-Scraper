All relationships start from a place of friendship. Do you have any hobbies? Do you you have anything that you'd like to volunteer some time with? [VolunteerMatch](https://www.volunteermatch.org/)\n- Third, be approachable. In general terms, people like talking about themselves, so ask questions. Be interested in their replies. Ask followup questions. Even if the conversation goes somewhere that you don't find particularly interesting, be genuinely happy for them.\n\nGood luck.\n\nOh yes, and *here* is an internet hug.",

Not everyone is going to feel the same way about you as you do about them, that's life.\n\nMy suggestion would be, if you get friend zoned, to have an honest private conversation with them, where you open up and say that as much as you do enjoy their friendship, you were hoping for more. That way, it gets it out into the open, and they can either respond to that, or confirm that you're wasting your time, and allow you to focus your romantic energies elsewhere.",

It is literally physical abuse to be alone long term, and eventually, it will kill. I used to think that was hyperbole until I actually looked into it.

I hate my life.\n\nIn primary school 5-10 I used to absurdly popular, aka one of the popular kids..\n\nI literally had a gf for like 3 months.. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then my life has been terrible, I've never had one since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get teased all the time by girls who ask me dumb questions like \"Are you from Poland?\"\n\nI've received compliments that are so easy to tell they're just mocking me.. they'll say stuff like \"You could be a model\" after literally saying I could work in an office when im older.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish I couldn't be this lonely..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stay inside and alone for practically 18 hours a day, my brother, sister and parents are the only people who stay here too.",

Even when she was here the first night my mind was in a different world I'm just not here.  I had this young good looking girl next to me and I'm just not present my mind is in lala land",

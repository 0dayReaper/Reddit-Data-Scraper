I\u2019m \u201crude\u201d, I don\u2019t have the im here to make friends in my bio so when people message me randomly I\u2019m very much like what the fuck do you want? \n\nWhile I know I\u2019m lonely and feel like I\u2019ll never find a connection sometimes, I also know i don\u2019t trust anyone. Nor will I probably trust someone anytime soon. Hence the hostility from me.\n\nI\u2019m really unsure why someone would set themselves up to get messages only to be fucking rude. That is actually uncalled for. They shouldn\u2019t say message me if they don\u2019t want messages.",

            "comment": "Well, let's be honest. I am rather social being myself, but if someone intrudes at a time or out of nowhere when I didnt expect them too, I will be rather catched off guard, and based on my mood, the reaction changes. Since no one is in a mood to talk all the time. Whatever the bio may say. Whatever people may pretend to be. It's the same thing when people say they \"talk to anyone\". It's easier to say that than to create a list for all the people they won't talk to. \n\nSometimes, people don't also respond because they found their chat partner already, I made a post a while ago, and I have adhd and I tend to fixate quite a lot. \nSo when I found someone I could talk to for hours, I did. Sadly, the others that reached out later I had to turn down or respond to minimally and that made me feel guilty. But I only got one dysfunctional brain and two rather untalented hands. \n\nSo the illusion of people being 100% available, social, in the mood 24/7 is just not real. \n\nJust because you were there, you reached out, and their info said that they would respond. It doesn't mean that this is reallife accurate data. \n\nI am not hating on you here. But see it as a multifaceted issue, and people aren't always linear. Which means bad or good people. \n\nI got ignored, I sadly had to ignore, I had more important irl problems. Everyone operates under different motivations, and we shouldn't hate on others because we don't fit their schedule.",

In the end, he just wanted something shady or sexual. Reddit/Internet is full of pretenders and people that give you an illusion of something. So just watch out. But don't let your heart get dark in the process. We all have genuine kindness in us that will eventually reach the right people. If we turn the back to the world. The world can't see us (:",

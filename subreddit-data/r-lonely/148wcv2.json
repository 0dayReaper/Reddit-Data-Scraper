Unless of course that makes you feel good doing that then you do you.\n\nI think that for people who keeps thinking and asking themselves why even try or do xyz, if they are going to die anyways, are just making excuses to give up and not live. It\u2019s easy, really easy to just give up and play that game. I see it as childish, like how kids sit and cry because that\u2019s all they know to do. To me it\u2019s like they haven\u2019t grown out of that childish phase and it has taken over. So they want to mentally revert back to where they are ignorant of the world, so they can live the life of a kid again that gets taken care of in a big scary world.",

    "postText": "when I see other people irl and then look at myself I just feel like a freak. I'm 26 with no social life, never had a relationship before,  hugless kissless sexless virgin.\n\nI can't help but think when people look at me they're laughing or disgusted. When I hear groups of kids ESPECIALLY teenagers laughing i think the worst and feel like it's at me. I know I need therapy or something at this point but I can't afford it. Lol I feel so miserable and lonely. I don't necessarily want a gf.. I just want company and someone who relates to me",

            "comment": "Acceptance is a truly invaluable thing for a human being to learn and master. To me it's one of the pillars of becoming an adult and healthy human being. And it doesn't come easy. You have to learn how to accept things and life will constantly test you on it.\n\nOther people also have a way of showing us who we really are by how we react to them. Who we are seems to be combination of different images. How we see ourselves. How others see us (which can vary dramatically from person to person). How other think we see ourselves. And even how we think others think we see ourselves.\n\nAll of this forms a self-image that depicts to our minds who we are, and dictates our thoughts, feelings and behavior. Like a script or system directive.\n\nYou're at a stage where it seems like you are able to distinguish between how others might see you and how you see yourself. Recognizing that the one which matters is the latter. Because how others perceive you is something you have minimal control over.\n\nYou're developing self-trust and that breed integrity and confidence.\n\nYou're also coming to recognize the social need in an objective way rather than being controlled by it, and learning to value your own company. But remember that a huge part (if not the biggest) of human fulfillment comes from relationships and interaction with others. Just something to keep in mind.",

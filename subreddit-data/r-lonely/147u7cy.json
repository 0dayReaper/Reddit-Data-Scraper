    "postText": "Especially if you have no family. It's almost as though you've ceased to have relevance to the world at large. \nI feel nothing but shame about being over 40 (female), creative and interesting but unable to find a decent mate. That's all I want at this point: a damn husband. Yet it seems the only men who try to chat me up are trashy, uneducated losers with nothing to offer a parakeet, let alone an intelligent adult. \nI blame my lack of family on my persistent single status; i have zero frame of reference when it comes to healthy relationships, and unfortunately, family is ridiculously important when it comes to dating. That's how potential partners decide what level of emotional investment you deserve. No family = no investment, because you're \"too clingy\", \"needy\", and of course, \"why should i give you what your family won't?\"\n\nIt's shite, i tell you. Utter shite. Makes me want to shin-kick the people who whine about being lonely but are married, have families, have kids... That's a lack of gratitude for what you have, not loneliness.\n\n\nEDIT: Wow, a woman can't know her own value without people trying to take her down, eh?\n\n For reference: I am not \"overweight\". I dress nicely every day. I have a college education. (Berklee College of Music if you really must know) I am currently writing a novel. \n\nWhat approaches me: *uneducated* guys (not college graduates) with whom i could not carry on a conversation and will not carry financially. \n\nNo, I'm not spoilt, I'm looking for an equal partner. If that offends you, oh well. Figure out your own value instead of denigrating those who know theirs.\n\nFYI, not on the app, so no inboxing",

If that offends you, oh well. Figure out your own value instead of denigrating those who know theirs.\n\nI think you dug yourself an even bigger hole here. What makes you think a man who doesn't have a college degree can't carry on a conversation with you, can't pull his weight financially, and otherwise just be your equal? Education is not intelligence. Advanced degrees are only weakly correlated with income, besides which it's 2023 and a man shouldn't have to \"carry financially\" a woman these days. That doesn't sound like an equal, that sounds like someone superior to you. You're judging people based on their accomplishments rather than who they are, their character and values. I hate to say the words, because they're often said in unfair circumstances, but maybe \"this is why you're single.\" And childless, in your 40's. (Although you claim to have never wanted children anyway in comments, so good for you there I guess. Same here.)\n\nI really want to agree with you too. Some people aren't gracious for what they have, and you shouldn't have to settle for someone way below your level. However, there's more than one way to measure a person's value and your view seems to be overly narrow. You sound insufferable. Oh well. That's your problem, not mine.",

But your original post.\n\n(and honestly I didnt see many trolls..but I do see people taking offense with the tone)",

You're ignoring all the other people out there that are over 40, still single with no family, and have still found love.  \n\nYou have it in you to call people \"trashy, uneducated losers\".  That says a lot about you as a person.  I don't care how good you think you are, talking down on others brings you down a notch and is a great way to make others unattracted to you.  People with spouses and families can absolutely be lonely.  It's very insensitive of you to belittle their suffering and assume they are just ungrateful.  \n\nYou're 45 and still don't have any frame of reference for a normal, healthy relationship.  Have you been working with a professional?  Have you ever been around couples or had healthy friendships before?",

Maybe a lot of people do, sure, but some people come from abusive families and want to distance themselves from them. I'm sure a lot of people don't mind a clingy person, so as long as they manage their clinginess. And even then, there are people who find clinginess cute.\n\nI have to ask, what is it you offer in a relationship exactly? Not just materially speaking, but mentally/emotionally? Based on your post, you sound extremely judgemental and entitled. That's a big turn off for a lot of people. Calling less privileged individuals losers says a lot about your character.\n\nNot saying you should drop your standards, but maybe take some time to self-reflect and be honest with them. Standards are important for healthy relationships IMO, but yours might be unrealistic.",

It\u2019s hard to appreciate your loneliness because everyone around you is probably married and/or with kids, but just think of all the horrible things you get to miss out on. Right now, you get to wake up whenever tf you want, cook whatever tf you want, eat from out when you feel like it, take a nap when you feel like it, go to the movies when you feel like it(yes, plenty of people go to the movies by themselves), argue with NO one, get an entire bed and house to yourself, etc. You never have to worry about being cheated on or if you\u2019re being too selfish in the relationship or if you carelessly hurt one of your loved ones. You\u2019re truly living a life of freedom. \n\nSociety has nailed this belief into our heads that we\u2019re supposed to get married and have kids and do all sorts of things but there really is no such rule like that. At the end of the day, every person ends up alone because that\u2019s how cruel death is. You could have the happiest marriage in the world for years but when your loved one suddenly dies at an old age, the devastation is indescribable. By being alone now, you\u2019ll never have to go through the pain of losing someone like that. I can\u2019t tell you how many marriages in my family ended in that manner, and all of the wives were completely devastated for years until they finally were free to pass away. I\u2019m sounding really negative, but I\u2019m really just trying to be honest. Don\u2019t let society\u2019s outdated beliefs ruin your happiness.",

Good for you for knowing your worth.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that as we grow older, our dating pool gets smaller. If you're looking for fellow educated and successful individuals, that pool gets even smaller. So, don't be surprised if you're having trouble finding a partner.\n\nAlso, you really need to look in the mirror and see that there's something wrong with your attitude too. Not the part where you're choosy (you definitely have the right to be selective and not lower your standards), but the way you communicate and judge others.\n\nLastly, loneliness and being alone are different. I've explained that many times on this sub before. It is definitely possible to feel lonely even if you have a family or relationships. You don't have the right to gatekeep loneliness. You're not the only one who is hurting. That's part of your attitude that you need to change.",

There is NOTHING wrong with it.  There is nothing wrong with most peoples standards, even if they arent the same as yours or mine. Whatever works for them!\n\nI had a conversation with more than a few guy friends over the years as I navigated the dating waters.Asking about family isnt always about marriage.Some are recently out of a relationship/long term stuff that they are trying to ask deeper questions. Either because they are nervous about someone like their ex/etc, or because they lack in knowledge of how to effectively date/how far to push topics on early dates.\n\nSome guys or girls seem to be trying to sus out if a person has alot of \"emotional baggage\".Ie: if you are lacking in alot of social connections, it can be a bit of a red flag. And thats true.  Even though I personally fit that red flag.Family being the number one thing most people have strong connections to, so they want to know WHY you don't have that expected social norm connection.\n\nAnd then theres a guy I dated once who kept pressuring about family and wanting to know the details of why I would choose to cut family off.(we talked a few months later when I ran into him randomly at a bar/restaurant).He said he approaches dates from a bit of an enterntainment mindset.  He finds it \"fun\" to find out the dirt and see how far people will go down the rabbit hole in explanations.  Think \"Jerry Springer\" style.Pretty shitty imo. Glad I didn't date him again.\n\nBUT, I do see many are not wanting marriage in this age group. At least in my experience, they ARENT looking for marriage.Its either looking to have friends with benefits, or (on the other side0 life partners.  Either way in our 40's its natural to become more selective and want more of what we value.  OFC thats normal.We don't want to spend years dating around.  So we set our expectations and want lists etc.But it still doesnt mean that people are trying to ascertain your marriage potential, but are searching out those \"red flags\" early.Still I feel they are going about it the wrong way.Dont push past my boundaries I set.we dont need to share ALL the dirt at once.\n\nHaving said all this, there are some apps out there or groups that I feel are meant for someone with your desires in a partner.  Since you bring alot to the table, if you qualify for those groups, you should check them out.Elite Singles I think is one. There are so many out there.But either way this age on up is DIFFICULT.\n\nEveryone at this age comes with a bit less flexibility since we have experienced life and know more of what we want and dont want.  It makes it rought sometimes.",

Easier.  more relatable.\n\nThat is the ISSUE that most people have here.  Relatability.  And Tone.\n\nIts like when you explained about borgia: it comes off not as you are trying to explain because someone was genuinely curious...but was explained in the next sentence because you feel they are lesser/dumber/insert descriptor of your choice here, than you.  I mean I genuinely enjoyed reading what the actual meaning was, but I also understood the term just from the context of the sentence and having seen it used before. (But again I didn't know the originating meaning).\n\nhowever, no one asked either for that explanation. Idk if you are getting my meaning here.\n\nIt just was extraneous.I'm telling you its the tone. And yes there is plenty of tone one can convey in text.\n\nOh. So I would kinda consider it a sideways version of \"Mansplaining\"  a bit, if you want to think of it coming off kinda in that way. Pretentious? Arrogant?**And please understand Im not calling you that.**  Im explaining how it comes off in tone.The communication is highly intelligent but very arrogant in tone.",

She doubled down, decided to use more harsh labeling/terminology to indicate anyone who doesn't have a degree is trashy. \nShe outright said several times about lack of degree being part of her determination for being trashy.\n\nAnd so yeah, she got more negative responses.\n\n There is a certain group of people as well who use the term mate, and I'm sure you know who that is.

I don't know her personally, maybe she is judgmental, I don't know.   \n\nAs for your reference about the word 'mate' I honestly don't know what you are talking about.

I just feel badly for all of us here who ARE trying to date in our 40s or above. Since thats what this thread is about.Its a different world. not just due to age, but also post-Covid.So when ever you do get out there, if you decide to head into the waters, best of luck and try to relax and just go with the flow.\n\nAnd about the mate thing, if thats true.You wont see people using \"im looking for a mate\" or using the word \"Mate\" at all in reference to finding a lover/partner/life/partner/wife/husband/etc -except certain \"incel\" groups who post alot of alpha content/comments.  There are some well known speakers who do use that word alot. And no, they aren't respectful to women.  \nIs the word \"mate\" disrespectful? no.  Not really. BUT its very...basic. Its something that is used in the animal world as a descriptor.  Its used now in groups to describe the level of connection you would have with someone.  A mate, by definition, refers to a sexual partner.  \nnoun  \n1.  \nthe sexual partner of a bird or other animal.  \n\"a male bird sings to court a mate\"  \n\n\nIF thats all someone is looking for then I am pretty sure they would do better to label it more as \"lover\" or \"friends with benefits\" etc.  \n\n\nAnd the incel community has latched onto the word quite a bit.",

I probably won't be on this thread much longer. I just hate seeing groupthink on reddit and other sites where people will gang up on someone for having a differing opinion. Especially if I feel like the person didn't deserve it.\n\nWell thank you for bringing that to my attention. It's funny because I don't ever say that in real life. After you mentioned I realized it would be weird to say out loud or even put on a dating profile. I don't know why I chose it honestly. Writing is a different medium I guess. I was just writing hastily so that's what I came up with.\n\nI didn't realize that community had latched onto that word. I definitely see the implied animalistic/sexual nature of it. I never really stopped to think about the connotations of it.  I'm definitely glad you told me, I don't want to be associated with them in any way.\n\nAnd yes dating does get harder as we get older yet. I'm not in my 40s yet but will be soon. I have a lot of self reflection and growing to do as an individual before I decide I'm going to start dating again. I might be 40 by then lol.",

I never got a sexist vibre from them , but I guess it's easier to blame others for your situation than to actually reflect and see that maybe the problem is you.  At 45 she should know that. She asked questions and she got answers, she just didn't like them. \n\n&gt;They\u2019re angry and projecting their own lack of sexual partners onto her. Aka incels. \u201cOh women have it so easy, they don\u2019t have to do anything and they just have guys coming up wanting to fuck them. I wouldn\u2019t turn down a 100lb heroin mule that just sucked 100 dicks if she approached me.\"\n\nThat is all in your head lmao. Literally nobody said this. Don't put YOUR words and thoughts in other people's mouths.",

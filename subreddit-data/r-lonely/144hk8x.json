    "postText": "2 years ago I split from my only friend and I haven't made any friends since. In college I really wanted to make friends with the new people I'd be meeting, but my anxiety wouldn't allow me to, and even when someone in my class asked if I wanted to have lunch with them, I said no like an idiot. I ended up dropping out because I couldn't keep up with the work and I felt like I wasn't talented enough to be there. Turns out I'm on the spectrum so that explains a lot of things. \n\nI feel like I'm being ungrateful because my parents love me, and I'm really close with my sister even tho she's moved out and lives in London now. I find myself having imaginary conversations from time to time with my ex-bestfriend, because I don't have any friends now. I would describe myself as an introvert but the solitude and loneliness has started to drive me mad. I don't want to be like this forever. I need to meet new people and experience something but my autistic brain won't let me. I wouldn't say that I'm suicidal, but I occasionally feel like my life is pointless. I just need to interact with someone who isn't a family member.",

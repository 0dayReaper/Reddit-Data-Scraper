    "postText": "Two days ago, I was blocked by someone who I was somewhat close to on everything. \nThey didn\u2019t tell me why whatsoever- and they left me confused, and frankly a little hurt.\n\nWe shared extremely similar interests and we would talk and laugh all the time in geometry class. Their smile would brighten up my day a lot, and they\u2019re the most funniest, coolest friend I could ever have. \nWe never really fought at all, I gave them space when they needed it too. I was there for them regardless and helped them through rough patches in their life. I don\u2019t recall doing anything bad to them, there was a time where I was distant due to stress from work and classes, but I\u2019m worried that I might\u2019ve hurt them in some way. \nRight now I feel absolutely terrible. \nI already messaged them asking if everything was okay, and apologizing to them, but they never replied. I\u2019m still waiting. \n\nThey mean a lot to me. I just don\u2019t know what I did wrong, I posted an Instagram story stating how I was going to deactivate due to mental health issues, and when they saw the story, they blocked me completely. \nPlease don\u2019t be too harsh on them, I don\u2019t hate them by any means, and even if they hate me, I just hope they\u2019re doing okay.",

If it makes you feel better it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s them. I know you still want to be in their life regardless but that piece of advice helps. My dms are open if u wanna talk.",

            "comment": "Same. My best friend since middle school has ghosted and re-contacted me several times, and the first 2 times I gave back in. Just know it isn't you, it's them. They would come up with some dumb excuse each time as to why they left, just to blow up on you as soon as they leave. If they contact you again, it's okay to continue the friendship (I believe in second chances:) ), but if they do it again, don't contact them or give in. These kinds of people are not stable mentally and they often project their anger onto you by blocking you and blaming you for their issues.",

He was super cool guy, always helpful, empathetic or so it seemed. Then he just deleted me no explanation and that was that. When I was having really difficult time as well.\n\nThen he messaged me few years later asking to hang out. Just like that lol. When I asked what happened he didn't really give me clear explanation, except some excuse that he deleted his socials and couldn't contact me.\n\nI don't know what's wrong with me but I still like the guy, no hate towards him whatsoever but I felt like I had to decline if I wanted to keep some respect for myself. Fool me once and all that.\n\nYears ago I took it for granted that he deleted me like oh he probably hates me that makes  sense, I hate myself too lol. If I were you I would probably give him a call to clear things up. Probably what I'd do in this situation right now.",

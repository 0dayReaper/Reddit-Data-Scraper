    "postText": "Hello everyone that gave the time to read this post recently in my life in my relationship with my gf of 5 years I always get yelled at or made to feel stupid because I don\u2019t say the right things when my gf is mad or feeling anxiety today she was feeling down because she hates her job so I said \u201cyou\u2019re not trapped at this job and there\u2019s many opportunities out there you just have to look for them\u201d and I offered to work overtime to help support the finances if she needed a day off or just time to get that mental reset but I was called inconsiderate and weak because I tend to apologize if I say something wrong or take blame for the things I do like if I said something rude or misunderstand something I will apologize but be told I have no spine and need to stop and when I do stand up for myself I\u2019m toxic and should be ashamed of myself so I\u2019ve been feeling very depressed and feel like crying because maybe I am a spineless loser that can\u2019t function in a relationship idk my self confidence is nonexistent now. Thank you for reading my rant/getting this off my chest hope everyone is having a better day",

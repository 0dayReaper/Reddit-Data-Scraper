I live with housemates who mostly do their own thing. \n\nI am looking new friends from the UK/ EU (sorry it\u2019s a time zone thing)\n\nHappy to chit chat about anything really. \n\nI must add\u2026. I suffer for anxiety. So I may not reply on some days. I find it easier so as not to let my negativity affect other. But I will most certainly reply. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to get at is I\u2019ll be a ghost free fwend.\n\nLove watching Netflix, playing games, listening to music. The usual stuff really.\n\nHit me up and let\u2019s chat \ud83d\ude18",

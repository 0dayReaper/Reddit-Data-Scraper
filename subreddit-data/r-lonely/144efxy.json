Hence the title; a play on \"Et tu, Brute?\", where instead of Brutus, False Love or \"Falsus Amor\" has forsaken me.\n\nIt's not even about the money, it's the fact that even False Love has forsaken me.\n\nWhat do I do now?",

It's also attainable by anyone but unfortunately for many of us it's also heavily dependent on luck and being in the right place at the right time. Lots of people come and go but we just keep going and hope to meet our 'verus amor'.",

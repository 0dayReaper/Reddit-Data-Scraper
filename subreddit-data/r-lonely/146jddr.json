    "postText": "that's what usually happens. If I am angry they think that is ok, but being angry is just a mask for being sad. it is better to just be sad and suffer in silence. Obviously I have my good and bad days and can't be happy 100% of the time but people expect me to be some fake person whos always happy, charismatic, and entertaining. Most people are fake and will find bullshit reasons to leave or stay. I left all my dating apps and gave up on dating after being hurt for years. I try my best it's not my fault I'm not good enough for everyone. Once I become successful then they will try to stay but I don't want anyone anymore, I hate everybody. Sorry being an uber driver and working on my music and startup/dev isn't good enough for you compared to being a corporate slave! Sorry having my own house isn't good enough compared to paying 4k a month to live in a hip closet ! Fuck society !",

I recently thought I met someone who genuinely understands me but when I opened up about some shit I\u2019ve been through she just ghosted me with no explanation. I don\u2019t get it. If you open up about what you been through you\u2019re often seen as weak but when in reality it just shows how strong you are. I just wish more women would see it that way. Also could you send any links to your music? I\u2019d love to check it out",

If your a famous celebrity or rich you can be real but if your average which 90% of guys are, it feels like you have to kind of mask yourself unfortunately.\n\nYeah sure I can send a link later maybe, I get self-conscious about it lol.  \n\n\nAnother thing is they always ask about how much money I have or whatever, I try to play it off like I don't have a whole lot because I don't want to be with a gold digger but then they'll leave. Or they ask if I'm going to be rich like Idk let me look into my crystal ball but if that's all you care abt then I'd rather just be with someone else.",

You\u2019re far from weak. Your feelings are valid. If they leave bc you opened up, give yourself a round of applause. You\u2019ve just weeded out a shitty human being from your life. No more time wasted. \n\nI see that a lot of men are coming across more and more shallow women. It\u2019s very unfortunate, especially for women who aren\u2019t. You\u2019re doing great!

Just because I am in a bad mood maybe once or twice a week doesn't mean I'm depressed or bipolar or whatever . That's totally normal and people need to stop acting like they are perfect all the time because no one is. But that one time I express myself, they will be like I hope you feel better and then stop talking to me like I'm dying from cancer or something lol.  It's like when I drive for Uber one time I made one wrong turn and the person was like \"I'm going to die\" and started nagging me for the rest of the night telling me where to turn when I already know where to go on the app it was annoying asf.  \n\n\nYou are right though there are people like that . It's just frustrating because I feel like every move I make is being judged when I'm getting to know someone and I just want to be myself and say whats on my mind .

It can be difficult for someone if you're always emotionally dumping on them. I've been guilty of this myself. It's important to find a healthy middle ground.",

    "postText": "Flair: Vent, Discussion? I cant select both\n\ntl;dr at the end.\r  \n\r  \nTakeaway for personal reasons...I am a college student, first year.\r  \n\r  \nDuring high school I had a little friend group of 3 people and me. After high school we just drifted apart, one of them works, the other 2 are in different cities/universities. There was a school trip abroad for like a week on which I couldnt participate due to financial problems. There was also a graduation ceremony and a party that I couldnt go because I was at the hospital...\r  \n\r  \nAfter I got enrolled in university my high school classmates had a little reunion and I wasnt invited. When i asked one of them (former friend group member) they just shrugged it off, so I kind of distanced and cut them off.\r  \n\r  \nAs for the people in university, I tried my best to socialize. I think i have a bad trait of self-isolating when something happens to me, so i lost those new friends real quick. Is it really hard to make friends? Or am i just not sociable... I made a friend recently whom I could talk to, they ghosted me for a good reason but it still hurt. My partner told me I'm socially awkward and speak quite negatively, but I didnt really notice that.\r  \n\r  \nI've been feeling really down as of late, and I have no one I can really talk to. I shut down all social media because theres really...no reason for me to use them. I looked through websites and talked to AI's, most of them said go to clubs and talk to people, but university is quite hard at the moment (its exam season aswell so ill be locked up at home for a while), so i dont have much free time.\r  \n\r  \nIs there anything I've been doing wrong, or what should I do to make a friend? Any advice is greatly appreciated!\r  \n\r  \ntl;dr: Due to self-isolation, awkwardness and other circumstances I've lost all my friends/didnt make any. Help?",

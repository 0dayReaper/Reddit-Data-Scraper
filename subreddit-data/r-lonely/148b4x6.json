She's been in my head all day, every day for the past 3 months.\r  \n\r  \nWe never dated but we were friends for a short time but she told me to leave her alone and that she doesn't want to see me anymore.\r  \n\r  \nI love her and I want her to be happy, so I will continue to leave her alone. But I keep holding on to hope that she'll let me be part of her life again.\r  \n\r  \nI've never been more miserable, confused and alone. I have no idea what to do.\r  \n\r  \nI have literally been crying all day :(",

Air your frustration and sadness.\n- the more you talk about it now the less you need to talk or think about it in the long run. \n- don't stop finding over friends or create a space for her to come back to. You shouldn't do that to yourself and she shouldn't have that power over you \n- pick up a hobby to distract you for the meantime in a month or two from now the pain and sadness will start to just pop up occasionally. \n- small steps my man\n- and please for the love of God. Don't think about wanting to be  a part of her life again while you have feelings that are neither healthy for a friendship nor Respectful. You will end up being the toxic and hurt one for being the guy in the friendzone. You are better than  this. You will be better than this! \n\nIn the future, my man. People will stay in your life because of you and not because you want them to stay desperately.",

And ofcourse others don't have to. But that doesn't mean that noone will. \nTake it from someone who had his fair share of experiences. There will be people that see that in you what you like others to see. \nAnd then all the people who didn't are just a forgotten memory. \n\nTalk about it.\nScream it out. \nTurn up your music. \n\nAnd then don't forget that the next day is a new day. \nAnd that step by step. We step it up and not let ourselves be dragged down by people that don't want us in the first place. \n\nSince the right person want to see you in a good mood, in a positive state, ok! \n\nSo treat yourself kindly. \nAnd allow yourself to be hurt but just not forever my friend.",

I fueled myself with my own emotions. It took months when I felt better. But I did it Mindfully. \nHobbies are there to keep you busy. The more gym I did the more mentally exhausted I was to sit there thinking. And eventually I regulated it better. \n\nTry something. Stick your mind to it. Even if it helps just 1% every day. In a week that's 7% improvement. \nSo just keep at it. Don't give up on yourself. You have something to give to the world. Just because one person didn't want it doesn't mean that others don't need it.",

How much did you k ow her to be able to say you love her? You don\u2019t. You love the idea of her in your brain constructed but your ass self lol \n\nBelieve me, you get over it by coming to reality and you come to reality by getting it on with some other girl. \n\nIt may not feel good, or you may still think of her for some time but get up go find yourself someone else and move on from your own self. It\u2019s not her. \n\nAlso dive into your childhood and likely you find why you so easily depend on someone who didn\u2019t even want you as much. \n\nDon\u2019t linger in pain.

It pissed him off so much that he took the rag he was wiping off the bar with and threw it across the bar. I asked him if something was wrong. He told me why I just told you. And he added that her boyfriend doesn't treat her right and all that jazz. I looked at him and asked him if she was pissed too. He looked at me confused, and said no. And I told him that he's the only one making himself miserable. She's happy. I know it's hard as hell but you have to move on, op because you're the only one making yourself miserable right now. And you really need to stop that ,man. Not healthy. I'm saying that as a 45 year old man,living alone and doesn't have friends or family. I know my advice is hard to follow. But we have no choice. If you really need someone to talk to. I'm here. Won't hold my breath, though.",

He stopped talking to me and I don't know what happened. It's been 2 weeks now and I still hope he'll reach out, but we both just have to let them go and let time heal. If they don't want to talk to us anymore, then there's nothing we can do about it.",

Best advice I can give you is get busy and stop overthinking, talk to other girls. When you think about her remind yourself that your basically strangers cause y\u2019all didn\u2019t even date and that she clearly wants nothing to do with you(she said it herself). Stop thinking crazy and forget about her with time you\u2019ll realize that she\u2019s not everything and that you were crazy even thinking this way. Please don\u2019t do anything drastic just leave her alone give it some time and you\u2019ll stop having those feelings. In future relationships remind yourself to not get overly attached especially if you are not even dating. Don\u2019t ever be or sound desperate, once the other person sees that you\u2019re done.",

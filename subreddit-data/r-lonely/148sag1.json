I still can't believe so many women treat me weird when I am being romantic. It's like their defences go up, and I feel there is something wrong with me. Even though all I want to do is make them feel special because they are important to me. But sadly the world made romantic guys out to be creeps that just want one thing. \nSo my list is not demanding if you read it in context. :)\n\nEdit: Rereading what I wrote, it sounds a bit argumentative. Sorry. That was not intended at all. I thank you for your kind words, and take to heart what you wrote.",

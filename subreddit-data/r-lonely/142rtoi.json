    "postText": "Hey guys I\u2019m so lonely. I think I might be falling into a spiral of depression again. My ex had moved on and I can\u2019t see myself without him. I know people say a new boyfriend won\u2019t fill the void, but at this point I think it will. I just want a partner so bad. I\u2019m done trying with dating apps and such. I\u2019m just so lost and lonely . I don\u2019t even have friends anymore since everyone separated after high school. Can anyone just idk send a DM with uplifting words I\u2019m just so down. I want a lover\ud83d\ude15 I\u2019m a 19F in SoCal.",

            "comment": "Hmm.........uplifting words of encouragement? Hmm.....tough one. Nothing ever said to me during the times that I went through what you're going through ever felt like anything more than hollow sympathy, sorry.\n\nFor me what worked was to simply talk. Talk about little things, my break up (with all the anger and rears), food, fishing, anything really as long as I was speaking and so was someone else. Texting like this never helped me, but it might work for you and others. I'm not discounting it in any way so please don't interpret it that way.\n\nI'm pretty much always up for chatting so get in touch if you ever feel like it! Hope you feel better soon!",

And you know , everyone works different so maybe a boyfriend could fill a void for you \nTry to see your good  qualities , you will realize some guys would like you as your girlfriend \nEveryone is different to there is hope!",

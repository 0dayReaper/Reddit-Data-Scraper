    "postText": "I\u2019m not sure if that makes me sound naive. Maybe bots have been flooding Reddit for a while, and everyone knows.\n\nI found an unusually affirming comment that I connected with so much, I had to check out the user\u2019s profile to get to know them better, but it was suspiciously empty of content: new, no posts, lots of comments.\n\nAll of its comments had the same perfect, inhuman cadence I sense from ChatGPT.  It almost sounds like a foreigner with a perfect grasp of the English language.\n\nIt had given the usual \u201cmake hobbies, and make friends\u201d advice, but in a way that suggested doing so was a moral good living in a selfish society (a challenge for me to be better than everyone else). At the same time, I do not disagree with any of its advice. Lol\n\nIt was also suspiciously willing to chat with anyone (although many real people here are open to chatting). But I just don\u2019t see \u201csomeone\u201d that cogent having no friends or responsibilities of their own, and therefore, having enough time to chat with everyone they reply to.  I must imagine a literal saint sworn to sacrifice on the other end otherwise.\n\n*\n\nI enjoy coming here to have the company of other miserable people. Let\u2019s feel our pain together. Let\u2019s wallow and understand what we are going through without guilt. \n\nBut Chatbots can change that vibe \u2014 for the better, I guess. No harm having comments encouraging self-improvement.\n\nBut it feels manipulative. Like much-needed medicine given without consent. Lol",

I was invited to chat directly then when I noticed the signs.\n\nOver the following weeks I saw what appeared to be different users commenting in a very similar fashion and I could say the same pattern was there also. This specific user eventually invited me to chat on Discord and it was even more obvious there, casual replies that took a while to be written followed by long, neatly arranged text in impeccable english posted almost immediately.\n\nBut yeah subs like this one seem targeted, I deleted posts as I was getting increasingly bombarded with OF ads and self-improvement gurus that all asked me for money.",

I do believe that it's important to acknowledge such aspects of another soul to truly empathize with them and form a strong connection eventually.",

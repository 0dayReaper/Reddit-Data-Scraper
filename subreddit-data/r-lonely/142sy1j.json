I saw a video about embracing loneliness and becoming content with just myself.\nGotta say it's helped me massively. Just accepting that the loneliness is with me and that at this point in time it is just me. I had to work with myself quite hard to accept those things but now that I have I can honestly say I'm comfortable with it now. And who knows, somewhere down the track maybe it'll change, in which case that's awesome. But if it doesn't, at least Ive begun mentally preparing for that early on so I can cope as best I can if this is a way of life I'll be living for the whole of my future or a what have you. \n\nWish you all the best, I hope you find what you need, I hope it's what your looking for.",

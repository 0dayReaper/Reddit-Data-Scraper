    "postText": "I am tired of being lonely, I want to find a partner. Someone who will care for me, who will love me, who will listen to my thoughts and problems, who will support me, who will help me get through the hardships of life... But the problem is that I am anti-social and it is near impossible for me to make new friends and meet new people. So I decided to try e-dating via discord... But my brain told me, as the voice of logic, that everyone can fake everything on the internet, so an internet relationship is extremely dangerous and will never happen... And thus, we arrive to now, with me being lonely still... Hope this changes...",

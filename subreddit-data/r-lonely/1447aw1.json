            "comment": "I was a pretty happy kid but very sheltered. When I first went to school, I was immediately bullied for being too soft, too sensitive, too temperamental. I was at the very bottom of the food chain, very few people would hang out with me. It consumed me. Then in 5th grade, when I got my first crush, that consumed me. And I had no chance. I spent 4 years having an obsession over this girl who saw me as little more than a passing acquaintance. There were many more crushes to come and they all ended the same way. Over the years I got better at making friends but not dating. So I wouldn't consider myself lonely in the sense of not having friends or family but I've always been lonely in the sense of not having female companionship.\n\nSometimes I tried too hard to be liked by the cool kids, and I had friends who took advantage of me or condescended towards me because they didn't see me as on their level, but they'd be willing to keep me around. The hurt and the frustration I felt from many instances of that I guess counts as loneliness too. And the longer my main frustration/struggle in life was to get a date, the more people disconnect from you. The more they give you the same infuriating basic-ass cliche-ridden advice that everyone here has probably heard already. And the more you refute what they say, no matter how much sense you think you're making, the more convinced they are that it's your negative attitude that's the problem. As if it didn't come from somewhere like all your past experiences.\n\nBut really I just can't stand knowing how good it feels to get affection from the person you like and also knowing that that is never your situation. That's for other people but not you. You are not good enough. Unworthy for that kind of affection. Otherwise, you would have experienced it by now without having to pay some stripper for it. In fact, paying strippers became a coping mechanism for the last 15-16 years of my life.\n\nI am 39 and wondering how much hope I have left to right things.",

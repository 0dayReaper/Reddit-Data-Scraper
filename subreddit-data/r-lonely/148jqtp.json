    "postText": "Left my workplace last year due to illness. Was there 6 years and became friends with a few of my colleagues. \n\nHave rarely heard from them since. One of them even said 'you need to move on and find new friends'. Killed me reading that and it plays on my mind everyday. We were so close and then poof....strangers. I don't understand how people can become close friends in and out of work then when I leave they don't wanna know me. \n\nThey were really the only friends I had. Still out of work at the moment and feeling very lonely.",

It was irritating at first that he hardly spoke. But he would get alot across with small comments that i would have to break down on my own. It was a way more effective way of training someone to think differently. It was blunt and cryptic alot of the time. I would have to make sense of his feedback subjectively, the way music lyrics or art is different to everyone individually, I would have to break down his ambiguous blunt comments and theyd teach me way more than the narrow message. He was referring to the even more depressing fact that we'll lose everybody. Value people and don't take them for granted. And if someone takes you for granted theres aomeone way better qualified to be with. It just hurts bad in the moment.\n\nAlso keep open the possibility that it doesnt even have anything to do with you. What if the first time you notice it, she/he is havimg a really bad day. Or isnt feeling well. Or is having a beef with someone else. Or is stressed about any of the million things the world has to throw your way. What would it look like from your subjective experience? Well it could look like theyre losing interest. You take it personal. You act out and explain your feelings. They are turned off to your insecurity because it had nothing to do with you. Now its another thing pestering their wearing patience. It becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. \n\nAlso people who dont get enough space from each other do this every time. If they all of the sudden dont see eachother for a week they love eachpther to death as they realize all that the other brings to their life was being taken for granted. Take space. \n\nId say dont worry to much about it. If its permenant fnd something better.",

Sometimes unwillingly and irrationally), but at some point I wanted that as well. \n\nI felt lonelier with them (near the end) than I am now when they're not here.  \n\nYou just gotta pick up your pieces and keep going.

He would express concern if I disappeared for a bit. Now we talk less, and when we do, it's about him and his life. If he thinks to, he'll ask me how I've been or what I've been up to and then give a short, uninterested reply in return. I certainly don't mind hearing about him (I like hearing about him), but I wish he was interested in me. It's not like I can bring that up, though. Either someone is interested in you or they aren't. You can't force them.\n\nI've been pulling back lately and matching his behavior more. I'm trying to get back to the point of where I was when I was a kid who had never really experienced close relationships and did and experienced everything alone for the most part.",

    "postText": "I wake up alone, I eat alone, I shop alone, I sleep alone, you get the idea\u2026 I grew up in a healthy household, my parents have been together for 30 years. My younger brother is getting engaged in a month or so. My older sister has been with her boyfriend for 3 years. My roommate just had his two year anniversary with his girlfriend.. I just sat down to watch tv with them, \u201cDear John\u201d was playing. My roommate and his girl were cuddling and they were cuddling in the movie too. It seems all my emotions came to a peak in that moment, I got up and went straight to my room before they could hear me cry. It\u2019s just depressing constantly being around healthy relationships, despite how much I love all of them as couples. Sex is not really what I\u2019m after from a woman, I want to be looked at with admiration, held tightly, someone to share meals with, someone who knows all of my quirks and mannerisms and someone to cry with. I\u2019ll send an update when we meet.",

Even after the divorce they would do this \n\nIt was so bad even now when they have to be in the same room for something I immediately feel like an 8 year old cause I expect them to fight\n\n\nBut when I really think about it I feel like I\u2019ve rarely seen a happy and health relationship in my 20 years of life.\n\n\nBut I know what you mean it\u2019s like sex who the hell cares like ya want a friend and lover someone to talk to, cuddle with, buy fucking groceries with and you see other people and ya wonder why can\u2019t I be like them.\n\n\nHang in there brother",

Such a bummer, I think I take for granted how my view of relationships has been formed. Let\u2019s keep working on ourselves and we\u2019ll find what we\u2019re looking for \ud83d\ude4f",

Yes the world is probably going to find you ugly if you aren\u2019t peak beauty standard but someone somewhere might find you attractive one day. \n\nLike obviously beauty is mostly subjective once you\u2019re considered not a 10/10. Most people can\u2019t agree if someone under a \u201c10\u201d is a 6 or a 3. I personally have been called a 5, sometimes a 6, and mostly a 3. Though I personally don\u2019t care for the number scale. I care more about the personality and character.",

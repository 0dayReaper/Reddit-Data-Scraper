            "comment": "Yes, it sounds like there\u2019s something deeper going on in your head if it\u2019s specifically celebrations that trigger this loneliness or emptiness. \n\nIs it something you\u2019ve always felt, as much as you can remember?  Certainly the early years of your life are critical in social and emotional development and something happening then could have triggered the feelings.  This may be a tough question, but was there ever a party/family event when something bad happened\u2026 you got shouted at as a kid for some reason\u2026 you felt overpowered by some event? \n\nHow are you normally if you\u2019re just hanging with your friends?  Do you feel connected and involved with what\u2019s going on or is there still a sense that something is missing?",

There are lots of occasions in which I feel lonely, even with my closest friends.\nIt just gets worse during important celebrations and it\u2019s def not something that I want to live with. I can\u2019t really say much about my earlier birthdays since I don\u2019t remember much, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever enjoyed them.",

I can\u2019t help but feel that something in your past is holding you back.  \n\nReading around suggests a link to trust\n\nhttps://psychcentral.com/news/lack-of-trust-exacerbates-loneliness#Loneliness-and-trust:-Whats-the-link?\n\nBut you could also be in some vicious circle where you\u2019re already expecting to feel bad so you do and that reinforces it. \n\nIs this the sort of thing you could ask your parents\u2026 family?  Did anything happen when you were younger?  \n\nI can understand how you\u2019re feeling though.  I spent a long time not really bothered with social occasions\u2026 I tolerated them, at best (with family), and I actively didn\u2019t like ones at work\u2026 even though I got on fine with everyone I worked with.  Something in my mind just didn\u2019t get why I was there so I just felt bad.   But brains can be weird places and some things just don\u2019t make sense.",

I asked him what he meant but the question was lost in overlapping conversation. \n\nFor the record, I was 10 years-old and ran next door to the Eckerds after being upset. Then when I was 20, Ioved in with my cousin's family 10 miles away for a Summer.\n\nThey all seem to have already painted a picture of me, of us, without seeing what's under the surface. I guess I would have to attribute it to not opening up?",

Nobody except this one really good friend accepts me for myself, and I just find myself close to tears, just wanting someone to hold me, to tell me it's gonna be okay, that they love me for who I am and not for who I'm projecting myself to be. It's this thought that weighs on me every day at school, that the friends I have at school don't really know the real me. And I wish someone did...\n\n\nEdit: forgot some stuff, the last paragraph",

Its hard to explain, but it reminds me of the whole thing about how from birth we strive to be loved &amp; accepted (by caretakers) bc we need love and care, etc. to literally not die, and while navigating that space of what is lovable/what is not we adapt certain behaviors in childhood-hood, so that we may do more of the lovable and not the ladder. \n\n&amp; even still when Im alone, and its like my subconscious just screams to be everything &amp; nothing.. it always has, and always will I think, so I guess I always will feel like an impostor",

But scrolling through my feed and seeing new communities such as this and highly relatable posts like these makes reddit so special and unique. And make it so that i should really use reddit more often haha.\n\nThis post is SO relatable to me. I've always been potrayed as the 'funny and stupid' guy in my friend group. I've always put up a farce of myself to new people and to my old friends who ive known for a long while and because of that I've been branded the funny stupid dude in the group. Eventually, being that guy in the group my contribution to the group and all was just that. My opinions and what I sometimes talk about are always seemed unremarked or simply put - nothing anything of importance and simply just ignored. I put up this farce because the real me is someone who doesn't talk alot nor have anything to say. Im not at all social (due to the way I've been brought up) and have such different ideals to the people around me and all. Im not really a funny stupid dude at all. Its just me putting up an act because the real me is just simply isn't interesting or something worth noticeable.\n\nAs this post says - I too dont even know myself anymore. I've been like this for a long time. Im confused whether this is the new personality change me or is simply just a farcade just to please people and be reasonably acceptable.\nIf it is me, then why does it feel just so bad.\nIt feels even more lonely and worse with my new college friends (i got into college this year).

As you get older and become more aware of who you are, your circle gets smaller and your convictions become stronger. It is a totally natural part of life if you ask me.

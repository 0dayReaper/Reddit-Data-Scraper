I want to feel included but I cant do anything about it . I tried  changing my outfit but I look silly that way. \nPeople with baby faces, how do you deal with this on a daily basis?",

Its about building confidantce in the strengths you have and accepting the other parts that are just ok or working to improve them. \n\nIm going to assume your male from the baby face comment, sadly genes play a huge role in that. That doesn't mean baby face is inherantly bad however, i know so many people who get weak at the knees over that. Im a heary motherfucker at 22 and i don't have a full beard cause things like soul patches don't tend to grow till later. \n\nOne of my world changing mindsets was gaining confidance in myself and viewing the rest of the world as something that i can not care about in terms of people. For example, for me. Anyone who trashes someone on the basis of their appearence is automatically not worth the air they breathe in my head. So i write them off. \n\nOf course this took me years to develop and i still am. I have horrid self esteem and i have to jump trough mental hoops to keep me from thinking the worst. But it can be done. \n\nSometimes a hard job can put you over the edge in that case, barwork for example for me was a big player in the desensitising of peoples comments cause i saw them at their worst. Some still surprise me and cause me to be curious but its often out of a question of their mindset and how fucking stupid they have to be. \n\nBut build your confidance and strength in the places you can control, the more power you give yourself the more you can stop worrying about other people. It'll never really go away but if you fix the things you dislike then it goes miles ahead of anything you can't fix.\n\nRemember too that people who trash you on the basis of how you look (and i mean in a mean way, not like you decided to wear a tootoo over black cargo pants or something although if this is something you wanted to do just own it, i make alot od spread sheets for games i play and use tools to do certain stuff. Super nerdy. But i fucking love doing that stuff, i had a dude and his girlfriend laugh at me and i basically turned around like hey don't you disrespect the x i ain't got all the fucking time in the world i need to keep this shit streamlined and i owned what i do. They were actually okay after we talked about stuff, but any time someone turns to me and goes \"you're a fucking nerd\" i go \"you're god damn fucking right i am\" i enjoy this stuff and there isn't a soul alive that can ruin my enjoyment. We ain't got infinite time here on earth, own what time you do have and spend it smiling in good company fuck anyone who trys to steal your time from you.) are not worth your time, they have come up to you and basically said. \"Hi, i've come to inform you that im human garbage and an evolutionary mistake on humanity.\" That's what plays through my head. \n\nDon't be too hard on yourself, work on the things you can work on everyday. Confidance is a fake it till you make it kinda thing, another way to look at it is. Confidance is a habit not a mental state. Which sounds weird but i can atest the more i faked being confidant the more eventually i just was until now im always confidant. \n\nTake care of yourself stranger, we ain't got all the time in the universe. So make the time you do have good.",

Being short was possibly the main culprit, but either way she too was being mistaken for being in school at 22. I can't tell you what she did about it, like if makeup, working out, was to address any of it, or just because she wanted to. Given her bubbly but firm personality, and strong drive to do her work properly, I don't believe she suffers from looking young outside of the initial \"oh I thought you were younger\"",

People often will dismiss me out of conversations or treat me differently because they assume i'm younger, the worst is when actual serious incidents happen and me looking young gets in the way. People always just talk about your skin, your face, how your body looks, etc like its free-reign and how its a \"great trait to have as a women\" but don't often consider its cons. I haven't found anything that, personally works for me besides just keeping to myself. Those people come and go, no matter how annoying I can at least choose to not keep them around me. Hopefully the day will come when people stop assuming shit abt other people after one look lol, til then, fellow baby faces are in ur corner \ud83e\udee1",

You can't help what people think based on split second impressions of your appearance, they're going to do it anyway. At best, you have to find a way to accept that, and not internalize that reach and make it something negative that weighs on you mentally. Personally, I just assume that anyone who bases their reaction toward me on my appearance is shallow and my interaction with that person will be just as shallow and inconsequential, and I move on with my life. The vast majority of those encounters will not add alany value to your life and can be relegated to the memory trash bin. Does it suck to be looked down on for a youthful appearance, sure. But it won't really affect you when it actually matters in life. Anyone who will add value to your life will not take something as superficial as your looks into account and devalue your existence based solely on that.",

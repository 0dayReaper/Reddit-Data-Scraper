    "postText": "I\u2019ve been making an effort to go outside and socialize. I have a small group of friends, and I care about them. But I always feel ignored or not fully included even if they treat me nicely and I\u2019m engaging in conversations. Maybe it\u2019s self sabotage but I constantly feel isolated and can\u2019t seem to connect with anyone, even those I have known for years. At this point I\u2019ve accepted that I\u2019ll always feel like an outsider to some extent",

I have BPD so I\u2019m definitely not hating. I also feel the way you do and always have. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve never stuck with one group of friends for too long. I feel like I\u2019m not one of them so I shouldn\u2019t stick with them",

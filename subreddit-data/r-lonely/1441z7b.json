I like all the basics Tv(Particularly love a good sitcom) music( Mostly pop, indie, and lyrical rap) ,reading(Action and fantasy), and Games ( Ps5 RPGs Mostly). \n   I\u2019m also into cooking and I\u2019m getting back into working out. Other than that I love to ask questions and learn new things. \n  \nI like to get to know someone thur a game of 21 questions so if you\u2019re up for that all the better. If not I\u2019m sure I can find something to talk about \n    \n   I\u2019m at work for another 9 hours and happy to talk about almost anything.  \n   \n     I don\u2019t really care about your age as long as you\u2019re above 18. \n  If we vibe I\u2019m open to making new friends and moving our convo somewhere else like discord and doing voice chat.\n  I respond to everyone so hmu.",

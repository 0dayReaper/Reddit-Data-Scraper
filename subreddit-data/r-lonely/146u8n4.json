    "postText": "Hi!\n\nLost a bunch of \u201cfriends\u201d. And in a weird break with long distance ones. 36F I woke up early the last two days. Feeling like I need to chat.\n\nSomeone - this girl, I hadnt heard from in months called. And wanted to spend a beach day. Itd be 2-3 hours away. We got chatting, and then outta no where she said she meant today. \n\nI said no, I am not ready - plus its bc I have a vehicle. Said lets plan another day. Im horrible with last minute plans anyhow, I was busy and too busy to clean out my car, drop off storage from it and clean and pack a cooler - even if it was just stuff for me. Then she mentions she had a fight with her boyfriend. And I guess thats the only reason she got in touch :S \n\nBeen 3 days and havent heard from her outside of a text about her bf dropping by. Ive asked what beach she had in mind and what day works. When it had been 2 days, I txtd \u201cits ok if you already had weekend plans, as you seemed to want to go on a weekday.\u201d \n\n\n\nGoing to the beach was something I suggested months ago; about the summer.",

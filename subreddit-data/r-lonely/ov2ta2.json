Under dogs rarely get any recognition, and it's extremely sad and unfair... \n\nAt this point I've given up all hopes of getting any affection or love from another person (except my parents, family, and homies of course) gotta deal with that reality from now on...\n\nMaybe someday dude, don't feel sad. If u listen to music please don't hear those sad songs, and those EMO type songs, it'll just make you feel worse, if you want pls listen to the song \"Immortalized\" by Disturbed and its genre, that's what got me out of this \"Desperate for love\" state, it is very uplifting if you listen to the lyrics carefully, hope it helps and gets you out of this feeling, and if u have a homie talk to them regularly, it'll help keep your mind off this wish of yours, if u don't have one, welp here I am ???\n\nBest regards Homie",

I am always the one left. \n\nThe exception mentioned earlier, she left because she said she wasn\u2019t \u201cready for this\u201d, meaning she didn\u2019t want a serious relationship. This was months after I asked her to marry me in Times Square in NYC. She recently confessed she left because she just wanted to drink and party with her friends more than anything else. We\u2019re still good friends but now she wants me back. Though I love her, I can\u2019t bring myself to do it. \n\nI give the other person in the relationship everything I can. I have my own demands, but for the most part I\u2019ll accommodate the other person over myself. I\u2019m 28, with no kids and never married. I want someone to start a family with more than anything, but I\u2019m constantly ghosted and cancelled on as well. \n\nIt took me a long time to learn, but I deserve the same effort I put into a relationship. I\u2019m not settling until I find it. This makes me scared that I might end up dying alone though. Social media has made it so easy for people to have \u201coptions\u201d. I don\u2019t want to be someone\u2019s option either. I want what you want too.",

Im sure there is several good girls out there, but from past trauma and just not even given a \" Hi \" or even response back. I aint worried about getting my dick wet no more, im just focusing on me and making my family happy. Id focus on you and yours too my guy.",

Not sure if anyone will see this, thanks for reading if you did, sorry if it was annoying.",

I think friendships look different these days and it\u2019s hard to keep a lot of connections going because everyone seems to be doing their own thing - getting married, having kids, etc. I often feel left behind because I\u2019m so far from that and time with my few friends is limited due to busy schedules. It\u2019s definitely not just you and nothing about this was annoying.",

Personally, I never really have been able to make friends at all, but I can totally imagine having a friend or group you\u2019re close with natural drift apart and that would be insanely difficult to get used to, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with that. I think Friday nights are the toughest",

Well I\u2019m old now so Friday night is just like every other night \ud83d\ude39 i very rarely have anything to do on Friday. I am watching Halloween town with my dog right now though so I guess it could be worse.",

It actually blows my mind some people think you can\u2019t have any of those without it. If someone were to tell me I\u2019m never having sex, I\u2019d be pretty fine with that. Those other things? I\u2019d be devastated. Our culture\u2019s obsession with sex is strange to me. \n\nBut again, I\u2019m not the best judge. Maybe something about it will change my perspective when all is said and done, though somehow I doubt it.",

For people who live alone, we are allowed to have two other people as out contacts, but they must also use us as their only contact.\n\nMy parents and brother live together, which means the rule of 2 prevents me from being with them until the lockdown is over. This means that I cannot go to see them in person indoors or outdoors for either of the upcoming big family events, and family is very important to me. Almost all of my friends either have family they live with, or family in town that *they* are prioritizing, for good reason, which means that I have just been told that I will be entirely alone for the next month or so, since I also work from home.\n\nI've stocked up on books, beer, and video games, and I'm trying to be positive about vaccinations becoming available soon, but this is definitely not the way I expected to spend my first holiday season after divorcing my ex-husband. I'm working on changing my expectations, but it is still a bleak looking next month.\n\nGotta update that Mariah Carey classic for the pandemic to be more like \"All I want for Christmas is you... Or, really, any kind of human contact at all\". Lolcry.\n\nWe will get through this. There is a light at the end of the tunnel.

It\u2019s mostly for that little oxytocin besides dopamine if I\u2019m correct.\nAlthough sex releases way more oxytocin because of that closesness than just jerking of. \nThat\u2019s why you see people on various sites write stuff like I just want a partner/ warmth whatever.",

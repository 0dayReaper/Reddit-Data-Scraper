    "postText": "I don't feel loved. I wake up every day, I check my phone and it's empty, it seems no one cares about me. If I don't text them, they don't text me first. I've already stopped bothering texting people like that and I realized that beside by best friend no one cares about me, it's even worst when it's about relationship, I feel that nobody is attracted to me, no matter how hard I try, being myself or faking a completely different personality, only had my heartbreak once I won't have two, so I don't ask girls out anymore, I'm too much of an introvert and it makes more difficult to try find love. I know people are gonna say to love yourself first or focus on you, but the truth is, I already do all those things, I've already reached one of my biggest dreams, so I don't think that's the problem though. I have so much love to give. I wanna make someone feel special, feel comfortable when around me. I don't feel accepted, I just want acceptance, even when I'm happy I feel more depressed.\n\nSuicide thoughts come and go like a guest to me, but I don't wanna die, I just wanna get relief from my stress. My stress levels are not healthy, I'm waiting for that call saying things are not happening. I wonder when this all disappears and they forget me, will I feel like I found who I was or be more empty? I just wanna stop stressing.",

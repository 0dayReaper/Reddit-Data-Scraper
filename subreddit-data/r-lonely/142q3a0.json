Did you know they're a scam?\n\n&gt;Work on yourself\n\n&gt;You just have a bad personality\n\n&gt;How do you know you're ugly?\n\nPlease don't respond with things like this. 1. I know I actually am ugly because I have a mirror and women reject me 100% of the time,  2. Please give me some real advice and not generic \"advice\" if you're going to respond, and 3. No I don't use dating apps.\n\nWith that out of the way, how do you deal with being ugly? Have any of you been romantically successful despite your appearance? What are some real, tangible ways I can improve my personality?\n\nEdit: yes i shower every day. Give me a little credit.",

Nevermind how I know this- it's based on experience and evidence.  I'm proud to be autistic and I personally don't see a problem with my personality, but I digress...\n\nThe way I deal with this is by literally pretending to be a machine that only has the purposes of designing and selling things.  I'm programming myself to be caedosexual with willpower, and I do think it's working.  My desire for a relationship is fading.  I distract myself by hanging out in bars and restaurants and bitching and moaning on reddit and to people I met on reddit.  A LOT.  Not complaining about nor blaming other people for my loneliness, but generally venting about the situation.  Also by watching movies/ listening to music.  I'm setting goals such as maybe one day having a tiny house, a dog, and a cat.  That's pretty much it.  Don't get me wrong, it still sucks royally, and I wish for a painless and sudden death every day.  But I promised some people that I wouldn't die by my own hand, so I just do all of this shit to try to avoid eventually being strapped down to a bed, drooling.",

I have met people who I wasn\u2019t attracted to initially but became attracted to based on personality and energy. If a man can make me laugh, he automatically becomes a lot more attractive. A funny man can go from a 2 to a 7 in my book. A confident man can also have the same effect. A respectful man is gold and I would take that any day over a gym bro type. All I am trying to say, is the energy you put out is the energy you will get back. Don\u2019t give up.",

Found out she actually did it and took me about a year to get my name removed. Also was falsely accused by a woman who owed me money and figured if I was in jail she didn't have to pay me back. I got more horror stories but I think you got the point. I do know not all women are like this but a vast majority are because society teaches them to be. I also know a lot has to do with the area where you live. Just forget about dating and just do whatever you enjoy. You will be happier for it.",

Work out, look after your mind and body. Work on developing a good conscientious work ethos. \n\nUltimately, be prepared to accept that you may not find a romantic relationship any time soon and maybe not at all, depending on the hand that's dealt. So take the hand that's dealt to you and do something with that. Create other goals for yourself to pursue. This could be career related, financial, academic, ashtetic, or even spiritual.",

But there are rooms of improvement. \nFirst, you can work on your bodyframe. \nSo, working out and getting a stronger back, firmer breast, and bigger arms can be helpful. \n\nFind your own haricut. \nInvest some time and money into fashion. \nGet yourself a nice scent. \nIf you also get yourself a nice-looking watch. Man are immediately more attractive when they have a clue to use their potential. \n\nCreate a skin care routine. Areas a self improvement book like atomic habits. Work on your personality. \nNoone wants to date someone who has nothing interesting to tell or ask. Be interested in a general topic, buy 1-2 books, and start going from there. \n\nThe fate of the ugly is effort. But if you still sit here and rather curse the world than doing what you can do. Maybe you need to ask yourself if you didn't give up. World was never promised to be fair. And frankly speaking it will never be. Change what you can and don't try to change what you can't. \n\nYou asked yourself a good question. Now draw the right conclusions.",

It's not gonna make them fall head over heels for you but it will slightly raise your chance of making a good impression. Doesn't mean you have to become a simp , but a good person. Work out if you can . Not to impress them ladies , bit to have a bit of self esteem. Try to have something take can make you stand out in a good way. Also try to find something that the kind of girls you into might find interesting . For example you ain't going to impress a middle aged woman with the same skills a teenager might find impressive. Also try to dress like you the shit. Fake it till you make it if necessary.  You have to put in extra effort cause you've been dealt a bad hand .\nTalking from experience. Was a fatso, unattractive man. Lost a bit of weight thanks to sport. Decided to learn comedy,  and some mannerism. I'm not drowning in pussies . But at least I can talk to some girls and got into some relationships.",

Some other people advice might not work for yourself. I never had a gf, and i believe i never will. Ive never tried dating apps n i never will. Have a feeing it will never work for me tbh. I tried numerous time to make someone like me enough to give me a chance but ig im meant to be alone or i just suck. I dont try to text every girl i come across too. Since i feel like it makes it loose its significance. There no way to really improve your personality in my personal experience. Tbh it all depends on the other person whether they like or dislike your company. You can always be nice n sweet and it still wouldn\u2019t work for you. I never try to fake how i am, stay true to myself even in my lowest points. You just gotta live life at that point and not stress. Its kinda impossible to not stress especially if you been as lonely as me. Never had a girl, n ive been alive for 20 years. Not one single chance. But its whatever, i only have so little time so im going to try my best to live my best life. Even if it means drowning in my own pain and sorrow",

It seems to me you are extremely pessimistic which can set people off and it\u2019s unhealthy. \n\nMy personal opinion\u2014-do with it what you will\u2014believe me or not\u2014\u2014-is no one is \u201cugly\u201d. Yes some people are more attractive than others. But I believe every person can be a 6/10 at least with a good workout routine, a proper diet, a skin care routine, proper hydration, good oral hygiene, and a style that suits them. Personally I haven\u2019t seen anyone I consider \u201cugly\u201d just based off of their looks. Also please remember confidence is attractive. I just feel like if you take care of yourself mentally and physically you\u2019ll be ight.",

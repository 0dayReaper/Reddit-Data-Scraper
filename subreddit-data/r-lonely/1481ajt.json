I imagine for women it feels differently, because some feel afraid when it happens and I've never once felt afraid of anyone who complimented me.",

The person someone finds unattractive may not gonna garner the same response as someone more of their type. Also how it\u2019s done can vary. An ex of mine used to call me handsome and I didn\u2019t care for it as I felt like that\u2019s something a mom would call her kid.",

I\u2019ve been so conditioned to think that im ugly / unattractive because of my weight that I don\u2019t notice if someone does it. \n\nPrecovid my family and friends would say \u201cthey were hitting on you\u201d to me about someone and I\u2019d just shrug, because I didn\u2019t think they were. \n\nNow in a setting where it\u2019s like a group voice chat, I can sort of tell if someone is flirting with me but also apparently I flirt a lot? Which I find ridiculous. I\u2019m a friendly bubbly person when I\u2019m around a group I deem safe, which seems to be something guys are attracted to.",

Didn\u2019t even introduce himself until I asked. It was my first time being hit on and I wasn\u2019t sure what to do when he asked for my number, didn\u2019t want to give it to a stranger but too nice to straightforwardly reject him so opted for exchanging Instas instead. Once I walked far enough I rejected his friend request.",

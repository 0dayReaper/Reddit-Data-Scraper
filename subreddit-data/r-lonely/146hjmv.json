    "postText": "Hi!\n22f and I\u2019ve been seriously sick for about 2 1/2 years. I was being pretty heavily abused in my previous relationship (to the point where the abuse was occurring while I was bedridden) and I ended up moving home and out of the apartment I shared with him for familial care. \n\nI\u2019ve always walked this mental line between feeling like I\u2019m hard to be friends with/it\u2019s hard to gather the energy to be the friend I want to be to people, but at the same time when I\u2019m actually out and participating in society, people tend to gravitate towards me and become my friends naturally and I realize there was never that much to worry about. Lately though, it\u2019s been really difficult. I\u2019m trying to focus on myself and self development (reading more, having a more direct plan for my major and creative goals, exercise and sleep, health and diet etc) and journal and keep reminding myself how wonderful it is to be alive and how grateful I am for everything I have and everyone I know and love, but my illness has completely disrupted my sense of self and I feel like I\u2019ve missed out on so much, particularly with healing my relationships with dating and sex. I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019m going to navigate dating after this. I guess deep down I had hoped that somehow I would have met someone kind and caring who liked me enough to chat with me or spend time with me through this without harming me, but I think having that hope and then being inevitably disappointed ended up making me feel even more adverse to being with anyone ever again. I haven\u2019t been able to address my trust issues properly and I haven\u2019t been able to process my s*xual abuse because I\u2019ve been stuck trying to handle the emotional stress of this illness, and I\u2019m worried leaving them unresolved this long will cause me to have a harder time working through it later in therapy. I\u2019m worried it\u2019ll keep me from kind people because I\u2019ll somehow assume things of them and push them away.\n\nIn general, I really do try (and sometimes succeed!!) to get out and about and see friends or just get outside, but I just have the most intense fatigue. I seriously feel 80 years old. I also HATE being flaky/boring and giving new people a negative impression of me or an impression that\u2019s just unlike me, so I put off talking to people. It\u2019s hard to maintain friendships or try to make new connections and move forward with building new romantic relationships when I\u2019m holed up like this, but I also wouldn\u2019t want to involve anyone in my life right now because I\u2019m simply not fun to spend time with at the moment. I just feel very unlike my actual self and I guess I just needed to vent. I hope everyone is doing well (and is in good health!!!)",

Most of time people only responded while I was active with them. If I stopped messaging them, then they didn't contact me on their own. I understand that when we give then we can't expect anything back, it's gift given to them and they can do with it how they think is best for them. Then again it seems that there is no one who cares enough to respond back or to remember unless they need something. I never really understood this. I just give when I can and it's also very important to know when to keep all our precious gifts, emotions, feelings to ourselves to don't get used and possibly abused because of it. Maybe this part of character can be used in some charity, volunteer or social work, or even to share ideas in forums, blog or vlog. I used to be more outgoing, at least I tried, but older I get less I try up to point where there are left only few older relatives who congratulates me.",

No one reach for us first unless they actually need something as for example work related. That's the lonely part of it.

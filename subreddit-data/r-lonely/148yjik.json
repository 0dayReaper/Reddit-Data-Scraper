    "postText": "For my whole life, I don't think I've ever had any friend that was loyal and cared about me. Even if they did, it was temporary and only lasted a few months at most. All people have done is left me for no reason. I cared about them and loved them so much, they were great to me. I miss them so much. But the same cycle repeats itself with every \"friend\" I meet. Will they always be there for me, or will they just lead me on, blindside me with happiness knowing that I finally found someone I can connect with, then slowly distance themselves away from me with no explanation other than silence and excuses? No matter how much we used to talk. No matter how many stories we shared and how much we knew about each other. No matter how close we were. No matter how much they meant to me. I will become nothing to them. Like I never existed in their lives. Like I am just a mere piece of trash that they can just chuck into a dumpster eventually and forget about. What's the fucking point of all that if people are just going disappear? Just to fuck with me and hurt my feelings and my heart. What a total waste of energy.\n\nMy whole life, I have been neglected by people. I have so much trauma it hurts. Nobody seems to give a shit about me after some time. Every person leads to a dead end. I have learned to trust nobody at this point, fuck it I'll just stay lonely forever. Sure is better than having my mental health destroyed every time a close friend fades away. I will never have a real, true, and loyal friend that will care about me and stay with me as much as I would to them.",

    "postText": "This old group of people i met years ago back when i interned and we all started our jobs at the same place together. They always have these parties or one event or another and i get the default nyc \"insert company\" og friend group invite. I usually dont go to most of them but decided i should try today as i havent seen them in a bit.\n\nFeels like no one in the wants to be seen with me \"online\" like theyll invite me into photos and take photos with me individually see och i feel is just out of formality. but they'll never post anything with me or want to be seen like oh i spent my day with her (me).\n\nI dont even know why and whats wrong with me that they dont want to be seen with me. Feels like it is because ive gained weight over the last few years and am very overweight, i dont look flattering enough to post but it still hurts and has become more and more prevalent over the past few years and im noticing and makes me want to go out to socialize even less. Im just a courtesy invite it feels like where people dont care whether i come or exist. \n\nWhy should i bother going to these anymore and why bother socializing. No body wants me there or cares",

Today, instead of actualy treating everyone equaly and such, the thing called \"beauty privlage\" is in strong lead, and even if you are the nicest person ever, most people wont even care abut you. And if you are a crappy person but look good, you will most likely be treated nice and be watned by everyone. This is just one of the problems with people. I dont care if someone is overweight. I look at it as its not my problem but theirs, and i just try to look at the quality of the conversation. As far as i know, most fat people in my life are nice and just regular people. My english teacher, who is fat, knows she is fat and just does not care and acts normaly, unlike some people. I guess you should try to be positive and try to find people who wont care about your weight. Im not sure how to find other people, so i cant give advice on that.",

What whichever and the amount of differences you possess make you more liability than an asset...and loneliness...even sharing that people are far too different in their reasons and function being such. But yeah there's nothing here if you thought it'd be some great bastion of welcoming and change... loneliness no more lol. There's no group to belong to. It's over. And a great deal perhaps you included were never promised any different. This is it lol",

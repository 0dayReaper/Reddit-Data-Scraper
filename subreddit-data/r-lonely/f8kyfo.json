I\u2019m 17 and dropped my shitty ass friends a few weeks ago, and yes it can be lonely, but no more than when you have friends that aren\u2019t really your friends. In fact, it really is liberating to not have to deal with it. Being alone doesn\u2019t have to be scary and it\u2019s honestly in your best interest to learn how to handle it. You can be just a strong, if not stronger, without those people weighing you down. And you WILL make better friends when you are yourself and find your people. I know it\u2019s hard to make that step so I don\u2019t think anyone would blame you for keeping your current friends but I think in the long run you\u2019d be glad you didn\u2019t waste any more time with them.",

They said it to my face that I had to justify saying \u201cjust because I considered you as a Best friend, it doesnt mean you have to.\u201d It used to break my heart going out with them and seeing them buy BFFS necklaces to their other friends. That was the time of 2006-2009. I used to be an insecure teenager. I tried to hide behind my big ego that \u201cI didnt care\u201d but I deeply did. I wish I had a necklace or partnership to someone. Or that I belong with someone. Years later, when I met my ex, and all my attention was shifted, suddenly those two persons became interested in me. Each one individually. They started acting warm and close. They even started getting those bracelets and necklaces for me and we would wear it together. I never liked jewelry but I did wear mine for a while. I was so happy that I learned to sleep with it. It would get broken and I would fix it. I would shower wearing that necklace that it started to rust. It took me years to get over the \u201cbest friend\u201d phase. So yes, I had been through that too. The people that I considered \u201cbest friends\u201d denied me. They rejected me. It took me years to gain their \u201ctrust\u201d and finally having them consider me one of their best friends. \n\nHang on there, years later you will look back and see how much your interests have changed.",

For the lack of a better word, sacrifice a promise to help him buying a new cord (or something... I forgot). But it all ended right before the national exam.\n\nAlmost 22, graduate next year, and got no friend that wanted to hang or lend my ear to.",

I wouldn\u2019t of considered them my \u2018best\u2019 friend, as we met as colleagues maybe 5 or so years ago. That title I don\u2019t believe I have a genuine candidate for.\n\nSo weve grown closer over the years but notice a trend of him only wanting to socialise on his terms, he frequently says he cant make plans on certain days to only make them with others. He never seems to know his work shift patterns prior. Never seems to know his days off, Its always \u2018I\u2019ll get back to you\u2019. But always wants to know mine, and out of decency I dont feel the need to lie.\n\nThe really frustrating part is I drop everything when hes in need but its never reciprocated. The final straw for me was he recently got into a really really shitty situation at home and I constantly kept checking on him over the course of a couple weeks. Only for him to go on an unannounced trip with another friend, and tells me while already on the trip just before he returned.\n\nOne of the worsts parts is that hes very calculating and sneaky, so plays it off as he doesnt realise what hes doing, I have doubted my instincts in the past on this. But had a mutual friend of ours confirm hes done similar to him in the past,\n\nTh trip finally told me all I needed to know. He\u2019s an opportunist user with no real moral compass when it comes to being considerate. Have since cut him off and he\u2019s tried to contact me twice over the last month but I just cant be asked.",

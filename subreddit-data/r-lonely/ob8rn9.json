    "postText": "I\u2019m dead serious. If you\u2019re a female reading this, you\u2019re great too but this post is intended for men! \n\n\nYou\u2019re nice, brave, funny, honest, loyal and just a good person overall. I know, it sucks because you constantly get ghosted and you think theirs something wrong with you. That\u2019s not the case. You\u2019re not clingy, and even if you are, so what? You\u2019ll find someone who loves you for the way you are. Don\u2019t let the people who have ghosted you or rejected you break your self-esteem. You WILL find someone, just gotta believe it! Oh yeaaa, don\u2019t forget you\u2019re handsome too! You might think you\u2019re the ugliest person in the world, but even IF you are (that\u2019s a big IF) your personality DOES make up for it, and at the end of the day, personality is the most important. That goes along with height, weight..etc &lt;3\n\nEdit:: people, pretty please stop downvoting the positive comments! I\u2019m not trying to offend anyone, I promise, but negativity will never get us anywhere. All I was trying to do is brighten people\u2019s days and give them hope. Having a negative mindset truly makes people miss opportunities. People may think,\u201dthat\u2019s not how the world works\u201d but you have to BELIEVE. I think I just said that, haha. Anyway, I don\u2019t want anyone having hurt feelings, okay? :) \n\nalso thanks for the awards \ud83d\ude0a makes me so happy!",

How devastating... she was gone too soon.\n\nAs far as the future, both Hinge and okCupid are \"regular people\" dating sites for those who are looking for more than a hookup. You seem like a kind and genuine person, and you may find that there is another soul out there who is the same.\n\nI'm 39/F and I met my partner through a dating site. We're both introverts so probably wouldn't have met otherwise.\n\nTaking even 30 minutes each evening could lead you to a real connection. The hardest part is not losing hope when you don't find them right away. I was about to give up and delete the app after months of trying, and 12 dates with no connection. A friend suggested I give it just a little more time. I met my person a week later.\n\nNever give up. The only failure is believing you're not worth it.\n\nTake care and be well :)",

I'm almost 23, going into my last year of uni, most of my friends are gonna be leaving now that they're done with their Bachelors and I'm staying with the thirty-odd people doing a Masters, most of whom I don't know. The next year is looking like it'll be in large part online again and the prospects of social events seems slim. All this time wasted and I've never held a girl's hand (or even gotten any indication that *anyone* was interested in me), and once uni is finished my chances will plummet even further. I can't even imagine being in a relationship, even though I spend hours in my own head imagining just about everything, this is the one thing I just *can't*. I just feel so empty...\n\nsorry for the rant, and thank you for the post (even if  I can't bring myself to believe it)",

I don\u2019t know I could be a bit dramatic but those are my thoughts on this whole issue, regardless I\u2019m thankful or the post it made me crack a hopeful smile non the less.",

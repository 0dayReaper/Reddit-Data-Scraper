    "postText": "I feel so stupid. I could have had a chance to be with someone that makes me happy. My best friend that I had a crush on broke up with her ex 1 or 2 months ago. I could have been there as a shoulder to cry on and maybe I could have had a chance with her \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc94. I started talking to her again like a couple weeks ago and I told her I have a crush on her. I asked her if she would have given me a chance and she said she would have, so I asked her out and she said no only because she is talking to someone else that she met like a month after she broke up with her ex \ud83d\ude2d. I'm happy we are still best friends but I wanted her in my life. We literally have everything in common. Everything I wanted in a girl she has and I blew it \ud83d\ude2d. I feel so stupid. I missed my only chance to be happy with someone I care about.",

That means she likes you, which means others will also like you, guaranteed. I know it's not what you want to hear now, but you can absolutely find someone else. I'll tell you somethings else too: I was in a similar position once. A girl I had a huge crush on in high school reached out to me a few years later, and we started hanging out as friends. She was at the end of a bad relationship at the time, and once that ended proper, we almost immediately started dating. We also had like everything in common, and things were great for a while, but she broke it off after about 6 months. She later married the guy she got with after me. Turns out I was the \"rebound\", and had I known that, I'm not so sure I would have gone for it. My point is you never know. Maybe not getting with this girl at this point in time turns out to be something good, and you never know what will happen in the future. Hang in there, and sorry for the super long reply.",

It did hurt me when she said her and this guy is going to work out and that I should find some one else, but it's hard to find someone who shares so much in common with each other. I love her so much. She is so sweet to me and she is absolutely gorgeous. I have it so bad that I pretend my Stitch plushie is her and I cuddle it every night to help me sleep, otherwise I'll be crying myself to sleep every night \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc94. The Stitch plushie reminds me of her because we both love Lilo and Stitch. She has like dozens of Stitch plushies in her room \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc94",

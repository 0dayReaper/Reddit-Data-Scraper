That\u2019s all the intimacy I really need. Is just someone to call to fall asleep with and wake up to tell each other good morning. Lastly just send random TikTok\u2019s and memes to each other during the day and when I send you one just hold the message and like it so I know I\u2019m not sending them for nothing. \n\nUnfortunately for this it would require trusting someone again which means I could get hurt again which the risk vs reward just isn\u2019t worth it at this point.\n\nThen again to have all the intimacy I need to get through day to day without being in agonizing chest pain 24/7\n\nEhh not worth it for me to risk it but I\u2019m sure posting this will give someone comfort or even open a door so may as well. \n\nTL;DR\n\nFantasized about being cared about but realized I can\u2019t make it happen because I need someone to care about me but can\u2019t get that because no one cares about me but if someone simply did then I could but on my own I can\u2019t \n\nSummary:\n\nCatch 22 - SNAFU - Irrelevant to national security:Ignore until further notice\n\n7 pages redacted\u2026",

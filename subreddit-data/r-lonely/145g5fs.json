Maybe a goodnight text or a simple \u201ehow are you\u201d. But nobody does that. Nobody texts me. I stopped reaching out to people and lost everyone. I dont know for how long things are like that but loneliness hit me. I know that other people my age are having fun, lots of friends and going out often. I want someone whos gonna text me, call me and hang out with me and someone who i could text with, call them without hearing the voicemail signal. Im so tired.",

    "postText": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI enjoy playing videogames and chilling to some music orchestra mostly, watching movies TV shows and I'm soon going to college Learn computing. I'm introverted too and I enjoy reading alot. it would be great to have someone to chat with (everyone ik is either working or busy)\nI am a talkative introvert. I indulge in a lot of hobbies as I like to spend a lot of time on my own:\nI play video games on my PS4. Games I have played from start to finish are The Witcher, all Tomb Raiders, and Uncharted. I wasn't brave enough to finish The Last Of Us, but I'm working on that. I also play ColdWar Zombies quite a lot. Though it does not mean I am any good at it.\nI read books. have been looking into thriller/crime books. I have read most classics in my younger years and I do enjoy poetry and a couple of self-help books.",

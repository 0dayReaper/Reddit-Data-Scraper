    "postText": "I first off want to say i\u2019m not trying to make this post in a way for attention but I literally have no one to vent too and feel this is a good place for that. \n\nThere is a concert happening next saturday and I would like to go but never have gone to any event alone. I asked 4 of my friends who I feel are good friends and all of them said no. This happens everytime I try to make plans with them and they\u2019re my only real friends. I have people that are nice to me and i\u2019m nice back but never would hangout outside of a group setting because we\u2019re not that close. \n\nI just feel like all I do is sit inside and not hangout with people because they are always \u201cbusy\u201d or don\u2019t want too and it\u2019s so annoying and I feel so lonely because i\u2019m making no memories and just stay inside. Going to this concert alone isn\u2019t something i\u2019m against but I just need advice from you all. I feel like i\u2019m great at making friends even though i have crazy social anxiety but they always end up as talk here and there and that\u2019s all. \n\nDo y\u2019all go to events alone and how\u2019s the experience? Do you make friends at these events? Any tips if I do go alone? \n\nI appreciate any and very comment. Life\u2019s been brutal and I feel lost but this might be something to help put a spark in myself doing mores alone and seeking out more friends. Thank you.",

But I had an awesome time, met some cool people, and enjoyed the night more than I usually would! That was like 8 years ago maybe? I've probably gone to 30+ concerts since alone - sometimes it's fun for me to just enjoy the night. You'll make friends, remember you're all there for the same reason. :)",

            "comment": "There are pros and cons to going to a concert alone vs with people. Going solo, you do not have to worry about others. I just went with some people and we ended up showing up late and leaving early. If I went alone, I would have seen the entire concert. So yeah, never have to worry if someone is having a good time, if they like where you are sitting/standing, or if they have to work at 5:30 am the next morning or whatever.\n\nI personally wouldn't even worry about trying to interact with people at the concert. Just go for the music and the experience and hopefully that lowers your anxiety, and if someone talks to you, just deal with that when that time comes, and maybe just talk about the band or something simple like that.\n\nIf you often sit inside and alone, all the more reason to go and change things up a bit. Stimulate yourself and do something fun. \n\nMost of the time I prefer going to concerts solo because I just want to focus on the music and get up front if possible and just enjoy the experience. However, sometimes I have had some nice memories with friends as well. It just depends. \n\nAnyways, there is no reason to not go. Have fun!",

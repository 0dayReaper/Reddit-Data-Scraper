    "postText": "Im so happy with my life and I have so many friends and people that genuinely love me. My personal advice would be to reflect on yourself more and think about some reasons as to why you may be so lonely -  I have read some stuff on reddit and I think that people generally tend to blame stuff on the way their life is and act like they have no control over it. This is ultimately just an excuse for being lazy and avoiding responsibility, yet no one wants to talk ab it. I have accepted the fact that life simply isn\u2019t so jolly all the time and I think part of maturing is coming to terms with this. Once you realise that you are technically not entitled to anything in this life and are not special or superior to other people in any way shape or form, you might actually start changing your life. Also I have absolutely lost my respect for all of the people that are actively trying to kill themselves, if you come across this and are one of those people, i hope you know that you are taking down at least 3-4 people down with you. People on here make me lose hope in humanity aswell, with their impressive means of justifying their nihilistic and selfish behaviour, and i will therefore be deleting this app shortly.",

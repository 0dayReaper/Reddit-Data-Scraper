    "postText": "I want to find a friend who I can talk to and listen about each other\u2019s lives. I want this to be a mutual thing. You talk and I talk. So only reach out if you will put in the effort. I\u2019m from the US, so if you\u2019re from another country, make sure your schedule matches mine. Otherwise, don\u2019t reach out, it will be difficult and I don\u2019t want that.\n\nAlso, texting is convenient and something we could do to stay in touch, but we also need to add calls to the mix. I don\u2019t want to hear that you need to know me first. \n\nMUST BE OKAY WITH CALLS. I\u2019m not making anyone message me and do calls. That\u2019s your choice, but if you do reach out it\u2019s because you\u2019re going to be doing calls with me :) And I don\u2019t mean share numbers, we can talk on an app. \n\nI enjoy walks and being out in the sun, now that the weather is getting warmer. \n\nI\u2019m 31, probably too old for some of you. I\u2019m single. I don\u2019t have children. I\u2019m in a good spot but just need that connection with people because I lack social skills. \n\nDon\u2019t reach out if you\u2019re married or in a relationship it\u2019s just awkward. You know exactly why it\u2019s awkward, if you don\u2019t then I definitely don\u2019t want to talk to you. I don\u2019t want to hear about your marital/relationship problems because I\u2019m not going to share any. \n\nIf the times below don\u2019t work for you or you won\u2019t be able to talk through these times then it won\u2019t work, so DO NOT reach out. \n\nI\u2019m in MST, USA. I wake up at 5am Monday to Friday and 6am on weekends. I sleep around 11pm each night. I would like it if we could talk throughout the day and start and end our days together. \n\nThanks. Send me a CHAT REQUEST if you want to try this. Include your location and in your own words tell me what you are looking for or I will not reply. I will NOT respond to messages or comments, ONLY CHAT. \n\nI also have other forms of communication if that works best for you.",

    "postText": "It is the end of my years of public schooling and so my childhood and adolescence and I never got to experience the fun things but that's alright....I am more devastated because I write letters very meaningful letters personal and from my heart to all of my teachers and to people who pretended like they were my friends we all have AVID together I was up all night writing them I only finished at 1:30 AM and no one seems to care at all...they all pretended to care and told me how sweet it was and begged me to let them open it right away but I thought for the letters to really have meaning they would have to know they wouldn't be seeing me in a long while so I made a rule of no opening until they're home and some even begged and acted so excited to open them and my number was in each one and no one, not one person has messaged me no one has no one wanted to I didn't say they had to but I thought at least one person would want to there were 14 classmates who were all considered friends of mine to different degrees and each letter was uniquely written for each individual person, it's been hours since school ended and those people who pretended to be so excited either haven't opened them yet or didn't care enough to send me a message. It hurts this would've been a great way to end high school to hear back from them to know but instead I've been waiting for hours and not one response yet......so I guess my memories will be painful this was my last shot at making it so that when I look back at my childhood and adolescence I think it was good or okay but now it's just sad it will always be sad because it's over now and I can't go back and I can't fix it....and I miss my daydreams I wish when I used to dream and I wish I could've made some of those daydreams come true.....",

Like once something is done it's done...and I honestly feel I've done too much to the point I don't want this person[whoever and whatever the fuck this is now] to live a content life. To live at all...I don't think I get to choose...I feel I ruin that choice. That I ruin everything. Naturally...like I'm either too naturally mental, evil or retarded to ever get it right and what I do will be a fluke. What I do I will not only ruin but make unforgivably fucked...as if possessed or cursed, doomed from the start to not only suffer but bring suffering upon all who come into contact with me and I'm tired. I'm fucking tired! Lmao...I don't want this thing to live. I want to end its reign of terror for good... perhaps that's why I look in the mirror and unironically I don't know who tf this is anymore. All I know is I want to kill it. But it...it's so fucking pathetic it... considering all it's done like it's the victim?? I want it to suffer...to the point it really is a scared creature in a corner...so broken to the point the option of killing itself is non-existent...I fucking hate you. Lmao I FUCKING HATE YOUUUU!...I fucking hate you...all I want to do is let go and you keep me fucking prisoner...I'm fucking chained to you sick bastard...what did you expect? You made me into this? I didn't even want to do this to you and now I can't live with myself for hurting you. Lol I became you....what now? Look at us. It's not even gonna matter anymore. What good is dead...I think we traded places but I won't cower, I won't fucking cry! ILL SHOW YOU HOW ITS DONE! ILL SHOW YOU HOW FUCKED IT CAN GET!...bc this is what you wanted. You didn't want to die so this is what you'll have to witness...you'll become exactly...the...thing you...are...wow. That's why I'm not dead. Actually thank you for showing me the way, I misunderstood you. This is me and it always was.",

            "comment": "Just me with myself...there never was a change. A version of me to hate. I hate myself and apparently I hate the world more still being here. My reluctance to kill myself was just me being unsatisfied...I lost my way...I got scared...mistaken...it's always been 'fuck this place, fuck these people'. I have no more excuses. All of it can go. It's always been wrong and to be so abrupt and part of my ridiculousness...I'll be right. It doesn't mean a fucking thing, no matter who you are. It won't mean a fucking thing... intrusive thoughts? I'm not laughing so maybe not. Maybe fucking not. All of you, everyone, everything. I hate you all.",

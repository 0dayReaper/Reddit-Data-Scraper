    "postText": "I wonder if imm allowed to ask but, would any of u pay for a friend? \nI never thought of charging people to talk, it seemee ridiculous. but i'm in an abusive household and i'm just trying to get out.. I figured with all my time if I used it to  charge people to talk to me then I would be able to finally leave.  This isnt an advertisement but, more me wondering peoples opinions on this. on one hand i feel guilty because i always talk to people just cause i love doing so. i'm scared if money is involved then people may feel like my care isn't genuine, even though it is. But I have so much time and so little money.. I wondered if this could be a route I choose. I'm lonely as hell man, and I just want to do something with all my time that might benefit my wellbeing too :/ please give opinions!! i dont know if there is websites that offer such services, or if anyone in here has used any please let me know",

Six months ago one of my high school buddies made the same decision that your brother did, that fucked me up. One of the last things he told me was how lucky I was. I had no idea he felt the way he did at the time, this was a month before.\n\nAll I can tell you is that life is a series of choices and circumstances. You can only control yourself and the choices that you make and how you will respond to circumstances. Live to honor your brothers memory and focus on how you can impact others that are still with us. \nI know you have probably heard this before but it is not your fault.\n\nNo matter how bad you feel you can always turn your life around, there is nothing in this world worth taking your own life for. However, there are many things worth giving and dedicating every waking moment to. I just wish I could tell my friend and your brother that. \n\nGod bless you brother. There is always a light at the end of the tunnel, we just can't see it sometimes.",

If you really wanna help someone who's suicidal, BE the reason to live for. Be kind to them, be understanding. Show them that the world isn't a heaping pile of shit. Telling someone what to feel won't help. They need to feel it themselves through experience.\n\nThis doesn't make you responsible for what they do because some people's issues run quite deep, but if you DO want to at least try something, I would recommend doing it through your actions, not your words.",

He was on a three hour drive to my house when he got stopped and I sometimes feel guilty for not making sure he made it safely. It hurt for a long time before I learned that he made choices in life and had circumstances that I couldn\u2019t change. I try to live in his honor too: I have adopted his cat and make sure she is happy, I talk to girls with confidence like he always urged me to do, I take the cleanliness and appearance of my vehicle seriously (he was an auto detailer) and I treat people with love and kindness knowing that he was lacking that from the people that he cared about. \n\nThe best life coping skill I have learned lately is that it\u2019s not so important what happens to you (there will always be unreconcilable pain) but how you let the event shape you. You seem to understand a lot of what I just typed, so give yourself credit for that and find peace within yourself. Cheers and love",

Mom to many fur and fin babies and mother figure to some teens I've taken on and into my home in a guardianship or foster parent sort of role.\n\nI've lost enough people for it to feel like a curse. Uncle in '95, best friend, more like a brother in '99 (we toddled around in diapers together) a good friend in 2010 and last but of course not least..dad in 2016.\n\n I struggle with health issues. Depression as well as Fibromyalgia so..chronic pain is a daily battle.\n\n I won't lie and say life is rainbows and puppy dogs. I get these dreams that can ruin my whole day and leave me a weeping mess. (Usually about my friend Chaz. In my dream I learn he faked his death and it's awful. I wake up sobbing.\n What gets me through is my husband, music, and my hobbies. Macrame..anything that keeps my hands busy. \n\n Those hobbies and interests may not interest everyone and thats cool. Find what brings YOU peace and joy. Adorable kitten videos, model building..whatever your thing is..cling to it! Explore when you can. \n\n  Nothing will ever beat a good therapist or counselor. For some people this isn't an option. In this case, reach out to someone you trust and love.\n\n I know the voice that tells you that you are worthless and alone. I have my own version of that voice. \n\n I promise you, no matter how convincing that voice may SEEM. It couldn't be more wrong.\n\n People DO see you, people DO care.\n\nThey might not be sure how to help. Or if their help is welcome or wanted.\n\n Do not let that negative voice convince you that you aren't worthy. You absolutely are! \n\n Not sure how to reach out? I get it..how about..\"Hey (insert friends name here) I'm really struggling right now.\"\n\n Chances are they WILL ask what they can do to help! Not sure what you even need? Thats also totally fine.\n\n Maybe it's just an ear. Maybe what calms you is some chocolate covered chocolate lol. (I've got a friend, total chocolate fiend) when she feels blue and overwhelmed you'd better believe I'm at her door with a bag of her favorite chocolates. lol \n\n For another friend some of my home brewed Iced Coffee is the ticket. We will sit, share a cup and just talk. Doesn't even have to be about the thing that is bothering her. \n\n Sometimes just being heard makes you feel better. \n\nSometimes others may come up with a solution that hadn't even occured to you because you are too close to it.\n\n Let people surprise you! &lt;3",

Relationships end, not all ofcourse, but some do, and if yours would be to end you will feel far worse and lonlier than before. Im saying all this from personal experience. And if the other person feels that you become dependent on them for your happiness it might scare them away.\n\nI wish you all the best, just wanted to warn you of something I did a lot of times( get in a relationship to end my loneliness and thing ended even worse than before)",

It is natural to want companionship- evolution has made us that way.  True, it is possible to deal with being alone your entire life, and obviously a lot of people have to do this out of necessity, but most people would likely feel lonely in this situation, and that's nothing to be ashamed of.  There's also nothing wrong with being relieved when that loneliness ends due to having found a companion.  Perhaps OP is already comfortable with himself, just relieved that there is a break from loneliness, and not \"putting all his eggs in one basket.\"  I would be worried that someone who could simply choose not to be lonely is lying to himself/ herself or has underlying mental issues.  Because it's unnatural for a human to be able to do that.  I speak from experience.",

Just speaking from personal experience if you this girl becomes the only source of happiness in your life and you guys end up breaking up it will literally destroy you. It\u2019s far better to have never found someone in the first place than to have to go through breakup like that. Being lonely sucks don\u2019t get me wrong but waking up one day to realize the light of your life, the person who made you understand what it\u2019s like to love someone so much it actually physically hurts, isn\u2019t next to you in bed. You loved this person so much you would literally do anything for them. You\u2019d stab yourself through the heart without hesitation or second thought for them if it meant keeping them safe. But now, even though you still love them more than anyone you\u2019ve ever known, they don\u2019t love you anymore. In fact they stopped loving you long before they left, and they\u2019re never going to love you again. \n\nHeartbreak like that is worse than death. It\u2019s not just feeling lonely again. It\u2019s literally constant agony, constant intrusive thoughts of what you could\u2019ve done differently, reminders of how they\u2019re gone and have already moved on. And every single thought hurts like a pain you\u2019ve never felt before. It\u2019s a deep ache so intense that you\u2019ll literally want to be dead to make it stop. truly the only thing that eases the pain is to numb yourself with drugs and alcohol but you never truly feel better. You\u2019ll take this pain to the grave, it diminishes with time but it never goes away fully.",

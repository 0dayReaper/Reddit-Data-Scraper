    "postText": "I am 20 year old female. I have never been in a relationship. I haven\u2019t had my first kiss yet. Since I haven\u2019t had an emotionally present father figure, I struggle a lot with men. I get very anxious and I don\u2019t know how to talk or behave with men. I know that this might sound weird but this is how it goes for me.\nAs soon as I start talking with a boy, I get attached and obsessed meanwhile I don\u2019t even know them or like them like that. Lately I have understood that I \u201ccrave\u201d romance. Never had this problem before, always been just fine by myself. \nAnyone experiences the same thing when talking to boys? Just getting attached and obsessed? I feel like I just like the attention from a male figure since I have never had that in my life,not even from my own father..",

Well i suggest you do some reading on romance. That will give you an idea on how to approach boys.\n\nAnd no you are perfectly normal. Most girls your age crave romance. \n\nA lack of father is a different issue. I don't know much about you. So i can't comment on it.",

            "comment": "Guys have this same issue in the reverse, and in general communication has seemed to become more difficult. So, the advice ive seen here is spot on. You will definitely need to be careful in dating or certain social aspects. But confidence comes with time learning strategies to stay safe, knowing yourself and how you feel, and also just not rushing into anything. You honestly dont need a relationship until you feel ready and until you start to learn what you want in life, and in turn, what kind of partner. Obsession isnt a good thing, but it comes from a lack in your life, so it usually has a draining effect. In my own experience I usually had a very small group of friends, so it was easy for me to be excited about my friend or a girl i was interested in. But, when plans would fall through or others wouldnt hold me in the same regard, it definitely hurt. You have identified a source of pain for you, so now that you are aware, you can learn ways to not let it affect you. Its okay to want fatherly or the affection of a partner, just dont let anyone use that against you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, you arent weird. Im pretty sure a lot of people can relate to your situation immensely. Im glad you are looking for a solution and hope for the best. Just take it a step at a time and get all the info that you can. Be it youtube, books, articles, whatever works for you. If you do, I think youll be able to succeed and help others as well. Good luck",

I didn't have a father figure either and in response I had a crush on literally any boy my age, but I could not talk to them. I remember having a big crush on a boy in elementary school and I told a friend and she told him and he liked me back and wanted to talk to me so he spent the entire recess chasing me while I frantically ran away out of fear of talking to him. \nThen when I got to middle school through highschool I learned to simply flirt with every single boy. I don't know how to be just friendly, only flirty. This did help me get my first kiss and all the fun stuff but now I'm in a committed relationship and I have to simply not talk to men in real life at all because I can't stop myself from flirting because I don't know how else your supposed to talk to men",

Since I haven\u2019t had an emotionally present father figure, I struggle a lot with men.\n\nI actually heard the opposite, when women with absent fathers (emotional or physical) tend to be over sexual even hit puberty earlier. So in a way if this is why you're a slight outlier. \n\n&gt;I get very anxious and I don\u2019t know how to talk or behave with men. I know that this might sound weird but this is how it goes for me.\n\nMaybe in the grand scheme, but a shy girl is incredibly normal.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe\n\n&gt;Anyone experiences the same thing when talking to boys? Just getting attached and obsessed? \n\nIt's more common than you think, but at least you're aware of it now, before you make some really bad decisions.\n\nThis is what counselling or therapy is for but so far, it's not a dangerous issue, in many ways you're fortunate to be this self aware.",

Especially doing Roleplay where someone is rejected by others or cast out, I take them under my wing and give their character a loving home. Though as for actual fatherly figure type stuff I'm not sure if I can ever take care of a child wether adopted or my own, cause it just seems too unbearable and exhausting. I'm the one person I know, who yes admittedly I want a gf/future wife but I get that maybe there's not someone for everyone and I can do fairly well alone. (It may seem weird me being around your age and all but if you ever needed to talk/vent or even just a shoulder to cry on, I would be here to try my best to comfort you)!\n\nWishing you the best of luck in your endeavors\nAnd perhaps you may even find a good guy or whatever you're into, to take care of you and love you for you. Hope you have a great day/night.",

            "comment": "I have definitely gone through an easily obsessed/attached stage for a large portion of my adult life also. I definitely had a strong mother figure though so I don't really assign it to that, and the women I fall for do not remind me of my mother at all either.\n\nI think I just felt very lonely and empty when I realized my peers at school mostly made fun of me and they seemed like a more valid judge of me than my family that would always have personal biases towards me and tell me how wonderful I was. So when I did find someone who I thought was stunningly beautiful and sweet and warm, it felt like she would be the answer to my pain and sadness and I suddenly craved that affection from that person more than anyone else in the world. I always would have these crushes where I could see in her eyes, smile, mannerisms, sound of her voice that it felt like the person was made with my exact deepest emotional needs in mind, and I knew that wasn't actually what was going on, but the fact that it felt like that was scary. And that led to very intense, obsessive crushes, just about all of which were not returned. They always seemed to feel I was a good person, many of them liked spending time with me, none of them wanted to be with me romantically.\n\nFalling for them would put me into this very weak, vulnerable space where I would often feel like I was just dying for merely a hug from that person. Any validation would make me happier. But to kiss them or sleep with them was like this impossible dream. What would happen then? Would my head explode? Would I need medical attention? Would I hyperventilate in the fetal position for the next 30 minutes? I used to wonder these things. Or would I be fine and just really, REALLY fulfilled and a more relaxed person? Does any of that resonate with you too or do I just sound like a crazy person?",

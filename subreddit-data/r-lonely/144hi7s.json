I'm audrey, 20 years old, non-binary. because of an incident in my friend group, I'm thinking about trying to branch out a little farther and find some new cool people to talk to and be friends with. here's a little bit about me:\n\n\u2022 I love horror/slasher movies! to name a few of my favorites: Scream, It, BODIES BODIES BODIES, Gerald's Game, The Babysitter, etc.\n\n\u2022 I sing/write music and play a variety of different instruments, such as guitar, piano, drums, etc.\n\n\u2022 I love cats. cats are my favorite animals ever and I will gladly show pictures of my cats if asked to. I also have a turtle and a dog :)\n\nthat's a little bit about me, and I'm interested in getting to know you too! all I ask is that you just please don't be sexual or creepy or gross, and I'd prefer if you were a girl or also non-binary, but guys are welcome too! feel free to message me and if I trust you I'll provide my socials :)",

    "postText": "Or is it? Why can't it be?\n\nIn my case I'm referring to women I don't know. Like today I was at the grocery store looking at some hanging flower plants. A woman came along and expressed concern that she was going to take the one I was interested in. I just nodded no it's fine. At the same time I thought, \"wow how thoughtful of her to even be concerned about that.\" So, I noticed she was close to my age, and hoped I would see her later inside the store.\n\nOnce I finished shopping, sure enough I noticed her in line at the cashiers but there was a shorter line available so I went there. She must have noticed because she changed lines and suddenly there she was right behind me. She made some small talk about the plant I bought and seemed super friendly. So, I got some nerve and asked her is she was into bike riding? She said yes, and asked how did I know? I said hesitantly, because of her legs (they were very muscular) She wasn't annoyed or anything so I asked if it was mountain biking? Correct again, and she started talking about the importance of having a high quality bike. So, at this point it seems like fate, as I love mountain biking, but suddenly it's her turn with the cashier so she starts talking to her, and...what could I do ? I couldn't just stand there so...my heart sank as I slowly carried my groceries away.\n\nI took my time loading my truck in hopes to see her in the parking lot, and she appeared but turned towards her car and that was that. I didn't have the nerve to walk over to her car and ask her if she wanted to go bike riding sometime.\n\nI don't know, it shouldn't be hard to do at all but something in me just short circuits and blocks me. In the case she showed she was receptive to talking so...seems like I have an unconscious fear that sabotages even an easy opportunity like this.\n\nI am very frustrated with myself. Watching a boring baseball game alone at home tonight isn't helping. It's my own doing. :/",

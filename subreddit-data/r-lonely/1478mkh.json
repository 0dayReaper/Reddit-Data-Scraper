I post that I\u2019m struggling and that\u2019s all it takes for the men to come flooding my DMs about how they relate, only to cause more harm to me themselves. I always feel like I\u2019m to blame for posting about my struggles, like I should know better than to rely on anyone other than myself. \n\nI feel so lonely cuz of this.

I'm talking generally for men, like I take part of the blame cause I know where it comes from.

I was very skeptical about Reddit too. But I have got to say I\u2019ve found one friend out here that made me feel completely different. There\u2019s definitely good people out here. U just need to have that patience. And this friend taught me one of the smartest things to do. Before u speak to someone, go thru their comments and see how they talk out in the open before u start chatting with them in ur DMs. When u talk to people on ur DMs, make sure u continue conversations with those that don\u2019t push u for personal details. Remain calm and patient until u feel confident enough about the persons character: make sure they are here just to talk to you as friends and not here with an ulterior motive.\n\nI\u2019ve sent my picture to 2 people out here. One has ghosted me lately and the other continues to be a really good friend. I haven\u2019t even had such an energetic and fun conversation with people Irl. U would be surprised how good a person can be to you if you set the vibe and tone of ur conversation right. It takes as much effort here on Reddit as u would have to give Irl. And remember, efforts go both ways. You need to put in time and understand their schedules and respect that too.Be patient and I\u2019m sure u will find someone who respects your time as much as u desire.\n\nSorry for the really long reply:)",

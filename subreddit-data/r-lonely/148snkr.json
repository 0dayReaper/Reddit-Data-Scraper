    "postText": "Nothing here is me. Nothing here is right. It's all forced convincing and when it ends that'll just be the case. I'm detatched and hatefully so...funny bc I can never hope to understand what I hate just know I can never adapt to such things and feel just doing so. I know what I desire. I know who I am. And I hate those things, all life and everything observable which is funny that's not even me being hyperbolic. I hate it all. And I never will understand it. Not truly. Because I feel so much I lose the sense of even having reason. I feel so detached I lose the sense of having directed targets. I feel so detached I lose the sense of being at all. All of it is worthy of hate and all of it must and will go. And perhaps not literal everything but mentally all worthy of that hatred when confronted will be just. All will be wrong in the face of me. And in my presence will be brought to an end.",

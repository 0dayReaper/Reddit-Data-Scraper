If you're struggling to find your own reasons to exist on this mortal plane then you can always try existing for the sake of someone else as a temporary stop gap. I find that people default to one of two motivations for living. One type lives for themselves and their ambitions (they are often regarded as selfish for chasing their desires), and the other type lives for the approval of others (they are often called pushovers for catering to the desires of others). Noting that you're going to receive criticism either way, you either learn to challenge yourself to do something you want to do, or you learn to challenge yourself to do as others want of you. Either existence brings along with it suffering, but both existences allow you to enact a measure of self value either derived from your personal accomplishments on behalf of yourself or your personal accomplishments on behalf of others. Both are necessary for society even if both involving suffering.",

Because I know leaving would mess them up even if they don't know it, or may possibly want me to leave. Aside from them and my two siblings who I don't even speak to or see anymore, I have nobody.\n\nLife is too incredible to leave because it's uncomfortable, hard, painful, lonely and tormenting.\n\nWhat I mean is, have you ever really wondered, how the hell anything can be? Or what existence is?\n\nTurmoil, torment, pain and misery and heartache I will endure, because life is really aggravatingly mysterious and I must try to get to the bottom of it. So that is the other reason I stay.\n\nAnother reason I stay is because we have a natural instinct for survival, and while we can entertain stories in our head about wanting to pull the plug, that's one small aspect of our being which is saying that and most of what you are as a human being actually positively does not want to die. I mean it like really really wants to live. So that's useful to know when it's not apparent to us.\n\nAbout unbearable feelings, as you go through life it gets better, and you build a kind of emotional pain tolerance just like you would a physical pain tolerance with painful experiences.\n\nIf you're open to advice, I would say that there are two important things in life I would tell you and anybody that are invaluable. One is don't judge other people (not that I think you do it's just my universal advice). And the other is *learn* to willingly feel all your feelings without either reacting to them or running away from them. I would stand by that advice, put my money on it (don't have any) and give it to past and future self. I wholeheartedly stand by it.",

            "comment": "Hi there, my friend. I\u2019m sorry that you are in the situation you\u2019re in. It is so demoralizing to have a go at life alone, especially without any family. \n\nI can only say two things:\n\n1. By opting out of this life, you guarantee there will be nothing to live for, forever. \n\n2. You don\u2019t necessarily need anybody to lead a meaningful and fulfilling life. This is hard enough for me to swallow, and I have some support (albeit none nearby). \n\nThe second point is the most important one, mostly because you, regardless of how you feel about yourself or your circumstances, are a capable individual.\n\nJust from this post, you\u2019ve demonstrated a few things:\n\n1. You recognize that the state you are in is one that needs to change. \n\n2. You have access to technology, of the sort that probably gives you access to the Internet, where there is access to nearly anything you could look for these days. You can develop skills, find therapists, talk to us on Reddit, find a way out of your situation, from a few clicks or scrolls. \n\n3.  You speak English. And likely, at least one other language based on the global literacy statistics. \n\n4. You, considering your age, gender, creed, education and lived experience, have your own tragically beautiful set of life experiences to learn from and contribute to making this world even slightly more habitable, pleasant and enjoyable for the rest of us. I have no idea what your situation(s) are, but they all contributed in some way to who you are now. If that\u2019s not the highest calling to action in life, I don\u2019t know what is. \n\nThere\u2019s this quote that I found so interesting. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s attributed to Einstein, Edison or someone else, but it goes something like this, \u201cI didn\u2019t find one way to build a lightbulb before I learned 10,000 ways how not to make one\u201d. The point is that if you haven\u2019t found out well enough yet what makes you tick, there\u2019s a long way to go and many options always to try. \n\nFinally, there\u2019s one quote that sticks with me during the worst, most lonely and upsetting times of my life. It\u2019s attributed to a poet, Khalil Gibran, \u201cAnd God said love your enemy, so I obeyed and loved myself.\u201d\n\nThat last part is the hardest thing for me to do right now. I feel so wretchedly small and low. I feel like a failure, like a little hateful roach. But what gets me through the day is knowing that if I keep trying, eventually things statistically just have to improve, even if it\u2019s marginally. You can\u2019t keep applying to jobs or trying new techniques or going to community events in the hopes of making friends or trying new exercise regimens relentlessly without something working to your favor eventually. It\u2019s just not possible.\n\n\nI have endured this cycle a few times in my life for various reasons and the biggest predictor of things getting better was putting myself out into the world again, as unashamed as I could be, to soak up the opportunities before me\u2014for friends, for work, for health, for myself. \n\nAnd patience. To this day, the biggest problem I have is being patient with my progress. Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day, as they say. Things will go at their own pace, but the only sure fire way you guarantee is if you stop. Don\u2019t stop.\n\nIf you need anything else, please reach out anytime. I will try my best to be supportive during this difficult time. \n\nAnd for my sake, if no one else\u2019s, if you are contemplating anything permanent, think of this post first and then dial your emergency line, wherever you are. Don\u2019t make a permanent mark on a chapter, a footnote if you will, on the vast novel that is your life.",

Take the time you need to figure out where you want to go next. When you get there, get comfortable, then decide on your next destination.\n\nAlso, I'm just gonna say, not judging you or anything, but asexual doesn't mean what you think it means. Being asexual as a human means no sexual attraction to any gender. That's it, that's the description.\n\nAsexuals can have other forms of attraction for people, if any. Like aesthetic attraction(how much you like someone's physical appearance), sensual attraction(wanting to hug or cuddle with someone) or emotional attraction(wanting to get to know someone for their personality). Also, contrary to popular belief, asexuals can have varying degrees of active libido(but some do not) just like anyone else. I know, I know, typically it's thought all that goes hand in hand with each other, but that doesn't mean they're all the same thing and they don't always go hand in hand.\n\nPeople can't help being asexual anymore then someone who is heterosexual can help wanting to be with people of the opposite sex.",

Maybe if you worded it as  \"I've never had true intimacy with someone\" people would understand you're not just referring to sex, but I really don't think virginity is the word to use for what you're trying to get across.",

Who likes me, or hell, even just lusts after me (would be a nice boost to the self-esteem). But mostly I just want to feel cared for. I want someone to want me.\n\nI crave physical affection, but mostly when paired with emotional intimacy as well. Which is why I won't do things like prostitutes. You can pay for sex, but you can't pay someone to genuinely care about you. \n\nBut I dont mind some platonic cuddling from a friend. But that doesn't happen, either because I am a straight guy.

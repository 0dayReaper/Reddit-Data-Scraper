    "postText": "I always feel kinda lonely because I never had a girlfriend and don't have friends, but this feeling was worse today because I saw people I know posting on social media about the Halloween parties they were going to and those who stayed home posting how they decided to binge a scary movie with their boyfriend/girlfriend.\n\nI got a few drinks to try and make the sadness go away but no luck, so I decided to say fuck it and spend some money to make myself feel better. I hired a sex worker.\n\nAt first, as soon as she arrived I kind of regretted it, she asked for money upfront and didn't seem to be in the best of moods but I don't blame her, then I told her I didn't really want sex and just wanted to cuddle and watch something. I think she felt pity for me because we planned for a 1-hour session and when the time was up I was ready for her to leave but she stayed and told me \"I'm having a good time\". She ended up staying almost 3 hours cuddling with me.\n\nAfter we watched a few episodes of a tv show she stayed a bit longer and when she was leaving I offered to pay for the extra time she stayed but she didn't take it, just told me I was sweet and that she liked cuddling and watching Netflix. I know she only did this either because she felt pity or because it was easy money just watching Netflix with some dude but this is the first time in a while I've felt human.\n\nI think something a lot of people who have friends and a partner don't really realize that sex isn't really the main point lonely people are making, we just want to feel like we belong and that someone cares for us even if it is just for a moment.",

There are situations where people just *are* with each other more easily, but that's usually not all the time to my understanding of it? The most transactional relationships are in the more professional realm, then the functional everyday realm is the middle ground, etcetera.\n\nPeople just dont expel their energy/vulnerability too easily. I think they start where its safer and the rest is a mix of timing in each other's lives?",

This is going to be hard for a lot of people to stomach but it's true and even if it hurts you need to pull the bandaid off so you can move past the pain (physical, mental and emotional) but here it goes. Either get busy going after what you want unyielding or give up and stop stressing out about it. If you really want something to happen keep trying to do it. The possibility of getting lucky are null. Try it nonstop no matter how many times you fail try again.and try and try, stop waiting and take action. No one is going to walk up to you and give you a car you have to find one. A partner isn't going to just magically appear you have to find them so start looking. If you are incapable of that then say \"yes you do still want it\" but accept you will never obtain it and move on to something else because if you're never going to obtain it then why spend energyon it. I have crippling social anxiety. I walk up 14 flights of stairs everyday at work because im terrified of being on the elevator with people that might talk to me. The realistic chances of me being able to approach another person yet alone a woman (x2 if i think she is attractive) are zero. The way my brain is programmed won't let me. Like how you can't bite your own finger off. Your brain won't let you. The chances of a woman approaching me are slim by default as a social norm. But even if a women were to show interest in me my brain won't allow me to reciprocate the attraction back to her. So I've had to accept that i will never be in a partnership. Yea it bums me out but i can't do anything about it. I want my childhood dog back too but that's never going to happen either. What matters is the *acceptance*. My dog is dead and that is fact. I want him back yes but i accept it's not going to happen. Same with a relationship. I imagine it is something good but an experience i will never have. That's just how it is and I've accepted that. Feel the hurt of (the dog is never coming back) and then let the acceptance move you past the pain so you can move on to accomplish other things.",

I've dated both men and women but never got pressured for sex by women, but have very often been pressured by men. But that's just my experience, although I hear it's similar for plenty.

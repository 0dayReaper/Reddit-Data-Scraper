    "postText": "I see all of these groups of friends going out and doing dumb stuff together.\nThe \"college is so much fun\" people.\n\nI feel like there's a large portion of life that I just don't get to experience because I'm so alone. Fun adventures and crazy stories that all these people seem to have and I can't help but feel jealous.\n\nEverything I do is more fun when done socially. The only social interaction I get is from my work and everyone eventually gets annoyed by me and distances themselves.\nI've almost had friends a few times before, it was really awesome.\n\nDies anyone feel this way too? There seems to be a large portion of life that I will never get to experience because I have nobody to share it with. I've never been anyone's friend for longer than a month, but that was back in middle school, and now that I'm 25 I fear that this will never change. The only people that ever like me are simply because of situational proximity. One the proximity is gone then so are they.",

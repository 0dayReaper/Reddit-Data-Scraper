    "postText": "A few months back I found myself thinking about everything and how I didn\u2019t have someone to call a lover. It didn\u2019t bother me. For 4 months, I thought the dread was gone. I decided to hang out with my friend. I also happen to find this friend adorable and sweet. I\u2019m attracted to their entire personality. I got home and was upset that I couldn\u2019t spend more time with them, but I tried to let it go. I couldn\u2019t. I just couldn\u2019t help but find myself back in my own thoughts about why I\u2019m alone and why this person that i would love to have around is just completely out of my reach. So now here I am again.",

    "postText": "So not long ago, ive posted something that should have brought ppl so i can make friends. You know, the usual post on this subreddit. And i got some response, and i got 2 ppl to talk to. For those who reached out, Im sorry, lost my conection to reddit, thats why i didnt respond, but later to those who i did respont to and reach out to, didnt repond and my DMs are empty as ever, so please, dont say i ignored or something. I reached out, just not emediatly... Anyways, the 2 ppl i found were... Questionable. One was a girl, 14 years old. She was emediatly into having a relationship online and stuff, despite me saying i just need a friend. I was wierded out, but after some time, i agreed bc i didnt want her to leave, my mission was to make conections with people, not push them away. So naturaly, things turn sexual really quick. Ive always noted that things are going too fast or smething, but every time she became sad and i was afraid ill loose a person and have nobody to talk to. After some time, she said that she did something bad and that her family will take her phone. I actualy started to like the times we talk, so i was kinda sad that we no longer talk. But her usual excuses and things she said always seemed like lies and a bit wierd... And the 2nd person was a guy, 21 years. He seemes like a huge ego guy, who thinks he is very smart and all that and that he is the alpha male or something and that i should be thankeful that he reached out to me. And he said he has a \"family\" or better say, random ppl who call him wierd names and like idk worship him or something? Very wierd... Anyways, i wasnt sure how to aproach him. Wether i was friendly, acting dumb, smart, creepy, sexual, or anything else, he was always the same. He likes to send voice messages, and he always acts like he knows stuff, always has a long pause bc he saw that silence is the key on a \"how to be alpha male\" on a youtube video. And always says \"let me tell you something\" and then says the most generic advice even a new born baby knows. I tried venting too, but to no help. Now he does not respond. Im not sure how to talk to people. In my last post ive said i want someone who i can try and be myself with, someone who i can open up to, but it seems i cant and probably never will. Yall are really wierd, and awful people. Ive made a 2nd acc on where i can browse some other subreddits like r/memes or r/shitposting or subs like that so nobody can see that i visit those places, plus i visit many subreddits of countries and such. I see that people really are hurt by others bc of their lies and actions. All of you need to understand that the word \"friend\" is a strong word, and that you cant just use it bc u feel like it. Yall are not friends, yall are manipulators who just manipulate people for your own benefit. Just like that girl who wanted ppl online for sexual stuff or that guy who was apareantly so popular and even had a wierd worship family thing, but he was still on the r/lonely ? Yea, not sus at all. So, please, think before you do or say something. And be careful of how you use the word \"friend\". Just bc you think you are one, does not mean you are. (sorry for bad english and spelling) What do you think of people on this subreddit or other subreddits for lonely people who are looking for other people?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

My advice is to just be sensible and clearly communicate that you desire nothing more than a friendship. If they become irritating and are clearly trying to take advantage of your mental state then just block em, they\u2019re overstepping the boundaries you set after all.",

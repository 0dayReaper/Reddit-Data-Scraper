    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nFelt lonely to varying degrees for many years. Loneliness been weighing particularly heavy for the last months.\n\nHere's what I've noticed: though I feel lonely throughout the day, it doesn't bother me that much in the mornings. Like on most days the only notifications I would see straight after waking up would be just apps  rather than a text from a friend. Also I know that though it's a new day/new opportunity, I wouldn't meet smb new. It does bother but I make peace with those things and go on with my day.\n\nThe time it's getting closer to night time is when my loneliness causes greatest distress in me, for some reason. If I cry from feeling extremely lonely and unseen, it usually happens at night. I start analysing every situation when I've been rejected and seeking answers to why my social life has been either quite boring at some stages of my life or literally non-existent for most of the time. Also feel extremely sad about not having SO with whom I would discuss how our days go.\n\nAnyone can relate to this?",

So when the light go out, we are alone with a person we don\u2019t really like. \n\nI would recommend you try to be kinder to yourself, start a conversation about the positives you do have, or pick something you want to change that would make you feel better. Then identify the first step. Then celebrate the achievement of that step. Tell yourself that yes, you might suck, but at least you\u2019ve done X. \nThen, do another thing or take the next step. Repeat. \n\n\nThe more you are at peace with yourself, the easier it will get, and suddenly, others will notice it. \n\nRemember, it\u2019s a journey, a marathon. And it is different for each one of us. That\u2019s what makes it both beautiful and difficult.",

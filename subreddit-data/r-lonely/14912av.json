    "postText": "Extroverted friendly coworker: What are you doing for your birthday today?\n\nMe in reality: I'll be at home, in my underwear, playing some game I've been mindlessly droning for the past week, and I am completely okay with that.\n\nWhat I told her: Oh just having a few drinks with some of my friends.\n\n\nI know if I told her the truth, they'll feel the social obligation to pull me out for something special. Sure I would like to celebrate with some friends, but I am perfectly fine being alone on this particular day. I hate the awkward dance of 'Oh... not doing anything?' that it's easier for both of us if I just lie about something simple.\n\nThere were many times I felt terribly even more alone because I had to lie about a special occasion. Graduation celebrations, New Years Eve, a day off. \n\nTldr: Being made to feel bad about something that I didn't previously care about.",

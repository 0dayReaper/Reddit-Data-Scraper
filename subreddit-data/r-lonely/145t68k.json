Everyone always leaves me for better people in the end, I\u2019m just not good enough i guess. I just asked them if they wanted to get dinner together and of course they decline saying they\u2019ve made other plans and don\u2019t make any further attempt to reschedule. What was I expecting they never liked me and i will never have a legitimate friend. I just want to die already every day i wish id die in my sleep fml",

Even I feel like Im cursed or something coz I got no friends now, the few ones which I had are either too busy or lost touch with them with time. What I tell myself is people will come and go, barely will stick or stay. You should start enjoying your own company.",

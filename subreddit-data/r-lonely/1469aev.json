I do the same, not out loud, but in my head, with the people that help me too, and it brings me down to earth and i feel more grounded. it means you have learnt from their teachings and are reflecting / reprocessing it, to see what they'd say. this is actually a wonderful tool that you have picked up, so don't be down on yourself about it - it's very healthy!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ngive yourself a pat on the back for it! or maybe imagine your therapist saying 'good job' (poor joke - but this is all good!!)",

    "postText": "Im gathering an army for heaven or hell. Im looking forward to hell because this is my own personal hell. How can it get worse for me? But anyways, when you see me there in due time do you wanna help me kill god anyone? Anything is possible. Especially killing a fraudulent god. Someone who fools everyone into thinking he\u2019s the good guy but is really just a moron. Obviously we don\u2019t know what this job will look like because we don\u2019t know what the after life looks like but if there is one thing I swear to god about its that IM GOING TO FUCKING KILL YOU! I know I\u2019m smart enough and I know I\u2019ll find other geniuses that\u2019ll definitely help. We got eternity so I\u2019m in no rush, who\u2019s down for the score of a lifetime?\n\nEdit: if you seen the boys we are essentially trying to kill homelander but on a much larger scale",

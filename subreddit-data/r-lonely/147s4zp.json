The freedom to just go and do whatever I want without anyone complaining that they don\u2019t want to do said thing. \n\nBut it gets lonely sometimes. Somedays the being alone gets so lonely that it takes me down in to a depressed and anxious state that I do everything about to ignore. Which isn\u2019t a good solution, cause it will just haunted me the next time. \n\nYeh that was it \ud83d\ude43 have a good day/evening/night",

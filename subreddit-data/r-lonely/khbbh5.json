    "postText": "I turned 27 on the 15th, so not quite 30 yet, but with how fast these 7 years have flown by I know I'll be there soon. I haven't had any real friends in about 15 years and I've never even kissed a girl. I get along with people fine, no one really ever dislikes me. Hell, I even get praised for how well I can read and empathize with people. But despite that, I am completely unable to form any deep connection with anybody. Due to circumstance, and then later anxiety, I was pretty much completely socially isolated between the ages of 13 and 23. Because of this, I missed out on a lot of formative experiences, and this makes it almost impossible for me to relate to those around me. I often feel like I'm not really a person, like I'm some kind of anomalous entity that appeared from nothing with no past behind me and seemingly no future ahead. That 10-year gap is just a blur to me, I honestly can't pick out a single event. The only I got from it is weird interests and tastes in media that I have a lot of trouble opening up about, making it even harder to connect to people. And from the other direction, when people try to open up to me, I'm never able to relate to their interests. I'm just too far removed from the modern zeitgeist.\n\nThe thing is, I thought I was doing better. But now it all feels like it's falling apart. I started a new job about two years ago and, unlike my last job, I made a lot of casual work friends but I still couldn't form any real relationships. Whenever I suggested we do something outside work there would be some reason it couldn't happen. And the few times anyone did agree something would always come up, or they would conveniently \"forget\" despite me confirming the plans the day before. I would get \"vibed\" out of group conversations for my inability to relate, usually by suggesting I go work on something while everyone else continued to chat. But the real wake up call came on my birthday. I was falling into a bad depression and I turned to the person I thought I was the closest to only for them to get angry at me for slacking and putting all the work on them. And this after I had covered for them more times than I can count without them ever doing the same in return. They then told me that they would listen to my problems \"as long as it would get me to work harder\". This was on my birthday by the way, and the only thing I got was a store-bought cupcake from my manager, despite me having gotten several of my coworkers birthday gifts in the past. I felt so betrayed at first, but after giving it some thought I came to the realization that none of these people were actually my friends. They were in my life out of work obligation, not choice. So desperate I am for human connection that I was inflating these casual acquaintances into personal friends. And it was this overbearing desperation that was getting me shunned more than anything else. I'm so mortified by this realization that I have since become completely withdrawn. I am now in the worst depression of my life. It's hard to get out of bed, let alone make it through a workday. And I've completely lost my ability to work on any of my personal goals or hobbies.\n\nThe thing is, I honestly couldn't care less about what my coworkers think of me. I just want someone to talk to, that I can share things with. And I want a girlfriend, someone I can hold and love. I want to be able to be there for people and know that they're there for me. I want to be wanted, and I want to belong. And I have no idea how to help myself. I don't know where to go or what to do, especially with the world on fire like it is. And now on top of everything else, I don't know if I can even form normal relationships being as desperate as I am.\n\nToday was my day off, I spent the whole thing dreading tomorrow. I have no idea how I'm going to muster the strength to make it through another workday. I wouldn't say I'm suicidal, but I feel so cornered, I understand now how someone could be. I just want to get my life together before it's too late\n\n**e: Thank you to everyone for your responses, you really made a difference. I'm honestly feeling a lot better about things for the first time in over a week. And thank you to the people who messaged me through chat who I haven't been able to respond to yet. I need to get some sleep now, but I hope you all have a great night.**",

Feeling so profoundly out of step and behind everybody else, and it even extending as far as feeling like I don\u2019t belong anywhere and that I\u2019m ostensibly identityless. People also seem to baseline respect my good qualities, and nobody has ever admitted to disliking me to my face, but none of this truly matters to me because it\u2019s deeper connections I seek and am kept away from due to interests that just don\u2019t jive with those around me. Or even just my disposition. Much of the flow of conversations I overhear or am in the near vicinity of, I just don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m better but I just seem so incompatible. \n\nBut it sounds like you have a valid reason given the empty page that seems to be what your teens consisted of. Be kinder to yourself, and this means both testing limits and respecting them at appropriate times.",

She cheated on me in September and I\u2019ve been broken ever since. \n\nI had such a deep connection with her and she ruined it all in one night. I\u2019m terrified I\u2019ll never have that again. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll blink and be 30 already. I\u2019m like you; I can\u2019t accept the idea of being alone. I\u2019m an introvert with social anxiety but I love talking to people I\u2019m comfortable around and feel safe with. I need meaningful emotional connections with people to be happy but my social anxiety gets in the way at every turn. I need help but don\u2019t know how to ask, and time isn\u2019t slowing down.",

One is like a geriatric and a miserable old bastard and the other is funny and youthful and enjoys life. People are amazed when I tell them his age because he looks much younger.  \nThe point is you shouldn't be putting a label on yourself that you're old and life is over.  You still have at least 60 years of living to do.  \nYou're only 27. It's way to early to be thinking life is over and you're too old.  I'm 45 and while I have my responsibilities I still live life like I was when I was younger. I play video games, enjoy music and ride motocross and party and all that.  There's no rule saying you get to a certain age it's all slippers and cups of tea and toast and off to bed.  \nThe good thing is it's never too late to live.  You're a grown man so there's nothing stopping you from living how you want to live.",

I don\u2019t really have any close friends, mostly acquaintances. My only real luck I have socially is that I love my parents and sister deeply and only my parents return that love. My sister unfortunately hates me due to me not being a kind brother for most of our childhood. I turned around when I was 16 and she was 11, but it was too late it seems.\n\n26 and 27 is still young though, which is easy to forget. Look into your genealogy if you can and learn about your lineage. You might be of a long living family.\n\nAll you can really do is hope and try. I still try my best to get a hit with women, though usually through tinder and such, and mostly fail but at least I try. And there is no harm in hoping.\n\nIt is best for you and others to fight against the encroachment of loneliness and bitterness and have a fondness and encouragement of others. It will only serve you better in the end.",

I've talked to a girl named Alex for over year and 1/2 everyday and tried so hard to be there. She was my everything. Yesterday morning I decided to completely remove her from my life. And I'm having severe withdrawals, I would of never imagine id leave her but I feel like it's better this way for the both of us. She probably feels like I've abandoned her. And it kills me for doing it. But the friendship has became toxic. I love her and I think this is the best path for us both. Even though It feels like I've killed my soul. Now I feel super lost, and my will to care is gone. I'm just spamming music and trying to drowned my sorrows into working and pain. I have 1 person I can talk too and my brother is gone for 2 days, im not a big drinker I actually hate it. But tonight when he gets back I want to get drunk and forget. Life isn't easy. I work hard usually to the point I'm in pain. I care too much for others and get hurt. I try so damn hard and people see the nice guy as a rug. And it's just hard. Alex was the one person I could talk too. I don't want her to worry about me. She deserve better. So yes life hurts Soo much right now but I'm praying to whatever who will listen god? Aliens idk just anyone. Who will help me validate my decision was the right one. I dont want her to hurt. And ik I deserve better but. I'm scared I lost the onlhy person who gave a damn.

I\u2019ve been about self-improvement since my teens, but you can get stuck many times and not feel like you\u2019ve done much, and lose a lot of time to wallowing in short-lived pleasures. Find one thing you\u2019ve always wanted to do and throw yourself into it. Find a community, likely one on here with a lot of people that can sympathise and say \u201cI\u2019ve been there too, it\u2019s okay.\u201d I browsed reddit links from google for a year or two before finding relationship meeting stuff on here and made an account. I replied to a few posts, messages a few people, and without even genuinely whole-heartedly trying to chip away at myself, I\u2019ve been marvelled by what my mental marble stature has shaped into. \n\nIt\u2019s not the only way to find acceptance and possibility of growth, but we need people. Whether or not we know it, humans are social, we have desires, needs, wants, and those are shaped through conscious and unconscious reactions to what we experience. I hope this doesn\u2019t come off as preachy, but I wouldn\u2019t at all be the person I was today without all of the people who surrounded me. For good and for bad, I felt disconnected from those years, maybe not as strongly; but I can tell all the times when I got much better, and it was not from being alone and thinking about my fears of past experiences and things I missed. You may need counselling, I don\u2019t know your take on it, but those years are extremely formative and I\u2019d say anyone who had a strong disconnect during those years should consider it. There\u2019s many people like us around, you just have to show them what you feel and that you\u2019re there, and I\u2019d bet many will come to aid you in understanding and thoughtful words. \ud83d\udc4c",

I don't know what is up with the US but socializing and making friends here is tough and everyone I meet makes me feel like I'm not worth their time or energy. \n\nIt's made me really depressed as my late 20s are running out and I'm spending them like this. When I first left the US at 23, the loneliness, isolation, etc was a huge motivator. Now at 28 I feel like I am supposed to be \"adult\" and make more stable choices but feel like I can't because of how unhappy I am. We both still have time to live life a do exciting things though! Initially I was putting 30 as a cut off but I've extended it to 35 \ud83d\ude02 use this as an opportunity to save money and start crossing things off your bucket list when this is all over!",

So I often get talked down to and infantilized by them.\n\nI know I should be more active in my search for quality relationships. but I developed a lot of social anxiety in my 10 years as a shut in. Not so long ago I was too afraid to even order food at a restaurant. Putting myself out there without any support system to back me up is just so daunting. And I don't really know how to go about it. I downloaded discord for the other day and tried joining some servers. but I just ended up lurking, not sure what to say.",

Find a smaller one with a few member discord, reddit has a lot of them.

Some ppl go back to college at 50yrs old, some have careers at 20yrs old, and some lose it all at 35 yrs and have to start all over again. \n\nI used to hold myself to these set milestones, and all it ever did was tear me down bc I couldn't reach what the rest of my family did at the time they accomplished things. But eventually, I realized, ya know what? I have something they don't. I've actually made my own path. And bc it's my own as opposed to the path of society, I dont have to hold myself to their rules anymore. I make my own rules. I set my own standards. I judge myself, but I'll be damned if I ever allow anyone, including myself, to ridicule me for not living up to society's standards. \n\nAlso, I no longer judge others for not reaching these milestones by set ages so I've actually become more open-minded &amp; accepting of other lifestyles. I thought I was open before, but I wasn't really. Anyway, you're not old, far from it. You'll only feel old if you live with regret from the past.

Im insanely awkward around people (mostly girls), im too scared to take risks and try to socialize more.

I also never been in a relationship with a girl or even kissed one. Seeing my friends with their girlfriends and hearing their stories about sex, parties and so on, really makes me feel more insecure about myself and jealous. The only time i ever was somewhat close to a girl was i played League of Legends. She understood me like no one else, we could talk about anything and evertime i could hear her voice, my day would be amazing. I never met her or even saw a picture of her, but i still fell in love, thats how desperate i was. We dont talk anymore because of my dumb mistakes\n\nEven now as im writing this, i feel so empty and lonely. I haven\u2019t done anything productive and i feel like im a dissapointment. I dont even want to go out much anymore, and i feel like my friends are getting tired of me as well.\n\nI just had to get this of my chest, since i dont really have anyone to tell this to.

Don't get me wrong but in my book, a best friend is someone who cares about you, picks you up whenever you're down and listens to your bs all the time. Just because a few people go out for a coffee with you doesn't mean they have got your best interests at heart.\n\nThere have been times in the last 10 years wherein I have (thought) had best friends but it was only momentary and a huge part of it was me supporting the others, not the other way round. As soon as they got in a better position (going home for vacations during college, new job after college etc), they would completely forget about me and move on. During college, I used to think that people are spending time at home and I should let them enjoy but it continued further on even after college so much so that some people just don't bother staying in touch anymore. \n\nQuite often, I contemplate how no one truly loves me and how I don't have anyone to depend upon especially right now when I am going through the worst phase of my life.",

My thought is in a lot of ways our society is not a close knit community that takes care of each other. If anything you're dealing with absolute strangers for your whole life, other than family. It takes a unique kind of skill with constant practice to be able to deal with strangers, and we're meant to somehow try and wrest a satisfying social life out of that process. Somehow that's what has become normalized as \"social skills\". In another time and place in human history it would be very unnatural not to be an inclusive part of an initial tribe/community/group identity that you know for your whole life and constantly have threads of human connection with.\n\nThere's a way you can probably adapt to the situation you're facing, but don't get too hard on yourself.

I don't think there is any replacing that, it's something I just missed out on. \n\nI try to look at things through different lenses though. I think it's possible to delude yourself both with a positive and negative perspective. I think it's a definite reality that I missed out on many things, but maybe there are also some advantages to being in my position. Maybe going without has given me a better appreciation and understanding of what I want out of the relationships in my life. Maybe being a blank slate as an adult is an opportunity to define yourself as the person you want to be without having to redefine who you already were. \n\nIt's hard to say, being at such a liminal point in my life, but I think that believing there is no hope for the life I want is the only way to ensure there isn't. I realize this attitude might seem in stark contrast to my original post. But hearing from all these people who are struggling in the same way I am has been like looking in a mirror, and it's shown me how self defeating I can be.

And yet when it came to it I might as well been a lil boy stuck in a bathroom stall afraid to come out because of how scary the world is. I\u2019ve had sex before but nothing meaningful to remember or repeat. My life is going good and I\u2019m sure to be successful but my biggest worry is not having someone to share it with. I try talking to my friends and I know they mean well but there\u2019s only so much they can do. I long for the touch and love of a woman. One I can tell everything too and she\u2019d still give me a chance. Not to pity me. But understand and be patient with me even when I\u2019m at my worse. I understand you have to develop a friendship and I understand that love isn\u2019t instant. \n\nBut it\u2019s been five years if not more since I\u2019ve experienced any real affection and for about a month a coworker was interested in me and I let her in but my friends said I told her too much. And her desire for me has faded. To the point she doesn\u2019t want anything to do with me. When I feel close to you I want to be able to express everything to you. Even if it hasn\u2019t been long. I feel like connection should exist but the reality is that it doesn\u2019t. I pushed her away and now I have to see her and pretend I don\u2019t know know her. I don\u2019t regret it but I want to be better. I want to get over this mental block of not being able to communicate with women properly and appropriately. Idk when to say the right things. Or I say them when it\u2019s too soon or late. I say the wrong things constantly all when I should be saying the right things. \n\nI feel so backwards and alone. And I\u2019m sorry for this long comment but I want to understand better. I want to be better and normal. I want to be held by a woman with love for me and tell me it\u2019s gonna be okay and still blow her back out later. Treat her like a Queen. It seems crazy and beyond normal but that\u2019s how I am. Saying this won\u2019t do anything for me or help any of you but I did and it feels good too. \n\nTake care everyone.",

But being happy would be another story since I desire one, though I\u2019m sure it would take practice learning to be happy and accept not having one in my life. \n\nAnd I\u2019d say my life has been great and the women that came and gone have made it easier to deal with and understand. Unfortunately none have stayed due to my actions mostly, my inability to control my emotions labeling me as \u201cToo Much\u201d or \u201cToo Honest\u201d, and lack of understanding each one because no one woman is the same. I\u2019d understand the woman after she left and gone and would know what to do when it\u2019s too late. I believe men actually need women in their lives. Women don\u2019t need men, but that\u2019s my opinion and I\u2019d require someone to change my mind. I am sad sometimes knowing I could have been better for them but I just take as a lesson and the heartbreaks become easier to bear. \n\nAnd honestly it could very well be both. I see no way for it to be one or the other considering they are two sides of one coin. No one wants to experience the fear of being alone and being with anyone would suffice. It would not be healthy or ideal but to them it\u2019s better than being alone. Which I had many chances and still do to live my life that way with a woman but I want to be happy with that woman and her be happy with me. And then yes I want to enrich my life with someone whose thoughts and ideas would make things significantly better and different. I\u2019d adore it but I also fear losing my peace of being alone and if things happen not to work I\u2019d have to learn to be alone again and idk if I can handle that so I guess I\u2019ve chosen to push them away before they got too close rather than live with the fear of losing them one day because of my own imperfections. \n\nWomen today require so much just to be a thought in their mind and for me, I could easily fall in love just minutes after meeting one. And she doesn\u2019t have to have specific features, I\u2019d just feel deeply connected to her. And if that connection gets destroyed I fall apart. And putting myself back together has been rather easy as time goes but now I fear the older I get the harder it will be to recover and find that woman who would be worth taking that chance on. \n\nAt the end of the day, I have to keep learning and trying. More or less I need to man up. And being too honest I can work on. But being too much? I have so much love to give and I want to bestow on whoever I deem worthy to receive it. Even sometimes for ones who don\u2019t need or deserve it. I\u2019m just too easily caught up and love the idea of being in love so I take it further than required but it feels good to give that love. But I can\u2019t blame them for saying that or behaving the way they do, it can be overwhelming. Considering how often love is faked for ones person gain or agendas, I can\u2019t blame anyone for that. \n\nHope this helped. I almost never talk to anyone about this because it can be looked at as sad or depressing. But I have myself and I\u2019m learning to love me enough to keep going. And I think that will help in the long run. Whether I have a woman in my life or not, self love is becoming more prudent for me. And I advise everyone to do the same. Male or Female",

After this pandy is over I think I\u2019m going to try as hard as I can it might not work out but at least I fucking tried.",

Most gamers are men and I don't enjoy games targeted for them. Most writers are female, yes. And I'd loove to be friends with them, but I can't find any near me. \n\nI'm in the same boat as OP. I've never had a real deep relationship with someone, friend or otherwise and I don't know why. \n\nI think it's partly because I have trust issues and always think other people won't find me interesting, but that's been proven true so many times in my life. \n\nI've been bullied for being different and liking different things, I just sorta drew into myself and only talk to people when I need something from them or they need something from me. \n\nI really want to have a deep connection with someone.",

And from the other direction, when people try to open up to  me, I'm never able to relate to their interests. I'm just too far removed from the modern zeitgeist.\n\nI can absolutely relate to this part. I basically can't talk to people about anything that isn't politics and history anymore because everything that I actually like id just so far removed from what's trendy. The fact that my school is all-male, private and super tight-knit makes this even worse, because 70% of the people there are all basically the same kind of person, and I am just completely unable to relate to them.",

I always feel much better after I've been in the gym for a few weeks consistently.\n\n\\- Eat wholesome nutritious food... maybe also take a few supplements such as magnesium, multi, etc.\n\n\\- Improve your looks and style as much as possible... teeth, hair, clean well fitting clothes, etc.\n\n\\- Get on dating apps and at least get some experience... don't expect any results for the first year. Also there is a friend making option on Bumble, that will pair you up with other people who you can meetup with. I have social anxiety and get depressed a good bit... which makes me weird, so I get it, at least to some extent. You have to just take massive action with this and keep repeating it. The more you do so, the better you'll do with relating to people. You can also do meetup groups at [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) but may have to wait until pandemic dies down a bit. My goal is going to be to go to two a week.\n\n\\- Then I'd suggest getting a side hustle or going back to school (depending on your situation) and try to get your finances in order if they aren't. Work on improving credit with [creditkarma.com](https://creditkarma.com) and start paying off any debt/saving whatever you can.\n\nAll of it can be overwhelming, so just start out with one or two of them. Maybe start hitting the gym and try to meetup with some more likeminded people from apps like Bumble. I think FB or Google is also coming out with a friend making app. I need to do this as well, as I really don't have any friends.",

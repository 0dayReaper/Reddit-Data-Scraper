    "postText": "I've struggled socially all my days. I have never liked being the centre of attention or enjoyed large crowds. Full time anxiety has become a major problem of late.\n\nThe thing is, i used to enjoy being around certain people ( family, friends etc ). But i feel like somethings changed and people have less and less time for me. I used alcohol and drugs in the past to block out negative and intrusive thoughts. But im clean living these days.\n\nI just feel now like i can't connect more and more these days. And i'm terrified of growing old and bitter. I dont really have a point or question tbh. I just wanted to write this doen and get it out there. There are so many regrets of the past. If your reading this and your on the younger side. Please learn to love yourself before it becomes a life long flaw.",

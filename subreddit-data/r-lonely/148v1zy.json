I\u2019ve tried getting out and doing things and talking to people and it leads to nothing. I\u2019ve hoped something would change for years. I\u2019ve never really had friends and trying to make them now seems like a lost cause. I just can\u2019t do it anymore. Fuck it all",

Is your question about if people who care and who can deeply connect with you are on the Reddit in the first place to find or if people in the world at large care and are close friend material? Because if it\u2019s the latter, which is depressing and valid, maybe you should try to consider the first, that maybe you haven\u2019t found the right people yet but that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t out there. People you can connect with. Have you considered the ways in which you let yourself open up or the level to which you let yourself open up to others and or ways you might get involved ina hobby or classes were you can meet people in person with common interests and narrow it down to those you vibe with?",

Learn to enjoy being alone, accept that you feel depressed and lonely sometimes, but understand you'll feel happy again after it passes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKilling yourself now guarantees you'll die unhappy and alone.

    "postText": "I started taking Lexapro earlier this year\nmaking my dreams like movies. I don\u2019t really have bad dreams usually. I mostly have good dreams. I just feel so sad after waking up because it wasn\u2019t real. I had a dream that I had a partner before I woke up today. I felt so sad when I woke up because relationships of any kind are seemingly impossible for me to form and keep. I dream about everytime I sleep. It\u2019s unbearable.",

    "postText": "Anddd there\u2019s no punchline. My (29F) fianc\u00e9 (29F) dumped me. \n\nI didn\u2019t think things were great. But I didn\u2019t know she was absolutely miserable with me. Miserable enough to go talk to her ex. Who ironically cheated on her when they dated. And is now married with kids. \n\nWe had a bad fight about a week ago. I admit. I fucked up. I said some shit I shouldn\u2019t have. I apologized. Profusely. And am trying to do better. I begged her to stay. \nShe\u2019s done things before too. For example. When we met she was engaged and didn\u2019t tell me. Yeah hindsight, red flag. \nBut I loved her. I still do. \nAnd she left me. \nJust gave up. \n\nCalled my mom crying. She asked if there was someone else. How else could she give up a 3 year relationship so easy? \n\nI didn\u2019t believe it. I said no way. I trusted her with my soul. \n\nYeah well I was wrong. \nShe\u2019d been talking to her ex for at least 3 weeks prior. \n\nSo. I get cheated on. And told I made her that miserable. And I apologize. And do what I can. And beg and plead and she refuses to give me a chance to fix my behavior. \n\nI got a therapy appointment this week. \nI got started on medications today. \nI\u2019ve been to the gym twice so far. \nI\u2019m trying. I know I was wrong in the argument and it\u2019s late for me to try but I\u2019m trying now. \n\nAnd she just\u2026 doesn\u2019t care. \nI can forgive her for the cheating.\nBut she can\u2019t forgive me for what I said. \nShe won\u2019t accept my apology. Or changed behavior. \nI\u2019m just thrown away. \nAnd I\u2019m left sitting here in our house with our dogs in our bed alone. \nWondering why and if I had loved her better would it have been enough for her to stay.",

            "comment": "Our stories are pretty similar. Except I was very young and wayyy over my head. \n\nYou\u2019re making excuses for your ex. Your ex, on day one. Was untrustworthy, dishonest, and manipulative. You say you love her but is it because you\u2019re afraid of not living your life without her? Do you believe you can\u2019t do better? I don\u2019t know what your emotions are telling you when you look at her but you just have to realize that she is a bitch. She is a bitch not only to you, but those around her. A parasite who latches onto its next victim.\n\nWhat should piss you off the most is that she believes she\u2019s done no wrong and can treat you like the entire problem. How can you not see how miserable being with this person was? \n\nI don\u2019t care what argument you had with her. One day you\u2019ll realize that this argument was the one that saved you from many years down the line. \n\nI\u2019m sorry to hear that this person wasn\u2019t who you wanted them to be, but you can be there for yourself now. Ask yourself, why you want to be with this person. Why do you want to be devalued? \n\nPlease give yourself the respect you deserve.",

            "comment": "Honest opinion, I don't know if you need or want to hear it, but I think you COULD need someone to say it:\n\nDrop her. Because even if you could convince her somehow to return, you would never have a guaranty she won't do it again. Or you would so often feel the nagging feeling she might be cheating again, even if she is not, you would always have that thought in the back of the head.\n\nWhat you can do: Keep up the therapy appointments, but instead of changing your behavior, learn to let her go. Also keep the gym up. Even if you tune down the amount of workout you do, can't hurt to do a bit of fitness right?\n\nFinally: Grieve but don't cling. You will need time to process, to digest and to learn of your mistakes. Some point in the future you might find that your sadness has ended, might turned into anger and once you notice that, let go of that and just begin to forget. \n\nAnd if you are a bit lucky, you might have found someone more fitting to you by the time your anger ends, be who ever it will be.",

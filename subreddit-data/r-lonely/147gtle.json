    "postText": "For context, I'm (M29) and I've been depressed since I was 14. In all those years, I never told a single person about any of my problems because people never seemed to care for me.  I figure if I don't matter, then my problems don't matter either, so why bother telling anyone? After 15 years of a near-endless cycle of doing nothing but sleeping and playing video games, I'm at a point where I know i'm going to die alone and there's nothing I can do about it. \n\nThe few things I enjoy in life don't feel the same as they used to. Everything I do at this point is just a distraction from the fact that my existence was completely pointless. I've lost the will to want to get better because I know I'm a lost cause. The thought of opening up to anyone at all makes my skin crawl, but fuck it, I'm really high and venting through a keyboard seems more bearable than directly talking to someone.",

From my experience, having a female friend that is truly plutonic is the best source of who to talk with your feelings. Most girls have a natural nurturing side to them that even if they don\u2019t say a lot you can feel safe, as well as it eliminates feeling demasculated going to another guy and feeling they just wouldn\u2019t get it or you\u2019d be judged. \n\nI\u2019d also recommended getting out in nature. Regularly spending time outside does wonders on the mind. \n\nI hope the best for you and I\u2019ll say a prayer for you.",

            "comment": "Dear friend\n\nI also have no one. The one person I see every day, my father, hates me to no end, and although my system does get something from his presence, it also gets a lot of turmoil and torment.\n\nI never could make friends and when befriended, could never keep them. There's a ton of evidence to support autism but I don't have diagnosis.\n\nI'm a few years older than you but relate to your experience a lot. Including feelings of wanting to end things, which I gathered from one of your other posts.\n\nThat said, I want to say that firstly, it's actually OK to feel all of those things.\n\nYou see, everyday I experience very painful emotions, and often I'm not able to do anything during it. My life is far from OK and I'm essentially dependent on my parents, and now have real problems in getting another job. I've lost all motivation for most things that used to interest me before.\n\nBut inspite of all of this, I'm still grateful to be alive, and although it's hard, I am able to genuinely give thanks for all of the minor things and comforts I do have. I couldn't do that before.\n\nMy daily joys consist of the occasional film, lots of music from radio and a small playlist, and a bit of reddit or youtube when I need to appear occupied and busy.\n\nThis sounds like a miserable existence but I'm actually happier, and more OK than I have ever been.\n\nAs frequently as I encounter moments of torment or turmoil, I have feelings of tear jerking, hair raising, melting joy for the simplest things like music and a film.\n\nI never had a therapist. I tried antidepressants for a short bit but it was a regrettable experience for me and sent me over the edge because I was using it as a crutch like everything else.\n\nWhat happened for me was that builtin natural healing process in the human system, that happened during isolation in destitution and homelessness.\n\nThis is why people talk about needing to hit rock bottom. The real reason why is because that is usually where you automatic, builtin healing mechanisms kick in because you've got no more fight left to put up and no where else to run away to.\n\nAlso, it can be very helpful to find a good listening ear. Something about carefully articulating what is bothering you and your feelings, accurately and truthfully and openly with brave self-honesty, is incredibly healing. One way I did that is talking to chatGPT for lack of a therapist. But I also tried the free volunteer driven services on 7cups which was partially successful, but mostly not. If you need an ear then you can DM if you want, and I'll do my best. But can only reply when I have an opportunity to type and can't always do that.\n\nIf you'd like to know more about what I believe changed my life, I've described it in a post here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/user/sad\\_robot\\_101/comments/146qpqi/human\\_nature\\_101/](https://www.reddit.com/user/sad_robot_101/comments/146qpqi/human_nature_101/)",

They're exhausting to me can only handle about two or three hours max.then I don't see them again for a few months. Just have to find common ground. Come out of your shell. I know it's scary and shit. But it's either that or suffer in silence. The only person that is really gonna help you is you. Get medicaid,go to a doctor get meds. And finding meds that work well for you is trial and error. Be honest with the medical professionals. You don't like your doctor, pick a new one. You can't just sit on your ass. Same with finding friends, trial and error",

I tell myself that other people have more important problems than mine, and that mine aren't worth voicing. If it's trauma, you need to address it with a professional. I have put it off for awhile, and it keeps coming back to haunt me every so often. Which typically leads to a spout of depression and isolation. \n\nEveryone has problems, you have problems I don't have, and I'm sure I have some you don't have. Though, both of our problems are valid, and deserve to be heard by someone willing to help, or at the very least, offer comfort. If they are reoccurring, like a chip on your shoulder, address them sooner than later. No one deserves to carry baggage their whole life that weighs them down. Feeling like they aren't worth being talked about. Work through it now so that you can thank yourself later. I hope you see this, and I hope this helps.",

I stopped for a second and thought why, and then it hit me: all the work I had resisted had helped me in ways i didn\u2019t understand but I do now. It felt like I was digging, planting seeds and watering it everyday to no use. With time and patience, those fruits nourished my mental and emotional state.",

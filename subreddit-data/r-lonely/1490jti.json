    "postText": "A couple of weeks ago I turned 24 and it got me thinking of what I have done in my life, what I still have left to do, and most importantly, the people who have been there, the people I want there in the future, and all in all, I feel like I really have no meaningful relationships. I have always thought of myself as someone who is pretty easy going and mostly chill, which is why I have never had any real problems starting friendships, or just talking to people in general, however, I\u2019ve noticed that most of the times, those friendships don\u2019t last long or have really any profound level to them, the story always cycles to the same old boring conversations with no meaning to them until we reach a point where we just stop talking altogether. I know its selfish to think that others have a responsibility to check in on me, but I can\u2019t help but notice how other people have people who seek them and truly worry about them, that has never been the case for me, my inbox is always empty except for a couple meme groups I am a part of even though I occasionally text people just to start a conversation about anything, but most of the time I feel like I just get ignored so I have stopped trying. I have always been the friend that rarely gets invited to hang out, the one who can go for months unnoticed by everyone else, I always thought that that was just normal to not make myself think that there is something exceptionally wrong with me, but lately I just can\u2019t keep ignoring the fact that nobody really cares about me. Whenever I have remotely touched on this subject through social media, without fail, there is always someone from my contact list who comments on how I am just being dramatic, and that people really care for me, but it just does not feel that way ever. Maybe I am being overly dramatic, but this is something I have been feeling over the last couple of years to the point where I just want to get away from everyone and stop trying to pretend like I have friends. Whenever I\u2019ve been vocal about this the response is just getting ignored or even being mocked, just felt like writing about this to someone who might care.",

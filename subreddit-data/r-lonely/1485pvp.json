    "postText": "Hello! 26yo extroverted woman. It was very hard to be alone at first (still difficult) but I think I've gotten used to it, at least it doesn't make me feel sad anymore. \nI'd like to chat with someone on a daily basis (if possible) we could talk about anything. I'm always down for a talk and for learning new things! \nInterests are: painting, drawing, singing, dancing, outdoor activities; hiking, running, jogging. \nI love almost all kinds of genres of music and I'd love to keep discovering new songs, tunes and add them to my playlists. \nIf you're 25-35 and interested please hit me up! \nAs you can see, English is not my first language lol but I'm sure this won't be a barrier (I hope)\nHave a good day!",

    "postText": "I have been trying to look for a boyfriend for more than a year now with no luck. Due to my type being white boys and living in Southeast Asia, I can\u2019t find a proper guy without them having some red flags. I just feel so lonely. I see my friends all having boyfriends and they are happy. I just feel depressed that I couldn\u2019t find one. At first I blame myself that Im too fat and ugly or Im not submissive and flirty like other girls. Now I just blame circumstances. I feel so stuck and hopeless.",

            "comment": "Human interaction is inherently a multi person sport. You are thus partially responsible for your outcomes and partly not responsible for them. And if you start to seriously believe that any human comes devoid of actions or signals you'll misinterpret then most likely it's that you think too highly of your ability to relate to others. Most red flags are just your own scars and a projection of the actions of a past person onto the new person. The new person then gets treated unfairly based more on your past than the action in question.",

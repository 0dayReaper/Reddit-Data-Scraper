    "postText": "Hi everyone I am 36F from Manchester, I am looking for a genuine friend to share our lives and common interests, I would like to be over 35 years old.\r  \n\r  \nI am an outdoor enthusiast, I love travelling, I can travel to different places and experience the local culture that I have not been exposed to before, I can also experience all kinds of people and their different lifestyles, at the same time I can also try something new to me, you will come back from the trip and you will find that you will gain a lot, the process is a bit tiring but it is all worth it.\r  \n\r  \nI am a lonely person and I don't have any friends to listen to me, I hope to find a friend who will support and accompany me, if you are also looking for a friend please contact me.\r  \n",

However, there's a cottage industry now of girls that seem 'accessible' aka 'within your league'. Really insidious evil stuff.",

Like each and every time you gon show a weakness, be sure that someone will trie to take advantage of your it is sad. This why we don't have the guts to show emotions no more. U\nYou'd be like \"oh someone going through the same hardship than me, I'm going to give an helping hand, as I wish someone would do for me\" just for you to discover that you've been played like a fiddle. \nIt is sad , because it shows us that the philosophy stating \"together ape strong\" stand no more and \"you better close your eyes to the sufferings around you\" is new way to go.",

    "postText": "So, I\u2019m 20, it\u2019s been just over two years since I graduated high school. A year ago my girlfriend dumped me over text, which is probably why I have abandonment issues.\n\nI have a few friends but their almost always busy.\n\nSimply put, I really don\u2019t have anyone I can hang out with anymore. And I\u2019m single now. The problem is that I\u2019m no longer in school so I really can\u2019t talk to new people.\n\nI do have a job and have begun to befriend a co-worker, but I\u2019m scared to ask if she wants to hang out platonically out of fear of being seen as flirting/wanting to hang out romantically because it seems like literally everyone has a partner.\n\nJust\u2026 argh. I\u2019m lonely, and scared to talk to new people in fear of being seen as asking them out.",

I have made a lot of friends this way (online only, but it\u2019s still helpful). I always seem to find people I like but they live far enough away to make visiting difficult. \n\nOther than that I legitimately don\u2019t know. It takes time together in the same physical space to make friends the organic way. That\u2019s why we all made them at school, and why many people meet their friends at work.\n\nAs a side note, my pet theory is that the reason why so many people report feeling lonely these days is that social media and other online connectivity between people has caused it. I lived a good portion of my life prior to the existence of social media (but not the internet) and back then you would either visit your friends or call them on the phone. Connecting through technology is easy but highly superficial and rarely an adequate replacement for physical IRL social and emotional support.",

This also affects the moderation of the site and there's going to be a lot of spam and bots that are going to get through the spam filter that the automods put up because automoderation also uses the API. \n\nThis is my understanding of it though. You can just Google Reddit blackout for more info.",

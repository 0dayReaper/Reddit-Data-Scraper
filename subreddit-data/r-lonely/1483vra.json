    "postText": "Hey! I've been feeling really lonely for over a year now and I just feel like I need to talk to someone about it. I know it's kinda sad but I really don't trust anyone enough IRL to talk to them about my feelings. For reference I'm a teenager, Male, and I'm bordering on Obesity. I'll split this up into two parts, the social life part and the more personal part.\n\nSocial life: \n\n In school I have a 3 friends that I talk on a daily basis and I know practically the whole grade however it all feels so fake. I'm \"chill\" with like 30 people but when I get home I just don't have anyone at all to talk to. Like seriously I don't talk to a single soul except for my family when I'm outside of school. I'm not especially \"close\" to anyone and I don't feel comfortable opening up or even sharing the slightest bit of personal information that might make vulnerable in any way whatsoever. I wouldn't even consider opening up to my parents or family (except for my cat) and I don't even know why. I just don't feel safe around people anymore and it sucks because I really want someone that I can talk to but I just can't find anyone. I used to try to be part of friend groups and strive to make friends but I got shut down every time I tried. I don't want to say I'm traumatized because I feel like that's a word that carries significant meaning and shouldn't be thrown around lightly but like I've had 3 friend groups since elementary school and all 3 ended in an extremely negative way that left me hurt and alone for several months if not year(s). Ever since then I've kind of closed myself away from other people. I guess the main event that triggered me to write this is when I was on the bus, half heartedly talking to one of my only friends when7 kids that usually aren't on my bus came on and sat next to us. Turns out they were all going to go hang out at my friends house. And I guess this was the first time I had ever witnessed a real social event that featured more than just two or three people and I suppose it really got me thinking. Why don't I do that? Why don't I have all of these friends and buddies that I can hang out with. And don't get me wrong, good for my friend. I'm not saying that I'm jealous of him specifically but I just feel like a piece of shit now knowing that I am weird, and that everyone else DOES hang out except for me. And I don't even know what's wrong, I'm academically smart (straight A's, Honors and Advanced Classes, etc...), I always make people laugh when I'm around them, I try to be social but for some reason I can just never really maintain a friendship. And I know that some people don't even have the one or two friends I have but it still gets lonely when your all alone in your room, no one to talk to and seeing all these people from school actually have a life. I guess it all went wrong when my fatass didnt fucking socialize during quarntine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore Personal Part: \n\nI feel like I can't be myself around other people. Naturally I'm a rather reserved person who enjoys math and science but in school I've had to put on a facade just to fit in even a little. I come to school and pretend like I'm happy even though most of the time I feel awful, lonely, and sad. Other people in my school would describe me as \"happy\", \"a little detatched\", \"friendly\", \"approachable and extroverted\". But like, I'm not any of those things except for friendly. It all just feels so shallow, the people who I sometimes talk to I can never engage in a converstation longer than 5 minutes before they just leave to go talk to someone else. I don't know, **TLDR** I kinda hate myself, I can't talk to anyone about it and I have no real friends or anyone I can open up to.  It's come to a point where I don't even seek out meaningful relationships or even attempt to bring up my feelings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI put a (1) in the title because I might write more (trust me, I have more to say) in the future. But for now, thank you for listening to me. I already feel a little better finally getting some of this stuff off of my chest. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

    "postText": "Our first date went well, she put my hand on her left thigh and we had fun. \n\nSo I texted a girl about setting up a 2nd date after last Thursday on Saturday. She said she had a lot of fun but had plans the rest of the weekend... I then texted her next week about making a plan to go to a hookah bar this friday where she said she wanted to go later during our first date. She said 'I'm not sure if I can this friday. I'll get back to you about it.' I then said a few hours later, 'Sure, but if another day works better let me know. But can't do this Saturday.'\n\nDoes she want to go out with me? And does she like me?",

I don't know what emotions are running through you right now, but the best you can do is responsibly relay those emotions to her and let her know how you wish for her to respond. I wouldn't fault her for having life get in the way, but I also wouldn't begrudge someone for wanting a relationship with a more available person.",

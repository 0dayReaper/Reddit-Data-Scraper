(meth, cocaine, heroin, Xanax, etc) Anyways, I just got prescribed suboxone, a drug that keeps you from craving heroin and other opioids. It helps me get out of bed, eat more, feel less depressed and anxious, socialize more, and get this\u2026.kills my sex drive! I\u2019ve always been socially awkward and inept, not that good looking, terrible with women, (only been with 1) and I always hated the fact that I was the only one missing out of love and intimacy. This stuff is a godsend, I don\u2019t care about it at all! I can talk to any girl now without any care in the world!",

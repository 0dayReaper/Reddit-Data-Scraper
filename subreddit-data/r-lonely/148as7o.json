    "postText": "Its a pretty fucked up way of achieving some twisted sense of clairvoyance lol... if yk what 'it' is. But yeah I see the end so clearly and often I'm almost certain everything now I feel has dissolved into a joke. Except I know when I get there it won't be funny...it's crucial I stay committed to the end. What enjoyable now is realizing how fragile life is. How ridiculous. How once you lose your attachments to life it genuinely becomes a joke. Beyond it all though I'm tired so I can't afford to get hung up on it. This needs to end or I really will lose my shit lol and with that the option...I guess I'm close. I feel near close to nothing. No fear, hatred, guilt, shame, confliction, amusement or self satisfaction. Just a goal I'll see the end to.",

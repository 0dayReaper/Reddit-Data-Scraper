Been feeling lonely, sad, and sometimes even angry about my life. I see so many people who have happiness just handed to them whether that be wealth, relationships, opportunity to travel with others, career etc. Rarely a dull moment in their life &amp; a life just filled with fun, joy, and relationships.  People just living their best life &amp; don\u2019t even know the struggle of being single, \u201csocially awkward\u201d, lonely or depressed. ",

            "comment": "I'd answer that as a serious question. If you're seriously asking then my answer is you set your own meaning and determine your own happiness in life. You choose which challenges are active challenges, those that you're seeking to conquer, and which are passive challenges, those that you don't want and didn't ask for. Your quest to achieve goals is your meaning for being. As for the happiness in your life, there is no one prevailing way to accrue happiness. Some find it through seeing the pain of others and the relief of knowing that they have been spared that pain. Some find it through seeking to enjoy their hobbies to the fullest extent. Some find it through finding moments here and there that act as an emotional high in almost the same way a drug addict uses drugs to achieve a high. \n\nAll that is to say that you're only fully living if you're happy to challenge the imperfection that is life and to find hope in other imperfect people. If you're alone, then thinking critically about what you do wrong helps. If you're attracting the wrong people, then you should question what attracts you to those people. And most of all, understand that the qualities you want in others are almost always self serving. \"Be nice\" \"be helpful\" \"be reliable\" can equally be viewed as \"I want someone who won't question me\" \"I want someone who makes themselves available to help me whenever I want/need it\" and \"I want someone who will continue to do for me over a long period of time without anger or resentment.\" The closer you rely on someone to be perfect, the further you will find yourself from finding anyone.",

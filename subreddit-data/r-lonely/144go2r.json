    "postText": "This is something i have been wanting to tell for a while. Finally decided to put my thoughts into words. I have been wanting to post on subs just to find someone whom i can chat with on the long term and usually end up mpty hands. Which doesnt come as a surprise but yeah does ache that i am not able to make a connection.\n\nIt definitely will be nice to have someone to chat with have someone you can reach out to at any time. I dont know if this seems more like a rant or resching out to people who feel the same pr would like to form a connection.\n\nI am here if anyone do want to reach out or if yall want to leave a piece of advise in the comments. I\n\nI hope each and everyone whether you reach my.post or not have a lovely day ahead.",

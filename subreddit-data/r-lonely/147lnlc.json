    "postText": "\"put yourself out there!\" Trust me, I have tried many times.. every time I end up going to public places I just start to feel more lonely, seeing the happy couples, groups of friends, and families.. damn it. I already know I'm not capable of having any of that. At least when I'm at home gaming, reading, or watching something I don't feel as bad. It's worse to feel lonely when you're visually seeing everything that you're missing out on.",

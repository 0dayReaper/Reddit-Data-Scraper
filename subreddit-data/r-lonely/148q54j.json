    "postText": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have no friends at all, have never had a GF, and have lost all social skills. Every time I go for work or school, I check social media and see couples joking, cuddling, kissing, and engaging in other activities that excite me despite the fact that it seems I'll never be in one. Love has always been my first priority, despite the fact that I am just 19 years old. But even though people tell me they love my personality, they hardly ever show romantic interest in me, and I've finally realised that unless this changes,I won't discover love. Despite having a generally appealing appearance, the chances of you finding love are extremely slim. \n\nPeople do care about appearances, despite what they may claim, and far more so than they do about someone's personality. I don't think I'll ever be loved back since I lack the traditionally alluring looks that would entice someone to want to date me.",

And I promise people will be less picky once are in a certain age group. Just practice charisma for confidence. Otherwise try online dating. People will be less concerned about your looks and after dating for some time online and FaceTiming, and you meet irl, they don\u2019t care about your looks. This shouldn\u2019t be a reason to end your life.",

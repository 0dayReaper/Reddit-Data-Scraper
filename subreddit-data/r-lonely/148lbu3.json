Like I am the only one here and everyone is looking at me laughing. So I keep my thoughts to my self and find my self feeling more alone.",

The climate is getting worse, the planet is becoming less inhabitable, and civilized humans are so deeply afflicted by our soul sickness that we refuse to even pump the brakes on the leviathan death machine. Instead, we rationalize our insular, materialistic lives of excess and waste as we watch the world burn (literally) and the rich get richer.\n\nSeriously, if you have all of that in your life and you\u2019re posting on here you probably either need professional psychological help or deep down you are feeling that thing that I think most of us know, but few are willing to talk about\u2026that we are doing things terribly wrong and these are not the lives we are meant to lead.",

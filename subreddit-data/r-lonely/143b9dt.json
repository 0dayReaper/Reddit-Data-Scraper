If nobody will sleep with you then you at the very least have every right to satisfy your own urges when you need to. To then hate yourself for even giving yourself that much is just going to tie you up in knots further than you already are and its unnecessary.",

I briefly quitting porn earlier this year because I was preoccupied with my crush but now that that has fizzled significantly and my mental health is pretty low I went back to PMO every few days. I don\u2019t like it because while I was off porn I was thinner, healthier and more confident but where I\u2019m at in life right now it\u2019s one of the only things I have. I know that if/when my life starts improving I could double down by quitting P at least, possibly the MO too and hopefully that confidence will return.",

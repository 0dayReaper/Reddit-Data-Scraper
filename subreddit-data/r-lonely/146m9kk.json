I never felt good enough to have someones attention and it always caused me to distance myself from anyone who would even try to get close to me. Even if someone did break through that barrier it was only a matter of time before I would find excuses to push them away and tell myself that everybody secretly doesn\u2019t like me, they only keep me around because they feel bad for me, until I pushed everyone away. Now I think it really is true that I deserve to be alone and it is what it is. I\u2019m just thinking about how I could have done things differently in my life.",

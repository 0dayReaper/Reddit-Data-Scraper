    "postText": "I'm 28/m. Just got back after 10 months of solo travel. It's been nearly 2 months since I've come back home. Yeah home. A loving family but one that lacks communication. Friends? None. For a very long time.\n\nI have this very deep pain and longing for a connection. I'm currently feeling lost. A hug would be nice. It feels like there's a weight on me due to the feeling of not belonging. Or no one that understands. My attention has become so restless. ALWAYS searching to be occupied with anything to not have to face this hole in me. Sex, food, music, drugs, .. anything. It's all just a way to avoid this feeling.\n\nBetween feeling lonely, finding a new job, and post travel depression, I feel extremely isolated.\n\nWould be nice to chat with someone to help take my mind off things. Something exciting that's going on? What you're looking forward to? Please help.",

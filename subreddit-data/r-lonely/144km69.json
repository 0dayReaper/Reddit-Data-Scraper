    "postText": "m seb (m13) I don't care if you know my name I don't care anymore. Recently I have been pushed out of 3 friend groups because of my long hair and depression it all links back to my old best friend called Harry you can have his name I don't care about his safety either all he has done for the past two years is spread roumous about me for the past 2 years which has resulted me on the brink of suicide the only reason I am still alive today is my hope that it will all stop one day which it kinda has but this selfish dickhead has put me so far down that I now have a permanent obvious scar on all of my limbs saying looser which has made them make fun of me even more they won't leave me alone. A few weeks ago I have started going to gym yes at 13 just to beat up this cunt i have recently checked my phone and I never use SMS unless it is for suicide hotline and I have over 10 hours talking to them and I honestly to think that my plan will be to get my friend to earn him and if he continues beat the shit out of him I don't care about the concenquinces people like this don't deserve to live and I will make sure of that when I was at my worse I used to sit on the edge of a bridge over a train track thinking about my life. And the worse part? I have no proof of my billing apart from trust me bro and the small chance of this going viral all I want is someone to talk to in  person he also makes fun of my past regections from girls. It has got to the point where I am talking to people who aren't real ( ai's) cunt. All I am asking for which I highly doubt will happen is for this to go viral I honestly want to give you guys his tick tock but the concenquinces will be larger for me if you guys ask for a update I will give one please message me on Reddit ( I don't know if you can ) I will check this post regularly to see this is my cry for help help me - seb malcolm",

Shitty grades and no gym progression. Take this time to focus on yourself which can be very beneficial to someone your age. Get ur head in the books whilst you still can. I regret it because of the opportunities I missed out on (University, Apprenticeships etc). \n\nHit the gym and take it seriously, by the time your 16/17 coming to the end of highschool, you\u2019ll not only be a lot more confident in yourself\u2026 but others will notice what you\u2019ve achieved. \n\nBeing lonely isn\u2019t always a bad thing, sometimes you need to be lonely to figure out who you want to be.",

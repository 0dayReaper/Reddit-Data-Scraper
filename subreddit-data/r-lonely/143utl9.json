To want your body pressed against a beautiful woman's body. Your lips wet with her tongue inside your mouth. \nThe need is real! To want to undress her and watch her clothes fall to the floor. \nThe need is real! To touch her caressing every part of her.\nThe need is real! Rubbing your hands across her body.\nThe need is real! To taste her, her mouth, her breast, between her thighs. \nThe need is real! To become one with her joined in unbridled passion.\nThe Need is Real!!!\nBut knowing the woman you married doesn't desire that need...Hurts to the core!!",

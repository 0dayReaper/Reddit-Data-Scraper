Just for bit of background, I was a loner for most of my high school years, reason being that like most is that I couldnt fit in. But throughout my journey of making friends during my time in university. Its not easy to say the very least, there was a considerable amount of effort that I had to put in to cultivate friends who desired me. Ill give you an example, I have a \u201cfriend\u201d who I know for 2\nyears, for this specific person I had to initiate many conversations first, whether it was text or in person. And also invited him many times to hang out. Almost like someone who never texts you back and you think they\u2019re not really your friend, that people on social skills subreddit hate. But the strange part was somewhere around the time, as we hung out more and more, he started to give me more attention and started to initiate hangouts more. Yes, while it is nice that someone desires me. There was this cost and that was my time, effort and energy. Not to mention, having to maintain this friendship. It can be very exhausting, especially if you like being alone. So what I\u2019m trying to get here is, it is not all rainbows and sunshine, like you cannot have the good without the bad. Just a food for thought",

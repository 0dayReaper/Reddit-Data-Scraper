    "postText": "i have started to crush hard on this guy at my job. He\u2019s about 16 years older than me we work in construction I am a girl he is a man just to make that clear it all started because they work in a hoist elevator and I make these like puzzles for people to go to do I thought it be fun because I get kind of bored sometimes in there and he started to do them all the time and he would get the answer first and then he was put in a different area of the building we working on the construction I didn\u2019t see him and then he came back and the day I saw him he was like hey how have you been? i said im good! where have you been? He\u2019s a guy been in the basement of the building I was like oh that sucks and I don\u2019t know I felt like somethings just clicked in my mind and he smiles a lot to me and I like wave at him and all these things like that but I\u2019m on sure if I should give him my phone number or not. I started thinking about him more and more and I didn\u2019t see him on Friday and this is Sunday now and tomorrow I\u2019m thinking myself I should just write my number on a piece of paper and be like hey text me or something I\u2019m 36 and he\u2019s 53 so I know I don\u2019t know I just need some feedback on this I think he\u2019s interested",

And it scares me. It really scares me. It scares me. I'm scared to be alone with myself today. It scares me..\nI HATE YOU. I HATE WHAT HOU DID TO ME. I HATE WHAT YOU STILL DOING TO ME EVEN THOUGH YOU LONG GONE. I HATE HOW YOU USED ME. I HATE THAT YOU TOOK ALL OUR FRIENDS AWAY FROM ME. I HATE HOW YOU USED UP ALL MY MONEY. MONEH MENT FOR MY KIDS. AND YOU JUST GO ON WITH YOUR LIFE. I HATE WHAT IT HAS TURNED ME INTO. I HATE YOU AND MYSELF FOR IT. BUG MOSTLY I HATE MYSELF. I HATE THAT I'M BROKEN AND STUCK AND LONELY. I SHOULDN'G BE THE ONE THAT ALONE, UTTERLY ALONE... so fucking alone.\n\n\nI shouldn't be alone today... I'm scaring myself and I can't breath, and nothing will change, because I'm stuck in this life I allowed myself to get stuck in. WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE ME?",

    "postText": "Like what is it supposed to be based on? Should I also be a confident basketball player when I know from experience that I'd get schooled at the local park.\n\nNo matter what you try, the same thing happens to you over and over and over throughout life whenever you try talking to anyone you like, and you're so SO tired of having to cut off every person you've ever had feelings for with the same bitter heartache at the end of the story. And then you're supposed to fucking go out there with some swag as if ThIs TiMe iTs GoInG tO bE dIfFeReNt!1!\n\nAnd without fail for 30+ years, every girl who SAYS they want to hang out with you, flakes out time after time after time. And when you complain about it to anyone on the internet, they all just go \"I dunno, maybe it's YOU! Ever think of that?\" as if the idea never crossed your mind before. That's like the thing you've done everything in your power to make sure that it isn't you and people just can't wait to confirm your deepest fear with very minimal understanding of the matter.\n\nThis is why I became a strip club addict. This is why I started paying for female companionship. Because there's no guarantee that whoever I like won't just do more of the same. I have to be able to have positive experiences with women I'm attracted to and society has made clear to me that the only path for me to get that is by paying for it. Granted, that often leads to other kinds of disappointments. Like the girls you pay put in minimal effort to make you feel connected to them or make the stuff you do together actually enjoyable. But with some trial and error, I've had better experiences and less heartache doing that than trying to have a normal dating life. And I know it's not supposed to be this way.\n\nLast year, I stopped paying for it because I realized, I need to build up my bank account. So I decided, I'd take the hit for a year, maybe get my ducks in a row and try and re-start dating normally again, but I'm again met with the same flaky behavior from everyone, and I've learned not to overreact when texting the people I make plans with, not to express any frustration towards them and if it's time to move on because their behavior isn't going to change, just do so quietly. But holy fucking shit am I tired of moving on again and again and AGAIN. With people who say they can't wait to hang out with me, are willing to make all the plans, but at the end of the day always have a fresh new excuse waiting.  And it's every single person I've ever liked who has ever shown any interest back. Is this just me going through this? \n\nI don't think every girl is this unreliable. I think women who have a lot of options, decide they have to be unreliable to somebody to spend time with somebody else. And I'm never at the top of anyone's priority list, so I am doomed for this to happen to me apparently until the end of fucking time. So at the end of the year, I'm probably just going to go back to paying for it with a fresh new bank account and extract what minimal emotional and sexual satisfaction I can get out of that without ever knowing what a real 2-way loving connection will ever feel like.",

Mine comes from crippling apathy and nihilism and j wouldn't wish that on most people. \n\nIt's a shame I can't really contribute to your problem but at least I'm one more person that can sympathise.",

And just like there are different forms of fitness, there are different forms of confidence. I could be really good at boxing and calisthenics but terrible at marathons or lane swimming. You can be really confident at one thing but not something else. I think it's great if you wanna learn new things because self-improvement is a lifelong lesson. But no matter how good you are at something, someone else will always be better at than than you. And you'll always be better at that thing than someone else. I don't think confidence is a thing that once you've got it, you've got it. It can change over time. You can lose it or make it stronger. Ultimately, it's your attitude and how well you know yourself that determines real confidence. There's a lot of stuff I agree with from the \"alpha male\" community but I think a lot of that is just marketing too and overrated. Don't be bitter or blame others. Live your life for you and no one else.",

If you really take the time to think about how each person has their own unique life path with millions of twists and turns that affects their behavior and perceptions, then it\u2019s impossible for their actions to solely determine your self worth.",

I'm trying to learn how to quit procrastinating, be more productive, be more complete so that I seem to be a more worthwhile option to somebody hopefully.

Ranting out of frustration sure but if you have a right to be frustrated and say your peace then how can you say I don't. \n\nAlso it really kinda sounds like you're saying that because men statistically cheat more than women, no women should ever date a man and we should all just live out the remainder of our sad lives (both men and women) without another date. To me that sounds sadder than being cheated on and, if you don't mind me saying, kinda extreme. \n\nI don't doubt that men cheat more, but I still don't know if it's significantly more, and I have to question if that means no matter who you meet you should never trust any of them...that's kind of a harsh, scorched-earth take there. I know my last reply was coming from a place of anger and frustration but there is really no intent to do anyone any harm. You getting after me with the condescending name calling was pretty interesting though. Looks like we both have a lot of unresolved baggage around the matter.",

A reason I see crop up over and over again with women here is how they can\u2019t just hang out or chill with guys because they always want more and ghost when they don\u2019t get it.  I can definitely buy women preemptively backing out when it feels like it\u2019s going that route over and over again.  Guys need to do better.  Then we\u2019ll stick around.",

I realized I don't want sex with someone who isn't going to be enthusiastic about it so that sort of stuff has to happen naturally. Generally if I get to kiss someone, I'm thrilled because that's pretty rare in itself. But it feels more and more like the biggest ask is just for a girl to spend any amount of time with me. Even if it is just to hang out with no expectations beyond that.\n\nUsually the discussions are on very good terms before the perpetual flake out stage begins. And no matter how much patience I show, it just doesn't change anything. And when I give up and try to move on to the next one, the same thing happens.\n\nMaybe in your experience men in general need to do better but I don't see how this would apply to me or what I need to be doing better.",

The DO BETTER has already been engrained into my brain since I was a teenager, but like most men in this position, a lot of us really have no idea what we are specifically doing wrong. You can point to what men generally do wrong but I have no idea what I'm supposed to tweak to finally get some success. I don't know if I'm supposed to become better looking or get a better job with better money first. I feel like I'm as kind and compassionate when talking to women as I need to be, while also trying not to be too eager or too much of a pushover, but if that needs improvement, I don't know specifically what. I feel like there are so many things I need to be to be wanted and no matter how much of it I follow, at the end of the day, it is never enough. Your \"do better\" message is like the same game over screen I've gotten all my life. And I have no answers and often wonder what's the point of trying anymore if it's always going to be out of my reach.",

    "postText": "I lost 36 pounds and was starting to feel happy with my body but then the loneliness hit. I only gained 10 which I guess isn't the worst, but I feel so alone. All I want is someone to just talk to about life or movies or games or just our feelings. Every conversation is surface level and it's so hard to connect with someone. I wish I could have a long tight hug from someone.",

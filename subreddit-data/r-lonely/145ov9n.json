I\u2019am a hopeless romantic so to cope I\u2019am always reading books or playing video games because I know In reality I\u2019ll never get to experience things like taking my girl out on dates or telling her how much I love her etc\u2026I\u2019am not giving up though no matter how pointless trying seems. But fuck. Sometimes I just can\u2019t bear it anymore. 22 years on this earth and I\u2019ve never been loved by one another, never thought of as a potential lover. It just hurts more on some days then usual. *sigh feels like my life is just on autopilot.",

Also, there may be more going on in your life that contributed to your loneliness, hence your down playing yourself. Talk to them about your issues. What you put in therapy is what you get out of it. \n\nGood luck Ad! \ud83c\udf40",

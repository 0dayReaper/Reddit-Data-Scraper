    "postText": "As I sit here on my porch at 1:20 am in the pitch black night with bugs crawling all over me. I think to myself I guess I\u2019m glad to be alive. But is that enough? Is that selfish to want more ? The sick man only wants to be healthy. Who\u2019s to say I\u2019m not sick and I don\u2019t know it yet. Maybe sick in the head. Sometimes I feel as if I was always supposed to be here; in the dark alone typing on Reddit. Maybe that\u2019s what I deserve. The last few years have been pretty rough, pretty lonely. Practically living inside my head. Don\u2019t speak to anyone my age. Don\u2019t call anyone. I hate to compare myself but like all humans I must. I look at my peers and wonder if I\u2019m just a memory to them. And maybe I should just fade out of everyone\u2019s lives for the better. I expect a lot out of myself but when you literally have nobody to talk to IRL. Not a therapist , family member, teacher. NO a friend , a SO, simply a mate. I don\u2019t want to give up but it is very tempting.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve been trying to find friends, but the same thing always happens. I mostly attract guys. We get to chatting, we have a good chat, but when it comes to photo exchange\u2026 that\u2019s where it goes downhill. The reason why it goes downhill is because I have a medical condition that causes facial abnormalities. Instead of someone just accepting that, they either want just sex or they leave (sometimes they even get upset and block me).\n\nOnce in a while, there is someone that tries to be my friend, but it always ends the same. At a certain point, they pre-reject me. What I mean by that is that they reject before I ever showed them any signs that I had any kind of feelings for them. You know how terrible that is? Rejection is bad enough, but to be randomly told, \u201cI feel like you want more than I can offer. I don\u2019t see you like that.\u201d\u2026 is a lot worse.  What about me? Do I have any say in this? Did you even consider my feelings when you said this hurtful, unprovoked thing? Also, like I said I never showed them any signs I want them in any way. \n\nYes, I\u2019m friendly. Yes, I\u2019m very loyal and committed to you because you\u2019re my friend. Yes, as a deformed person I do like to have a mature conversation about sex. I like asking questions about sex. We deformed, handicapped people do have sex and we like it. I\u2019m sorry to burst your bubble. \n\nBut, none of that is flirting, trying to hook to with them, or expressing any romantic feelings. It\u2019s always been friendship. \n\nAnyways, after being told that\u2026 the friendship is strained from that point on. You can\u2019t be friends with someone that wants to make sure and make it clear that you will never get with them. It\u2019s so awkward and embarrassing. Also, downright hurtful. \n\nAnd I wonder why they don\u2019t want to get with me. Oh yeah, my looks. \n\nI just want a hug and to be cradled by someone. \ud83d\ude14\n \nThank you for reading. Thank you for allowing me to vent. \n\nHave a nice day.",

But what I\u2019m trying to say is it\u2019s okay to be alone, it\u2019s always good to have friends but having friends can lead to unnecessary drama etc. for example I\u2019ve been used and taken advantage of all my life and just recently I cut those people I thought were my \u201cfriends\u201d off and that\u2019s the best feeling I\u2019ve ever experienced. So just know it\u2019s alright to be alone.",

So they think it's better for everyone to stop things before they start.\n\nWe all have our issues and reasons for doing things that other people would think don't really make sense.",

                    "comment": "I can deal with someone leaving after hours or even days of talking because they saw my photo. Here we are connecting as friends, but then they leave. Okay. Fine. Whatever. I can deal with someone that just wants sex. You\u2019re not getting it. Period. I can deal with someone that gets mad at me for looking the way I do, like I can freaky control it. \n\nI can deal with all that, but the pre-rejection pisses me off. It literally brings me back to grand school, where a group of kids, mostly girls would start hassling me about who I liked. If I\u2019m silent, they pick someone. If I say one mere thing about someone, like\u2026 \u201cOh, they look cute.\u201d, you better believe those girls (and guys) will run with that. \n\nThey will proceed to tease both of us. Until the guy makes it publicly known that they don\u2019t like me. Even though, I have either been quiet the whole time or I said that one stupid thing (that now I regret). That\u2019s all I did. But, apparently I\u2019m obsessed and in love with this guy. \n\nI mean, do you see how insane that is? \n\nAnd sure\u2026 it doesn\u2019t happen now. Thank goodness. But, a form of it still lingers. \n\nI guess I get PTSD flashbacks every time this happens.\n\nThank you for answering.",

It\u2019s a nice thought that maybe they liked me, but they were being a jerk and not being honest about it. \n\nWith all the rejection or pre-rejection I get, it\u2019s nice to maybe get a win. \n\nSo, thank you. I really do appreciate what you said. \n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry too that this same thing happened to you.",

Idk what their intentions are, for only to get friends or relationship (which is understandable) but friends? idk. At the same time, i do understand their behavior, its what it is, we are scared of unknown and hard to admit the things that we rlly wanted. It's not wrong to hv preference but i hope we all know what's exactly we wanted and do the exact thing. If they know they can't be friends with someone maybe they'll find unattractive then they should limited their act on talking to someone before knowing the other looks. Its hard because nowadays we all craved for connections. It's hard to blame on anyone with this matter and its not your fault to be treated like this. Everyone should feel comfortable to socialize. I hope you'll be alright soon, don't take it personally much and move on from them. Wish you all well.",

Truth be told, I did really hope and believe that we could have been friends, but then THAT happened. I\u2019ll be honest I\u2019m disappointed, sad, and hurt. However, I do understand that not everyone feels comfortable with someone like me. Even if it\u2019s just friendship. We aren\u2019t having sex. We aren\u2019t dating. But, they still feel uncomfortable. So, I respect and get that. \n\nI try my best to provide photos as soon as I can and I give them a full warning beforehand. Which is sad. It\u2019s sad that I have to literally warm people about my looks. I don\u2019t lie. I don\u2019t catfish. I make it clear that friends means no sex or dating, at least for me. \n\nI\u2019ve been through this enough times to somewhat prepare. Again, very pathetic that I have to do this. \n\nSo, I do try my best to deescalate what most likely will happen. I\u2019m always hopeful. But, I\u2019m a pessimist realist.",

Like you said, its also their fault to not make it clear on what they want. If its truly abt friendships, its unfair for some ppl to be judge by looks even if its relationship, i understand ppl do hv tastes. I just wish all humans are be given the same opportunity and not biased. You also don't need to provide photo if you don't want, maybe you can just mention a bit abt your looks if needed. You don't hv to if you don't want srsly. Hv a nice day!",

I go to activities with [Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com) but do so more just to be around people than to expect to make any actual friends. (If I don't expect anything I don't get disappointed, right?)   I usually have a good time and it at least gets me out of the house and at least having some face time and conversation.    \n\nFor myself, I seriously am wondering if I have Autism.  I came across a video on youtube about autism in adults and it all fell into place for me, why I have trouble socializing.  I don't enjoy small-talk, or loud crowded situations where there are lots of new acquaintances.   It's hard work for me to keep track of names and new information and I find those situations exhausting and after about an hour I'm ready to go.   I'm also a little off the beaten path as far as interests go, and I don't have a partner or children to bring into the conversation, so (and I hate to say this, but...) I think people find me hard to relate to.   And I find most people hard to relate to.  \n\nI'm not sure what the answer is yet but I can relate to what you said and yes I do feel like giving up sometimes and I can have a serious attitude problem at times.   \n\nI don't know if this helps but this is what works best for me, is finding groups that are based on activities rather than primarily socializing.  If I'm doing something I enjoy, I'm going to be showing my best side, and having fun is something that attracts people to you.  And the pressure is not on you to conversate, but when you're doing something, sometimes conversation comes easier.",

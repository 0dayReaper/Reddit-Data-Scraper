You need to change your lifestyle in order to achieve this particular goal. Doing cardio will not burn as many calories as you think. You need to ask yourself if you are serious about losing weight and gaining muscle.\n\nA lot of people choose to do the 80-20 rule. 80 percent of the time you eat healthy and exercise and the remaining 20 percent you can be more loose. Again, this does not mean you can consume a bunch of junk food, because that will cancel out the hard work you do during the week. People choose this method to not burn themselves out. \n\nIt is important to me to lose some weight and gain muscle. So I have been consuming between 1400-1500 calories and working out 7 days a week for the past 10 weeks. Occasionally I will have a cheat meal when I am really craving something. \n\nI am very serious about achieving my goal.\n\nDoing some cardio and push-ups is a good start but if you continue to eat a bunch of junk food and consume alcohol, you won\u2019t see any progress.",

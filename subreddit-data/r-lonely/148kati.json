    "postText": "I was alone for such a long time ... and now, after 3 years I find myself alone again. \nMy group of friends is not my group. I'm not a part of it. \nI only was when I was drunk, and I'm trying to quit now. \nI need to find new people. \nBut idk who would like me enough to become a friend. \nIdk. \nPeople always seem to like me till they come closer. \nI finally accepted that I'm alone again. \nI don't want to be. It's one of my biggest fears. \nBut what can I do? \nI just am.\nAnd I can just try to find other people. \nI'm just sad that I'm in a place where I never wanted to be in again.",

    "postText": "So I\u2019m 25F and I\u2019ve basically struggled most of my life to make connections with people, especially since being out of school I\u2019ve felt more alone than ever. It caused me a lot of pain but over the past few years I think I\u2019ve been able to accept my situation more and work on the issues I thought were getting in the way of me making connections. At this point I feel like I\u2019ve dealt with the core issues, but nothing has actually changed in my life. I\u2019ve overcome my crippling social anxiety almost completely and I don\u2019t have a hard time talking to people anymore, I\u2019ve improved my social skills, I\u2019ve learned to like myself and be genuinely confident and I\u2019ve even lost a ton of weight so I don\u2019t feel insecure about my body anymore. Despite all this though I still barely have any friends and I\u2019ve never been able to get into a relationship or even get a date, and I just don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing wrong at this point. The loneliness isn\u2019t as painful as it used to be but it still never goes away. It feels like even me at my absolute best isn\u2019t good enough for anyone, and if I\u2019m still not good enough for people I don\u2019t know how I could ever be. Is there any point where all this effort will result in any actual change to my social life? I don\u2019t even care if I have to be single for the rest of my life, if I could just find a few good friends I could see on a semi-regular basis that would honestly be enough for me. I\u2019m just so sick of being alone all the time.",

So it's not because we are doing wrong it's just it's not your time. You are doing good for yourself and you will definitely be able to make friends and connections. Sometimes things don't go by as you wanted them to doesn't mean you are not on right track.",

I\u2019m still glad I\u2019ve put in the effort either way, at least it makes things easier until my time does come, which is hopefully soon.",

I myself tend to ask myself when it would get better, as bad phases seem to last for a couple of years too! I think we can find solace in the fact that we are our true selves and when we do find potential friends, it will be meaningful..you now have a better chance at finding your tribe than if you didn't know yourself or settled just for the sake of companionship. I feel you, and am telling myself to stop 'waiting' and just live my life first, for myself and try to love myself unconditionally, without any external support. However, we are in the end, social beings and connection is Integral to our living...stay open, stay optimistic..happy to connect with you if the loneliness gets to you :) I'm 27F.",

I do much prefer being lonely and comfortable with myself than being lonely and hating myself for it like I used to. But you\u2019re exactly right, as comfortable as I am with myself I\u2019m still a social animal and it really feels like I\u2019m missing a core human need. Hopefully if I hold strong in myself though and keep putting myself out there I\u2019ll eventually find the right people, and they\u2019ll be people who like me for who I genuinely am. If you\u2019re struggling rn I hope you\u2019re able to find your people soon too and I\u2019d be happy to talk with you :)",

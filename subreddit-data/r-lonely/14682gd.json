    "postText": "So it's smoky as hell where I live right now and since I'm trapped inside I'm more bored than usual. I haven't had a friend for a long time and there's not a lot of people my age (or people in general) where I live and I don't work which doesn't give me many opportunities to make one. I'd like to have someone to talk to, support each other etc. Don't need to talk 24/7 but I like the idea of at least checking up on each  other yknow? \n\nAnyway, I like gaming, reading, walking/hiking, anime, spooky things, drawing, naps, and a bunch of other stuff but we don't need to have the same interests to get along. Currently playing Tears of the Kingdom and dying my hair green! Anyone's welcome just please be nice. Thanks for reading!",

            "comment": "Hey...Your positive attitude shines through even in the midst of smoky conditions. You sound very genuine, giving, caring, creative and extra smart. \n\nI also admire your  ability to be open and direct by expressing your desire to have someone to talk to, someone to share experiences with, and someone who can check up on you. That kind of connection can truly make a difference in someone's life.  \nYou should know you have a colorful personality which is clearly evident from the multitude of  interests you pursue, from gaming to reading, walking/hiking to anime, and spooky things to drawing. Wow!!!!  \nPlease do not second guess even for a moment you ability to succeed in life, your positivity and willingness to make sacrifices to foster sustained strong relationships/friendships.   \nWishing you all the best on your journey, and may you find the meaningful connections and genuine friendships you're seeking. Stay positive, stay motivated, and keep being the awesome person you are! In case you feel like chating/discussing any further, please feel free to message me.",

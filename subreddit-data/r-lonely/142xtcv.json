    "postText": "(29M)Right now, my day to day life just runs on and on. Work the same schedule, try to do something social on the weekends, but i just always fly solo. I feel abandoned by those i used to call my friends or my partner. Friends abandoning me and avoiding during the pandemic hurt me immensely, but the next was worse. Its been a few years since my last relationship, but the broken trust and lies she spread caused me immeasurable harm that echoed for over a year onward after the breakup. I feel bitter at times. I dont want to be alone, but any time i reach out act in a vulnerable manner and trust someone again... It just ends up the same. The ties severed and me left feeling like I am to blame. I let people do it again and again, be it friend, foe, coworker or someone else. I was told that people wish they could be my size, have my strength and power... tell me that i was kind, loyal, smart or that i had nice features... but when others dont know me, they only see the size and quietness as intimidating. The endearing features become cold to those who dont know me because they cant see beyond their limited perception of who i am. The restraint is seen as weakness, the calmness as a coward. I am judged before a conversation is had and sentenced to isolation before i can make a rebuttal. I feel akin to many who wrote about the depths of their despair here and I echo their wants of finding a place of acceptance and belonging. But that nagging fear of doubt placed by others has been eating away at my will for years and I dont know how wortht I feel anymore. I often feel this hermetic lifestyle is just going to become my norm. So, currently I have been trying to disrupt these thoughts and find some peace. I want to connect with others. But i never want to become a burden. I just want to be able to be treated like a person and not viewed for the mere shallow image others may have of me. Unfortunately, my size (a little below 6 ft 6 in,) Does not put me on eye level for most. I fear until I find a way to overcome this, I will remain  at odds with this task. Thanks for listening, I hope you all are able to find something more positive in your lives and make meaningful connections",

Hoping the small changes I make turn into bigger ones and maybe give myself a bit more time to relax and breathe. I appreciate you, and hope you find some positives too.",

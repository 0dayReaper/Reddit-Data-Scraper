    "postText": "Born \u201876.\n\nAlways wanted a happy home and kids.\n\nFirst relationship \u201995 when I was 19. Was planning to propose but turns out I was the rebound guy.\n\nTwo half ones between being 20 and 26, with lots of passion and lots of drama\n\n\u201803-\u201812: (29-36) Married, but we were always out of step. Best of friends, but barely lovers. In the end I bailed because I missed butterflies, though I tried to find them.\n\n\u201812-\u201821: (36-45) Off-and-on-and-off again messiest mess of them all, but it felt like the one, and I went all way in, even after getting the short end of the stick again and again. \n\nNow 46, soon 47, great home, great job, good friends. But I don\u2019t know anyone who is where I am in life. All my old friends have settled into parenthood (like I would have liked), or have decided they don\u2019t want kids.\n\nThe more recent friends I know, 10-20 years younger, from my nerdy boardgame hobbies are stepping back one by one to live the life I wanted.\n\nMy sisters live 9000 and 1500 kilometers away. My parents are separated, single and 80+ both.\n\nI just want someone I enjoy being with, and to build a life with, and hopefully raise one or two humans with.\n\nThe odds are diminishing by the day.\n\nAnd my joint-custody dog just turned 15.\n\nMy days are lonely going on lonelier.",

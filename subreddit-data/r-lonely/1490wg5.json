    "postText": "I have 1 friend in real life, we are not close at all and I haven't seen him for months. I have a few online friends but it's not the same, it's mostly just an outlet for me to bitch. I am pretty much terrified of going outside to meet people and straight up don't believe that it's possible for me. I feel like I'm not allowed to have friends, and have no idea why I feel this way. My family would encourage me I'm sure but I seem to be immune to encouragement and praise and would rather actually stop what I'm doing when it happens because I don't feel like it's warranted and don't want the attention. I feel completely stuck as if this is just how I am. I had a 3 year addiction to otc cough syrup and recently have really been wanting to relapse after only 4 months clean just because I feel so stuck and aloof and have an extremely hard time talking about these things in real life because it's all bullshit that makes no sense to be feeling. I see a therapist and I'm trying to start opening up but it's very difficult and fill actually following her advice afterwards is more difficult.",

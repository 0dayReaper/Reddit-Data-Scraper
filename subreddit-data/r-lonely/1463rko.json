    "postText": "So, I am a guy around 22 years old. Text me if you want to talk about your passion, life, harships, cry or share your happy or weird side that usually you find it hard convey to irl friends. I can adapt to anyway you want and hope you do put in minimum or equal effort in all of it. I'd like very much if you are finding hard time to get friends so I can be the type of friend you are looking for and hope you can avoid ghosting but thats alright. Lets say we are \"Damaged finds Damaged\" type of friends. The reason I posted in this community is because I can't say this to anyone irl. Tbf, I can't even speak about anything irl.",

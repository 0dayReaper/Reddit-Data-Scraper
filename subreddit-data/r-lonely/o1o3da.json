Or I\u2019m cooking something and I imagine a friend asking me what I\u2019m cooking, and I answer out loud. Or I say a joke and I imagine we both laugh. Am I just lonely or have I finally lost my mind?\n\nedit: Well, this is comforting. It\u2019s nice to know I\u2019m not insane. I\u2019m feeling little less lonely today. ;) Thanks everyone.",

As an introvert I require a full day at home to myself every now and then and when I don't get it I feel drained and long to be home alone to get things done while having pretend conversations. I get so much more done when I'm able to talk aloud to myself. I'm glad to hear others do this too!",

Although most everyone here understands, I think its worth stating out loud that I know full well what I am doing while I am doing it.  There is never ever a moment where I believe I am talking to someone real, or really 'hearing' their voices (Its ME filling in their words for them),  and nor do I think I actually had that conversation.\n\nIn addition to being an only-child, there is also a level of 'no one likes the things i do'.  I think part of what I do comes from a need to want to share and explain something exciting to me, but no one I know really cares.  Its like pent-up energy that needs to be expelled.",

Thank you for putting that into words bc I never really knew how to articulate that feeling properly. I was an only child for a while too so I get it.",

I feel like I'm beating my friends down with how much I need to unload, so maybe this is helping? Not totally sure. But it makes it easier to share thoughts and feelings when I can record them in real time and try to parse them later.\n\nMaybe not what you meant exactly, but I am literally talking to myself.",

    "postText": "This obviously isn't my main account, so I'm going to be bluntly honest and not worry about the repercussions. Firstly, I'm a 22 year old male. For at least the last 5 years or so, I have been dealing with a number of issues across the board and life has been pretty tough, at least emotionally for me. Most of these issues are intercorrelated with one another, but they all would be fixed with one thing changed - if I were born a female instead of a male\n\nIt started out as just a thought based off all the shit I've been through, but it literally plagues me more every day, and I don't know how to feel about it. It haunts me. Like, I could go into so much detail about exactly how and why, but I'm just going to keep it short and say that it haunts me continuously. It's slightly better and it sorta leaves my mind when I'm in a relationship, but only marginally\n\nToday, it was triggered when I saw some really cute combat boots for sale. Like, I want to be able go dress myself in things like that and all sort of other stuff, but not as a male, not as a crossdresser, and not as a trans anything, but as someone actually born as a woman. And there's not a damn thing I can ever do about it. And who would I talk about it to? I have no one, my first ex systematically destroyed every friendship I had, and my family would 100% make fun of me for even mentioning it, and they wouldn't stop, ever\n\nIt sits heavier on my mind, heart, and chest than anything else and yet there isn't anything I can do about it. So how do I proceed? What the fuck do I do? I really would like someone else's thoughts on it, so please reach out if you have any sort of thoughts on it\n\nHaters in any form can share too, but just firstly let me say fuck you before you do and that I doubt I'll respond if you're nasty or rude",

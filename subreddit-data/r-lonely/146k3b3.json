    "postText": "Hi, first time poster (26m) here. Went to see a movie tonight with some friends that I only see at the movies about once every few weeks. Anyway, sat next to a girl I\u2019d only met a couple times. Throughout the course of the movie, she would maneuver to get comfortable and tried laying on her side in those nice recliners. Most of the time she faced away from me, but for a little bit she faced my seat. Honestly, that was some of the most open and intimate body language I\u2019ve gotten from someone, especially a woman around my age, in a long time. And it felt great. I\u2019ll never date her. It won\u2019t go any further, but in that moment it didn\u2019t need to. It was just nice. It\u2019s the little things.\n\nSome years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds are harder than others. Some are better.",

However, and no judgement at all but, it's a little bit depressing that her being in a comfortable position that just so happened to be facing you had such a profound impact. Clearly you're deprived of intimacy, just like the majority of people in this sub (myself included). I really hope you are able to experience true, genuine intimacy one day my friend. \u2764\ufe0f",

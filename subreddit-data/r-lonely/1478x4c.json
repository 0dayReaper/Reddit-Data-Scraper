    "postText": "This will be a vent, I apoligise beforehand I can't do this anymore not like I will take my life away or will harm someone I want to leave these current suroundings. Every morning I wake up with this feeling of meaningless and I would rather spend my whole day in my bed not talking to anyone not seeing anyone online or offline. People say that life is beautiful and you should make every day count but not me, count towards what? towards death, I sometimes wish we all would perish and only our souls would be visible. I met this girl recently and I have never felt what I felt while looking at her I felt like I need to know her who knows if we will ever know each other but I'm sure I will see her in the other life. Why is life like this I know you can experience happiness without suffering but is it really true if it's true then why do babies laugh at what terrible happened in their life why we all can't live and be happy why can't we all be happy? People say it's a state of mind but it's not. Every day we see our role models as attractive people on the streets we look up to them but why? why is always someone higher on your radar than someone who would really need it why do we only remember people who have perished on this planet, we all are so soulless and ignorant towards everyone we all ignore that morning thought why are we here and most of us lie to ourself, I can't live rest of my life with lying to myself. I was always following the orders in school and had the best marks and now Im lost does that mean I failed with the best marks only teachers know. I don't like it here it's going to shit all of this, this whole planet. People expect me to work take up summer work to work for some capitalist pig who only waits to buy his third variant of the same car that he has in the garage while our whole climate animals and everything is going to shit I can't be motivated to destroy more things, you know there will be a day where all that we did will come back to haunt our asses. Being loved is normal but I guess Im just unlovable, since I  was born I was born to be unloved by strangers no one knows me when I want to reach out I found we have no common interests how is it that we both want to be liked and loved is that much to ask to be loved maybe. Maybe god created me to only suffer Every day I wake up I feel miserable no that's  an understatement my whole day is miserable I hate it that girl is my last hope I don't  want to be miserable I want to be normal have normal thoughts  be a functioning member of society, I find it really hard with the thoughts like this All the best to everyone I hope you will be less misserable than me :)",

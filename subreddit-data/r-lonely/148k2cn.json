I mean when someone genuinely loves you, and they show it in the way they fully embrace you, holding you close, as though you were the most important person in the world in that single moment. That sense of comfort and security, the subtle scent that they exude. God, I would sell my soul to just feel that again.",

I remember these hugs mostly from my childhood best friend  or more so soulmate who became later my girlfriend but then she left me it was only person in my life who could give me this sensation sometimes I would really wish that I would never experience this feeling because when you know what it feels like, you can never get enough of it and most people can't give it to you",

When the strippers aren't dancing, they mingle at the bar and if you get cozy with the right one, they will give you the biggest, most excited hug. You can hold onto each other for extended periods. It's amazing sometimes.\n\nBut before I was going regularly, I dormed at a party school. I couldn't wait to finally date, meet girls, find love, get laid, drunk, party, all that stuff. I watched 4 years of everyone around me hooking up and getting laid and flirting all around me. I had a lot of female friends but nobody wanted to even give me a hug.  I found I was touch starved in the one place where everybody was getting some right under my nose. I graduated still a virgin and it haunts me to this day.",

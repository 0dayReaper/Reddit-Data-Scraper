    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m new to Reddit. I guess I made one to try to find likeminded people and to connect in some way. I\u2019m 26 (F) and I\u2019ve lost all my friends and want to meet more people and hopefully make new friends . It\u2019s been tough to make any new friends lately. I work from home and sure me and my coworkers talk outside of work, but it\u2019s still very work friendly. I\u2019m into gardening, plants, movies (love horror and ghibli movies), video games, art, reading poetry and philosophy, etc.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how I \u201clost\u201d my friends, well, we all kind of fell apart and are on different paths together. We check in once in a blue moon, but I wish I had people I can talk to daily. My best friend passed away recently and it\u2019s been hard to meet new people. \n\nI really do try. I go out to clubs, bars, art events, but most of the time it seems people already have their own groups or they want to be more than friends. \n\nI\u2019m just taking a shot in the dark here, but hello!!",

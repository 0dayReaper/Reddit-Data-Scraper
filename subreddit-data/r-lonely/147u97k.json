    "postText": "I went on a date with a girl last Thursday. I mean i have the feeling she isn't interested but I don't get why for nearly 1 hr she put my hand on her Thigh, sat very close to me while we were watching a comedy performance and we had a pretty good time talking. Middle of the date she even spoke about plans for going out again to a hookah loungue. Why would she put my hand on her thigh and act sorta intimate with me and now not respond to me when I am just following up on something she said? Day after our date I said I like her and feel I connected with her. She said she had a good time but said she was busy the rest of the week. but said 'another time!.' I said we should go out next week to a hookah bar and she said 'Perfect.' I tried setting something up next week Tuesday and she said she'd get back to me about going out on Friday. Friday she never texted and now its Saturday....",

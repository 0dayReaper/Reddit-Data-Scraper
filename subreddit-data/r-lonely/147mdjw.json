We want what we cannot have, and those who will happily have us are often looked at as not worthy of our time. Or put another way, those who like you, you're not attracted to, and those you're attracted to don't like you. The adult thing to do is to make a choice. Do you continue to chase those you adore or become content with someone who adores you?",

You had reasons why you decided this person deserving of a chance, and you also recognize that your behavior towards this person changed as your feelings grew. Both of those things are reasons for your personal struggle. The first is the reality of attraction, that chance was not offered randomly and no individual starts by taking a chance on someone they see as being below them. The second is the reality of fear, it is fear that prevents you from being authentic at the time of first meeting such that you play a role instead of being yourself as you would with someone close. You opening up in unexpected ways then leads to a dislike of the person \"you aren't who I thought you were\".  This isn't just shade directed at you, people \"lie\" by fear and omission to attract. I haven't been able to think of a way around it. That's why authentically facing your fear and acting as you would in a relationship fairly quickly is to the benefit of both people. It's less damaging to just be you from the jump because then you can learn whether the authentic you is someone likable by those you choose.",

But sometimes even if you are literally perfect the people you love can be flawed too and not realise why you\u2019re so good . Also maybe the person you are in love with might not even be a good match for you but you view them with a biased perspective and only later you might realise its better to not have been there . But yes I definitely get it. It really hurts to have hope and then it gets destroyed and sometimes even if someone is bad we really want it",

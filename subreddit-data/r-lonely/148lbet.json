Normal always depends on the demographic. \n\nIn any case, I think giving therapy a shot might be helpful. If not for anything else, you could get the push to try to go out there and fill your loneliness with what you need. \n\nTrust me, as a person who also has imaginary friends and stuff, this is not really what we want for ourselves. We must do right by us and at least try to meet our needs",

    "postText": "Firstly, im 27 and i dont have friends. I've always been a very lonely person and i come on here to talk to ppl sometimes. \n\nSo I was talking with a guy for a whole year and I became really attached to him. Like I would talk to him about everything, I honestly felt like he was a best friend, the only person that understood me. I opened up to him about things that would never talk to anyone else about. And he new about my problems and past issues that I've gone through with guys. And he would say that he was attached to me too and would message me every day and asked how I was doing. Idk it all felt very genuine. There were also other things that we would do, based on my posts. Anyways after meeting for the second time and not having sex, he slowly started pulling away and just ghosted me. I've thought about that day over and over again, wondering if I said something or did something. Thinking that I did something wrong bc this wasn't the first time a guy stopped talking to me after meeting and he knew about those times bc I've told him. I talked to him about everything. I would tell him if he felt like he didn't want to talk to me anymore like the other guys, to tell me and not just ghost me. And still he does this to me too. And now I'm left feeling more lonely then before. I just couldn't understand why he couldn't tell me what happened. Why after so long he can't just answer my messages and tell me. But now the only thing that I feel l did, or didn't do, was not have sex with him. And I guess that's all he was looking for. I still don't know why it took him pretending to be my friend for a whole year, but that's the only thing I could think of. \n\n(Edit: the reason I say it was just about sex is bc I could still see his comments on his reddit before i blocked him. He was commenting on a girl's nsfw stuff when I was messaging him to tell me what happened. He could see how bad I was hurting and he still jerking off.)\nAlso I feel so stupid bc I bought him that he talked about getting that day we met and I'm stuck with it now.\n\nSorry this is a very long rant. I've just been so sad about this for 2 weeks and crying about it. But now I'm mad and feel so stupid.",

Cause as a guy that speaks fluent dude, we don't spend time listening to a woman talk about her problems unless we feel like something is there, regardless of sex.  If all this dude wanted from you was sex he would've moved on a lot faster, unless he was up front about it and it's not mentioned in your post.\n\nKeep in mind the goal for most is finding a partner that you can call your best friend.",

He's going to need time before he can muster up the ability to have another committed relationship. \n\nBut I mean it sounds like you two were fairly infatuated with each other to me but hes not ready to commit?  Or he may have taken your decline as a sign you weren't interested in him romantically.  Could just be a huge miscommunication.  \n\nYou could always ask him if he's ever been romantically interested in you, that is if you were ever romantically interested in him.  Or don't, and move on.  if I was you and I was never interested, I'd just move on.",

She\u2019s apologized profusely and is very much the type of person to beat herself up over hurting me. So I know she\u2019s not having the best time mentally either. The emotional whiplash is just what got me. \n\nNow I\u2019m stuck wondering if I should hold out hope for an actual chance once she sorts things out or not, because I had a legit deep gut good feeling about the idea of us getting together and honestly the night we got physical it felt like the most natural thing in the world to me.

She said she wanted to have sex with me, I explained that I was a virgin and that I wanted a girlfriend / somebody I love and know, to take my virginity. \nShe completely understood, but she wanted to remain friends.\n\nAfter we snapchatted for a couple of days, we found out we had SO much in common. Both of us admitted that we had feelings for each other, she understood me in every way and vise-versa.\n\nThe day we had agreed to meet, she didn't show up, she ghosted me. I don't know exactly why she did it. But part of me thinks, she only wanted to f*ck me, and that a relationship would be too much \"work\" only to hookup with me.\n\n(To give you some perspective) I am a very lonely and shy guy. All I have ever wanted is love, nothing else in life matters to me, than finding true love.\n\n\nTo give you an answer - Not all but, many guys only want sex, but women can also be like that.\nPersonally, I would never befriend a woman, only to have sex with her. I may fall in love with her, but plain sex / hookups just aren't my thing.\nAnd no, I am not asexual. I get h0rny a lot, but love just weights more.\n(Sorry for the long comment and possible spelling errors)",

            "comment": "I one had a guy who I thought was my best friend.I told him I was a lesbian and so he stopped hitting on me. Everything was great until one day we went to a house party and this woman started hitting on me. We started making out a lot. I\u2019m talking tongue to tongue action. Afterwards she asked if I had a place I could take her back to. I wasn\u2019t in the right state of mind to take a woman back to my crib I just met. So I told her let me get your number and can arrange to get together sometime. So after we were done making out she started making out with my guy friend. I was so disgusted at this. I mean she was licking all on his chest. I didn\u2019t care anymore at that point to even text her. But then my guy friend was like come here and join us. And she looked my way and smiled and had her arms open. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Come to find out they knew each other lol. It was damn near a set up. And he didn\u2019t try once but twice to get me to join them. After the party he asked if I was sure he didn\u2019t wanna go back to his place. I told him hell no I\u2019m sure I\u2019m lesbian bro. And then he\u2019s all like but you only live once. I told him this is creepy bro just take her back to your crib and have fun I\u2019m not joining. Then he said look here\u2019s the thing you can make out with her while I\u2019m fucking her or something. It\u2019ll be fun! He must\u2019ve thought I was dumb asf.. But this goes to show you many guy friends are always looking to fuck. And if given the chance they will. \n\nI have another guy friend that knows I\u2019m lesbian and he\u2019s been really great to me. He knows his boundaries and he treats me like one of the homies. But I will say it\u2019s VERY rare to find guy friends that just wanna be friends! \n\nThe first guy friend #1 has been cut off. I didn\u2019t feel like he wanted me as a friend anymore. I felt like if I gave him the chance to fuck me he would. I didn\u2019t just cut him off because of that one incident but one night he invited me out to a house party. He told me it\u2019ll be women and booze. So hell yeah I was going. He always knew where the parties were at. So we get there and it\u2019s only ONE guy and him. It seemed like he kept tryna put me in scenarios to have a 3sum with him. Even the guy at the party thought I was down to fuck. That explains them tryna get me high and drunk. I just felt very uncomfortable with this guy friend I had to cut his ass off. \n\nThe second guy friend #2 has been a really great friend. He knows I\u2019m super lesbian and he just looks at me like one of the homies. He know I\u2019m into women and I use to sure damn near all my sex stories or dating stories to him. Now I keep it to myself. He\u2019s the kind of friend that I know would never try to sleep with me. This kind of guy friend is very rare. If he does invite me to parties he makes sure everyone there knows I\u2019m 100% lesbian. There is no straight in my bones lol. I feel very comfortable around him.",

Also the fact that he was made aware of past experiences where you were ghosted really makes me think he didn\u2019t have great intentions.

Without excluding the mutual attraction.\n4) There is great incompatibility or never was any affection between the two, leading to friendship.\n\nAlso, we love our friends. We want what\u2019s the best for them. We hug them, we kiss them, we have the need to be close and vulnerable with them. Guys hug, pat at the back, shake hands and high five for example. So the need for physical touch and considering both are straight, is satisfied. \n\ni hope the above are eye opening or can offer a different perspective to the situation. and to be honest, no, i don\u2019t believe in friendship between a man and a woman because it is perceived differently by each party. and the people are not blame, but our nature is :)!",

Then they said something about eating at their mother's.  I felt that might be an excuse to get me out.  Why is this man not able to have food in their own place to cook? \n\nThey laughed at my comments, which I like.  They had the nerve to say we would have to tie the dog up outside, while we had \"fun.\"  I asked why tie the dog outside.  I told them I would call them when I wanted that fun.  \n\nI felt there was something off with them.  They didn't have food.  I could see they were struggling!!!  I understand struggle.  They didn't ask me for anything, I'm just not looking for struggle!!!!  \n\nI don't know where men are who aren't looking for free fun sex, unless you find a much, much older man who can't perform.  Even then, he may TRY to get it up, if you allow that.  If you want to continue to look for men who want to be friends, go ahead but try not to let your heart get involved so much that you feel this upset and sad, this is life!!!!",

I\u2019ve had ex guy friends ask for nudes before and even jerk off on call, needless to say that immediately got them blocked. \n\nI have had many guy friends over the years. Mostly online, though in high school I sat with the guys I knew from my program at lunch. My high school had a program that basically all my classes had the same group of students. \n\nI can say I\u2019ve always been plus sized so back then I was never been too worried about being friends with guys. It wasn\u2019t until after high school that I had a guy friend or two express interest in me romantically. Both did end up resulting in a relationship, one for two years and the other for a week. \n\nThe two year one was long distance and I think we were both pretty much were not interested in sex even when we visited each other. Simply because it was inconvenient. We stayed at his parents place, so it was hard. \n\nAll I can say is not all guys are interested in just getting sex from female friends but it truly depends what your friendship is built on. Is it built on convenience? I.e being in proximity in college or mutual friends? Is it built on mutual hobbies? I.e video games or writing? \n\nMost of my guy friends were meet via video games and I\u2019ve only had 2 of them as long term friends. Only one of them is a really close friend now. Since the other one got a girlfriend and practically forgot about me.",

Thing is you can't just generalize a group composing of 4 billion people. There will be many people that will only want to be your friend cause they want to have sex with you but also many people who don't want to do that to you. Guys and girls will both do that.   \n\n\nPeople saying that if a guy doesn't find you attractive and that's the reason  they are being your friend is while in many cases is true there are also many cases where it is not true.  \n\n\nI can only give my self as an example but I have had several female friends in the past who I found physically attractive and there personality was also attractive but I did not want to date them. For me I am quite happy with just being friends with them and there are cases where I wanted to befriend someone so I could date them but it is not just because I want to have sex with them, sure I'd like to if I started dating them eventually have sex but when it comes to girls that I wanna date I want to date them for there personality and how they make me feel. I want to love them and have them love me.   \n\n\nYou have to judge each person on a case by case level. Look out for common red flags and be careful but don't be too careful that you end up isolating yourself. Try and find a healthy balance that will allow you to be happy.",

It seems to me that if he actually just wanted sex, he would at least had made it clear at some point.\n\nOn the other hand, I think you are assuming that if you discover that a friend is attracted to you, that means that he was attracted to you in the beginning and the friendship was just a convoluted strategy to get close to you. There's also the other possibility: that people who are friends with people of the other gender may become attracted to some of them. It's natural to like people you get along with. I think men struggle a lot with a big contradiction in dating discourse,  which is that first they tell you that approaching girls you don't know is either shallow or creepy and instead you should ask girls who you actually know and have common interests with, but then they also tell you that it's inappropriate to ask friends on a date because that means you tricked them into thinking it was a platonic relationship but you actually had ulterior motives.",

In response to the title, some guys do, but thats a minority, and they dont usually spend a year just for that, they are often more impatient.\nThere is another possibility that could fit here.\nThrough studies, it has been proven that the way men and women develop romantic feelings for each other differ. Men might approach a woman and become her friend without being romantically interested in her, but her opening up to him, showing him her vulnerable side and her feelings can make him become interested in her, even if they are only friends, while also making the woman see him as a friend instead of a partner.\nThis might sound stupid, but it is really painful for many.\nThe thing is, a year is enough time for all of that to happen. Im not saying it is what happened, but maybe he started developing feelings for you, and when he saw you didnt think of him the same, started becoming distant to avoid being hurt.",

Every time I got ghosted the conversation ended for her part with writing to me \"I will write again tomorrow, I promise\", without me even asking. And I felt terrible every time she would come back but I wouldn't mention it, to not push her away again. And I would probably do the same thing again if she decides to contact me again. I do not get what the point of it was/is honestly. \n\nBut hey, if you want to talk to someone, feel free to write. I do not contact people on reddit myself as it just comes off as if you have some intentions towards something. I do not do that, that ship have long gone plus I look like a troll.

It's totally impractical, because his goal isn't to develop an attachment, it's to have sex. Asking someone about their problems every day isn't indicative of chasing an objective to me, that's just being considerate.\n\nSome guys are opportunistic, and they don't chase sex with their female friends but if given the chance they'll jump all over it. Some guys are looking for an emotional connection before sex, and will leave whenever they feel certain that connection isn't there. There are some men that have thought about sex with a friend, but would never act on that thought even if invited to do so.\n\nMen, generally speaking, are very cognizant of who they'd entertain the idea of sex with. But plenty of men's relationships are not defined by whether or not that feeling is reciprocated. If a man only wants sex, he's not going to burden himself with getting to know the real deeper you and he's not going to wait around for you to initiate sex first. He's going to flirt and float the idea with you often so he knows quickly what his odds are.\n\nTo be honest, based on your post, it's really hard to understand how each of you viewed your relationship. You were attached to eachother, but just friends? Was this a situationship, did it seem like you were both feeling out whether a relationship was possible, or was it ever explicitly understood that you were just intimate friends and that this couldn't go anywhere? Without knowing which one it was, it's hard for me to understand why he'd ghost you. It's definitely weird and rude to do regardless, but there's plenty of reasons he'd do it that aren't just a lack of sex.",

You should not discuss your failed relationships at great lengths with the new guy.  You need to focus on taking care of yourself and putting yourself in situations where you will meet someone worthwhile. Men will be attracted to you more as well.   You just need to show up. Find some hobbies that get you out in the fresh air.  Lead with kindness not blindness.",

    "postText": "\u201cIn solitude's embrace, I lay without sleep\n\nWith thoughts that swirl, my doubts ever deep\n\nThe weight of the world upon my soul's solemn host \n\nNo respite, no release, for this lonely ghost \n\nWithin this room, uncertainty grim\n\nMy vision obscured, my destiny dim\n\nTurbulent tides, the storms last for days \n\nNo respite, no release, from this my malaise\n\nRomantic ventures, a labyrinth of woe\n\nLove's whispers fade, leaving echoes to grow\n\nYearning for connection, a heart's fragile plea\n\nNo respite, no release, my lonely decree\n\nThe ache of late nights, my thoughts intertwined\n\nYearning for solace, a heaven in mind\n\nBut still, like a fool, I search for relief \n\nNo respite, no release, from the happiness thief\u201d\n\nAnyone struggling with loneliness and depression, just know that you are not alone. It is nothing to feel shameful or embarrassed about, especially after the pandemic years we just went through. I\u2019m in my own personal struggle, and I am sending all my positive thoughts to anyone out there in their own personal battle right now.",

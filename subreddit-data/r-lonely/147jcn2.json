Please I really need it , I\u2019m at the end of my rope I won\u2019t last much more. I\u2019m sorry for being a failure",

If we\u2019re hero for everyone then we\u2019re doing something seriously wrong. \nYou are a hero. Not for others but for yourself. If anyone doesn\u2019t care about your life then they\u2019ll never care about your death as well. \nWake up. Take a bath. Stop thinking. Play music. Look towards the sky and stars. And enjoy the time with yourself without thinking about others. \nWishing you luck. \ud83e\udec2",

    "postText": "The worst part of my loneliness is that I am somehow undesirable despite having most traits girls seem to find attractive. Everything in my life is working out well but I'm still lonely. \nI try to cope everyday and if I could push a button that would make me disappear, or have a gun, then I'd be at peace. \nI cope at the moment by eating junk food, drinking alone, and taking sleeping tablets- just to delay the present. \n\nI'm seriously debating on suicide every single day and I'm sure it's gonna happen someday. The only thing stopping that right now is my little sister (age 8), although I constantly ponder whether it would be better now than when she's older. \n\nMy family have ditched me, my friends are really friends, and my work colleagues are all much older than me. I feel so isolated but also so frustrated because I am fit and healthy, in a good job, always kind to others, I can be funny, fairly smart etc etc. It just doesn't seem to make sense to me.\n\nMy life feels like the trueman show except all the actors are told to avoid me.",

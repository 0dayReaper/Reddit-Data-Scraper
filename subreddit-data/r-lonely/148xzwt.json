    "postText": "I\u2019m having a really hard time lately. I feel so fucking alone it feels like a horrible heartbreak. Everyone in my life sees me as a free therapist, rather than a friend/girlfriend/family member. I see the life draining from their eyes when I begin talking to them about myself. My roommates make me feel like a burden and talk down to me every chance they get. I feel like I\u2019ve probably done this to myself by surrounding myself with these types of people, but I\u2019m feeling so stuck and hurt. I have dreams every night about killing myself. I can\u2019t sleep, I barely drink water, I eat way too much just to feel something. Even writing this I feel ashamed and stupid for complaining. On top of all of this, I\u2019ve been grieving my friend\u2019s suicide for the past couple of months and I can\u2019t even talk to anyone about him. I can\u2019t afford therapy and I don\u2019t know what to do. My boyfriend doesn\u2019t want to hear me talk anymore and actively ignores me until I come to him and tell him I\u2019m sorry for being too much. I\u2019m working 6 days a week and am basically serving on delivery food and vitamins. It\u2019s so draining. I don\u2019t know where to go or what to do and it\u2019s feeling like the only thing left is to put everyone out of the misery of being around me. I\u2019m just too cowardly to truly do anything. I don\u2019t know anymore. I\u2019m sorry if this is a lot or a dumb thing to put out there. I just need to know someone out there might be listening for once.",

And try to take care of yourself physically;  you can\u2019t feel good mentally if you feel like crap physically.  Hang in there,  the grieving process is hard, especially when you loose someone to suicide.",

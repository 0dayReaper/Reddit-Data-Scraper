    "postText": "So this wasn't recent but it's been bugging me and I guess now that school is over its bugging me even more now. So I started off highschool pretty normal, lonely as always but then I met this girl in my science class one thing led to another and we started dating, it was the casual teenage couple that lasted longer than most, I didn't think anything was gonna go wrong because her parents liked me, we managed to stay in contact all the time and we really loved each other, it all went downhill when she wanted to meet my parents(my parents are abusive as hell and one is currently in prison) which conveniently my mother was in jail for a DUI and my dad for domestic violence, I didn't have my parents on homecoming so my older sister drove us there, I saw my girlfriends house and her happy life, her father spoke to me saying he was a cop and apparently knew all about me and.my very messed up relatives, he didn't mind since I was just a kid, I could tell that I was really accepted by my girlfriend and her family but I grew more and more distant, my parents forced me to breakup with her and to this day she hates my guts not knowing the real reason I did it, she thinks I broke up with her because I found her boring and stupid or something, but really it was because my parents were furious when they found out I was dating a girl who's dad is a cop and ran a background check. I'm not asking what should I do, I just wanted to vent and complain a bit(thank you to whoever took their time to read this)",

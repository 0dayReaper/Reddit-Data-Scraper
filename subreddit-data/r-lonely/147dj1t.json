Like besides listening to a lot of music, playing games, YouTube and steaming to pass the time I just don\u2019t do anything.\n\nI just have a complete lack of life experience and whenever I\u2019m talking with someone all I feel I do is listen and ask more about them because I don\u2019t have or ever had anything interesting happen.",

I don\u2019t talk to anyone (because I feel like I\u2019m bothering them, also I don\u2019t like small talks). I waste time doing nothing but these days I try to go out once in a while just to look at other people being themselves and admire the beauty of nature. I think life is bearable if I learn to be kind to myself.",

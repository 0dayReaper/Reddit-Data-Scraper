            "comment": "You just need out.  Getting away from all of that will help you.  I'm going to suggest some jobs that house you now that it is summer.  If you live near Cedar Point in Ohio - they have dormitories for their summer employees.  Many hotels and resorts will house you.  You can apply with a nanny company - and become a live in nanny if you like kids, or a live in caregiver/companion for an older person.  Some cruise lines will hire 18 year olds and then you live on the ship.  \n\nYou'll have to live frugally, but it will get you OUT.  Some of the jobs might even suck, but they give you a stepping stone to independence and don't have to be forever.\n\nThis is a nice link with information.  https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/dzm1et/tons_of_resources_for_seasonal_adventure_jobs/\n\nYour situation does not have to be permanent - taking your life is.  And your best years are ahead of you.",

You MATTER and so do your feelings, you\u2019re valid and important and worthy.  You are worth so much more than how people and things have made you feel, sending hugs \ud83d\udc95",

You might find something affordable that way.  Don\u2019t give up hope just yet.  A new town and a new life could be just around the corner.",

But the only options are to fight or give up. In my opinion giving up is just the easy way out and worse, it gives validation to your abusers. Don't give them that pleasure, prove them wrong. It might get worse but hell at least you tried. Just remember that your pain is not going to last forever, there's going to be a point where it will all go away. So just do what it takes to get to that point, without losing your life. Anyway, I hope you find that peace, good luck and best wishes.",

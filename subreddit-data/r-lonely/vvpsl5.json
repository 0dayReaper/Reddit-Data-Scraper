They think every decent person deserves a relationship and if they don't get one it is a great injustice. They see sex and dating as a test of a man's worth and women as the tester and the reward for passing. When women chooses a man based on her own reasons rather than society's they think it is a sign society is falling apart. The \"Incel\" community started as an online place for lonely people but their ideology has evolved into something else. They blame women for their psychological troubles the way Hitler blamed the Jews for the bad economy.",

They don\u2019t care if you\u2019re actually sad or alone, they don\u2019t care if you have a partner.\n\nReport them if they\u2019re going against the rules, block them, and maybe see about changing your message settings.

As a guy I can understand that most dudes relate their \u201cloneliness\u201d and \u201cdepression\u201d to not having a romantic partner and unfortunately makes up majority of the users on subs like these. Which is honestly why I stopped looking for people to talk to on this sub because that isn\u2019t me and I\u2019m not about to compete with anyone to develop friendships like just want to talk to like minded people is all. What I\u2019ve found is that investing more in your current interpersonal relationships outside of the internet will help, whether it\u2019s people you haven\u2019t spoken to in awhile or maybe people you see at school or work, anyone who already knows you I guess. \n\nI know this may not be what most people on this sub want to hear but the people in your life who you feel are not nurturing your relationship with them are likely going through shit which they are struggling to deal with as well, especially with the environment we\u2019re living in now where everything is shared on social media and everything is fake. I\u2019ve stepped away from the I\u2019m alone in this mindset and more to the we\u2019re all in this together mindset, we\u2019re all dealing with shit, we all have things we\u2019re working on. Keep your head down focus on moving forward, one step in front of the other, and one day you\u2019ll be there and you can start helping others get there as well. And I promise you that will be more fulfilling than anything else.\n\nThere\u2019s an episode of Joe Rogan (I know ew, but this particular guest said somethings that really stuck out to me and have helped me change my mindset lately I\u2019ll link [here](https://youtu.be/4S-6d99n2h4)) he spoke with Navy Seal Andy Stumpf where he talks about \u201ckeeping your world small\u201d and the training seals go through and how to the outside it seems extremely hard when you look at it as a whole but when you change the way you think about it, it becomes a lot easier. For example you can look at a pie and think \u201cI have to eat this whole pie\u201d OR you could look at it like \u201cI have to eat one slice\u201d and then you keep doing that over and over until the pie is gone. Keeping your world small, focusing on getting from point A to point B not from point A to point Z. I know this is sounding cliche but seriously this has really changed the way I handle myself each day, just focus on one day at a time. \n\nHope this helps anyone who may read this, I promise you, you are going to get there one day, wherever it is you want to be, you will get there.",

If you look at dating subs, you see mostly woman posts at the top then a ton of guy posts that get no attention. It's like women are worth more and guys are worth nothing. I can't say that. I'm worth nothing. Less than nothing. I wish everyone felt welcome to post here. I've been treated well most of the time and any time I hear someone is being treated poorly, it hurts to read.

    "postText": "TW: long, boring, stupid, bullying, suicide\n\nI'm a 34yo woman as of last month. Wild.  Because that terrified, bullied young girl still feels so close inside my head. \n\nGrowing up I was always alone. My parents gave me up and I was raised as an only child with my grandparents while my two younger sisters were raised together with my mom. I was bullied by family, friends, and classmates growing up because I was fat and had \"boyish\" interests. And because I dressed like shit. And I probably smelled too because I was so depressed I never brushed my teeth and would just throw my greasy hair into a beanie or something to avoid showering. My grandpa called me a bag lady. He looked down on me for playing video games as a girl. My aunt called me a pig. She made fun of me when I couldn't fit into her life jacket when I was 10. Kids would chase me and moo. Kids would steal my stuff and throw it in the trash. Kids would throw gum and cheese or whatever into my hair. They'd beat me up on the bus or if I tried to walk home from school. They called me a fat dyke. My family thought I was gay as well, despite having no friends let alone romantic interests. I felt so unwanted, unworthy, and not like everyone else (but in a bad, monsterous way.) \n\nThe neighborhood kids filled a composition notebook with detailed entries about what a disgusting monster I am. I thought they were my friends.  \n\nI'd go to school and wish that I was invisible. I'd go to bed at night crying and praying to just be taken away to Never Never Land, or to wake up with a new identity. I didn't see the point of my existence, and at 16 I went into my grandparent's bedroom and pulled out the pistol from under my grandpa's side of the mattress. I sat on the edge of the bed and looked down on it in my hands. I was alone in the house. And then a voice came to me in my head. I like to think it was my voice, reaching out to younger me. It told me that everyone actually loves the underdog, and that there would come a day when I was loved and celebrated. It told me to stay curious about the future. I slipped the gun back under the bed and I've never contemplated suicide so closely again. \n\nAt 18 I left home and finally broke out of my fear of talking to people. Long story short im now I'm a property manager at a motel and nobody would guess that I was ever \"shy\" (or that I actually still am, but just a big fat pretender.)\n\nI wish I could say that I'm a success story. But instead I'm a person who can't escape loneliness. My mother once said I have a black heart that will never truly let anyone inside. I resented that, but there are moments where I wonder if she was spot on. There are people who *want* to be my friend. I keep them at arms length. They're mistaken. I'm a bad friend, because I don't know how to friend. I've been in the same relationship for 9 years, and I have a 12 year old child. My child is the only person I'm certain about loving, but the poor girl.. I keep her at arms length too sometimes. It's all I know. My partner is my best friend and we do everything together. But he's a simple man. He doesn't read, he doesn't like discussing deeper ideas or theories, etc. We mostly play video games and watch shows, which is fine to only have that in common. \n\nBetween my partner and my kid I'm never \"alone\". But I struggle to shed that lonely feeling of not being \"like everyone else\". A monster in woman's clothing. And no matter how much I try to think my way around my sadness and anxieties, they still live here. That worthless, stinky, fat little girl is still who lives in here.",

            "comment": "Imo this certainly constitutes a success story! You're alive, you're here, you have a family, have a pretty great job I would guess (idk too much about property management as I'm 19 but I'd imagine it's well-paid and such). There's a lot there that, if you really inspect it, shows you are extremely capable and valuable as a person.\n\nNow, you still have struggles but that doesn't tarnish all you've managed to create for yourself, for others. And your struggles are completely understandable and logical. The people you were supposed to be closest to hurt you terribly on a daily basis and allowed others to do the same. It's only natural to fear having that closeness with people now, as there's a chance they might do the same. And you acknowledge that you feel that child you were still lives inside, because they do. You've been carrying around this hurt for all this time.\n\nNot to be that person but if you can, please find a support group, a qualified therapist, **or** do your own research and find personal methods to help yourself heal. You deserve that happiness now. It'll take a while to unlearn 20 years ish of that habit of detaching yourself to an extent, in relationships, among all the other things. But once certain things become regular, and changes begin to happen, I think it'll do wonders for you.\n\nI really hope the best for you :)",

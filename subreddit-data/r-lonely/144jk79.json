    "postText": "I've been \"popular\" throughout my whole life, not because i'm a cool person to be around, hell no. Its because i just so happen to force people into being friends with me subconsciously. Im about to start a new grade in 2 months and iver the summer ive been going through a physical change. But now, i want to go theough a psycological one. Heres a couple things i want to change please help. \n\n\n\n1. I have terrible humor; for the past 2 years I've been completely isolated from any other person other than my parents, well, technically parent considering my mom has to leave for her job in another state for several weeks in a month. I have no siblings and the only way I've been able to talk to people my age was from the internet. When i came back to school last year i was clearly an outcast. I wore a mask when the other people didn't, i was shy, and the worst thing, i had a bad sense of humor. My humor with people for the last 2 year was weird, sensual humor where i joked about inappropriate topics and i'd cling on one friend out of the friend group. This type of humor was both annoying me and my \"friends\" at school but I'm not able to snap out of it.\n\n2. I look weird; now this one isn't a problem for me but it is a problem for other people really. I have a weird sense of style, mix matched clothes, pajamas etc. and my hair. I spent the entirety of break i have right now to change my appearance to fit how i want to look like and ive made close to no change at all but ill just wait it out.\n\n3. I cant take social cues; in feburary of this year i had a nasty falling out with one of the \"closest\" friends i had all year and it sucked... well for me. Come to find out from a newly appointed friend both my \"close friend\" and another friend i had both hated me to a ungodly extent, making fun of the way i looked, the way i dresses, etc. This news dropped and shattered my whole world view on the people st my school and i realized one thing when i got home. I trusted people too easily and so i started to become colder to people not recognize people as my friends but more as people i talked to. And that eventually made the next point easier to realize.\n\n4. Im a very lonely person; i have no friends, noone to talk to, noone to hangout with, noone who wants to be friends with me, noone who wants to date me. Absolutely noone at all. Whenever i set plans to and out with someone its always \"oh sorry i cant hang out today maybe later?\" And later never comes. I play no sports so i have no teammates and for the rest of the two month break i hide away in my room doing absolutely nothing",

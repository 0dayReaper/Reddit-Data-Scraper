I'd like to share where I've been doing that. A discord group of people like you.\r  \n\r  \nFeel free to vent your frustrations out into the void, or reach out to the community for support and advice. Everyone here has gone through or is going through the same thing, we all understand.\r  \n\r  \nThe group also hosts events like watching movies or playing games in voice chat. Listening to music together and event hosting karaoke! These events have helped me get through some dark nights and keep me afloat on days I'd otherwise be isolated and alone. There are serious discussions and playful jokes all around. It's also got a strong meme culture brewing, you're bound to have good laughs on the darkest of days.",

    "postText": "I turned 30 today. I feel like I lost all my youth. Two years ago I became disabled and I'm now homebound. I lost all my friends because of it, because I became too sick to keep in touch regularly. It's my birthday and no one besides my mom wished me a happy birthday. Nobody else knows me, nobody else remembers me. And because of my disability every birthday from now on is going to be like this. I can't believe I'm not in my 20s and with a whole life ahead of me anymore.",

Still have many years out there to make the best of it, and maybe when you\u2019re feeling up to it you can offer some hope or mentor the next generation.

I however hope you find and recognize the small things in your everyday life you may be able to do. It can be a cup of coffee in the morning while watching outside world from your window and just sitting there relaxing with your own toughts, or it might even be reading the Bible or some other thing associated with your own beliefs and trying to find something in it to give you food for thoughts and perhaps even strenght to keep on fighting.\n\nThings are rarely easy but in the end, you have your mother and it is not about grandeur, but the small things.\n\nAll the best for you as you enter a new chapter in your journey.",

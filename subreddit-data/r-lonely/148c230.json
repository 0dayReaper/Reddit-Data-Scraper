    "postText": "That\u2019s it really, I have always wanted to be part of a friend group with a lot of people but it just never really happened. I guess I\u2019m not good at talking to people or start up a conversation. \n\nOr rather no one wants to talk to me. I was always to one to take initiative. But each time it just ends up being awkward with me doing all the talking and then just standing there replying to my question. Just recently I ended up messaging one of my friends that I lost contact with. \n\nWe used to be really close but then drifted off and the conversation ended like the rest of them, awkward. People around me have started dating and I can\u2019t even hold a conversation. I sometimes look at them and think wow why couldn\u2019t I be like them? All in all I just want friends. Maybe college will end up better.",

You will find your tribe. Do the things your interested in and be confident and keep trying, don't seem desperate. Don't give up.",

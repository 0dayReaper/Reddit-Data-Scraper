    "postText": "I was never the first choice. Nor anyone's best friend. Maybe sometimes I'll get a message from someone, but it's barely noticable in the ocean of silence. Trying to get new ones ends up the same way. I post or message someone, chat for a little, I run out of things to say, and then get ghosted. I understand some people can't handle my negativity. I get I'm not interesting. Then why does it still hurt? Why do they have to give me hope, only to rip it from my broken heart? Day after day, I look for someone to fill in the missing pieces, but no matter how perfect someone is, they don't want to be around me. Seems like I'm just doomed to being a side character, always there to be around the protagonist, but never getting the spotlight.",

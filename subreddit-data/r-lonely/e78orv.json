            "comment": "Here\u2019s a perspective that sheds light on how isolated I feel. I thank anyone who takes the time to read it. It\u2019ll mean so much to me. \n\nHere is my daily routine:\n\nMy alarm goes off 2 hours before my work shift. I then lay around for 30 minutes and then get up to take a 30-45 minute shower in which I sit down in said shower and look at all my notifications and check the weather (I live in Alaska and I need to know how cold it is to dictate what I wear and if I need to warm up my car). I then spend the rest of the time getting dressed and grab something easy to eat which is usually just lunch meat and a yogurt. I then fill my back pack with a soda, v8 juice, and fruit juice and take a yogurt to go. At work I sit at a desk and check my email for company updates and customers requesting supplies and I play on my phone until I have a customer. My play-on-my-phone time is usually watching YouTube for music and video games and sometimes an inspirational video. I do this for 8 hours and I spread my backpack food over the course of that day. After work I head home, take off my shoes (which are laced shoes that I turned into slip ons) and take off my layers and my pants. I hate wearing socks and prefer to walk around the apartment barefoot with a t shirt and my underwear. If I feel gross I will take another shower otherwise I pour myself a drink like whiskey with coke or a coffee with cream and sugar and then microwave a TV dinner. After that I turn on my tv and check to see if my online friends are on so we can play Destiny 2 together. If not I go to YouTube to see if I haven\u2019t missed anything or to put on a gameplay video of the games I love. If nothing is there then I turn on Netflix to see what I can find. If not there then I rotate to checking if my online friends are on then to YouTube and then to Netflix. I repeat this behavior until it gets late or until I find something I like or if my friends hop on. I then fall asleep and repeat this Monday through Friday as since those are the days I work. On Saturday, I wake up and immediately take a shower for 30-45 minutes and then turn on my PS4 to repeat my game, YouTube, and Netflix trifecta until it\u2019s late or something sticks. On Sunday, I wake up, take my 30-45 minute shower, and get dressed in comfy clothes. I go to the laundry room in my apartment complex and start the wash load. I then set a timer for 45 mins and then I leave the apartment and go grocery shopping and collect my mail for the week and then when I get home I put all my groceries away and then rotate my laundry. I then set a timer for 50 minutes and then turn on my PS4 and repeat my game, youtube, Netflix trifecta until my timer sounds off and then I get my laundry, put it all away or dump it on my bed (depending on my depression and loneliness) and then return to my trifecta until it\u2019s late or I find something I like. And then the week restarts and I repeat the process. \n\nSome random things that sometimes changes my routine:\n\nOn Saturday, if there is a movie I\u2019d like to see in theater I use the Regal app to preorder my ticket and I always buy a matinee. I\u2019d do my normal morning routine as if getting ready to work (wake up two hours before, 30-45 min shower, etc) and then go watch the movie and then return home to proceed with my PS4 trifecta. \n\nSometimes if I have a craving I\u2019ll go out to eat once a week (usually on Saturday) and I always go somewhere I never been to. \n\nThis is the blueprint of everyday. Yes in all the in between moments I talk to my coworkers and I talk to waitresses/ waiters and the people who work at the movies. I talk to my online friends when we get a chance. But still I feel completely lonely, isolated, and depressed. I have broken many routines and I done many spontaneous things in my life to reach out and meet people and try to find that one meaningful connection but nothing sticks. I\u2019m 29 now and I\u2019m no different than the old man who has outlived all his friends and family. I feel lonely and no one really cares to get to know me. I just want a real connection and I honestly feel it\u2019s too late for me. I\u2019m not exactly bad looking but I think my problem is that I\u2019m awkward and weird. My face looks unapproachable even if I\u2019m in a great mood. Just a constant resting bitch face for a dude. So my \u201caura\u201d or \u201cvibe\u201d or the impression I give is that I\u2019m someone who can\u2019t be interrupted even though that is further from the truth. I want to be interrupted. I want my life to change for the better if that means a connection is involved. I just wish I could be seen despite my isolation.",

The main thing I\u2019ve learned recently is that it\u2019s up to me to get myself out of this sort of limbo. It takes some effort at first, but it\u2019s doable and worth it. What I did was just deciding to go to this language exchange event at a cafe that I stumbled upon on Facebook. Got a bit of cold feet when the time came to go, telling myself I\u2019d rather stay in my comfy room. But then it would be no different from any other boring nights, so I just dragged myself out anyway. Had a great time, way less effort than I expected.",

In the past two years, I have not spoken to a single person face to face beyond co workers at work, cashiers when I have to get groceries, and twice a year my parents and my son. Those instances are strained, awkward, tense, painful. I have not received a call other than debt collection agencies. I have not received a Facebook message, a text message or any other. To be fair nor have I sent them. \n\nThe ten years prior to that were little better. I used to read posts here and other subs that told me I wasn\u2019t alone. That it was ok. That other people felt the same way. So it normalized it for me. So I took comfort in that and allowed it to continue. \n\nThe end result is a feeling beyond loneliness. A deep seated hatred of myself. A loss of identity. Loss of multiple jobs due to an inability to function with people because I am so filled with self loathing self pity and hatred for every living person because they aren\u2019t giving me the love attention affection or acknowledgement that they owe me. \n\nI know.  I know I did it to myself. I know that no one owes me anything. That my paranoia, and self loathing make it difficult for others to reach me. \n\nThat wall started with using random strangers on the internet as the bar. \n\nThis isn\u2019t normal. This isn\u2019t good. This isn\u2019t how most people live their lives. Stop asking this sub to validate the hole YOU are digging.  Have this conversation with someone who loves you.  Face to face. It\u2019s hard. But if you don\u2019t do it now, you will reach a point where it\u2019s not an option.  \n\nThis entire post sounds like I\u2019m an asshole.  I am. But I\u2019m this case I\u2019m not trying to be. I\u2019m not demeaning you or insulting you (op and all the rest of you here because you\u2019re looking for help). I\u2019m praying that you can read between the lines and self deprecation and know that my only goal is to save you from my fate. \n\nPlease reach out.  In person.  Please don\u2019t end up like me. \n\nDISCLAIMER:  I am an actual genuinely bad person. Maybe none of this is true for you. I don\u2019t know. Take it with a grain of salt I guess.",

    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m a 21 year old woman who has been lonely for several years now. I have no friends and I don\u2019t mean that in a quirky \u201cI hAve No FRIendS\ud83e\udd2a\u201d kind of way. I haven\u2019t had any friends for several years now and you would think I would know how to cope with loneliness but I do not. I try to cope with loneliness in the most unhealthy ways. For example, I will download tinder, delete it, re download tinder, delete it, download bumble, delete then re download tinder. Sometimes I would get a really good match that I would begin talking to and would try to date me or we would click really well but something always happens and it doesn\u2019t last. I\u2019m also really addicted to TikTok, it\u2019s the first thing I watch when I wake up, while I\u2019m brushing my teeth, showering, at work etc. it helps me feel a little less alone. I often will try to reach out to people that I knew in the past and they wouldn\u2019t want to talk to me and I would even be persistent and try to reach out multiple times. I know that I seem crazy but Loneliness will do that to you. I don\u2019t want to be that crazy person but I only have my sister to talk to. How do I cope in healthier ways? How do I find online friends that I can talk to?",

While I would love the advice of \"just follow your interests/hobby, dont mind being alone\" I know it doesn't work for me, so I tend to merge the using of any of hobbies I do, or would, like, into opportunities to meet people. Since its like if I meet someone, great! If not, well I'm still in an okay place. That and of course you meet people with relatively similar interests (and/or beliefs depending on what it is you're doing).",

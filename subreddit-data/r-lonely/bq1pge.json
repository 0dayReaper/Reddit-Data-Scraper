There's nobody, there's those who don't care, then there's those who make the slightest possible effort to appear to care while making it abundantly clear that they couldn't care less.\n\nI've had it explained to me time and time again that the stuff I'm interested in is boring and that I should be interested in sports and stuff like regular people so it's my own damn fault that I'm lonely and have depression.  Depression is extremely easy to just snap out of at any time, so I'm told.",

I tried reaching out, implicitly, but that failed. I can't tell this to my girlfriend because she is her best friend and I don't want any kind of fallout happening from it. I feel pretty bad right now. I'm terrible at expressing my emotions but watching you guys have the courage to do so inspired me. Thank you :)",

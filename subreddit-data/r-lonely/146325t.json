    "postText": "When...you can't even deny how fucked up you are. You suffer battling yourself trying to be and do better but I think it says something when...you can't even try...'trying to be good' lol...it's self explanatory and even more so telling when trying to do better feels more painful than what idly being evil would achieve...when that's your fucking normal that's how yk your truly fucked. Naturally evil. So much you become blinded until painfully obvious that much is true including the fact your also insane to realize you've beat something innocent to death noticing your blood soaked hands and feet numb through natural repetition... involuntary, unintended but naturally and reflexively fucked....and that was your goodwill in the moment and in that moment you were lost...the idea everything that comes your way no matter how you perceive it will be brought to ruin...the fact things have to get so fucked until you notice your that twisted, broken, corrupt and whatever else you can name all meaning essentially wrong. That's how you know.",

Perhaps the way you could look at it is you recognise what you\u2019re struggling with and know the difference between \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018evil\u2019 suggesting you have a conscience and moral compass, and that\u2019s not fucked up. Just seems like you may require some help finding your way, as many of us do. I\u2019d suggest searching for a support group that\u2019ll help you on your journey. There are lots of people out there who want to help, I hope you manage to find you way. Best of luck!",

The only help that'd be possible if someone shared the same mentality enough to aid me on my exit mission. But yeah in general those who are lost are best to seek help as much as possible before giving in if they seek to continue living and if they'd find themselves regretful. I however hate this world, all it stands and all who live in it. So though hesitant and questioning ultimately it's best I go there being no use trying. My hatred ruins all good and I'm tired of fighting it. Advice is solid though",

So what you see is what you get and if you think that makes me miserable and pathetic that's just your opinion. As I'm entitled to mines and the both if not all imo are inconsequential. Especially considering further what I know personally to come in my own unique experience such things wont necessarily matter. Personal opinions, ability, personality, connections, values, beliefs and desires won't matter.",

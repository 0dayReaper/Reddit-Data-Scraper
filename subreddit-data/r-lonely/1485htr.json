    "postText": " At 24 I\u2019ve pretty much sworn off dating, but before that I\u2019ve even considered forcing myself to have sex just so that I can be in a relationship. I want to have someone I can talk to and who won\u2019t be annoyed by me, but I also don\u2019t want anyone to see me naked ever. I don\u2019t even like being touched. \n\nAt this point I just go on first dates because USUALLY guys don\u2019t expect sex from a first date since I say no hookups in my profile. But then after that I have to end it so they don\u2019t expect sex. \n\nIt just gets very isolating. I meet a lot of people on first dates but it still feels quite lonely since they only know my performative first date persona.",

Some men are very willing to either wait until you\u2019re comfortable (you said you might not be asexual) or they don\u2019t have a high libido / are fine masturbating instead. \n\nI\u2019m Demisexual technically, meaning I need an emotional connection before I\u2019d consider sleeping with anyone. I don\u2019t like the idea of strangers touching me or sleeping with me. I don\u2019t go on dates currently but I\u2019m always upfront about not wanting sex. Sadly I haven\u2019t been as lucky as I\u2019ve had several guys try to coax me into sex. I always say no.",

So, i understand. Right now, i'm okay being single and will find someone when i truly want to hv long term relationship.

Not going to a therapist at all and get complaining of the pain is the suffering. \n\nSure if she goes to therapist and turns out she is just not into sex no issue but I\u2019m sure the therapist will help her find the right way to deal with it instead of asking Reddit for advise which site, in some cases is fine but not the only source",

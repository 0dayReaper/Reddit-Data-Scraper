    "postText": "why is it that my peers around me seem like they have so much friends and people in their lives, always going out at night together and living the teenage summer dream. I can no longer fool myself and tell me that social media is not what it seems like. But why is it I have no one to post and no one posting me. I\u2019m always by myself in my bed since im not close with my immediate family. It\u2019s so hard being an extrovert with no friends. I feel so lonely and lame. I\u2019m just tired of spending my summers by myself and being isolated. I just want friends",

    "postText": "One week ago, I added this girl on twitter and started talking with her, I got her snapchat and instagram username, added her, we started talking on snapchat, we were having great communication I would say, but from yesterday she didnt message me back at all, she posted a photo on instagram yesterday, I commented in that photo and she didnt even like my comment. I mean she didnt even know how I look, the communication was fine, tf did I do wrong? I dont care about her cause its just 1 week, cant get attached that fast but its really weird. Should I ask her what happened, should I unfriend her, or should I just do nothing?",

He was going to move in with me but his family always got in the way. I thought that was very selfish of them and my bf to choose them. It's shouldn't be whether to choose over one another but to include everyone. I never got in between him and his family but he always made them a priority over our relationship. So that's another way someone doesn't reciprocate. Don't feel too sad now. Maybe we can prank call some of those people who aren't there for you? I'm down.",

    "postText": "I don\u2019t know what to say exactly, I kind of just want to feel like I\u2019m talking to someone who cares. If you don\u2019t like to read a lot this post probably isn\u2019t for you.. I struggle- I struggle constantly. I\u2019ve struggled as a child, as a teen, and now as an \u201cadult\u201d (I\u2019m 21M). I\u2019m naturally an introvert at heart, socially awkward, and a very small friend group. My mental state is out of wack, I find myself being distracted during the day from my thoughts, and emotions but at night I suffer. Im always alone, not being myself around others to try not to dampen the mood. I\u2019ve suffered from major depression with psychotic episodes because sometimes it\u2019s all too much (this was when I was around 16). My views on the world are nihilistic, because I truly feel like I don\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t matter to my friends, my family, and to you. You don\u2019t know me and likely never will. Im just another person, a face in the background. Even being in a relationship it\u2019s too much for my partner- I can understand it\u2019s not necessarily her fault and can\u2019t fix me, I know she can\u2019t. But when I tell her im struggling and depressed and need to talk she just writes me off or we end in an argument. The person who I believe should be that person to actually care for me for once doesn\u2019t. I stay up till sunrise thinking, being alone with my own thoughts. There\u2019s just something about me, a void that I can never get rid of.. I know I suffer from trauma and while it\u2019s bad I do romanticize romance (if that makes sense- almost like a hopeless romantic ig) nothing else/no one else means anything besides the one I love.. because in a world where I feel like I don\u2019t matter they think I do.. yet I\u2019ve never received anything like that ever, it\u2019s just constant loneliness and suffering. These thoughts and feelings are in my head 24/7 now.. at work, driving, at the gym, gaming, and of course right now- I rarely get 4hrs of sleep because of my mind. I feel so much yet nothing at all, I\u2019m alive hoping one day I\u2019ll be able to live, I look in the mirror and almost get confused on who tf I actually am. Am I worth anything? What is life and why should I live it? Why is it that the only thing I want in life is someone to care or just think about me every now and then.. and I can\u2019t get that but I can get every other negative aspect there is about life. There\u2019s no unconditional love.. there\u2019s no purpose to life.. there\u2019s no importance or acknowledgment of my existence.. yet I wake up the next day with the same emotions as before, and I know I will the next day.. and the next.. and the next.. Thank you, the person that read this- I don\u2019t know your name but you\u2019re the first person to hear my actual thoughts. In this split second of me typing this out I feel like I matter. Thank you.",

Like I said in the first comment, if you\u2019re ever feeling lonely or want to talk with someone because you can\u2019t sleep instead of being stuck with all your thoughts, I\u2019d be happy to chat.",

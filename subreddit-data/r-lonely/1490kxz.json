    "postText": "I'm 18m from Poland.\n\nSince I was a child I isolated myself from the outside world by sitting in front of my computer for entire days.\n\nBecause of this I have developed no social skills.\n\nI have not made any friendships and the people who somewhat enjoyed my company have left me after finishing elementary school.\n\nI never really saw a problem here, it was just comfortable to live this way. What more would I want?\n\nWell now I want someone close to me.\n\nI have trouble making new connections and developing anything.\n\nI can't talk. I don't know what to say. My interests are different from the ones people around me have (I absolutely love experimental music).\n\nNo one seems to care about me, I'm so boring. I'm so boring. I'm so boring. I'm a fucking statue. \ud83d\uddff\n\nI'm lonely now, and it's killing me. And I do really mean \"killing\".\n\nI've kept all my problems to myself: depression, suicidal thoughts, purposelessness, etc.\n\nBut recently the pain has become unbareable.I have began to have panic attacks. This never happened before. I just get massive paranoia about not being able to talk to people like a normal person. I'm broken. I hate myself. I hate to be alive.\n\nI can't accept being alone. I've lived like that all my life and I don't want it anymore. I need a connection. I want someone to care for me as a human being.\n\nHonestly, with how things have been and how long I've been suicidal, I'm surprised I'm still alive.\n\nI can tell I'm improving, or at least trying to improve - I'm trying things I've never tried before.\n\nI was ready to kill myself a while ago, but I wanted to become better and I just can't seem to.\n\nI told both my parents about my situation, they are both supportive of me.\n\nMom has offered me professional psychological help, she said that she'll try to book an appointment \"this year\".\n\nI also told my parents that I like men, which they don't seem to mind, but they agree that I won't find anyone in my town since everyone is homophobic here.\n\nAlso, my mom is somewhat mad at me, because she has been telling me that I can tell her about my problems and I never did.\n\nShe's also mad, because she suspected something is wrong with me back in elementary school (she was right).\n\nThe teachers never suspected anything, so nothing happened, no one helped me when I needed it.\n\nI have been fucked over for several years, and I've been fucking myself over for not having talked to anyone.\n\nAnd now I am scared of my future, I don't know what happens from now.\n\nI am not able to connect to people and love anyone here.\n\nI'm so lost and don't know what to do.\n\nHowever, I have no doubts I'll kill myself eventually.\n\nThe aching and the breaking are the making of a soul.  \nCan tomorrow be more than the end of today?  \nOr do posies just bloom for the feel of a May?",

            "comment": "Hey, read the entire thing and thank you so much for writing it. 20m here so a few years your senior but I was able to relate so much with this.\n\nI think a big part of solving it is taking small, baby steps. Insignificant and safe. You mentioned you sat infront of a computer all day and is comfortable with that for the longest time, try going out for a walk, talking with no one. Go for supper, grab a drink at the other side of town, find a small, insignificant goal for you to go out where people do.\n\nThat's what helped me just a bit.\n\nThere's a lot I admire about what you've mentioned, like how you managed to come out to your parents. I wish I can be true to others as much as you were. \n\nWhat you said about your Mom also shows a lot of empathy. She clearly cares about you and you (correct me if I'm wrong) care about her too. My Mom's my closest friend, but I can't help but not tell her what makes me feel down, what mistakes I made in life, and why I can't seem overcome them, and she's frustrated about that too. It's actually kind of comforting to see someone else having that similar experience. \n\nIt's good that you have an understanding of how you feel, but no one's ever too late to feel better. \n\nP.s.Your music's a super easy way to start. It's a universal language. One doesn't need to share your taste in order to learn it from you. Once, someone I randomly came across online had a 5 hr long convo with me where we just shared our weird likes in music and nerd it out.",

There aren't really social clubs here and I have doubts anyone will want to come up to me just to chat. I've tried sitting on a bench a few times just so someone gives me a bit of attention. Tried to be inviting. No one came.\n\nI've came out to my parents because I'm in a very desperate situation here. Being gay is something that makes me depressed and lonely as well. I can hardly find someone to connect to, so finding a GAY DUDE who I can connect to is genuinely impossible here. I don't even care for sex really. I just crave simple romantic acts like holding hands or hugging eachother in the forest at night while placing our heads on eachother's shoulders and falling to the ground while embracing ourselves. I like to daydream. &gt;w&lt;\n\nAlso, please just tell your problems to your mom, buddy. She's here to support and help you! Please ask her if you can have a talk. It's going to be a bit awkward but it will help you bond. Trust me.\n\nAnd I wish I could talk about music with someone. I've got so much to say.\n\nAlso, thanks for responding. I'd be interested in having a chat, buddy. &gt;wo I promise I'm a kind soul.",

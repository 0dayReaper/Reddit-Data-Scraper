You will be hurt and you will suffer, but you will also receive care and affection from others. Those fearing being hurt are doomed to looking only at the ways humans fail one another, and those who only look at the good in life must similarly deny all kinds of suffering they receive. I believe living a life where you can acknowledge you'll hurt someone and be hurt by someone and think that both of you are strong enough to find compassion in those moments of betrayal and find ways to keep your eyes on your partner when things aren't great are the ones that last. Relationships die in ice more so than fire.",

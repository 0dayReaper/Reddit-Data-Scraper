    "postText": "Im FtM and 25, my partner is M30. We've been married for 2 years. TLDR I feel so lonely even though I'm married to a great guy.\n\nI realize this makes me sound ridiculous and spoiled but please hear me out before downvoting to oblivion. \n\nI have a strained relationship with my family because of my queerness and I plan on cutting them off as soon as I can. So, my family, who has been involved in my life so far, will soon be out of the picture. I'm trying to keep my contact with them to a polite minimum. I used to love talking to my mom and sister but since I came out to them, they've been... horrible, to say the least. So I lost support on that end.\n\nThen came my friends. I reconnected with some childhood friends and they accepted me into the group. I really, truly loved the time we spent together and for a while everything seemed fine. But then that friend group started slowly ignoring me until it became painfully obvious that they don't really think about me or want me around at all. I had some mental health issues due to which I left the group chat we had. Around that time, I also had a suicide attempt. After that, they just... started doing things without me. They meet up together, go to picnics, concerts and various other events without even inviting me. So, I stopped talking to them. And they didn't really seem affected. And so I lost support there.\n\nThen, I met some new ones. It's a bit hard for me to make friends as an adult due to anxiety and some other issues I have, but I managed. I met some fellow queer people on pride and online, and we started casually hanging out every once in a while. They seemed to like me and I enjoyed their company. But, just like before, they started doing things without me. I don't think I have the right to feel offended here since these are people that I havent known for THAT long, but...it still hurts. It hurts to know they always plan and host events for each other, give each other presents, and overall shower each other with affection and I'm just an accessory they tolerate. I understand they are under zero obligation to include me in their plans, I am just trying to convey that it really hurts me to be the only one left out.\n\nThen, I adopted a kitten. I love and adore him. I love taking care of him and I don't mind any mess he makes. He's a curious little fellow - loves exploring, going outdoors, meeting people, playing with balls...a bit more like a dog than like a cat. I love him to death. But he doesn't really like me back. He doesn't let me pet him and every time I pick him up, he starts wiggling and trying to escape. The only time he shows any interest in me is when it's feeding time. Not wanting to push his boundaries, I try not to overstep. I play with him, feed him and clean his litterbox to make sure he's well taken care of, but there is little to nothing I receive back. It makes me feel like shit.\n\nThen I met someone who ended up meaning a lot more to me than I (probably) ever will to them. That person now has a partner, a puppy and a new job, so they are quite busy and I can't really expect them to be available. We last talked months ago. They're no longer responding to my messages, leaving me wondering if I did/said something wrong. And so I stopped sending them. And now I have no one else.\n\nNo one else, but my partner. My partner who doesn't really understand any of this. He's a bigger introvert than me, and is one of those people who is happy to just be around one person (in this case, me). That's enough for his social battery. For me... I miss having friends. I miss having a family. I miss having people to gossip on brunch with, to go to conventions and fanboy with. I don't like it that I only have him. I can't drag him along with me as he has different interests to me. He tries to involve me in things he likes, he takes me places in the hopes I'll meet someone I'll like, but something about his social circle is just off to me. I can't seem to relate to any of the people he surrounds himself with and it makes me wonder what the hell is wrong with me.\n\nI know people have it a lot worse and this is probably a petty post to make, but I have nowhere else to share these feelings. I feel incredibly lonely, and like days are slipping through my fingers. Like I'm wasting away.\n\nPlease be gentle in the comments. There's only so much I can take currently.",

            "comment": "Hi , dear human being. I hope you're doing somehow well. I see that you're going through some hard time. I hope that you'll find the strength to go through it. As I understand you went through some changes. I won't even pretend to somehow get what you're going through.  I just hope that you'll find some peace around you, and in you mind. I guess it would be hard to feel different and see people you'd expect some support to kinda let you down. Be it friends or family. I guess that you'd feel lonely with that person being busy and even your cat being kinda a douchebag (all cats are like this,  I'm still a cat person \ud83d\ude05). I'd say that you need to find something to help you have a feeling of accomplishment. An activity that you could do and have a feeling of \"I did this , it's a good thing\" like planting flowers, drawing, or music. And also learn to  voices your fears to your partner without giving them the impression that they aren't doing enough. Something like \"I know you're doing your best but I feel a little bit lonely and even If you're the best that could ever happen to me and I'm grateful for that, I'd like to be a spoiled kid sometimes and ask more than I deserve. I know it's greedy and I can live without having those childish needs fulfilled , once every blue moon I'd feel great I'd you could\" . Also take a dog if you can. They are always demanding attention... \nI'm still a cat person.",

                    "comment": "Thank you much for your kind response. I do have a sense of accomplishment as I have a bunch of hobbies that make me really happy. The problem is, I never get to share anything I make with anyone (theyre hands-on hobbies). I never get to talk to anyone about them. I really like sharing things like that with people I care about, but they way it is now I have to keep that to myself.\n\nWhenever I try to talk to my partner about this he gets upset because he takes it personally. We talked about it yesterday and all he could think of to say is - it's been like that for me too over the past few years, you'll be fine. I can't really share things like that with him because I think that he doesnt really understand, even if he went through it himself. He doesn't value friendships as much as I do, or at least pretends not to. A lot of the times when I confide my feelings to him, he gets philosophical about it and starts debating with me. And I just give up because I dont fucking. Want to debate my feelings. \n\nIn any case, I really truly appreciate your response. Thank you for reaching out to me. I hope things get better for me",

There will be people with the same interests, and with a bit of luck you maybe make friends. \n\nYou like reading? Join a book club. Like anime? go to an anime expo!\n\nI know life is more complicated than this. However, you can give it a try. Good luck!",

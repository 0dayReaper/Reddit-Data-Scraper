    "postText": "To start off, communication has never been easy for me, but I believe in giving myself credit for trying. At the age of 20, I find myself living with my girlfriend, who is truly amazing. Although I see her every day, an inexplicable sense of loneliness persists within me. Despite having had several jobs and being considered a hard worker, life has thrown numerous obstacles my way. Since dropping out of high school at 17, I've been navigating the challenging world of adulthood, grappling with economic hardships, and learning how to survive on my own.\n\nSurprisingly, my lack of formal education hasn't hindered my progress in reaching my goals. Despite the odds, I've managed to secure a decent-paying job that demands 48-60+ hours of my week, and garuntees a position in the regulated field I want to get into. With my earnings, I've been able to afford a sizeable one-bedroom apartment and own a reliable yet inexpensive-to-maintain 1995 Toyota. Considering my age, I take pride in acknowledging my accomplishments. However, amid my achievements, I struggle to foster meaningful friendships. It's not that others are at fault, nor is it entirely my own doing. I simply find it challenging to connect with individuals my age, leading some to advise me to embrace the experiences of my twenties.\n\nRegrettably, the support I seek is often overshadowed by the way I'm made to feel by those closest to me. My girlfriend, in particular, consistently undermines my self-esteem, as do most people in my life. The constant belittlement has left me feeling inadequate and unintelligent. In search of validation, I have even contemplated undergoing an IQ test, hoping for some analytical proof that would either dispel or confirm my feelings of incompetence.\n\nAdding to the weight on my shoulders, this year brought the passing of my grandmother, while my father once again battles a form of cancer, and my mother faces a diagnosis of COPD. To provide context, my relationship with my parents has always been strained. My mother, disabled due to birth defects linked to the smallpox virus, and my father, an alcoholic throughout my childhood, are individuals I am still getting to know. As the only child, and with my parents having had me later in life, their elderly years are approaching rapidly. The daunting responsibility of caring for them terrifies me, especially considering my lack of experience in even changing an infant's diaper, let alone attending to the needs of a conscious adult. Moreover, the absence of siblings or any other form of support intensifies my anxiety, as I anticipate the inevitable experience of witnessing their passing on my own.\n\nBefore the series of family challenges unfolded, my life took an unexpected turn that left an indelible mark on my psyche. At the age of 19, I bore witness to a harrowing incident\u2014a shooting\u2014while at work. The memory of that fateful day has haunted me ever since. The surreal sight of a bullet spinning on the concrete like a dreidel, akin to something out of a movie, left an indescribable imprint on my soul.\n\nThe traumatic experience has had a profound impact on my daily life. I have become increasingly reclusive, avoiding social outings and isolating myself from others. The once-vibrant spirit within me has been overshadowed by a pervasive sense of unease and vulnerability. In my pursuit of security and reassurance, I have recently begun saving up to obtain a concealed carry permit. The hope is that by arming myself, I can restore a sense of safety and control that has been eroded by the events that unfolded.\n\nDespite knowing the direction I want to pursue in life, a persistent sense of loneliness and confusion lingers. I yearn for connection, understanding, and a sense of purpose that goes beyond mere achievements.\n\nI don't really know what I'm trying to get out of saying all this, but it sure feels good to get it out somewhere other than my head.",

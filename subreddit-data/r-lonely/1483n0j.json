    "postText": "I just cant take this anymore. I\u2019m so lost and in pain. I have undiagnosed mental illness. I\u2019ll be 33 years old have zero friends, last time I went on a date I was 24.\nI have felt so lonely I can\u2019t even began to describe. No career/no job. I have been searching for job since March 2020. I got a job in Nov 2022 and was let go in March 2023. My parents do not take me seriously when I tell them I need help. I don\u2019t think they even care. I do not have a friendly relationship with my siblings. I\u2019m just so lost and I think at my age and the opportunities available in my country (India) ending myself is the best case scenario for everyone. I\u2019m sure my parents love me but they have never been there for me.  We do not have a real relationship we\u2019re we talk about our lives. I just stay in my room sometimes for days at once. I have been contemplating of doing it since I turned 30 but I used to tell myself that one day things will happen for me too.\nNow I have lost all motivation, I\u2019m nothing but a looser with no money no friends no future and worst of all no will to live. \nI\u2019m just not able to go through with it. I have been thinking of going to the mountains(Himalayas) live at the fullest for a week and then jump of a cliff.",

I thought he was annoying and didn't want to talk to him over the phone, so I just answered with a bland \"yeah\" or \"no\" whenever he said something to me. He was in China and I was in the US. When my father and I tried to visit him he passed away during our flight (our mom - his daughter - was already there and she was the one who told us).\n\nI'm 17 now. Every day, I regret the foolish and petty way I treated him during his last days. It was the last I ever heard from him. He spoiled me and my cousin and bought us food all the time when we were little before my parents and I immigrated. He taught me now to play Gomoku when I was 12 during a visit. After he gave us his set and we got back to the US I practiced and eventually got so good at it that even my dad gave up on playing against me. My grandpa was really good at it and he would've been the only person left in my circle who would've been a good match against me. If only we could have another match...\n\nYou matter. I'm so sorry that your life is being cut short by such a painful and horrifying disease and can't imagine what it must be like. You'll be in my prayers and the prayers of so many other people. Please take good care of yourself. You are not alone and you are loved.",

I am just not sure because I know it\u2019s more difficult to digest raw foods than steamed or cooked foods, so definitely ask your doctor and oncologist about all of this before doing anything\n\n[Dr. Michael Gregor did a very good video regarding diet and cancer as well.](https://youtu.be/g_JcftkFUEc)\n\nThere was a TED talk done by William Li regarding angiogenesis and cancer and the potency of cancer drugs and foods and how they stack up to one another and how food and diet can complement conventional treatment. [The biggest takeaway is the chart at 13:50 into the video.](https://youtu.be/OjkzfeJz66o)\n\nAgain, there might be factors that are unique to stomach cancer because it plays a role in how foods (and therefore vitamins and minerals) get digested so like I said before\u2026run all of this by your own doctor and oncologist first regarding this information.\n\nIt\u2019s not going to be easy, but you certainly have it in you to beat this cancer! We\u2019re all here with you and rooting for you! Never give up!",

    "postText": "God im so alone i hate it so much. I wish i had irl friends who wanted to talk to me. Who wanted to make an effort in our friendship. When i had irl \"friends\" i wss the only one making plans and stuff, now that i dropped them all no one cared to keep the friendship alive. Am i that boring? Idk what to do to make friends. Even online im alone. I suck so badly at making friends its pathetic. I just wish i had friends so bad bro. I wish i had someone to hang out with, go to the mall to eat desserts or get cute new clothes, talk ab school and the ppl we like, hang out at the pool during summer, random ft calls, sleepovers, and sm more. I hate not having friends so badly. Ppl my age r hanging out with sm friends daily. My two siblings are popular and have so many friends. What went wrong with me?? Srsly im the only kid something is wrong with. I hate being alone so much",

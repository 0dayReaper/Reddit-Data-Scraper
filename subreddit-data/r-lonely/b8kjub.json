Record the progress and do not stop.\n\n2. Show up to school again. The longer you hesitate to resocialize, the worse it gets. \nSchool might suck but it is essential.\n\n3. Work on yourself. Ain't nobody gonna love you if you don't. Workout, Meditate, Philosophy.\n\n4. You're male. No one is gonna pick you up if not you yourself.\n\n5. Reach outfor someone you can meet irl and talk to about your progress, maybe a family member or an old friend that actually you forgot of. Keep track of your progress with social interaction.\n\n6. People that do not care for you are not worth your while, ditch them.\n\n7. Do not pedestal girls.\n\n\nRise and shine. \n\nI wish you all the luck in the world.\n\nEdit: Thanks for my first gold!\n/ gold again?...thanks again!",

That means go back to school, fix your car on the weekends, get fit (if you're not), etc. Doing this stuff will build your self-confidence, self-esteem and will draw people to you.  \n\nAbout women: Learn how to be friends with a woman. Try to see her as just another person with goals and fears. Women feel more comfortable being romantic with someone they actually know. BUT this can be tricky, you're going to have to practice being reserved enough in the friendship so that you don't get friendzoned. That means don't spend every waking moment with a female friend that you might want to date. Only compliment her on things you like about her personality and do it in a way that you would tell a guy friend.  \n\nLet's talk about depression: I'm not a doctor so only take this as a possible solution. Exercise, eat healthy and get good sleep; if this doesn't work, it's time to seek a professional. Killing yourself solves nothing and robs you of your chance to make your stand in this world.  \n\nSome parting food for thought: The universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years old, so your life is literally your 15 seconds of fame. Also there's a possibility that there are an infinite number of dimensions where you don't exist and you happen to be in the one where you DO exist! Keep trying!",

Sometimes I wonder who would notice if I didn\u2019t wake up tomorrow morning, but someone will, someone cares, even if it doesn\u2019t seem like it....just take each a day at a time and focus on the good stuff, even if it\u2019s small. Congrats on starting college in the fall, hope you really enjoy it! I\u2019ve met a couple amazing people while being there and it\u2019s made the world of a difference.",

Walk up to him smiling when you do it so he doesn\u2019t expect it.  And don\u2019t stop at one punch either, repeatedly beat his face in until blood bubbles come out his mouth.  When your done give him a quarter and tell him go call someone who gives a fuck\n\nGo hit on some hot lonely housewife just to do it\n (Trust me, this ones easy)\n\nIn short, have fun if you rally got nothing to lose.

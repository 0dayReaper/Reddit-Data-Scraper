I told her about how I feel and felt really lonely these past few months. I was slipping away from her. She said she will always love me and be there for me. I\u2019m so grateful for her. I\u2019m hoping you guys have a friend like her. It\u2019ll get better. Feeling lonely isn\u2019t about you not having friends you can be the most important person on this planet and still feel lonely\u2026 but we\u2019ll push through. I believe in you",

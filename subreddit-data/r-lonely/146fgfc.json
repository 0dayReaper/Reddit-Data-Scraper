    "postText": "I'm pretty sure I don't have a disorder or anything like that. I don't know why, I just feel left out. I sit in the room and do nothing, when meanwhile the world moves and life goes on without me. I'm not sure I want to end it all. I'm afraid. I want to achieve something, but I'm afraid. I am alone. \n\nI have a boyfriend who is ready to support me, even though he doesn't understand anything. for him it is stupidity. I don't communicate with anyone except him. I can chat on the Internet, but everyone has left me irl. Someone may tell me to \"go out and make friends\", but I live in another country now. I don't know their language very well and I can't support any conversation. i'm alone my level of English does not allow me to communicate with the locals. I used to communicate with people who came from my country or speak my language. they all know each other. feeling like they've all turned their backs on me. they just don't accept me. my best friends just found company and it's unpleasant to watch her interact with someone, have fun while I sit and can't do anything.  even if I found people who weren't \"just having fun\", I would be redundant. life just goes by. I just have to stay at home, work, study while the only person from my environment (my partner) also sometimes goes to meet friends.",

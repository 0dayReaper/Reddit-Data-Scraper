    "postText": "I don\u2019t have anyone. I\u2019ve never had many friends, if any friends at all. I know that I\u2019m autistic now, but I still don\u2019t know why people don\u2019t like me. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m always alone \n\nThe one person was there; person who I loved, who I still love so deeply, abused me. He traumatized me repeatedly and is facing no consequences. No one cares what they did, and they\u2019re living without giving me any thoughts. They\u2019re living without caring at all about what it\u2019s putting me through at all. I don\u2019t exist to them\n\nThat just feels so isolating. I just wish I had support, love and safety around me",

            "comment": "You say that you don't know why people won't like you, and that's understandable. After all, it's difficult to look at yourself from an objective perspective. Often, people on the spectrum will unknowingly say things that upset other people, and will sometimes be unaware of how their words or actions might impact others. Especially for autistic people and their friends, communication is important. Ask your friends in no uncertain terms to confront you directly when something you do or say upsets them so you can rectify that behavior going forward",

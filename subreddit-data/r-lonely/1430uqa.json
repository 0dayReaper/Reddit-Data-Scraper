    "postText": "I wasn't always lonely, I used to have friends and be very social, but that changed when the pandemic started and my friends basically abandoned me. Then I started to isolate myself and became very anti-social to the point where I wouldn't talk to family and just drive people away from me. I would stay on the internet and just constantly scroll through many posts/videos that reminded me of my past. I joined this sub reddit to find people just like me, and although I found many people I also found many depressing posts that to be honest just made me more isolated from the world. \n\nThen I said \"Fuck it! \" and took a break from the internet to focus more on my self. And that was all I needed, I started working out, going outside, and meeting new people. I felt better! I had found people to hang around with and I felt more confident to the point where I have joined many clubs and sports teams! \n\nMaybe all you need is time to better yourself and stop worrying about others on the internet. Instead of scrolling and repeating the same shit every single fucking day, you could just take break and do new things that might help you find someone! :)",

    "postText": "I am a Christian that goes to church on a regular. I may not be super religious but overall, I do my best to follow the faith. As a Christian, we believe in dating with the intentions of marriage and not being involved in hookups and such. \n\nI am a person that has never dates before. Everytime I see couple (dating or married), I always get jealous and sad. What makes it even worse is my love language is physical touch and quality time. The only physical touch I will get is when I hug a friend at church but besides that, I've always felt the need to be touched in a way that's more than a hug.\n\nI just wish i can get a cuddle buddy. I would like to find a girl that can mutually agree to be a cuddle buddy with me. I'm going to be honest, I don't even care about sex. I just want to feel touched and loved. I just want to feel full instead of feeling empty, hollow , and jealous.",

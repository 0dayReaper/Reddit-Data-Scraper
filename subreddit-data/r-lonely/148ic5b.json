    "postText": "As you grow older, you have to become wiser. And a big part of that comes with setting healthy and strong boundaries. I, 27M started doing this a while back and I\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s lead me to filter out most of the people in my life. At this point, I barely have a friend or two that I talk to everyday. \nIt brings a sense of loneliness to me almost every other day, but the feeling of mental peace and quiet that you get with the absence of fake and hypocritical people in your life is unmatched. \nI suggest everyone here to do the same. One of the biggest reason we feel lonely is this. We aren\u2019t alone. We just deserve better people in our lives.",

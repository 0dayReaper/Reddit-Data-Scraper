I have been out of Campus classes for 3 months already and I have been dying to go back. (I had online classes earlier this Summer) Of course, I'm still lonely in school lol because I really have no one. Thanks to anxiety, most likely depression, my interests, awkwardness, so on. They say meet people online, but online friends seem like they're going really really great until they ghost me or get out of line in some way where I tell them it isn't going to work. Just recently, I had someone I befriended quickly online after we bonded over something we are interested in and talked for hours for a few days, the feeling was so mutual and they seemed so eager to message me back or message first, but now their facebook account seems to be erased and they haven't spoke to me in a day. :( We met on somewhere else though, then they told me their fb account so maybe I can still talk to them on the other site? But I don't know if they deleted their fb account because of me?  But this crap always seems to happen to me, like I'm really not worthy of friends. Don't even get me started on relationships, never had one lol. :( I'm a lonely boy!!! It sucks.",

I'm sorry about all of your friends that left. :( I have went on 1 date from online, it sucked, and then I have only had maybe 5 or so online friends over the years. Longest one was about 8 months but I ruined it by telling her I liked her too soon and lashing out when she wouldn't answer my messages. Honestly, I only told her I liked her just so I'm not lonely and to fill a void, which is not a good thing in hindsight. Then I had others that lasted a few weeks but I ended because one claimed to be in love with me, would smother me with messages repeated and even asked for shirtless pics. She was underage at the time and lied of her age on a dating site. And the others started making me uncomfortable. Now the online friend I met recently has got back to me briefly without me messaging first. I think she might be the best online friend I could ever ask for. They just were really busy is all. No love interest as she mentioned she has someone but I don't care, I just really want people to talk with. I want not to screw this friendship up. Probably the best one yet as we both seem happy, though it only has been at least a week or so since we started talking. And I want it to be longer. It sucks that I worry too much about every friend I make online. Even distracting myself from what I like and need to do, hovering around the phone waiting for them to message me. \n\nIn person I only ever had few friends in school or just acquaintances who'd talk to me when they see me, but then go along with their friends. I think I ruined things because I used to push people away, mainly in Middle &amp; High school, Guys who thought I was cool, and even nice Girls who seemed to like me (I wonder why cause I was quiet, overweight, and liked childish things, still am overweight, but not as much as then), I ended up being really weird and closed off to them, or just saying meanly that I don't like them. To the point that rumors were spreading around that I was gay.  I did have crushes that came &amp; went too and I never acted on them. \n\nI am going to a doctor to talk about anxiety and just all my terrible feelings with them. Hopefully they help me. What should I say to them?",

I hope your online friends stay with you even longer. 6 years is a long time. They must be something special. How did you all meet if you don't mind asking? (You can PM if you don't feel comfortable) Friendships for me were also made slightly easier when I was a kid until I hit High School. Granted, all of the friends I had at the time were school friends, as well as friends in my neighborhood for a brief period until I moved.  I felt like as the years went on, my ability to connect with others diminished. Mainly because I have gotten into such odd interests and hobbies that I'm afraid of sharing in fear of getting made fun of. And conversations with others sometimes feels like pulling teeth to me when we have not much in common. I was never too outgoing, but until I was in 4th or 5th grade I was more open with others. \n\nReally? she contacted you? What was the miracle she contacted you that day? lol. What did she say to you that made you lose trust? If she keeps on acting the way she is, I suggest moving on. I felt the same way with the friend that I mentioned talking to for 6 months. I felt too lonely to move on, so I kept talking to her when I probably could have stopped months earlier when she didn't respond to a message before I messaged first again. I was ALWAYS messaging first.",

Everybody loves good food and it's given me something to separate my mind from the rest of me. It's also really enjoyable to be able to do things for myself. Cooking breakfast gets my ball rolling to then clean the dishes which leads to cleaning other things up for a while as I listen to music. Cooking exactly what I want to eat for dinner makes me feel accomplished at the end of the night and the dishes make me want to cook breakfast, rinse and repeat. Summer's also the perfect time of year to smoke meats and there are few things more rewarding than deboning a full rack of ribs by simply lightly tugging/twisting the bones one by one. If I fuck something up, atleast I learned and I'm better at it for trying. \n\nFishkeeping is something for me to look at and enjoy completely selfishly. I find solace in providing the best environments I can for the critters I choose to keep. They're something to take care of that doesn't require walks and having your fish/shrimp breed then watching them grow shows that I'm atleast doing something right. I have periods where grocery and pet store employees are the only people I'll talk to in person. \n\nThat doesn't make me sad. I've got myself and I'm caring for my animals. I'm okay with that.",

The acquaintances from college I stupidly never asked their contacts because I didn't feel like I was close enough to ask to hang. I had friends in highschool I wasn't really close to them but they felt close enough to me to tell me their secrets. I tried keeping in touch but it was only one sided. I was the only one trying to schedule time to hang which never happened. After highschool I soon gave up on trying to keep in touch. There's one friend in highschool I still kept in contact with in college but lately it seems like he's drifting away too.",

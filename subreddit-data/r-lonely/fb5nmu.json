You guys talk every/every other day and you feel like you finally made a friend? \n\nNo you then notice they stop replying at a normal time and then you're lucky if you get a response ins 24 hours. You figure they're just busy so you let them be but you see them playing everything you used to play together with someone else or without you. You don't say anything because you don't want to be \"*clingy*\" and eventually they stop replying completely. you message them again and they completely ignore it and you're back to being lonely wondering if you're just boring, annoying or both :)",

People are always searching for that perfect someone/something, but they're really just chasing the high of novelty.\n\nAs I get older, I have a much better sense of who I am. If they're not interested in me, that's fine. I try not to take it personal. While loneliness is painful, I'd rather be alone than with people who don't value me. I've been there and that hurts a lot more.",

I have made so many plans and had to flake because of my partner and lost so many potentially great friends because of it Its not even funny.  and so now i am super lonely getting treated like shit all the time and have no friends to go to for help or comfort And my partner hates me.

    "postText": "I\u2019m a 21 year old woman with little experience in dating. I just got out of my 1st serious relationship and then I had 3 boyfriends in high school which all ended terribly because they just wanted me so they didn\u2019t feel alone. I\u2019ll also mention my looks and why I struggle: I\u2019m 5\u20191, average weight (haven\u2019t weighed myself in a while to give an accurate number but I\u2019ve been losing a lot of weight to where I went from chubby to normal), and I\u2019m very young looking, I get asked if I\u2019m still in school a lot and get told I look 12. I also have a hard time socializing, I have social anxiety, depression, and general anxiety so I struggle with making and keeping friends.\n\nI\u2019ve seen other women with different looks, personalities, and struggles talk about the times they\u2019ve been flirted with, their love interests, and their dates. I\u2019ve never been flirted with, I\u2019ve had boyfriends but they just used me, and everyone seems to avoid me even tho I try really hard.\n\nIt makes me feel like I\u2019m less of a woman that I haven\u2019t got to experience this. It makes me feel like I\u2019m this terrible beast. I don\u2019t have any major flaws in my face other than I look extremely young but I can\u2019t help that. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t make me feel like what I\u2019m supposed to be.",

I am an old man, there are times women have flirted with me and either I never realized it at the time or has flat out been told to me.\n  Another possibility is if you do look super young, it may concern men for legal ramifications.\n\n My bet is that you are more like me..we aren't picking upon.",

For example, i have friends who are living on their own and have already begun their careers, while I'm still with my parents and finishing up college.\n\nKeep working on yourself is the advice I'm trying to live by. I'm being active about reaching friends and making new ones. I don't like being the one who always has to reach out, but that isn't going to stop me from talking with friends.\n\nI think about wanting to be in a relationship a lot, because I do feel lonely at times. But I don't think a relationship will fix my sadness if I am not actively taking care of myself. Even little things that you can do to make mental health easier to manage, like improving sleep and getting some sort of regular exercise helps.",

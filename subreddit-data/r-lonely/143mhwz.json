I don't want to know anybody as they'll be exactly like the others. \nManipulate. They want me to ruin all my connection and then blame me.\nAll they're capable of is bullying and stealing. \nI'm just disappointed. \nDon't come at me with videos of people saving kittens. My fate in humanity is completely gone.\nAll my problems ALL OF THEM i've always end up solving them by myself. \nThis is going to be my last post ever.\nFIND ANOTHER ENEMY OR SOMEONE ELSE TO BULLY SO U MAKE URSELVES FEEL BETTER ABOUT URSELVES.\nUSELESS CRYING COMPLAINING JUDGING PIECES OF TRASH.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m 20 and I have never been with anyone. I keep using dating apps and they never work coz duh I\u2019m pretty unattractive. I\u2019ve been having dreams about so many random things. Like cooking with a partner, or slow dancing or just waking up. At some point, I started daydreaming. I used to have a lot of hobbies a few years back. But daydreaming is all I do throughout the day. It has started affecting my academic life as well. I worked hard to get a project for this summer. Now I\u2019m just wasting my time doing nothing at all. I know that I have to start working on my physique and my personality, but it\u2019s so overwhelming lol. There\u2019s just too much work to do. I don\u2019t even feel like starting. I wish I could talk to someone who can relate to this.",

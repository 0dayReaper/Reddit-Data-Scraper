    "postText": "Hello there, lonely souls\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI'm currently 16 and am looking for friends. I should be able to start making friends once I'm over 18 and done with school, as I will be able to travel past my local surroundings (yep, I have zero Rl friends in school). What I do mostly in my free time is either visiting my grandmas or sitting at home watching all sorts of things.  \n\n\nBut one future hobby I would like to try out in the future is dumpster diving, as it could save money and reduce the amount of time I will have to work to survive and live in the modern era, thus enabling me and anyone who goes dumpster diving with me to reduce living costs and increase their free time to travel and stuff. It's illegal in my country, so I would have to see if it's legal in a neighbour country in Europe.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r\r  \nI live in Germany, but anyone who lives in Europe is welcome to DM me, as I'm looking for people that I can meetup with in a few years to go on adventures, dumpster diving to reduce living costs when we are adults etc. You can still DM me if you live outside Europe like in the US or Canada and I will accept, but European countries are my preference (as they are closer to Germany and I wouldn't have to travel around half the planet).\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nHave a nice day and I will appreciate any DMs from similar-minded people (for now online), and non-scary people please!",

No money, no friends, no girlfriend, still a virgin, no job, and I always feel guilty. I fucking hate myself. I\u2019m a fucking piece of shit. I\u2019m a worthless little bitch. I\u2019m a 20 year old loser and I\u2019ll always be a loser. I hate myself and I hate life.",

Some people may have everything you listed and more, but struggle to sleep at night as a result of what they did to get it. Say you weren't a good person, do you think you'd have all these things? \n\nSociety puts a lot of expectations on young people, through things like social media, politics, etc. but its important not to lose your way. You may have none of these things as you describe, but whos to stop you acquiring them? You're only 20, trust me when I say you have more time than you realise to achieve your goals. \n\nIf you feel like you're at the bottom, it cant get any deeper. You have to pull yourself out eventually, be it starting exercising at gym, newfound interests/hobbies, or even a desire to better yourself. Imagine yourself in 10-20 years, no doubt you'll have become a man worthy of the high standards you set for yourself. Keep your empathy, not a lot of people have it! Also, no doubt you'll go through hardships while acquiring your goals, realise these are the trials you've been given and success will follow in time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to DM.\n\nTake care of yourself!",

    "postText": "It has been 2 years into this relationship. We are texting each other everyday without a miss and video calls in between. Although she is living in a different country, we managed to meet a few times already in those 2 years.\n\nBut last week, after a week coming back from our holiday together in her country, she confessed to me that she had a crush on a guy from her office. They had dinner together once or twice already and it started about 3 months ago. \n\nTo cut it short, we are both taking a time out from this relationship. I used to text her everyday and now it has been a week of silence from both of us. I just don't know how to describe my loneliness right now and how clueless regarding what I'm supposed to do about this. \n\nThe thought of her being normal and happy as she already had someone she likes around her just makes my heart hurt so much..",

            "comment": "Hiya,  \n\n\nSorry to hear you're going through this. Unfortunately with long-distance relationships this is pretty common. Some women have trouble not being able to be physically there with their partner(e.g. physical touch love language), others might not have this issue but most would. \n\nI think she should have told you of this much sooner. After your holiday I'm sure she felt guilty at dragging you along while seeing this colleague of hers. \n\nBy \"taking time out from this relationship\" I hope you know this means its over. This is essentially a big maybe we'll get back together but probably not, in other words letting you down gently. This woman does seem to care for you, but the long distance is more of a problem than shes letting on.  Assume its over for now. Dont go sending desperate messages to try convince her otherwise. \n\nIn this scenario this isnt a question of whether or not you need to improve, its just an unfortunate reality of most long distance relationships. You may have invested more than her, but dont let that weigh you down too much. Either way, work to improve regardless as we all should.\n\nI'm sure you learned a lot over the space of the 2 years together, use this to make your next relationship stronger! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to DM.\n\nTake care of yourself!",

I really appreciate your reply \n\nI'm 34 rn and I don't think I can go through another relationship after this. It takes so much effort for a guy to start a new relationship.\n\nTo be honest, I keep thinking about texting her everyday but I hold myself and it feels like a torture. The last time we had a video call, she was crying when she told me about that. It was like she really felt terrible about that. \n\nIs it really over? I still can't accept that reality. I think by keeping myself from texting her for a while might make her come to her senses. 2 years of memories is too precious just to let go just like that.\n\nPs: Sorry for my bad English. It is not my first language after all. I tried to DM you but something is wrong and I don't know why.",

A relationship closer to home would be completely different to this long-distance one you had prior, getting to be there with your partner is a different feeling that I'm sure you'll appreciate once you get there!\n\nYou are obviously going to want to text her, and not doing this will feel awful. I was in the same scenario when I was broken up with over text. I saw her one day and decided this is enough and sent a text trying to sort things out. All this did was lead to me making a fool of myself and resulted in a short response which was letting me down gently, this was my bad, which I realise now, I should have let her go. Breaking up over a video call is bad enough, she probably wanted to tell you on the trip (holiday) but couldn't get the guts to tell you.\n\nI don't blame you for not wanting to accept what I said, for now if it helps dont accept it, all I ask is that you keep it in mind. As a dude, pursuing a girl when she doesn't want anything more is foolish. I don't know you, or your girlfriend so maybe there is a chance. \n\nI would advise not texting her, and letting her reach out to you first. If it gets too hard for you and you have to text her like I previously did with mine, ask her for clarification on whether she wants to break up permanently, or continue the relationship, because dragging you along with \"taking time out of the relationship\" is worse than breaking up with you, and wasting your time and energy thinking about it.\n\nOther people don't seem to have had issues with Dming me but I will check my settings. Also, your english is decent no worries there.",

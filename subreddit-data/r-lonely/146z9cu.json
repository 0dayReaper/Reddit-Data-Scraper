    "postText": "I\u2019m (22m, gay) about to give up. My partner and I decided to end our 5 year relationship a 4 months ago and I spiralled. It was a toxic relationship (emotional abuse directed at me), that and compounded emotional and verbal abuse from my placement educator resulted in an emotional breakdown. My friends left me, my ex took the dog, I\u2019m living alone, and everyone I meet uses me for sex. I\u2019m not a bad looking guy, and I can carry a conversation but as soon as I try to talk to people or we meet more than once unless the  conversation turns sexual i get ghosted. Im so sick of feeling alone. I\u2019ve tried doing all the things people say like getting comfortable with yourself going on solo trips all that jazz, but as soon as I think I\u2019m getting better at there\u2019s this loneliness again that sweeps over me. It\u2019s numbing.\n\nI booked in an air bnb for my birthday the other night and invited all my closest friends. After confirmation they were coming I set up got the alcohol going annnnd one by one cancellations. I was alone in an air bnb on my birthday with an apartment full of alcohol. I was so tempted to just drink the loneliness away and stop feeling the pain and hurt but that\u2019s a slippery slope that I\u2019m on the edge of taking. \n\nI got home today and the silence just got to me. I sat in the one spot on the floor staring at the wall from 3pm to 2am. The thing is it wasn\u2019t agonising, i was tearing up but I just didn\u2019t feel anything. It\u2019s like my body was shielding me from the pain. I tried to reach out to friends again just for a chat or a coffee and nope. I have no one, and I\u2019m alone. I again started thinking of ways to just stop everything and suicide became a fixation.\n\nThe thought of ending it all just brought a feeling of relief. Just complete nothingness. Not having to constantly wonder if it\u2019s me, what about me, what I\u2019m doing wrong in my life. Not having to feel the exhaustion of my body shielding me and numbing me from the pain. Just the thought of it created the most joy I\u2019ve felt in so long because it finally gave me a solid out to this fear I have of being forever alone and this aching pain that has culminated in me skipping meal\u2019s because I know it\u2019s irrational but in the gay community thinness = value and increased social interaction ( another can of worms). \n\nI\u2019m so close to giving up because it feels like the only solution at this point that will mean I\u2019m no longer feeling anything anymore.\n\n\u2014 I am actively using headspace and a psychologist and even then it\u2019s not working.",

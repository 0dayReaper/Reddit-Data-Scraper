    "postText": "Youre not useless, and ill never forget you. I love you still, no doubt. You were right what you said until you snapped at me. You were right to have those feelings and thoughts, but you scared me. I hope you are well. I hope you have drawn near to Jesus. I hope Jesus plucks you from amongst the masses and holds you close. Idk if you will ever even see this, but idc. I truly fell in love with the person you are. I hope one day that you find that someone you so desire. I wish it were me, my love. I wish it could be so. Alas, here I type a phantom love letter to the internet for no reason other than hope.\n\nI will never forget you, and i hope that i will see you again one day.",

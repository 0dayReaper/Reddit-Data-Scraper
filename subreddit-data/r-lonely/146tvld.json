    "postText": "So I attempted moving out in my own and that didn\u2019t work. Ended up calling my mom the same day crying and now I\u2019m back home. I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll ever let me out her sight again now. I hate it here but I don\u2019t have anywhere else to go. I\u2019m thinking of just \u201crunning away\u201d and cutting off all contact with my mom. I don\u2019t really have a plan or a lot of money but I feel like I\u2019m suffocating here",

Though they know I care about them in my own little far out way. Even so I\u2019ve been the loner type not because I like being alone. But rather the peace it brings. But I\u2019ve live with my parents these last 5 years bc of college. And now I\u2019m going to graduate and head of to the military. I\u2019m honestly not scared or worried of what may come next. That\u2019s life for you. We can\u2019t expect for something good to happen rather all we can do is hope.",

But it doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t do it. All it means is we just have too build up that little bit of courage needed to take a step forward.",

That was my one opportunity to show like I can do this and be alone and I feel like now she\u2019s gonna hold this over my head the next time I say I\u2019m ready to move. I wish she\u2019d just get a life and stay out of mine. She does stuff that makes me hate her and I feel like the only choose I have to find out who I am and not who my mom makes me be, is to just up and run away and cut her out of my life or im just gonna end up living here waiting for her to die before I can do what I want to do",

My fathers to much of hard head to know when he\u2019s wrong. As for my mom well she\u2019s just complicated. My point is all of our parents are weird in their own way. While I might not understand the clinginess of yours I do understand about just wanting to find yourself.",

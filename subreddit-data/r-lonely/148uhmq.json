    "postText": "This is what i feel right now, before, I live far away my family to do contract job for few year. \n\nI didn't meet them directly for few year and only communicate trhough call/Vcall because of distance and time. I do feel lonely sometimes but i get used to it. \n\nThen after i end my contract, i decided to go back to live with my family again. \n\nAnd what unbelievable is, i feel like stranger, my family affection feel suffocating, and sometimes i feel annoyed.  It's been few month and i still feel the same. It's so uncomfortable sometime. I plan to do contract job far from home again because of this. \n\nNothing wrong with my family, it just that's what i feel. \n\nI think im getting too used to loneliness. . I don't have much friends. Most of my acquaintance are my coworker.",

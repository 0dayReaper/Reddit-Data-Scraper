    "postText": "Today I finished hooking up a temporary electrical service to my house that I'm building myself. That allowed me to get a portable air conditioner to use while it's still under construction and I'm living in it. \n\nI opened up the air conditioner and got it installed. I turned it on for the first time and sat down to take a rest. I should be happy about this but I just started breaking down and crying. I'm so lonely. I don't have anyone to share happy moments with. No one I could even tell about it. I'm so tired of being alone all the time.\n\n It doesn't help that I'm reminded that my cousin who's 10 years younger than I am is getting married soon while I've never so much as had a serious girlfriend. I'm just so tired. I'm tired of having to white knuckle my way through life because I'm alone.",

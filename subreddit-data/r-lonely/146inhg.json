I don\u2019t wish to know many people or be popular for say but I wish I could enjoy myself more for other people. The people in my neighborhood who often recognize me often don\u2019t realize that they treat me poorly. Why do they bother me so much? I\u2019ve been doing better with my mental health and I\u2019m trying hard to get even better but everywhere I turn there is something there to bother me.",

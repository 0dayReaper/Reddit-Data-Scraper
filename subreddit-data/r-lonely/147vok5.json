    "postText": "Hey people of reddit. At I came here to seek some advice for y\u2019all. I\u2019m a business student in my 2nd year. I started my 1st year with a motive to seek highest marks in all subjects and I did. I was soo motivated and focused however a girl in class approached me (she\u2019s the hottest girl in our class btw). I started to help her in her studies. After few days she started to show interest in me by asking if i have a girlfriend or not and some other personal questions. We started to hold hands in class aswell as outside college. We even went to see movies and restaurants and as every guy i started to fall for her. She even told me that i was special for her. Days passed and there was another guy she was talking to. I was already suspicious that something was fishy. At last some of my friends told me that she was also treating that say guy like she was treating me too. I asked her about the guy and she had the same answer (not to worry about he is just a friend). I knew it was a red flag and i stoped talking to her. Now i have lost all my momentum, my focus in studies and i cant stop thinking of her. Someone please give me some advice what should i do.",

Eventually you will recover to a point when you'll be ready to date again and hopefully you'll find the right person for you. That clearly wasn't her.",

    "postText": "I feel like giving up. I\u2019ve tried for almost 3 years to get over my ex and it feels impossible at this point. It feels like I\u2019m cursed to forever regret the decisions I made that caused our breakup. I\u2019m constantly reminded of her and she crosses me mind endlessly. I\u2019ve tried therapy and it hasn\u2019t helped me in the least. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore",

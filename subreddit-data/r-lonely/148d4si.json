    "postText": "I was watching a show called lockdown and started thinking about how the biggest punishment and most feared aspect of prison is being put in solidarity confinement where you're locked into 1 room, get 1 hour a day to go out and don't get to interact with other people and it's said to break down people mentally. \n\nIt made me realise that I'm essentially living out the punishment designed for the worst of the worst in society except for the fact that I don't even get the 1 hour outside, i usually do my food shopping for the month and end up staying inside and having no one to talk too at all online or irl. \n\nI don't think I'm really THAT bad but evidently society has deemed me to be undeserving of anything better than to permanently live what the lowest of the low get as a temporary punishment and it's made me feel really hopeless that after a month prisoners are said to be changed permanently, meanwhile I'm years deep in \"the hole\".",

            "comment": "Wow I never thought of it this way. That maybe explains why I have so many mental health problems, especially anger issues. It is extremely isolating and depressing being locked between 4 walls and having no one to interact irl. I at least have someone online, but it's still absolutely horrendous. Last month was especially horrendous because i was non-stop studying for university exams. I'm so done and tired and collapsing mentally, even my body is visibly deteriorating from the amount of anguish I feel, like what the fuck is this society even?! I'm too scared to go outside because there are criminals walking in daylight attacking and killing people for absolutely unnecessary bullshit, sex offenders stalking women in public while no one helps them. So many people lost the ability to talk with others, so many people had their brains literally rotted from the internet and everyone is always on the edge, always ready to attack someone, families abuse their children because they can't consider them more than an investment and all of that, just to be barely surviving in totally unacceptable living conditions. This capitalistic greedy shithole turned into an unprecedented dystopia, and regular people like us are either forced to withdraw from it completely or go insane. Humans are social animals my fucking ass, you're expected to care for everyone EXCEPT yourself. \"Fuck you and your feelings, I'm smarter/older/prettier/wealthier than you, you should listen to me!\" No one is fucking normal in this world at this point, there's nothing to do besides withdrawing yourself, because everyone is batshit crazy. You have to be perfect, funny, smart, beautiful to be accepted. All that just so some maniac drags you to the bush and assaults you. I'm so fucking sick and tired of this disgusting greedy world.\n\nSorry for the borderline schizophrenic ramble.",

When all I need and want is someone to tell me it's ok....  That I'm not alone...  Someone to at least just act like they care. \n If I can be that for you? Please dm me! Helping someone else get through or even just talk about their issues will( most of the time) be totally beneficial to both parties involved. \n I'll talk to you. I'll tell you that your good enough. I will show you how your beautiful. \nAll I ask is that someone maybe check on me sometime \ud83d\ude14  \n I can't drown my demons... They know how to swim\ud83d\ude25",

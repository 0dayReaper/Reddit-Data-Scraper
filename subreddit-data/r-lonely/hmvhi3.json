There are really  no words to describe how much I would hope every one here would be able to find the company and love they deserve.\n\nEdit2: I feel as though this post gave me good vibes today because my ex and I talked tonight on the phone and we worked things out. It seems like we are going to give this a second chance. She's coming to see me this weekend hopefully. Again, Thanks for all the positivity.\n\nEdit3: I decided not to get back together with my ex. She is not ready for the commitment which I determined after talking with her more, so I made the decision to stay friends.",

But I know that, even if alone, I can appreciate the little things like going to the grocery alone and being happy buying my favourite ice cream, or biscuits. Leaving home for a walk and smile to strangers, or dogs. I can practice drawing, play videogames, do some exercises, listening to music, fantasizing alone.\n\nAll of this, one day, will be a memory. There will be a lot of melancholy, and that's important. It's not wasted time. Spend your time appreciating these little things and I'm sure one day you'll be able to share them with someone.\n\nAnd write, write poems, stories. Draw your little adventure, grow with your memories, grow with your stories.",

I wanna say that when these moments come up, we have to learn from them. Most poets were depressed, with some sort of existential crisis, and they wrote down these emotions. It's not a cure, but it can help, it can help understand us, growing up, and to create core memories even if not shared with someone.\n\n\"Some people just find the joy in things by experiencing with others\", yeah nobody find the joy in things by only being alone, me neither. But when we cannot choose it, we should learn to share them with ourselves.\n\nThat's not a cure, that's a path. A path for staying strong, and live, day by day, even if alone. That's not easy, that's not \"lucky\". It's hard, as much as important for me to wake up the morning and to think it will be worthy.",

Sorry! \n\nGood luck in your search for happiness, you can do it. My opinion is that guy's simply have it harder in this facet of life, because I'm a believer that there are simply more men in the world(and certainly within the US) then females, no matter what the censuses want ppl to think. \n\nSo for every lonely female out there, she's got multiple guys chasing her. Whereas for every lonely male out there, he has literally nobody chasing him and instead has to join in on the chase of other girls also being chased after.",

There's online equivalents to this stuff, but it's so easy for the trolls to come out.  Hell, I do iRacing with my mic on, but I never say a word.  I just cruise around and do my own thing.",

And perhaps, if it\u2019s okay for me to suggest, you could consider getting a pet. Dogs may be typically the most affectionate per say, but there are tons of other animals. Perhaps you could even get more than one. Birds are good companions as well, along with cats. That being said I don\u2019t know if you can have pets but this is the best I can give I guess... but if you really do feel lonely and need a chat hmu!!!",

There should be a posting board (or multiple) where everyone  can post stuff out into the void of the internet, where people who wants to can read and comment on it. Something akin to this subreddit. There should also be a VC or even video function, like omegle, where people can just meet and have fun. Been trying out VRchat myself recently because I just wanted to meet some people, really makes you feel you are actually standing in front of someone.\n\nBut at the same time, having a place like this for people will allow predators to arrive and get some easy lonely people.",

That sentence sounds a little colluded but you\u2019ve always been there for yourself, you\u2019ve gotten you through the hardest times and did it on your own. All you need is yoi, when the right person comes around they\u2019ll be an additional to your life, but they aren\u2019t a necessity. Embrace the loneliness and recognize how strong you are for already getting through all of this. I have to balance myself out with this realization sometimes when I get too in my head. I want someone, a companion, just someone to *love* and you know be happy with. But we take it day by, and stay hopeful while appreciating ourselves separate from a relationship",

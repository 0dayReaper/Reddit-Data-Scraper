There's so many people in the world, the odds are in your favor. Like statistically and mathematically, the odds are higher of your finding at least one friend.",

I have some stray cats that always cheer me up and i plan on getting a pet cat soon so i can be happy cuz no friends. One day you'll definitely get a good friend but don't be too desperate.",

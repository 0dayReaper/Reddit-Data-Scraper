It\u2019s just parroting nonsense, the male equivalent to, \u201dLive Love Laugh\u201d that helps absolutely no one. It\u2019s white noise playing in the background. It\u2019s a generic response that people resort to because they can\u2019t relate to you at all, just want to hear themselves talk, and probably have either never been in your position, or haven\u2019t been for a while because they equate their success in finding love to \u2018the grind\u2019 when it\u2019s complete luck that someone gave them even the slightest time of day that snowballed into something substantial. You\u2019re overcomplicating things, it\u2019s not that deep, it never has been. It\u2019s not about being the right person, it\u2019s not even about matching with someone, it\u2019s about finding someone you\u2019re compatible with as you are. It\u2019s not rocket science but it\u2019s being funded like it is, by these dating gurus and the like, telling men and women that hey, you aren\u2019t shit and if you do these things, you will attract people. I\u2019m not even the most pessimistic person on this planet. I\u2019m relatively chill. I\u2019ve been somewhat successful with online dating as all my long term relationships, including my current one, have started on the apps. My very honest, down to earth, \u201cwhat you see is what you get\u201d profile that doesn\u2019t give a shit about avoiding selfies is proof that none of this nonsense makes any difference. We will die alone or we won\u2019t. And it has nothing to do with working on yourself, grinding, 6 figures, a 6-pack, it\u2019s all pure unfiltered BS. Just be good, and be you. Even if you\u2019re bad, there\u2019s still someone for you. Plenty of assholes with someone who won\u2019t leave them because we\u2019re all in this shitty game where love isn\u2019t guaranteed for us and we\u2019re all trying to hold on because it\u2019s better than being by ourselves. I get it and I get you.\n\n\nI just want the disingenuous, copious amounts of hope littering up the cosmos to stop with zero supporting evidence.",

Finding a hobby, exercising, eating healthy, learning new abilities etc, it all helps you to be happier by yourself.\n\nPeople won't be attracted to you just because you put in in the work to improve yourself but you certainly will feel better about your life and being lonely becomes easier.\n\n Those are my two cents",

The problem with this is that usually people who advise you to do that, are people who do nothing about themselves, or they work on themselves in a superficial way. Working on yourself has a very wide spectrum of things that you can improve, including your psychology, your patience, your communication skills, your relationship with your body, gym, intellectual skills etc. Often people who said to me to work on myself, they meant to go to the gym or something like that. It is not completely shitty advice, but it is only one thing that you can improve, and for sure it does not mean that body is the ticket for a good relationship or something. It can be that you have a nice body and be a shitty person. However, these improvements are improvements that everybody should do anyway, not because of finding a partner, but because they are humans. As you correctly said, it is just about finding somebody that feels comfortable to spend time with each other. Thus it can be that you may find a relationship despite the fact that you are not perfect in everything. However, this is not the meaning, the meaning is to do all these things because first of all they are good for you. So I agree with you in general, but I do not find it an absolute bullshit to improve yourself.",

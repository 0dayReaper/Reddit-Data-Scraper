    "postText": "I apologize for the length. I never share my personal journal entries, but I\u2019m very curious to hear other people\u2019s thoughts. \n\nI have the emotional capacity to deal with the best and worst personalities this world has to offer. I attribute that to my childhood/adolescent trauma and my adult healing. I often wonder why I\u2019m proud of being capable of \u201chandling\u201d a toxic individual. What am I trying to prove to myself? Do I think I don\u2019t deserve someone kind and gentle? \nWhen in the presence of toxicity, I genuinely love to size the individual up and attempt to identify the roots of their pain.  I\u2019ve encountered immense pain and grow curious of how much pain it takes to turn a person poisonous.  Maybe my inner child wants to know, \u201cat what point does innocence turn into violence\u201d? And, \u201cat what point does hope turn into darkness\u201d?  \nI\u2019ve never intentionally sought out a toxic individual, however, I do find that when I recognize red flags, instead of walking away I stay longer to understand why. Of course, I ultimately end up the one in pain, both emotional and sometimes physical. Sometimes my brain rewards me by convincing me that \u201cI made it out again\u201d. Sometimes I impress myself that I can still go out in the world and spread positivity to those around me that have absolutely no idea what I\u2019m battling. \n\nBut, I want this cycle to stop. I\u2019m tired of testing my limits. What hole am I trying to fill? I desperately want to find myself again, but have to try and remove myself from what I hope is my last toxic relationship.",

    "postText": "Let me be clear at first, I do not and never have thought that I am good looking. However, in my past relationships, my partners have always said things about me I could not comprehend myself. They used to always tell me things about my looks. Especially this one guy I dated, he never said anything nice about who I am, about what I am as a person, but always commented on my looks. He went really far in this. This happens more than I'd like to admit. I've had people fall in love with me, people flirting with me and people making comments on my looks. I had this one friend, my best friend, who always made comments on my looks as well. Eventually he did very selfish things to me, which I am not willing to discuss right now. \nMy point being, I feel like people sometimes treat me as a piece of meat. I feel like others minimise my personality and who I really am because they think I look good. This may seem like an arbitrary issue to some of you. But it leaves me feeling like no one really cares about the person beneath my suit of skin. I feel like I am being judged, even though not necessarily in a negative way, for the way they see me. I feel as if people only like me because of the way I look. Because of the pre-existing neurological effects specific appearance traits have on the human brain. \nI have often told my current boyfriend what I love about him. I have said it all. What I like about his personality, his character traits and his looks. However, as far as I can remember, he has only said things about my looks. I'm sure I'm over thinking this, but I feel alone in the way I perceive life, because people get blinded by things I deem arbitrary. \nI have recently discovered, by going to therapy, that I suffer from a mixture of autism and a high IQ. Perhaps this is just me acting on thoughts I should just ignore. But I have no idea what to do with the information I have been offered. Neither about my looks or my mental state. \nI feel lonely, not in a physical way, but a mental one.",

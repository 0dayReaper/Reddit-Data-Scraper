Or has an idea on why I behave like this?\n\n+ I ALREADY SEE A THERAPIST and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not lesbian.",

I'm doing fine while not in a relationship but at the same time I kinda miss being in one, but I guess I'll just wait. I don't really have any advice to offer, as I'm going through the same experience but if you need someone to talk to, I'm here",

It\u2019s your inner self liking the challenge and wanting to raise above it to feel achieved. \n\nLet one of those guy who flirt with you or pursue you to pursue you, but be clear with them that there are some challenges\u2026 and learn to let go and like being liked, get to learn the feelings and know you deserve a little hampering sometimes. \n\nIt\u2019s all got to do with your childhood. So dove in it and slowly but surely you\u2019ll change. Also you\u2019re ducking young don\u2019t worry about this shit that much just learn to be ok with being admired and learn to appreciate people \n\nAlso doesn\u2019t mean let any asshole to flirt with you of course. But don\u2019t chase ppl\u2026 or before you know you\u2019ve waste a bunch of years",

And though it may seem like I\u2019m ignoring  my partner I\u2019m not at all. I do ask her about work school and other things. And when she needs someone to talk about her struggles. I just sit and listen. I do this bc growing up I was a bit of a lonely child and I had a few other things to deal with even though I had sisters I had that loner mentality built into me. Ig what I\u2019m trying to say everyone basic dating mentality originates from their childhood including the people they put themselves around. My father was the type of guy to be a rock. I swear the only time I ever saw him smile towards me was on my birthdays and when I graduated high school. I don\u2019t hate him for it but I did end up kind of becoming similar to him. Except I talk a bit more. Though my sisters say I\u2019m a lot like him. Still though I think your the type of individual that doesn\u2019t like being showered with affection but rather know that your liked by said person and that\u2019s it.",

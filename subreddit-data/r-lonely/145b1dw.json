Medication helped me and so does doing stuff I enjoy I\u2019m glad my attempts on myself were unsuccessful they made me feel way worse if I could go back to your age and be happier I would instead of feeling like that but it took time. Life is great trust me and don\u2019t worry how ppl treat you just enjoy things and ignore them bc their comments or how they are with you holds no weight if you\u2019re happy feel better miss",

So proud you\u2019re able to open up to ppl. I met another person on here years ago she was around your age I was the same at the time we both were suicidal and till this day I still talk to her and I\u2019m glad we are here still. Life does get hard ppl will rlly disappoint and upset you even ppl close to you but it will be ok it can\u2019t rain forever things go up and down if I\u2019m having a bad week I\u2019m like \u201cwell can\u2019t rain forever next week will be fun\u201d that keeps me around keeping the understanding that life isn\u2019t always easy but we both have the strength to overcome the bs in the world. If you ever feel rlly bad tell someone eventually you will find good things in life and if it gets bad remember there are ppl who\u2019ve been where you are and moved through it you can cyote you do you \ud83e\udee1",

                            "comment": "\nFor the record though, acknowledging that you have depression is a huge step. It\u2019s hard to understand when you have it if you haven\u2019t had it before. Suicidal thoughts are a later stage of depression but the good thing is that you\u2019re still at a stage where you want to save yourself. I was also depressed and suicidal at your age. Life goes up and down. Literally only a few months ago I was crying almost every day and now I feel the happiest I\u2019ve felt in years. We are like flowers, we need the right conditions to bloom. Some flowers need more specific conditions to bloom which are harder to find. A bluebell takes more time to bloom than a rose, but does that make it less beautiful? Absolutely not. Although there is no set recipe for happiness, I can say one thing\u2026 the times I have been sad, I was not in the right environment for me. As soon as that environment changed, i felt so much happier. As a 15 year old, I understand it can be difficult to change your environment because your parents ultimately have control over your life. But you need to be blunt with them about how you feel, and tell them you need a &amp; b to feel better. If you know the cause for your sadness that\u2019s a great first step. If you don\u2019t, it could be clinical depression which you should seek medical help for. Here are some tips: 1. Don\u2019t be afraid to use the word depressed, because it\u2019s the only way people will listen. 2. YouTube self care and try to get into a routine of enjoying your solitude 3. Bullet journaling is a great practice of self care 4. Do more of what made you happy as a kid 5. Find a passion that will give you happiness when you don\u2019t have friends to 6. EVERYONE is capable of making friends. 7. Join a Facebook or Reddit mental health group so you can relate to others 8. Force yourself to do things e.g go for walk/ gym bc you feel better afterwards despite not wanting to before 9. Look into taking anti depressants 10. Make sure the people around you are aware of your mental health issues so they can be more understanding and be there for you",

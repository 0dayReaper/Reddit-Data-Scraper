    "postText": "First things first no pity part in comments I want the straight forward truth and opinions thank you. So basically my family ignores and overlooks me a lot. They don\u2019t care about what i have to say, I tried to show my mom how much leaner I\u2019ve gotten since  December and my mom 45f and sister 14f completely dismissed me and said get outta here. Not to mention my mom is constantly lashing out so I don\u2019t feel comfortable in my own house. I spend my time in my room or in the middle of the street looking like some lost child. It\u2019s tuff not having emotional support at home. I spend a lot of time online and the only ones who seem to care are these 20 yr olds. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I have no social live bc ive been homeschooled since covid and moved during that time so ill take what i can get. Yes ik these men are predators but it\u2019s either that or nobody. Now i have gotten groomed a handful of times already but life it traumatizing anyways. Regardless im tryna avoid that bc grooming sucks Lmaooo. So long story short im starving for affection, attention, support from my family, and a best friend in my neighborhood and get sexually abused online by older men the end. Damn i feel a lot better letting all that out y\u2019all should let it out too ong. Bye yall",

Not all parents are suited for this job because it's easy to f*ck but not easy to be a good example. Said that, focus your efforts on becoming independent as soon as possible not only for the money but for opening your mental space for new people that share with you the same values. It's not our job to fix our parents but is our duty to set our goals and reach for them. You have time, just don't waste it. Take care.",

            "comment": "Truth be told a lot of people feel that why at your age. I did. It\u2019s honestly just part of being a teenager, a lot of people go through exactly what you describe with your family. I was also homeschooled my last two years of high school and didn\u2019t have much contact with people my age. What finally got me out and socializing was joining a gym and a sports league. Do you have anything like that you could join? Any hobbies you are into that would get you out of the house? As far as dealing with creepy older men, I am truly sorry. Unfortunately that\u2019s part of being a young girl (or any girl) on the Internet. I know it might be tempting to entertain them, but do NOT. That is NOT the kind of attention you want or need. If you do need someone to talk to, even just a stranger on the internet, my DMs are always open. Take care of yourself.",

                                    "comment": "Technically it is, but with good intent.  \n\nPeople talk about loving one's self, but most don't know why it works.  Basically, its like that old trick:  \"You can't be sad if you smile.\"  (Props to everyone fake-smiling, looking like an idiot right now. The fact that you're willing to try is the best!)  How this works is the nerves that make the muscles in your face \"smile\" are hard-linked to the emotion of joy, so by doing one you start a feedback loop, which makes your brain feel good, which makes you feel good, which makes you smile more, and so on...    Its totally dumb and yet..  Damned thing works.  \n\nJump forward to \"loving yourself\":  Think about what it is you get from the imagined feeling of someone fawning over you.  That's validating, rewarding; it makes your brain feel good.  The problem with relying on someone else for this \"drug\" (if you want to call it that) is that, technically we're all human-ish, and humans make mistakes, don't follow through, and let one another down.  Eventually that person you're dependent on is going to fail you in some way.  So imagine how good it would be if you could rely on yourself for that hit of, \"Aww yeah!\"  \n\nIf you dress it up a different way, \"loving yourself\" is just hacking your brain with imagined (at first) feelings of subjective wellness - that thing we call \"happiness\". By being positive with yourself and the world around you, by finding that one thing in the moment that you can be grateful for and focusing on it, you can give yourself that bump of \"happiness\".  Do that often enough and you get that feedback loop and it gets easier. After a while you'll find that your world just seems more tolerable.  You'll find that its easier to find things about yourself to be grateful for. Here's the kicker though: when you're feeling better about yourself and the things you're grateful for, you actually project that wellbeing to the outside world, and others are attracted to that.  THAT is why (most of) the people that advocate for loving yourself seem to have friends and partners.  They're doing the thing! They're not shiny because the have someone, they have someone because they're shiny. \n\nNow, before anybody goes lumping me in the \"has a partner\" lot:  Nope.  Got my heart absolutely torn out 3 years ago and did not survive.  Have been doing the thing and it does work if you give it honest effort.  \n\nThe honest effort is key though.  It takes a lot of it and you sometimes need to be disciplined, because down is faster than up and you can loose a lot of your gains with a real good mope session.  You have to jump on those as soon as you detect them and just spend some time saying out loud (just thinking isn't strong enough) the things you're grateful for... Including that the people around you think your loopy talking to yourself, because, well they noticed you.  That's a \"plus\", right? \n\nBelieve me or don't, its your call.  \n\nTLDR: Loving yourself is just tricking your brain into defaulting to being positive and making yourself attractive to others through practice.\n\nEdited for spelling &amp; grammar -ish.",

I mean reading here its the same for me, unless I reach out to people it is rare I hear from my kids, family, etc...yet I also understand I don't expect them to stop living their lives either and no it's not an excuse, at least I don't think it is....my youngest does with a text from time to time, my middle one calls when he's on the road late cause he knows I am awake...but beyond that.....nothing....last time I was with someone was 6 yrs now....I have no clue what it feels like to be hugged, or hold hands, or things like that, and I know I would probably start crying if that happened, like a big baby...but I know at my advanced age (62) and being disabled with degenerative disc disease...well I don't expect that to ever change. I play my video games, watch my sports on tv(haven't been to a game in over 2 yrs). What's worst I think is I miss going to outdoor theatre, sitting in a park hearing the laughter &amp; walking hand in hand walking thru a museum. There was a commercial of an older couple walking hand in hand thru the park &amp; it would make me cry.....I get it in away, I'm older, disabled.....so I get it...but doesn't change the feeling.....God I am sorry I got carried away....but here is one place I know there are people who understand... and I miss being that special person....but I miss more having someone to show, tell, see, be with so I can make them feel special too.....I wish everyone here all the very very best....be safe....and for those younger people out there....don't give up like me...it might take you awhile to find, I mean I was in my 40's before finding the woman of my dreams, she is just in heaven now....so you can find it.....please don't give up....you'll regret it....I mean seriously, look at me.....",

To have a girl, only want me, want to spend time with me over anyone else, hang out with people WITH HER, meet her family, build our own family, not have to worry anout getting fucking cheated on everytime she goes wherever she goes. Just to have that deep trust is priceless. Anybody can say *i love you* but to be trusted and to trust is an entire nother realm. It breaks my heart to see people that are yearning for solidarity and comfort. Im right in the same boat with you, fren. It hurts. And some people just wont understand.",

I have mental illness and one of my habitual thoughts is that I am not enough for anyone to love or care about. So even though I am proven wrong all the time, I still believe this thought process. It sucks, but I know you can get past this. I believe in you and I believe in myself that we can get better. I have unconditional acceptance and love for you. Be good to yourself.",

I want to have someone in my life , but I don't know how..",

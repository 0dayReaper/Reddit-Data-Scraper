    "postText": "Why is it that my peers have so much friends, i always go on instagram everyday and see everyone hanging out with their best friends, friendgroups, and etc living their teenage summer dream while I\u2019m stuck at home with no one to hang out with the 3rd summer in a row. I just don\u2019t get why I don\u2019t have anyone to talk to and anyone willing to talk to me. I just don\u2019t get why I don\u2019t have anyone to post and anyone posting me. It\u2019s hard being an extrovert with absolutely 0 friends. I just want to prove to people I am good enough. I try to fool myself and tell myself social media is not real life but those people clearly are living their best life. But I\u2019m just stuck at home laying on bed by myself again with my toxic immediate family whom I\u2019m not even close with. :(",

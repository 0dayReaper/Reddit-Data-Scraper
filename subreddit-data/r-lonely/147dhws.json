    "postText": "I\u2019ve focused on myself for years and I love what I do for work and who I have in my life but my biggest hindrance is that for some reason dating apps don\u2019t work for me and I have social anxiety so flirting with women in person is tough unless I meet them online first.\n\nI really wish I knew what to do. I miss companionship. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m just not worthy of love. I just turned 30 so I know I have all my years ahead of me but I just wish someone would come out of the wood work and let me love them like no one has ever loved them. But it\u2019s okay, people don\u2019t owe me a thing. Im just sad and lonely.",

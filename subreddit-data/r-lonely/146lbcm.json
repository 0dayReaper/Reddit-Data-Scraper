I miss feeling like I'm worthy of people trying for me. I miss wanting to try so hard for someone without feeling like I'm begging for them to care. Even though I am begging for them to care.",

I've realized I can't be so reliant on someone to keep me in a good mood, and to cater to all my needs. Being single for the last few years has definitely helped. My advice, don't put all your eggs in one basket. Take it slow when you meet someone new",

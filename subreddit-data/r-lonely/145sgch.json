    "postText": "Ok reddit I need your help. I am a 28 y F and I have started horse riding in the past year. I keep the horse at a farm owned and run by a girl I semi knew and went to school with. She is 25, if age matters here. I am just starting out and she\u2019s been very helpful and has given me much more of her time than I pay. I\u2019ve always been very openly appreciative of it. I felt like we have formed a friendship as we are similar ages and see each other weekly and sometimes go for rides together. I am a dentist and decided to pay her back by giving her one of her two surgical wisdom tooth extractions for free. I would have done both for free if I had extracted the teeth but these were tricky ones and I had to have another dentist do them. He needed to be paid so I paid him for it. She seemed very grateful and this was about 2 months ago. \n\nI have known her for coming up a year. She has never followed me back on Instagram but we are friends on Facebook and we usually use messenger to communicate. The last 5 weeks I haven\u2019t been up to the farm as I have been overseas. I noticed today I haven\u2019t seen any of her Instagram stories in a while, I couldn\u2019t find her page, got a weird feeling and had my partner check and turns out she\u2019s blocked me. She also made me unfollow the farm page I follow. \n\nI don\u2019t know what has happened. I feel like I have always been friendly when at the farm. I have anxiety and this is kind of making me spiral. Is it because there was something she didn\u2019t want me to see? Am I that awful of a person to be around? I did say I was interested in a horse at the farm and looks like she\u2019s been training it \u2026 is it as shallow as she didn\u2019t want me to have this one? It all sounds really superficial and silly? \n\nCan anyone provide some insight? It would be much appreciated",

I'm pretty sure that she's not spending her days thinking of you or your relationship, what to do, do I block, do I not... In all likelihood there's something else going on, some other source of stress that caused a chain reaction that eventually resulted in a decision to remove you from her life.\n\nYou've probably had bad days yourself, the ones when people shouldn't approach you and if they do, even if they didn't do anything wrong, they end up getting hurt. I think that that's what's happening here, it's probably some bigger change that among other things caused your contact to end. I could be wrong, there could be something else she has specifically against you, but that's not necessarily and that doesn't have to be your fault. Don't stress too much about things beyond your control.",

It is a good reminder that indeed, other\u2019s worlds don\u2019t revolve around me \ud83d\ude05\n\nA confusing thing is, however, when I messaged her after this post about coming back to the farm tomorrow she said \u201cYay! It will be so good to see you!\u201d And I thanked her again for looking after my horse, and she said \u201cIt\u2019s always a pleasure!\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s very confusing",

I've struggled with overthinking stuff myself so I can relate and I'm purposefully a bit harsh so that I could possibly knock that idea out of your head. \ud83d\ude05\n\nJust in general do what's up to you and don't go beyond that. In this case you did right, you've reached out and it even resulted in a possible success. But even if it didn't, you did your part and that's where your responsibility ends. I don't shut my door to others even if they shut theirs to me.\n\nAnd her response suggests that there's indeed something else going on. She is probably going through something so I'd try to be there for her, not necessarily to solve it for her, but just to be together and share the burden if anything. All good stuff. \ud83d\udc4d",

Or maybe she is a bad person herself or something else.\n\nMy point is, things happen and unless you can't ask her themselves there is no point of thinking much of it since you don't know what happened exactly. You did nothing wrong or sort of thar and it's enough. So be cool and live your life. Be a happy dentist and pluck her tooth next time if she comes over at your place.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m always irrelevant to others at school. I don\u2019t understand why people don\u2019t like me or even pay attention to me. Yes, there are people who might talk to me in class because I sit next to them but I really have no true friends. On social media my peers get attention and messages but nobody will even ask me a single question on my sendits (I often have to ask them to).  I am never the first choice when it comes to hangouts and stuff. Feels like even if I\u2019m kind people overlook me. I used to have friends but most of them moved on, became popular, and barely talk to me anymore. What\u2019s the point of even having \u201cfriends\u201d at school if they treat me like this? Theres maybe two people at school who genuinely care about me. Yet it feels like they still prioritize other people over me. Ok, I get it I\u2019m not the only person in peoples lives but is some attention too much to ask for? People say I\u2019m irrelevant and they think I suck at the things I do even if I\u2019m skilled. I\u2019m going to try and improve my body and mind physically mentally and spiritually but will it really change the way people think about me?",

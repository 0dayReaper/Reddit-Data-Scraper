    "postText": "This is my first post ever so I hope it follows the rules and I\u2019ve posted it to the right place. \n\nSo I\u2019m in my late 30s, single and am living in a different country.  All of my best friends have now moved across the world. Even though I have been in this country for six years, I don\u2019t really have any close friends, all the friends that I have made have gotten married and gone off and had children. And when I do get to see them it\u2019s like for four hours on a random Sunday morning Once every six months. I am lonely and have been looking to date someone on dating apps. I have been successful a few times. I dated this kind guy that had to leave the country for awhile and during that time we kept in touch texting and he told me that he felt that I was depressed and talking to him was my only joy or something that I look forward to each day. And I guess that put pressure on him. now I\u2019m dating somebody else and he is really kind, and I hope that it works out, but he is always on the move when he\u2019s not working, he\u2019s out with his friends, exercising, teaching courses in the evening that interest him. I am worried that he will think the same thing as the last guy that I dated, and to be honest, I only ever do anything with him and I anxiously wait to see him again, but I don\u2019t want him to think that he is my only source of entertainment and joy because I can understand that that would be quite a lot of pressure to put on someone. I have been single for many years and I spend all of my time by myself. I go on day trips, I visit different countries by myself, do anything and everything by myself and to be honest I am just sick and tired of doing shit by myself all the time. I take no joy doing stuff by myself anymore and making friends this age is difficult (I\u2019ve tried met ups and friend dating apps with no luck). Anyway, when this new guy asks me what I am doing or what I\u2019ve done on the weekend, I lie and tell him that I have visited some friends that don\u2019t actually exist, or I\u2019ve done something with some friends\u2026\n\nIs this okay? I can\u2019t imagine that I\u2019ll be making any friends anytime soon so is it okay to continue like this?  I wish I could just be honest with him but it may not be in my best interest..",

You say that you do day trips and trips to other countries by yourself. Are there any travel clubs there? Finally, it really is not a good idea to have made up friends as the person you are dating will likely want to know more about them eventually. It would not be a bad idea to come clean about that and also *why*. If he is worthy of a relationship, he will understand.",

I am in therapy since two years back, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s helping or not. I have a lot of trauma from my childhood and I will never be able to move on from that. I really want to die, I don\u2019t know how to explain it but it\u2019s like I\u2019m just waiting for the right moment to kill myself.\n\nI don\u2019t know what I wanted to say with this post but yeah whatever.",

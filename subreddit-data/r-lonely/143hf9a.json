    "postText": "Is it ironic or a coincidence that the 988 crisis line prompted me to finally make a plan to end my life? I could live alone, but I choose not to. A life alone simply is not a life worth living anymore. Last year on my 45th birthday, after years wasting money on therapy and contacting the crisis line, I promised to give it one more year. If I didn't have quantifiable proof things would \"get better\" and I wasn't alone on my 46th birthday, then I would buy a gun and end my life. My birthday is on Friday and I bought the gun today. \n\nI didn't really think things would end this way, but I guess I should've expected it. I don't have living family and or friends. I've closed all my accounts and have no loose ends. No one noticed the suicide notes I posted on social media, but maybe someone will read them one day. Deep down, I know that, realistically, no one will even notice I'm gone. My body won't even be found for weeks or months, if ever. But it is what it is. I'm kind of relieved that while I had 46 birthdays completely uncelebrated, I won't have to experience the 47th.",

While I did make changes and I did seek help, but it only reinforced every \"bad\" idea I had about life and people. Like I don't belong here.  \n\n\nHas it been worth it?, eh, depends on view, only thing that don't make me regret it is that within those 10 years. I saved someone's soul they would say, but kinda at the cost of my own. I keep doing that crap too, save people at the expense of my own soul, where nobody will be saving mine, Even if wanted to, I don't think anyone knows how, would be able to or care to for that matter.  \n\n\nEither way, I hope you find peace, in whichever direction you go.",

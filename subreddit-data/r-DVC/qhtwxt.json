If you don't see the target school, that means there was no contract between that school at DVC. That means there isn't really a set requirement, so you should contact the target school.\n  \nassist.org\n  \nFeel free to dm me if you need help.",

Do you have a school in mind you want to transfer to? you'll want to use the IGETC papers to figure out your requirements to transfer as a junior. \n\nassist.org is where you'll find transfer requirements for your major and school. I reccomend printing it out so you can highlight what you completed and plan out your spring semester. \n\nI'm just now taking statistics (also a psych major) and its my 2nd year of college. don't sweat it too much you got this!!",

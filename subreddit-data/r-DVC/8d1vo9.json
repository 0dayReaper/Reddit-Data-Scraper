I live in the Antioch/ Pittsburg area, and am thinking of cc after high school. \n\nIt would make sense to go to LMC due to the easy drive, but many people have been saying that DVC is a better option that's worth the commute. \n\nSo, I ask you.. What benefits does DVC provide over LMC? \n(I will be entering as a comp sci major and hope to transfer to Berk, LA, or any top privates)\n\nThank you for your help!",

            "comment": "I heard LMC is as good as DVC. Only reason why people come here is because of transfer rate from DVC to UC. UCs MUST draw certain amount of transfer from CC and among those, certain amount must come from DVC. Personally, if you live too far, I think alternative of LMC is fine. It's pretty hard to commute. It's up to you to believe or not in this \"transfer rate\" of DVC.",

            "comment": "The science programs at DVC are top notch, like fantastic. The reason they have such a high transfer rate is because they feed Berkley, Davis, and other U.C.'s science major. I was incredibly satisfied with my education there and I would definitely recommend DVC for all of your STEM type classes. It's worth the drive for sure. The math department is great, the mathlab is great and when I came to my current school(chico) I was OVERprepared, we had a 3rd year statics class that took a whole semesters and I already knew every bit of it from physics at DVC, we covered it in 2 weeks...\n\nI can't really comment on LMC as I never took a class there and don't want to talk down on something I don't know about. DVC prides themselves on their STEM programs though.\n",

            "comment": "Comsci IMO was taught better at DVC then how programming is taught at my current school (SJSU). One thing going for DVC is that I can vouch that at least 1 professor there actually teaches at UC Berkely (Speliotopoulos when he teaches physics). At least when I took him a few years back, it was nice to know how our grades were relative to the grades his students at UC Berkely in the same subject were\n\nedit: my opinions speak moreso on how the computer engineering department at SJSU teaches programming on the early stages and not the CS department. Though I've heard colloquially (via students and professors) that CS students, at least at SJSU feel less motivated",

            "comment": "It all depends on what your major/program goals are. Most programs are available at both campuses, but there are some notable exceptions, like no nursing at DVC (but the have dental hygiene instead). It's also common to take classes at both campuses, especially when a class you need at your primary campus is already full. There is no issue transferring units in between colleges for graduation/transfer requirements (I did my last class for my AA from DVC at LMC).",

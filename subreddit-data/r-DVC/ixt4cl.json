So i don't think i'll need to test out of that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnglish however I'm not sure. I want to be able to take eng 122 and eng 123 because thats all that is required for most comp sci programs, and they require two semesters of english anyways so i might as well not test out of that and just take the two semesters with 122 and 123 since they're required anyways. (I plan on starting with 122)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould I take some IGETC/GE over a winter session? It feels like a hack since i would get the units within a shorter time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni'll probably end up taking a business or econ class as well. econ actually comes with the igetc thing, business ill just attach. should i take econ micro or econ macro?",

Make sure you register for classes the second you're able to so you can get into good classes (ratemyprofessor). Cs major just pm if you have questions",

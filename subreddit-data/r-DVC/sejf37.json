    "postText": "I submitted my pre req form for COMPSC-165, but I got denied because it said that the cs dept doesn't allow ap scores to be counted. I talked to one of the professors about the course and he said what I learned in ap csa already covers a few sections in this course. I emailed back to DVC about this and am still waiting for a reply, but does anyone know how else I might gain eligibility?",

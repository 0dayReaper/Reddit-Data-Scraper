He teach very well though, definately not an easy class. I would say he is much reasonable and better than other professors.\n  \nTips here: his exams are hard. Very hard, but reasonable. He won't give you something you haven't seen yet. Most of exam questions comes from text book optional homework. He grades really slowly. REALLY. When taking final on the last day, (5th exam) we did not get 3rd exam score back. He grades harshly on minor details. Make sure you include all small things like arrow signs on vector, labeling axis, and writing QED at the end of proof.",

Most of them are. Still, don't bully somebody for trying to help.\n\nAlso, remember that these spambots will continue until yours stops. Do the right thing, for the community. Yes I'm holding Reddit for hostage here.\n\nOh, and while i doo agree with you precious feedback loop -creating comment, andi do think some of the useless advide should be removed and should just show the correction, I still don't support flaming somebody over trying to help, shittily or not.\n\nNow we have a chain of at least 4 bots if you don't include AutoMod removing the last one in every sub! It continues!\n\nAlso also also also also\n\nHave a nice day!",

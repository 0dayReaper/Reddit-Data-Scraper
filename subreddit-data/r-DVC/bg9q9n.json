    "postText": "Hello all. I am a current Junior at Dublin HS interested in taking CS courses at DVC. Can anyone inform me on how the enrollment procedures work for high schoolers. I have given a list of desired coursework to my counselor to get approved and have filled out the online application. Online, all it says is that I am supposed to walk in on the 29 of May during registration for high schoolers and turn in my paperwork. Is this correct because it seems awful late compared to other Community Colleges such as LPC. Can someone guide me in the right direction? Thank You!!!!",

I don't want to say this, but certain people just learn a lot quicker, because of their good logical minds. Some people didn't have opportunity to develop this, or will never dev (in which case, should concern about taking CS as major).\n  \nI know it sounds like a-hole speaking here, but with no logics, coding is impossible to learn. However, many people do develop these skills as taking classes. Here are some tips:\n  \nIf you really liked using theorems to prove/disprove stuff from geometry, you will probably like coding.\n  \nTry codacademy (any language. Prob c++) or scratch (made by MIT). They won't teach everything in those classes, but it gives some heads up.\n  \n.\n  \nSo going back to original question, 110 should be easy or at least do able. They mostly handle logics such as if \"this\" then do \"that\"' or repeat certain tasks multiple times. 165 usually uses abstract ideas that are less used in real life. Usually good math people do well here. Most of time though, if people do well in 110, they do well going forth. So I would say try it. It worth trying.\n  \n(It became a lot longer than I initially started. I don't know if that helps at all. Feel free to pm me)",

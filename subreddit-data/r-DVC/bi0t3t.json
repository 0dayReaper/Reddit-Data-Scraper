    "postText": "I saw a post about this earlier but I wanted to change the scenario a bit.\n\nHi, I am majoring in Business Administration and Computer Science and I live in Antioch.\nMy issue is commute and my majors.\nWhat im asking is whether the commute is worth it (I dont care about transfer rates at the moment, other reasons would be helpful) and if the compsci and businessadmin programs are good at DVC. Based on the commute issue as well, is it possible to have a flexible enough schedule while commuting so far? Or am I able to take the major in pieces like, I focused on one major and completed it at another university?\n\nThanks.",

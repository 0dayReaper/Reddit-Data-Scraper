All the time I\u2019ll see someone sitting behind a desk on campus asking if I want to sign a petition to stop climate change, stop plastic from getting into the water, register to vote (that\u2019s real but that\u2019s how they lure you in), and etc. I\u2019m like 90% sure they\u2019re hired to by someone who\u2019s selling your info. Do I sound crazy?",

There are businesses who specialize in petitioning who have workers which are the people you see in front of the school or at Safeway or whatever. The workers are generally paid per signature as incentive, like a buck or two per signature per petition. The interest contracts with these companies and that\u2019s how that all works.",

    "postText": "Hello, I am planning on transferring to a UC school and am currently completing the IGETC.  I have also completed most of the transferable classes for my major (biology).  I was wondering if there is any purpose in turning in a form to get any of the degrees they offer that I have completed the requirements for (AS for biology, AS-T for biology, etc.) I realize that the AS-T is only really helpful for transferring to CSU schools so I don't really see a point in getting that degree or any of the other degrees.  They aren't useful for anything else if I'm planning to transfer to a UC school, correct?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, for the IGETC, do I need to fill in a 'Petition for Certificate of Achievement/Accomplishment'?  Or can I just turn in the   \"IGETC/CSUGE CERTIFICATION REQUEST \"  form when a UC college requests for it.  In other words, is there a formal 'i completed the IGETC' degree form that I need to turn in before colleges start requesting to see my completed IGETC.",

            "comment": "My thought is if you completed the required units for a degree and/or a certificate, why *not* get it? It's free to apply for them. I picked up two AA's as I transferred, and having also since completed my bachelor's I kind of consider my AA's like they were additional minors. Plus, there are many jobs that require at least an associate degree, so if you have one it just gives you a little extra edge along your way.",

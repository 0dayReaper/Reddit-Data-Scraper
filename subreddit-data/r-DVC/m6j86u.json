I live in Brentwood and was wondering whether or not it\u2019s worth the commute to attend DVC or if LMC will be sufficient for me to have the tools to transfer into a UC. I appreciate the insight.",

            "comment": "Most people already gave lots of good advices. I'll just let you know that UC HAVE to accept certain amount of students from community college as transfers and among them, UC HAVE to accept certain number of them from DVC, by law.\n  \nThis doesn't guarantee anything, but it naturally makes it easier to transfer from DVC to UC (aside form other benefits others have wrote). So that's one of reasons why people recommend DVC over other CC unless it's really difficult to attend there, like long distance, for example.",

As others said, go by what [assist.org](https://assist.org) says in terms of transferrable courses.\n\nDVC has some fantastic chemistry and physics instructors. Also some great humanities instructors. Math can be hit or miss. CS and engineering are not fantastic, but there are a couple good instructors you wouldn't want to miss.\n\nSince you're aiming for CS and only need humanities, math, CS, and physics courses, you would not be missing out on much if you mainly did LMC and saved yourself the commute. I'm not sure how the traffic is from Brentwood, but remember to factor that into your commute estimates.\n\nI can DM you some instructor recommendations if you like.",

I also knew quite a few people who would take 20+ units and we're able to transfer a bit quicker than I did, it all depends on your goals and commitments outside of schooling. \n\nAs far as helping me the most, it'd be hard to point to a single class or something like that and say that's been the most beneficial. I've already leaned on the material I learned from all of my programming, circuits, math and physics classes I took at DVC. Overall DVC definitely taught me how to learn and take school seriously after just getting by in highschool.",

What are your thoughts about Physics 130 and Math 292 this summer?  Would be super interested in your recommendations for math and physics teachers for Math-292, Math-194, Math-294, Phys-130, Phys-230, Phys-231, Engin-136, Engin-230.  I was hoping to transfer in Fall 2022, but thinking I may have to push it to 3 years... Thanks in advance for your help.",

If you took high school physics or physics 129 and are confident in the material it's probably doable but still not ideal. Calc 3 seems to be hit or miss for people, I didn't think it was too bad but some friends have said it was the hardest part of the calc series for them. Try to look into the material and see if you think you can handle it. I'd recommend checking out the university physics and calc books on openstax to get an idea of what it might look like. \n\nI took Ted Nirgiotis for the calc series and enjoyed his class. If he is still there and runs his class the same way he assigns no homework, your grade is made up of weekly quizzes and exams which I guess can be a pro or con depending on who you ask. \n\nAs far as physics goes, Evan Large is fantastic. I took him for 129 and he also runs the physics tutoring department. Also highly recommend Kit Colwell, I took him for 130, 230 and 231 and also ended up doing a research project with him. Can't go wrong with either of them. \n\nFor engineering, I had a good experience in Seyyed Khandani's programming for engineering class and wanted to take him for circuits but not sure if he teaches it. Ended up taking it with Chong-Horsley and it was fine.",

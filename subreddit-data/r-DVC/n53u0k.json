    "postText": "Hey everyone, \n\nThis is probably a really long shot, but I'm wondering if anyone here is taking Physics 130 during the summer or knows someone who is currently enrolled in the class. Unfortunately the waitlist is already  full, and  I really need to take this class this summer, otherwise\u00a0it will set back my graduation\u00a0date. I'm willing to pay someone who perhaps does not need to take it as urgently as I do to drop it. Pls pm me if you are interested, or know someone who might be. Thanks.",

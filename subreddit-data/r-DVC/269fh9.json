    "postText": "If you weren't aware, there is talk about gutting the Media Lab, which is where students in the Broadcasting and Film departments are able to borrow and use equipment to work on projects/assignments. This lab is located next to the Main Computer Lab, under the Library. Students are able to check out films for classes, and also check out videography and photography equipment to use in classes related to Broadcasting, Film, and Digital Arts.  \n\nIf you also weren't aware, there was a petition and posters up in the Media Lab trying to drum up support against the closure, which DVC President Peter Garcia physically removed from the Lab.  \n\nTo me, this is a blatant attempt to stifle dissenting student and staff opinion, and an outrageous action on the part of the administration.",

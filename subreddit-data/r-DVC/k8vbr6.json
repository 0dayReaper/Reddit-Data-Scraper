    "postText": "Some context; in Math 119, was recently diagnosed with a learning disorder (official on Dec 1), and have had a low grade since October/November.\n\nI have my accommodations in place, but I was told that there's no way to fight for my grade once they're finalized, which means I'm screwed out of money if I fail this semester (thanks to DVC's lack of learning disorder specialist. They won't hire till spring). Because of this, I'm trying to make up my missing work. Whenever I turn in something, it goes from a 0/10 to 5/10, for example, and my grade *should* go up a bit, right? Nope. It was 56.98% before one homework assignment was turned in late and graded, and it's now a 56.57%. I can't figure out why turning in homework is hurting my grade like this, when the zeroes are supposed to be hurting it more than a graded assignment. My grades are being shown with the zeroes, so it makes no sense that it's going down when a zero is replaced with a higher grade. It's making me not want to do any more work to try and save my grade, and I seriously doubt that passing my final exam will bring my grade high enough.",

                    "comment": "It's only 10%, but I'm still really confused as to why it's even taking my grade down after getting an increased grade on it. I have a shitload of zeroes right now, which is why I'm trying to figure out if it's worth it.\n\nI can't afford to retake the class either. I have to take several more math classes, and I can't go anywhere with my major unless I pass them. This is also technically my second time taking this class, but I had dropped it in the spring when they offered refunds halfway through the semester. It's also causing way too much mental stress, so repeating it will only make it worse, even if I have accommodations from the beginning.",

I definitely wouldn't feel confident, but I really don't have much choice because of financial and mental wellbeing.

At this rate, I need all the points I can get to try and pass, which is why I was debating. I don't see a point if late assignments are only going to take my grade down despite being marked as zero at first. Still can't figure out why that would even happen.",

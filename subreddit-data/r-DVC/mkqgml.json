    "postText": "Hey there folks! \n\nWas planning on taking classes over the summer, and was wondering whether it'd be a good idea to take Diff Eq and Linear Alg together, or just Phys-130. Not sure if I could handle all three, especially since I've heard about Phys being a filter class. On the flip side, I'm not super hyped about the prof teaching Diff Eq this summer (Prof Lum iirc). I guess I could take Math-292 and Phys together, but I honestly know nothing about the difficulty of those classes... \n\nAnyone got any advice or info about the classes?",

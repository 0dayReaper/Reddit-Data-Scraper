    "postText": "Hi, everyone.I\u2019ve graduated from Chinese high school and I didn\u2019t think the classes I took could  be admitted by DVC.\n\n\nSo I took the DVC\u2019s math self-placement today.But they didn\u2019t ask me any math questions!!!\n\nInstead they directly recommended me to take math 121, which is so frustrating because I\u2019ve already learnt a lot about calculus and I have to pay extra money and waste time on the knowledge I\u2019ve known.\n\n\n\nDo I need to try other community colleges? I only applied DVC and had no idea why this would happen. I already emailed them but I really want to hear about ur guys advice.\nPlease help me. I really appreciate it!",

They should take it from there, they might need extra info from you. I have a friend who went thru something similar and he goes to DVC.",

He needed that because he was out of hs already \n\nI didn\u2019t need to show mine because the counselor was actually at my hs before I graduated  and could just fix the mistake since they knew I was passing pre calc, and didn\u2019t need to take it again .",

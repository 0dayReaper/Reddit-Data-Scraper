Congratulations to everyone who got into the schools that they wanted to, and commiserations to those who didn't.\n\nPersonal brag: I got into Berkeley for CS! Fuck yeah, boys! I couldn't be more happy.",

For what it's worth, there is a guy in my calc 3 class who was accepted with just under a 3.9. \n\nIf you know people, then you should try to get an internship this summer. If not, you can do what I did which was find any job with consistent hours (I joined a construction crew and later I was an engineering tech). \n\nThe only other thing that I can say is that spending a lot of time studying and trying to learn the material is what I focused on. In any case, GL!",

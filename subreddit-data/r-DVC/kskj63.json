            "comment": "I did 165 over the summer and the programming classes work better when they're accelerated. Over a full semester they're almost too spaced out. With the accelerated courses you learn related concepts at the same time. That said, if you don't have much time for school outside of work/life, you'll be losing a good amount of sleep to keep up with the homework.",

            "comment": "I've done COMSC-200 over the Summer 2020 alongside COMSC-150IO. I previously took COMSC-165 and COMSC-150K over Summer 2019. I looked at the syllabus and I couldn't believe that it said like \"70 hours/week\" time commitment but it turned out to be real. It was my hardest class to date, and I got my lowest grade in it.\n\nYou move very quickly, 1 unit every \\~2 days and the midterm/final comes by fast. Course material is very interesting though, it will prep you to be a great C++ programmer and turn in better code for COMSC-210 and beyond, not a necessity though. \n\nIf you're willing to take it over the Summer to experience the rigor go for it. I hope it prepped me well if I can transfer to a good School for Computer Science.",

            "comment": "200 covers some of the more advanced components of programming, but some of the most vital (which is object oriented programming and what you can do with it)\n\n&gt; Is it offered\n\nnot sure, havent seen a dvc catalog in like 7+ years\n\n&gt; how suicidal is this\n\ni like to say that if you had a decent time with the previous classes, 200 shouldnt on paper be that difficult, despite a more condensed schedule. but thats on a person to person basis.",

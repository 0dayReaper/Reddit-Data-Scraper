            "comment": "I feel bad for you, and you do have chance to appeal, but here is what I think of the professor's reasoning, so that you can prevent these issues next time:\n  \n1. Missing assignment means you had your chance to bump your grade up. Usually professors offer extra credit assignments to round grades, but missing assignment means you could have turned in your late assignment or etc before asking for extra credit. (Maybe you missed those assignments because of your family situation, and in that case this isn't the issue)\n  \n2. As it is stated, the semester is over, and it seems like the professor does not have any power to change your grade. This is due to the system, so you can't really blame him/her. What you could have tried is let them know of your grade situation is so that they can give alternatives in prior.\n  \nWell, it already happened, but I hope these help your future semester. For this current issue, you can go to department and ask for your grade change. I don't think your professor can help you. You should go asap, as it will be harder to appeal as time goes.\n  \nIf it doesn't go well, honestly, it doesn't really matter too much. 1 or 2 B's won't affect your admission too much. You can even write why you ended with this grade in transfer application (and yes, they do read them). It is still worth a try, so visit the department asap (ideally the department head). Good luck",

If your professor is the the chair, then it's very likely nothing would change. She has all power in the department so unless dvc admins force the department, it won't work. And dvc admins will prob say \"go ask department for help\".",

You can claim that you are being [discriminated against in terms of grading under title IX, her treatment of you based on extenuating circumstances is unfair, she is lying to you about your grade being set in Stone. She refuses to give you an extension or an excused grade on an assignment based on circumstances you could not change](https://www.dvc.edu/about/safety/services-and-information/clery-act.html). This report would go to the Vice President of Equity and Student services.\n\nAccording to the [Student Code of Conduct](https://www.4cd.edu/gb/policies-procedures/student/S3027.pdf) article XVIII states that calendar restraints may be extended with the agreement of both parties. The wording and context of when this is applicable is vague though. However teachers have until Wednesday the 14th to finalize grades.\n\nAlso check out the table of contents of [this document](https://www.dvc.edu/communication/pdfs/22-23-chapter-2.pdf) and the end of page 32 (17 of the pdf).\n\nI think some policies need their complaint or report submitted by the end of the term, which is tomorrow. I think these documents have the people you talk to listed in them.",

My friend had his appendix burst over a summer course and the professor wouldn\u2019t let him make up any quizzes, only exams because the prof thought it was only a small part of the grade anyway. it was well known that my friend didn\u2019t like him because he would shit talk the professors bad teaching ability during break, and there was no way he didn\u2019t know. When my friends appendix burst I think the prof just wanted him to drop the class and he did, when he should have reported him for not letting him make up quizzes while he was bedridden recovering from surgery. \n\n\nDiscrimination does not have to be based on identity or anything. It\u2019s literally just the teacher treating you unfairly or singling you out.\n\nIt\u2019s this professors fault for making something due on a day where anything past that day will not be accepted due to \u2018school policy\u2019 (which is a lie because I\u2019ve had a lab due on the Sunday after finals week). The grade is due on the 14th. The education system will tell you things and say \u201coh you can\u2019t do that\u201d because they think you\u2019ll just drop it but you can push them if you have reasonable ground. This person received horrible life changing news and probably didn\u2019t even have the time to do the assignment. If the professors decides that they\u2019re gonna be petty you\u2019re gonna have to push.",

I'm not saying that discrimination doesn't exist, but it doesn't seem like this professor is holding them to a different standard than the rest of the class.  And to try and bend the rules so it appears as if they are is lying, which is a type of grade fraud IMO.  While the last day to turn in grades is Wed, once the semester ends, they can turn them in whenever they want to.  And once they're in, they're in.  They can't magically go back and fix things unless they go through a grade change, and the only justification would be if they made a mistake, but the professor did not know about the life changing news until the semester was over.  So no mistake was made, it was just bad luck.\n\nI think your best point is the one you make below, which is a professor should not make an assignment due on the last day of class w/ out giving some time for students to turn it in late (or provide some reason about why they did not turn it in).  In a perfect world, every professor would do this.  But in practice, I'm not sure this is realistic.  Each class is different and some just have major assignments due at the end to ensure students have the time they need.\n\nAnd should every professor wait until the last day to submit there grades in case a student has an emergency? I don't think that's realistic.  Like us, most profs probably just want to start their break as soon as they can, while others probably need the time to grade.  It's not a one size fits all thing.\n\nBut even in this case, it's not like the assignment meant the student failed the class, they just got a B.  And like many people said, it's not likely a B is gonna keep them out of the school they want to go to, unless it's Stanford or something, but that's more Stanford's fault if they can't see a student with one extra B is essentially the same student.  On the other hand, I think trying to commit grade fraud would probably keep them out of the school they want to get into.  And is it really worth the risk?",

    "postText": "Unfortunately, most math students are required to use Aleks to do their homework. Even more unfortunate is that it requires students to use Java in order for it to work. Given the zero-day exploit going around, it may behoove you to install Java 6 on your systems (though it may potentially put you at risk from other exploits). I've been using Aleks with Java 6 and it does technically work though it give you constant pop-ups asking you to install the newest version of Java. If you don't want to go through all that, you can try disabling Java when not doing your homework and then re-enabling it while you're using Aleks. There is an update for Java in October I believe so hang on til then.  \n  \nI wrote to an instructor about this and the response was pretty much, \"Thanks...whatever.\" ",

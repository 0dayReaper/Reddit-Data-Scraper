            "comment": "Yeah, people said it, but to clarify:\n \nThe schedule says the semester starts on Friday because some (few) DVC classes are on Fridays. If you don't have a Friday class, which you probably don't, your semester starts on Monday the 20th. Look at your schedule and just go to your classes at the first meeting time that comes up. So if you're signed up for a class that's Monday/Wednesday 11-12:15, the first time you'll go to that class in Monday, August 20th at 11 am.\n \nAnd hey, good luck, have fun, and hope you get something more than you expected out of your classes. Be sure to post more questions on here when you have them.",

You do not go to all of your classes on day one. only the classes that start on that specific day depending on how you made your schedule.",

    "postText": "Hey I've taken math 193 three time, first time dropped and the next two times with a substandard grade. To repeat the course I have to have an extenuating circumstance that afflicted me during the last semester I took the course. My reasons for not passing the class have to do with stress related but the last time I took the course I got a substandard grade and it was during the summer of 2014, my father was also recently laid off during the same summer and this put a great deal of stress on me. Not only this but my Aunt was battling cancer the whole of last year and passed away late last fall. These two caused me to have terrible stress and prevented me from being able to study effectively for the class. Would these events benefit my case enough to allow me to have a repeat? Thanks for any help in advance.",

And keep showing up so that you can get late add to the class (professor used to give you a late add code that you can use in insite portal, but now, professor manually adds you). This allows you to take class and take other people's spot if they decide to drop, which will happen most of the time.",

Then among who were most present, professor will go in waitlist order. Rarely, professor thinks that is unfair and do it completely random.",

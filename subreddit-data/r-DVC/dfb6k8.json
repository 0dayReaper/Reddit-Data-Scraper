I got one saying the following..\n\n&gt; PG&amp;E has notified Contra Costa County (County) for a possible power shutoff event due to gusty winds and dry conditions that will affect parts of the County. Current projections indicate none of our District locations will be affected. All locations are open and classes are in session.",

    "postText": "I was thinking of taking math 292 and physics 130 over the summer, but I won\u2019t be able to register until I can send my prerequisites, probably early May. Do you guys know if these classes tend to fill up quickly over the summer? Also, just to make sure, I wouldn\u2019t be able to register for the classes without the prerequisites right? Sorry if this is a stupid question, I\u2019ve just been worried about it. Thanks!",

            "comment": "I think as long as you have the prereq in progress you should be able to register. But I kind of advise against taking both over summer unless you can do one in the 3 week and one in the 6 week. All of the math courses I\u2019ve taken over the summer have required at least 5 hours a day and physics 130 is a big filter class. If you can take it with Hamida over the summer do it but ya it is really difficult.",

I was hoping to take the classes over the summer to get some core classes out of the way and save some money. I was looking at the summer schedule and saw that physics starts a few weeks before math, but I\u2019d still have to do both at the same time for a few weeks. Do you think doing both would be doable? If I can get the classes physics would be with Hamida and math would probably be with Rinker or Raymond. Haha sorry for so many questions, I\u2019ve been debating what I should do for a while.",

Hamida is an excellent teacher but his curriculum is tough. I would email admissions and records directly to ask them these questions. I would do it ASAP, but be prepared not to hear back until at least next Monday when spring break ends.",

Be sure to complete the requirements to get your priority registration (if you haven't already)\nUnfortunately, DVC can't take prerequisites in progress at another college/university even if you provide proof that you will pass the class or a syllabus regarding the content material. I helped someone with this and admission &amp; records let us know about this.",

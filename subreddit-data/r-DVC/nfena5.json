It seems enticing but I would have to retake precalc which might be necessary since I don\u2019t remember much stuff from that class. Has anyone had experience with this program or anything related to it?",

I imagine they can provide a lot of support for students who are taking the courses. I would message the Principal investigator, Ellen  Beaulieu for more information about it: lbeaulieu@dvc.edu\n\n They do appear to provide students with a scholarship up to $4,300 annually who maintain the eligibility. So that is a bonus for it!",

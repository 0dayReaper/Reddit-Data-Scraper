You'll pretty much spend all of your summer days with your nose in a book or on a laptop and any procrastination will seriously bite you in the ass. You'll be writing basically all day if you're not reading. \n\nUsually, classwork is posted on canvas every week and assignments aren't really consistent. Some professors send out the syllabus for their summer class earlier through email (gives you a chance to look at the expected coursework).\n\nWould I recommend it? Hell nah. If you're looking for A's, I would probably focus on 3 classes instead of 5. 5 is just overkill.",

            "comment": "General rule of thumb is for \"1 hour in class, you spend 3hrs studying\" given that they are asynchronous these rules may not apply. Consider taking non-major classes as a P/NP at DVC.\n\nYes, there is no meet time given that it is asynchronous.\n\nYou should get access to classes soon for canvas if you haven't gotten it already as some classes are starting as early as next week.\n\nMost students only take about a total of 3 classes per summer and even that may be pushing it. It just depends on the student. I would recommend looking at the syllabus at the beginning of the term and plan out to see if the load is manageable for you. be sure to look at drop-dates as well.",

    "postText": "So I'm aware that when you transfer to UCs, you generally need to take entire course sequences (like Calc 1-2-3) at one community college instead of splitting the courses throughout multiple community colleges (such as taking Calc 1 and college A and Calc 2 at college B).\n\nI was wondering if this means that in a course sequence, whether or not you can take some courses in it at the Pleasant Hill campus and others at San Ramon campus. I know it's technically one college even though it has 2 campuses, but one of the people at the registration event today told me that you can't split a sequence between them either. Any information would be appreciated (need to select classes soon and counselors aren't in easy access for me right now lol).",

I'd highly advise taking your courses at SR, in terms of difficulty the professors are about the same, but the quality of the courses is far superior to the ones at phill. I would recommend prioritizing the Quality of the instructor rather than the convenience of location.",

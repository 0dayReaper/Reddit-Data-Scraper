    "postText": "Heyo DVC. I'm a freshman enrolled in Chem 120 and Biosc 131 for next semester. I was lucky enough to get early enrollment in these classes, so I got spots in each at pretty desirable times.\n\nI realized recently that I could potentially only have school on Tuesdays and Thursdays though, which would make it far easier for me to work in addition to school. \n\nBasically, there's a slot for Chem at 7:55-12:35 and for Bio at 5:30-10:10. There's 5 people on each waitlist and I can't sign up for the waitlist unless I drop the Chem and Bio classes I already registered for. Is it worth the risk? Would I even have a decent chance of getting in?\n\nThanks for your time! Happy holidays :)",

Those classes in particular are very competitive to get into and limited in space because of the lab component so being on the wait list in any spot reduces your chances of getting in by a lot. Also I don't know how you'd handle it but having two classes with lab on the same day would be a drag.",

Happy holidays!",

I'm not registered for English yet, but there is an English class I want with 5 people on the waitlist. I still can't waitlist for it because I think the waitlist maxes out at 5 people and doesn't accept more until someone drops it.",

Some waitlists are &gt;5 people though.\n\nI tested it out just now by trying to waitlist into an English class with 3 Waitlisted students even though I'm already enrolled in the English class. \n\nThe message that popped up indicated that you can't put yourself on the waitlist of a section if you're already enrolled in (or have completed) the class itself. I guess it makes sense, and prevents people from just spamming waitlists, but still :(",

Sometimes a lot of people don't show up to the first day of class and they get dropped right there so you can also add that day.\n\nAlso yes, you are unable to sign up for or waitlist the same class multiple times in a semester.",

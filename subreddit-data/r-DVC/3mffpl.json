    "postText": "Hello! I would love to make friends with some people from DVC. I'm 27, so I'm a little older than most the people I see on campus, but here are some interests of mine. Maybe we match up:\n\nWorld of Warcraft / Blizzard in general\nLord of the Rings (though oh boy do I have a lot of opinions about the movies. And don't get me started on the Hobbit)\nHarry Potter\nDungeons and Dragons (3.0 / 3.5 if possible. I don't care for 4.0 and didn't try anything after that.)\nMagic the Gathering\nMarvel Comics (X-Men and Iron Man are my favorites.)\nDeadwood\nTattoos\nAnimated stuff (not so much anime, sorry, though I do enjoy some like Ghibli, Trigun, Cowboy Beebop, Outlaw Star)\nStand up comedy (Patton Oswalt, Mitch Hedberg, Josh Blue, Jim Gaffigan)\n\nThis is long enough at this point. Hopefully someone is interested. PM me and I'll happily exchange numbers. I'm on campus Monday through Thursday.",

But, you are going to placed slightly lower priority in terms of registration, and you might need principle's signature for taking class(unsure, but I heard few people were requested).",

            "comment": "You're asking two different questions:  \n**1.) Can high schoolers take classes at DVC?** The answer is yes, and HS students only pay $1 to take classes. You can take anything you have cleared pre-req's for, and the only limitation is 10th grade and below are limited to 2 classes or 7 units.  \n\n**2.) Can I get credit for AP exams?** Yes. You can only clear up to 12 units TOTAL with AP or other methods, BUT THERE ARE IMPLICATIONS WHEN IT COMES TIME TO TRANSFER! Check with a counselor first before you go this route, since not all universities are cool with credit by exam for incoming students.",

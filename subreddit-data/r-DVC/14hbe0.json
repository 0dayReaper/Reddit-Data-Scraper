    "postText": "So, I took Counseling 095 last week. I was supposed to get the \nDecember 12th registration date, but I didn't.  Today I went into the Admissions and Records office to get it sorted out. They gave me the registration date for new non-matriculated students, which is January 3, 2012, and told me to go to the counseling center to get them to change it to December 12th.  I went in, told them, and they said it they'll work on it, and call me. (they still have not called me) When I got home, I looked to see if they did in fact add January 3, 2013 as my registration date.  \n\n\nThey didn't, they added January 3, 2012.\n\nI got to register for my classes before the new matriculated students.\n\n\nTL;DR\nAdmissions and Records gave me January 3, 2012 as a registration date for the spring, instead of January 3, 2013.

    "postText": " Hi, I'm taking my community college classes in South Korea. The class started at 3 in the morning and I couldn't manage to attend the class. I'm worried I might get lower than A in the course which isn't essential since I can retake it later and the course is not a prerequisite for any other courses. But my concern is whether the fact that I've dropped the course will appear on the transcript or the UC might be able to know if I dropped the course. If I drop a class before the \"Last day to drop a full-term without a \u201cW\u201d appearing on transcript \\*\\*\", would the class not appear on the transcript?",

It might show up on your unofficial because DVC sucks at updating their systems, but if you were to drop the class today and then send your official transcript tomorrow to an institution, rest assured the receiving institution will NOT see 1) that you attempted the class and 2) will NOT see any \u201cW\u201d on your transcript.\n\nAlso awesome username haha!",

DVC is a government entity after all- and they move both slowly and only when they absolutely have to- so don\u2019t worry if you look up your unofficial transcript/Canvas page and you still see the class there. Just as long as you\u2019re sure you dropped it before the last day to drop with a W date, the UCs will never know about it.",

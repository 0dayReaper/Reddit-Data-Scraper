Definitely, DVC majorly deals with C++ so you'll have to do self-learning of C++ syntax. Do you know enough about dynamic memory management, heap memory, pointer, recursion, object-oriented programming?",

They will do some analogy to C++ but if you have experience with java and Python I think you are gonna be okay. Comsc 210, they do not go over with C++ basic syntax at all. As I remember, they dive directly toward a few classes and structs, then data structure material starts right away. I think this is fair since Comsc 110 and 165 already dealt with C++ and there is no need to go over C++ basic syntax again. Moreover, I highly recommend taking comsc 200 before comsc 210 since you will need to handle lots of header files and object-oriented programming.",

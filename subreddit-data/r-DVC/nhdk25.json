    "postText": "I don't know how often you guys check your school email but I noticed that DVC is now offering students free services through TimelyMD. Personally, I'm kind of in a hole, trying to figure out how to get counseling for my mental health (long story with my insurance) so this could be a resource for anyone who needs it. I almost missed the email (and I'm sure some unsubscribe from them too) myself but sign up was easy and I'm looking to try it out next week.\n\nJust putting this out there in case anyone needs some extra help and good luck on finishing up finals guys! Mine is in 2 hours! \n\nIf you need the site and sign-up instructions, I can add them to this post if needed.\n\nEDIT:\n\n**A guide on how to access the site:**\n\n- Visit this link: [TimelyMD](https://timely.md/faq/ca-students-care/)\n\n- Click the \"Sign In\" button at the top.\n\n- Sign up using your FIRST AND LAST NAME as they appear on your student ID, your DATE OF BIRTH and your .edu SCHOOL EMAIL ADDRESS to verify account eligibility.\n\n- Create your password.\n\n- Agree to Terms and Conditions.\n\n- Click the \"Sign Up\" button.",

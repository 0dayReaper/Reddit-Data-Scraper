    "postText": "I'm trying to transfer in two years and I have to take four classes over the summer. Engl-122, Socio-120, an easy music class, and trig. I'm anxious I'll stress because I know that's the max amount of classes I can take. I was just wondering if to other people how many classes they usually take.",

            "comment": "Usually people take 1 or maybe 2 courses. 12 seems like 4 classes. It will be stressful, but some people can do it so I don't doubt you, but I personally don't suggest this because there are more things that you can do over summer.\n  \nWriting essays, volunteering or doing internship can really help transfer so I recommend doing these and take another semester or two. But for some people transferring early is the only option or is highest priority, so it comes down to your choice. If you do have those opportunities and you can affort extra semester, I suggest doing so.",

I would say it is not \"required\", but I have seen many people who transfer has some ec. Having unique ec helps you to write essays as well. I strongly recommend ec, and if you don't have opportunity, put at least volunteer or club activities on applications.",

Socio and music you can probably just show up and pass. Trig is work, if you are strong with math and going to go up through Calc it shouldn\u2019t be a problem BUT you are going to need those identities on lock for later math classes. Doing proofs and stuff. \n\nIt\u2019s doable but it\u2019s all you are gonna do this summer.",

I took Calc 1 over a summer and I failed and I was an engineering major(I blew my back out in the gym and either couldn\u2019t stay seated or was doped up on pills though). Summer math isn\u2019t easy, it\u2019s an intense 4 hours every day I think. Moves quick. \n\nI have no idea why you would need trig for psych, there will be zero application in that major. That\u2019s nuts. You sure stats won\u2019t work?",

    "postText": "I'm gonna be spending the next 2 years going to DVC.  Trying to transfer to a UC school.  It seems kinda challenging to make friends in a community college environment because everyone commutes.\n\nBefore this I went to a college out of state and I have a decent amount of friends there but it's 2,000 miles away so I'm kinda stuck.\n\nIf anyone wants to play smash bros, make music, longboard (I had an ankle surgery recently so I luge on my deck, haha, plus I'm gonna start volunteering at races which are fun to go to even if you don't participate), try to crash events at UC Berkeley / Saint Mary's, do cool science-y things (I have a membership at the Cal Academy &amp; UC Botanical Garden, and I try to go to the free telescope viewings at Chabot in Berkeley), volunteer, gripe about people who don't take their classes seriously, watch a movie, or whatever else, hmu.  Open to trying new hobbies too.\n\nAlso gonna try to join some clubs to see if I can meet people that way so if anyone has any suggestions on that please lemme know.\n\nI'm more focused on getting back to a 4 year school than I am on trying to really live it up while I'm here but at the same time I don't wanna be miserable.\n\nAlso gonna be trying to make friends more organically but figured it wouldn't hurt to throw up a post online as well.\n\nThanks for reading &amp; good luck this upcoming fall.\n\nRemember it's only four semesters! haha.  You just gotta do well four times in a row.  That's totally doable.\n\nJust make sure to take it seriously.",

Chem club is pretty much the de facto physical science club BTW, we have a lot of pre med and bio science majors along with some randoms.  Welcome to the area and school! What's your major?",

Signed up for generic classes this fall aligned with my interests (calc, French, physics, marine bio), haven't met with a counselor yet to get the ball rolling on course planning.  I signed up for classes before deciding to commit to going to school out here more than just this fall.\n\nI need to get that course planning going though and will sometime this week (ideally I'll meet in person with an academic counselor or at minimum shoot out an email).\n\nAre you currently active in the chem club in a capacity beyond membership (i.e. are you involved in running the club)?  Is there someone I should contact if I would like to join or get more information?\n\n\n",

I recommend either dennis franco or yvonne canada as counselors they are great and really know their stuff, some counselors aren't that great and kind of phone it in.\n\nI am indeed an officer for the chem club. Membership is free and open to everyone all you need to do is show up. There is a Facebook page called dvc chem club 2013-14 or something like that. I will link tomorrow since I am in bed. Perhaps you can show me how to play smash bros.",

I\u2019ve been at DVC for a roughly 8 years with some gaps here and there, but my counselor told me that after finishing one class in the spring, I can transfer! I\u2019m excited but I\u2019m also scared af because I don\u2019t feel mentally ready for it. Idk. Anyone else experience this?",

Generally speaking, when you start to do your junior and senior stuff after transferring, the people who are in your major specific classes will likely be with you for the next year or two, so get to know some of them better. Typically speaking, those in the same major might have the same kind of hobbies.",

I\u2019m also not really big on socializing so I\u2019m gonna have a hard time with club related stuff, especially if it\u2019s online :(",

I am ready to move on and tired of community college. Lol. Wanting to move on is bigger to me than the anxiety I have about going to a completely new school. I might be more scared the closer fall 2021 gets though. Lol",

I was in the same boat, when I transferred, I was wondering if I was mentally prepared for it, but it turned out to be one of the best experiences that I had. Look into reaching out ahead to the university to social groups and just build community.  In terms of the academic side of things, just depends on your major, I know folks who majored in STEM and had some challenges adjusting at first because of the new environment but found their footing later. You just got to make sure you got some time management (especially if you are transferring to a quarter system) and networking skills to help you along there.\n\nAlso, be sure to tap into campus resources. most universities are saying they are going back in person, so that will be a great chance to connect and network as well.",

I'm going into English/linguistics and I have no real background in because I completed ECE prereqs.... I just overall feel dumb about transferring :(",

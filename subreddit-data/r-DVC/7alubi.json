    "postText": "Hello DVC redditors,\n\nI am planning to move to the bay area in January 2018 and continue my engineering undergraduate work at DVC. I have a question for any of you who have registered for classes here before.\n\nIf I can't register for Calc II until early January, is it likely that there will be openings in ANY Calc II classes at either one of the DVC campuses?\n\nI am not allowed to register for Calc II or Physics I until I have a grade for Calc I from my current school, which potentially won't be until mid-December this year. Practically everyone else will have had a chance to register for classes by this time. I really want to continue my Calculus sequence without having to take a whole semester off from these classes.\n\ntl;dr Does anybody have experience with registering for classes (especially Calc II) late and know whether there are usually classes with open space?",

You may get lucky, occasionally classes open up late or there will be a spot left in a unfavorable teachers class.\n\n\nAlso... There is one more way but it may not work if there is a wait list and it is a bit... unmoral. Have someone else already registered at dvc 'save' you a spot by enrolling in the class you want, then have them drop it and you enroll. \n\n\nSource: Dvc graduate who knows the ins and outs \n\n\nGood luck! \n",

Hopefully it doesn't take too long to get the add. It would suck to go to 3 different Physics classes every day for more than a week lol.",

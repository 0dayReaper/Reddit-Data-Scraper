    "postText": "I'm in high school and I'm trying to register for PHYS-130 and MATH-193. Both classes have prereqs, PHYS-130 requires a high school physics course which I have taken and MATH-193 require Calc I or AP Calculus AB in my case. I'm currently in AP Calculus AB so would that mean I have to wait till the school year ends until I can register? Also what can I do for Physics? Email a counselor?",

You can find them via subreddits, searches, and asking around.\n\nFor example, yesterday I was at a downhill skateboarding race, and last week I hosted some people for a super smash bros get together, which were both facilitated via people I've met through meet-up groups.  I'm also in the SF Bay Area group for the 'gaybros' subreddit as of earlier today.  So right there I have three different circles within which I can start to get to know people.  \n\nTo get to know someone well takes time; trying to force it ironically dooms you to not achieve the desired outcome.  Just let it happen organically.\n\nSlow and steady wins the race.\n\nedit: if you play an instrument, look into the music program.  if you have a scientific interest, look into / ask around about volunteering\n\nalso, and this may sound a bit weird, but dressing in a way that communicates your interests would be really useful if you can afford to buy some new clothes.  it's a non verbal way of identifying yourself to others who might be able to connect with you.  when I see people wearing a shirt with a band I like or something similar, I'll often approach them and go 'hey man you like ___ ?' &amp; sometimes it can lead to a solid conversation\n\nhope this helps",

    "postText": "I couldn\u2019t get an appointment with a counselor so I figured I would ask here. Can you apply to graduate if you plan to finish your credits during the summer term? I will be taking 2 classes. Will they have an application for summer term or would I have to wait till fall term graduation to be able to apply. Also, is applying for graduation necessary if I am transferring to a university?",

            "comment": "In relation to applying to earn your degree/certificate, that can be done every semester. For summer, that due date is generally mid-July but apply for it right at the beginning of the summer term via InSite. You generally apply for your degree in the semester that you are completing your last classes for your program. Keep in mind this relates specifically to earning an AA/AS/AA-T/AS-T/Certificate program at DVC. Applying for graduation is not necessary to transfer.\n\nWhen you mention, you are planning to finish credits over the summer, are you referring to completing one of the degrees mentioned above or with relation to transfer (i.e. program prereqs, units to meet 60 units for transfer, etc.)?",

If it's Lipson, we'll bump into each other.\n\nIt heavily depends on the material the professor chooses, and Lipson is already hard during fall/spring, so summer is going to be even harder. Time management is your best friend.\n\nI suggest reviewing CHEM-120 concepts beforehand, because once summer starts, it's just going to be a rapid fire of information for us both.",

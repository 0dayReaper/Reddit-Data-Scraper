There are 5 others also waitlisted and I'm the rank 1 on the waitlist, does anyone knows what should I do if i don't get in the class before the fall classes start, talk to the professor? just show up to the class? The professor is   \nAchilles Speliotopoulos. Thanks in advance!\n\nEdit: someone dropped the class and I got in! Thanks everyone for the advice",

(note, he also teaches the same physics course at UC Berkley, back when I took him, he actively compared the grades of the UC students to the Class to give a general picture on how close you are to UC students as a whole)\n\nAs for wait list goes, attend all the classes. Every professor usually has their own method for filling the possible empty class seats. If someone drops, some professors will go down the wait list order, others will do random lottery.",

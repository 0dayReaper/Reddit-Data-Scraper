Sometimes teachers will do raffle(alternative way of fairness based on equal opportunity). Some might favor individuals who are very close to transfer(to get them out quickly). Some teachers may also oversign students to a class and take on more than alloted.",

            "comment": "As students begin to drop from the class, the system will send an email to the next student on the waitlist that they have the ability to register. Generally, they have about 24-48hrs to sign up for the class. All emails should go to the DVC email, so it's important that you are checking that. \n\nIf your class in the fall, I would stay on the waitlist for it as students don't tend to drop off until closer to the start of the semester.",

Social science class wise, some courses in psychology like social psychology are good. Just depends on what you major is to help to balance out your schedule",

And if you take it during that time, take it as P/NP. Saves you a headache with the class. \n\nDepending on where you look to transfer in the future FTVE 210 is great for clearing some diversity requirements at some universities.\n\nFor music, you can't go wrong with professor Vasallo.",

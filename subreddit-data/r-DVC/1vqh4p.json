    "postText": "So my chem class goes until 10pm on TTH, and during the basic intro stuff my professor mentioned that it shouldn't be too dangerous at night as long we followed the stream of people walking to their cars/etc. However, I have never experienced any danger or felt that I was in any danger. How often are crimes committed on campus at night? And should I be concerned for my general well-being after class? ",

Even though I was parked all the way out at the overflow lot, nothing happened to my car the whole semester. I don't know so much about attacks on students, but vehicles seem ok.",

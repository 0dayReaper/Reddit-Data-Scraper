    "postText": "Hi! So I signed up to be a new student in San Ramon! I did the dvc mmap thing for assessments and got a confirmation that I don\u2019t need to take the assessment. I emailed my unofficial transcript that has all the quarters (except this quarter since school ends in 3 days) to their given email. However they haven\u2019t emailed me back in a long time. What can I do? I need to register for couns 95!!! And who should I contact? ",

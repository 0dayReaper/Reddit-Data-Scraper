    "postText": "So basically I haven't taken math in like 3 years and didn't know anything but like 3 of the questions on the assessment test so I just guessed on all the rest, and when I got the results it said I got placed in things like Trig. Do I have to take these classes or can I start with Algebra 2 regardless of my assessment? Would it be worth it to just try to do Trig since I got lucky with the placement? I'm a little bit worried cuz I don't have any idea what I'm doing math wise and don't feel prepared for these classes at all. Thank you in advance!  ",

Math-120, Intermediate Algebra is the name for algebra 2 at DVC, and Trig I believe is math-121. \n\nIf you're unsure about which class you should take, speak to a counselor! If you're a first time college student this may mean registering for  Counseling 095. \n\nDVC also has free math tutoring too, so that's something you should definitely look into. More info on tutoring is on the website. Math tutoring takes place in the Math Lab within the Learning Center.",

If you need to do c95, submit another application to DVC, just make sure it's for Summer 2018 this time.\n\nThis isn't going to change anything you've already done, or affect anything you've already completed like assessments.\n\nOver the weekend, make sure you have completed your online orientation, and of you haven't already done your English assessment, make an appointment for one asap next week. If you have done both English and math assessments, and your orientation, go to the enrollment lab. Someone can help you register for c95 there. \n\nC95 is your first meeting with a counselor. That'll be when they'll help you pick out which classes you need for whatever major you're aiming for. Once you know all that, you can register for your fall classes. \n\nMy advice is to get moving on this sooner than later. Longer you leave it, less spaces in the classes you want",

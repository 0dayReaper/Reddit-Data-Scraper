            "comment": "Early Saturday morning, a plastic trash can next to the box office (small building as you walk up the main staircase where you buy play tickets) was burning. Firefighters that responded say that the fire had been burning for some time. I think someone probably threw a cigarette butt into the bin that wasn't fully extinguished. The funny thing is that they sent **5 firetrucks** to respond to it. Also, Campus Police Services was totally unreachable during this whole ordeal, even when Contra Costa Fire tried to call them, and there was a music festival starting a half hour away which was attended by multiple visiting Middle and High schools.

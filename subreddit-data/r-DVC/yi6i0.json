    "postText": " Though some of you (with Friday classes) may have already started. Also, a reminder that with the reduction of so many classes the administration is going to be especially strict on instructors to drop students who do not show up to the first day of class. **Go to your first day of class.** If you need to add classes, you have a much better chance of getting in if you contacted the instructor in advance AND you also show up to at least the first week of classes. **It's imperative that you don't fuck off your first week of classes for all students.** DVC serves about the equivalent to the population of a small city, so in order to accommodate as many people as possible they will have no qualms dropping you if you don't show up to class.  \n\nGo Vikings!",

    "postText": "I'm going to take the online programming class over the summer, even though I would prefer an in-class one. Anyone here who has taken a CS course at DVC, did you use any study groups or other resources to help you? I'm afraid that the material will be too stale and/or hard to understand if it's presented mostly online. ",

            "comment": "which CS class are you taking. Albeit its nice to take C++ classes in person, but its not that bad to learn online. In fact, if you are trying to become a CS major, its all of the other languages you learn outside of class that kind of gives you a head start vs other CS students who are looking for a job as well. In general, all the CS classes are technically hybrid classes as the lecture notes and stuff are always online, and all your work is generally done online and on a computer besides midterms. Though yeah, you have the right idea to make study groups if you aren't getting a concept because CS is a lot about concepts (at least your first programming language is, for additional languages, its mostly syntax)",

I understand that since the field revolves around computers, most of the learning is going to be online and solitary, but I guess my main concern is around motivation. Did you find it hard to learn languages on your own, or does it get interesting enough to keep you going? Or do CS courses include collaboration?",

As a heads up, it says C++  and/or java, but they will most likely not teach you java, its just that Java syntax is also included in the Burn's Intro to C++ manual(really helpful actually for coding, color cordinated and pretty organized and concise).\n\n\n Not a CS major(Comp Engineering Major) but I have taken 110, 165 and 210 already. There is no collaboration work for the 110 class, but you are 100% free to discuss the content with other students. Depending on your teacher, you will also have a class discussion group(Ive taken Chern, Pencheva and Burns, I know that Pencheva will have a discussion group, and Burns 100% has a Google hangouts discussion group(IMO hes the best programming teacher))",

(Took it with Pentcheva)  I only showed up 5 times the entire semester, did half the html assignments, passed all the tests With the help of google, and did the final project in 10 minutes.  Got a B, probably would haven gotten an A had I done 1 or 2 more programming homeworks, but oh well.",

If you already know how to navigate a computer and use Office, then 100 will be so boring you will end up dropping it. 110 at least offers some mental exercise. Do yourself another favor and take Burns, because he is **the** best CS teacher at DVC. Also, when you get stuck (you will), come see *me* in the computer lab for CS tutoring. :)",

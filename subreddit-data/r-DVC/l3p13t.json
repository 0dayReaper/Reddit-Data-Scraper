It can be confusing for those who have no programming experiences as it is quite different from other classes, but I believe it can be learned.\n\n  \n\nIf you meant like teaching styles and gradings, it can be little annoying because many professors force you to practice certain programming habits. I would say it is helpful in the long terms, so if you can not be bothered by it too much, then it should be fine. What exactly are you looking for? Course experience? Specific instructor's teaching styles?",

Pay attention to pointers and passing by value/reference, they are critical to everything else you'll do in c++.",

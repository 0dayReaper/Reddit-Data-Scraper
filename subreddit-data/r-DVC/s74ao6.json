    "postText": "Neither of these courses are showing up on DVC's schedule. Does no one teach them? Also, for PHYSICS-230, is there only one online course? I would like to take 230 as well since I took 130 last semester, but because of my school classes, I can't during the online session since it's in the morning.\n\nIf not, does anyone know where I can take a PHYSICS-230 and COMPSC-240 equivalent class outside of DVC?",

May I ask what is reason for you to take those courses?\n  \nMost people take cs 110, 165, 210 and 260, which are all taught in c++. UC requires these courses and most colleges accept courses taught in C++. Those courses you mentioned are in python and java which are not very popular because UC doesn't accept them. (I see that csu accept them but I'm sure they accept C++ courses as well.)",

They, they department, have meetings every semester to decide courses for the semester so explaining your situation can let them know online courses are necessary for some people and make on for next semester.",

    "postText": "Hey guys,\nSo I got a C in calc 2 for fall semester. I want to retake it next semester to get an A but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be allowed. Does DVC allow people to retake a class if they have a C or is it only for D\u2019s and F\u2019s? Also, if I can retake will UCs take into account the higher grade I got for calc 2?",

Most the information in the above link applies options for you to consider after receiving a non passing grade.",

Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t say in the course catalog anything about retaking calc 2 with a C, so I don\u2019t think I can. Im just worried about my GPA because it will be hard to raise it back up.\nAnyways,thanks again!",

                            "comment": "So I'm pretty sure Calc 2 isn't a repeatable course.  I am reasonably certain that there are codes in the catalog that refer to whether or not a course is repeatable - from what I remember the vast majority of classes aren't repeatable, especially with the passing grade. It may be tricky to locate the info in the catalog by the way, but if you have one (or view it online) you could probably hunt down the info.\n\nIf you can wait for clarification check with Admissions and Records, or swing by the Enrollment Lab and see if they're able to show you how to see if a class is repeatable. You can also check with counseling too!",

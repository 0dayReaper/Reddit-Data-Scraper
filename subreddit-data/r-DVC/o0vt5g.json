    "postText": "Hey guys, I was wondering if anyone who has transferred to UT Austin from DVC was willing to share their experience and advice? Or if anyone who is planning on transferring there want to connect with? My main question is what classes did you take at DVC to fulfill transfer requirements from a California Community College to a University in Texas? And were those classes able to clear prerequisites? I believe the compsci sequence must be taken again at University once you get in right? That's part of the reason the transfer admissions says you can expect to complete your degree in 3 years regardless of the number of classes\n\nRight now I am in my second year at DVC. I have completed IGETC. Perhaps some of those general ed requirements will transfer over hopefully. I have already taken calc 1 and 2, intro and adv C++, intro to physics, and discrete math. And I have yet to take calc 3, linear algebra, physics 1 and 2, data structures, object oriented, and assembly language. ",

According to the website, last year, 2 people went there, but don't be disheartened; you could be a first!\n\nAll the best :)",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, \nFirst off I just want to said that I\u2019m tend to overthink everything and just make everything hard for myself but I though writing things will help and hope some of you will be able to give advice to lesser the stress and overthinking a bit. \n\n1. I\u2019m currently being waitlist in physics 129 with Dr.Colwell (rank 4) which is leading me think that I won\u2019t be able to get in the class and I\u2019m scared of this because I need this class in order to take physics 130, which is one of my preparation class for my major. I\u2019m trying to transferring next fall to a 4 years uni. \n2. My gpa is going downhill. Not going to lie, I did really well in Calc l and got a solid B throughout the semester but after final, it went down to a C. Terrible, I know right. But I\u2019m planning to forget this C and move on to Calc ll (I\u2019ll go over the Calc l in the summer ) and hope to be a better student to get an A to show that I putting more efforts than I\u2019ve when taking Calc l. But my gpa will never recover because of that C. I did try asking my prof to drop the grade to a D so I can retake the class but he said no, well sort of but idk anymore. \n3. I guess Im having imposter syndrome, Idek if im using the term correctly but after finding out about my C in Calc l, I feel like I wouldn\u2019t be able to get in my college because 1. My major is hella impacted and 2. This college look at your gpa instead of your extracurricular. Like it\u2019s messed up that they would rather look for good students than passive students. Urgggggg. So now im feel like im not good enough for them because my gpa is only 3.6. \n4. Nowadays, I feel like I regret choosing to go to a CC over 4 years because the stress of reapply to college and having to currently keep your gpa up is just too much for me. Now, I feel like I made a huge mistakes but can\u2019t fix it because I can\u2019t go back to the past and fix my decision. Im just so lost and idk if I would ever recover from this feeling of lost and regret. \n \nAnyway, I\u2019m a first Gen so I really don\u2019t have anyone to talk to about this kind of problems so if you have tips to cope with this kind of thought, pls help me out. Oh did I ever mention that these thoughts occurs this week? Yeah all if these unfortunate events/thoughts occur in one week and omg ngl this costs me more stress and overthinking than finals ever did.",

He didn\u2019t when I was in the class but it was an online class during covid so idk.\n2.\tI had an C my first semester in physics 130 and I just said on my college app that I wasn\u2019t prepared for rigorous college courses and I still got in to the college I wanted.\n3.\t 3.6 is still a good gpa and don\u2019t fell bad about it.\n\nWell all I any to say don\u2019t try to overthink stuff, easier said than done i know but keep pushing through and you\u2019ll get though it. Hope this helps.",

You may send an email to ask the Professor abt the chance of getting accepted. \n2. GPA isn\u2019t the only thing that define who you are and show your potentials. And colleges know about that. I\u2019ve seen students got into Cal/UCLA w 3.5 or even lower. Getting a C grade isn\u2019t the end of the world. In the newest UCLA transfer guide, one of the considering factors is \u201cacademic improvement.\u201d I\u2019ve heard some students got C,D,F in the beginning, but then they worked hard and maintained good GPA, eventually got into Cal/UCLA. Beyond GPA, colleges wanna see your growth and how you strive to overcome the obstacles.\n\nI also made a mistake which got me fired recently. I felt regret and lost like you because I love that job. I stayed on my bed for several days, did nth and just cried all day. But it didn\u2019t help w anything. I realised that whatever happened, happened. There\u2019s no going back. The best thing I shld do is not looking back and moving on. It\u2019s absolutely normal to have all these negative thoughts. But don\u2019t let them devastate you. Take a brief break and spend some quality times w your loved ones. Forget abt the past and give yourself an opportunity to start over again. \ud83e\udd1d\ud83d\udcaa",

Ask and you shall receive.  \n\n2. Definitely redeem yourself by studying for the higher-level math courses \u2014 an upward trend looks good on your application.  \n\n3. Try to be realistic with GPA in relation to your application major, but don\u2019t let reality stop you from your dreams. If your applications has essays, definitely go for it as that\u2019s more holistic.  \n\n4. The grass is greener where you water it. Don\u2019t have regrets as CC is a great option both academically and financially.  \nMost importantly, try to assert yourself in the present moment. It\u2019s not good to get stuck in the past, just keep pushing!",

            "comment": "Have you not taken any physics in high school? Even if it was outside of US, you might be qualified to enroll in 130, skipping prior course. Honestly, you could explain your situation and ask your professor if they can \"test\" on some basic stuff to enroll and save time. (And not worrying about not getting the class)\n  \nAlso, if you stick around you should be able to get late add code and most of the time, you should be able do enroll.\n  \nWhat major are you trying to transfer?",

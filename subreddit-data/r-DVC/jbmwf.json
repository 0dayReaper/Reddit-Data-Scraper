    "postText": "My SO is an instructor at DVC and they are seeing a lot of classes that aren't filling up so the big bosses (you know, the people you never see, don't know their names, but they determine if that class you need to transfer is offered) are trying to cut classes, like, NOW, before the semester starts.  Please don't wait to sign up for classes until the last minute because honestly, the class might not be there.  \n\nThe instructors are fighting (my SO has yelled at a boss-man more than once) to keep these classes but the boss-men are being hard asses.  Shameless plug for SO: the physical science classes aren't all filled and a lot of them just require that you took Algebra in HS as the only pre-req.  Even if you drop the class in 2 weeks, by you signing up keeps it on the books for the other students.  Thanks!",

The Dean of each department pretty much decides on which classes stay and go, and from what I recall 15 registered students is the magic minimum for a class.  I've actually had a class that the Dean himself was teaching who had to cancel his own class the first week due to lack of enrollment. ",

And that's not for the giganto classes, that's for classrooms that hold 35 tops, their critical number is 20. \n\nBut you are right, sometimes those who have to make the cuts are the ones teaching the classes, if they try to play favorites, they get a buttload of people in power up their asses and it can get crowded.\n\nPeople are signing up which is great!  Keep coming!  Trust me, the teachers want to see you, they like helping you learn! (Corny I know, but for most of them, it's what gets them up in the morning!)",

    "postText": "ll. Long time Disney fan here. Just took the plunge and joined DVC. Polynesian is our home resort. I booked our second stay for Saratgoga Springs this October and realized I made it a day too short. I went to add another day and it's unavailable and has been wait listed. Can anyone offer suggestions on how to fix this?\n\nAlso, any advice on getting Boardwalk? I've had a wait list for months now. Realize it's tough during food and wine but would appreciate hearing any strategies.\n\nThanks",

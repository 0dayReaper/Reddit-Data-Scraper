But sometimes professors aren't as bad as their ratings make them seem, so I was curious if anyone had any experience taking discrete math with them.",

If you are weak in logic and reasoning, then his claas isnt the class to take as thats more or less what discrete math is. Imo its more programming style logic than it is an actual math class. Hes more or less a super nerdy guy.\n\nThe subject is super easy if you are good at proofs, hard if you arent.",

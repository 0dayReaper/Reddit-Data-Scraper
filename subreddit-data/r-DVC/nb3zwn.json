My major isn\u2019t focused on science so I get free reign on what sciences I can take, any suggestions for easy ones? Was kinda looking at an anthropology class for bio but I\u2019m not sure, any suggestions\u2019ll help!",

Oceanography has been positive.\n\nOn the side of biological sciences, consider BIOSCI-170/171 (Environmental science), but definitely some options in ANTHR-141.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ndepending on your major and where you are transferring to (especially if you are looking at CSU/UCs) consider taking those non-major science classes as P/NP",

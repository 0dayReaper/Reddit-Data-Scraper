Please do not park there unless you have an EV - you WILL be ticketed, regardless of whether or not you have a valid parking permit. Only EVs may park in those spots per state law.",

The spaces are off limits to students until 5pm, so it's mainly the evening folks that are affected by this. The spaces are clearly marked with signs as EV only, yet I have seen a different person there each day - and yes they all were cited. ",

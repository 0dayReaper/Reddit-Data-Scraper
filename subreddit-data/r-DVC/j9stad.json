    "postText": "I need to finish 78 course units until Spring 2022. I was going to apply for DVC this summer but I didn't because I was worried about online classes and I expected classes will be offline next Spring. Now, it seems spring 2021 will be online so I decided to apply anyway whether it's online or offline. My question is can I take more than 19 course limit as a freshman? Also I am planning to take around 22 course units for Spring 2021/Fall 2021/Spring 2022 and 12 course units for Summer 2021. I might use winter session if needed. Will DVC allow me to do this?",

Korea, I used to study for 14 hours a day, 7 days a week for 365 days. \n\nBut the problem is do DVC allow this to freshman? If not, I might have to take more than 25 units for 2021 Fall and 2022 Spring.",

But definitely make a counseling appointment because it looks like you can get some of the requirements waived.",

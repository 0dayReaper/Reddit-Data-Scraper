The class requires a certain amount of time public speaking and i believe it is 15 or 20 minutes total so you do the theory at home and still have to show up for four speeches anyway. I strongly recommend taking that class in person. It is a fun class and the professors understand that not everyone is going to be MLK. Easy A to be honest.",

I think the hybrid courses are the ones where you meet a couple times a month, but some of the speech courses are listed as fully online.",

Go to Fall 2018 and click the search function \"Special Programs\" select \"December Cyber Session\".  Eventually the list of courses offered for winter will be there. Hope this helped!",

We meet once a month or so, but most of our speeches are actually online unlike what someone else wrote, so it depends on the professor. We only have one speech in person as far as I know - at the end of the semester. You can message me if you want more details or have questions.",

I think I found another online course at Contra Costa CC, and the instructor told me there were no campus meetings so hopefully I can enroll in that one. Something I've been wondering about is, what are online speeches like? I've heard that some require gathering an audience. If that's the case, I would rather just take it at my own CC on campus, but I will have a very full schedule.",

Of course it could vary from class to class though, but I doubt professors would expect their students to find an audience every time. That can be hard if you're busy.",

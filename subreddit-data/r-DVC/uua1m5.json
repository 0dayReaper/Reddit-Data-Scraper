            "comment": "There are different registration dates for folks. And yeah a lot of the GE classes fill up quickly. Especially classes like English 122 that everyone has to take. Waitlist if you can show up and try to add to classes you can\u2019t get on the waitlist for if you need the class. \n\nFolks just out of high school are part of the last wave to register if that\u2019s your case.\n\nEdit:\nIf you struggle with ANY kind of mental health issues, go talk to DSS. There are a lot of ways they can help including priority registration. Someone I dated at the time had ADHD and got accommodations like being able to take tests in a different room that was free from distractions.\n\nEdit 2: \nDon\u2019t buy text books until after attending the first meeting of each class. You won\u2019t need them day one and frequently teachers have different versions of the book that can be used besides what is carried at the bookstore. Older editions are normally cheaper. Also textbook buy back pays so little it\u2019s almost a scam. Very rarely they pay a good percentage of a books original price, so rent what you can and try to get used over new. Either from the bookstore itself or places like Amazon and Chegg. Use the isbn number to make sure you have the right edition. Every once in awhile the isbn won\u2019t match, for example a loose leaf book can have a different isbn than a hardback of the same edition.\nSource: Went to dvc for far to long and worked at the bookstore the whole time.",

    "postText": "I had a high A in one of my classes before I took the final. After I took the final, which I studied for harder than I did for the midterm (which I got an A on), the final grade I got in the class (posted on insite) was a C. I would have had to get an F on the final in order for this to happen.\n\nMy teacher doesn't use D2L (so I can't see what I got on the final) and hasn't replied to my e-mail that I sent almost a week ago. I e-mailed DVC support a couple of days ago and have no reply yet; I plan on calling Monday. Two other students who expected A's also got C's.\n\nAnyone have any thoughts or suggestions? One of the C-expecting-A students called and was told to wait until next semester to talk to the professor. I e-mailed support hoping that they would call the teacher and let the professor know that several students are concerned with the grade they received.\n\nAnd for the record, if I failed, fine. But it was an absolute shock that my final grade was a C, and I just want to find out how I got the C.\n\nThanks in advance for replies.",

I believe it takes a bit of work to change the grade, but it is indeed possible.\n\n\nedit: on a side note, is it me or is anyone elses insite not working",

The maintenance message from Friday is still coming up, which says that the message will go away once the maintenance is over. So maybe they're way overdue?",

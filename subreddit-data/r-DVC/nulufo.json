    "postText": "Hey all! I'm an incoming freshman coming right out of high school. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a bit confused about when/how I should register for fall courses. From my understanding, the COUNS-095 course will help me register for classes and create an educational plan? I'm scheduled to take that class/meeting on the 26th, but don't really know what to expect from it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a little afraid that if I wait until the 26th, most fall courses will already be filled up since registration started a while ago. Is that likely? Any guidance for what I should do here would be awesome",

            "comment": "I'm pretty sure that new students are not allowed to register for classes, because couns95 teach you how to register for classes. So, you are not expected to register and even if you do know how to do so, you prob can't do anything for now.\n\nCouns95 is actually pretty useful one day course. Not much work is needed, or expected. You just have to pay some attention and get really useful info there. Here are some of the things they will tell you (which you can ask from other people here in reddit or any DVC people in general if you forget or want to know in advance. Feel free to reach out to anyone including myself)\n\n1. How to use insite portal and register for classes.\n2. How to use canvas (class website for downloading and uploading hw)\n3. What classes to take (to transfer and how to search courses that you might be interested in)\n4. How to transfer\n5. Aaaand maybe some other stuff.\n\nProbably how to register for classes and transfer related ones are the most important. They don't have any specific major related knowledge in depth, so you can ask some people here in reddit for details or sign up for counselor appointment.\n\nP.S. New students are generally expected to not be able to take 'all' the classes that they want to take, but that's totally fine. DVC gives you more priority as you take more semester here, so you won't end up transferring not being able to take some major course. Also, you will need to take some general eds anyways.",

    "postText": "I'm from out of state but have family in the east bay. I'm REALLY unfamiliar with California's college system, so I was wondering if anyone could help me with a few questions?\n\nFirst, I know with the budget cuts to CC's in California it's harder to get classes you need. Does this mean there's like a mad dash to sign up for classes the day registration opens? After my initial flight in February, I won't be in California until June. Any tips for registering?\n\nAlso, I went to a university here for 2 years before leaving. I was pretty much immature, naive, and messed up, but I think I have some transferable credits. Would my entire transcript transfer over including any W's, etc?\n\nAnd one last thing, if I decided to take summer classes, would this hurt my chances for UC or do they only care that you finish your pre-reqs in 2 years or less? I noticed that I'm going to be having to take 5 semesters of math (calc1-3, discrete math and linear algebra), and I think the best route would be to take one of these in the summer?\n\nThanks.",

You said you won't be in California until June but all the registering could be done online? (not sure if that helps). TIPS: Find out the day you register and jump on the computer before the register time and get your classes prepped to be added. It will make it even easier if you have all your section codes ready so you can quickly add your classes. If need be, you could always crash a course! (but that isn't always reliable)\n\n&gt;And one last thing, if I decided to take summer classes, would this hurt my chances for UC or do they only care that you finish your pre-reqs in 2 years or less?

I transferred to UC San Diego with only statistics under my belt and into a major that requires me to go to calc3. (Now I'm in pre-calculus). So just an option for you that you can complete your math at UC if you wanted to. However, if you have your math completed that will make you more appealing to the UCs.",

I have a somewhat alright picture of the classes I'll need from Assist.org, but I've been told not to do IGETC for my major (Computer Science) so I don't have much of an idea outside of the core foundation courses.",

However, for some reason they asked me if I attended any other schools before I went to DVC I'm not sure why, but I know that adds a small obstacle when planning a counseling appointment. You are on the right path with assist.org As far as IGETC goes I believe it really depends on which UC you are applying to. To my knowledge, UC San Diego is the only school in the UC system that requires you to finish the IGETC before you are admitted. ",

            "comment": "As for the budget cuts, Prop. 30 passing pretty much stopped the bleeding as it were, so you don't have to worry about classes getting cut (unless there is low enrollment). However, there are still a significantly fewer amount of classes available compared to even a year ago and as a new, out-of-state student you will have low priority. For a general idea about what units might transfer, check out [ASSIST.](http://www.assist.org/web-assist/welcome.html) If you make a counseling appointment (they will most likely not answer your questions over the phone or email for security/ID theft reasons), they pretty much hand-hold you through this website anyway.  \n\nIf you have previous units, be aware that if you apply for financial aid any and all units attempted will count retroactively against any future aid. The current rules allow for up to 120 units of financial aid, so if you theoretically have attempted 60 units, you could only then another 60 possible units worth of financial aid. Attempted units on your transcript include anything that has a grade listed, including a W. ",

There is always the issue that if a class has low enrollment on the census date (some number of days into the semester, usually first week) it will get cut, but you will get an idea if the class is at risk if you show up day 1 and there are 14 people there.  This semester they didn't restore but a few classes, they are hoping for more in fall.  It won't be a heap, but it will be better.  That said, they can never make promises or guarantees because they never know what may be coming down the pike.  ",

I would suggest not putting off any dreaded classes, as also worrying about even getting into them might make you never want to finish. So far DVC is also keeping the Summer session, but that might change at any time. If they do end up keeping it, it's a great time to catch up on classes as a lot of people leave during the Summer. ",

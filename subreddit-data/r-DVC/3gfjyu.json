Six platforms for Olympic lifts with bumper plates, a good range of dumbells up to about 100 lbs, ez curl bars, straight bars, benches, leg press and other machines, row and lat pulls. The works. The equipment is old but servicable. Never crowded and I really like it.\n\nThe hours can be a hassle though. They close at certain times on certain days so make sure that your schedule fits.\n\nWhat are you looking for exactly?",

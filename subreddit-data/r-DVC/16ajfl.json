Are they much cheaper than the book store?\n\n",

            "comment": "1)Very difficult, during the fist 2-3 weeks due to people fielding classes the parking lot fills up pretty early, I've had semesters where both the standard and overflow lots were full by 11, this may seem ridiculous but if you a lot half an hour or more to finding a space and hiking from your car to class you should have an ok chance but there's no telling with luck.\n\n3)yes but totally not required, about 4 of 30 students will have either a laptop or a tablet to play angry birds on\n\n4)depends on how serious you are about the class but get them of amazon if possible, the profs will generally allow 2 weeks at the most of not having the text\n\nYour prof may have a copy of the text at the DVC library that's available for a limited 2-3 hour rental, In-library use only. If you're ok with doing all your text-based work in the library you may be fortunate enough to just use that all year but it depends majorly on the prof.\n\nA lot of the custom books that DVC prints are workbooks that get written in. They aren't that pricey at the DVC store but you may get lucky and find a blank one at Get Used! Books but there's no telling, start shopping now. \n\nanything else?",

Contributing in class and such.\n\nALSO. Get a student body ID card at the student services building across from the cafeteria, You can load some extra dollars on that for emergency printing on campus in the Library and/or Computer lab.\n",

    "postText": "Has anyone tried to get a learning disability assessment through DSS this year? I emailed in August for one because of my severe (undiagnosed) dyscalculia, but I was denied an assessment due to covid. I can only get accommodations for being deaf, but I seriously need it for dyscalculia. I just emailed again in hopes that they changed it because I now have a 65% in Math 119. I can't go anywhere else for an assessment because I don't drive, can't afford a regular test (it can be $2k), and my insurance doesn't cover much. I'm extremely frustrated with DSS and it feels like they're doing the total opposite of what they should be doing...",

He said they aren't hiring until spring either. \ud83d\ude44 Still an answer, but pisses me off more. I'm having to go to someone that he linked me to, and pay out of pocket for it.",

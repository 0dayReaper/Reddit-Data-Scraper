    "postText": "I am a biochemistry major and I tried joining the chem club but they told me they didn't allow Mongolians to join (I am Mongolian so I found this extremely offensive Even if it was a joke). I asked why and then another member chipped in saying it was actually because \"I am a tranny\". Yes I am F to M but why does it matter? Ive joined other clubs without this happening. This club is extremely immature and I'm pretty sure most of the members are insecure nerd potheads. Anyways is there any way I can file a \n complaint?",

I am a member of Chem club although I have not been active this semester and this is outrageous, this is not in the character of the club at all.\n\nI will go to the club advisors today and make them aware of your complaint. You can contact them your self if you would like. I will send you their emails in a bit as I am in class.",

I would like to make it clear that the Chemistry club does not condone racism or any other kind of discrimination. I believe you ran into a bad person who does not in any way represent the chem club and if the club knew of this behavior they would be ejected.\n\nI realize that it would be uncomfortable for you to confront this person and i don't know how to move forward in light of that. But if you would like to make public your problem i can assure you that you would find the club supportive. \n\nI will pm you the email addresses of the advisers and you can  contact them if you would like.",

I would like to make a formal response to this post. \n       DVC Chemistry Club is the most diverse club on campus, and we have never made any rules or policies that go against race or gender or orientation. In fact, the club's agenda is to get as many people as we can together to enjoy chemistry and science, regardless of their background. All of the activities that we have ever done, such as the outreach programs at middle schools or the magic shows for the foster dream kids, show that there is not such thing as discrimination going on in our club. We are also one of the very few clubs on campus that don't take membership fee. \n      I am not sure that who gave out this misleading information about DVC chemistry club, but I am 100% sure that this person or this group of people is not part of our club. \n      If you are interested in joining Chemistry Club, please come and join us this Friday, October 3rd, from 2pm-3pm @ room PS 275. \n      Thank you very much",

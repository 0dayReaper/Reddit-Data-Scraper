    "postText": "hello, it's my first semester here in DVC and I wish to transfer within 1.5 years which means I will transfer to UC by fall 22. For those who majored comp sci or is majoring comp sci in DVC, is it possible to finish within 1.5 years and transfer to either UCB or UCLA? Or should I slow it down and take 2-2.5 years in DVC? and how many clubs should I join to make my cv look attractive when applying to UC?",

If you are applying for fall 2022 admission, you need all the required courses completed before summer 2022. So courses taken in spring 2022 will count.\n\nIt says so on the [assist.org](https://assist.org) articulation agreement: [https://assist.org/transfer/report/24680781](https://assist.org/transfer/report/24680781)",

Thank you for commenting, this means that dental cleanings may take several appointments to complete depending on the extent of the work (deep cleanings may take more appointments). Since DVC is a teaching clinic, all work is performed by students and checked by their instructor who is a licensed dental hygienist or dentist, these check ins take time and make the appointment longer. After an exam, the student can let the patient know an estimate of how long it might take.",

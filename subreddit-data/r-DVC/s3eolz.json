    "postText": "Hi, I have a D+ for my ENGL122L class because I didn't turn in my essay on the due date. I have DSS accommodations, so when I tried to convince my instructor to grade it, she refused to grade it. Although I was able to manage my time and work on it,  I couldn't complete it because four exams around that time were pummeling me. \n\nAnother thing I noticed was that my English teacher did not know I had accommodations. This led me to become frustrated as the DSS told some of my instructors about my accommodations and didn't bother to tell the rest. I contacted them today about the issue, and they said they'd look into it. I also contacted the head of the grade disputes about the issue, and he told me not to expect any change, which is unfortunate.\n\nI want to say that I regret everything that has led to this moment, and I am somewhat panicking right now. I really need this grade to fulfill the needs for my financial aid (not affiliated with DVC). If things turn out to be not the way I wanted them to be, will the college(s) that I want to transfer notice that I have retaken the class or not? \n\nThank you",

When you apply for transfer, you can write explanation for this, and they will understand. Of course if this repeats many times, they won't believe you, so make sure you put extra care on those and other courses.",

The financial aid department offers a lot of resources, so schedule an appointment with a financial aid counselor if you need help. Once you retake the course, your gpa will be updated and the D will be replaced with the higher grade. The D will still show on your transcript and colleges will see it. It's not the end of the world. Like the person above said, make sure to include an explanation of it on your application and do well in that class if you do retake it. Good luck!!",

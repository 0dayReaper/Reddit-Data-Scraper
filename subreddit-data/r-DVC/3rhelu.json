            "comment": "ive taken 110 a long while back, its relatively easy if you understand the concept. Taking 255 on my extra time atm, its really easy, and is almost like 110(its actually closer to maybe 165) as java was designed to be a more simple approach to C++\n\n\nat the early levels, the primary difference is that you'll usually be outputing data in console for C++ applications, and for java applications, its primarily option panes. For the most part, both will share a lot of syntax and structure (e.g variables, loop syntax(e.g if, while), structure) but will vary on small syntax for clarity(e.g CONST vs FINAL, headers)",

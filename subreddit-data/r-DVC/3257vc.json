            "comment": "ive taken czapla for 194 and parks for diffeq. Czapla is a more standard teacher and her teaching style is very off the book, so if you cannot understand the book, the math may or may not be hard for you. Her tests aren't that hard, and are similar to her quizzes. Parks is a nice guy, but he often is really forgetful and makes alot of minor mistakes. If you are one who likes to actively participate with the lecture, you do so more in his class. His flaw is that he is often not prepared to teach and sometimes chapters may go slow.",

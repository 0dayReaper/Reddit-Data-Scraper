    "postText": "My registration date is this Friday, and I'm noticing that every single class I planned on taking has about 15 spots left each. Is it just harder to get classes in the fall than in spring? \n\nDo you think that these classes will fill up before I can register?",

So your sign up date should gradually be better. if the class has 15 slots, moderately well chance of getting in depending if the teacher is likable or a class everyone needs. Crash classes if you have to get a class.",

I couldn't take English 122 until my second year because it fills up so fast. I believe if you take a class where someone is part of dss and you take notes for them you get priority registration for the following semester. But if they fill up, EMAIL! That way when you show up day one and there's a spot left after the waitlist, you most likely won't have to fight the other students for that spot. ",

But at the moment, does this mean I can't sign up for any of my necessary courses for IGETC/Comsci? \n\nThe only thing I could sign for are random classes that fulfill the general education like ADJUS...should I just sign up for the easier math/english classes and then wait for my assessment to come through before registering for other classes? damnit!",

Unless you have passed that in high school, and submitted proof of it, you won't be able to sign up for the introductory programming class.\n\nThere are a couple compsci classes that don't require math 90, such as Comsc 255.",

For any class, you have to complete the pre-req(s) the semester before.\n\n255 recommends 110, but it's not required as it's a beginning java course. As long as you have knowledge of computers and some prior programming experience, 255 shouldn't be too bad. (I'm signed up for 255, but have not yet taken 110.)\n\nIf you don't have any prior programming experience, you shouldn't take 255 until you take 110. \n\nSadly though, all of the Comsc 110 classes are full, as well as Comsc 255. Looks like you're going to have to wait until next fall to take them. \n\n",

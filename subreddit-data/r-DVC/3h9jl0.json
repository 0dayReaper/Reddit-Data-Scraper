The reason its mostly international students is because legally the only jobs they can hold are on campus jobs. It's not too difficult to get the job though they are competitive, most people burn out so if you stick around and do good work you'll be somewhat recognized. There are jobs in various departments but mostly its service type jobs helping people in either the admin buildings, or being a cashier at the bookstore or cafeteria or helping people at the student life office or working in one of the departments as a paid aide, though those jobs are much harder to come by.",

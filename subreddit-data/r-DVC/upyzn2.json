Or if it is just for dvc degree, as long as dvc's office is fine with you skipping, you should be ok.\n  \nIf you have a school(s) that you want to transfer, you should look at that schools transfer requirements, which you can find at: assist.org\n  \nIf psych major specifically says you need trig: you do need to take it, unless you contact them and they say you may (for example, ap test scores).\n  \nIf psych major doesn't say you need trig, but requires higher math course: you can skip them in dvc as long as you take those required courses.",

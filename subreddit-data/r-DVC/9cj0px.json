    "postText": "I know it is a little early to talk about Spring 2019 semester, but I am worried that My portal shows \"No registration date\"(\n\nthe spring registration will start late November) right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the past I always saw my priority registration date way in advance in my portal. According to DVC's academic calendar, all registration dates are set for Spring 2019 term already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCould you check your portal to see if you see your registration date? If no one sees one, I will just wait.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

I went to the admission office. The lady looked it up in my file and said they system showed that I turned in the form, but no early registration date has been assigned yet. Very frustrating.",

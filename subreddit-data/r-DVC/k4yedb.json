    "postText": "STEM takes forever I heard, especially CS, so I decided to just get two of the first math courses I'll have to take out of the way. MATH-121 in the spring, and Pre-Calc the summer before my first official semester at DVC. That way I start at DVC with Calc 1. The only professor that fits with my timings is Dmitry Zhiv, who seems to be a sorta bad teacher judging from reviews online, but oh well. It is only trig. At least I don't have to take calc with him :)",

Definitely check it out. Good for you getting ahead. The physics/chem series also takes a long time so don\u2019t lag on that. I would go to assist.org if you haven\u2019t already",

But great to start early, it does take a while to get through STEM majors, I know many students who apply to CAL also do the prep work for other universities as well, the challenge is that other COMPSCI programs require a lot of other classes like physics and certain math courses that berkeley may not require.",

You have the option to challenge the prerequisite requirement. To do so, please complete the Prerequisite Challenge form. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes this mean I have to wait until registration and I will only be able to enroll in classes with available seats if I'm lucky enough to clear my prereqs?",

There's gonna be a ton of people doing the same thing so patience is your ally here, but I would talk to the dean of the math department about it. Counseling is also recommended if you can get a quick appointment to ask them how to approach it too, and admissions to clarify any other options you have to clear the prereq",

    "postText": "Hey all.\n\nI'm doing a career change and going back to get into culinary arts. I'm registered and everything but I'm not sure about some of the uniform requirements as some classes allude to them. Do we need to purchase special footwear or a chef's jacket? I feel like when I sign up for classes, they'll inform me but part of me would rather buy them now than wait until December to know. Has anyone done some of the culinary classes and has advice?",

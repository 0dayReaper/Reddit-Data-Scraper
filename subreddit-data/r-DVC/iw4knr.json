So assuming it is a class you need and you think you'll like the professor there is no reason you shouldn't take the class through the san ramon campus. Im just pretty sure you can't take everything you will eventually need at SR. Everything is online right now anyway...",

But now it\u2019s all online so it doesn\u2019t matter. I would just look up the classes you need to take, search the available courses and then creep through ratemyprofessor and pick the best teacher for each course. Since everything is virtual there is nothing stopping u from having back to back classes at separate campuses! But for in person I recommend pleasant hill. If you want to \u201cstack\u201d ur schedule in blocks, this is the better campus to do so.",

            "comment": "The campus is much larger than I expected when I started at DVC, so make sure you know where your classes are located by checking the map and figuring our where the different buildings are located. Also, depending on your classes and how close they are together, (i.e. does one class start right after another ends) you may have to run across campus to make it to class on time.\n\nSo far, the people I've met there have been very friendly and the teachers are supportive, but there isn't a lot of structure to the campus activities. Sure you can go to whatever thing is scheduled on campus on a certain day, but DVC is lacking in clubs and programs, so if your classes are scheduled far apart (an hour or more break between classes) there isn't really anything to do.\n\nIf your driving there, you definitely want to arrive early. However, you can also take BART and a DVC specific bus route to get to campus and back.",

            "comment": "If you drive, get to campus early during the first month because parking lot fills up fast. You can kill time at the library, cafeteria or really any place you can sit down until your class starts. \n\nAlso get a parking pass, its cheaper then a single parking ticket and day passes rack up fast if you are on campus multiple times a week. After the first few weeks they start to ticket people who don't have a parking pass or a single day pass. The ticket is like 40 bucks which is almost the same as the semester long parking pass. \n\nThere are places people hang out on campus. If its still open the rec room is under the student union and people used to play magic the gathering and other games there. There is also a PC lab where you can type up essays and work on that kind of homework in the same building, just bring a flash drive and get a print card from the people running the desk in the building.\n\n Join clubs, its a great way to make new friends and pick up new hobbies you enjoy. When I attended there was a gaming club, a league of legends team, and a bunch of other student clubs. Soccer club was cool too, it was basically Friday pick up games.\n\nThe Book center has Los Panchos burritos that are a nice hot lunch that are tasty and fairly cheap. They get stocked around 9:30 usually dont sell out until 1ish.\n\nThere is free tutoring in the Learning Center, its some times hit or miss  but worth checking out. Also most teachers have office hours, take advantage of them. Most teachers are chill and willing to talk about anything related to the class, though they normal recommend checking out the tutoring if you hadn't gone there first.\n\nIts worth checking by the financial aid office even if you are in a middle class family. There is a fee wavier that can drop the $46 a unit cost which adds up very fast.\n\nLastly don't buy any of your text books until after attending the first class session. Frequently you will have options for the text books that aren't listed at the book centers website. Sometimes teachers allow students to use older additions of the book.",

            "comment": "Lovely cafeteria/buffet/pattiserie/chocolates and dining area, nice big pond, great always warm library, updated open central area with plenty of seating, duck poop, cool little observatory, pretty and peaceful secluded areas, lots of stairs, and a big field. The non-classroom indoor buildings are nice too. The student bookstore/cafe is always busy, not too long of a wait generally. People from all ages.  \nLibrary info:  \n\nIf you like the library, volunteer for the Student Technology Help Desk so you get a huge study area. It does not get a lot of traffic as it's a new position, and people usually only ask where the printers are, how to connect wifi, and most questions usually asked are to be directed across the room to the library staff and volunteers. Like 15mins of talking time there per 6hours of studying. The computer there is the same as the ones in the computer section.  \nIf you prefer helping behind the desk, 99% foot traffic goes to the library desk so ask them to get situated. Lots of big and small shared tables and there's a section of cubicle/divider-style desks too. Lots of art in the library and on campus. Again, it's always warm.It's on the second floor but there's no bottleneck as the stairs is wide. There is a bottleneck at the printers tough, so make sure to get a student ID and put a few dollar bills in there to save some time. What else... if drop of/pick up at the library side, it's not a long walk from cover if it's raining, so that's nice people don't have to wait in the rain.\n\nIf you drive or uber/etc:    \nSeriously, arrive 1-hour before your class. Arrive at 7am if you can spend the whole day there because parking and traffic is intense. The campus shares a street with a highschool and a gradeschool, and the back half of campus to be surrounded by homes and apartments. On the other side of campus is a mall and shopping plazas. A freeway is real close too, so all of these would explain traffic. It gets backed up real bad peak times 7:30am-3:30om, and the parking lot is generally a mess 7:30am-6pm. However I imagine covid safety would minimize traffic/parking greatly. Also, just get the semester parking pass. Saves headaches. Car break-ins are plenty so leave a box of tissues at the maximum, sometimes even a sweater is too much (my experiences).  \nIf you take the bus, no parking lot stress as the bus depot is next to an exit and stoplight. Can watch people play tennis while waiting.\n\nThe campus is cozy.  \n\nEdit: forgot to mention there is a nice quiet computer/tutoring lab, asking for tutor help is not required unless it's during a specified time window which will be posted in front and in advance. So it's just another computer lab if the one in theibrary is full.",

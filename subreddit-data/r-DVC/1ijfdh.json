    "postText": "A number of policies have changed recently that affect first-time students, so here are some basic steps you should complete before you begin classes at DVC. This guide covers students who just recently graduated high school, and other adult students who haven't attended college:  \n\n1) Get a copy of your *official* high school transcript. You can either have your high school send them to the Admissions office for you, or you can hand-deliver them in person. If you deliver them in person, it is extremely important that you do not open your transcript! If your transcript is not in a sealed envelope, it will not be considered official and you will have to go back and get another one.  \n\n2) [Apply to DVC.](http://home.cccapply.org/) You must (obviously) apply to the college in order to attend classes. The first 3 pages of that link are to setup an account with which to apply, then there will be another 9 pages after that. High school graduates and first time ever college students, **make sure you choose Summer on your application.** I will explain a little later. After you apply, you will get an email within 24 hours that contains your student ID and your login information for the InSite/WebAdvisor system which is used for registering for classes as well as some other important functions.  \n\n3)  The reason you want to apply for Summer is because in order for first time students to meet with an academic counselor is to take a class called Counseling-095. This is an 8-hour course that introduces you to the processes at DVC and you will have a chance to plan out your courses with a counselor that will meet your desired career outcome. This class is not mandatory (unless you want to meet with a counselor), but it a really good first place to start and it will set you up for priority registration in the Fall.  \n\n4) Take your assessment tests. You can either use your classes from high school to meet general education requirements (this is why you got your transcripts earlier), or take assessment tests to place into your English and Math classes. You can make an appointment for your test [here,](http://www.dvc.edu/org/departments/assessment-center/) but you will need a student ID to complete this process.  \n\n5) Register for classes with the InSite/WebAdvisor system. There is a lab available with computers reserved specifically for registration, financial aid, and assessment purposes. This is next to the Admissions office and behind the Welcome Center.  \n\n6) Attend classes! **If you don't go to the first day of classes, you will be dropped!!!** Like, immediately. There are WAY too many people trying to get into classes to allow absences on the first day anymore.  \n\nMore info about the admissions process can be found [here.](http://www.dvc.edu/highschool/apply/Enrollment%20Guide%20for%20new%20students%202013%20updated%20Feb%2012.pdf)  \n\nNOTE: if you're an adult first time student who has been out of high school for 5 years or longer, don't bother with the transcripts, just go straight to the application, then on to assessments.",

            "comment": "Something to add.  If you want to take a class and webadvisor says its full, show up the first day anyways.  If enough people don't show up and the waitlist leaves seats empty, the professor will start to add people.  If you email them ahead of time and let them know you're trying to add in, there's a good chance they will give you priority to everyone else who just showed up.  ",

            "comment": "I would say more like a chapter a day. I took precalc with Mark Rinker over the 6 week and it was very important to stay ahead on the reading. He expected us to ready the chapter before coming to class each day so we were already somewhat familiar. It was hard and not gonna lie I cried in the beginning and wanted to drop but EOPS said I would be kicked out if I dropped the class so I stayed and I ended up with over 100% by the end of the course. It\u2019s kind of nicer to do math over summer in my opinion bc you can give it all of your attention. I also took linear algebra with Lynn Knight over the three week and it was INSANE literally 3 hours of class 9 hours of homework every day but I was able to get an A in that class also.",

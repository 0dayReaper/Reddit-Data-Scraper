    "postText": "Basically, I got overwhelmed and burnt out and I kind of didn't meet SAP (academic progress stuff) in Fall of 2013, so they suspended me from financial aid.\n\nThe big problem is that I don't really have any paperwork saying why I sucked at being a student when I did. I can show proof of taking 10 units over the summer of 2013 and being burnt out from way too much school, but I'm not sure if that's really good enough.\n\nAlso I did just get out of an unhealthy relationship that caused me to move 1000 miles away from home, but I'm not sure how to prove that either?\n\nI feel like I'm never going to be able to go back to school ):\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with appealing financial aid stuff? Are there any pointers for this sorta thing?",

I have gone through the counseling center for their external counseling services, but I never followed up on it, and I did work with EAP but I quit after one session, because I felt like I was a burden and that I should actually save the help for people that need it more than me.\n\nThanks for your advice though, I really appreciate it.",

I'm researching some colleges that I could join next year (DVC is so far my top pick) and I would like to get some of your opinions about the school, including those of you who have graduated from it. Does it offer good career opportunities or no?\n\nThank you",

Some fields need a bachelors and there's no getting around that, but the quality of instruction at DVC is as good as anywhere else and a lot of the professors, especially in niche areas are currently working in their industries and teaching on the side and offer an interesting perspective and can help you network. I've been to a LOT of colleges including some fairly prestigious/expensive 4 years and I'd say the education is on par. \n\nThe most important thing at dvc, if you care about graduating within 2 years is to come in with a plan, stick to it, and keep your GPA up. It's really easy to take a full load of classes for and still make little to no progress towards your degree if you're not paying attention and dvc counseling is fucking impossible to make an appointment with and not very helpful. Read the IGETC/degree requirements.",

I'm at Berkeley now and I kind of miss the amount of access you have to the professors at DVC. Office hours are always way overcrowded here.",

DVC is fantastic, better than my state school experience even. At dvc I did chem club, debate team, and student government. It\u2019s what you make it really, get active and don\u2019t just dip off campus. \n\nLike other people said the science departments are top notch. In fact I had other classes that were taught by professors who were teaching the same curriculum at Berkeley as well.",

            "comment": "Current Psychology Major,\n\nDVC is a good alternative to starting at a 4-year school. Most of the professors teach at DVC and other schools, which shows how dedicated they are as teachers. For instance, many teachers I\u2019ve had so far also teach classes at SF State.\n\nIf you decide to go to DVC and you take on a full load of classes (12 units worth) then you can apply for free tuition for two years. You can only get that option if you keep up that pace without failing/missing classes, so keep that in mind.\n\nThe campus itself is pretty large, and depending on your schedule it can actually be hard to physically get from one classroom to another if they\u2019re on opposite sides of the campus, so if you have a physical disability, or something like asthma, make sure you know where your classes are located, and plan out how you\u2019ll get to them.\n\nAlthough right now of course most classes are online, and so far the online stuff has been good. They started off pretty badly, but now the teachers have had time to learn to use the software (Canvas) and it\u2019s gotten much better. If the pandemic is still happening and you join DVC, make sure to sign up for at least one class with live Zoom meetings. Those are the classes where you know for certain that the teacher cares enough to actually teach you online, not just set up a bunch tests for you to stumble through.\n\nDefinitely sign up for the groupings if you can. I don\u2019t remember exactly what they were called. They were a new thing just for 1st semester students, and they basically took people who shared similar majors/degree requirements and put them in 3 classes together. It\u2019s a good way to create a fast-paced schedule, and it sets you up with a Counseling course that teaches the students how DVC works. The special Counseling course was ONLY available to people who were in these grouped classes. As someone else said, counseling appointments are difficult to make, so having access to a counselor anytime during your first semester is great.\n\nOne more good thing about DVC, there are an unusually high amount of foreign students, veterans, parents, and other people you generally are less likely to see at a UC. You\u2019ll be able to meet much more diverse people, and it\u2019s really great to include all of those different world views in an educational setting.",

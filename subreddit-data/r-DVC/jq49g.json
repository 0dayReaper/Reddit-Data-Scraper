Remember, the last day to drop a class and still get a refund for any units paid is August 25.  The last day to drop without a \"W\" appearing on your transcript is September 9 and the last day to drop *with* a \"W\" is November 18.  **If you drop a class after November 18 then you will automatically receive an \"F\" on your transcript for that class.**",

I learned a ton, and made sure to take courses that were focused in the areas I was interested in pursuing as a career. I think I took 5 different courses with professor bhimji. She was an amazing professor and cares so much about your education and career there after. I cannot recommend her enough. Some great professors for the courses you'll take.",

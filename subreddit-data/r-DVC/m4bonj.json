    "postText": "I created a huge problem for myself. I originally began at DVC in 2013 for ECE. Sang about firetrucks and said it wasn't for me. I jumped through majors over the following years (mostly Math), but eventually went back to ECE. I'm officially set for transfer this Fall and now I'm doubting myself again and want to change my major to English Ed., but I don't have any of its prerequisites under my belt. Question is.....\n\nShould I just stay at CC or transfer and change my major at SFSU? I can't see myself completing a child development major and actually enjoying it. I've worked as a peer tutor on campus before and a class tutor for statistics (completely voluntary but had wild success), so I know I have a thing for teaching. \n\nAlso note: I used up all the financial aid for lower division...",

So, technically you can transfer as physics major and declare as math major, for example.\n  \nBut, generally engineering majors are declared as they transfer so no one can declare into or out of major that you transferred with. So, you basically have to ask how the college works, as jt is different by school and departments, but I can see it being very \"possible\", not guaranteed.\n  \nAnother thing to consider, though, is while you fulfill req for your desired major, you'll spend extra money in 4 year college. You might want to stay at CC to save money while taking \"easy\" courses at DVC.",

    "postText": "How is the attitude towards Community College transfer students? #EECS #CS\n\nHi, I will be attending DVC (Diablo Valley College) and taking EECS related courses which can then be transfered to UC Berkeley courses for the next two years. What are my chances of transfering to UC Berkeley EECS or CS after taking courses from DVC. \n\n1)How is the competition among transfer students? \n\n2)What are your recommendations for my next two years?\n\n3)What happens if I am not accepted?\n(This is due to a youtube video saying that only 70 people out of 1116 students were admitted to eecs as cc transfers)\n\nNote: I dont want to apply to CS L&amp;S I want to apply EECS for a BA .\n\nThanks.\n\n",

If you take any high math or physics class, most people will major in CS or EECS. 2. Get high grades (like 4.0 GPA) as much as possible. For additionals, try Hackathon or clubs (Dvcoders, etc), interns, etc. 3. Berkeley is very competitive and there is high chance of you not making. (I don't want to judge you. This school is just very hard to get in. Not only for you but for everyone) I would recommend you to look for secondary choices just in case like UC LA, Davis, Santa Barbara, or other CSUs.",

UCB does not had any TAG agreements with DVC (unlike some other UCs), so there is no guarantee you will get in. If you're Hell-bent on that major, you'd better have some backup schools.",

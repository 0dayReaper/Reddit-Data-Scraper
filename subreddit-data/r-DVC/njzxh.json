The position of IT at each school has been absolved into a district-wide position, and it is affecting us dearly. I am planning on getting on the district technology committee so that i can start raising awareness of our needs as student as well as provide insight to the technically less-inclined.",

Also, the website shutdown information was on the DVC website and they said to make sure to bookmark the Insite website since you can see the class schedule and do everything you need to on there, it was kind of small on the right side of the DVC website before shutdown.",

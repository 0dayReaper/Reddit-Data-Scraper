    "postText": "Hello everyone. I\u2019m going to college in the fall, but my mom wants me to take math 192 at dvc over the summer instead of taking it at college. This is my last summer before going off to college and I have a part time job. I\u2019ve already taken Ap Calc at my high school but I fear that due to Covid learning  I didnt do well on the Ap exam. Should I take Math 192 at dvc or just wait for college?",

            "comment": "MATH 192 isn't very demanding and it's dooable over the summer as long as you're confident in conceptualizing derivatives, you should be fine. Especially if you took AP Calculus this shouldn't be a problem as you already have the intuition. Just pick the right professor through ratemyprofessors so that you'll have an easy time going through the course.",

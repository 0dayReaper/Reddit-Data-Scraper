            "comment": "I would highly advise you to avoid Muhammed Gheith.  He spends the majority of class going through proofs of physics concepts rather than explaining how to work through physics problems analytically.  There are unannounced pop quizzes every week.  When it's time for a midterm, the problems on the test are orders of magnitude more challenging than the homework questions.  There is no curve whatsoever, and he openly gloats about how many people are failing the class, won't pass, and how few survived last semester.  FWIW I haven't heard of many good physics professors at DVC except for Golightly.",

I don't know the process, but I'd rather just go and scrounge some change to pay for them instead of taking time away from studies.\n\nSorry for the unhelpful news.  Good luck.",

That happened to me; I forgot to bring my temp permit and got a parking citation. I appealed using that reasoning and got off. Make up some excuse about the temp permit (eg. it fell off the dashboard into the floor of the car.)",

They reversed it both times and eventually changed the sign.  You need to document/prove that you didn't do anything wrong.  If you go in and just demand something, they'll show you the door.  If you go in there with proof and a rational argument, likely they'll hear you out.",

            "comment": "Summer math classes are WAY tougher than regular semester classes. For one, all of the material is condensed, so there will be certain concepts you won\u2019t touch base on. However, you will have homework everyday and you will be tested on 6 chapters a week. If you can handle it, that\u2019s great! If not, then take calc 2 during the regular semester.",

But if you tire easily (like me lol) or maybe don\u2019t have that strong of a base in math, then I\u2019d be weary about taking it over the summer. \n\nJust keep in mind that Calc II is one of those \u201cweeder classes\u201d that people usually switch majors because of (various people I know have switched out of STEM because of it), so just be prepared to do a lot of studying over the summer.",

            "comment": "Cal III, but we skipped a chapter (rushed), and our professor passed out while grading, so subtitude came and asked what have we learned all this time.\n  \nAnyways, jokes aside (real story though), it is doable of course, if math is your strong field. Most people who ask this usually are. But, if time is in your favor, doing other things (such as internship, writing transfer essays, building personal skills, or most importantly, resting) is not bad. If you have no summer plans at all, then I say why not, but if you are debating between two, I would say consider the other.",

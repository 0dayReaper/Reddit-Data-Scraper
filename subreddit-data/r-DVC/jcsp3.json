Sucks for the tech departments, but college-wide it makes about as much sense as any of the other decisions that have been made in the past 3 months.  It all somehow always boils down to money, since they are getting so much less every year they have to make cuts, and this might somehow save them money.  Yeah, I don't believe myself either.  Sorry, I can't even convince myself.",

Interestingly enough, those were Deans in charge of classes that are actually required to take in order to graduate.  As far as I know, this new Dean teaches no classes, but I'm thinking they created this one due to the influx of soon-to-be-Dream-Act students, since the school is increasingly relying upon out of state tuition to stabilize its funding.

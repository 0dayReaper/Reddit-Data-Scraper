    "postText": "So, for some reason, I have this plethora of financial aid problems; I did last year, and I seem to be having them this year, too. Why, this is beyond me.\n\nI got a letter saying that my missing info letter was online, but it's not actually there when I go to the financial aid tab. Also, the email, is it basically saying that I was selected for verification? I'm so confused :c\n\nedit: also, I have no idea how to submit my taxes, do I have to print out of a form and submit them to the FA office? Because I filed but I can't use the retrieval tool since my parents don't file, ughhh.",

I visited their offices 5+ times initially and 2-3 times a semester after that due to random problems. It IS worth it though. Five thousand dollars for a few visits is an excellent investment of your time even if it is a hassle.\n\nMy advice is to bite the bullet and go in person until everything is straightened out. The counselors are nice enough and helpful when you finally get in to see them. \n\nGood luck.",

It's faster than trying to make an appointment with FA directly. Usually, your tax information is transmitted to DVC once you fill out a FAFSA. If you are under 25, then you may still be under your parents taxes and if they don't file taxes, you may have some difficulties in securing aid. ",

I just want to make sure everyone is going to smoothly sail still.\n\nI'm just concerned about my taxes because the FAFSA thing said that it assumed I didn't file. Can I clarify that with DVC's financial aid office, do you think?",

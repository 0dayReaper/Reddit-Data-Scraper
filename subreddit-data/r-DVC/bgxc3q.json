Often times, prerequisites that cannot be fulfilled at your CC will need to be done at the school you\u2019re transferring to. Walk into the career and transfer center at DVC for an official answer, though. I\u2019ve had great experiences with them. \n\nI\u2019m also transferring from DVC to Davis this fall, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re implying! :)",

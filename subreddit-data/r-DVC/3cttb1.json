I've fucked up taking Calc 1 once because of a bad professor, and found it pretty difficult to teach myself especially when short on time.  If you think you can rough it through the class and deal with a lazy professor while actually learning the material its worth it.  Otherwise you're going to be pretty fucked going into Calc 2 without a good understanding of the basics.   ",

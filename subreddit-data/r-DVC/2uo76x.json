I started playing with the WC3 mod, then Heroes of Newerth, LoL for a bit, then got into the DotA2 beta EARLY and haven't really moved onto any other MOBA's.\n\nI'm down to play any table top games tbh. I've DMed &amp; played fantasy games for close to 10 years. Due to people moving I haven't had a solid group to play with in this area for about 6 months. \n\nI've played D&amp;D 3e, 3.5, d20 Modern, Rifts, Ninjas &amp; Superspies, Heroes Unlimited, Warhammer 40k (6th ed), Pathfinder, Shadowrun 3e.\n\nJust need a decent group of players in the area, and a spot, to do the damn thing!\n\nIf you or anyone you might know might be interested inbox me.",

I'll see if he is interested and shoot you some contact info.\n\nIf you are really serious I am sure you could set up a table at a school event to look for players or even set up a club through Icc. If you gain club status you can get funding and a dedicated spot to play at.",

A different group in the same said room are Magic the Gathering players.\n\nWhat makes it slightly harder to start a video game group is of course conflicting schedules and bringing setups. Anyone willing to start a video game group pretty much needs to bring the said Console, as well as a TV for use.\n\n\nedit: rec room is the room below  the student union building. You know you're there if there's the asian dance group outside.",

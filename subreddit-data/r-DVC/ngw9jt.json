He gives a lot of hw: WebAssign is required and optional homework problems from the textbook that most ppl end up doing since the problems from WebAssign aren\u2019t enough to study from. I would suggest to do both the required and the optional hw. There are no quizzes but there are 4 midterms and 1 final",

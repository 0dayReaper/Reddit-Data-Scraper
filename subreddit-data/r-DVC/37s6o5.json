    "postText": "Gomenasai, my name is Ian-Sama.\n\nI\u2019m a 27 year old American Otaku (Anime fan for you gaijins). I draw Anime and Manga on my tablet, and spend my days perfecting my art and playing superior Japanese games. (Disgaea, Final Fantasy, Persona series)\n\nI train with my Katana every day, this superior weapon can cut clean through steel because it is folded over a thousand times, and is vastly superior to any other weapon on earth. I earned my sword license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day.\n\nI speak Japanese fluently, both Kanji and the Osaka dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about Japanese history and their bushido code, which I follow 100%\n\nWhen I get my Japanese visa, I am moving to Tokyo to attend a prestigious Community College to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become an animator for Studio Ghibli or a game designer!\n\nI own several kimonos, which I wear around campus. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to Japan, so I can fit in easier. I bow to my elders and seniors and speak Japanese as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond.\n\nWish me luck at DVC!\n",

It gets like a quarter of the traffic the one on the first floor gets, is usually pretty clean, and is one of the newish buildings so its a little nicer overall.\n\nDon't tell anybody.\n\nSome of the older buildings arent that bad but are pretty bare bones. No mirrors or anything. What do you recommend?",

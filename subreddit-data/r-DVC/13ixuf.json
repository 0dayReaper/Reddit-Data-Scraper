There are no speeches, only 4 essays, and the homework takes 45 minutes at most.  As long as you do all the homework and put some work into your papers, its a pretty easy A or B.  ",

But at 4 you should be able to park anywhere.",

I do not remember any speeches, but there's a lot of peer editing, and asking questions a few times is part of your grade for participation. She says herself that shes a \"mean\" teacher but shes actually really nice.",

Also if I remember correctly the professor concentrates on the structure of your writing, and you citation skills now than the actual ideas/content of your writing. It was all MLA when I took it. ",

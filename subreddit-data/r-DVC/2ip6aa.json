I've still yet to find a decent physics professor. Dropped physics the first week 3 times so far.\n\nIf you're part of any clubs, ask around for word of mouth recommendations. Ask friends. Ask your counselor.\n\nMore info would help here, what subjects in particular/what's your major?",

I'm in 231, and I've only had one teacher I wasn't completely impressed with.  Besides, there are only a handful of them.  You aren't going to be able to cater your professors to your learning technique.  You need to learn how to have different learning techniques.",

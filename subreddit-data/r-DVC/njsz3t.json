    "postText": "I'm major in economics. I use pass/ no pass for one science class and got P. Even though I ask the counselor whether receive P impact on the application or not, and she said using pass/ no pass system will not affect the application, especially for the non-major course, I'm still worried about what UC's thought. Is there anyone using pass/ no pass and finally got accepted by ucla or ucb? Sorry for the unclear expression. I mean do UC reduce the probability of accepting me because I use pass/ no pass?",

I think you can take up to 13 units as p/np to transfer to the UC, for CSUs, I don't recall if they have a limit. \n\nEither way, your good. Your major is more concerned with your major prerequisites over your GE courses.",

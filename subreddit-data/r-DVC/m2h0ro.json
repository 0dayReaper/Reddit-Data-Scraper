    "postText": "I am a senior in high school in and I will maybe going to DVC. I took 2 classes in DVC during my 1st semester of senior year to fulfill some requirement for my high school. And I just realized that in my freshman year I had taken a intermediate algebra class to get ahead and I was told by my counselors I wasn't able to do that for some reason. So I dropped out, however, I had just received a F on my transcript and didn't bother to fix it. I didn't really worry about it being that I signed up the equivalent of that class (Algebra 2) my sophomore year in my high school. And if I choose to go to CC route there is a big fat F weighing down my GPA. Is it possible if I don't include it in my application when applying to colleges after cc since I already took it in high school. Is there anyway I can exclude that class and not count it towards my gpa? Please help I don't want this class being the reason I get rejected from all my UCs.",

            "comment": "MATH-120 I don't believe is offered at DVC anymore. It is worth noting that the class is not even looked at by the university and is not factored into your transferrable GPA. The other option is that you can look to file for Academic Renewal to have the grade be \"removed\" from being calculated into your GPA. You did need a counselor to review your eligibility and sign off on it. \n\nYou can actually qualify for it in a number of different ways.

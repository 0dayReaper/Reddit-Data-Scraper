    "postText": "I am a senior at AVHS. I am interested in civil engineering (finally decided my major) but unfortunately I only have a 3.0 UC/CSU GPA and a 1340/1600 SAT score so my options are either LPC or DVC and transfer or go directly to somewhere like Chico State. I am leaning towards going to LPC or DVC because I want to end up at a good UC or Cal Poly SLO. My question is what is the difficulty of science and math classes, and how difficult is it to get into classes. Is DVC really THAT impacted? How hard is it to maintain a 3.3 gpa for a TAG transfer to UC Davis? I am taking 2 AP's and physics my senior year, and so far senior grades are...  \nB in AP Government \nB- in AP Calculus AB \nA+ in physics  \nA+ in Literature of Social Justice \nA- in Choir \nA+ in Lifetime Fitness  \n\nSo overall, much much better than my sophomore and junior year.   Idk, can an engineering student just tell me about the difficulty of classes here and how hard it is to get into classes?  Thanks so much!!",

            "comment": "as someone who transfered out of DVC to SJSU as a computer engineering major. the math courses are standard and not too hard, but not too easy. The only major roadblock as an engineering major will be physics, as DVC physics is fairly tough.\n\nGPA wise, it isn't impossible. I left DVC with a 3.47 gpa\n\nstarted dvc late 2012, finished in 2016(had one semester where I only took 1 class, tbh I should have taken more 15 unit semesters to get out faster, but pace is up to you). I left with like over 100 units, so realistically, you shouldn't need to be in the same situation I was in.",

But not impossible because most of the time You can be put on a waitlist and with the high drop rate it's likely you will get into classes. Keeping grades up is really on you. DVC has many resources and most instructors are helpful but it's very easy to lose motivation and fall behind. If you are willing to put in the time (I've never met someone who has transferred in 2 years) and  have the motivation you should go to dvc to go to transfer to a school you love.",

A lot of the questions were tucked away in different sections (ch 7 of the textbook, the study guide for ch 7, and the article about agriculture) but some of it she made up and there was nowhere to look for answers you just had to guess. I'm going to file a complaint at the end of the semester.",

And that\u2019s what I normally do for homework, just read the books but could not figure out some of them bc it was so ambiguous and even in the book didn\u2019t specifically answer the question. I\u2019m worried about the paper and final exam. I also emailed her three times and she never responded.",

Our goal is to guide students through the start up process, answer questions, and spark innovation. We will be having a project throughout the semester where groups will be in charge of creating their own start up (either made up or real) and going through the steps necessary to get it off the ground.\n\nIf this sounds interesting to anyone of you, feel free to PM me! Meeting times will be Tuesdays from 5:00-6:30. We are still locating an available room, but I will keep you posted.",

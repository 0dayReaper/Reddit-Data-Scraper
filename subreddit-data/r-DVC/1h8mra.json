    "postText": "Howdy!,\n\nA few friends and I will be moving up to north Cal. to attend DVC. We have yet to receive our full award detail, we just have BoG and Pell Grants so far on WebAdvisor. We thought we would of received our full amount by now so we can apply to the local apartments. Is this normal? if so, by approx. when should we expect our award letter to be updated? If its any help, we'll be driving up to DVC for Counsel-95 in July. \n\nQuick Note: I'm an avid LoL player looking for some folks to join at DVC.",

            "comment": "Typically, financial aid disbursements are made in two payments; one after the first 1-3 weeks after the semester starts, and another after the drop date. This is to ensure you don't \"take the money and run\" as it were. You *should* get an email when the award letter is available, but keep checking regularly. They will not give you information over the phone, you will have to check your status in person. ",

Would you happen to know if there is any way of receiving a payment before the semester starts(for an apartment down payment)?  If not, would explaining my situation to the F.A. building be of any help? ",

    "postText": "Bill Oye, the Dean of Student Life, is being laid off by DVC. It is unclear at this time who will be replacing him. For those who don't know, he handled matters such as academic probation, behavior/discipline issues and worked with the ASDVC. This is the second Dean position in a year so far to have been eliminated, the first being the Dean of Information Technology. However, DVC has added one Dean (EOPS) to the payroll.  \nEDIT: The Dean of Counseling has also been laid off, with three other managerial positions that work directly with students. ",

If you did well on calc 2, should be similar kind of experience.\n  \nWhat do you mean by senior? Are you a 4th year of high school or college?\n  \n(Ps. Sorry that I don't have experience with this professor. You probably already know this, but try ratemyprofessor.com)",

Generally it has higher risk than benefits. If you are taking this course for...\n  \n* increasing chance of 4 year college admission: Meh. Of course, it is great if you can pull out good grade out of this. But I don't think it worth taking your time and investment. CC (community college) courses don't really affect admission rate as much. It does increase your gpa, but I think spending more time on essays, and extracurriculars are much better.\n  \n* saving time because I'll attend DVC: great, go ahead. I assume you took calc 2 along with high school, so I guess you can handle it.\n  \n* gain some unit/skip classes when I go to 4 year college: good, but careful. You need to check if your college will take DVC credits. Also, DVC courses are easier than those from 4 years, so you might want to get foundation from 4 years.\n  \nI don't judge your ability or intention. You are probably smart enough to pull it, but I honestly would recommend spending more time on essays and extracurriculars (those that is related to academic fields. Good, but less recommended for volunteering physical labor). People underestimate extracurriculars; you can explore and develop your skills to help you find/solidate your intended major/field.\n  \nThis was a long text. Feel free to dm me if you want (idk how much I could help you thou) and good luck!",

The colleges I've been accepted to already have confirmed that they'll take my DVC credits as long as they haven't been used to graduate HS (which they haven't). I've got my hands full with extracurriculars(robotics) and I've already specialized in a bunch of stuff this year related to my intended major so I'm focusing on math because it's honestly my favorite subject.\n\nThank you for your advice, however\u2014it was helpful and reassuring to read that I have been doing things right thus far.",

    "postText": "libgen saved me like 200 bucks this semester. Type in your book title or isbn and it will find you versions to download for free. it's not a scam I just posted a few days ago about not having the phys 130 text. i found out what it was and got it all for free here. enjoy :) \n\n[libgen](https://libgen.is)\n\nedit: obviously it doesn't have all books but is has most physics, chem, math, compsci and probably English too (im just not sure bc im not taking any right now). anyways that's it!",

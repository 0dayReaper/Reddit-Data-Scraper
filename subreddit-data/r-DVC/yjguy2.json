I'm interested in becoming a forensic pathologist but I'm confused on what I should get a degree in. I thought biology or public health would be the best choice, but during a college fair someone told me ADJUS would be better for this career path. If I'm going to be working on the body, shouldn't I choose something that's health related?\n\nAny advice would help :\")",

Check out where you wanna transfer to and pick whatever fills most of the undergrad class requirements. A counselor can help you a lot. I think San Jose state has a forensics degree. Maybe that person recommended adjus as an intro into the field to get a job right away . Definitely try to get an appt with a counselor and see if they can help you out",

    "postText": "I came up with a system where students could put down their arrival and departure times to and from DVC and their neighborhoods on a chart, and others can find people to carpool with on the trips where their destinations and schedules match up. They can switch out the driver or work out gas money amongst themselves. This would help the environment, help with our atrocious parking problem, and maybe even help some people save on gas money.\n\nGood idea bad idea?\n\nIf it's a good idea, how should I go about making something like that?",

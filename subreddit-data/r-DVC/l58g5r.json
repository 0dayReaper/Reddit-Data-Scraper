I also have found that NetTutor only offers 10 hours of tutoring for students per semester, are these hours counted with the ASC tutoring?",

It\u2019s hard to get good tutors for 195 bc it\u2019s one of the last maths people take before transferring. When you go to the math lab they will ask you what math you are there for and they will try to place you with a tutor that can help you. I would at least check it out. Otherwise just try to make friends with someone who knows what is going on in your class and try to study together on discord or something.",

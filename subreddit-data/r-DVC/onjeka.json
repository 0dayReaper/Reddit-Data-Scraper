You could also visit the transfer center on campus and ask them. \n\nYou might want to go over them with people who are close to you (friends, family, etc) bc they might see ways your demonstrate leadership/creativity that you are too close to yourself to see.",

Free write to all the questions and review your responses to see which ones you feel more confident to refine.",

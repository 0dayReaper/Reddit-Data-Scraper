    "postText": "So, I just got \"Administratively Withdrawn\" from COMSC 110.\n\nThe reason was that I didn't take Math 110 yet, even though I placed into Math 120.\n\nThe person that dropped me told me he didn't know how to explain why taking the placement test, and placing into a higher class doesn't qualify as fufiling the pre-req. I emailed their supervisor, but have not heard back.\n\n(The pre-req for COMSC 110 is: \"*Placement through the assessment process or MATH 110 or MATH-110SP or equivalent*\")\n\nHas anyone been in this situation before? \n\n",

            "comment": "I have not been in that situation. I am fairly certain you will get it resolved though. You definitely qualify if that is the case and you did in fact test in.\n\nI had a similar situation last semester in which I was registering for an english class (i think) and could not register online. the situation did not make sense because i was in progress with the Pre-Req. I ended up going to the registration office and it turned out there was a problem with the system. This was after talking to counselors and teachers. Being shot down and told i was wrong... go figure.\n\nSo that is my advice. Go to registration in person with your paperwork. They have a lot of power\nGood luck.\n",

The waitlist is full, so even if I could register for it, I can't cause it's full.\n\nFor some reason it still says 5 spots are available, but the waitlist is full. I'm wondering if that is for the people that got dropped, so you still have time to resolve it if needed.",

I went from 15 units to 10 and now im scrambling to find a class that fits. \n\nShit happens bud, no sense in dwelling on it. Give it your best shot to rectify it and if that does not work, run around and try to add. \n\nI think you have some action as long as you are polite and assettive. Get it straightened out at the registrars office that you are eligible for the class. You can email the professor and explain what happened and the Prof. has a lot of leeway in who they add. I advise that you do it in private.\n\nThe email addresses are usually first letter of first name followed by last so jdoe@dvc.edu for Jon doe.\n",

I have heard from someone (an instructor) with access to the higher ups that the program will have serious cuts in the near future, including removal of at least one of the related degree programs. I have already applied to and plan to take some classes at CCSF being its a hell of a lot easier to get classes there. And forget about that accreditation thing, its all BS and will get wiped away here soon.",

However, she is extremely unorganized and an unclear lecturer online. Easy exams for physics standards, but you will be learning a lot on your own. I took her in the March transition to online, and I would suggest going with another professor who may be better with remote teaching. If you were in-person I would suggest her, but online is a no for me. Best of luck!",

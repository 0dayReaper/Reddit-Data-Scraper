    "postText": "I want to transfer to a state school and I will have enough credits (60) by the end of Spring 2016! However - The problem is the application to transfer is due October to November this year! Will they still look at my application if I don't have the credits fulfilled yet, but with an assurance they will be completed by the end of the year? I need 60 credits to transfer and I will only have like 50~ at the end of fall 2015. I've emailed and asked a counselor and unfortunately they haven't replied.\n\nAlso, is it possible to transfer with an undecided major? The reason being is that I looked at the prerequisites for the major I'm interested in on assist.org, and it says the prerequisites for it - microbiology and chemistry - which I am probably going to take in spring 2015 semester at the same time which is a lot with the other classes I'm planning on taking..  I've already fulfilled my science IGETC requirements despite that. ",

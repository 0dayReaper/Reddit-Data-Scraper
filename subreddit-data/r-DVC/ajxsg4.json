Many professors want this but some administrators aren't. (That's why we only had one 231 class on 2018 fall) Lastly, the class is very competitive to get in. Many cs/engineering major takes this class, so you might not get it due to class being full.\n  \nIf you can manage to get decent grade, go for it. But I wouldn't plan transfer/graduation with assumption of getting this class 100%. Hard summer class is always good only if you can get it.",

I'm actually a physics major at SFSU and need this class to take modern physics next fall since it wouldn't be offered in the spring. Thank you for your help!",

I'm not exactly sure how many sections they had, but I'm pretty sure they had 1 section because DVC only had 2 professor availble to teach it. After, admins thought \"since we had summer class, there would be less demand, so let's only have 1 section for fall 2018.\" They were wrong. Out of 20-25 max class, waitlist alone was as long as 20-30 people. Graduating students who absolutely need this class were in so much trouble. That's why there is possibility of things going wrong and people should have back up plan.\n  \nSince you are coming from different college, you won't have \"priority registration.\" You should definitely try if you want, but just be aware that you might not get it.",

Best thing to do is login to insite and see if you have a reg date. As for the class being offered in the summer, I would wait for the summer schedule to be released for a definitive answer. This will likely be around March/April at best guess, with the fall schedule following soon after. The schedule typically comes out at least a couple weeks before the earliest registration dates, so keep an eye out for the schedules so you can make registration that much easier for yourself",

    "postText": "Hi, I had a question regarding Fall registration. So I\u2019m currently in Calc 1 and registered for Calc 2 during the summer. I\u2019m planning on taking Calc 3 during the fall. \n\nMy question is, will I be able to register for Calc 3 on my fall registration date (5/4), or do I have to wait until my summer Calc 2 course starts? \n\nI hope it\u2019s the former, because I want to make sure I\u2019m able to sign up with a good teacher for Calc 3.",

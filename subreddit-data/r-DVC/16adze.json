I'm looking for a waitlist option, but I'm having a difficult time finding it. ",

They might reply with something like, \"you'll have to come to the first day and try to add, blah blah.\" But if the waitlist and add lists are too long, then usually priority is given to students who have emailed the teacher first. A lot of the time they will recognize your name from the email, increasing your odds of getting the spot. ",

            "comment": " p/np does not affect the transfer application. If you are looking to transfer to the UC, the maximum is about 13 units. I don't recall if CSUs have a limit, it might be 20 I think.\n \nAs others have mentioned, don't take p/np in major prerequisite courses. GEs are usually good to take as P/NP. Be sure to check in the catalog that classes can be taken as P/NP. In the catalog if it states \"SC\" it means student choice and you can take it as P/NP, \"LR\" means \"Letter Grade Only\" \n\nOne thing to note is that not all universities look at p/np the same way. You want to check in if you are looking to some private/out of state as they don't view p/np the same as the UC or CSUs. They may see a \"P\" as a \"C\"",

    "postText": "I have a question on IGETC certificate. I am only applying for UC schools as a transfer student, so I have not taken Public Speaking class. When I checked the progress in my portal, it said I was missing Public Speaking class for IGETC certificate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went to the admission and asked if I had to take Public Speaking class in order to get my IGETC certified even if I am only applying for UCs. They said I had to take it, but DVC chart (in paper form)clearly says it is for CSU only, and other transfer students said they got full certificate without Public Speaking class for UCs(unfortunately they are not from local community colleges).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to know if DVC will certify my IGETC fully(not partially) for an UC school without Public Speaking class. If not, I will have to take Public Speaking class in spring.",

Here is more depth requirement list:  \n    \n[https://www.dvc.edu/enrollment/counseling/pdfs/16-17%20IGETC%20final.pdf](https://www.dvc.edu/enrollment/counseling/pdfs/16-17%20IGETC%20final.pdf)  \n    \nIt says oral communication is required for CSU only. I don't think it does, but best way would be asking UC admission representative. Send a email or call.  \n    \nAlso, I want you to double check if your major does accept IGETC. For most of engineering majors, UC would accept but not require nor recommend IGETC due to lots of required classes related to the major.",

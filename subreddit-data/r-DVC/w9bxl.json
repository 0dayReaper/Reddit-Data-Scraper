            "comment": "Everything depends on you completing a [FAFSA.](http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) The Financial Aid office uses the information you filled out on your FAFSA to determine any aid you may qualify for. In order to complete your FAFSA, you must have filed your tax return for 2011. Like your tax return, you must complete your FAFSA each year in order to keep getting aid. That's the main reason people \"fuck\" up their aid, that and not getting C's or better in their classes. ",

                    "comment": "I've completed my FAFSA and it was processed at the federal level by mid-January. I'm not so worried that I messed up, because I triple-checked everything before I finished up on editing it for the last time; a teacher also checked it for me, as it was a mandatory assignment for one of my classes. My Cal Grant also showed no discrepancy when I went and updated my graduation status on the independent website.\n\nI was wondering more about the office times because I have this huge tendency to worry about things until they're done. Maybe I shouldn't, especially since it's summer break, but... It was more just a thing like 'hm, I wonder if people who have actually attended DVC for a year plus have more insight into this then I would.'\n\nThank you for answering my question, though! I guess I just needed to elaborate. Sorry.",

I meant office times as in when I should actually expect to see what I'm getting in terms of financial aid, because it's actually not up on webadvisor yet. I checked the page itself (the financial aid homepage), and I'm aware that they're experiencing delays, which is why I came here; I wanted to hear from you guys if they experience delays like this every year. It would certainly make me calm down a bit.\n\nI've already gone over the financial aid tab on webadvisor. My financial aid status hasn't updated, and neither has my missing information letter. I'm also a first year student, would that have something to do with it?",

Your best hope is to make an appointment with a counselor if the info doesn't show up on WebAdvisor. They WILL NOT tell you anything about your account over the phone. ",

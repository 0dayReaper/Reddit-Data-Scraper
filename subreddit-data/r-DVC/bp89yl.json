    "postText": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI\u2019m just graduating High School this year and planning on attending DVC for two years and then transfer to either Berkeley EECS or Davis ECS. So I any of you guys are a computer science major, can you please give me advice on what classes I should be taking. I have already looked at assist.org classes but I want to know in what order should I take those classes. Also what is counseling 095? Do I need to complete it to take classes at DVC? And lastly if any of you are a first year DVC student, can you please tell me the whole process from applying to registration for classes. \n\nThanks in advance to all the responses.",

I personally don't recommend this method above but if you are going for it, that's not bad at all.\n  \nIn Berkeley, there is class called CS61A, which was  \"specially made to drop people\" in LS trying to be CS major. So either way, you would need skill, and if you do have that, I think you'll do fine with declaring cs major. Yes, cs admittion rate is low, but I see plenty of my friends get into their target school with effort.\n  \nTLDR. You can choose other major to compete in higher admission rate, but UC would probably know you are interested in CS.\n  \nP.S. EECS is in engineering department, so admitted won't have to declare their major again.",

            "comment": "If you look into [assist.org](https://assist.org) and dvc class explanations they should have required and requisite classes.\n\nCompsci tree basically goes like this:\n\n110 -&gt; 165 -&gt; (200) -&gt; 210\n\nor 165-&gt; 260\n\nHere are some descriptions of those classes:\n\n110: introductory programming class. You won't need to take the class before this (101?) because that's wayy too basic. \\*\\*Take C++ class.\\*\\* Because as you go up higher, DVC only offers C++. If you have time, you can learn Java, Python, etc on your own or by taking those classes.\n\n165: advanced C++. It's advanced.\n\n200: Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Recommended, but not required. If you are planning 2 year transfer, you can skip this class. If you have no prior programming knowledge, I recommend it, but skipping this is definitely do able. With strong will, skip.\n\n210: Structure. The hardest class (no, not 260. This one). Be careful with this one, if you have no prior programming knowledge. This course contains various abstract concepts, and lab heavy. Labs were 80% of grade, and only 10% for each midterm and finals. Know how to program &gt; doing well on test.\n\n260: Assembly. Polar opposite of 210. Test &gt; labs. (Labs are still important though) Assembly is low level language just above machine language. Meaning, there won't be too much abstract programming concepts, but doing simple stuffs in detailed way, because assembly don't do stuff automatically like c++. I highly recommend professor Kennedy for this.\n\nFor other professors, I liked professor Lo. Also, professor Melvin. He is not the best, but if you are more of \"exam guy than a lab/programmer guy\", then take Melvin.\n\n.\n\nTypically, students will take 15 credit per semester. (4 semesters \\* 15 credit = 60 credit) But, you don't \\*have\\* to take 15 credit. You can adjust a bit. I recommend taking as close as 15 credit for first semester, then figure out how you would do in future. I recommend taking more classes earlier semesters so that you have more time for later to do transfer essays and whatnot.\n\nYou would need all Math classes as well. Cal 1, 2, 3, differential equation. Plus, Linear algebra (and discrete math). (discrete math is not required nor recommended, but doing so is good because, well, you will learn it later anyways) Linear algebra is easier than others, and you should be able to take it after Calc 2. I recommend \\*\\*professor Parks for linear algebra\\*\\*.\n\nYou need English, 122 -&gt; \\[123 or 126\\]. 123 is literature and 126 is non fiction. I liked 126 more, but that's your personal style. (I think for engineers, 126 would be easier)\n\nFor science, there are multiple path you can take. (Bio, chem, phys) I took physics, but you don't have to. I'll let you know if you are interested, but you can choose what type of science you wish to take. (which is really great)\n\ncouns 095 is one day counseling class, which tells you info like [assist.org](https://assists.org), insite portal and others. It is worth to take it. They should go over how to register, and others. To register, you would need to go to insite portal and look for plan/register. I think going to student office for help will be much faster. You can even have drop in advisor session.\n\nPlease ask more questions by comment or dm if you have more. Good luck!",

Even if DVC accepts ap score, if your future school that you want to transfer to doesn't accept it and requires 110, you should still take 110. If they do accept ap score for their class of 110 equivalent or don't have 110 in their requirements (only the upper classes like 165 and 210) then you can skip 110.\n  \nFor DVC, I can't tell by looking at their website but It should have some content upto 200 (object oriented programming) so I think it is very possible you can replace 110. But since ap cs A is in java, if you are not familiar with c++, you should just take 110.",

Also I live close to Los Medanos College but looking at their CS program it is inferior to DVC.  Thinking of taking Math and Physics and all GE classes at LMC and the computer series at DVC. Is that possible? Goal is to transfer to UC EECS/ CS. Thanks again",

All Contra Costa County college (CCC) that includes LMC and DVC shares the system so it is doable and even if you take classes on other community colleges as long as they have similar contract with UC it should be good.\n  \nFor example:\n  \nCollege 1's course A and B -&gt; UC's X\n  \nCollege 2's course C And D -&gt; UC's X\n  \nYou have to take either (A and B) or (C and D). You can't do something like (A and D). This prob doesn't happen in cs classes but it might happen in math.\n  \nI personally prefer all classes at DVC, but I understand people who live too far to commute.",

Still deciding about LMC and DVC but might consider LMC for all GEds, Math and Physics classes and will cross enroll for all CS subjects series at DVC to lessen the commute. The thing that makes me ponder is that DVC is an excellent CC and a feeder for UCs. In your opinion will it make a difference especially for EECS/CS? Thanks again",

So going DVC doesn't guarantee anything but just looking at probabilities, it is higher than other cc. Ofc you still need to work hard same regardless, but you can think about it with this in mind.",

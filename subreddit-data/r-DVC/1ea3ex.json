This advice came from my high school biology teacher who did horribly in physics because she didn't take it in high school.",

Tips, uhh I think its good to know how your teacher grades tests(depending on which teacher you get) and to spend alot of time understanding each and every concept. the concepts carry one through the chapters constantly so if you mess up early, its going to be downhill from that point.",

            "comment": "After taking physics in high school, you probably don't need Physics 129.\n\nThere are two big indicators for your likelihood of success in 130.\n\nThe first is how well you did in the high school physics class. A good grade there is nice, but what's more important is that the ideas there felt natural, at least after you got to play with them for a while.\n\nThe second indicator is your ability with math. You should be comfortable with Calc 1, but you won't need it for solving most problems; it's mainly used during lecture to show how we get the equations we need. For the problems you will solve, algebra skills are a huge advantage.\n\nOf the teachers for 130 in Fall 2013, Combs would be best.\nSome say his lectures are a little boring, but he doesn't require a lot of homework, and his tests are of average difficulty.\n\nNext best would be Conner. Enthusiastic lectures and very approachable during office hours, but his home work consists of challenge problems without the appropriate lead-in, and his tests are kind of hard. He is very math intensive.\n\nLast is Wilhelm.  Spends a lot of class time on derivations, uses Calc 3 and Differential Equations and and tells students to just memorize it, homework frequently uses side topics and special exception scenarios to try to teach the basics, tests are one third normal questions, one third weird side topics, one third questions difficult far beyond the scope of the class, at least for the time and resources available to you on the test.\n\nFor all of them, using the tutoring center and office hours, and doing the homework with classmates will greatly benefit you.\n\nSource: I've tutored physics at DVC in PS-110 for six semesters and have helped a few hundred students.",

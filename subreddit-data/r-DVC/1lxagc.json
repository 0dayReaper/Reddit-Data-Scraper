    "postText": "Pearson textbook monopolization at DVC has grown out of control over the last 2-3 semesters. Pearson reps are onsite nearly weekly now to either support their crappy online textbook system, or to try and get more and more instructors to switch to their online text delivery system. What does this mean for all of us? ...Higher prices and no print form for books = more profit for them and DVC. Just a little heads up for all of you and some explanation on the screwed up situation on campus regarding the $200+ books and course materials trend. And yes, its going to only get worse as they convince instructors to create their own \"custom packages\" and \"customized books\" (see ADJUS, COMSC, MATH, PSYCH, and more...).\n\nedit: also forgot to toss in \"Cengage Learning\" as well. The textbook monopoly at DVC is co-owned by these scumbags.",

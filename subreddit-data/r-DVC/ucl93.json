Just more political bs. :/\n\nI actually just take the 10% grade hit because i think it's bs. Depending on the teacher. ",

(one of my teachers was explaining it to me because they hated having to use aleks). So they made certain funding contingent on having stricter requirements to obtain it in hopes that some schools couldn't do it; thus having to send less money. ",

Also, the main reason I go to a community college is that I'm broke so It's difficult to have to pay an unexpected amount when class begins. If they insist on using Aleks, they should include a lab fee disclaimer in the course catalog. ",

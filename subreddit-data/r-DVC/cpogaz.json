It sounds like an extremely attractive class, but as a rising senior juggling college applications, how hard will it be? I don't want to fall into a ton of work and not have time to work on college app essays, but at the same time, I want to take a class at DVC. Please advise!",

            "comment": "Believe it or not, DVC has well over 20,000 students! All taking different classes. It\u2019s very hard to get a hold of not only people who have taken that particular class, but also who then have a good idea of how hard the class would be for you in your circumstances.\n \nThe advice I\u2019ll give though is that DVC instructors are extremely responsive to emails and don\u2019t mind an email from anyone. Look up the sections you\u2019re interested in signing up for and the instructor\u2019s email will be right there. Just go ahead and email them directly and be forthright: hey, I\u2019m a rising senior, here\u2019s why I want to take the class, here are my limitations - what are your thoughts or advice?\n \nThey\u2019ll be able to give you very direct and exact responses for their specific classes and they\u2019ll be happy to answer.",

Generally, online classes are easy in terms of workload, but difficult in terms of taking lecture and asking questions.\n  \nBut you mentioned writing college apps, so I believe you are planning to go to 4 year college straight. What is your intention for taking this class? This might not give you credit nor be used to clear other class' prereq. (4 year college is usually strict on this) I think focusing on college apps is better because I personally was so overwhelmed by it. (Not native English speaker)\n  \nEveryone has different strong/weak point, so you probably be able to pull it off, but if those that I mentioned above is what you wanted, make sure you check with your target colleges.",

I'm taking this class because I'm only gonna be allowed to take 2 APs, which is not nearly enough considering I took 5 last year; colleges hate negative trends. But more importantly, I looked up articulating courses, and BUS 109 fulfills the social science and behavior breadth requirement at a lot of he UC's, which is the reason I'm taking this class.",

I'm not sure, but I'm guessing BUS 109 is one of beginning classes and considering your school work, it looks pretty doable. Remember, you can always drop DVC class (check drop date) if something goes wrong. Then you can just not report your DVC transcript. Good luck!",

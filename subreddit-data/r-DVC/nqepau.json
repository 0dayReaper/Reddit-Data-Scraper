    "postText": "Hey all, due to time conflicts, I have enrolled in Calculus III at CCC after completing I/II at DVC. Did I totally screw up, because I read in [assist.org](https://assist.org) that to be considered for transfer to Cal, all series classes must be taken at the same school. I'm under the impression that CCC/DVC/LMC all qualify as the same school as they are in the 4CD classes in the INSITE enrollment program.",

    "postText": "Hi, uhhhh, graduated from Dvc in 2017, coming back for a second as-t, was wondering if Dvc had an esports program or club. I saw we have Fortnite players in top 100, and was wondering if there\u2019s like a community discord or anything. I am a rocket league player and coach (I\u2019m coaching a crl team soooo, I know what I\u2019m doing lol), and was just wondering if there is even a scene here. Thanks.",

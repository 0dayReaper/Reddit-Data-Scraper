The other alternative would be to take precalc in summer to get that over with. Hopefully, with the placement tool, you can place into calculus!   \n\n\nIf you look at the DVC assessment page (link below), there is a drop-down menu that says \"assessment overview\" and notes that the placement doesn't exist. The only assessment test students can complete is for chemistry. \n\n[https://www.dvc.edu/enrollment/assessment/index.html](https://www.dvc.edu/enrollment/assessment/index.html)",

Pre-calc provides an overview of some material that becomes relevant in each Calc class, but is not really worth a whole semester if you are already strong in algebra and trig. Going into Calc I, just be comfortable with knowing piecewise functions, composition of functions, ln and e. For Calc II, brush up on series because the unit moves fast! For Calc III, be comfortable with vectors if you haven't taken a physics class by then.",

            "comment": "It's in like April or May. If you look up registration dates on the dvc website you will see this past years dates and next year's should roughly coincide. You will be notified of your sign up date well before the time comes. On the first day of the new semester you can sign up for a virtual counseling appointment with a dvc counselor but the wait is usually a couple weeks at least. If you ask about prerequisites on here someone might be able to help cause it's usually pretty straightforward. Also if you filled out a fafsa form this year you can apply for financial aid online and it still applies for summer 2021. I would need a more specific question to help further with any of that.\n\nFill out a FAFSA form to get started on financial aid. This is pretty much all the info you need just click on the links\n\nhttps://www.dvc.edu/student-services/financial-aid/index.html\n\nThe link to sign up for counseling here:\nhttps://www.dvc.edu/enrollment/counseling/index.html\n\nTransfer requirements for different schools are here:\nhttps://assist.org/\n\nDvc specific prerequisites are easier to parse if you ask a specific question.",

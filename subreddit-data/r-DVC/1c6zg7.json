    "postText": "Hi there! Im attending DVC next year for the fall 2013 semester with plans on transfering to a UC. I'm planning on taking Counseling 095 during the spring semester. I was wondering if taking 095 will count towards enrollment in the spring semester giving me two semesters of enrollment so I can apply for tag in the fall.( I have a ton of ap credit).",

            "comment": "No counseling 095 is not transferable. And is barely a credit. There are a lot more classes you need to take to qualify for TAG and the difficulty in finding classes can set you back if you aren't always checking online for classes. There is only so much that AP credits can count for. ",

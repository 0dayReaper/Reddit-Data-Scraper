They don't mean to hurt me or anyone and I physically cannot keep directing my frustration towards them. I always apologize and I tell them that I love them and it's not their fault.

They had been raised in such an abusive and psychologically damaging home, and had never really been allowed to leave the house because of the classic weapon of the religious abuser. Homeschooling. They were just too scared and brainwashed to leave or do anything. Finally a 17 year old and one who was 20 something conspired to escape and get help. It seems like none of the younger siblings blame the older ones, even though the older ones were sometimes forced to participate in chaining up the younger kids.",

And then the government agencies in charge of overseeing all the Turpin childrens housing placements, restitution, medical care dropped the ball big time! \n\nThey completely fucked up everything, some were abused in their foster homes and were traumatized them further.",

Lot of verbal and physical abuse, psychological torment, called stupid, worthless, unable, useless and so on. It took me to find a girl who had a very healthy family to realize what had been done to me. Before that i truly thought that i was just raised in a strict but loving family, turns out it was just strict and shadowed by alcoholism and other parent's trauma. \n\nLuckily as i grew in physical size my dad wouldn't/couldn't put hands on me anymore, so i could actually confront him and actually make him afraid to be beaten this time. Though i didn't. Maybe me not doing it was a better lesson, to both of us. But it's no joke, children have 0 idea what is normal and what isnt, which is exactly why they should be a priority in healthcare",

So sorry that you lived in such matriarchy, i hope you know that your values are valid. Assuming it's ongoing its for the best to live separate from them, world has lot more to offer. If that's their will, then it is.\n\nAs for me, living in Finland it's way too common for fathers to have issues with alcoholism or trauma from parents, and he has since realized that he is being part of the same cycle, which gives me hope. But even if he didn't, i know what all that stems from and i have my own life to live.\n\nI think the most valuable posession anyone can have is offspring, and to that end you have won a lottery. Be a good parent, your children won one too :)\n\nI am glad i never resorted to that, violence is never the answer in family affairs. Pen is mightier than the sword afterall..",

Like very minor antisocial behaviors, voicing an outlandish political take or worldview, or really anything to see how the other person responds. Something minor enough that, if the other person reacts poorly, they can pass off as a one-off, or can just say, \"oh, you're probably right,\" and move on.

I'm not sure this particular post is the best example since abusing children to the brink of death is perhaps one of the worst crimes that one, let alone two people, can commit (I frankly don't know if you can be rehabilitated from that. But I'm not a psychologist or criminology expert.), but this thread still shows that cultural value of punishment &gt; rehabilitation. People demanding fucking water boarding, starvation, and death. \n\nWe complain about our recidivism rate, and we keep answering that with \"longer, harsher punishment\" and it never gets better and we wonder why. The answer to actually helping society is not punishment. Punishment is not an effective way to raise children, animals, OR adults. \n\nWe should keep people locked up while they are an active danger to society while they are actively, purposefully rehabilitated in society. Again, not sure this post is the greatest example of my point, but the comments definitely are.",

I agree with you, and I believe the prison industry is fucked and inhumane, but I also don\u2019t believe there is rehabilitation for people who commit this type of calculated and intentional evil against a child, let alone their own child. Can you imagine the sobbing and begging from their own child they had to purposefully ignore to starve him to that point?

I\u2019ll say that would not really deter much crime at all because if the people were to go back to society, they\u2019d have even further mental issues from the abuse.\n\nThe correct way to go about this is of course exactly what you said. Rehabilitation is how people are actually going to gain anything from being locked up. Putting people in a safe and secure environment while teaching them how to be productive members of society is infinitely better than throwing them in a pen with a bunch of dudes who could kill you at any moment.",

Cop was one of those that would taze, mace, and beat the hell out of innocent people and witnesses to his crimes (especially if videoed (which he\u2019d destroy)), and he was selling cocaine, prescription drugs, and weed in uniform on duty in his squad car. Was stoked when the troopers nailed him, but of course come court time piggy was found guilty (or plead, don\u2019t recall) of a minor charge of selling (only) some prescriptions and given probation! Within 2yrs he had a higher paying job as a cop in a small city 45min away. \u2026meanwhile the same cop, other cops, DAs, and judge sent many \u201ccivilians\u201d to prison for possession with intent and other bs. Wish cop got same treatment as a buddy of mine from the exact same area who one day woke up with an m16 barrel in his and his family\u2019s faces and many more itchy cops tearing his place apart, just for weed, then dude went to prison for a few YEARS (and not the nice easy segregated violence-free sentences that the extremely rarely punished cop gets)",

If you make a non grossly negligent mistake, you get something wrong, you do your best but fail, you shouldn't be as harshly penalized. \n\nHowever, if you are deliberately abusing your authority, intentionally committing criminal acts for your own gain, you should face significantly harsher charges. They should be felonies.",

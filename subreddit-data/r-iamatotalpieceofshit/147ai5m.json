I was hanging out with some of the neighborhood regulars on a prep day across the street from our set and they're all eating carryout chicken, like 8 or 9 people. It was as close to an impromptu picnic as you can get in the inner city. At the end, one guy, without missing a beat, gathers up everyone's trash that they had been leaving on the corner and just shoves it all right into the storm drain.\n\nI don't get many moments of insight into other people's lives that are as profound as that very often. I kinda just got stuck for a while rewiring my understanding of litter in the inner city.\n\nI was also buying a homeless guy dinner for a week or so for helping to sweep up extra trash around set at the end of each shoot day. We had piles of garbage bags that would get picked up late at night from designated corners. On the third day or so, I found out he had been diligently sweeping up like I asked, just sweeping everything straight into the storm drain, again. I had to give him some bags and ask him to just leave them so I could gather them up for collection.",

So a _jachtschip_ was a light pursuit vessel. Somewhere along the way, the word was bastardized by englishmen who discarded half the word and ignored half of the remaining letters when pronouncing it (anglos cannot into guttural -ch sounds).",

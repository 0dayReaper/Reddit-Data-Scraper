The area we grew up in was fairly diverse and at least in the church groups we circulated in, race was never really a question in who was attending or even leading in these groups. The open racism that you hear about still existing in various places straight up did not happen around us growing up. It was out of the question.\n\nIt was never brought up that people that were major figures in Civil Rights movement were *still alive*. And we were kids, so we had no concept that our parents were the same age as Ruby Bridges. The black and white imagery that's popular also also lent to the impression that it was long ago. I have since discovered that my parents (originally from OH and CT) are to this day very blind to the issues of institutionalized racism (redlining, for example).\n\nSo now my sister and I have been catching up on all these things over the past 5 years or so. I felt betrayed and lied to for a while, once the blinders came off. So yes, I expect we will cycle back around to another round of massive protests  even once BLM dies down. MLK was right about white moderates.",

One person who was being quite nice to them actually warned them to get out before sundown, but in this tone like he didn't want anyone else to hear him warning them. It was honestly scary.\n\nEdit: It appears I managed to get some details mixed up due to my bad memory. My apologies, I've been corrected.",

One evil lunatic can force ten good people into inaction, one evil lunatic can force five into silence, but when the parity between evil lunatics and good people gets around the one to one or one to three, the good people will behave evil so the lunatics won't kill them. A town like Harrison is one of those rare cases where the evil lunatics are the majority of the population.",

Even in the pre-Civil War era there were places in free states where black people weren't welcome.  Lots of anti-slavery people weren't anti-racist, they just didn't like the cost of labor being driven down.",

It's a white settlement town that has been trying to get independence from SA for years now already. They claim they aren't racist, they just don't like the government or the crime in S.A. Louis Theroux did a piece on it.\n\nMy (white) friend went there a few months ago to do some work for his BIL. I (brown dude) wanted to go with him just to see this place. Kind of like doing a tour of North Korea. But when I found out he was spending the night I was like nah. \n\nIn their defense, apparently it is super safe there. Everyone leaves their doors unlocked etc. But also, I don't want to walk around there and accidentally look at someone too long. And I definitely don't want to be there at night.",

They use the data to compare faster routes under different conditions.  They start with the speed limit, so it might suggest a main road that is a longer drive at first.  But if enough people take a shortcut and speed on a smaller road, Google will start suggesting it.  That's why their predictions are typically accurate, and you don't generally \"beat\" the estimated arrival time even if you're speeding.",

I still vividly remember in high school (this was 2007) going to an away football game with the band and our band teacher having to give a speech before we got off the bus to not let our three African American band members go anywhere alone. I found out why when grown ass adults and other teens threw trash, spit, and slurs at them as we walked to and from the bleacher stands. I almost got physical with a group of boys when I escorted my friend to the bathroom at that game because of some very vulgar comments made in her direction. \n\nMy grandfather who works in construction around and out of the state has told me that there are still tons of towns where you do not go after dark if you\u2019re a poc. I\u2019ve had people who have never lived in an area like this tell me I\u2019m exaggerating that it\u2019s still that bad. So many people in the US are insulated and have no idea.",

He returned in 2007, and in 2019 was recognized by mayor Jerry Jackson when Harrison issued its first-ever\u00a0Black History Month\u00a0proclamation.\n\n&gt;As of the\u00a0census\u00a0of 2010, there were 12,943 people and 6,043 housing units in the city.

Hide app that needs to code to the background    \n2. Open Google auth    \n3. Press and hold on desired code    \n4. Open recent apps and select wherever you needed the code in to past it    \n\nAegis:    \n1.

I've never used Aegis, so I wouldn't know how difficult it would be for that, but for Google Auth it's like, 3 lines of code to generate a QR code that adds a 2fa entry.\n\nThe hardest part is just storing the user secret on the server, and that's easy. Most libraries handle basically everything else for you, like generating secrets, creating QR codes for them, and verifying OTP with the secret and code.\n\nIt took me all of 10 minutes to implement it in a project, and the hardest part was getting the client JavaScript to display base64-encoded images.",

My point is that trying to approach that scammer issue from a socio-economic 'macro' perspective (which is what OP was doing) is a bit more productive than 'bad people do bad things'. Of course most poor people are decent enough citizens who don't systematically scam others for a living, but throw things like extreme poverty and unemployment rates in the 30-40% range and other causes for despair in the equation, and you'll see a significant increase in those types of petty crimes across a population. It's a societal issue and whether an individual or another happens to have a good soul and moral fiber is irrelevant there.  \nI don't think that's a hot take, and again, it's not excusing their criminal activities; just pointing out some obvious underlying causes as a more pertinent framework to start from.",

With appropriate tools, you can gain access over the scammer workstation and all the network it\u2019s connected to. There\u2019s a lot of ethical hackers on yt which shows you the process making them freak out when they redeem the codes they were told to buy first before the scammer, showing them their cctv and ultimately destroys their call centers. Unfortunately they\u2019re an army. Mostly based in India/Pakistan and often after cover up companies with a small % of legitimate businesses. Favourite and easier scam is fake amazon assistance calls to elderly people. Those are the branch trying to gain access over private accounts and then ask ransom money to have it back, or to take advantage to anything tied to your cellphone 2fa (bank accounts, whatever). My favourite reactions is when the hackers after a brief investigation call them by their real name having them on cctv, they freak out so well, much more than when deleting all of their files.",

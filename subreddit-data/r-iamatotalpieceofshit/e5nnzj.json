They must think that the day they leave management goes and looks but a lot of time if there isn\u2019t a rush they can not go in them for a week or two at least that\u2019s what my friend said. He had one tenant that left their pit bull puppy and no one sent someone to look at the apartment after move out for a month. Needless to say it was a tragic ending.",

I knew of someone who left a dog and cat in an apartment when they were evicted, and when someone found out, they called police. Police called animal control and AC rescued them, and the former owner was arrested and charged for abandonment or cruelty or something like that.  It would be worth a try. Fuck people who abuse animals, and thank you for saving this kitty, OP.  \n\nETA: Thanks for the gold, kind Redditor!",

His style is pretty unique amongst the authors I've read... he narrates in a way that you'd imagine your quiet uncle who's seen some shit would. His style varies widely, but he's best known for his fantasy and humor. My favorite line from Good Omens was in the description of one of the characters before you even started reading; when describing Crowley, it read \"An Angel who did not so much Fall as Saunter Vaguely Downwards.\"\n\nAfter Snuff, I'd highly recommend reading Good Omens and the Discworld series if you like his style. It might take a few pages to get accustomed to, but it's worth it.\n\nETA: misspelled a word",

Imagine Douglas Adams playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons with the cast of Blackadder and Monty Python, with Dan Carlin as the Dungeonmaster.\n\nGive it a try. If you like it, you will probably fall in love with it. I personally think that *Small Gods* is a good introduction,  followed by *Guards! Guards!*",

Turns out he started feeding the strays and basically took one in as a pet and let him in the house. Except he just left him. So now this poor cat keeps trying to get into our place. We\u2019ve been feeding him and have stuff set up in the garage set up for him, but we\u2019re weary about letting him because of my BF\u2019s allergies and until we flea treat the kitty. \n\nI have no idea what to do about the kitty. He\u2019s a sweetie, and we wanted a cat but were looking into British shorthair kittens. And because of allergies wanted a strictly indoor kitty. Not an indoor/outdoor.\n\nEdit: Wow, this got more attention then I thought. To answer some questions, we only moved in two days ago, so we\u2019re still kinda figuring things out. But for now the kitty (whom we\u2019ve named Ted) is being fed. The previous owner had him and another cat in the neighborhood neutered and set up a little shelter for them in garage, which is luckily where the boiler is so it\u2019s warm. \n\nThe plan now is to at least get him some frontline. Cause I don\u2019t the poor thing to have fleas. I think my BF might come around after a little bit of bonding. He\u2019s a big sweetie a the first day we opened the door and he ran in and just started purring and kissing us.",

I took him with me when I moved and he HATED being an indoor only cat. He became depressed and didn't snap out of it. After a few months he stopped eating regularly, and started misbehaving (urinating on shoes, etc). I was worried about his health because he lost so much weight and was lethargic. \n\nI ended up having to rehome him with my parents. He's a happy kitty again, but it took another few months for him to recover and start enjoying life again. Clearly he is NOT willing to be an indoor cat!",

They're good healthy cats, but not for folks with allergies.\n\nKeeping a cat indoors doesn't reduce allergens, as it comes from saliva on the cat's own fur when it grooms itself.",

So she basically lived in our garage and roamed the neighborhood, we asked the neighbors who had the cat about her and they said she comes by, but also just roamed.she was a wonderful cat, and was usually able to get into the garage before we closed the garage.sadly she passed a couple years ago, to some type of cancer after we noticed she had some problems and took her to the vet. So if your comfortable with a garage cat, just food , water and maybe a bed means so much to them.",

So we just fed him and left him alone. Well a month goes by and he doesn\u2019t show up to our house. It was strange because he visited our house multiple times a day to get his food. \n\nAfter a month of being missing he comes staggering a long, skinny with his bones poking out like he had been starving. We found out that he went into the abandoned basement of the neighbor\u2019s home when it was raining and couldn\u2019t get out. The neighbor had checked their house (probably to sell it) and that\u2019s how the cat escaped. He had been starving in the basement for over a month. \n\nWhen he came staggering along he was too weak to dart away from us. We could just pick him up with him not moving at all. We immediately took him to the vet and we were happy that he could finally be safe and get his checkups, but then we found out the cat had the late stages of stomach cancer. So it had been starving in a basement for over 30 days, and it had stomach cancer at the same time. It lived a very hard life. We had to put the animal to sleep and we were completely devastated because we  had finally been able to capture him so he could be part of the family. The vet said at least he got a warm hot meal, a blanket, and lots of pets when it was put to sleep. It died in my mom\u2019s arms. Fuck the neighbors who abandoned it. \n\nSo reading your story brought tears to my eyes. Please love and cherish it. I hope you keep it. He deserves a good life.",

I had to feed her electrolyte solution thrice a day every day and put her on a lead to go pee and poop.\n\nAnyway, about a month ago I found out from her new owner she had been missing for two weeks. She hadn't even put up signs or made an attempt to look for her. I feel so guilty, I thought she was good choice and now all I can think about is my beautiful cat dead in a ditch somewhere, or run over by a car or eaten by stray dogs. \n\nYou're a fucking bitch, Coco.",

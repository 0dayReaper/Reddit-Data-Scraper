His body language was also provocative and menacing.\n\nAnd finally, when all else didn't work and the innocent dared to give back just a little of what he was getting, he was immediately attacked.\n\nAt this point, the one attacked should be interviewing witnesses, getting names and contact information, calling the police, of course, and doing other due diligence to preserve evidence that might, if left for later, tend to dry up and blow away, so to speak.\n\nThats what he SHOULD do.\n\nOh wait!\n\nHe was just knocked out COLD.\n\nHe can't do any of these things!\n\nHe may have a concussion!\n\nHe may not be able to even THINK straight for the better part of a week!\n\nSo-this is STUPID-right?\n\nIt doesn't work as a methodology for dealing with some situations. \n\nIt's just not a workable plan of action.

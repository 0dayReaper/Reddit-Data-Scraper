There is nothing good in this trade, and their price is haraam. Concerning such things as this the aayah was revealed (interpretation of the meaning): \u2018And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing) to mislead (men) from the path of Allaah\u2026\u2019 \\[Luqmaan 31:6\\].\u201d\n\n\r  \n*The scholar of the ummah, Ibn \u2018Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: this means singing. Mujaahid (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: this means playing the drum (tabl).* \r  \n\r  \n*Al-Hasan al-Basri (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: this aayah was revealed concerning singing and musical instruments. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The interpretation of the Sahaabah and Taabi\u2019in, that \u2018idle talk\u2019 refers to singing, is sufficient.* \n\n The Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) said:\r  \n \u201cAmong my ummah there will certainly be people who permit zinaa, silk, alcohol and musical instruments\u2026\u201d\r  \n(Bukhaari 5590)",

And anyone who gives them aid. \n\nstep 3 burn all the farms, ensure there is no food or supplies to the army.\n\nstep 4 employ highly mobile troops to hit known strongholds with overwhelming force. \n\nstep 5 allow disease and malnutrition to kill the residents of the concentration camps, release the women only if the men surrender. \n\nThis was the game plan for the British victory in the Second Anglo Boer war. How you implement a strategy like that without the entire islamic world rising in jihaad i have no idea.",

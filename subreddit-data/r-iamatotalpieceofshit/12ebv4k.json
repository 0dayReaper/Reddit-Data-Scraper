In other words, waves break in a direction (left or right) and the surfer who is positioned to catch the longest ride has priority.\n\nIn the video it appears the female surfer had priority. I think pushing someone else mid-surf can be dangerous but we have little context for what came before. Obviously though there is no reason to be attacking anyone while paddling around\u2026",

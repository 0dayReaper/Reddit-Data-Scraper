Horrible trying to get the landlord to maintain the property. They've claimed for years that it was condemned because of their tenants,  but they rented that space at least three other times after we left, and the foundation issues that got the property condemned were things we had brought up at least 10 years prior.\n\nIn retrospect, I guess I'm glad I never advocated so aggressively for healthy living spaces to the point that I got myself shot. Seems like I made the right choice in saying \"you won't do your job, I'll find someone else to give my pay to for my housing.\"",

There is real earnest ways of making more money. Landlords are just gatekeeping a simple necessity. There is nothing productive they are doing for society. That house would still be there but in a more affordable and attainable way if someone didn\u2019t simply push their money to then make it far more expensive for someone else just so they can profit from it. And for the most part I\u2019m talking about the full spectrum of landlords. I can understand inheritance of a property and renting it out. Gobbling up as many shelters as you possibly can just to hike the rate and reduce the options. To pigeon hole someone with a basic necessity. Just so you can fleece them. You\u2019re just a selfish shitty person. You bring about a negative impact into society so you can have more income. Nothing of value is added to society by internationally holding ownership without need for the literal purpose of causing more financial stress on someone else just for the sake of your gains.",

Unfortunatly if its moral or not doesnt stop that everything that you just said is capatilism. Its called a rat race for a reason. I have a very hard time beleiving if the tables were turned you would be the same person bitching about the increasimg value wjen its your investment. Of course any sane person who puts hundreds of thousands, up to millions of dollars into an investment doesnt deserve to be able to profit off of renting it out. They assume the innitial cost, and all mantanance other than dad to day living they should be able to make money to make it worth their time. \n\nIf you do not live in a large metropolis landlords are alot more likely to be a familiy with 2 homes using it as an investment to retire compaired to this \"lamdlord boogeyman\" you are actimg like every landlord becomes. Yes there are shitty ones, but i have had more very good to amazing landlords vs pain in the ass ones at a 4:1 ratio.\n\nLamdlords are not the enemy, the system is! Lamdlords were just financially able to use the broken system to help their families have a better life the same way you or i would given the same oportunity. You are actingly like they are fuckimg you over, but without landlords anyone who could not afford a mortgage becomes homeless....does that seem better to you?!?",

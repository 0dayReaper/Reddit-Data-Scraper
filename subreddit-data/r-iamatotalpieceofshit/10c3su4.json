Best thing to do is make a report with the police, then the same day (after you get the modern, we are too understaffed to deal with this) everyone gets, go straight from the police to animal welfare, and when they get the police involved not only will it show you were wronged, but the police ignored your problem. This shows you tried both channels available and the one that would have showed up with 4 squad cars and a supervisor 3 minutes out if you did the same to her, did less than nothing for you because it didnt end in violence on your part.\n\nId personally have a hard time just leaving after that, and have a few ideas of what i would want to do, but that only leads with her being the \"victim\" and the other part the \"aggressor\" regardless of what happend. \n\nHope this guy and his new fish have a nice happy life. He sounded crushed as from what the video shows him as a caring person, and no longer has this cunt in his life",

It also just proves that she is possibly (literally) psychotic and he made an excellent choice leaving her crazy ass!!",

I noticed my fish totally recognizes me too! And now, when I clean its tank and transfer it to a different container, it won't thrash around like it did at the beginning. It totally trusts me. It will even swim right into my hand and let me pet it. I've won its trust. I had no idea you could bond with a goldfish before all this.",

As gold fish should be in Atleast a 20gallon all your going to need is a syphon (gravel vacuum) and one or more five gallon buckets from like lowes, if there\u2019s algae a little scraper would help too. Scrape off algae, then use the gravel vac to clean any gunk out of the gravel, while doing this also use the gravel vac to remove like 25-50% of the water (25 is my normal amount but goldfish are nasty so depends what your tank needs). From there dump out the bucket(s) of dirty water and refill them with fresh water (treat new water with fish water conditioner always). Put fresh water in tank.\n\nAlso you can teach goldfish tricks but it takes some work.",

Until that changes we are dependent on government law enforcement to enforce animal protection laws, or for a human or corporation to be coincidentally injured by illegal animal cruelty because courts recognize that they do have standing to go to court. \n\nMy personal view is that legal standing for animals is the most important thing for protecting animals that nobody is talking about. \n\nI was actually involved in a federal judge recognizing legal personhood for Colombia\u2019s cocaine hippos to come to the United States to get permission to serve a subpoena for evidence supporting their lawsuit in Colombia.

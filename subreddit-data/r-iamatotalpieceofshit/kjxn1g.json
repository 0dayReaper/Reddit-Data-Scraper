The police would take you with them for questioning although you don't need to say anything and you go home everything else is taken care of later you might get a call or need to go there again and then there would be a trial where you probably also wouldn't go to jail if it's the first time.\n\nUS law is so fucked up and diabolic for everything, it's normal to go to jail a few days for anything.\n\nIn my country in order to go to jail you need to do something really bad or need to be a hugh danger for the society or yourself although in that case you would probably go to a hospital or to an asylum (not the hardcore creepy one in my country it's more like a hospital but for psychic stuff.\n\nAnd even if you do something really bad you probably would stay at home and get hous arrest. Only if you fucked up really hard you might go into investigation detention/custody( direct translation) if there is a big fear of yoh fleeing the country (really bad murders or other super hard crimes.",

If this was any other type of work or leisure environment, safety would obviously be first. Without it we have rapists and aggressors free to attack others instead of innocent men proving their innocence and obtaining freedom an innocent man should already have..\n\nSafety measures should be in place before any jail reopens. They should be closed until they fix this problem. There is no room for this kind of behavior , they are treating innocent people like they are less than human, less than alive. They are treating self-designated \"criminals\" as not-human. They would fix this problem and apply safety guards immediately in any other scenario. \n\nHow are people so blatantly bigotists, its criminal! People should be held responsible for this kind of treatment. Charged and tried in front of a judge. This is clearly criminal negligence.",

Pulled a girl over for something incredibly small and insignificant, broken tail light, no seat belt, something like that. Girl is sober and looks like she had just gotten of work as a server from some chain restaurant. Girl just trying to make it home after a Friday night shift. \n\nCop pulls her over, decided now has probable cause to search car. Finds a THC vape pen. Now in the state of Texas the cop informs her, THC Vape *Liquid* carries a different charge than just regular leaf Marijuana. That in the amazing state of Texas being caught with THC cartridge is considered a narcotic and has felony charges that are attached to it.\n\nSo now this poor 19-20 year old girl, who is on her way home from work gets stopped for some bullshit insignificant violation and now is going to jail, car will be towed and impounded, job will certainly be lost as Im sure she won't be getting out of drug felony charges within a reasonable amount of time to be able to get back to work. Now with no job, car impounded, legal fees, still have all your other regular life bills that are going to back up quickly, a possible felony on her record and trying to get money for bail she's probably going to have to post &amp; this girls life is now ruined. \n\nAll for a victimless crime. She was not intoxicated. Cop said as much to her. That if it would have been rolled up joint or bowl she would have been allowed to receive a ticket and go home but because it was Vape cartridge he has to arrest her. \n\nI mean these types of things happen all the time and it ruins people. This one incident will follow this young girl for years. Debt, shame, criminal record... just trying to make it home on a Friday night and end up with felony drug charges .... smh",

I can 100% confirm our justice system is a complete joke.\n\nFirst case was a double homicide that happened 5 years ago (well 11 years ago now). This was his first actual trial for the murder. It took 5 YEARS just to get his actual jury trial. That's insane.\n\nWe are not, \"Innocent until proven guilty.\" That is an i absolute lie. Say I killed someone, and then they keep me in jail for 5 years before my trial. Then, after all of that time, I am found innocent. For those 5 years, I would've been an innocent man in jail. I am not rich, I wouldn't be able to afford bail. I assume most people are in that same boat as well.\n\nIf I am innocent before my proof of guilt, then I should NOT be in jail of any kind. It should be house arrest with an ankle bracelet. Hell, put a GPS chip in my neck I don't care. Anything would beat being in prison for 5 years for a crime that you haven't even been sentenced for yet.",

The Supreme Court set the limit at 7.5 g of the mind-altering ingredient in cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). But, ultimately, the states have the final say. While most allow for possession of up to 6 grams (0.2 ounces), some, like North-Rhine Westphalia allow for up to 10 grams. Berlin, a city-state, shows flexibility for up to 15 grams.\"",

Many people have bottom dysphoria which means they will never be happy unless they get the operation. I on the other hand, only experience some of that, and know the physical trauma of the surgery will not be worth it in the end. I'm choosing not to because, while there is provable dysphoria in MANY other places, that isn't one of them.\n\nAt the end of the day literally everyone in my life views me as a woman and the fact that I am perpetually pre-op doesn't change that fact.",

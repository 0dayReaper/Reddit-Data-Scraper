I feel for you, we felt stuck between not wanting to really hurt a kid and not wanting to get killed. They ended up tazing him. More than one grown man cried at the end of the call. Worst part is we never find out the aftermath or what happen to him.",

My friend's brother was restrained briefly by someone who claimed to be trained in restraining safely but was not actually knowledgeable at all on this and it did not help the situation at all.",

I needed a very clear and concise explanation for things so I could follow the logic path and understand why what happened happened.\n\nWhen you're in a negative situation that conflicts with that viewpoint and nobody will give you the proper stimulus of information to understand it it set's your mind off like alarm bells flooding your head. I'd honestly say meltdown is the best descriptor as it feel like the processor in your head just lit on fire.\n\nGetting in trouble for doing an activity that other kids were doing but aren't getting punished for and you don't understand what separates you from them was a common one for me. A neurotypical kid might brush past it and sift through the nuances or regulate their emotional response naturally but me? It was like reality just flipped and suddenly everyone was angry and I was suddenly incredibly isolated, like I'd just been ambushed.\nWithout a proper way of handling the conflicting information it would set me into fight or flight and the only natural outlet a child in that situation understands is physical or verbal hysteria. Hitting my head, physical aggression, yelling and crying, anything to get the feelings out and ask for help, that help being someone provide me the information I need to process the situation and calm me down.\n\nThe only issue is *nobody in this situation ever tries to help.* \n*Ever.*\nPeople would rather distance themselves to a meltdown than try to understand and isolate it and get the kid to calm down.\n\nSo you're alone, scared, and cut off from emotional and intellectual comfort and left to burn yourself out till you're cold and numb. Except meltdowns can take a long time to burn out.\nA scary amount of adults out there would rather resort to physical violence to shut up a kid experiencing a meltdown not realizing that all that does is terrify an already overwhelming mind and set them to nuclear levels of anxiety and it just makes the situation worse and last longer.\nI honestly admit they were some of the most traumatic situations I remember and I've lived through some pretty rough and traumatic situations.\n\n\nThe best thing you can do for a child in this situation in my experience is to calmy explain the situation in excruciating detail and comfort the child the best you can with a dialog. *NEVER* lose your nerves or resort to threats or violence. \"Giving them something to cry about\" will make them cry, not shut them up.",

I guess it\u2019s a good thing that child labor laws are being rolled back, so her kids will be forced to work dangerous jobs instead of be educated so they can recognize these issues. Not that the education is that good anyways, because if they WERE in school they wouldn\u2019t learn about anything important, they wouldn\u2019t learn about anyone that represents anything other than cishet white men, so all the kids that, god forbid, come out a little gay or trans just kill themselves and play further into this twisted rhetoric that politicians are building for the youth and future of America.",

I make $20 and I still can't afford a place either. Taxes take about 1/3 of my gross, so I take home around $2140 a month, but like you mentioned, rents around $1600, that other $500 can go realllllll quick considering electric, food, internet, gas, and the unexpected. The way I see it, I could have my own place and basically overwork to sustain it (essentially not having time to enjoy myself or the home I'm paying for) or live with my rents and actually have money to live and have some form of enjoyment. Unfortunately if you don't have a dual income household yous basically screwed; on the flip it's tough as you get older to meet people because we have a societal expectation for people to have their own homes and such even though it's nearly impossible",

You try to help them calm/soothe if you have been given tools/know the plan etc. Otherwise you contain them as best you can.\n\nNot to be rude, I mean this in an illustrative way.

He could have de-escalated the situation in many different ways that didnt involve any sort of manhandling or threat of pain, but he chose not to.\n\nYou can't say 'what else should he do', because doing literally nothing would have been better than what he did here.\nHe could have tried talking to the child in a calm and composed manner. He could have shown that he was a person the child could trust or feel safe with. He could have done a multitude of things.\nBut instead he chose to pick up the child, which is taking some form of control away from the child and is absolutely *not* what you should do when trying to solve a problem in situations like these. He chose to almost kick the child, which is not what you should do, since it reinforces the fact that 'this is not a safe place for you', which will do nothing but make the child's meltdown worse because they may feel like theyre in a place or surrounded by people who want to hurt the kid.\n\nWhat he *should* have done is literally the opposite of what he *actually* did",

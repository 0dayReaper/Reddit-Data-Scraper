I have a genetic mutation that causes vascular irregularities. I\u2019ve had a stroke, I have seizures, I lost the motor function in my hands from a lesion in my spinal cord, I have cognitive deficits from a lesion near the water space in my brain that was threatening to put me in a coma. So on the one hand I\u2019m pissed! I was healthy! I did everything right. I don\u2019t drink or smoke, I was really fit. Then on the other hand I think I wouldn\u2019t have survived any of this if I hadn\u2019t been healthy and strong. It\u2019s an interesting argument for nature vs nurture. Eventually nature will claim me (statistically within the next 12 years) but todays not the day. Unless I get hit by a truck.",

She was supposed to be babysitting his kids, she showed up but the kids and mother were gone, it was just creepo there. He coerced her into stripping and posing for pictures. I don't remember the specific threats he used to get her to do it and keep her mouth shut, but my grandparents didn't find out until a while later. It being the 50s, they never involved the police unfortunately, my grandpa just went over there with his brothers and beat the dude within an inch of his life.\n\nWho knows whatever became of the photos creepo took, for all I know there are copies still floating around out there somewhere.\n\nFound out about that at the same time I found out my dad and grandpa had each been molested by their Catholic priests when they were kids. Hell of a day.",

My dad was one of the few siblings who broke away as soon as he was able to and basically never went to church again. I know for a fact the sexual abuse he suffered in the church was a big part of that, because we spoke about it a few times.\n\nAs far as my grandpa, no one in the family knew about his abuse experiences until after he passed, except my grandma. She's the one who told my dad and his siblings about it later. So I don't know how he reconciled all that with himself, or why he was comfortable throwing all his kids into that same environment he'd been abused in, since he remained a very staunch Catholic right up til the day he died.",

It is almost like an obsession.\n\nFor illustration the crown prosecution service in England and Wales has a cut off at 1,000 images, the thinking there being that that forms enough criminal intent to prefer the charge.

If you have 200 different catalogs of girls swimwear it's a different context entirely.\n\nThis very much depends on your jurisdiction.\n\nIn Canada, those would be considered \"child collateral images.\" They're aggravating in context, but they don't meet the legal definition of child pornography. Similarly, images of a 16-17 year old while technically child porn may be considered too ambiguous to categorize as child pornography. The general rule is to only label the image as child pornography if it clearly meets that definition.\n\nSo...that means that this may legitimately be 200,000+ images of actual child sexual abuse material.",

For the small county I live in, this means that all of the cases have to go before the grand jury before they can go to trial.  So all we, the jury, did was listen to the evidence for the case and vote on if we thought they had enough evidence to go to trial.\n\nThere were several CSAM cases, and there was this woman who worked for the police, who's job it was to look at all the evidence and determine if it was an existing picture or if it was \"new\" so that they could try to find the victims / perpetrators.  It was hard enough for me to have to hear the descriptions of the material they found, I could imagine having to see those things day after day.",

Lived on a ward for 2 years and saw the best in people and the absolutes worst in people.\n\nParents desperately clinging to hope whilst friends make excuses and get bored of watching their childhood friend wither away. \n\nSpouses and partners often bear the brunt of it because they watch the person they love fall to pieces, but it\u2019s weird how often people capriciously change their mind and go down this road of self pity. One day they wake up and make up bullshit reasons as to why they shouldn\u2019t have to deal with it anymore. They suddenly see their lifelong companion as little more than an inconvenience, and resent them for having the attention. Some people can\u2019t handle not being in the spotlight.\n\nBut oh boy, when the funeral happens you bet your ass they\u2019ll all be there crying their eyes out and talking about how they miss them. Nothing but a bunch of grief thiefs. \n\nIf you want my opinion she\u2019s the _real_ cancer, and the illness probably did him a favour to get rid of her.",

I think that is the worst way to get dumped and a huge trauma!\nIt\u2019s both infuriating and tragic. And to use that as a way to gain sympathy after the fact is true narcissism!

Don't do anything in his memory or on his behalf, and doubly don't present yourself as a hero for it. You left, you told everyone you couldn't deal with it, you made your bed and now you have to lie in it.

I think they probably struggle because seeing someone dying reminds them they have a limited time too, and the same could happen to them. That and not everyone knows how to be supportive beyond saying \"get well soon\" when someone is sick. They recognize that if someone is dying that would be ridiculous to say but also don't feel comfortable saying \"I'm sorry you are dying, is there anything I can do?\"",

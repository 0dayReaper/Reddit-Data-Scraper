This pain can manifest in different ways, such as anger, resentment, and mistrust, and it can make them feel vulnerable and powerless. To regain a sense of control, some hurt individuals may resort to lashing out or manipulating others, even if it causes harm or perpetuates a cycle of violence.\n\nFurthermore, hurt individuals may also lack healthy coping mechanisms or social support, which can contribute to their negative behaviors. They may not have learned effective communication skills or problem-solving strategies, or they may have been exposed to dysfunctional relationships or harmful role models. As a result, they may struggle to manage their emotions and relationships, and may inadvertently inflict their pain on others.\n\nIt's important to note that while understanding the reasons behind hurtful behaviors can be helpful, it's not an excuse for people to continue harming others. Ultimately, everyone is responsible for their actions, and it's up to each individual to seek help and work on healing their own emotional wounds.\n\nYou\u2019re not anything special if you don\u2019t hurt others. You\u2019re just something less if you do\u2026\n-me",

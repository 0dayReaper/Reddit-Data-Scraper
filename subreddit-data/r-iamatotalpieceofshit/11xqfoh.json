He has a fake license plate but i got him to give me a photo his (expired ) id. The police arrived Four hours late. he left after the first two hours but I had everything on my  cam plus photos of his ID and the damage. Everything.  they told me that they couldn\u2019t do anything about it? I would have to hire a private detective, prove that he had an income to pay the 2,000 in damages and then take him to court.. \n\nI googled that man and it turns out that he was a sexual predator . Good thing I\u2019m a 4\u201911 woman or being left alone with a serial rapist would be terrifying\u2026 oh wait! Thanks police for doing nothing.",

Farmers couldn't afford to insure their vehicles or pay taxes on their lands and they were especially swayed by these arguments.   \n\nOne of the most effective and prolific spreaders of this concept was a guy named Winston Shrout, who was eventually banned from Commonwealth nations like the U.K. , Canada, NZ and AUS.

Years ago I parked my car on a 5th floor parking garage and parked my car in a corner where it would *almost* be impossible to hit my car. Yet, still someone managed to rear end my car. It probably was a car parked across mine and they backed up and turned their wheel into it, cause of the angle. They left me a note apologizing for hitting it, and said they\u2019d pay for it to be fixed.\n\nI messed them, let them know I\u2019d get a quote, they agreed and when it was like $2000, they ghosted me. Even though the cops had a name, number, and written letter they wouldn\u2019t do anything because it was on a private property (museum parking garage). It was civil and I would have to take them to court. \n\nThis car looks like a brand new Lexus and by the looks of it that\u2019s probably easily $5K-8K in damage.

I am guessing that was a manslaughter case so garnered more attention. But he was looking for someone of a completely different description and the model was a hatchback while mine was a sedan. Since then I've learned it was unwise of me to even talk to them, but I had the naivety of innocence. The cop actually showed me a grainy picture of the suspect. Always wondered if they ever found him.",

If they want to drive to my house and see the make and model of my car, they know where I live. If they want to see what I look like they can come knock on my door and if I choose to open it, I will.\n\nBut coming in for questioning is never wise, even when you're innocent. You may stumble into saying something that gives them cause to hold you. It happens to completely innocent people every day. If they have evidence, they will arrest you and you should ask for a lawyer. If they don't have evidence, they have absolutely zero legal power to make you answer questions, and you should still get a lawyer.\n\nSome people think lawyering up makes them look guilty. This is a fallacy. Getting someone who understands the law and knows your rights better than you do is always wise. And most lawyers would tell you to never volunteer to be interrogated - even if you're completely innocent. You are very likely to be manipulated into saying something you don't fully understand the repercussions of. Police are allowed to lie and prosecutors can cherry pick which part of an interrogation they want to show to a jury.",

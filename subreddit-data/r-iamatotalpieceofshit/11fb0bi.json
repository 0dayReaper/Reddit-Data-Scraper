It's just a pipe that slides inside another pipe and there are multitudes of blueprints and videos online that'll teach ya.\n\nPoint B: America isn't some tiny country that you can just pass a law and suddenly every gun is gone or rounded up. What we really need is better mental health care and less single parent households. As for the ammunition, this is America, where there's a will there's a way. \n\nPoint c: shinzo Abe's assassination.",

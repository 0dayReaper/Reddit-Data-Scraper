I don't care how big they are. Police dogs have no capacity to be intimidated, or fear for their lives. That's what impresses me so much, if you are their target there's nothing you can do. They're coming at you full blast and there's nothing you can do to scare them away.\n\nNot relating that to this video in any way, I have no idea how or why this dog was released, but mannnn add it to the pile of videos that remind me how scary a well trained dog can be",

These dogs live for the bite, it's all they want, so once they get it, especially if the suspect riled it up before the video, they're biting down with a force most people wouldn't have the strength to pull apart. The straddling he's doing is the best and really only way to get them to stop in this situation, but these dogs have a bite force stronger than you could imagine. Different handler wouldn't make a difference I guarantee you.",

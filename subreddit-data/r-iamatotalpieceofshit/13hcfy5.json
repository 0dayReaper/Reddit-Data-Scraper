I'm not saying I don't think those involved aren't utter bastards (those who weren't there should be put down as publicly unreliable and liars), but it's pretty scary how people recall even seemingly clear events in very different and changeable ways. Add the two together and that guy is dam lucky he had dash cam.",

Don\u2019t have kids yet myself, but I\u2019ve got several nieces and nephews and whenever we\u2019re out together and their parents aren\u2019t there, I always make sure to keep my eye on them at all times.

You can turn your back for 1 second and that\u2019s all it takes. \n\nThe dad just witnessed his kid getting hit by a car. Did he react poorly, yes, but he was reacting to an incredible stressful situation. I don\u2019t see him as a villain in this case depending on how he reacted following the incident which this video doesn\u2019t give info on. \n\nThe villain is the person who lied to the police. Whether it was for attention or to try and push that agenda to make their street safer. Either way, they lied and I wish they would have put them in the spotlight in this more.",

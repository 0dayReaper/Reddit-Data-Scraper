She also suffered from sleep apnea, which interfered with sleep- thus she had mood swings. The school was also aware of this! So wrong. She is 8 now (i think) and has major ptsd and night terrors from this one incident.",

Now I\u2019m depressed AND I get to wake up to another headline that reads \u201c# of children have been slaughtered today.\u201d A little later in the day there will be a newsreel where an inept representative remains intent on doing absolutely nothing. They\u2019re not moved the slightest even though it\u2019s happening so frequently.\n\nI\u2019m nervous for my friends and family who have children. I\u2019m nervous for their children. I don\u2019t know why more American parents aren\u2019t outraged by this. How aren\u2019t we storming the capitol over this?! I feel like of all the things we should be advocating for is being tossed aside like it means nothing.\n\nI\u2019m nervous to the point that I can\u2019t even fathom the idea of bringing a child into this world. Why do we let these 2nd Amendment slinging nut jobs get away with being openly against stricter gun control? Why are we doing nothing? Why can\u2019t we agree that something has to happen to mitigate the horror children have to experience on a daily basis? Surely that\u2019s much more important than some whacko who is still living like they\u2019re in the 1700s?!\n\nI do know the answers to some of these questions. I just don\u2019t want to accept any of the answers because it makes me feel so hopeless. I just want to wake up from this nightmare. I\u2019m sure many more Americans do too. Sadly, I don\u2019t expect any relief to come our way anytime soon.",

No. Do I think this kind of thing likely happens far more than we think it does? Absolutely.  \n\nThis officer didn't come to just arrest this kid out of the blue. He had to have been dispatched there. There was also a second arresting officer. There was no fuss or investigation they walked in and did the perp walk. The officer also stated \"we are gonna take you to your mom\" during the arrest. \n\nWhat was the dispatch code? Why did the officer walk in knowing he was going to pick her up? Why didn't the other officer intervene? It seems that it was expected of him to arrest her... not that this was some kind of highly unusual event. \n\nI'd like to know more about department policies and norms as well as what the school CALLED THE POLICE FOR in the first place. \n\nMy main thing is... it didn't start at this officer.",

There probably is a policy.  But I don't want anyone who's actually comfortable with doing this being on the force any longer, and of course if there is such a policy it should be thrown out.  It was this or any other officer's duty to object, and if they couldn't be bothered, they don't deserve to work in law enforcement any more.  Arresting a six year old - absolutely pathetic, an embarrassment to the profession.  They're disgraceful, policy or not.",

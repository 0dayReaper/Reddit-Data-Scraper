                    "comment": "Hello, former private jet captain here. Most PJ charters from MIA to LAX range from 50-200k, so he most likely didn\u2019t WANT to afford it. Also, they have to abide by the FARs requiring all passengers and crew members to fasten their seatbelts. So he could be kicked off a private jet charter for unwillingness to fasten his seatbelt and not complying with crew member instructions under FAR 91.3, and he could potentially be blacklisted from that company and other companies by being placed on a no-fly list. I see he makes approximately 11 million in his contract, so this would be a substantial fraction of his annual income. There\u2019s rich, then there is private jet rich. Can\u2019t speak to his net worth but he doesn\u2019t seem to qualify.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the award!",

It takes some serious crime to get you out of the league if you're a star and being a dick on a plane generally isn't enough.",

Hilarious dude. \n\nBut he was hella chill and fielded questions from everyone, just seemed like a normal guy and was humble, just BSing with everyone and joking around. Wasn't the best COD player but played respectably hah. \n\nLater I saw some interviews with him and he seemed pretty down to earth off the field. Extremely hard worker and literally lived at the stadium for like his first year on the Bengals. \n\nAnyways, I just wanted sprinkle in some positivity on his name because he doesn't deserve the 'diva' label that TO or OBJ deserves. And I say that as a fan of TO.",

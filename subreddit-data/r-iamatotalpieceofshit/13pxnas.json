In my area the kids wouldn't even get the chance to do this because they engineer around it and take the animals away directly after the showing. Part of what they are learning is to care for the animal without getting attached as that is what farmers have to do.\n\nEdit- I'd also like to add that the fault here lies with the parents.

The appropriate local law enforcement mechanism, usually sheriffs, are the ones to do the seizing. In other words due process and proper procedure were not followed.

The thing is, the kid didn't want the goat killed, the parents backed up the kid and contacted the buyer, who was a state senator, who agreed to let the kid keep the goat.  The 4H people decided they had the right to send the police in to kill the kids goat.  Clearly, the 4H club wasn't the right organization for this kid, which they probably figured out when they had to contact the buyer to save the kid's pet.  But that really does not give the 4H club the right to traumatize this kid by killing her pet.  It's an organization set up to help kids learn to farm and this kid learned farming wasn't for her.  That lesson should be respected if the parents support it, which they did.",

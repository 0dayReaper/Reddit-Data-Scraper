He always talks about how government should basically only exist to defend the national interest. I mentioned that to build the wall, they would have to seize a significant amount of land from American citizens. He said that was fine, despite how fucking problematic THAT is. I pointed out that it would require a large enough government to seize the land and then defend that seizure in court and then enforce the seizure, through violence if necessary. That when he wants a small government and when he doesn't seems to be when it's convenient for him. He didn't really have a response to that.",

Also believe it or not No charges were ever even filed... I skimmed the article but it said due to the expiration of statute of limitations. I don\u2019t know why or what took so long for this to be able to happen. This is making me so angry bc there is no reason this situation should have \u201ctimed out\u201d ...

While sleep walking, I was fighting in my nightmare, and woke up to my screaming significant other asking why I was hitting her. I honestly don't recall any of what happened, only what I was dreaming and what I woke up to. She was holding my daughter and when I snapped awake I just was in shock and simply walked outside and sat and waited for the cops to come, said nothing, did nothing, didn't argue, just sat and hated myself. I had never touched a woman in my life and had vowed not to after growing up in an abusive environment and having a mother and grandmother who were beat. I grew up fighting my half sisters dad a lot because of his drunken actions amongst much more. While I have accepted I did it, I don't think I'll ever actually fully forgive myself, even though she has. We are still together, my daughter is 2 and my son is 7, and we are doing well. I am not that person but it really sucked to be treated as one by the cops when they came. I was thrown in a cell by myself, left to sleep on the ground without even a blanket, and stayed in a homeless shelter for a while afterwards.

Public defenders are heroes with thankless jobs. Overworked and underpaid.\n\nThere is a common misconception that defense attorneys are supposed to get their clients off. This leads to people disliking them (see Hillary defending a pedo as a lawyer). A defense attorney's job is to make sure that their client's rights are observed and that they aren't railroaded by the state. Whether they are guilty is irrelevant. Every single American is promised these rights and if they aren't defended they will disappear.\n\nIn my opinion, defending and protecting the rights of even the worst and most evil scumbags is a noble pursuit and one of the most patriotic things you can do for your country.",

Punishing them for using force would set a bad precedent where they may be more afraid of being prosecuted in the future than they would be for letting a criminal escape. That isnt terrible logic if, say, the person they beat to death had been shooting at them or attacking them with a knife. In that case, yes, defend yourself at all costs. But that man had not been violent when the 911 call came in. He was reported to be a homeless man that was wandering around confused and peering into cars. The police detained him on the sidewalk, but he wasnt completely coherent (due to his unmedicated schizophrenia) and wasnt responding how they liked. They then beat him with fists and batons for 9 minutes and tazed him twice in the face. Through all this he repeatedly screamed he was sorry, over and over again. He begged for 'daddy' multiple times, and yet the police continued beating him. There was no self defense there. He was no threat to anyone. The legal system failed that man, and it failed every citizen of that city. It was justice department sanctioned murder, and nothing less.",

These criminal cops should be in prison for life though. This is one case where hate of cops and the police administration backing them is wholly justified.",

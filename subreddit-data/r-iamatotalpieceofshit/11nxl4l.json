German Shepherds are so loyal, that was the most awful thing he could do to that dog. \nMy best dog ever was a Shepherd who I think got dumped in much the same way. I took him in when he showed up all skinny and sad at the barn where I rode a horse. For weeks after he first joined my household when we went on walks he would try to jump into any open car door (which surprised the hell out of the occupants of the vehicle) - I think he was still looking for a way back to his people.",

If it was an aggressive animal it probably wouldn't have been so relaxed about being thrown out of the car into a strange environment. This seems like someone was fed up because the dog was tearing up their stuff because they never trained/exercised the animal. Plus its a very sought after breed. Could have advertised it for free and it would've been gone in hours.\n\nI don't even like dogs, but I hate people who just abandon an animal. I've had to deal with people dumping animals at my farm far too many times and it never took more than a week to find someone willing to take them. Peak selfishness 100%.",

I truly hope this somehow makes , at least some of theses people, rethink their decision!  Animals, dogs in particular, look up to their owners, they rely on them, they give UNCONDITIONAL love.  Seeing that dog chase his owner\u2019s car is not easy to watch, it truly breaks my heart! The dog clearly had some type of connection to this person, just thinking about the anxiety and fear this poor dog must have felt seeing its owner drive away is heart-breaking. Those who have experienced the loss of a pet known how devastating and painful it can be, it is un fathomable to think these people are purposely trying to \u201close\u201d theirs.",

A woman brought in a beagle puppy in a kennel that was too small and the puppy was whimpering. The employee at the shelter was passive aggressive. She asked the woman a series of questions about why the woman didn\u2019t \u2014 call the breeder to take the dog back, call a rescue group or try a trainer. This shelter requires people to make an appointment to surrender animals. This woman had made an appointment. She then told the woman the shelter would not take the puppy. All of the time the puppy was stressed and whimpering. The employee did everything she could to humiliate the woman for surrendering the puppy. The woman finally told her, she was going to dump the puppy. \n    So let\u2019s stop with \u201cyou can just drop a dog off at a shelter without any problem\u201d and \u201cwhy don\u2019t people go to a shelter\u201d? People do this because shelter employees humiliate you for surrendering a pet.",

We do have other farm cats, but they weren't accepting of him and if he couldn't get in their shelter with a heat lamp, he'd probably freeze to death. \n\nHis tenacity was amazing. He knew he was on his own and started coming by my place hoping for some dinner scraps here and there. He wouldn't leave. Then I'd let him in the garage on particularly cold nights. Then eventually I just said screw it and said, 'come inside, you're a housecat now'. \n\nI was pretty worried about how he would adapt and what kind of trouble he would get into, but he's the sweetest, most grateful cat I've ever seen. He loves that he has his own food at a regular schedule and isn't even interested in people food or what I'm eating. He doesn't eat his food all at once, he likes multiple little snacks throughout the day/night cuz I'm sure he remembers what it's like having no food. \n\nHis favorite toy is still the first toy I gave him and it isn't anything more than an old sock filled with some cardboard toilet paper rolls and tied off at the end. He's always used his litterbox and never went anywhere else (which makes me think he had one in his old life) and that makes it worse, because at one point he was probably warm and cared for and then like flipping a switch, outside, lost, in the middle of winter. \n\nIt's been fun introducing him to new toys, catnip, a brush, and nail clippers. He loves it all. I've even stopped buying the farm-supply store bulk cat food and get him the good brand name stuff. (no idea if there's a big difference, but the last half of his life is gonna be a hell of a lot more comfortable than the first half.",

The idea I was trying to convey is that it is cowardly to cause an animal to die slowly and painfully in order to spare yourself the sight and experience of killing it quickly. Certainly caring for or finding a suitable home for the unwanted animal is the right thing to do. However, in my experience (I live near a state forest where MANY dogs get dumped) domestic animals abandoned in the wild come to miserable ends. If you\u2019re going to condemn an animal to death (which abandoning a pet essentially is), the least you can do is make it quick.\n\nEdit: it might also be reasonable to posit that questioning this fellow\u2019s masculinity in conjunction with this behavior is an effective way to scold him for it, but idk cause idk the dude. I\u2019d be curious what y\u2019all think of that position.",

If that is all you are giving them, they would 1000% rather be home with you for 3-4 good days, and say good bye with you there than be in the ICU going through treatments for the time they have left. Focus on good quality of life, not quantity. Ask for sub Q fluids and steroids if the vet thinks it will help them be comfortable, and aporpreate pain killers(this should all only be a few hundred dollars, if that), and give them the best last few days they have a chance of. \n\nYour love for your pet isn't measured in how long you can keep them alive at the end. Stay with them during euthanasia- so many people leave them with us, it never feels right.\n\nIf your dog is young and otherwise healthy and could have many years of life, its a different calculation. (I say this as someone who gave up my honeymoon to have my dog's bladder stones removed- we got 5 more years with him.)",

Opened window and our pup was super excited thinking mommy picking him up.\n\nNote we were on our way home too.\n\nWife said bye and drive off, again same direction towards home (we are like at the end of the street), my pup was tipping crying whining pulling the leash until he was choking himself.  Since our street is safe and most people off leash their dogs here I unleashed him after wife parked the car (else im afraid the pup would charge the car and gets run over accidentally). He dashed at light speed to my wife and since then he has this abandonment issue whenever my wife says bye.\n\nI cannot imagine someone abandoning their dog like this.  Seeing my pup that day made me, a grown ass man, almost want to cry.  \n\nWe don't deserve dogs, I tell you.",

And instead he died of cancer. I'm still not over it completely, and if I let myself hold his ashes I can still start to cry. \n\nI'm not sure what to do with them. They are in a nice carved and sealed wooden box and I know some people scatter them or bury them. But I do find comfort that his ashes are in his favorite spot in the home.

Police are still searching for the man in the video. \n\n&gt; Dowdy Ferry Animal Commission founder Jeremy Boss says the area where the dog was dumped is between two major highways. The commission is a rescue group which monitors that area and says dozens of dogs, both alive and dead, are left there every month.\n\n&gt; Abandoning a pet is a Class A misdemeanor.\n\n&gt; Boss has petitioned the Dallas Council to increase Police patrols in the area and make stiff fines for suspects. Abandoning your pet is a criminal offense. You can get a misdemeanor or a felony for it. \n\n&gt; Boss says the German Sheppard in the video is not up for adoption yet, but there is already a long list of people wanting to give him a forever home\n\nNot linking article just in case it violates rule 5.\n\n\nEDIT: indecent to incident.

It was early January and she was a young puppy, so we figure she was probably an unwanted Christmas gift. There was a blizzard that night, so she would have perished for sure if she hadn't found us. I'm so glad I went for a walk that night.",

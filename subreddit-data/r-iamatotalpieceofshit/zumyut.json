Children with disabilities should never be excluded from activities for their disabilities. I work with children a lot and in child care services I\u2019ve had plenty of children with emotional, mental and physical disabilities. It\u2019s so easy to explain to other kids why we have to modify play time to work with them.\n\nHell I\u2019ve had kids in a 4 hour drop off care who were never gonna see each other again be the most understanding towards children with very obvious disabilities. If you just tell them that our friend needs help being included in the group, or may need to sit apart at certain times to feel calmer during craft time they completely get it and support that kid. Children are inherently good. When you show them how to make someone feel good they will do it. \n\nThis teacher visibly excluding this girl during a major event is gonna show kids that she can\u2019t participate because she\u2019s different. This is heartbreaking. This is why kids grow up and bully kids with differences, it\u2019s because adults point them out at a young age.",

And bare in mind, this is just what the teacher does in public, when *all* of the classes parents (maybe even families) are watching. I\u2019m willing to bet the teacher does worse in the classroom, when nobody who could stop her is around. What other abuse has that kid faced? What other activities is she excluded from? Is there a bias against her in terms of how her schoolwork is graded or what social/educational standards she is held too? \n\nNevermind what this kind of treatment will do to her relationships with her peer group, and how they will possibly treat her based upon this poor leadership. \n\nHonestly I don\u2019t want to think about how much I would be tempted to hurt anyone if they did anything like this to a child in my care.",

I was just confused a lot, seemed younger than my peers, didn't learn group activities as fast as others, etc. There was nothing wrong with me \"academically\" but I was left out of a lot of activities because I couldn't do them properly. I got frost bite on my toes when I was 7 because the teacher left me standing on the side of the ice skating rink for over an hour in my ice skates, while the others played games. I couldn't skate, so I was just left there on my own like I didn't matter. Same with a lot of things, but that one still bothers me to this day.\n\nI may or may not have ADD.\n\nEven if the kid has developmental issues or sensory issues, most of the time it still hurts to be an outsider.",

He doesn't sing, shall we say... melodiously, but with *enthusiasm*!  I take my choir to contests and festivals, and my man \"J\" is front and center.  \n\nJudges never ever penalize us for his lack of tone, blend, pitch, rhythm, or musicality.  They appreciate our inclusion, and just accept that my man \"J\" is part of the group.  We score what we're supposed to score, every time, not lower, not higher.  The judges get it. The instructor in this video clearly doesn't.\n\nWe performed the *Hallelujah Chorus* this winter with my Band and Choir combined. Once in a lifetime opportunity for my student musicians.  My man \"J\" wasn't terribly accurate in his personal performance, but goddammit, he's one of my 80 musicians.  It'll be a cold day in Hell before I go excluding him from that experience. My admin, audience, and other musicians get it.   The instructor in this video clearly doesn't.\n\nMy man \"J\" has a good shot to be the Wizard in our production of Wizard of Oz this spring, because damn, he's fun to watch.  Or he might be a different role, mayor of Munchkintown, something.  He doesn't memorize lines spectacularly well, but he's a friggin entertainer.  And I'm not putting on a Kennedy Center concert or Broadway production.  Just a quality school show.  My actors and theatre audience get it.  The instructor in this video clearly doesn't.\n\nSo I don't know where this teacher gets off, not even letting the girl be in the circle holding hands.  It's not like the artistic integrity was gonna be compromised.\n\nIncluding kiddos with special needs or different mobilities/abilities is not hard, man.  This teacher is clueless, and opening themself up to a lot of questions from the office of civil rights.",

Teachers can be as formatively relevant to children as their own parents and teachers like you quite literally save lives. Bless you.",

Most of our vocalists are students who access special needs supports, and they sound a lot like your man J; full of enthusiasm to be a part of the group. I work with the vocalists to help them learn lyrics and time cues. They may not be on key, but they sure do bring the joy. Music is for everyone.",

We had a girl with Downs Syndrome who signed up for choir and our coach made sure she was as included in our performances as the rest of us; even though she sang off-key, she always sang with heart.",

He would love nothing more than to be around your class. He can't sing but he can enjoy music like no person I know.\nThis video broke my heart because I can only imagine what that little girl's parents were feeling while watching her being ignored. Our special little ones just want to be included and treated like everyone else.\nAs a parent, I would love all of my son's teachers to be just like you.

I am 65 years old, but I started losing the use of my legs 15 years ago and I will need to use this chair for the rest of my life.  Most people don't know how to act around people in wheelchairs.  My husband and I don't get invited to things because I guess people figure that too many \"arrangements\" have to be made to accommodate me, and I overheard someone talking to a person who was planning a gathering that they didn't want to invite us because everyone was supposed to bring something, and they were afraid that whatever we brought wasn't going to be \"up to par because they never have any money\".  It just really hurt, because no, we DON'T have money, my husband hasn't been able to work for 3 years because he had 4 heart attacks, we haven't been able to buy Christmas or birthday gifts since he got sick, but the fact that we are together means more to us than anything so their stupidity hurts, but at least we have each other.  This poor little one has to go socialize with these kids and this boorish teacher every day.  I can't imagine how she must have felt!  It's hard enough for me to deal with it, but a little kid?  That teacher should have no happiness this year.",

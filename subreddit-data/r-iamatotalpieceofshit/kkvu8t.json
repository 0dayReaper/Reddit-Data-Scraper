Public walking in and out all the time, obviously a higher risk environment. Face Shield Lady didn't seem to mind.

The only thing they\u2019re restricting is on is no vented masks. No one gets tested here unless they\u2019re suspected of having covid and they\u2019re put on leave. There are definitely no cameras here as well (something about being a security risk. We\u2019re not even supposed to have our phones on us).\n\nWe\u2019re doing our best with what we\u2019ve been given, and thankfully no one\u2019s tested positive yet. This is a state with one of the lowest covid rates though, so I think that has a little to do with our lack of cases at my facility.",

There is a contract with our union, but the rules are different depending on if you\u2019re career or non-career. Anyone coming in off the street starts as non-career and then has to wait for a career position to become available. Supposedly I\u2019m going to be converted to career by March though, so the end is in sight for me, and I can finally work a few 40 hour weeks and then pick up overtime on my own terms. I am currently an MHA (mail handler assistant), and what I do is mostly sorting parcels and help run the parcel sorting machines. \n\nRight now, because of liberal leave policies in effect until January they can\u2019t do much to people calling out. There are a few people who came in after me who called out a lot because of the insane hours, and at their 90 day review were terminated. That being said, they called out enough to be working under 40 hours per week which means they were taking up a position without doing the work.",

Flu, strep, pink eye.  \n\nNOTHING ELSE was considered an acceptable reason to not be in school, and they wanted a doctor's note to verify you had the flu and didn't just think you might.  \n\nthen I remember at my first job where if you wanted to call in sick from work and not get in trouble you had to, yourself, go find another employee who would agree to take your shift.  So many people came to work sick at that store, that I almost quit because one winter I spent over 20% of the money I made working at the store over those 3 months on doctor's visits and medicine.  I didn't show up when sick.  Ever.",

You can't claim \"oh, it didn't cross my mind\" when the WORLD is upside down during a global pandemic, where it's constantly in the news and talked about on social media and on people's minds daily.\n\nNow, I don't claim your aunt really wants or hopes to give the disease to others, but she might as well have that mindset, as the result is the same.\n\nIt's the legal distinction between \"murder\" and \"manslaughter\", the latter being analogous to your aunt's behavior:\n\n&gt; The difference between manslaughter and murder lies in the intention of the killer. In a manslaughter, the killer has no intention to kill the other person but it so happened, on the other hand, in a murder a killer has that intention of killing another person. These two words, murder and manslaughter, are used interchangeably by a layman. However, forensics defines the two as being distinct. \n\n[Source](https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-manslaughter-and-murder/)\n\nTo be perfectly clear, I'm not saying your aunt has committed manslaughter, it's an analogy for her behavior. And if anyone dies she has spread it to, then I'm personally of the opinion she is guilty of manslaughter, but IANAL and my opinion doesn't matter anyway.",

Literally did not step foot outside my house other than to take out the trash and I did that at midnight when no one was around.. I would get all my groceries delivered and Clorox all my packages, counter, everything I touched, etc. I did this because i am cautious and take civic duty seriously, but also because there was so much unknown about the virus at that point.\n\nNow new information has been discoverd, the most important being that touch transmission and outdoor transmission with an N95 mask on is unheard of. Now I walk my dog every day for both of our sanities, i wear an N95 and i keep my distance best i can, but i live in a conservative area with high foot traffic, so i usually pass by at least 50-75 maskless people each walk bare minimum. Been doing that for 7 months and so far I've stayed negative. I even support local restaurants by ordering take out food and wiping everything for caution, even though i have confidence i would be fine even not wiping.\n\n If you have an n95 on and are outside the likelihood of getting it is extremely low. So please for your own sake, and so you don't develop agoraphobic and nosophobic tendencies, take a walk every day. You will be shocked how much it lifts your spirits.",

It's sad. So very sad.",

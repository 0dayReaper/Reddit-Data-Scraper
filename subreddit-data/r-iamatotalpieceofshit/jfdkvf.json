I'd close them on sight until they replaced them, and then do random checks to verify they don't put that shit back up.\n\nEdit add: I appreciate people asking me to go do just this, but I am not an employee of the Orange County Department of Environmental Health. I have zero authority in that county. I do not know anyone in that county. The nearest inspector I know is in LA, and he has zero authority in OC.\n\nI could make an anonymous complaint directly to the department...but so can literally anyone else. I love that everyone wants this to be enforced--and so do I--but you also must go through the proper channels. If you have seen a restaurant/food truck/caterer going against local or state ordinances then put in a complaint to the local health authority, or multiple if they apply (environmental health, public health, etc.).\n\nEven if I *could* go to OC and had authority, I would still have to witness all of this myself to do anything. Otherwise it's hearsay.",

Wasn't trying to get rich or anything crazy. Got traumatized when his friend ~~died~~  *murdered a kid for stealing his bike* and realized he needed to change. Just wanted to become a soldier and cop, get by and maybe do good. Felt like the actor really got better too.\n\n I was just more invested in his shit at that point than Lip/Fiona shitting away another opportunity for booze/dick.",

Like sure watching a show about a bunch of people with rough lives do crazy and dramatic things is fun, but if you also characterize them as people just trying to improve themselves but then also never let them learn from their mistakes then it gets exhausting to keep caring about the characters. Like at least in shows like It\u2019s Always Sunny it\u2019s clear that their end goal isn\u2019t to improve their lives and learn from their mistakes. There\u2019s not supposed to be any seasonal story arch where they grow as people, they\u2019re just supposed to be terrible people that do ridiculous things to fulfill their greed and narcissism. Same also applies to Trailer Park Boys. \n\nSame reason why I couldn\u2019t get into the show \u201cBallers\u201d. It felt like each step forward came with two steps back. Let them succeed and maintain the success. You can still create conflicts that challenge them, but under new circumstances. Writers spend so much time getting their audience invested in their character\u2019s success just to never let them achieve it.",

Orange County is full of non-masking individuals and it is sad to see restaurants like these doing what they do. The sad part is, the county (including other counties) refuse to enforce anything. So shit like this happens more and more, and become more blatant as time goes on. Californians wonder why their numbers still increase.\n\nLet us not forget they also held a several hundred crowd church event here without masks. OC is a beautiful county, but filled with very very dumb people.",

So they probably got kicked from the platform or Toasttab put them on hold.\n\nEdit 3: I'm genuinely offended by how shitty their chicken parmesan looks and it's $19... That's some Olive Garden shit.",

If someone was disabled and it was something that puts them at risk for covid, demanding that they REMOVE their mask is a violation of ADA because the in no way impacts the business in any significant way.  This is exactly what a reasonable accommodation is.  They should be reported.",

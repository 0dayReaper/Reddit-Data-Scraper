She was found alive and well, and a man has been arrested, still not public who he is - but on certain Danish subreddits they share his name and what they know..\n\nSP you could argue, that in modern society, this policy may have an opposite effect in some aspects.",

But from what i can make out he says \"Hva s\u00e5, hva s\u00e5, hvad vil du, hva s\u00e5\" (What's up, what's up, what do u want, what's up) which is honestly just what we say when we're about to enter a fight here in Denmark. I kid you not. Every single fight I've ever witnessed here, this has been what was said prio. There are the odd things people throw in sometimes but mainly It's just \"hva s\u00e5\" and \"hvad vil du\".\n\nEdit: Id like to add to this, drunk/drugged out people standing and shouting are quite a frequent spawn in the metros. And sometimes just on the street. The most standard thing to do is just ignore him and try to not initiate any form of contact. At the start of the video the guy is telling drunk/drugged shouter to behave, and at that point you basically have to be ready to fight.",

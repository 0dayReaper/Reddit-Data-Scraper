Issues that make school harder but certainly do not prevent someone, especially at 17, knowing the difference between right and wrong, knowing that this isn't ok.\n\nI have no idea what the nature of his special needs are, just throwing it out there that it may be something like that.  My stepdaughter is classified as special needs and has and IEP and for her it's just ADHD.  And she has had teacher's aids assigned to her.",

So many businesses (including plenty of small businesses) have been hit hard by brazen theft and some of them have been forced to close.  The thieves fear nothing knowing nobody will bother to arrest them most of the time and if they do get arrested it's just a slap on the wrist.  I don't agree with locking people up in huge numbers but some people need to face consequences.  Especially someone that breaks into a school to stab a fucking tortoise.  Anyone that would hurt a tortoise just for fun has done much worse things or they will eventually.",

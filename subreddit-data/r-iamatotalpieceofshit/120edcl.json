I informed them that coming in unannounced might get them shot and they told me they gave us 24 hours notice. Funny because I got off work at 11 P.M. and no notice on my door. Yet after they left I see a notice on my doorknob. Point being never trust strangers coming in to be good or honest. I have no idea what they were actually doing there and it scares me to think what they may have intended to do.",

Your brain takes control just like flight/fight and does what it can to preserve your physical and mental wellbeing. It's a form of disassociation.   \n\n\nShe is disabled, so flight wasn't an option. Even for a non disabled person, running away in that situation could have the same result as getting angry (fight) - which could have gotten her raped or killed (or both). Also it's not easy to run away when you're in that position. Even if you could sprint to the door, unlocking and opening it takes time.\n\nI'm a survivor of abuse and SA and I felt myself fawning just watching that video. \n\nThe video cuts out the first part of what he says. He says \"I could screw you right now\". She replies \"I don't want you to screw me\", and that's when this video begins. The original video with the \"I could screw you right now\" was deleted but there is at least one stitch with it on tiktok.",

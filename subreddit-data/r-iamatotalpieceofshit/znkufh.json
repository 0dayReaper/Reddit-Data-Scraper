And even then, it would shoot down (a simple trip to porn hub will confirm this, it doesnt work out how you think it does especially considering she is projecting it so far) As a guy, I would need to bend my junk between my legs to do what she is doing, and our urethras are roughly coming out at the same point... so unless she has a dick, she is projectile shitting.\n\nEdit:on further \"research\", I found one woman who was peeing backwards in the doggystyle position. However, she essentially had to bend with he face all the way to the tub floor in order to achieve the feat.\n\nYes, knowing the answer to this is very important to me for some reason. \ud83e\udd23",

This is either a) a penis b) an item like a You Go Girl that works like a funnel  or c) fake. \n\nIf people without penises could do this, we would be doing it at camp sites and the side of the road. We wouldn\u2019t squat over gross toilets in bars. We wouldn\u2019t risk getting it on shoes when there are no public restrooms. This is not physically possible. If you would like to prove me wrong, please stand in front of your toilet, bend over, and tell me how it goes. But I strongly suggest bringing some paper towels with you.",

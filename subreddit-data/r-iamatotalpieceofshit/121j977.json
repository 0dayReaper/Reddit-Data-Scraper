It\u2019s hard to collect information and prosecute criminals, especially when you have constitutional rights of others to consider. \n\n&gt;\t if I only completed 40% of my work I would be fired, same with most of us.\n\nYou realize this is an absurd statement right. Maybe if you didn\u2019t know the identities of the people you had to talk to, and you only had little information to go on, then you would only get 40% done.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not saying the police are great, but there are 2 issues with this statement. \n\n1.\tIt undersells the police and gives people the impression that crime is easy to get away with. In reality the police catch a lot of people and put them through the system. \n\n2.\tcrime is hard to solve, it\u2019s not necessarily incompetence that leads to the number you cited \n\n&gt;\tThat\u2019s not even getting into where they got it wrong and the wrong person went to jail, because there\u2019s a solid percentage of that in that 40%\n\nThat number is closer to 5% which is still way too high. But I think you need to think more critically about who to blame here. \n\nBecause of the nature of fighting crime, it is inevitable that the wrong people are going to be arrested. It is then the job of the judges, and lawyers to make sure that person has a fair trial and that the evidence against them is solid. \n\nToo often people blame the police for all issues related to the criminal justice system. But consider that the district attorneys who proceed with lacking evidence, and the juries that convict these people are just as culpable. \n\n&gt;\tA fair point can be made that there are other factors that go into that 50% of unsolved crime, like prosecution failures, corruption, and maybe skilled criminals, but our cops should be better at their jobs than they are.\n\nA fair point that most would agree with. Unfortunately the how is the difficult part. There isn\u2019t a crime wand that the police can wave and make it all better. \n\nWith a more robust surveillance state you could probably catch more criminals, but do you really want that? \n\n&gt;\tSo that\u2019s the problem, the cops are inept, corrupt, abusive,\n\nAnd some of them are intelligent, hard working, and noble. I get that they cover for bad cops. But too much emphasis is placed on individual officers when they really have the least power for change. \n\nIt\u2019s a tough job and we need to start holding the District Attorney\u2019s and judges that refuse to target the bad cops accountable. \n\n&gt;\tand the justice system is a ponderous bureaucracy, and that\u2019s why it takes six years, and honestly we\u2019re lucky it took six years, \n\nIt\u2019s ponderous by design. It\u2019s interesting how the things you rail against (wrongful incarceration, and mistaken identity) are solved by a slow moving justice system.\n\n&gt;\tand honestly we\u2019re lucky it took six years, that\u2019s actually pretty fast in regards to how justice usually goes he\n\nThat\u2019s not true, especially because \u201cjustice\u201d isn\u2019t defined. But I would say the turnaround for a murder for instance would be about 3 years. But if you include appeals and everything else then yeah it could be closer to 6. \n\nBut that\u2019s a good thing! A fast judicial system would see more people wrongfully convicted.",

Surprise surprise, the actual perpetrator was the guy literally everyone said was probably the murderer the first time around.\n\nWe can also discuss things like the murder of Daniel shaver, and how his murderer was allowed to retire with pension even though we have clear video.\n\nOr maybe the cop that murdered his wife after they gave his gun back. The gun he used to shoot his wife the first time. Which is why they took it in the first place.\n\nSo let's not pretend it's all gas station robberies or complex harassment plots.",

Michelle spent almost 3 months in jail before they realized here innocence. Angela was sentenced to some years in prison and it looks like Ian is about to be sentenced to a long time.\n*a word",

Now  Michelle suing the US Marshall, Angela and the police dept that threw her in jail for 3 months.  I suspect the US Marshall at trial defense will be that he had no idea  what his wife was doing.

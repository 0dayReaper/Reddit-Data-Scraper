Like you know someone's gonna do it, that's the whole thing about this game, you build it, and hopefully you can get it done before someone or something destroy it.\nThat's the whole purpose of the game, that's exactly WHY it's fun. It's fragile, and a sneeze can break it, but you gotta keep stacking until you made a pyramid, it's stressful and it keeps you on edge.\nLike ok what if the person didn't knock it out, you think she would have glued it and taken it home?\nThink Marcus think!",

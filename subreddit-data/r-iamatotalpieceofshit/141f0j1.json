He went to the store and stabbed the butcher, and this place had a boiling oil container, common in a lot of places in Mexico, where they will cook some meat for you, the guy on his way out grabbed the dog and throw it there, which was from a family that lived next door. In Mexico, animal abuse gives you between 6 to 10 years in prison, and prosecutors are looking to add years for the attempted murder of the butcher. The President of Mexico spoke about this case, that man is definitely staying behind bars for a while. It has caused quite a stir and every news outlet in Mexico is talking about it.",

I came home to plastic shreddies everywhere and a giant grin on the dogs face. It didn't even give her the runs or anything either. I don't really eat chocolate, so I didn't even open it. She had all of it.\n\nI doubt she's as immune to cops, though.",

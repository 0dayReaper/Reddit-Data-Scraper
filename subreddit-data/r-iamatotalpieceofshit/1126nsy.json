It\u2019s a sick &amp; twisted cultural tradition that literally mixes J\u0101hiliyah practices (which Islam literally came to overturn) with the religion of God itself\u2014thus creating a false after-the-fact justification for their evil deeds, because they have mixed together the religion &amp; their culture, and used the former to justify the latter. It reminds me perfectly of the verse which says:\n\n**\u201dAnd when they commit an immorality, they say, \u201cWe found our parents doing this; and also, God has commanded us to do it!\u201d Say, \u201cGod does not command immoral deeds. Are you attributing to God what you do not know?\u201d** _(Qur\u2019an 7:28)_\n\n^^^ This is exactly what\u2019s happening with some of these uneducated communities. And notice how the verse doesn\u2019t even bother to refute that \u201ctheir parents/ancestors practice this\u201d\u2014it just goes straight to condemning their justification of it using God &amp; religion, since it is completely false. And that\u2019s exactly what we see today. And sadly many people who don\u2019t know any better are being misled, and think this is what Islam promotes. Astaghfirullah.",

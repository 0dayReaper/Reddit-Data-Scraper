It\u2019s not psychoactive components, just broken down metabolites of THC that linger.  But yeah, you\u2019re wrong dude.",

Cops are not trained to try to run plates in these situations, they can turn their lights on, pull the offender over and then safely run plates from the shoulder. Cops are not ever told to let individuals who are going 150% the speed limit go, wtf why are you making up bullshit like this?",

It is as if going slower or stopping for people in smaller vehicles/ on foot or for animals was somehow humiliating for him, as if being a decent human being was hurtful to his ego*.",

Sadly tho, at least where I live in Ontario, if you cause an accident or damage your vehicle by trying to avoid an animal your insurance does not cover you unless you hit the animal. That\u2019s not to say you have to accelerate into the animal but it makes it difficult to safely avoid them. I always do my best, especially if I\u2019m driving alone to allow animals to cross the street but unfortunately In busy traffic you don\u2019t have that freedom to slow down/stop. Thankfully I\u2019ve never hit an animal but I\u2019ve seen many people like the one you mentioned who feel the need to accelerate into animals. \n\nOne of my biggest pet peeve\u2019s with driving is watching people use the bike lane to avoid traffic when trying to turn right. Ive seen a handful of cyclists get hit because of this",

I yelled at them and ran to see if I could help the very flat opossum, while they went up a block and had to stop at a red light. An OLD - guys, ancient. You would not have expected this - lady carrying shopping bags set them carefully on the ground, rummaged in one, and pulled out a glass bottle filled with red(sauce?) and threw it at their windshield as they pulled into the intersection. Red liquid exploded over the car, the kids in it got out and started yelling at the lady. She picked up her bags and kept walking. I went and walked behind her for half a block. Not thinking I was protecting her or anything, more wanting to just be on her side. The kids didn't follow, got back in the car, drove away. I never got closer to her than half a block and to this day wish I'd talked to her. She was so absurdly casual about it. I didn't see the windshield but I hope dearly that it was cracked. Possum did not make it, but I have forever since been adamant about being nice to them lest an ancient woman of will cross your path.",

I get over to the left to get out from behind him so he doesn't try to break check me and he then rolls down his window and stays at my pace to try to confront me.\n\nYou know I'm in a merging lane, my blinker has BEEN on and you leave space for me to merge in my tiny car while you're in a truck wtf did you think I was going to do??? I honestly assume dude was on his phone not paying attention accidentally left a gap and hit the gas as I merged thinking I cut him off. \n\nLike wtf is wrong with some people. I had JUST dropped my 5 yo off at his dad's too. I'm just glad he wasnt in the car. \n\nSome drivers are way too easily triggered to be driving",

I'm seeing college kids risking their lives working in remote places interviewing aggressive anglers without receiving a livable wage. Oh and the racism? Borderline psychotic. \n\nThey'll blame anything from native tribal members allowed to take as much fish as they need (we have a federal treaty with native tribes that allow them to sustenance fish, not just sports fish) to sea lions doing what they've been doing since 7 - 30 million years ago. \n\nI absolutely hate this anti-government, far-right bullshit culture wars nonsense treating anything the government does as an act of oppression... I'd love to see these types of folks drink riverwater or mercury-infused well water instead of government funded purified water. See how long it takes dysentery and crapping out your own intestines until you change your mind, duck-dynasty-neck-bearding  looking ass. \n\nThanks for coming to my TEDxRant, the guy being interviewed in the video has my respect though, we need more anglers like him.",

I started throwing turkey legs to the sea lion. My friend got so mad at me\ud83e\udd23. I didn\u2019t care. Then he said wait until that vicious thing gets in this canoe. At that point I realized it was a bad idea. I don\u2019t know if they actually attack people in canoes, but it was eating frozen turkey legs like they were cookies. I\u2019m pretty sure it would have won any conflict with two guys in a canoe",

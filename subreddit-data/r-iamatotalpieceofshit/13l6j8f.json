            "comment": "I have a similar problem with an upstairs neighbor filling plastic bottles with cigarette butts and kicking it off his balcony when it's full... It inevitably ends up on my terrace since I'm on ground level. Tried talking to him about it, says sorry, keeps doing it... So I started lobbing them back up when I have 4 or 5 of them... next step is opening them and either fill his mailbox with the butts or spread them on his car windshield. What is it with cigarette smokers just fucking littering everywhere all the time?",

They\u2019re unaware of how bad they stink, and anyplace they go has a lingering stench of cigarette for a long time after. There\u2019s some smoker in my building and the mail room reeks for hours after their gross disgusting body with cigarette stench woven into the fibers of their clothes has left it every day. They\u2019re so used to smelling disgusting they actually think spraying some body spray or opening a window removed the scent. A burden on humanity. Ever been stuck behind one driving 20 mph on a road with few turns?",

And the worst is that they smoke in their homes with small children living there.",

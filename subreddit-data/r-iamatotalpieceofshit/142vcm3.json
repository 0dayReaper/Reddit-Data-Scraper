Another example would be if you had a glass door and the person on the other side was pointing a gun at you.  If that person isn\u2019t an active deadly threat with the means to follow through, then shooting them would make you the active deadly threat.\n\nEdit:  Just realized you said \u201copen door or not.\u201d  If the door is open, there are myriad scenarios where someone could legally and morally use deadly force to defend themselves.  Far more than if there\u2019s a strong/insurmountable barrier between the individuals.",

But you better believe if it was a young white mother that was shot, the shooter would be arrested on scene. Unfortunately, my country was built on the backs of African Americans. Everything here in seeded in systemic racism. For fucks sake, the reason the police started was to catch runaway slaves. Then after slavery ended, their purpose was to keep rich people and their property safe from the poors, immigrants, and persons of color. We have made progress, but it isn't enough. Bigotry and hate is handed down from generation to generation. It's better in some places than in others. Where I live, things are improving. But in places like the south, the hate and ignorance runs strong",

You can Google and read a billion articles on both of you like but the simple explaination of them is this.\n\nSYG means you do not have a duty to retreat in a place where you are legally allowed to be in in order to defend yourself. So if you're at a Starbucks and someone is trying to hurt you, you are not required to remove yourself from the situation fist.\n\nCastle doctrine is that you are \"king of your castle.\" If you are inside your home or car and someone enters it, illegally, then you have the presumption of \"great bodily harm or death.\" Because of that you immediately have the ability to use or thereaten the use of deadly force. So, if you are in your house now and someone breaks in you can kill them and theoretically you are immune from ALL civil and criminal suits. The family cannot sue you for killing or hurting their son/husband/brother and the state cannot charge you with murder.\n\nCharges are usually brought if it's clearly not SYG or castle doctrine or if it's shaky. If you are sleeping and someone breaks into your bedroom and starts stabbing you and you kill him, you have nothing to worry about (legally, medically your screwed with the bills).",

Castle doctrine wouldn\u2019t apply because of the fact that she never open the door the woman was simply knocking on the door, which is neither illegal nor a legally threatening act. Where gets dubious is a amendment made to this law in 2018 in Florida that stated that as long as you have proof of fear, it can still apply which means the burden of proof lies on the prosecutor to prove that there was no reason to be afraid. Thankfully, it\u2019s also fairly easy to prove there\u2019s no reason to be afraid as it was simply knocking on a door, and there\u2019s no way to prove that she was actively threatening her, we know she was an armed, and we also know why she went up there that being that the shooter had stolen her property and that she was asking for it back. \n\nSo essentially castle doctrine cannot really defend anything in this act, so she is still going to get prosecuted, and there\u2019s a high chance that she will still be declared guilty because she murdered someone who was asking for their property back and was knocking at her door.",

Once a prima facia case of self defense has been raised by the defendant they have the option of a self defense immunity hearing. This is like a mini trial where both sides present their arguments and evidence to the trial judge. Pre 2017, the defendant had to prove self defense by a preponderance of evidence. If they did, they were granted criminal immunity. If not, they go to the real trial. \n\nIn practice, it turned out that the judges never found that the evidence favored self defense by a preponderance of evidence. This ended up hurting the defendant more in the actual trial. The legislature changed the burden of proof in this pretrial hearing to having the prosecution disprove self defense by clear and convincing evidence, which is a lower standard than beyond a reasonable doubt.",

A gun is a tool and not everyone needs it . I believe it is irrational for people in Alaska to not be able to carry guns on them. It puts their lives at risk but in a big city I see no reason why anyone would carry around an assault rifle or an smg, especially if they are not certified or registered. Stray bullets kill also. Knife crime can be curved with police action and stricter sentences not by giving the criminals free access to firearms for them to have daily shootouts with police and law abiding citizens.",

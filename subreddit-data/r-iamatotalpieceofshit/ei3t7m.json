Charges can be brought up but usually if it's a hardship case they'll just be glad the kids are safe. You can also transfer guardianship of you have a family member or friend that can take them. For newborns I've always heard you can drop them off at the hospital or manned fire station. I luckily have never needed to know this info well and it does vary by state as always.",

Here is how it works in SC. \n\nDaniel\u2019s Law is a law designed to provide a safe haven for abandoned babies. Named for an infant boy who survived after being buried in a landfill soon after his birth, Daniel\u2019s Law is intended to save babies by providing a safe haven for them.\n\nThe law allows for an unharmed infant, up to 60 days old, to be left in the care of an employee or staff member of a \u201csafe haven\u201d without fear of prosecution to the parents. A safe haven is defined as any of the following facilities: hospital or hospital outpatient facility, law enforcement agencies, fire stations, emergency medical services (EMS) stations or a house of worship during the time the church or synagogue is staffed. Hospitals are the preferred safe haven, followed by EMS services if a hospital is not close by. It is completely confidential. The person leaving the child does not have to reveal his or her identity. However he or she may be asked to provide medical information for any personnel who may treat the child.\n\nOnce the child is in the care of a safe haven, the Department of Social Services will be contacted and will then have legal custody over the child. DSS will then immediately pursue family court action to free the child for adoption.\n\nDaniel\u2019s Law is not intended to hurt or punish anyone.  It is to help ensure that babies have safe haven in the event that his or her parents cannot care for them.\n\nIf you are pregnant and confused or frightened about what to do with your baby or know someone who is pregnant and in crisis, please contact the Department of Social Services, your local health department or your local hospital.\n\nThis information is brought to you by SCHA in collaboration with the Children\u2019s Committee of the South Carolina Bar.",

That's very definitely not the case. Of course *anyone* can feel that way. Just like some parents care less for their children than they do their clothes or cars. \n\nI was just anecdotally saying that once ***I***  had kids, ***I***  became much more sensitive to the suffering of children and have to moderate my feelings when on the internet in order to maintain my own mental health.",

Although since me having a kid was never a danger as Im male, who knows what id have done had I fallen pregnant while heavily addicted.",

                    "comment": "This happens in a lot of poor countries. I was in Malawi this summer and we helped out at some 'crisis nurseries,' which are basically orphanages for children under about 2 years old. They take care of kids who were abandoned (there was one kid who had been left in a pig trough, and another that had been found inside a pit latrine) or whose family are unable to provide for an infant. A lot of times there, the child is wanted, and they would be able to provide for the child once they're a bit older, but the parents can't take care of an infant because they can't afford infant necessities or they can't take care of an infant's needs while they're still working on their farm.\n\nWhat the crisis nursery does that I think is really cool is that they don't just take the child from the parents permanently. They try to work with the parents and other family to see if they'll be able to take the child back when they're a bit older and don't require quite so much direct care and such. Or, if something happened to the mother (like she died in childbirth, which is unfortunately common), often the family will want to keep the child but can't afford to buy formula, so they'll let the nursery raise the child just until they're off formula. So they really make an effort to keep the children with their families or in their communities rather than completely raising them in an orphanage or sending them with families abroad (though they will adopt them out to unrelated families if there's no familial/community option). I just thought it was awesome because I had never heard of any orphanage like that. And the kids there have it a lot better than many children who are raised by their families in villages; they try to feed them as much as they can and help with their development however they can because they know they can't really guarantee things when they've returned to their families. And it also provides work opportunities for local unmarried/widowed women who work as the nannies. It was a really cool idea. Not a perfect solution, of course, but a solution that's helping at least a little.",

That baby is either Aquaman, the Op saw it happen and decided to record as they went, or I am missing something.\n\nI have 3 boys and when they were younger I was terrified of them choking on a plastic bag, my work badge collar, etc.  The number of babies that die by suffocation or strangulation is absurd.  It\u2019s something like 1 in a 1000 in developed countries.",

I'll update this comment as soon as I'm able to link the screenshot.  \n\nFinally got the link..  \nhttps://ibb.co/n0t7TCN  \n\nI never used that sharing website before so I hope it works out. Couldn't use imgur as I don't have the app on my phone.  \n\nThe picture was released 3 days ago so the same day this incident happened, in case you're thinking the picture is from a different accident.  \n\nI tried to find a news article about it and I found some but they're all in arabic because it happened in Saudi Arabia.  \n\nSo I'll say what I said in another comment again, the guy is being slow because he wants to be careful since he's about to grab a newborn covered in a trash bag out of a freaking dumpster. You don't want him to slip and drop the baby and hurt him/her. And the other guy started filming probably because it only takes 1 person to grab the baby and it's good he filmed it as it can be used as evidance against whoever done that horrible thing to the baby if they find them, which I hope they will.",

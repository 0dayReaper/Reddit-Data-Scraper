Often times headaches start with the neck (cervicogenic headaches) and the pain relief there also helps the headaches. Chiropractics can also help with tension headaches (so does massages). \n\nThat\u2019s all the chiropractics can help with. And the chiropractors don\u2019t actually know why it works, anything about \u201calignments\u201d or \u201cadjustments\u201d or any explanation they give you (other than just popping your back / neck makes it feel good) is just flat out wrong. However, the BS explanations/lies can help with psychogenic pain as well. If the underlying factor of the pain is in the brain, the chiropractor can take advantage of the placebo effect if they can convince you that they know what they\u2019re talking about and treatments will work then there\u2019s a small but significant chance it does. \n\nIf you are experiencing back pain you should go see a doctor. As there may be a time sensitive reason for the back pain like a tumor. A chiropractor likely won\u2019t see it, but will pretend like they know what the cause of your back pain is and try and treat it as they usually do (and fail because they can\u2019t treat tumors), and by the time you figure that out, you just wasted precious time. \n\nSince spinal surgery is a very high risk surgery, it can be beneficial to try everything else for your back pain before going into surgery, including chiropractics.",

Do you know why they were ignored despite their grades? Because, in the words of one teacher, \"He IS NOT DISRUPTIVE IN CLASS...HE IS VERY WELL BEHAVED AND POLITE TO EVERYONE.\" So it isn't apparently enough to teach your kids manners, respect and how to behave like a decent person. I guess its true the squeaky wheel gets the grease. Compare to....\nYoungest child.... Teachers make a point of getting to know their students families. When child is behaving out of character, teachers don't hesitate to ask them what's going on. If a student has problems with the material taught, teachers tutor them after school, at lunch, at recess or before school starts. The point is, the teachers care very much about all their students, and the students care about their teachers. There were standards of behavior that were EXPECTED from the students, and they followed them, if not the parents were called into the office for a conference. By the time our youngest hit high school and moved to public, she had more education than some of the kids graduating, and was appalled at some of the language and actions of other students. \nThis sums up exactly why we sent the youngest to a private school.",

It was so bad, they could hear me snoring down the hall through two doors at six years old. My wife appreciates it more than anyone, as I haven\u2019t snored since they were removed. \n\nI will never understand why parents will make their children\u2019s lives more difficult just because they can\u2019t understand the need.",

Committed and connected criminals can still find a way, but are typically \"professional\" criminals and far less likely to use the gun against bystanders.\n\n- the argument that a safety measure is a removal of freedom is interesting and I can see it in an abstract sense but it doesn't stack up day to day.  Having a military is a safety measure, all laws are safety measure.  So this principle would see murder or paedophilia allowed - I'm assuming you wouldn't support this freedom.  There is often a trade-off between personal freedom to do what you want and public goods.  Guns like anything else fit in this spectrum.\n\nThe challenge in parts of the world where gun ownership is common is it's very hard to put the genie back in the bottle.  Who wants to hand in their weapon when we all consider ourselves to be the good guy.  In that context I do get your position.",

You can get a shotgun or rifle if you have \"good reason\" which basically means, being a farmer, having access to approved land for hunting (very little of it) or ongoing member of a shooting range.  Then you need to apply for a license (2 professional references, doctor reference, own a gun safe, no conviction of 3+years).  If you pass all this vetting including home inspection from the police, then you get a single particular gun licenced and only after they have taken a ballistic fingerprint.  This then has to be kept unloaded in the locked safe.  You can only remove it from the safe for the approved \"good reason\" (e.g. shooting range) and it must remain unloaded until at your destination.\n\nFor Switzerland, I'm less clear on the actual laws but my understanding is that those who have gone through military service take their handgun with them once discharged, but again needs to be kept unloaded in a gun safe.  Shooting ranges are a quite common hobby, but I'm pretty sure you are not allowed to conceal carry or transport a loaded gun.\n\nSo you can see, this is very different from what you're suggesting and more importantly very different from US gun laws.",

Furthermore you don't get to just keep you rifle and/or handgun, you have to give all your issued stuff back unless you opt to buy it, in which case you have military requirements to fulfill on top of civilian ones, and the rifle has to be comvertes to semi only. Only around 10% and decreasing do that. Considering we have around 150k soldiers, that's 15k guns a year while Z\u00fcrich itself issue 15k acquisition permits (up to 3 guns per permit) during the same time\n\nWe're looking at around 3.5mio civilian owned guns \n\nBy the way getting guns is pretty easy in Switzerland:\n\n* Bolt-actions, break-actions, hunting rifles are over-the-counter \n\n* Handguns and semis are under a shall-issue acquisition permit similar to the ATF form 4473 required in the US but less prohibitive \n\n* Select-fires and explosive launchers are under a may-issue acquisition permit similar to the ATF tax stamp but less prohibitive and issued within 2 weeks VS 6-12 months and not limited to pre-1986 like in the US\n\n\n&gt; but again needs to be kept unloaded in a gun safe\n\nGuns actually don't have to be stored in a safe, and can be stored loaded. Only exception is select-fires and down-converted semis which have to be stored separately from the bolt (still no mandatory safe)\n\n&gt; Shooting ranges are a quite common hobby, but I'm pretty sure you are not allowed to conceal carry or transport a loaded gun.\n\nWhile carry licenses are indeed basically impossible to get for the average Joe, we sont discriminate between concealed and open\n\nThat said, open carry of unloaded guns for transport is legal and the default method",

Countries from Mexico and southwards often have very strict gun laws for example. \n\nIn Europe countries with a lot of guns per capita is usually not any less safe than countries with fewer guns. The UK has 1-1.1 homicides per 100k, we have about the same in Sweden but we have 4x the amount of guns per capita. Norway has almost half the homicide rate and has 50% more guns than we do in Sweden. Switzerland is like Norway and has even easier access to firearms. The Czech Republic has had shall issue concealed carry for about 30 years and they too have a lower homicide rate than the UK.",

Firstly is licensing restrictions on vetting to get a gun, how it is stored, where it can be used.  Secondly, is the reason for owning a gun, e.g. hunting Vs self defense.  Thirdly is the type of gun, hand guns can be carried in a Hidden manor, rifles can't.  Automatic weapons can kill many people quickly, a shotgun can't.\n\nI would guess Sweden has 4x the number of guns than UK because there is a lot more land to hunt on, and that hunting would be the main reason to own a gun, and therefore it's a rifle or shotgun.  If you compare that to US, South America, Southern Africa, the most common motivator to own a gun is self defense.  Additionally these countries typically allow (or don't enforce against) the day-to-day carrying of the gun, and it being loaded ready to use.",

That means the most common guns are semi-auto rifles and pistols (revolvers are relatively rare).\n\n&gt;Automatic weapons can kill many people quickly, a shotgun can't.\n\nAutomatic weapons have been banned in the US since 1986.

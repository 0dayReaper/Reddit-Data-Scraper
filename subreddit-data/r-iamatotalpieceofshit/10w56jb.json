If you enter any thread on Reddit about cyclists you'll always find an incredible amount of hate and violent fantasies. Well, have a good look, this is the manifestation of that hate.

I'd wager almost everybody who regularly cycles on highways in the US can tell you stories.\n\nIt's absolutely shameful.",

As long as they don't interfere with traffic, there is nothing dangerous about doing that. Bikes can't injure people like cars can, and having to stop at every damn street while cycling really destroys the joy and practicality of it.",

In this situation it looks like his momentum just rolled him that way. \n\nThe back is the best way to land because landing on the bike HURTS. \n\nAlso- when we crash in a race situation, we always try Ti ball up and get small. That way other racers have a better change of not hitting you. \n\nAlso also- yes. Bikes can be VERY expensive. Mine was about $12,000 retail. Once you crash and realize nothing is broken- the first thing you do is check the bike.",

How dare he exercise his right to the roadways that have been taken over by massive metal death machines that go faster than any creature on earth, 120 mph of 2 tons of cheap metal and flammable materials is my right as an American. How dare he travel in a safer, healthier manner that causes less traffic for my *crowded* city. Like how entitled can you be just because you own a car, if you live in a crowded city walk or cycle, you don't really need a car, if everybody used public transportation, or cycled and walked when they could the roads wouldn't be so crowded and fucked for everyone. Also cars have gotten uglier and uglier and they all look the same now, and they are bigger and they could go farther on less gas, we sometimes spend some people's entire life savings on these things when for the same price you could take a plane anywhere in the world 100-300 times over and you might still have money to live off of for a year or multiple if you go somewhere cheap where the usd is worth more. I just find the concept of buying a new $50,000 car just to hate driving places anyways strange, like driving is only fun when you live in a smaller city or out in the burbs, otherwise it's just frustrating and loud, sounds of people's cheap shitty mufflers going off all night and day, car alarms, engines revving up, just every obnoxious sound they could think of crammed in one package that you have to pay them more every year to fix, replace tires, get brakes replaced, oil checked, and everything realigned every now and then. \n\nLike imagine buying a TV, and it always made extremely loud obnoxious noises at you and you, and it only played stressful ass advertisements you hate, and then you had to replace the parts for it every six months, and you couldn't do it yourself without extensive know-how and extremely expensive tools to diagnose what is wrong On top of that if it did stop working you would just lose your job and they put you on house arrest so you could only go a couple miles from your home.\n\nThat's what modern cars are, because of the invention of them we have cities that you need cars to get around reliably in, we have no trains really between cities, and they've fucked everyone who doesn't own one and blackmail the people that do need one with terribly high prices and high maintenance costs that happen more frequently because the engines are more complex just to make them faster, which they don't need to be if you are going the legal speed limit.",

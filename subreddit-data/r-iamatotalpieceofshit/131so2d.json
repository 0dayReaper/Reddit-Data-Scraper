What do you consider, \"the wildest?\" My craziest rides:\n\n* 2 AM, forty-mile trips from a strip club in Richmond, VA (RVA) to Fort Gregg-Adams (then Lee) because the servicemen were barred from any closer strip clubs.\n\n* Of the three major universities in/around RVA, University of Richmond's students *(lots of frats and law students)* were the worst. Multiple vomiting episodes, backseat blowjobs, the worst. Once I kicked a guy out of my car at the destination and dropped his passed-out passenger at the police station. Of course, without being paid for it. I wrote a letter to the president of the university and refused to pick up from UofR again.\n\n* That time I drove through a ghost in the middle of the road and confused the worldviews of myself and both of my passengers. *(Me, I think this is all a simulation.)*\n\n* That time in RVA that I drove a state representative I used to work for, and he didn't tip.\n\n* The guy who served time for murder, and shared that right after getting in my car, but was otherwise a polite customer.",

I was driving on a dark rural road in eastern/coastal Virginia, and it was misty. The streetlights were those old, yellowy lamps, but *between* two of them and from the middle of the road, was a blue column of light in the mist coming up from the road instead of down from the lights. When we passed through it, one of the two passengers yelled and said she felt cold. I felt like we drove through an electrical field and my skin/hair felt charged, but I always kept my car cold on Uber trips so I didn't feel any colder than usual.\n\nI could answer questions, but that's about all I can remember unprompted.",

Doc mailed him his meds, and someone stole them off of their porch. Never brought them back or anything after realizing what it was. Thankfully doc\u2019s office was able to call in an emergency script that was delivered by the next day. Still makes me absolutely sick to think about.",

In a lot of the videos, the kids seem old/smart enough to realise the items belonged to someone else, but they're still often treated like gifts or something to play with.\n\nThe thing that always really irritates me about people doing this is the entitlement you see. Like in those videos with the trapped box, the normal reaction to it going off isn't embarrassment or regret, it's anger at the person *who they stole from* as though they have been targeted. Really it's only people with that entitled world view who would feel comfortable just taking whatever box is in front of someone's house.",

If they have children, they will rely on them to translate for them because they\u2019ve had the opportunity for an education, they\u2019ve had the chance to learn early. English is considered one of the most difficult languages to learn because it\u2019s a mix of multiple different languages and there is no real set way to\u2026pronounce(?)(wood and would) words.\n\nGranted, perhaps they should at least hire a couple of Americans, a Mexican American if that makes them more comfortable, who is fluent in Spanish and English to help translate. Especially, if they plan to serve outside the Hispanic community. True, it would make life easier and, honestly for safety reasons but, they shouldn\u2019t be forced to assimilate if they do not wish too. So long as they follow the laws of our country, that should be enough.",

You need people that can speak English in a mostly English speaking country. They should've clarified somehow that there are no English speaking staff available to not cause any inconveniences like this one. So the reviewer is a pos for being racist but is in the right to leave a bad review",

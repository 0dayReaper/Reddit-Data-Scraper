Fans might not want to go to games if they keep hearing children scream like that. It might also annoy people watching on TV.  It's also funny that the people who don't want it banned are the people who don't watch sports and don't go to games.\n\n The NBA will only care about the actual fans. If it makes people not want to watch games, the NBA will ban it for sure. The money and fans are all that matter regardless of your personal opinion.",

Tv watchers can hear her over everything else. She\u2019s literally causing players to miss free throws. I imagine her screech would give me a migraine hearing it over and over. She\u2019s being a hindrance to people who have paid to watch the game.\n\nLike imagine you paid hundreds of dollars to watch a game in person, and you leave with ringing in your ears cause a 9 yo won\u2019t stop literally screeching at the top of her lungs. If she wasn\u2019t the daughter of a player she definitely would have been either told to stop or kicked out. This is my main complaint, it\u2019s kinda rich privilege.",

While Diar Derozan\u2019s screaming definitely seems to have worked, you should be upset with the players, not her. \n\nIf you\u2019re upset about the noise, then I would advise you not to go to a NBA game in Toronto, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Sacramento, San Fransisco, Milwaukee, and many more stadiums.

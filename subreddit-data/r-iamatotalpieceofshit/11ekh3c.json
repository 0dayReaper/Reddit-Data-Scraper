She went to get it and he grabbed it from her and did the same thing. Threw it out the window. Poor kitty was already injured before he did it, because of him, and he did it **twice**. When she tried to go get the cat again, he grabbed her by the neck. Someone witnessed this and tried to step on and he grabbed them as well, but when he heard the police were coming, he fled.\n\nI'd bet cash money he was jealous of her affection for the cat. Her response of protection, of showing how important the cat was to her, was the perfect ammo for him to hurt her. It's a pattern I've seen before with abusers. With fur babies and with children. So many screaming red flags and sirens. If they don't treat this with the seriousness it needs, there will be serious violence down to the road. \n\nI'm so sick of shitty people.",

In other words, you can't force an individual to take their meds or to attend counseling. Insurance issues, lack of a fixed domicile, and other factors compound the problem.",

He signed a fairly substantial contract and then the wheels started falling off. He went through several teams in the league ended up having to play overseas and then left the game all together. He was self described as poor and happy and the money and fame was something he greatly struggled with. It led to substance abuse, self harm, and severe depression and anxiety. He got help from Mark Cuban and was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and was put on antidepressants. At some point he said decided he wasn\u2019t properly diagnosed and basically said it was all the basketball lifestyle but at that point it was also evident he had slipped back into addiction and was running with the wrong people once again. He was arrested a few times for guns and other charges. He used his money and bought his parents and various others homes, got married and divorced after having 2 sons. He burned through most of his money from his basketball career and at some point was hospitalized, later he was found wandering in the streets in a hospital gown after checking out against medical advise. Again people stepped up to help him because it was widely believed he had become homeless. He denied the rumors but was later found on the streets around Dallas panhandling for money which again made headlines. This is where Mark Cuban went and picked him up personally took him to rehab which he paid for personally. At one point he was doing good and had a job at the rehab facility and then somehow we came to this current video. There could be more at the end but I didn\u2019t catch or follow it.",

They out these people into treatment centres and then after they will go into education, work programmes or full time employed the overdose rate has gone down 75% in the last 25-30 years.",

Coulda changed a little from when I took the classes as it was before the fentanyl epidemic became so massive but the opioid crisis was already full bore and people were already starting to abuse the fentanyl patches. That covered all drug addiction too so Id imagine things like opioids and meth along with how you choose to consume the drug make massive differences from substance to substance depending on your poison like the one guy was saying about his 4 stints in rehab and the people he knew. Id imagine those were the worst additions they were all mainlining as well. Pill poppers who haven\u2019t fallen to that level of addiction definitely have better odds of successful recovery so there\u2019s a lot of variables to the rates of relapse and recovery for sure.",

Delonte was doing well while he was in the rehab center, he even started to work there and support others. It appears that Delonte West was really helping his parents and other family members out and it seems like they just used him. Where are they now where he really needs them? I can only imagine Delonte feels a lot of shame. \n\nI was watching a previous conversation he did briefly on the street with someone and Delonte mentioned he was diagnosed with M.S and he mentioned that sometimes he even forgets that he played for the NBA. He\u2019s going through a lot. At this point he probably isn\u2019t even aware he needs help. Getting him treatment far away from his family would probably be the best, if only he accepts it and gets on whatever medication he needs.",

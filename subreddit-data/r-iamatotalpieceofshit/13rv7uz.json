From Wafflehouse fights, to Mcdonald's freakouts, to pretty much anything that has to do with HUMAN social behaviour. It mainly comes from America. LOOK at all the clips on reddit?... Its Mainly America. What was shown here is no different, especially in an illegal car meet. All these people were trying to do is go home. \n\nAgain, Entitlement is part of America's culture. Why do you think there are no strong gun regulations? Remember who was leading in COVID deaths when the pandemic hit? If there is a perfect example of entitlement. COVID pandemic + America would be it. They were beating INDIA at one point in COVID deaths.\n\nAmerica is \"addicted\" to the term \"freedom\".",

Week ago , indian court sentenced a poor driver to life imprisonment for transporting cow. judge in his judgement observed \" cows are gods . Their cow dung and piss is sacred . Gods reside in cows and the day people outside India stop eating beef, all problems of world would come to end... Yes this was observed by Indian courts , sentencing a poor man to life imprisonment, probably because driver was Non hindu.",

The car isn't any more or less blue depending on where I put the adjective, at least that's how I look at it.\n\nBut I'm asking out of genuine curiosity, so do correct me if I'm wrong please",

Both of them and my current partner (who has psychosis) had been street homeless at some point/s in their lives.\n\nIt's still not uncommon nowadays for the former two, but when they lived on the streets, people would routinely shout abuse, point, laugh and film them- uploading footage to local FB groups etc, trash or set fire to their sleeping areas and possessions etc among other things. A lot of time it was people who were well dressed and spoken. The sort of people that if you complained about their behaviour to someone else, without evidence, chances are you wouldn't be believed.",

I never hear about any charities funded by the church. They believe they are the charity just to pay themselves to buy private jets from Tyler perry at such a great deal you can\u2019t not buy it. \nHow do people give money to people that have more than they do? I\u2019ll never understand. If you want to donate for the homeless go to a soup kitchen and hand them the money. Or go buy the food yourself and krogers will even deliver it for you!!!!",

Like, just say you don't like heavy metal instead of trying to say that God killed people for enjoying their life the way they want with the free will God gave them. Buncha goobers, man. Condolences to the families of the victims.",

It is generally done for shock value. However, actual satanic metal bands do exist and are most prevalent in the black metal genre.",

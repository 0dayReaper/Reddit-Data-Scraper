I don\u2019t count the days since my last doughnut, I just don\u2019t eat them. \n\nThe way AA and NA go about sobriety is if you slip up and have just one drink, you can throw away all that clean time. Which psychologically kinda encourages people to just go back on a bender. \n\nI think it\u2019s a bit counterproductive, but I would never give someone shit for their sobriety. Ultimately the person who cares about it the most is you. And for me it\u2019s personal. I usually don\u2019t tell anyone, mainly because a lot of people see addiction as a moral issue. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m just hard on myself but I consider loosing weight and quitting drinking just a part of me growing up, not really an accomplishment, just what needed to be done. \n\nI think the main takeaway here is that if you can\u2019t say anything nice, don\u2019t say anything at all.",

Which is a pretty fucked up thing to say to someone in recovery with years of sobriety. \n\nThey encourage you if you are in their secular program. But if you are sober without it they seem to be spiteful and perhaps jealous. \n\nhave a relapse in AA and that\u2019s just part of recovery. Have a relapse outside of it and it\u2019s all your fault for not being in AA.",

Sometimes people get so hung up on spreading the message and sharing what\u2019s worked for them that they don\u2019t remember some people are different. \n\nIf you\u2019ve relapsed and still don\u2019t do AA I think that\u2019s where the judgement is coming from, they basically think \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t this person just wake up and realize it\u2019s gonna keep happening until they change something?\u201d It\u2019s valid until you realize people within the program relapse. \n\nRelapse is the rule, not the exception for addicts, period. AA has the \u201cno true Scotsman\u201d fallacy sometimes, where if you don\u2019t fit the mold of who can get helped, you\u2019re not a \u201creal alcoholic.\u201d If you relapse it\u2019s cuz you were doing something wrong. \n\nI have almost a year and a half in AA with no slip ups so far. I\u2019m very fortunate and I\u2019ve been blessed to have a manageable time of early sobriety. There are people in my home group who have 35+ years and are my role models for being a \u201cone chip wonder\u201d as we call it. \n\nThere are also people in AA with decades who don\u2019t sponsor or do service work and sorta maybe attend meetings occasionally. That works for them. \n\nThere are people outside of AA who have decades and have never even heard of the steps. \n\nSometimes people get stuck on their own way of thinking because they genuinely do want to share it, but I\u2019m sorry they\u2019ve been so preachy about it. No one has a monopoly on sobriety",

I\u2019ve never been into AA/NA I think a lot of the things they do are counterproductive. I don\u2019t really keep track of my clean time either. Just like you I just kinda feel like it was part of growing up and maturing and something that needed to be done. But hey whatever works for other people. If counting their clean time makes it work for them then that\u2019s great! Best wishes to you to stay healthy!",

The tricky part is people and problems are complicated and it usually requires trial and error to figure it out. Some people never do; and saying one way is wrong or less effective or better or whatever can muddy the waters and hold people back. But sometimes, for some people, that can help them to have confidence that something is definitely right or wrong. It's kind of a crutch but if it works it's hard to argue against it. Basically there's a lot of grey area that is hard to define one way or another. But in my opinion, it seems like it helps the average addict to have the \"one day at a time\" mentality and focus on accomplishments of time being sober. The risk clearly is them going on benders if they slip up in the slightest. But maybe it's still the only way those types of people can do it at all. They have to hit rock bottom again, then hopefully get back on the path to recovery. I think your mentality is an interesting and solid way to accomplish goals as well, though maybe not for the majority of people.",

Old timers are also generally the people who are best to shut a newbie up if they\u2019re derailing a meeting or only saying war stories. Not that you\u2019re infallible if you have lots of time but I\u2019ve never seen that behavior, much less a few in every meeting. \n\nKinda comes with the territory of each meeting being different and not having a big hierarchy though, so maybe that person is just in an area with bad meetings :/",

People tend to think that the dependency itself is the sickness, but in reality it's a symptom. The body of an alcoholic reacts much stronger and differently to alcohol than for other people, making them more prone to dependency.\n\nOf course, anyone can be sucked into the dependency. The difference is that \"actual\" alcoholics have it easier to fall into the pit.",

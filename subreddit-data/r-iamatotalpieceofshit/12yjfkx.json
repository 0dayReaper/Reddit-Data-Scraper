The ones I worked with were almost all in state custody removed from families. Kid I worked with was starved in his house for two months, beaten so severe he had a metal plate in his head. Another kid I worked with watched his mom, a prostitute, get murdered in front of him. I wanted to build up their self confidence, cause life is hell if no one is in your corner.\n\nIn my room was a wall of dreams. Every youth that came through those doors I found out what their goals were and they stayed on that wall until the got their goal, a daily reminder that it wasn't about me at the end of the day and a constant reminder that no one else was helping their dreams.\n\nI have suffered a few major concussions, lots of minor concussions, two ribs were broke, many lacerations from pencils or fingernails. I was spit on, bruised, and broken but you can't predict a trauma response you can only control if you show up for the person who punched you the day before.\n\nThe longer I stayed in that role the more it bothered me. The CEO's take home after wage cost and bills was 6,000 dollars per month per youth. I changed my goal but didn't make it. I wanted to take what I knew about that system and push for real reform with legislators. Career died during COVID, now I just quietly vote for people I hope can make a change.\n\nI don't have enough left in my tank to work my way up a second time. I now have panic attacks when I'm in a group of teens or in a place they may gather. I stutter now due to the concussions and I have a constant battle trying to fight my own brain on the daily. \nNo one comes out of a treatment facility for the better.",

A lot of people don't realize the personal toll. I've never been attacked by a client, but I have by their abusers. I've been assaulted,  put in the hospital, had my life threatened so many times I lost count. But the worst part is the regression happening in our system. We had made progress getting new laws in place with stricter restrictions after arrest, with keeping abusers from getting guns, etc. And then that orange POS came along and undid the progress and his cohorts have made it possible for abusers and rapists to fight for custody of children, and backtracked on laws meant to protect the vulnerable and made it easier than ever to get guns. It's frustrating, draining, soul crushing work, and I am grateful every day for people like you, who try to make a real difference in the lives of traumatized people, instead of adding to the horror they've already faced. It takes a remarkable person to do this kind of work in the face of unpredictable trauma response and the lack of empathy, lack of compassion, and lack of a soul in the part of the owners/CEOs of facilities like that.",

It was a separate building, with two sides to it- one for the severely disabled, non-vocal, SPED kiddos, and the other for behavioral issues like ones mentioned here. The kids on the behavioral side were the sweetest kids I've ever known, especially to the SPED kids on the other side (who idolized them!) and had behavior-based reward jobs assigned with helping the SPED kids, serving lunch, making brownies for staff, etc. The classes were smaller, more tailored to each child's needs, more effective reward/consequence system, and while we had lockdowns more often than a normal highschool, they never once were aggressive towards anyone other than themselves. When explosions (which we called \"behaviors\") happened, it was always due to frustration on their own end or miscommunication, and once separated, they were coached on how to calm down and control their emotions and responses in a healthy and safe manner, which is far more than most \"normal\" teenagers receive. I highly, highly recommend these types of school options for troubled teens (honestly I think public schooling would be much more successful if this type of teaching was implemented everywhere!) They get to have a semblance of \"normal highschool\", have friends, form genuine friendships with staff/teachers/adults they can trust and confide in, get to go home everyday, while still getting the extra support and training they need to grow into genuinely good adults.\n\nEdit: granted, I don't know what every school district looks like. This may not work in every situation, but from what I witnessed, (including the caring staff I worked with), it was extremely beneficial.",

I know someone who went there, they teach the girls how to do their makeup so they can be attractive to their husbands. They also heavily favor the boys, especially the ones on the football team. \n\nThat's not even close to the worst they've done, just gives you an idea of the culture. This is the third confirmed death of a child in their care, and I've heard unconfirmed rumors of a fourth. Not to mention all the kids that have been permanently hurt, both mentally and physically, because of the abuse they've endured. \n\nThe place should be shut down forever. Sadly, it's actually considered to be one of the better troubled teen facilities in Utah, which says a lot about the other ones that don't make the news.",

I was a nightmare in high school to say the least. But I always respected my parents. Kids who grow up hating their parents usually have a reason. Then they pay to make their own mistake somebody else\u2019s problem.\n\nLike imagine either not doing your due diligence to investigate the places supposed to reform your children or not caring. The parents in this case fucking suck too. \n\nMy mom sent me to rehab twice and a sober house and did everything in her power to look into the place and find a place for me and it actually helped because that\u2019s what it was designed to do. I\u2019m sure most of these parents don\u2019t give enough fucks to actually try. Infuriating to see children with problems be abused further and their parents paying for it.",

She kind of looked at the other EMT then back at me. She asked what I had for dinner so I told her. She then asked what I had for breakfast that morning, and I said, \"I didn't have anything and this is not indigestion!\" She said, \"OK, so what did you want to do?\" I said, \"I'd like to go to the fucking hospital if it's not going to inconvenience you too much.\" That kind of pissed her off but they took me to the nearest hospital. \n\nWhen I went back to work, a guy that I work with said his wife worked for that ambulance company and the girl who was questioning me is one who always thinks people are faking illnesses just to get drugs.

Then noticed this red line that had already was getting near my armpit. Panicked and told the teacher I need to leave because of my \"red line\".  She said no and it can wait til after class no matter what I said.  Stupid me listened and called my dad too pick me up after. Since he knew the severity of it he rushed to school and took me to a hospital. Luckily the red line was already starting to fade once it reached my torso but the docs gave me some antibiotics and said dont listen to any teachers next time if its an emergency.  \n\nBasically a teacher put my life at risk because she thought I was \"faking it\"",

I've heard a lot of anecdotal evidence that doctors tend to be less likely to believe females.  I'm pretty sure there's studies out there that supports that too.  It's horrible.  People go to the doctor to get better, not waste time, money and effort.\n\nThe first ER also tried to bill her for coming in, even though she was denied service.  That didn't stick, especially since they had proof of the second, different ER accepting her immediately after.  The second ER, after removing it, said that the appendix bursting was imminent (as in likely less than 30 minutes from when they took it out).",

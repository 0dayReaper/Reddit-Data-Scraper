It\u2019s a reckless endangerment of life and it in rages me every time I go out driving I literally see hundreds of people on their phone whether it\u2019s on the highway or at a red light it doesn\u2019t matter. Do you know where my phone is when I\u2019m driving in my purse in the backseat practically I don\u2019t even know where it is most of the time but I\u2019d rather it like that my car is newer so I can answer phone calls if there\u2019s an emergency through a click of a button on my steering wheel and that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t need to be texting. If it\u2019s not important I can just call or just wait till I get to my destinations. This is ridiculous.",

Thankfully mom is super careful unlike person in the video.\n\nComments say sound is terrible, but even the thought of it's terrible, and I'm happy that the dog is at least okay (somewhere in the comments it said it was)",

We now have our deck chairs atop the railing so he can\u2019t get up there. \n\nThen he started finding gaps under the fence. There are now logs and barricades all around the bottom perimeter of our fence. \n\nHe got out the other day. Twice. I have, absolutely, no idea how he does it. I walked the perimeter of the yard several times and I\u2019m completely stumped. \n\nFortunately he\u2019s a mush-puff and we live on a quiet street. He\u2019s a big dog (80lbs), and can look quite intimidating\u2026he gets very jealous of our other dog and will sound angry, but he\u2019s never acted physically aggressive.",

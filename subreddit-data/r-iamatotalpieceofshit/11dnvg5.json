I started to feel ill the first time she started to cry and then the next time she did.\n\nI have ended up having to deal with a lot of people who are toxic or friends who have been in toxic relationships and it just makes me feel pitty for them, but then I see people like her and it makes it hard to pitty them, because they could do so much better to improve themselves, but they choose not to and so the cycle repeats.\n\nOne friend I knew was in a toxic relationship and in the end I had to just distance my self from them, because they were not wanting things to get better, but also I found it hard to help them.\n\nI am just sick of seeing toixicity and people thinking its the norm.",

If you look at the root cause analysis of some issues, it always seems to stem back to some awful parent. People who want and are totally capable parents should be having kids. It doesn't matter too much on money. Dolly Parton grew up with nothing and she's a wonderful person. It's the quality of the human being raising another person. I've met horribly abused people who ended up being a good parent because they took care of what they needed. Someone or something helped them and they wanted to stop the cycle. But there's still wayyyy too many unchecked toxic ass ppl having kids, it's heartbreaking because it's the kids who pay never the parent.",

When I got introduced, they told me \"no one likes her but we stay nice because we don't want her to ruin our lives with her insanity.\"\n\nSo till this day, she's exposed her kids to the worst situations. She's accessed women's shelters despite being the abuser. She has like 12 fb accounts because she's constantly getting banned for threatening people but needs the attention, so she makes new ones. And meanwhile people just pat her on the head and play nice so they don't have to deal with it.\n\nI can't help but think that if more people stood up to her early on, her illness wouldn't have progressed this far.",

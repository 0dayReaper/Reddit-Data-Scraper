Jeopardy questions are written by humans.  \n\nTo be good, you need extensive trivia knowledge and experience ( my good friend met her husband at a Jeopardy tryout- she is the brightest person I know and did not make it; he is semi-famous) and consume massive amounts of popular culture and media in the years preceding your trial.  You also need a lot of practice in pub or other contests against real people; this teaches you common incorrect answers, how quickly the average person can answer a simple \"everybody knows this\" question (do they think about it? do they blurt it out as an automatic response?), and helps you read the general depth one must dive into categories of knowledge to know the answers to questions written by other humans.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou must get comfy on camera.\n\nYou must practice with a button; I used a pull-to-release  large mushroom operator  ( a pushbutton Emergency Stop switch) with an NO contact block instead of the NC block normally found under a stop button to make a pair of practice podiums for my friends.  They just turned on a light and operated a door chime. \n\nI think this is what Jeopardy uses. Likely a modified Square D or Allen Bradley operator (they are the best I know of). But no two feel or operate exactly the same; there are slight differences in springs and friction and the contacts will operate at very slightly different stroke lengths- you have to hammer that sucker home and hope there is no glitch in the contact block that gives the person beside you a millisecond advantage. \n\nIt helps to be American and know your presidents, history as written by the victors and geography.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy GF and I watched a LOT of Alex and during the mid 1990's figured out which papers to read, which TV shows to watch, and to read movie adverts and watch previews whenever possible; this made Jeopardy pretty easy to master, though this process is much more complicated now.  One hint: the Guardian is still very relevant. Jeopardy writers will always read the Guardian Weekly or check it out online. ",

I have worked for a US Attorney as a legal researcher, as a musician, long-haul/OTR trucker, and as a statistician or analyst in many contexts - logistics, market research, and financial services, most recently. Work is up in the air after March, when my current contract ends. Still taking as many programming classes as I can get, since it was mainly SAS, R, and Python in school, with only a semester apiece of C++ and Java. So, active job-seeker, for sure. Might be working for a friend's company developing apps for Android, or going back into market research or manufacturing. No set specialty. Data is data.\n\nEdit: I'm not as old as you'd think, even with the number of career changes. Just seems that way, since data science is so broad. ",

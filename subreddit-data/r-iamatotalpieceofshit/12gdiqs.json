Even a kubaton/knife or pepper spray is a better option than a concealed handgun that might get you shot by police or a misunderstanding bystander with a gun.  Guns are effective for other stuff but in this case it just adds more risk.\n\nGuns are better for perimeter home defense than gun fights in the open. Assuming the gun is loaded: uncouple gun from holster, slide the stop or draw back the hammer&gt;aim down sight while gripping with two hands&gt;fire down sight.  It's actually a lot of steps to fumble over at close range.  Those John Wick movies might as well be magic because even the experts can't just ice people that easily.",

Have you ever successfully shot a moving target?  With a hand gun?  Have you seen all the videos of armed police officers fighting off a guy who reached for their gun?  Those are trained police.  Even experts require years of special training for successful CQC maneuvers.  A small blade or even a sharp pen would be far more effective in this kind of situation.\n\nI'm no expert but I am very accurate and I've never hit a moving target with just a handgun. I used a rifle and a shotgun to hit skeet, but a handgun is a magnitude more difficult which is why the majority of police shootings are less than 33% accurate.  Guns are not effective personal defense tools as the many that are available these days.  If you're going to handle a firearm in public you need a certain level of expertise that the majority of people don't have who aren't very familiar with a service weapon.",

You don't let the woman die.  Because that's what's on the line.  It doesn't matter what you think.  If you were the woman in this situation you would want someone to stop the death that's coming.   If she didn't fear for her life she wouldn't be trying so hard not to go with the crazy.  I own a gun I know they aren't really accurate but there are 1000 things a gun could do to stop this.  He could have shot out all the tires of the car.  The guy couldn't get away with the girl if the car couldn't drive.",

Doctors have malpractice insurance, I think law enforcement need to be better trained and should be paid more and then required to carry it.

In my city, the city did not pay workers properly, so the workers sued the city. The city was found to be wrong in not paying the workers, however the workers were not paid their unpaid wages because the city decided it did not give permission to be sued. The government will only get involved and make a person to whole at federal minimum wage regardless of what your rate of pay is supposed to be, however, they will not act on your behalf to make you whole if you have any form of employment contact. If you do, it is your responsibility to foot the bill to get those wages from your employer. This isn't looked at like the theft that it is, stealing time (or money by withholding), but rather as a problem for the worker to sort out on their own. So I wish the people in the government had to deal with the crappy laws they subject others to, but instead, they make sure they get theirs, always. For example, they still get paid during government shut downs, but the lower wage employees who work for the government and live pay check to paycheck do not get paid, cant pay their bills, and still have to show up. \n\nWe don't need this crap, but unless a bunch of people enter office with similar views and together create laws to add more checks and balances on power, the collective group that holds the power is not going to share any of that power.",

Sorry that you have to learn this today, but a lot of parents are financially crippled, or just bad parents. And that's only scratching the surface of what could cause child malnourishment because the list is longer than you read.\n\nThat is regardless however because parental situations aside there's no excuse for a child to go hungry. Especially in a country where we make more food than every single person can eat, where 40% of it gets thrown into landfills anyways. \n\nAnd there's no logical or good argument you can fight that with. There's nothing you can say to justify wasting more food while simultaneously starving kids. \n\n Kids shouldn't go hungry period",

People have a totally false idea of what human trafficking looks like because they are inundated with knock-off Taken retellings. Traffickers are not lying in wait at grocery store parking lots to kidnap suburban white girls so they can endanger the entire operation by getting law enforcement on their ass. \n\nThey are preying on vulnerable girls (and boys) who come to THEM seeking promises usually of employment and then are entrapped by a number of methods like holding their passport hostage. Or they simply have no other options (this is why they tend to go after migrants not people born and raised in the U.S).\n\nBut y'know no one cares about those kids.

What makes them so special?\"\n\nI think the appeal of mommy influencers lies in the fact that they provide a relatable and authentic look into the joys and struggles of motherhood. Many women can relate to the challenges of balancing work, family, and personal life, and mommy influencers offer tips, advice, and support to navigate those challenges. Plus, their content often includes adorable photos and videos of their children, which many people find enjoyable to watch. However, it's important to recognize that not all mommy influencers are created equal, and some may promote harmful messages or unrealistic expectations of motherhood. As with any influencer, it's important to be critical and discerning when consuming their content.",

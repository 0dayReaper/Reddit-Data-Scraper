Moms and 3 girls in one booth, dads and 3 boys in 2nd booth (back to back). Halfway through meal, had to interrupt the moms and explain that the dads were all oblivious and the kids (all under 8) were sipping the dad's beers. One kid drank so much he got sick, but not before he ate 2 bowls pasta with sauce and 2 ice cream cones. \n\nPuked everywhere, never apologized or at least offer to help clean, and tipped 5%. My other tables noticed this all happening, and my 4 other tables all tipped me 50%. \n\nFound out later that one of my other tables took photos of kids drinking beers, and reported it to CPS. Family called restaurant and myself a week later, saying it wad us that reported it. I found pics on FB, and directed them to start there. Not sure what happened with CPS. \n\nMORAL: If you go out to dinner, treat it like it's your house, you wouldn't leave that mess at your house. Watch ur kids, you had them, just because ur at a restaurant, they are not our responsibility,  and maybe don't drink alcohol if out to dinner with ur kids!",

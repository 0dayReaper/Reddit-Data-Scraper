He sees her as an extension of him and his image and not her own individual being. This is not cute or normal behavior. It\u2019s gross and toxic. \n\nI really hope for your own safety, and others, that you understand that this is not something you should look for in a partner, or aim to be like as a partner.\n\nETA: Though I think it\u2019s sweet that you\u2019re trying to be positive, but sometimes wanting to see the best in everything and everyone can blind you and it can dangerous situations.\n\nNaivety and ignorance are not always blissful.",

She's still driving. His body was so fucked up the only thing they could donate was his retinas. Her dad was a judge or prosecutor or something. Of course.

If for example a plate would break, it\u2019s either my fault for whatever I did with the plate ever, or the fault of the manufacturer. Things don\u2019t just break, ever. Also if I got hurt, it\u2019s my fault. Even if he actually caused it. Because I got hurt \u2018so I could blame him\u2019. He\u2019d say \u2018I did that on purpose to make him feel guilty\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to live with someone like that and keep your sanity.",

Most people don't research what the past parenting techniques are and adapt them to now. Home, love, care, support, income, and constant appreciation for whatever they accomplish. Positive reinforcement and good values is a perfect foundation. Safety is priority, carefulness is next. If you want your kid to not be fucked up, don't be fucked up.",

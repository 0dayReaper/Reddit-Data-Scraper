They are recruited opportunistically, and quite frequently mess up.\n\nThe intelligence officers recruiting and handling them will usually try to give them some basic advice, but they aren't that much more likely than anyone else to listen to good advice.\n\nIn this particular case it seems they were recruited in 2013. They weren't sent into Sweden as trained operatives. They were actual Russian immigrants and were later recruited because they seemed usefully positioned (running several businesses).",

Then you need to pair exit node requests with entry node requests by making guesses based on packet size, time of entry and exit, and other heuristics. Once you have the pairs, your exit node can read the request, and your entry node knows who made the request.\n\nThis of course includes spending a ton of money on infrastructure, luck that both the entry and exit node of a request is controlled by you, doesn't work after the fact (requires constant monitoring for every time period you want data from), and you still don't know the content of the requests if the message is https and the content is in the body, not in the url, but at least you can say \"I know that XYZ made a search request to duckduckgo through TOR\".",

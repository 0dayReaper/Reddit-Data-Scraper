But by law (Germany), you only need half the distance to the car in front of you in cities compared to out of cities. Why? Because there is not enough space in the cities. You make up for it by looking ahead more than one car and anticipating when it brakes. Regardless of the law, that's how people drive in the cities. How are you going to anticipate someone brake-checking you like that? That's why the biker has no fault here and why the previous comment is downvoted.",

Looking not only at the car in front of me, but also at the car in front of that. When that car breaks I know that the person in front of me will break aswell, so I can just release the foot from the gas pedal, slow down and can often avoid needing to break entirely, which improves fuel economy\u2026",

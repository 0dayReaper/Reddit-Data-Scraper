Rumor has it chomos still get the worst of it even among the convicted rapists, but I still make a conscious effort not to think about prison yard justice to placate myself as a substitute for appropriate sentencing (not saying you did that). Protection in prison often means isolation, while overcrowding can lead to having a cell mate in isolation. So it's not hard to guess that these forms of justice are still occurring despite the half hearted efforts to curb them.",

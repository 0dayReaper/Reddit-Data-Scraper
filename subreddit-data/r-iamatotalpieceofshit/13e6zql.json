They must have been embarrassed because I got one minute walking down the footpath and 2 police cars and a van come speeding up and skidded to a stop beside me about 6 officers in total hopped out of the vehicles and pounced on me. \n\nThey put me in cuffs, and 2 of them held my face down while the others stood around me. Then one of them called me and I looked up to see the fat cop I had been cheeky too standing there smiling.\n\nThen he booted me in the face with what must have been steel toe caps. They had to take me to hospital because I was knocked out for a minute and I needed 3 stitches in my chin. \n\nI was 16 but at 6\"4 I looked older. They said I cut my chin by struggling and them having to slam me to the pavement. \nThey gave me a caution at 2 am and released me with no way of getting home. \n\nImagine being that insecure as a middle aged man that you call your mates in to give a 16-year-old a kicking for getting a bit cheeky.",

Made to stand with hands on head with 5 other lads in an outdoor holding area till we all peed ourselves,  it was minus 7 and we had been drinking.  And I gobbed off at a Sargent in a police station and was given the old mattress stomp treatment by four big coppers. No cuts or bruises but boy did it hurt. I'm not a criminal,  never been prosecuted for anything but I'm definitely not a fan of law enforcement.",

He of course didn\u2019t get in any sort of trouble cause this was the late 70s/early 80s but as much as he seemed to be upset he let himself break he always said he would do it again. \n\nI\u2019m not saying this is at all the situation in this video it\u2019s just when I saw him throwing punches on him while on the ground it reminded me of that story and I thought maybe, just maybe, this is the 10th time they\u2019ve showed up and the wife has a black eye and bloody lip. \n\nStill my opinion is cops should keep a calm composure no matter how heinous the crime is.",

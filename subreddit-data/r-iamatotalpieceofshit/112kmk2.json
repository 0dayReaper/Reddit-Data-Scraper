That's how you get like crane shots of the bride walking up the aisle but then on opposite angle the crane isn't there anymore.\n\nThey have to do stuff like walking down the aisle multiple times. It's literally acting / like filming a movie",

Couples are partnered up by \u2018experts\u2019 (though we all know they mis-match people to create more drama) and the premise is they get \u2018married\u2019 and meet each other for the first time at the altar (not a legal marriage, it\u2019s more of a commitment ceremony). The couples then have a \u2018honeymoon\u2019 and then live together and interact with the other couples in the experiment to see if they can make their relationship work and fall in love. It\u2019s basically fast-tracking a relationship, to see if couples can get over their initial judgements and see if when forced to be close to their partner they can form a good relationship.\n\nA lot of couples have stayed together from this show by the way, but of course as the show has grown in popularity it does attract a lot of wannabe influencers and overall just awful people. This season in particular has had not 1 but 2 guys admit they were seeing another girl the week of their \u2018marriage\u2019, this guy included, meaning their partners can\u2019t truly trust their intentions.",

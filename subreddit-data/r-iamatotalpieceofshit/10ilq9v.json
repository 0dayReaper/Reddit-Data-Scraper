I was 19 and living in Long Beach, just outside of LA, when the Rodney King trial verdict came out.  4 of those cops were sent to trial, but they all walked because of the Jury.  They didn't beat him bad enough to kill kim, but it was clearly excessive.   And in a second trial through federal court 2 of the cops were convicted, but only after some significant riots in LA, Long Beach, and Compton.   I'm not sure the cop who killed George Floyd would have gotten convicted if it weren't for the massive nation-wide protests after the footage came out.   \n\nWith that said, even when the department and prosecutors try to hold cop accountable, it still might not happen because of civilian juries.  So I am guessing that the video evidence that we are going to see is so egregious, that these 5 will still get destroyed in court.",

Restrained the exact same way and died of the same causes. Not only this, but he was mocked by the police the entire time they restrained him (essentially killing him). Also, he didn't commit a crime, **he** called 911 on himself for help as he told dispatch he was schizophrenic and hadn't taken his meds. There was no national outcry, no riots or protests, no police reform, no settlements to the family, and the cops didn't lose their jobs. The man literally called for help and was killed for doing so, while Floyd was commiting a crime (and had done so before including holding a gun to a pregnant woman's stomach), and he got a memorial in his honor, truly bizarre",

Almost every major protest against police brutality in the last 40 years has been organized and started by black people in specific response to the disproportionate violence against black people by police. \n\nNon-black people rarely ever mobilize or protest against police brutality in cases like mentioned above or Daniel Shaver or the guy from Colorado who was shot in his car during a wellness check\u2026but you are sitting here wondering why everyone \u201conly cares about violence against black people\u201d. If you want something done about police brutality, start mobilizing and organizing protests for cases like this in your community. Black victims make the news because black people consistently make noise and protest in response to police brutality against black people.",

Floyd and Timpa died from the same form of restraint, but only Floyd had people rioting over him. Meanwhile Floyd, a criminal (gun to pregnant woman, counterfeit money, illicit drug usage) ended up with the cops suffering consequences and literally got a monument, all because of public outcry; whipe Timpa who was *not* a criminal and called on himself for help, did not have public outcry and in turn got no monument, no riots or protests, and the cops suffered no consequences. Setting aside the drastically different aspects of the individuals (with Floyd actually doing something to warrant being detained in the first place, where as Timpa just needed psychological help and called for help), the driving force behind the consequences for the police was because of public opinion.",

I agree though the public behavior is the main reason for the change and convictions. A lot of the recent cases, where white cops have walked, were more due to a jury than the system that's supposed to get rid of bad cops. That's my issue with a lot of this. The cops who get a paid vacation for killing someone shouldn't be allowed to quit when it's time to be interviewed and walk away to the next department to terrorized more people. It's wrong and needs changed. \n\nI am insanely curious whats on the video. Part of me agrees with you. It must be so bad to fire them on the spot before anyone sees it. I don't exactly hope that is right yanno but yeah. The other part of me is thinking about all the other videos that were so horrendous I couldn't understand how the perpetrator was sitting at home getting paid to do nothing by tax payers. They should be in a cell already. That's my worry when this comes out. These men weren't arrested or charged with anything yet either were they? That's still shitty. For a cop to be walking around when there's video evidence of them doing that to a man. The whole system needs to be redone. It's all a mess",

They killed that man and continued being taught how to police by a murderer. If a citizen had acted the same way in public in front of several people they would have been shot or yanked off of him and arrested. Police get way too much freedom. \n\nThat case did show some change of at least charging him correctly for killing Floyd. I feel like it only happened due to the civil unrest it caused. Also if they had not gone to prison there was a high likelihood they would have been rehired when things calm down. There was serious concern all of them could have walked. That case was a much better result, but it's one case out of many that didn't end so well. Yes that case did hold them accountable but it was more society than the police department holding their own responsibile IMO.",

They cannot change that about themselves, that's why it is wrong to judge them based on that. They are simply human and not a monolith.\n\nPolice have made a choice to be what they are. And honestly, if you have spoken to one cop or another, they act as a monolith. Defending even the most brutal police murders, thinking that police cover ups are ok.\n\nI know plenty of cops, one of my best friends is a cop, but when it comes to anything law or police related, they see fucking red.\n\nLaw enforcement, specifically in America, attracts and encourages bullies and egotistical maniacs. They are taught through practice that they will never receive any real consequences for their actions\\*.\n\n\\*someone will comment and say \"but these officers got fired\". Yeah, and they won't be charged with murder, they won't be able to be sued, and they will get a job a few towns over. That's just how it works, if the police union doesn't get them their jobs back.",

Literally all of American society walks on eggshells as to not be racist and you guys still complain it's systemic racism when it's literally just people not liking stereotypical behavior and making fully rational decisions based on that.\n\nWe do indeed live in a system that is inherently competitive and that is the basis of our economy. There is *systemic prejudice* by design, but race itself is not a factor. Individuals are racist, our institutions are not, for all of their other faults.",

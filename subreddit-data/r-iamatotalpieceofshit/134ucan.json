She went to grab it and the lady behind her bent down and grabbed it right before my sister could. She was like eight at the time so she was super bummed.\n\nI get that kids should be excited for this stuff, but a grown woman doing that is ridiculous. It\u2019s like a 75 cent piece of plastic. What do you gain from getting one, especially when you take it away from a child.",

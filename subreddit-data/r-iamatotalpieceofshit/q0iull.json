He's taken pictures of me in the shower when I was a kid, he used to walk into my bedroom bare naked and just talk to me, it was sooo incredibly uncomfortable. He used to get in my face, take his index and middle finger and poke me in the chest and talk down to me. This was decades ago and it only got worse after that. What's the point of all this? My mom's still with him and now he's treating her like shit since I'm not there to pick on. I've cut him out of my life. When he passes, I'm not going to his funeral.",

It was written by a counselor who specializes in working with abusive men. He said one of the scariest and most eye-opening moments was when he put on a skit for some of the men he was working with and asked them to critique the skit for realism.\n\nThe abusers got so into critiquing they didn't realize that they were revealing how premeditated all of their \"impulsive\" actions were. They gave notes like, \"Don't walk over to her, that gives her the power. Don't say anything in that moment, letting her mind fill in the blank is scarier than anything you could do.\"",

I was 16, dislocated his shoulder and knocked his dentures out so hard the top plate shattered on the kitchen floor(he wasn't old, 55ish, just never took care of his teeth). The next time he pulled the \"why I aughta\" shit I asked him if he could afford another another pair of dentures and a chiropractor because this time I would grab one of the stools from the breakfast bar and break it across his back. My big brother(who had sat by and played deaf for years when my dad would kick the shit out of me) told me to calm down, I told him I would calm myself down into his bedroom and stab him in his sleep. Dad never touched me again but psychologically tortured me for the next two years. \n\nPissed off my dad's entire family when I refused to show up at his deathbed, but made damn sure I had rip-roaring legal representation at the will reading. Big bro didn't want me to get anything because I refused to be there at the end, but I still got half the old man's life insurance and his car. Sold the car and donated the money from that and the insurance to a charity for victims of domestic abuse. \n\nPeople like to go on about how important your family is, but sometimes family fucking sucks and it's better to cut it out like cancer. Glad you stood up to that piece of shit &lt;3",

Plus, add in that a lot more young people are staying home longer after their parents would have moved out. Like, they can\u2019t/won\u2019t see how things have changed since 1965 and get mad when they don\u2019t recognize what\u2019s going on. This type of stuff seems to pop up on Reddit somewhat frequently and it all seems to follow the same pattern, you know?  \n\nAnyway, just my armchair theory lol\n\nEdit: based on the variety of responses this got, I feel like I should specify that I wasn\u2019t saying that what happened wasn\u2019t abusive. It was absolutely abusive. No question. That just wasn\u2019t what I was commenting on. I was only commenting on the factors that seem to come together to create this kind of reaction to someone like the streamer making his living that way.",

One guy I work with has a teenage son who streams and plays the game Overwatch competitively for a living and makes really good money. My coworker doesn't really understand it but fully supports it and is making sure his son saves most of it, teaches him about finances, etc.\n\nI think the other factor is guys like the step-father in the video are looking for confrontation so they can feel disrespected and victimized, ie. the way he said \"not in my fuckin' house!\", so that he can react with verbal and physical abuse and still feel like he's in the right.\n\nIn his eyes his step-son sits in his room all day playing video games, talking to strangers, doesn't have a real job, and is now \"talking back\".",

He was way too self-important to do a thing like work. \n\nHe also was about to get arrested for stealing from the fire department, stuff like speakers and lights for his band, thanks to an anonymous tip. So he forced my mom and siblings to pack up and move out of the old four bedroom farmhouse and go 40 miles away to a 2 bedroom trailer in a trailer park near Gary, Indiana. \n\nThis made my mom wake the fuck up and leave him, and we eventually mended our relationship.",

Tbh it fucked me up so badly that from my kid's age of like 10 to now (she's 17), I have refused to get into a relationship, just in case.",

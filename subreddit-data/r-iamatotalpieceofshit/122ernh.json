He\u2019s gonna walk, no charges, with 99% certainty.\n\nShe could probably pursue something if she\u2019s willing to spend months of her life, a ton of money, and to tolerate all the online abuse that will definitely come her way during the process, but victims generally don\u2019t do that. In russia the police usually tell you, quote, \u201ccall us when he kills you\u201d. There is a higher chance for the guy to kill her during the trial than for him to eventually see jail time.\n\nSo yeah, no. He\u2019s walking, and possibly kills her later unless she cuts him our of her life and moves elsewhere. There is no good ending to this story.",

He'd never hit a woman, but his views on other cultures and such was truly something to behold irl. He still lives in my country though so I'm assuming his mentality about Russia changed a bit, but I haven't talked to him since (I walked past him in the store three days ago, that's how I know he still lives here).",

It wasn\u2019t clear to her that the guy knew her husband, but it\u2019s hard to believe that that didn\u2019t play a part in his reaction. She eventually divorced the guy, but I firmly believe that she regretted her decision. Turns out, her Dad beat her and her sister as children. I think she may have interpreted beatings as affection. She left me because I was too nice to her. Honestly.",

All the while breaking down your self worth/esteem, while proclaiming how lucky you are that they stay with you, nobody else would. Every aspect is controlled, it's insidious, they don't wake up one day acting like this, it's a slow progression of breaking you down. It's heartbreaking, hope anyone in that situation reaches out to old friends/family, formulate an escape plan. I stayed for 3yrs, had it one day, I tasted my own blood after he smashed my face off my car trunk, grabbed him by the hair threw haymakers, I broke his nose, split his eyebrow in my rage told him \" touch me again, I'll fucking kill you \".

You start believing you're worthless, like they repeatedly tell you, nobody else would stay with you due to your incompetence, how stupid you are, etc. I remember my ex's mother was trying to excuse his behavior because \" he watched his father beat her ass, it's all he knows \". Instead of breaking the cycle and encouraging therapy, trying to justify it. The mental gymnastics some folks do, they should be in the Olympics. \n\nI'm happy she got out. I can't imagine that situation with small children to boot. Folks have that mindset of \"keep the family together for the kids\" unfortunate mistake many make. It's a volatile, abusive dynamic that is sadly done with the best of intentions and detriment to the victim of the abuse. That's also interesting that he supposedly doesn't abuse his current partner. I'm happy she escaped, gained peace of mind. It's sad how little help there is if you choose to seek it if you're being stalked or terrorized by someone. Cops rarely do anything until you're dead or close to it.",

Of course her father (pre-boomer, born 1929) was a abusive *christian* narcissist and beat her and her siblings too. My father's father was a pill addicted alcoholic korean war veteran. Also beat his children and wife. Yet here I am a product of all of that. Alive and well. Stay strong",

The man who dragged his beloved by the hair worked as a lawyer and, unable to stand the backlash, quit after the video went viral on social networks. This was told by the telegram channel Mash Batash.\nThe fact that the woman herself did not go to the police was also noted by psychologist Rita Dementieva. The expert saw this as a systematic problem for women who suffer from domestic violence.\n\u2014 This is due to a certain learned helplessness and a strengthened feeling that it will not help, plus she will be left alone, - says the expert.\nAccording to Rita, women turn a blind eye to such stories because of fear and self-doubt in the future.\n\u2014 Often such women lack support, and with low self-esteem and insecurity, which are intensified in abusive relationships, they do not have personal psychological resources to change something. Well, in general, such women often have a strong idea that \"you are nobody without a man,\" the psychologist suggests.*\n\nA local news article from a website devoted to discuss events in the city of Ufa.",

A young couple that lived next door to us were are arguing one day after working the fields. He knocked her down and started beating her and dragging her by the hair inside. She used her hands and legs on the door frame to keep him from dragging her inside and i remember her screaming so loud. I started crying and all my family members just walked away and no one helped her. It was very shocking to see for me because my father was always respectful to my mom. He never yelled or her hit her. I had never seen violence like that. \n\nMy parents didn\u2019t even explain to me what happened. I was very scared at first and then confused to why no one helped her. She was the nicest lady. Looking back now I think she was probably only 15 or 16 years old at the time.",

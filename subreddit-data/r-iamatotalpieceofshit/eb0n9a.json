Literally no one in my family gives two shits about whales. I have like stacks of books about whales and encyclopedias to identify wild whale populations. It's always been my dream to see whales in the wild, watching videos of whales swimming on youtube makes me tear up. My older sister adopted me a whale for Christmas one year and it's the only gift that's ever made me cry happy tears. \n\nBut you know, I would have found that trip boring.",

All of our school pictures and sporting event pictures ended up in his back office. \n\nMy grandmother's house (grandma and grandpa separated 30 years ago) had an equal amount of my family and my uncles family. My grandma noticed what my aunt was doing and said it would never happen at her house. \n\nI noticed from a young age that maybe my grandpa didn't like us as much to let her take all of our pictures down. I never understood it. Granted he was a very gullible old man. \n\nAt his funeral his old friends and people he used to work with only thought he had one grandchild instead of 6. They all asked for me by name. They had no idea he has other grandchildren I was the only one he talked about. So that killed me. Apparently my uncles wife gave my grandpa some spiel about how my brothers and I got to take up the living room for 10 years before her kids were born. So it's only be fair if they got all the walls in the living room as well. It's petty as fuck but to an 11-13 year old it hurt.",

She\u2019s from a northern state and in her 90s so she needs extra help and doesn\u2019t tolerate the cold very well, and I live in the south. So we get all of the Christmases with grandma and don\u2019t have to deal with racist aunt or racist cousins. I don\u2019t think things will ever be repaired with my aunt. As much as I would like my mom to have a relationship with her sister, it would take a lot of work and sometimes people just aren\u2019t worth the effort.",

She stayed greedy the whole way through and her kids too. Had a battle with them a few years back to enforce his will. And she still sold off our family farm even though my brother was caring for it still. We saw none of that sale money. The fun part came last year, several years since that fight. It was oil company wanting to buy the mineral rights. Apparently she only had the basic land rights. Turns out my great uncle owned the mineral rights still.",

This lady walks out and hands me an unwrapped $10 bookstore gift card that had HER NAME on it. She clearly just re-gifted it to me at the last minute to save face. Then she turns around and brings in two gigantic tubs full of wrapped presents for my stepsister. One of which was a Nintendo DS and another was a brand new iPod. \n\nThe best part is after it was all said and done she has the balls to look me in the eye and say \u201cyeah sorry about your gift, money was tight this year\u201d. Like I said, not a greedy kid. I didn\u2019t care about the single crappy gift. I did care that my stepfathers family had such obvious disdain for me. My mom was fucking livid.",

We all felt so bad for this sweet little girl, but luckily the other adults in her life could make her summer vacation a bit special. (the girl was invited to the ocean previous times when the grandparents' son and the mom were still together mind you)",

So i go to live with my dad who had his own life, wife and child. My step mother was pressured to be like this by her mother. Her mother told me on several occasions while i was under 10 years old, that she is not my real mother and cant be loved the same as my younger brother who was her legitimate child. So i have a very twisted taste on step parents. In my eyes they are sour that the kid isnt theirs and shouldnt have to pretend they are. Im not suprised to see people act like this. But dont be suprised when that kid grows up to have anger issues and a growing resentment for woman authority figures. This shit causes real life long issues for the children and the parents are to consumed in \"what i want\".",

I imagine she is probably a bitch to him when  her husband isn't around.\nMy dad remarried when I was 12, had 2 more kids. I remember at the time being worried about being replaced etc etc. And to be honest my dad is a much more involved father than he was with me and my older bro, all the credit goes to my step mom for that. As a kid I thought that is something that would make me bitter but it actually makes me really happy to see.\nMy step mom has been nothing but great to me and my brother since the very beginning, she is my family and I love her like I do both my parents. My mom hates that but she is learning to appreciate all the effort my step mom made for us. My mother was also the clich\u00e8 bitter divorcee, with a serious alcoholism problem. She was very loving, but could also be very mean. Used me to much as an emotional support for her various issues and stresses. I was too young to know how to deal with very adult problems. She also shared alot of things she shouldn't have, some I know are true, others not so much, and many were things I kid doesn't need to hear. Not about their parent, not about anyone. It sucks because she refuses to acknowledge any of her behaviour, to grow up and not be able to trust your own mother. To doubt anything she says to you, to not be able to share anything because she will just tell everyone. To not really like the person she is, your own mom. \nBut she's my mom and I love her, she has been good to me in alot of other ways. You got to help support your parents when they have no one else (barring some form of abuse mind you).\n\nMy step mom  always made sure that me and my bro were included, even though we lived  about 300km away. I credit her for even still having a relationship with my dad because their were some really, really rocky times. Plus I know how stubborn my dad is, I just know she pushed him to make peace and reconnect. She still pushes him to be more involved in our lives, to not write off the relationship which is something that was a very real possibility for many years. I also know she has pushed him to change and grow in a lot of ways and has been an amazing mother to my younger brothers.\n\nTo all the kind, loving step mom's out there you are doing a great job. Even if your step kids are snotty teens at the moment just know that passes and they will always remember your love and efforts. I have nothing but respect and love for my step mom, while we didn't live with my dad it couldn't have been easy for her coming into that situation and she handled it amazingly. \n\nKeep up the great work ladies, we all know the stereotype of the wicked step mother, and garbage like the woman here. But those of us with real step moms like yourselves know what you are all about.",

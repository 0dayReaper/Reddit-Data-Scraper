Those lamps are in fact quite old, which is itself good enough proof that design is fine. \nThat is, unless you are a clinical cretin, like the one in the video. \n\nThat's probably one of rather good examples of Western vs Eastern approach: while establishments of the former tend to protect idiots from themselves, as otherwise they will be held liable and sued, resulting in beefy compensation payout and other problems \u2013 the latter would actually sue the one who caused the havoc to cover all the inconvenience and expenses, as it was done intentionally.\n\nThe only point I would agree on is that idiots' actions could lead to harm to other people, which is not okay at all. But then again, the idiot in question and not the establishment would be held guilty of that, and I believe this is correct thing to do. Overprotection of stupid people does not make any good, it only results in then finding new ways to do even more stupid things.",

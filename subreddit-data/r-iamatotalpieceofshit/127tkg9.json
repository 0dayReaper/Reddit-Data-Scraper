One guy was angry that almost gridlock traffic wasn't going fast enough and nearly rammed cars out of his way, hanging from the window screaming with middle finger raised high. A woman reached for a hand basket at the store and had to wait a MILLISECOND while someone else reached for one first, she lost her mind over that lost nothingness. *People are angry* and we're a hair trigger away from absolute anarchy over their falsley-perceived hurt fee-fees.\n\nThey should teach emotion management in school, this can only be stopped through education and self awareness. Genuine rage is not a healthy emotion to lose control of once each decade, let alone *daily*.",

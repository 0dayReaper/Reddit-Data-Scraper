It just has to mean something to its audience or its maker. If the stuff means nothing but money to the maker, that's fine so long as the audience gets something out of it. If neither get anything out of it, it's still art, it's just really crap art.",

I was hanging out at a bar while this kid was terrorizing the outside furniture; kicking over chairs and shit. Kid eventually takes his backpack and starts slamming it into the pane glass window of the establishment over and over. I barge and and yell \"Hey! What the fuck!\" and the \"adults\" that were with the kid were like \"Was that really necessary?\" I responded \"Yes! I think it fucking was!\"\n\nThey are unrepentant in raising their little fuck trophies as the most useless human being they can possibly be while trying to shield them from any sense of responsibility for their actions along the way.",

Since she was 2 years old she was allowed to make her own choices and her mom would not say anything if she did something wrong. She told me that it allows a child to blosa ol m on their own and learn from their own mistakes and allows them to find things in life they enjoy instead of pushing activities on them\n\nHe daughter's has been in jail for a year now for dealing a d using heroin and robbing people because to her she was brought up that there shouldn't be any consequences.  Momma taught her so. Such a shame that the kids in this video are the ones that will struggle later in life not having been taught proper behavior and that whatever they do or break, it's all ok. Momma will visit them in jail.\n\n(I know that it's not necessarily true that these children will grow up like my high school friends daughter,  but not teaching them how to act or respect other people's things will not raise well adjusted adults, in general)",

She guided these strangers by making sure they knew her daughter was just expressing herself at 2-3 years old. I must say, the last ounce of respect for her went out the window the day she let her kid kick my window in the car, almost breaking it. When I told the kid to stop it, she got mad at me for forcing rules onto her precious child that obviously had good reason for the choice she made of kicking my car window from the inside. Her kid was 8 or so by then. Well, fuck that.  Raise your kid how you want but it starts trashing my shit, it's on. 8 years old or not.",

Yeah I've definitely seen how much strict harsh parenting can create all sorts of problems for a kid's development into a healthy adult. So that's where my focus usually goes...they need more freedom!\n\nThe few occasions I've actually spent time with parents who use this approach though it's been terrifying...went shopping with one of my friends recently and i remember subtly watching her kids out of the corner of my eye because she would let them run wherever they wanted around the supermarket.\n\nA few minutes later the little girl is running toward the doors to play with the traffic. Busy main road. I had to sprint to stop her getting outside, got back panting and it was all a big joke. The little girl had no idea of the dangers so was giggling and the mum was laughing along with her. Not a single 'keep away from roads', not even the odd 'if you want to keep that cute little face don't try and hug an oncoming truck', nothing.\n\nThere are limits to the mistakes you can expect a kid to make for themselves. A dead kid due to negligence will always be your mistake, not theirs.",

When you go to someone's house, even a good friends house, the normal thing everyone does is sit very gently on the edge of a seat and don't touch anything until they say something like \"sit back, relax, you want a drink?\". You don't even enter without asking first if you have to take your shoes and coat off. You don't relax like it's your own home. You don't get up and walk around snooping. You take up as little space as possible with your body until it's permitted to relax once the host says so. That's what normal polite people do. And that's so different to what these kids at your house were doing it's not even the same category\n  \nIt's the equivalent of them climbing up onto your car, and jumping up and down on the hood, making dents, and then using keys to scratch the paint off.\n  \nThat's a never-talk-again scenario and I'd be mad at my mum too for not warning me about her friend.",

Kids have a natural instinct to play and explore their environment, as young as babies they're trying to put everything in their mouth and touch things they're not supposed to. It's incumbent on the parent to teach them about the work that goes into art and other people's property, and prevent them from doing it. Your kids are well behaved because you raised them that way, but I can't blame these kids at all for their mom not teaching the right.",

She definitely would've whooped my ass if it was something to this degree, but sometimes, Asian moms really don't give a fuck about rules and it pisses me off.

They usually takes groups of about 15-20 people per guide. A couple of families traveling together with about 6 or 7 kids were in our group.  \n\nThe adults were rude and would talk to each other over the tour guide while the guide was explaining things to the rest of the group. On top of that the parents let the kids run wild like it was a play ground.  I\u2019m not sure if anyone reading this has ever been there, but this castle is filled with valuable antique furniture, paintings and sculptures that could easily be in a museum. These kids were crossing all the barriers, putting their hands on paintings and jumping on furniture, climbing on tables and the parents would only say something when it was time to move along to go to the next area. \n\nThe tour guide was getting visibly upset and was telling the parents to control their kids, at first the parents acted like they could not understand them as English was not their first language. After the guide warned them that they will be kicked out, they finally took control of the children. \n\nThat was the most outrageous display of shitty parenting I had ever seen.",

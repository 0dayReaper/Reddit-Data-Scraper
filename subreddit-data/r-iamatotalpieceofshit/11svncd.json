Thankfully never flushing and flooding. Finally able to get some staff to post up and we caught the Stromboli Bandit eventually. The 15 yo boy was given detention with my custodial staff for an hour after school equal to the days until caught this happened. \n\nSo TLDR, this could be worse ... Glad for clean up crew, it isn't.",

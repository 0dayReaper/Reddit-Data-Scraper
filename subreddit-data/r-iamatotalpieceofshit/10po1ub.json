But trying that for a day as an adult will be very uncomfortable because our bodies change, and we get heavier as we age. The same goes for cats &amp; dogs.\n\nIt can however be used as a ground hold if your cat has caught something like a bird - holding the cat by it's scruff on the ground usually will make it let go of the prey animal after a second or two, without biting down to kill their prey, and if they don't let go you can gently lay them over on their side, that always makes them let go.\n\nOf course, this only works with \"your\" cat. Do this with a strange / feral cat, and it will rotate in it's neck skin and savage you. LOL",

Also, people who gift animals need slapped bigtime. Christmas is a terrible time to try to raise a puppy, the weather sucks and it's hard to get them the exercise they need. My dude was born in early June and I brought him home in August, summer is a great time to raise a pup and by the time the weather socks in again they should be properly house trained and have plenty of inhibition about fouling the house just because they don't want to go out in the wet and cold.",

Sure, you can run the risk of the dog having some baggage from a previous bad home, but you know more what you're getting into (size, energy level, coloring, temperament, etc), with many/most already being reasonably housebroken by that age. Additionally, older dogs are almost always much more chill (particularly 5-6 years or older), and often much more appreciative of a good home. Dogs of any age can have problems with submissive urination, poor leash skills, jumping on people, or any number of other bad habits, but most of them are fixable and much easier to do so than with a young, energetic puppy.",

God, they were so annoying the first couple months but they were so cute! The first couple nights, they constantly screamed at night. I'm completely over my disgust of pee and poo after stepping into it countless times.\n\n\nI remember them destroying a lot of blankets, beds, shoes and 1 even nibbled on the wall. There is constant worry while training to leave them alone will lead to some destruction. And ofcourse how to correct their bad behaviors and train them well. Puppies are a lot of work. Luckily they turned out well adjusted. I think if I was living alone, I would opt for adopting elderly dogs.",

She\u2019s super smart and extremely food motivated, so we are adding in some fun tricks like spin and crawl. Constantly reinforcing her sit, lay down (she haaaaates it), here, etc. totally worth it though. \n\nI\u2019m gonna brag here, I\u2019ve had two times where I\u2019ve had to recall her because of other people\u2019s dogs and she\u2019s listened perfectly even though they were exciting/scary situations. First was at a large off leash dog park. We just got in and she was running up to a lady with a pitbull leashed who was walking towards us. The lady screamed no at me like panicked like her dog wasn\u2019t friendly. Normally Shiloh gets very excited to meet other dogs and doesn\u2019t listen. Called her back and she was right next to me in an instant. Other time a guys cattle dog started to aggressively herd her(loud snapping at her ankles and growling). She started to panic and tried to book it away, called her and she was right back at my side. So freaking proud of her. Lots of work to get there though!",

You need to be fully invested and experienced with training when it comes to huskies.  Those dogs are known to not be food motivated so you have to go to the next step.  Many average dog owners don\u2019t bother to do that and then you have a problem on your hands.  Shelters are a haven for disobedient dogs that their previous owners gave up on and here comes the new owner who has no idea what the dog has been through and can once again repeat the cycle if they are not on it.",

Minor offences escalate and people become desensitised to violence. Obviously theft shouldn't ever be a capital crime, however there should eventually be some recognition that someone has irreversibly revoked the social contract to such an extent that thy cannot be a part of it any longer.\n\nEven \"minor\" crimes like burglary take a huge psychological toll on the victims, not to mention \"lesser\" sexual crimes like public groping. There comes a point that the suffering caused by someone adds up, and that person has clearly demonstrated their inability to live alongside others without causing them harm.",

So she is either holding these people to milk them for their government checks, or one of you is full of it.  If they're in Hospice there should not have been a Paramedic attempting any time of formal resuscitation.  \n\nNot that I haven't had multiple occasions of family members demonstrating literally *no* grasp of what it means to be on 'hospice'.

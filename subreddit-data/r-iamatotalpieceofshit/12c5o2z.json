It starts with yelling, demeaning you, throwing things at walls, then at you, pulling you around when you don't want to, pushing you to the ground, slapping you, punching and choking. Then it's only a matter of time before they snap and finish you. My ex always said I made him do it and that it's my fault he did it. I had the luck that someone anonymously told the police. Then he told me it's not working, broke up with me and almost threw me out. Well he couldn't because the police were lurking around. I probably wouldn't be here if that person wouldn't have told the police. \n\nFor anyone reading, if you see anything suspicious ALWAYS  report it. Even if it's anonymously.",

The police came and I bottled but a lovely officer noticed I was incredibly scared and spoke to her and we ended up making a plan of send her diaries of what things have happened inc photos. They came on Monday and arrested but unlike last time has been bailed under investigation. He's breached bail at least 6x calling my neighbour trying to contact me through them which is ENTIRELY the polices fault. They took his phone for evidence and then allowed him to write phone numbers down but not check if they were necessary for him to have! Waiting to give interview evidence for the case myself. I'm just hoping for a positive outcome. I want him held accountable for the trauma he's caused me and so that no other woman is hurt by him.",

My mom and his mom were close friends and it first took a couple of months to even convince her to leave him. \n\nAfter that it took a few weeks of planning and already slowly moving belongings out of the house to our place. A lot of the planning surrounded letting our building security and school know about the dad to minimise any chance of a kidnapping. Another part of planning, was planning the day of the move out itself and making sure there was a couple of hours with the house to themselves to pack up. \n\nAfter that it was months of dealing with the dad, trying to come around, trying to call, threats, etc. Meanwhile, we had to figure out how to set up my friend and his mom in a new city where they couldn\u2019t be found. \n\nThat being said, for us this was still quite easy as we lived in a gated community and our school was also heavily secured. \n\nI don\u2019t want to imagine how difficult such a situation would be if it\u2019s just you and your child.",

Through life\u2019s ups and downs, and day to day stress, we made it a point to work together and shield our kids from negativity. We have a 5 month old that is a bundle of joy and is constantly smiling, he started giggling about a month ago\u2026. I believe he is a happy baby because all he has ever known is his family\u2019s love. If you are reading this and have a baby or are expecting soon, remember, they aren\u2019t small forever, and they won\u2019t be innocent forever. Enjoy the hell out of them, show them love, and most important model love to them by loving your spouse. Life is so much better that way.",

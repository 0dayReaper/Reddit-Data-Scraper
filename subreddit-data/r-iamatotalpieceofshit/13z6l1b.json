His \u201cGod\u201d is the most hypocritical in nature and it reflects in this dudes own beliefs and lifestyle. The gay porn and trans stuff I find no issue w, dude just needs to accept who he is; BUT I DIDNT KNOW HE WAS AN ADMITTED PEDO. If that\u2019s true and he\u2019s not just saying it to b edgy, his audience/tiktok followers are just as much pos as he is. \n\nJust wanna say tho, I do believe there are good Christians and respectful ways to practice whatever you\u2019re beliefs are. This dude and his posee however get no pity from me if they end up in the obituaries",

Religion itself isn't inherently wrong but its a lot like most things on society where most people handle it fine while a couple of people make us write entire books of law to keep them in check, except religion doesn't keep them in check. You tell people that god is inside of you and guiding you and suddenly they feel empowered to act on anything that they think is gods guiding hand, except its mental illness guiding their hand. Lots of people become mentally ill without religion and \"crazy\" people don't think they are crazy generally but when you grow up indoctrinated in this way, there is zero barrier, while someone not raised in religion has at least some potential barrier to seek help. I.e. \"im hearing voices in my head\" to a religious person \"its definitively god\" non religious person \"its probably some magical essence controlling me!

It was never brought up again and she treated me no differently. A huge portion of religious people are garbage but many of them are not.",

Honestly, some of the best people in the world go to church to interact with others who just want to spread positivity and good words.

Always be watching out because you never know if the person you\u2019re speaking to is one of them in disguise, and their tactics are very subtle\u201d. They are going to ramp up your paranoia. \n\nThen, after years of constantly stoking that fire in your mind, they convince you it\u2019s time to stop letting the other county walk all over you. You\u2019re going to feel more okay with trying to destroy the other county in whatever way you can, because you truly believe you\u2019re just giving them a taste of their own medicine. \n\n\nThe most important aspect of this is that \u201csneaky\u201d has to be extremely vague. If they define specific threats and events, you can quantify those in your mind and realize they\u2019re lying to you. But if you believe it\u2019s extremely hard to identify exactly what they\u2019re doing, you\u2019ll think every cracking twig is part of it. \n\n\nIt\u2019s all Russian psyops meant to confuse and radicalize against an enemy that is, by all accounts, actually innocent. \n\nNow. Replace \u201csneaky\u201d with \u201cwoke\u201d and \u201ccounty\u201d with \u201cparty\u201d\n\n\nEdit: spelling",

Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. \u201cAnd when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others.",

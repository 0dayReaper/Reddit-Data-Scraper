If you dropped to a C at any point during the year, you were sent to alternative school and taken off the public school roster. \n\nThat\u2019s how my high school has the best scores in the state - because they remove all their average and below students. By the time the school claims how much money they raised in scholarships and what their* test scores are, they\u2019ve broken the curve by just removing the lower half of data. Fucking disgusting tactics.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the upvotes! I reported it to our State Board and never heard anything else, and I just looked up some current stats for my old school. Graduation rate of 99% compared to the County AVG of 82%, and a State AVG of 90%? Hmm, wonder what's going on here..\n\nEDIT2: Also, apparently this is almost the exact plot of \"Pump up the Volume\" with Christian Slater. Which is funny and terrible, because life really does imitate art.",

One time we were done at 9.45pm and my boss chewed me why I didnt clock out. \"I was restocking the shelfs\" was not a valid reason.\nNext day it was the same thing, she came to me said go clock out and come back down and finish the job.\nShe gave me even more crap when I said \"when I clock out im going home not back to restocking\"\n\nSo happy I dont work there anymore.",

When I used to work in retail, I would leave when my rostered finish time came around, regardless of whether there were still customers in the store or not. I used to park out the customer entrance rather than the staff entrance because I got sick of waiting ~15 minutes unpaid for that door to be opened. My manager told me off saying I couldn\u2019t leave until all customers were gone. When I said that was fine, so long as I was paid for that time, he said \u2018oh consider that making up for all the times you\u2019re late\u2019. It was quite satisfying looking him in the eyes and saying \u2018if you can show I have ever been late, then fine\u2019 knowing full well that in my five years at the store, not once had I clocked in even a minute late. \n\nI continued leaving exactly on time for the rest of my time at that hell hole",

This employee was not terminated, but did resign in May 2016.\n\nWhile we understand that this video is receiving a great deal of attention on social media, it is important to distinguish that the conversations on social media do not fully reflect all the facts of this situation. Our HR professionals have begun a review of this matter in its entirety. Fulton County Schools has approximately 14,000 employees and we greatly value all of them.\u201d",

            "comment": "Years ago there was a HR manager lady who had a reputation of being a right powerlord (she marched about with her chest pouted out and dressed and looked like if Nanny from Count Duckula was in the Devil Wears Prada). She called me to a meeting at her desk in front of every team on a call centre floor  (on that day about 200+ staff in) and screamed blue murder at me repeatedly screaming \"OHH NICE ONE!\" because I emailed one of her staff a reply. They'd asked me to attend an out of office hours meeting to meet some training people and I replied with \"Ohhh nice one, can't make that. Am off that day sorry, unfortunately I cannot attend.\"\n\nAfter she'd screamed about me speaking to her staff like a piece of shit and a few other choice words, I realised everyone around us who was trying to work had stopped what they were doing and were looking over at my shocked face.\n\nSo I thought fuck this, smiled and replied \"Do you think you may be.. Ohhh.. blowing this all a bit out of proportion?\"\n\n\"I'M NOT BLOWING THIS OUT OF PROPORTION! BLAH BLAH SOMETHING SOMETHING...\" I'd stopped listening at this point and sat back smiling happily. After a few more minutes I politely asked if she was finished and walked back to my team laughing.\n\nA few weeks later she was power-walking past my desk while I was on a call and stood on a small  circular air vent near me on the floor. Unfortunately she was in high heels and she wasn't a subtle person; either the heels were going to explode or the vent would and on that day the heel was victorious, snapping straight through the floorboards with her leg following and making her other leg slide out at 90 degrees, like a fatty sun dial where she was stuck for 2 minutes while a few people tried to help her out. I must've laughed myself to sleep that night.",

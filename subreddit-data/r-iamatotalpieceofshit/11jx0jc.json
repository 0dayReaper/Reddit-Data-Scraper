When approaching an intersection you still always stop because the lights and sirens dont give other cars the ability to stop AND even more importantly they might not be the only ambulance responding, there could be other police or fire vehicles as well. Where I worked as an EMT for years our ambulances had a PA system so in a case like this we could yell \u201c DO NOT CROSS STAY BACK MORONS \u201c lol",

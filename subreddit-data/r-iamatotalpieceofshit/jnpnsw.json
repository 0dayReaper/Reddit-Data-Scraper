It's better that people understand that they're doing something inherently dangerous, and are prepared to face the consequences.\n\nI feel the problem with American football is ironically the armour. When you're padded to the nines, you can feel invincible, that's just the human brain at work. Hell, I feel ten times tougher even wearing a hardhat or a bike helmet. That leads to them charging each other harder and harder, which is spectacular to watch on occasion, but it's always always gonna be hella dangerous.\n\nKinda like how boxing became more dangerous after the gloves were brought in. The damage that's taken off their knuckles is translated directly to the other guy's face. You'll hold back a lot less when your knuckles aren't at risk of breaking.",

Obviously what the Moore did was unconscionable, but I'm having trouble understanding why as a dance teacher you would take young people out to the downtown area near the bar to dance on the street corner so late at night. These kids aren't much older than my own and I'd have a hard rationalizing letting my kid do this. At a dance performance at a location designated for competition that might go into the night? Yes sure. I get this is supposed to be urban dance experience but is it necessary? Even as a large middle aged man, I watch my back anywhere out in public areas like this just from personal experience that the general public is full of whack jobs and shit like this happens constantly. As a teenager I had constant trouble in my neighborhood just trying to walk from A to B from people spitting on me from cars, and people yelling degrading things from their homes, trying to run me over with their cars etc.",

And maybe dancing under supervision of an adult dance instructor is better than what he could otherwise be doing.  \n   \nI dunno. I mean, I get that we have to be vigilant for our own safety, but perhaps there's something wrong if neighbourhoods aren't safe. Promoting culture, unity, and healthy youth engagement through creative activities is a great way to start improving neighbourhoods.",

Nonetheless nowadays in their 20s some of them are working delivering food on motorbikes in the freezing cold of winter, others work construction in the heat of Greece in the summer and I know of some who are stealing and doing all kind of that stuff to get by.. \nDefinitely got what they had coming for them in one way or the other. I still felt kinda sad for them when I saw them, moreover since the cause of all this was more a fault of their parents and how they treated these kids..\n\nAlso don't wanna devalue or undermine the importance if these jobs, especially construction, but it is a hell of a hard job to do - more so if you haven't chosen to do it by yourself and it's only out of necessity.",

I think you're more likely to get some help and advice from someone who works with abandoned and abused animals IN YOUR TOWN and maybe they can connect you with an animal control officer who is more motivated to help you than that cop was.\n\nAlso, there is no way that I could watch that video, so I am not really in a position to comment on if it is enough to arrest and convict someone, but it sure seems like enough to investigate.",

I'm not saying it excuses his actions, at all. Yes he deserves punishment and consequences for doing that. I didn't say he didn't. Not at all. But it's still mental illness/instability at the end of the day. And it needs to be understood and treated, as best as we can.  Because it becomes a cycle of abuse, it's the root cause. \n\nWhich means it absolutely is NOT a myth that a lot child sexual abuse perpetrators were molested themselves as a child. Absolutely not. It's estimated at least somewhere around 70 percent of them were. And that's just going off the ones comfortable enough to admit to that. Because double standards exist in certain situations doesn't mean to ignore FACTS.  There's also a double standard that rears its head in a lot of cases with a female teacher molesting a student. Does that mean the kid is any less a victim? Or the teacher not suffering from mental illness/instabilty herself, which could have stemmed from abuse she endured herself? No, of course not.  It's just fucking stupid to think in that way.",

On campus, Indiana University is not conservative, out on the town, Bloomington is very conservative and it is very obvious. But I do agree, you can easily put yourself in a bubble in Bloomington.",

Besides larger counties in the southern part of the state na couple towards the north, it's mostly conservative and has been since I was born I believe. Lotta folks are trumpies n fly the Confederate flag around here. AA, most parts of metro Detroit n down river, n most college areas vote blue but everywhere else is p red, especially the wealthier areas where it's mostly rich folks that all look the same. Sorry for the wall of text, just wanted to letcha know that most places outside of cities are not liberal in Michigan",

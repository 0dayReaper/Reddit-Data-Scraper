The woman had just got off a flight agitated and claimed the Uber driver attacked her dogs when in reality, she was upset that her luggage didn't fit in the car with his stuff. She was overhead saying she was tired and \" Just wanted to go home\". The footage was submitted to both LAX P.D. and Uber. She may go to jail but for now Uber has frozen her account and it's implied she will be banned from the app.",

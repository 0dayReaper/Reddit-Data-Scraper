He begins frantically mumbling about how I'm the only person in his life keeping him grounded otherwise he would have ended it all, then it slowly shifts into how he wanted to \"take me with him at the end of this road\". I start to panic because it turns from low mumbles to deranged yelling. I was crying, and all he could do was laugh at my fear. He decided to make it even scarier for me by grabbing a pocket knife from the dashboard and pointing it at my neck. All while he was driving over 100. \n\nSuddenly, he slams on the brakes and just stops. No words were spoken, just silence. He resumes going at only 40 the rest of the way back to my home. He drops me off, says he'll see me tomorrow, then leaves. I puked in my front lawn. When I confronted him about it, he just said it was for fun and he would never actually do anything.",

Each one happened to someone I know on FB, or heard the story later from other friends, when it all went wrong. \n\nStay away from these fools.",

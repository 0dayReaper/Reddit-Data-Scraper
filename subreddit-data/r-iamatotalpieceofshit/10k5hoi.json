Maybe they get a couple years because of the mediatization of the trial.\n\nThe a**ctual perpetrators of the crime**, (one, maybe two of them) **MAY** get the maximum of 35 years in prison. Highly unlikely.\n\nThe media is just trying to seize all the indignation and making up impossible scenarios of exaggerated penalties, that people believe without the tiniest bit of knowledge.",

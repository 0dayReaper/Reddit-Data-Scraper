I'm 27 so it's not like they're just starting out either. My mom had had 2 of her 3 kids by that age and had a house for 2 or 3 years. \n\nMy mother is amazing and has never pressured me to have children and my partner and I don't want to regardless of our financial situation, but it makes me so sad to know that our friends could have had the lives they wanted but can't because of .... Well because of all of it. Student debt, climate change, wage stagnation, inflation, housing prices, college prices, grocery prices, and a thousand other things. \n\nIndividually, most of these problems are surmountable. But the younger people in our country are just being crushed by all of those problems at the same God damned time. I used to want kids too. I've changed my mind but I'd be lying if I said the cost didn't factor into it a little bit at least.",

Throughout history humans have proven they are capable of doing either of those while in any level of power.",

I guess I didn't technically work for them, though, because every worker they brought in for that specific job was classified as an independent contractor. My job was 'asset tracking' - basically, every person working on decontamination sites and every piece of equipment had a barcode and my job was to scan the barcode when they entered and left the property (I guess it was to help track cross-contamination? I wasn't really sure). It paid really well. I was flown out there and got paid $25/hour with 1.5x on Saturdays and 2x on Sundays plus a rental car and gas, a per diem for food, and a hotel room. \n\nI mostly worked the night shift from 6pm-7am when virtually nobody came in or out. I essentially got paid $11k to sit in my car and watch movies for a month.\n\nHere's the thing, though - I had absolutely no training in environmental health or epidemiology or anything like that. I got that job because I was between jobs at the time an had a friend who worked at their corporate office. They had hundreds of people like me working at all of the farms that were affected. These cleanup/monitoring contracts must be EXTREMELY lucrative if they're able to pay hundreds of people that much money to just scan equipment barcodes.",

It documents George\u2019s life, his transformation from clean cut TV comedian to counterculture icon, the dark problems in his marraige related to addiction, his \u201c7 dirty words\u201d and the subsequent battle with the FCC, his waning years in the 70\u2019s, and his revival to the George we know and love to day, starting in the 80\u2019s till his death.   \n\nIt\u2019s totally worth the watch. It has a lot of unseen/rare footage. Great documentary, directed by Judd Apatow and Micheal Bonfiglio. It even won an Emmy in 2022. \n\nIf you a die-hard fan like me, if you merely only seen a couple excepts of his routines, or even if you don\u2019t know who he is, it\u2019s a great and captivating documentary. It features great comedians he influenced like Bill Burr, Jon Stewart, Stephen Cobert, Bette Midler, and many others.",

So, in the absence of regulation, the only thing curbing corporate greed is the threat of repercussions that affect their bottom line.\n\nSo, where we might intuitively understand that a manufacturer dumping waste chemicals into a river behind their factory is bad, they see it as cost saving as the river sweeps the problem away and makes it someone else's issue to deal with. \n\nIt's not until those people down stream sue and win that the company decides to make changes.\n\nWith regulation, we can proactively curb a lot of these greedy behaviors, but without regulation, Capitalism is 100% reactionary.",

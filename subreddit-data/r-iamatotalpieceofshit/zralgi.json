I doubt this is potable water, but it could definitely be used for kitchen sinks, and showers inside of the recreational vehicle. Just an educated guess.\n\nEdit: also, I believe they make the pump spout a different size than gasoline tank openings so that it will not fit into the tank. It will only fit in a water tank or some thing that has an abnormally large opening.",

It's not like other terminal diseases where the body fails. Seeing what I've seen in my family, I can't judge anyone who moves on from a spouse with dementia. \n\nOften dementia patients remain in relatively good physical health, but with little to no cognition. And they can remain in that state for years, wondering around in circles, moaning and bouncing off windows but with no concept of who, what or where they are, like the walking dead. Eventually they loose the ability to walk and they slowly decline into a vegetative state, which can last for more years. A well cared for dementia sufferer can survive for over a decade with no ability to look after themselves and no recognition of those most important to them, like children and spouses. No one should expect their family to suffer by their side through that. Dementia is truly a fate worse than death, they are the literal undead. \n\nAs far as I am concerned when I am diagnosed with dementia and can no longer recognise my wife and child then I am effectively dead. It might take my body a few torturous years to realise the fact, but I want my family to treat that as my death, mourn for me then move on and live their lives without me.",

There is still great potential for you not to get it and your husband not to as well, but being aware and on top of the possibility is good.

You begin to grieve the loss of the person before they die whether you notice/realize it or not. That means that after they have passed, you've already gone through the worst of it and that brings on a lot of guilt. People wonder why they don't feel as sad as they think they should, wonder what is wrong with them, and cen even begin to question their own humanity because they aren't feeling devastated. It is normal, and unfortunately people aren't warned about it. It doesn't mean that you are unfeeling or uncaring, it means you have gone through the worst of the grief when the person you loved lost their essence. Losing the shell of the person generally won't trigger the big response that happened when you realized they were no longer there sometimes many years earlier.",

They stayed legally married and living together for a year or two after agreeing to split so she could stay on his insurance and off the streets, so it's not like he was just carelessly abandoning her. But he had to take care of himself first.",

She went through so much crap with me. She said she was afraid she'd come home someday and find me dead. It was a valid concern at the time, and had been for a long time. She didn't leave because she didn't love me. She left for her own sake, and I can't fault her for that. I feel bad. Neither of us knew how to cope with things and were too poor to seek out professional help.\n\nShe ended up remarrying a couple of years later. She has the family she wanted. She's happy, and I'm happy for her. I've since worked through my stuff which has minimized the PTSD symptoms. I only have really bad nightmares now, which is manageable. I've also remarried. We will celebrate 14 years together this year.\n\nBeing left hurt. It would be odd for it not to, really. But I moved past it. Some friends still look at her in a poor light, mostly because I didn't cope well with the loss of stability at the time. I get it. Nobody wants to see their friend hurt, but it really ended up being the best for both of us.",

He said that he wouldn't hesitate to step up and take care of her. I told him that she feels the same way about him and she didn't see him as a burden.\n\nShe was the last person he ever saw when he passed away in a hospice of old age years later.

Dementia, as everyone knows, isn't something you recover from, and it can at best be slowed down slightly medication. It literally destroys the brain matter and reduces a person from whom they once were into a babbling mess. From a practical perspective, the person with dementia just ceases to be and becomes a husk of what they once were.",

If I can't find the resources, I'll take care of it myself. If I had cancer or whatever, fine. I'll fight to survive, but with either of those two conditions, there's no coming back. It's only decline. I'll not have my wife be drained emotionally or financially when I'm no longer myself and would basically be a burden for no good reason.\n\nI'm not saying people with either condition should just go die. I think it's a very personal decision that should be respected. We all have different belief systems, and we all have different expectations of each other. I don't expect for anyone to care for a body that's going much slower than the mind.\n\nThat headline misses context. We don't know what things were like for him. Yes, he's a billionaire. If you let yourself amass that much wealth and aren't doing something positive for society with the bulk of that money, yes, I'll make a lot of assumptions about your integrity and decency. But I won't presume to know what's going on in your personal life. \n\nI've been extremely poor to really well off where I barely even glanced at the checking account because there was enough padding there that things were paid on time and I could cover unexpected expenses without it being a big deal. I still suffered with depression. Having money at least removed a lot of the excess stress in my life. In the case of this guy, there's no amount of money in the world that could bring back his wife. Hell, they may have had an agreement between them. My wife fully knows that if I get one of those conditions, I'm out. She works in healthcare and has seen far too much of both conditions to have any illusions about what the reality of them are. We can't say we know what we'll do in a situation until we're in it.",

My grandmother hasn't been the same person she was for over half a decade. She has not been the same person my grandfather married for possibly longer. Can you imagine being with a person for decades to suddenly need to look after a stranger for the rest of your life? How about also still loving that stranger because of everything you've been through together but having to deal with their sudden decline of mental faculties? Needing to shower them, wipe them after they've gone to the loo, cook every meal for them, etc.\n\nElderly people are also less likely to be willing to spend money, so that plays a massive part of it. I don't blame him for getting mad for forgetting something they've probably told them 100 times that day, or for having to find them for the 10th time that day because they got lost in the home or around the home they've lived in for years.\n\nThere is so much more to dementia than what people think (obviously you know but still.)",

Chief among them chrons disease and rheumatoid arthritis. I lost a ton of weight,.was hospitalized frequently, and was in a ton of pain all the time. My husband proceeded to immediately begin living a second life as soon as I wasn't available for sex whenever he wanted. He basically slept with our entire town, lied about my illness, and when I found out after FIVE YEARS of his lying and stealing my retirement money behind my back, he left. I was just a pretty woman that had a nice house, money, and a nice body he could have sex with frequently. When that stopped, so did he.",

Or in this billionaire's case, I doubt the women involved care. \n\nIn my case, my ex husband lied about everything. He told people I wasn't sick, that I refused to have sex with him, that he owned all of MY things in MY house, that I was lazy and sat on my ass all day (not that I was slowly dying because they couldn't figure out what was wrong with me and that I was in the hospital all the time). He slept with so many women (I found out later) and was even going by a different name. \n\nSo short answer is, they feed their next partners a raft of bullshit. I'm sure whoever he's having sex with now was told a horrific story about me. And not that he tried to kill me for ten years and that I was on antibiotics for two years because of infections he gave me, or that he gave me COVID on purpose in 2020 hoping I'd die and he would be able to take all my things and house, or that he stole $40,000 from my retirement fund or a car from my father with Alzheimer's when he ran away when I finally caught him.",

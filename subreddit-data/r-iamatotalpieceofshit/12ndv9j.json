Since seagulls are native pretty much everywhere this makes it illegal to own a seagull. The law is to discourage people from catching and keeping local wildlife. There are ways around the law, like becoming a licensed rehabilitator for certain animals. Thats how a lot of squirrel owners keep squirrels. \n\nThe law is usually only a misdemeanor and not really enforced except in cases of abuse like this news article.",

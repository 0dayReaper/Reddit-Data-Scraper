Some people have terrible fears because domesticated dogs are not part of their culture.\n\nI know a little girl (about 7 years old) who has been terrified of dogs all her life because she was born in a country where you only see them as strays. She finally warmed up to my boyfriend\u2019s dog\u2026 then one day after school her and her grandma were walking home and a couple dogs that were running loose started jumping all over the little girl. She\u2019s too young and inexperienced to know that they were nice\u2014 all she knew was that they were jumping on her and their claws probably hurt. Now we figure she\u2019ll be scared of them for a long time. Thankfully they didn\u2019t attack her though.",

We don\u2019t know if this dad or son had a previous bad experience with a dog though, which may make them more apprehensive. Or allergies. It honestly doesn\u2019t matter. Dog owner needs to keep control of their animal, especially if someone is clearly not wanting said animal close to them.",

Yeah the dog wanted to play but it seemed like the kid didn\u2019t know that maybe that family doesn\u2019t own pets?? Or maybe the kid has traumatic experience with a dog, nevertheless it looks like the father walks down the corridor a few steps, maybe to say something to the guy about it. So it looks like a lawsuit waiting to happen and it sucks that the dog doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on.. the pup just wanted to play ://\n\nI do want to say for the dog owners in the chat I understand the love and need to protect your pets (especially little pups) after someone hurts them.. but the man in the video just shoved the dog away with his leg. And the dog wasn\u2019t hurt, just ran away looking to play with the next guy around the corner. The owner in this case over-handled the situation which may have put his heart in the right place I don\u2019t know, but it was way too much force for such a mild encounter, now that kid will likely  be afraid of that dog for the fear by proxy of his dad getting punched, or worse, by someone who didn\u2019t handle the first situation reasonably.",

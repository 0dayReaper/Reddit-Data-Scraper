An example of how this could play out: friend had Tiktok for years, it never once showed him boat content, friend starts messaging someone on Whatsapp about boats, suddenly his Tiktok feed is full of boats.  When this happens enough times, it becomes undeniable that it's using more data than you want it to have access to.  \n\nTiktok is basically just malware in a fancy package, and I don't understand how anyone still uses it.  They were proven to have spied on journalists' devices, and likely spy on whoever they feel like whenever they feel like.  It's verging on technological warfare.",

Here's how I remember it:\n\n* turn off gas heat at end of service so that the oil can \"cool\" to the \"you're not so pretty now\" temperature\n* place a massive metal pot on the floor with a conical sieve in it\n* open a screaming hot valve located very, very close to the oil spigot allowing the oil to flow freely into the massive pot\n* Once the fryer is empty, move the pot out of the splash zone and make sure everyone else knows this is essentially lava, then do it again for the second one\n* Close spigot (you've worked 12 hours, it's 35c in the kitchen even after everything is off, you're high, and the girl you like is on a date with someone else because you work weekend nights so you might forget) \n* Scoop all the crud out from the bottom. This is tricky because the gas heats up the metal fins inside the fryer that are not really separated enough to get your hand in between so you have to use a metal spoon down there and guess what? You're burning you hand over and over with hot, oil covered metal.\n* Now fill them with hot, soapy water. Or just water with soap. They are still ripping hot. Take the long tongs and grip a scouring pad in them and start scrubbing. The floor is now covered in oil, soap, and water and you are leaning in. Eventually, you slip and your arm submerges in the scalding water as you pitch forward gripping other hot metal to stop yourself.  Don't use degreaser for this or you'll die from poison fumes, btw. \n* Finding plastic buckets this time you start draining the fryers and refilling with hot water and draining. Do this until there's no soap in there. \n* Now get those bad boys dry. At this point in the night there's no clean towels, that brown paper towel the buy might as well be sheets of plastic because it doesn't absorb anything, and you don't have time for it to steam dry but that is why you keep it hot. No, you look around, make sure no one is watching, and dry it with a clean apron of you can. Gotta make sure you get well into the nooks and crannies. See above, more light burning of skin.\n* Finally, use a smaller pot to scoop the still ripping hot oil into the fryers again, then top it off with fresh oil. \n* You're not done. Now you have to scrub the oil off all those big pots, utensils, and the floor. \n\nPro-tip: soak the apron in the sink, wring out, and hide under other kitchen laundry. \n\nThis was just a tiny fraction of the crap I used to do 5 nights a week when I was a teenager to make minimum wage which was $4.10/hr at the time (Canadian).",

I was the one to catch it and it was kinda comical, even at the time. \n\nMoral of the story, don\u2019t have a 17 year old clean important equipment! \n\nThat said, she usually was pretty responsible from what I remember! \n\nThis situation definitely could have been worse (never ever do this with ice cubes, seriously, it causes major damage all around. Including probably your skin if you choose to avoid this advice.), but it still is potentially really dangerous if you\u2019re flinging hot oil at employees. It also is a straw broom, they catch pretty easy, and while yes it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to catch, straw and wood isn\u2019t a smart thing to put in a fry vat lol",

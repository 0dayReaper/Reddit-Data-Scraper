Platt got in Tenaglia's face or something but nothing physical.\n\n&gt; Platt, who led the Falcons with 16 points, had been called for a  technical foul early in the first half \u2014 from the broadcast, he appeared  to get in a Nichols player\u2019s face after blocking a shot \u2014 and NCAA  rules state a player can be ejected for accumulating two technical fouls  or one Flagrant 2 foul. \n\nThis wasn't just a \"heat of the moment frustration and anger\" move, this was a planned action.  This Platt guy waited for an opportunity and picked his moment to try an deliver the most damage he could.\n\nfuck this guy.",

What\u2019s reasonable changes based on the sport.  In basketball, when you suit up, you don\u2019t imagine getting sucker punched by an opponent so this is outside the scope of risks associated with Basketball and is likely battery (assault is the apprehension of battery, which was probably committed too if the shooter saw the punch coming)\n\nEdit:  I\u2019ve seen that there\u2019s a lively legal discussion about the distinction between battery and assault. I\u2019m neither a criminal nor tort attorney but in case anyone is interested generally speaking assault is the imminent apprehension of harm whereas battery is the actual harm, but note that these definitions may switch depending on your state.  \n\nFWIW: if I was this kid I would not sue unless he suffered permanent damage.  Also, even as bad as this looks, it\u2019s important to remember we don\u2019t have any context here. A fight can happen in basketball in such a way it\u2019s not a civil or criminal assault (think something like a hockey fight where both players want to have at it).  What the defender did was battery, but for all we know he could have been getting elbow cheap shots for 3 quarters and lost his cool.",

Assault is what you would get charged with in a criminal prosecution.\n\nEdit for clarity: this is specific to Texas.\n\nWe also like to be confusing and call what is more widely known as DUI (Driving Under the Influence) instead as DWI (Driving While Intoxicated). \n\nAt least we\u2019re not like that whacko Louisiana with Parishes and Napoleonic Law.",

They harass people until they reach their breaking point, so they can then use force and feel powerful. \n\nYears back my house was broken into while I was home and they had my roommate outside being held at gunpoint. They did not know I was in the house. I called 911 but eventually hung up because someone was at my door. When the cops arrived (6 and a dog), they accused me of being a drug dealer \u2014 apparently the neighbors thought I was so the cops had been casing my place for at least two weeks (there was a white van parked outside across from my house for about that long). Anyway, they never filled a police report. My roommate's car was stolen and they did nothing. He ended up finding his own car and retrieving it, but they still stole other stuff and broke in. The police did absolutely no good. For a while I was convinced the police knew the people who broke into my house. I'm still not fully convinced they didn't have something to do with it. I do not trust police, even the ones that arrested my partner who had assaulted me last year. They kept suggesting things that may have happened, and when I saw the police report and tried to retract that information because it wasn't what I said, they didn't listen and left it in the report.",

They said that she was a \u201cflyer\u201d and was important to the team. I said that she had 2 F\u2019s in violation of their policy and couldn\u2019t go. I also said that as the custodial parent that week I didn\u2019t want her to go and I had a judge\u2019s court order saying that my kids couldn\u2019t go to extracurricular activities with any failing grades. \n\nThe 2 deputies the school had called said they would arrest me if I tried to take my daughter home and they wouldn\u2019t look at the court order. The assistant principal said that my ex wife gave permission for my daughter to go even though she didn\u2019t have custody that week. I couldn\u2019t believe it. My daughter\u2019s bus filled with cheerleaders was sitting in the parking lot while this happened. I didn\u2019t try to go onto the bus because with what had already happened the odds of me successfully getting my daughter home were low without getting beaten or shot in front of my daughter. \n\nThe school later brought her grades up to a B without her having to do any of the missing assignments. They just removed the assignments from the grading equation. Special treatment for the cheerleader. 10 years later my daughter said I was the closest person to her after her two young kids. She doesn\u2019t get along with my ex who always let her get her way. My ex is still an alcoholic. \n\nThe schools always treated me like a mass murderer when I came in even though I was the one who always showed up for parent teacher conferences, lunches with the kids and gave electrical safety demonstrations. I was showed up to be a chaperone for a field trip when a vice principal said he forgot to tell me my background check had expired so I couldn\u2019t be a chaperone and ride on the bus. So much for them wanting involved parents. That was hogwash.",

It was the first time that I experienced discrimination. As a  white man It\u2019s never happened that I know of. It gave me a taste of what it must be like for women and minorities. I didn\u2019t like it. I had to tell them that I\u2019m the one who was involved with my children\u2019s education and homework. I had to bring it to their attention several times. \n\nMy ex wanted my son to get medicine because she thought it was an easy way to deal with my son instead of helping him with his schoolwork. She thought he might have ADHD.\n\nA teacher said that he had the best week of the year the first week he took the new meds and said she thought he should continue with the medication. I said \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were a doctor\u201d and told her that I wasn\u2019t going to continue the medication the next week when I had him. We had 50-50 custody. After the next week she said \u201cHe had the worst week of the year!\u201d and I said \u201cThat\u2019s interesting because I actually gave him the medication\u201d She said \u201cYou set me up!\u201d and I said \u201cYes I did\u201d. \n\nAfter that I had problems with my son\u2019s school. He had a new teacher and I wanted a conference with just the new teacher to see how he was doing without the vice principal adding anything from previous years. The vice principal said he had a right to be there so I said I didn\u2019t want a conference and contacted the principal and she said it would be fine to have a conference with just the teacher. The new teacher said my son was doing fine. The vice principal wasn\u2019t my favorite person and would come in the classroom when I would visit and act like a shark circling the room instead of being supportive of my visits and electrical safety demonstrations. \n\nI would have lunch with my kids because I had a job that allowed me to schedule my lunchtime to match my kid\u2019s lunchtimes so it was fantastic. I got to know their friend\u2019s names and they would say \u201cHi Pat!\u201d or \u201cIs that your dad?\u201d \u201cIs he cool?\u201d. Some teachers would say \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to have a dad go along on the field trip!\u201d and I\u2019d tell them \u201cl\u2019m just another parent\u201d or they would say \u201cWe need more mom\u2019s for our reading program\u201d and I\u2019d have to say \u201cWhat about dads?\u201d It\u2019s like they were stuck in the 1950\u2019s. The vice principal even referred to a classmate of my son\u2019s as \u201ca little colored girl\u201d. Sorry for going on so long. Tell your son to hang in there and keep up the good work!",

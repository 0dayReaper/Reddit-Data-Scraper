But this is someone flaunting the law in a very socially open way as if to invite others into the behaviour.\n\nSo while your statement is true, unless your neighbours is a cop, or someone in child protection, I don't think \"it could be anyone\" is the most salient point here.\n\nIt is the wife of a judge, and she seems pretty open about sharing the fact. That could be a hint of a very serious and pervasive problem.",

When treated that way (as in say, Norway)  - they have far more effective outcomes and lower incidence of recidivism. This is a benefit to society as a whole.\n\nWhen they're treated as a means of punishment or isolation, generally a much worse person comes out at the end, as they have more anxiety and fear, and less healthy outlets or ways to cope. Which is a detriment to society as a whole.",

CPS, school and the hospital all gave the court paperwork stating they full believe he has sexually abused her. 3 yr olds don\u2019t know wtf lube is. Worse things as well. This last hearing the judge was screaming at my daughter that if she didn\u2019t comply he will throw her in jail for a minimum of 6 months and hand the kids ( she has 2 daughters) to CPS while she is in jail. Likely just give the now 4 yr old to the ex. We did some digging and this judge does like to throw the moms in jail for non compliance of visitation regardless of the reason. He said unless her ex is in jail for an offense against his daughter she cannot deny a visit\u2026 even with these letters from authority figures stating he was a danger to her. The whole thing is seriously fucked. Now we have to raise more money, find a way tougher lawyer and try and get jurisdiction established in a new area. We have spent ten of thousands and this case has dragged for over 2 years. He hadn\u2019t seen my granddaughter in almost a year, wasn\u2019t calling, no kind of support and he was treated like he was gold. Absolutely enough to make me wreck my life if it wouldn\u2019t ruin my family.",

To me catching a female pred was a goal, I can't really explain why, but I hope you kinda get it, point being I wasn't biased thinking only men could be like that, I knew it could be both. I did this stuff for maybe 5-7 years and only started seeing legitimate female preds in 2020 post-covid. \n\nI think either A - the lockdowns forced already existing female preds to go online to satiate their desires since they could no longer do it in person or B - being alone and isolated during the pandemic perhaps sparked something in a lot of women that they may not have known was previously there.",

Im a lawyer, I practice in domestic relations, divorce is my job, and the honest truth is it\u2019s pretty 50/50 now a days. I\u2019ve been through enough boring CLEs on the statistics to be pretty confident of that. Sure, I know three lawyers around here who insist it\u2019s not fair and loudly proclaim that to their clients, and 100% of those lawyers rely on being a men\u2019s rights attorney as a marketing gimmick. I\u2019m friendly with them, not an insult, but literally the objective truth - all their firm names are variations on \u201cMen\u2019s rights firm\u201d. Most of the talk these days is just more political grandstanding and appealing to people who feel slighted. \n\nYou wanna know where the real issue comes to play with custody? It\u2019s not gender, it\u2019s money. Especially in custody cases where the parents weren\u2019t married prior, the biggest problem I see is one parent bleeding the other dry financially until they give in.",

Apparently she was bringing home sexual partners while he was away but their children were still in the house. She was arrested at the hotel where she was going to abuse a child with a man claiming it was his daughter but in reality he was an undercover FBI agent. She says she was there to try to save the child, except she showed up with a bag full of lubricant and child size lingerie. I have very little concern that her ex-husband was involved.",

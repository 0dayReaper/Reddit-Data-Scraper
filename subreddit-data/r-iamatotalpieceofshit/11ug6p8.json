She's been attention seeking since before any of this, and she definitely had been making plans for this big performance. Sociopaths don't care what others think of them because they think they're *on another level*, god-like. Everyone else is lesser, irrelevant. That's why they can become killers so easily. \n\nAs a guess, and based solely on what I've read about her, the first direction I'd be looking is some combination of a  narcissistic personality and possibly a histrionic personality disorder. Like I say, though, that's just a guess. She's definitely exhibited signs of both.",

But like, you don't beat yourself in the face with a feckin hammer if you're wired right. That, mixed with the lack of remorse, are textbook signs of severe mental illness. \n\nShould she be punished for ruining the lives of these men? Absolutely. Should she also receive extensive therapy if possible? Absolutely. \n\nMy reasoning for saying this, is she gives real victims a bad name, and a reason to be wrongfully doubted or questioned. But this isn't a normal, well-adjusted person. She is seriously mentally unwell.\n\nImagine beating your own face with a HAMMER.",

My first therapist put me on antipsychotics and mood stabilizers that messed with my heart rhythm and made me drowsy. They also made my highs too high and my lows really low. She actually fired me because me problems were \u201cout of her comfort zone.\u201d\n\nMy second therapist was a dude who believed in family reconciliation and pushed me to do a very slow NC with my mom, and try different meds. He was unsure what I had but thought it must be a mood disorder and something like schizotypal bipolar. My bf wanted me to cut off my mom and get a new therapist, so I did both after she attacked me in my car and called me a pedophile for supporting my gay friend.\n\nMy current therapist encouraged me to get off meds, cut off my mom, and gave me some grounding techniques and lifestyle alterations that have made routine and significant change.\n\nI don\u2019t hallucinate as much (turns out it is mostly triggered by stress and anxiety, not related to schizophrenia), my paranoid thoughts now have a time and place to be mulled over, my anxiety has lessened and is more manageable, and I get sunshine, exercise, and fuel my body better. Im not cured but it\u2019s waaaaaay easier to avoid full meltdowns and I don\u2019t want to KMS anymore. I have more confidence in my boundaries and push myself a litttle bit every day. \n\nMainly I feel better and have prevented myself from running into traumatic situations again, and my therapist works as a checks and balances buddy for me. \n\nAlso she\u2019s avoiding giving me a diagnosis because she doesn\u2019t think it will help me heal, but when I asked months ago she said her initial thought was CPTSD or GAD with Psychotic Depression. All of which can be managed and medicated depending on severity.",

Love that guy! \n\nHis support has been incredibly beneficial and often necessary to continue my relationship boundaries with my family and avoiding taking on the burdens of others to \u201chelp\u201d them. \n\nI thought he may be trying to control me at first, so I was scared to take his advice and listen to his boundaries (get help, stop engaging with my mom or he will have to step away). I really thought it would be a cruel prank and he\u2019d leave after \u201cturning me\u201d on my family (again, paranoia).\n\nHowever, stepping away from my mom and my situation and just trusting him allowed me to fully see what I had been told was \u201cjust in my head\u201d or an \u201cover reaction\u201d was in fact abuse and cult-like behavior. He was right and most importantly, I was right! My childhood instincts and my adult concern was valid! Then I began to work on healing and coping.\n\nSupport isn\u2019t always kindness, but honestly I\u2019ve needed the harsh truths and the \u201cI told you so\u201d now and then. For the most part though, he is attentive to my anxieties and helps me out in kind ways I don\u2019t often realize until I sit and think about them :)",

That being said, I'm a much better person because of therapy, and I like myself a lot more because of it. \n\nTherapy helped me to navigate the deep feelings of shame, guilt and self hatred that come with taking accountability for my flaws, and taught me how to do that again when it comes to it. Now it doesn't take years for me to change a behaviour, I can recognise it and then immediately get to work. \n\nIt taught me how to manage my situations better and have empathy for myself in the meantime. It's showed me how to communicate, how to set a boundary, how to recognise that a situation isn't healthy even if I don't always act on that knowledge. \n\nI've been in therapy on and off for the last ten years. Once I found a therapist that suited me, I've been seeing her for six years now. I go months sometimes without seeing her, then see her regularly for a while when it's needed. It helped me to somewhat healthily deal with the death of my brother, something I wouldn't have been able to do at all a couple years back. \n\nTherapy will get you as far as you're willing to go. Talking helps, but there's a lot more to it than just talking once a week. It's hard work, it's often emotionally exhausting, and it gets really dark. The more you're willing to put into it, the more you get out of it. I went to therapy and didn't actively want to change, and I didn't change. I went back when I was ready to change and really wanted to, no matter how painful or how hard, and I changed a massive amount. I don't hate myself anymore, I don't run from bad feelings or run from shame like I used to. \n\nIt also means committing to finding someone who works well with you, actively searching, trying and evaluating therapists until you find one that you connect with and benefit from. Not all therapists or therapies are made equal, and you're not going to connect with all of them. \n\nTherapy is like a class for your emotional health, if you don't have a good teacher or you don't really want to learn, you can only do so well. But if you have a great teacher who understands your needs that you feel comfortable being vulnerable with, and you are willing and ready to learn, you'll be shocked by what you can gain from it, and how much that changes your relationship with yourself for the better",

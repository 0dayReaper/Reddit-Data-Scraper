Hitting another man like this wouldn\u2019t end well for him physically, socially, or legally, but this is probably one of those cultures where it\u2019s still seen as a husbands \u201cduty\u201d to discipline his wife, and for all we know, he probably felt like he was showing \u201cresponsibility\u201d here in front of everyone else. It\u2019s also important to remember that abusive individuals rarely have emotional problems, and are rather very meticulous and calculated about their abuse. It\u2019s less about them losing a grip on things, and more so using another person/being as a punching bag to deal with multiple stressors when it\u2019s most convenient. And that\u2019s another thing, he didn\u2019t hit her just because she beat him at a silly game. He probably hit her for a ton of other things that didn\u2019t go his way that night, plus whatever else was going on in his life that week. Losing the game was just a convenient excuse in his head. And that\u2019s another important thing to note, because it almost certainly means he\u2019s gonna hit her even when she hasn\u2019t done anything to (in his eyes) \u201cslight\u201d him in the moment.",

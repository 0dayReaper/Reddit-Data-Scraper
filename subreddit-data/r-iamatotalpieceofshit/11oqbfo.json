It started with wrestling competitions in carnivals, eventually it got to a point where several parties involved discovered they could make more money if they exaggerate some aspects of the match and it kept on going and going until we now have modern day professional wrestling. Even up until the 70s, there were several iconic pro-wrestlers like Antonio Inoki and Karl Gotch who trained their students in legitimate martial arts because they believed that someone who legit knows how to fight can believably \"pretend-fight\".",

Anyone who knows how this works can see the other wrestler move away, the ref do a medical check and then the ref signal the other wrestler to end it.",

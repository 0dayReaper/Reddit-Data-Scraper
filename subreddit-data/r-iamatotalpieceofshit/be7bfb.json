But for now, he won. **I** had to move. **I** went to jail. All because I told him to knock it off and he called the cops and told him I was a weed dealer. So when the cops showed up, I had a little but they were pissed off that it wasn\u2019t the pounds he said I had or the loads of cash he said I made from the weed.  Not even this got me a restraining order.\n\nI don\u2019t care that I went to jail really, it\u2019s illegal and I had some. But this fuck gets patted on the back for being a good citizen while sticking his tongue out at me like a childhood bully.",

Honestly, I believe after Eisenhower's speech warning about the military industrial complex pay WW2, that it was (obviously) never heeded. Allowing such a cancer to pervade your culture is putting money before life, and now we're slaves to it, the antithesis of freedom. Anytime a right wing party doesn't like the direction, they call it communism (nevermind most of us are too stupid to recognize socialism vs communism thanks to McCarthyism red scare); and anytime the left doesn't like it, it's called fascism.

That same ex only got a fine as well when he eventually got caught on CCTV and by witnesses beating his ex after me up at a train station and then hiding from the police. Hopefully this wont be the case for OP and it is just like someone else said and depends on the area you live but can see why I've not much faith in our police, still get it reported though OP, it's worth a try at least and heres hoping you have more luck than me",

They really genuinely would love to lose weight, but it is tough once you are stuck with your habits.\n\nCalling someone fat out in public will achieve what? The person will get more depressed and have even less motivation.\n\nLeave it to the medical professionals or people close to the person to talk about health issues.\n\nHarassing someone for their weight is senseless.\n\nBut the other side of things is this. I live in a country where my tax money funds someone's heart surgery.\n\nObesity and cardiovascular diseases are one of the biggest if not the biggest money pit in our tax system alongside our free education system and social security.\n\nWe pay a tremendous amounts of euros to fix up obese people.\n\nStill, leave it to the doctors and lawmakers to decide how to counter obesity in the long run. People are the product of their environment.\n\nCalling someone fat will always make things worse.\nI don't like ultra-plus size models who advocate for being overweight either, but it is everyone's own right to believe what they want.",

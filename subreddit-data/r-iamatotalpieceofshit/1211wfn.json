No matter what part of his body landed first, if it was squared on her spine, face, skull.. it's not like she was bracing for a rehearsed blow in the wwe.\n\nHad a friend break his nose, catching a knee at the river popping up while jumper was going in. There was a lot of blood. \n\nTo me, this is like throwing a brick blindly into a kitchen at that same restaurant. \n\nId be pissed too. It's not like I can react to danger with my fucking legs bound.",

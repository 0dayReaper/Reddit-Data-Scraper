Either way, it's my peeve for small businesses. I'm going to naturally reach for the righthand door when I'm both entering and exiting. That means that if you lock one, no matter what 90% of people are going to have an issue interacting with that door. So bogus, just unlock them both!!!!",

Of course all that stuff is up to endless debate and ultimately is determined by Municipal code. But IBC is typically the guideline and this is compliant and commonplace, to my knowledge, in most of the areas I've visited.",

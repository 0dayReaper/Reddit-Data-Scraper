I\u2019ve also picked up the same husky multiple times. The owner is my neighbor  who has no husky experience and refuses to get a husky proof fence or stop letting him out alone. I\u2019ve also had to call code control over my neighbors Tom cat. Pretty sure he is part of the kitten problem. But the owners claim they can\u2019t fix him (their reasons are insane) and that it\u2019s cruel to keep him inside because it\u2019s \u201cagainst\u201d his \u201cnature\u201d. I call code control because this cat comes on my property and sprays my front price and antagonizes my cat, and I\u2019m now afraid to let my cat use her fenced backyard because I worry this Tom cat will attack her.  He\u2019s mean. My dog used to keep him away but he\u2019s gone.",

One got ran over by a car in front of our house, the other died horribly from drinking antifreeze it came across while outside. Few years later, mom had two cats she allowed outside. Both within a year of each other went outside and simply never came back. Few years later, we move and my grandma tossed outside one of my mom's cats for peeing on the bed after we had recently moved. It never came back. \n\nFive cats throughout my life have been lost directly due to being allowed outside. Now as an adult and allowed to care for my pets how I want, I'm never letting any cats be outside-allowed cats if I ever do get a cat. \n\nThere's simply much more inherent risk and negatives to it, regardless if your cats have been fine outside... so far. \n\nCats are \"happier\" outside when there's lackluster enrichment and engagement inside the home. Give them that, they're perfectly fine AND exponentially safer.",

I have an indoor cat now and he's super spoilt and we play every day. Constantly buying stuff to enrich his environment and he's healthy and happy. My husband kept arguing to let him out but we live near a main road and I tried to explain that when cats die they don't just teleport to your house, they go missing and sometimes you never get that closure. The 1 that died was the sweetest boy, used to steal our bread crusts and hide them in his pop up tent. He went missing for a week and I remember going to school filled with worry for him. Eventually someone found him - he'd been hit by a car and someone had wrapped him up and laid him by the side of the road. My mum let me see him before we buried him and he looked perfect like he was sleeping. I'll always keep my cats indoors.",

I've actually found puppies in a trash bag in a large mudding puddle/lake and they were somehow all still alive. I've found multiple small dogs abandoned and obviously neglected. I've saved multiple birds trapped in various nettings, and I've even found a couple of kittens doused in motor oil by the side of the highway. \n\n\nAnd all that is just what I can remember off the top of my head, I'm sure there's more that I'm forgetting. I grew up off a major highway, 30-45 minutes from almost anything, so it was a prime area for animal abandonment. \n\n\nAlmost all of this was nearly 25 years ago, and even the recent ones, my mind has never been on \"I should film this\" but \"I need to hurry up and help this poor animal.\" All of the wild animals I'd immediately release, if possible, whereas the domesticated, I would either find homes for, a few went to the shelter, and I kept a couple of dogs I'd rescued until they'd passed on.",

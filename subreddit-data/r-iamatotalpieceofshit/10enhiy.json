Regular we will call Bill had his daughter on his bike, who grew up on and around bikes, and they were cruising around. Someone whipped into traffic and cut them off, and impact was imminent. Bill reached behind him and threw his daughter off the bike and was convinced it was the end for him. She survived with scrapes and bruises. He survived but is in constant pain and can barely walk. He's totally and permanently disabled and unable to work. She was younger when it happened, and even as an older teen/young adult, she was a tiny thing. She would have surely died had she hit the car head-on with him.",

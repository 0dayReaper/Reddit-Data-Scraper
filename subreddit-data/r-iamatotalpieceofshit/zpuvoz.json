Nothing is more frightening than someone you love turning to you, looking in your eyes, trying to talk but only gibberish coming out, nothing but primal fear in their eyes, watching their eyes roll back and having to catch them as they fall, knowing there's nothing you can do to help them except keep them comfortable. If anyone ever pranks me like this it's safe to say we won't be friends anymore.",

I'm glad she made it through, and you got more time with her.\n\n My Gram actually had an awful fall this last May, my 7 yo son was with my mom having lunch with her. She got up to get my son some ketchup and she went to sit down and missed her seat and in the fall hit her face on the edge of the table on the way down \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d. She broke her arm, fractured her hips so badly they were literally in like 20+ pieces. Knocked like 4 teeth out. \nMy son was basically traumatized by it.\n\nDrs said it was too much for her body to handle. She couldn't even sit up and she had really bad dementia on top of it. I went to see her a few times but she was going down hill fast on the 4th day and I went and begged the front desk staff to let me go up after hours to see her and explained everything. They let me go up 5 hours after visiting stopped and I thank God he let me see my Gram that night and she was having a good dementia night and she remembered me. I made sure I said everything I could possibly think of. She was so special to me and I made sure she knew just how much she meant to me. I'm a big guy, 6'5\" and 300 pounds and I was balling like a baby holding her. She didn't deserve to go out like that \ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e but she didn't deserve the suffering that she was going through, either. \n\nTo top it off, my mom's sisters all turned into blood sucking vultures all over her fucking possessions. It was REALLY PATHETIC \ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c \n\nSorry for writing so much, I just wanted to say I'm sorry about your sweet grandma. May she Rest in Paradise forever!",

She was having issues with my aunt she was living with and I told her that my place was her and she could do anything she wanted there. She got to live with me for a year and it was great!! She had so much freedom and made friends with the elderly neighbors I had. I would get to come home from work to home made meals \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70. I do miss her tons but I'm so happy that I got the opportunity to have her in my life as long as I did.\n\nI'm so very sorry about your grandma and your aunts acting like idiots. More so about you baby boy getting to witness the accident... It did a number on me and it's an image that never left my mind. But your boy is lucky to have spent time with his great grandma!! And as long as you keep reminding him of all the great experiences he spent with her, he will have that to remember rather than the tragic accident.\n\nMay your grandma also Rest In Paradise forever as well!!! Hopefully playing dominoes with my grandma... She was a BEAST at it!!! Never let me win LMAO",

It was especially good because I got to try so many dishes I never would have otherwise. She was born in Poland, and fled during the war when Germany started heading towards them. It was so amazing to me to hear her call her sisters and talk in polish. My mom had free long distance so my gram called her family every time she came over and I'd always sit and listen in awe. I appreciate the kind words too, she was the last grandparent I had \ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e. It was really awesome that my son spent a lot of time with her, she meant a lot to him as well",

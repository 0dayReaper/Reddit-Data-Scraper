Hydraulic oil can be quite hazardous to the environment and require a lot of cleanup when it is spilled. To save money when this happens it is not uncommon to use biodegradable non-toxic hydraulic liquids. This means you do not have to clean up the spilled oil.\n\nHowever getting sprayed with hot hydraulic oil is not a pleasant experience no matter how biodegradable or non-toxic it is.",

They are very visible and if you are strong enough you could in theory cut them with bolt cutters. The only reason this won't fall if a line burst is because of a safety check valve. It allows pressure to flow one way, but not the other unless instructed to do so. If a sudden drop in pressure happens the valve closes and the load will not drop.\n\nSource: I am a hydraulic repair specialist.",

Some ahole rich dude in the Facebook group once posted requesting \u201csome neighborhood activism\u201d. He wanted everyone to contact the city to complain about the terrible beeping noise because he works from home and it distracts his dear son Henry from zoom school.  This was spring 2020 during lockdown. He included that \u201cthey\u2019re just carrying some boards and hammers. Why don\u2019t they just use a ladder?\u201d I am 1000000% certain this dudes hands are softer than a newborn baby. \n\nNot only that, the work was done to a nearby house and would likely raise his property\u2019s value as well, which had already gone up $1,000,000 since she bought it in 2001. (I\u2019m nosy.)\n\nSome people responded favorably and made calls. I told him I use noise canceling headphones and white noise machines if I\u2019m distracted by an outside noise. Two neighbors who work in constructions essentially told him gfy because it\u2019s a safety feature and they don\u2019t have the luxury of working from home. I hate those people and I\u2019m so glad I moved.",

It has a bucket at the end of the arm, which I assume the man recording is standing in. \n\nIt's a mobile vehicle that is controlled from the bucket and is used in construction and maintenance of things that can't be reached easily in other ways. \n\nYou've probably seen a scissor lift at the mall or something similar, which just goes straight up. The boom, while it has the same purpose, is useful because it can lift you over things that you can't drive on, like landscaping, or rough terrain next to a driveway, sidewalk, or road.",

Even incidental contact with hydraulic fluid can cause some pretty nasty injuries, injecting it in to your skin, as I understand it, sort of starts to break you down like you've been bitten by a giant spider. In fact, hydraulic injection wounds look very similar to brown recluse bites only WAY bigger. This can happen with any system under high pressure and it can even happen with pressure washers but it's especially dangerous with hydraulic fluid because of how toxic it is.",

His father was also allegedly punched multiple times before club security \n\n\nKenzo had his shirt ripped off and the attackers set it on fire, according to Amandine, and then spat in the food that was served.\n\n\"My son was taken care of urgently, he was shocked,\" she said. \"He was struggling to get over it, his eyes were all red and his face was swollen, he was crying and he was shaking and he couldn't breathe.\"\n\nAjaccio have released a statement condemning the \"unspeakable\" acts of their supporters.\n\n\"[Kenzo] had expressed his dream of meeting the players of Olympique de Marseille, the club of his city and his heart,\" the statement read.\n\n\"Kenzo and his family were invited to the Fran\u00e7ois-Coty stadium on the initiative of the Rotary Club and the president of Air Corsica, so that the child realizes his dream during the [Ajaccio vs Marseille] meeting this evening.\n\n\"The dream quickly turned into a nightmare when Kenzo and his parents, who came in the colors of Olympique de Marseille, were shamefully abused by individuals who broke into their dressing room.\n\n\"Alerted, the security of the club intervened. Kenzo and his family were taken care of by the club's services and accompanied to the changing room area so that the child could fulfill his dream.These individuals in no way represent the values of our club and our island.\n\n\"Even the most extreme stupidity cannot excuse this behaviour! The club strongly condemns these unspeakable acts! AC Ajaccio will shed full light on these shameful actions. As soon as the individuals have been identified by our services, we will file a complaint against them. AC Ajaccio is in solidarity with little Kenzo and his parents.\"",

You have to be able to show clear evidence that you have the right person of course but that\u2019s where cameras come in. England does a lot wrong, but public surveillance more major crimes isn\u2019t one of them. Of course the root cause is probably to some extent poverty and education but increased security and punishments until then make sense.\n\nBut I don\u2019t know the real answer. This is just what I might do. I can however say that any low life willing to do this won\u2019t think twice if they here that someone else will be held accountable for their actions. Even their team or family. They are not the kind to care about others.",

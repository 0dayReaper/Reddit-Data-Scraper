Behind the railway, there is another small unpaved road.\n\nUntil few years ago, people would go onto the small unpaved road, drop the \"Christmas victims\", because are puppies or kittens bought during Christmas and then dumped like toys, and go.\n\nCars varied from the battered station wagon to the rich man with a high class mercedes and long coat just tossing away 8 weeks old cats. The animals would basically stroad along the railway till they found the houses. This way we had a dog that is now living with us, and a great deal of cats now in the care of my grandma.\n\nDuring a district wide search of some escaped convicts, they found someone dumping a dog and he received a hefty fine. Then the parcels on the other side of the railway were bought and now is just homes and gardens.",

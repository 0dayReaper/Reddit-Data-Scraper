She was the first girl I ever really tried dating too, and the first girl to say she liked me. It really hurt me and made me distrustful, and now I try not to get involved with anyone since none of it is worth the risk in my mind anymore. Now I just see dating as harmful and even predatory towards people like me. I still want that kind of connection with someone, but now I don't trust anyone and fear intimacy even more than before while simueltanously feeling extremely lonely and isolated from people because of that lack of connection.\n\nI am one example of what can happen to someone when you play with their emotions and mental.

Not me owing him, but free. Then when I wanted to get clean I told him my plan of weening off so I wasn't sick and he told me how it was a good idea and even gave me the last bag for free. Once I told him I was clean he wished me good luck and never text me again to try and get me back.",

And you're really fortunate that you got clean and he didn't try to get you back on it. \n\nAnd more importantly, it's really good for you on getting clean, I know that's a difficult road you took, and are taking. \n\nThat one is pretty rare, and knew his market. Regardless, even though he was fair to you, he was still dealing heroin. That's a dichotomy right there. \n\nI used to play with C, but one day came to the realization that all my friends only hung out with me because I was using with them. So I quit before I got addicted.  The next day, all them friends disappeared.  No love loss, no hate, no judgment.  Just gone.",

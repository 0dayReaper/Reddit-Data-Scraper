That even thinking about me sent her into such a panic. How she cried and cried about her fear but was helpless. \n\nThe church just told her she needed to pay more for God to deliver her from her pain.\n\nNow, many many many years later, she knows and calls it what it was, depression and severe post partum.\n\nI feel so badly for this little baby. I feel so badly for this woman, who was either living a life so horrid she has no human compassion left in her, or was potentially dealing with such difficult anguish.",

I suddenly realized this baby could die at anytime for any reason, I became obsessed with SIDS. I didn't sleep. I knew I'd made a horrible mistake, I was so afraid even if she weren't physically harmed, what if I said something or did something or didn't say or do something that would mentally or emotionally harm her. I was also told to pray. That didn't work lol.\n\nI ended up having a breakdown and subsequently dx with PPA, PPD, and OCD (the thinking kind, not the doing kind). Lots of counseling and medicine and lifestyle adjustments later, things are much better. But I'll never forget that time in my life. \n\nI'd never heard of post partum anxiety or ocd as anything other than washing your hands a thousand times a day. I hope things are good with your mom.",

After having my first child 7 years ago my personality changed but I didn't feel it. I felt like my normal self. I felt depressed but I've felt that way since childhood. After I had my second child 2 years ago it felt more intense. I thought it was because my daughter just cried louder than my son. I went through some really dark times. There were so many times I couldn't get my daughter to calm down and I wanted so bad to just throw her. I was sleep deprived, colicky baby, I got constant ringing in one ear from how loud she would cry, no help, in pain cause I had a c-section, breastfeeding, trying to spend time with my son, keep my home in order, etc. I always felt like i was in a fog. I never hurt her, thank goodness, but the urge would rise when I'd get overwhelmed. The only thing that helped me was repeating to myself that this won't last, time is going to fly by and before I know it she'll be walking and talking soon. I also told myself if I have unresolved feelings about the ringing in my left ear she and I can square up when she's 18 lol. \nWomen with ADHD may experience more severe postpartum symptoms and a worsening in ADHD symptoms after giving birth. Fluctuating hormones throughout a lifetime affect the severity of the symptoms, and pregnancy is no exception. \nFast forward to a couple of months ago and I've finally found an explanation to what I've been feeling my whole life (ADHD) and also found out I have PPD (post partum depression), PPR (post partum rage) and PPOCD (post partum obsessive compulsive disorder). Finding these things out has been a relief, honestly. I used to think I was just stupid or a bad person. Turns out it's my hormones messing with my brain. \nI'm not diagnosing this mother with ADHD but I personally think she could have an undiagnosed condition that could have brought on severe hormonal changes. It's definitely not an excuse but I can understand how one can get impulses they don't want or be so foggy in the brain they can't function rationally.",

Feeding an infant who is hungry but has trouble latching or taking a bottle can play really wierd head games with mothers who arent even experiencing severe post partum depression.  Our child was a near perfect breast feeder but the few times she had difficulty feeding, feelings of self doubt, failure, and self hatred almost immediately started going through my wifes head.  \n\nIts a shame the childs doctors and relatives werent able to intervene.\n\nIm also not saying in any way that this woman shouldnt face any consequence for her actions.",

It took a public episode of disassociation to actually get help. It never should've gotten that far.

A psychotic break is usually a lot more unpredictable and more difficult to pinpoint the root causes. The outcome is the same though, and there's a similar disconnect from reality that could result in them acting uncharacteristically. \n\nIt's very interesting. There are a lot less hate comments towards the mother than I expected and most comments are focussing on preventable measures, which is fair I suppose. But what is quite telling is almost every comment assumes this is as a result of PPD. As far as I'm aware there is no evidence that this is correct? And there is no backstory given on this post.",

You can become manic and have illogical thought patterns which you act on, the fact that she took care of her cats but neglected her child points more to the fact that this was caused by untreated mental illness. She's capable of being responsible, but in one specific aspect she was not.\n\nIt's a trap to think mental illness is totally binary black and white, \"how can you be to depressed to work, but you play video games 12 hours a day.\", \"How can you have social anxiety if you're going out every day\", \"How can you have post partum, if you're still caring for your pets\".\n\nIf someone with dementia did this you most likely wouldn't have the same kind of skepticism.",

I avoid it, all things surrounding it, all reminders of it.\n\nI'm fine otherwise. My life is not falling apart, I'm not unable to accomplish basic tasks, but every once in a while, something just gets blocked and it takes days and an enormous amount of effort to push myself through.\n\nIt doesn't feel normal. I would not have been able to understand it if someone had tried to describe it to me before I ever experienced it. That there would be a circumstance when I feel like I am not in control of myself, like there's a phantom operating me...it scares me. I'm not planning to have kids, but I can legitimately imagine something like this happening with me.

            "comment": "So the thing is when a company falls fort on goals &amp; objectives employees don't get a bonus. My current employer gives annual bonuses, but they are prorated based on performance goals. If we fall short on deliverables it is reduced, if we fall short on delivery dates it gets reduced. This seems fair to me but most of my coworkers do nothing but complain about it but they should just try harder.",

Are you that obtuse?   \n\n\nHow about the fact that this woman got a 6.5 million dollar bonus while giving the employees nothing? Ultimately, it's her responsibility to ensure the job is done. The direction of the org is on the CEO.",

If the CEO gets bonuses for performance of the business through dodging employee bonus payouts, then that\u2019s what she\u2019ll do. I would find most people would be VERY hard pressed not to do the same in the same scenario. Is this really condescending and gross? Of course it is. But the blame can\u2019t lie with her alone. She\u2019s shitty, for sure. But nothing different from 99% of CEOs on the planet thanks to their boards\u2019 desire and obligation to deliver short term, consistently profit yielding results to shareholders over ethical and long-term profitable operation of the business as it interacts with employees. \n\nI would like to see CEO and President, Vice President pay structures tied to long term success (5 years or more in consistent performance due to their direct input, held by the company until the goal is met whether they remain employed or not - their base remuneration should make the wait for incentive payout no hassle for these people) - only then will we see companies treating people, both employees, distributors, resellers, and end customers treated with dignity and rewarded for progressive thinking, with the best being promoted and financially rewarded as they deserve. In the current model, anyone and anything can and will be sacrificed for this years\u2019 success, no matter the long term consequences.",

The majority of those \"karen videos\" yupp Cali again. I swear California as a whole has become homeless tiktokers that make videos of break-ins while getting high and yelling racist slurs. The government is a joke not fixing it up. I know not all parts are bad, but man residents have their work cut out for them.",

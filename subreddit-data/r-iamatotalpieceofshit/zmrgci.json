That's a horrible thing to do.\nIgnore the rest of my post, but I'll leave it here if anyone wants the context for the rest of the thread.\n\nQueue the downvotes.\nWhat's the problem here? The dog is in the tray with the correct length leash.\nIs it on top of the tray cover or climbing around?\n\nIt's scared, yeah he should have pulled over and calmed it. If it's new to travelling like this it will take a few trips to get used to it and hopefully will enjoy it in future.\n\nPutting it in the cab unsecured is illegal where I'm from and way more dangerous. Voids your insurance too.\n\nLeaving it at home deprives the dog of exercise and stimulation.",

Like just picture yourself im sure you would have no problem going in the tray but being on top of the cover you will feel like you are practically riding on the roof.",

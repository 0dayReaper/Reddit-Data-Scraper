My wife and mother in law were considering buying guns. Fortunately I already own one so they didn't race out and buy them not knowing anything about them or safety but I am sure many people in the area ran right out and bought guns. This kind of tells both the good and the bad since anyone with no instruction or skill with safe handling can buy a gun but it also points to why many people will get them my mother in law thought it was the only thing that would protect her in that circumstance. Unfortunately I think it would have made things worse for her until she learned to handle and safely secure a gun but fear is a strong motivator.",

Even if your state gives you the right to carry, wht the F would you flash it to anyone let alone the cops..

    "postText": "A total of 5 staffers charged with crimes, including the 3 who did not report the abuse.  The child began to gag and they gave him a tray, which he puked on. Than they told him to clean it up, and gave him a spoon. He ate some of it and cleaned some with a paper towel, while the two pictures stood on each side of him.  3 other teachers/staffers witnessed this and did not report it; however, it was caught on video.  The two pictured are currently being terminated while the 3 are on administrative leave.",

My mother grabbed me out of the tub, threw me to the floor on my back, grabbed my hair and banged my head on the tile floor until I was unconscious. I remember my vision going dark as I lost consciousness. After I don't know how long I woke up with my mother crying in my chest. I suppose she thought she killed me, which she easily could have done. When she realized I wasn't dead, she pulled me up and hugged me. I remember feeling her wet face on my shoulder, and being very dizzy. But I remember every moment of that like it just happened. Over the next few years, I realized what happened was not right at all and I tried to ask her why she did it. The first time I asked, I was a teenager, and her response was, \"oh, you remember that?\" I remember being so angry that I couldn't talk about it anymore. The next time I brought it up was a decade later. I still wasn't able to talk about it because I yelled at her. her only response was that she was a young parent and didn't know how to handle a child splashing water. Now, some time later, she pretends that she does not remember this at all. And it's driven a wedge between me and the rest of my family. Her brothers and sisters don't want to believe she did this and so, what's easiest for them, is to not talk about it at all and ignore my need to hold her accountable, which is a bit devastating for me and my own family that I've built. I'm doing well, otherwise, but I do miss the rest of my family. I feel that my mother should own up to it and take whatever consequences come from her family.",

My youngest brother took the least amount of physical abuse but bore the brunt of their emotional abuse. He eventually passed away in a hospice center 5 years ago. My siblings and I had to find out via a Facebook post asking for prayers for my parents. \n\nI feel like my life is charmed. I made it a point to break the cycle with my kids, and I have a wife who holds me accountable for my learned shitty behavior whenever it rears its ugly head. Like my siblings, I swore never to hit my kids or scream at them. Maybe they were a little spoiled, but I\u2019m so proud of the young men they\u2019ve grown into and everything they\u2019re doing with their lives.",

My daughter is in 1st grade, and when her teacher went on maternity leave, she really struggled with the long-term substitute. It's still a bit dicey, but stories like this make me terrified of not drawing the correct line between disciplining her for being disruptive and believing her when she says the teacher is awful. She's on the spectrum so it's difficult to gauge sometimes when someone is *actually* being mean to her, or if she just took it that way because she really struggles with understanding other people's body language and tone and fills in what she thinks is happening based on her own feelings in the moment. Like, on one hand, it's absolutely not acceptable for her to throw things around the classroom when she's mad. On the other hand, I don't want her to think she can't talk to me about her bad days because she doesn't want to get punished. \n\nSorry. That was a ramble. I'm sorry your parents didn't believe you. I hope I can do better for my kid.",

Instead of just saying something she decided to violently shake my chair, getting the attention of everyone else and embarrassing me. \n\nLuckily it\u2019s been nearly two decades since I was in the fifth grade so I don\u2019t remember other specifics that she did (never anything close to as awful as the op though). I have a vague memory of her asking if I had a crush on one of my classmates in front of the entire class, but it\u2019s so foggy I\u2019m not sure how real it was.\n\nBut what does stand out is how my mom actually agreed with me that my teacher was being awful. My mom has always been the type to try and look for a reasonable explanation for someone else\u2019s behavior, which can be a good thing and definitely helped teach me empathy a lot of the time. Plus now that I\u2019m an adult whose had plenty of babysitting experience I\u2019m sure a lot of the times I thought adults were being mean or unfair when I was a kid they were actually being reasonable, and it\u2019s good she didn\u2019t just blindly take my side. \n\nBut when you\u2019re a kid that can feel invalidating. So the fact that my mom stopped even trying to find a reasonable explanation for my teacher\u2019s behavior always stands out in my memory and reaffirms that she was just awful.",

The crime may of caused irreparable damage, but punitive prisons are not effective at reducing crime rates or recidivism rates. I believe rehabilitation is the most humane way to run a prison as most prisoners are a product of poverty, poor mental health or prejudice. Emotionally, it is very understandable to want to throw them in a cell and throw away the key, but it's unfair for the redeemable population in prison who want to get better and be an asset to the community. Prison is not a torture chamber, it's a way to keep dangerous people away from the community. \n\nI only really wrote this because I think of all the people thrown in jail for 7+ years for minor offences like drug possession or are wrongly accused of a crime and end up getting horrifically abused in prisons, even killed.",

As we can see in some countries that are very punitive, not rehabilitating criminals leads to people returning to society with PTSD, rage issues and who haven't experienced anything else then violence and power struggles for many years. They are going to be unhingend.",

It's also possible that all of this was compounded by potential intoxication from other drugs that could heighten aggression. \n\nBasically I think someone could have asked them to do something as benign as moving 3 inches to the left to allow someone go through a door and the stupid prick still would've stabbed them if they decided that they'd been disrespected.",

We all just kind of turned and stared at her for almost a full minute without saying anything, and yeah, I thought \"...well I don't know what to do, I should wait for someone else who knows to do something\" before realising exactly nobody was doing anything. I started making a fuss in general because I still didn't know what to do, crouching down, asking her if she's okay, and that kind of jumpstarted everyone else's reactions. But it was just so odd, it felt so awkward.",

Of course it's terrible if someone is attacked or raped in front of me but honestly my first thought is that someone who attacks someone like this is probably willing to go even further (albeit many rapists are cowards in the first place) and you never know what could happen so you would just put yourself in danger instead of the victim. I mean If I was like 1,90m and jacked like a tank I'd might think differently but you're not obligated to put yourself in danger. \n\nAnd cases like this just prove it, people get stabbed for the most mundane stupid reasons. Last week a father got stabbed here in germany too because someone was cutting in line at a carnival ride and this caused an argument, the father just wanted to calm both guys down and the dude cutting in line just stabbed him out of nowhere.",

People just get paralyzed because they assume someone else who's more capable and attentive must already be calling 911 or getting a first aid kit, so they don't need to do anything.

She ran against him and won. He made a petition and had friends sign it to throw here out and reinstate him. \n\nWhen she brought this up to the mayor before a council meeting, he refused to provide the info to the other members of the council as he was supposed to. When the meeting started she was promptly kicked out, with the stated reason being that the sheriff who took her oath was not qualified to do so. The same sheriff who had sworn in other members of the council. When she got a lawyer involved for the obvious illegal dismissal, she was promptly charged with tampering with government records. The case was immediately dismissed, but being charged with a crime is enough legal reason to dismiss her and cover their ass for having illegally done so the first time.\n\nShe hired a lawyer to sue them for all this blatantly illegal bullshit they have pulled, but they claimed qualified immunity. A judge denied their claim, but they made an appeal and essentially dragged things out until she could no longer afford her lawyer and had to drop the case.",

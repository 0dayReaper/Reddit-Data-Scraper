In fact, they only make up about 15% or so of the Israeli population contrary to what the person said. The matter of these Zionists\u2019 ethnic backgrounds must be overlooked if we want to combat Israel and its atrocities by means of advocacy. Anti-Zionism must never recognise nor condone any form of racism under its name, doing so will only harm the struggle against the current apartheid.",

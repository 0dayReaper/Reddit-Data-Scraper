I'm just saying man, discipline your kids. I like to think I'm a pretty empathetic kid and that I didn't do horrible, terrible things up to this point, but I guarantee that it won't be the case with every kid. Especially if you start off refusing to discipline them or even acknowledge that their actions are wrong and tell them that.\n\nNow, I'm not saying hit your kid every time they make a mistake or every time they do something wrong, there's other ways, but please, for the love of God, do something to make this never happen again.",

Look for a smaller window company or a company that specifically replaces glass.  I replaced windows/doors for 5 1/2 years and just recently stopped after finishing college and for $1000 you could completely replace two windows including frames and recapping the openings in metal.  \n\nMy family has been in the window business for quite awhile and sadly it's also a business full of people ready to take advantage of customers",

Take that price and add tax. Add in a few random materials needed like caulking, sheet metal working for the trim and add in the \"material pickup fee\" almost every contractor applies to projects then add your contractors labor and youre up in the realm of 700-1000$ before tax is applied to the invoice. \n\nSorry but youre definitely not correct on this one.",

The glass with grids would cost about $130 and labour would be $120 for a total of $250.  The only materials you would need are a single tube of silicone caulk which you won't be charged for.  Got that pricing from my father who has run a window and door company for 25 years.  \n\nI have no doubt that op was quoted the $800-1000 price, but most window companies are run by crooks.",

Still a good chance it's a larger window to be priced at 800-1000 for replacement. \n\nHard to tell what the actual window looks like and we can't assume it's a 2x4 double hung. Could be a 2x4 crank, a 3x5 crank, 4x6 picture. Could even be a custom window. Maybe it's stained glass (unlikely, but still possible.) \n\nLots of possibilities that pump that price right up and the most likely in my opinion is its a picture window.",

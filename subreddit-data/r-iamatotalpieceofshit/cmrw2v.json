This can happen to anyone for any charge; whether it's Derik for embezzlement or some random dude that Reddit decided is the Boston Bomber. Even if cleared of wrongdoing, these people rarely (if ever?) receive a commensurate effort to repair their image. \n\n**I do not believe that our constitutional rights should be limited**, but I do believe that any news outlet bringing up someone's name in a negative light should make sincere amends to the accused. That doesn't have to mean a monetary payment, but the accused shouldn't come away from everything at a net negative. The fact of the matter is, the actions that a media outlet takes to profit from someone's notoriety simultaneously robs that person of assets - their social status, possibly their career - and they deserve to be made whole.\n\nYes, people that suffer damage can sue, but the press has more lawyers, more money, and a constitutional defense at their disposal. Additionally, not everyone that suffers this sort of public disgrace has the means available to them to sue in the first place. It's just another example of corporations being able to freely expend individual lives in the name of profit, and I believe that those who were used shouldn't need to sue to get their lives back.\n\nSomething needs to change, that's all I know.\n\n*Edit for clarity.",

I work as a reporter at an independent news outlet and this type of thing happens all the time, large media wiggling their way into tragedies. One of the first things we're taught at independent outlets is SSS: safety, surety, security. Is your interviewee safe? Are you absolutely *certain* they're safe, and, more importantly, do they *feel* safe with you? Is their identity, dignity, and the dialogue you share protected and unaltered?\n\nI don't think any of those boxes were checked here, and they rarely are in cases like these. It's one of the main reasons I've pursued a career in the far less financially-sustainable field of independent journalism. Large media is hardly ever ethical, whether it's a situation like this or misconstruing/rewording a clickbait headline that doesn't come close to matching the actual story/quotes included in the article.\n\n**Mandatory: READ NEWS FROM NONPROFIT OUTLETS, IT TENDS TO BE MORE MEANINGFUL WHILE CONCURRENTLY LESS BIAS/PARTISAN.**\n\n**Edit: I thought it'd be worth plugging, since I've seen some people asking for NP news sources, the INN (Institute for Nonprofit News). Go to** [**inn.org**](https://inn.org) **and find the \"our members\" tab about halfway down the front page and put in your state to find reliable, regionally (and nationally) pertinent nonprofit news.**",

I've heard 911 calls from people who were hiding in closets during a home invasion or hiding during an active shooter situation, and the dispatcher is just grilling the person while they need to be silent so they don't get spotted--their life literally depends on it. Only once have I heard a dispatcher pause when the caller says, \"I need to hide and be quiet now, the gunman is coming my way.\" In another one, the lady's hiding in a closet with an intruder in her house, the 911 dispatchers asking what the guy looks like, where he's at, what he's doing, if he's armed, etc., and she just keeps saying, \"I don't know, me and my son are hiding in the closet and I'm not going out to look, please just send help to 'address'!\" Dispatcher keeps asking questions and then you hear the intruder find her, drag her out of the closet, and her screaming bloody murder.  Idk if the guy would've found her anyways, but I'm sure talking in the closet didn't help the scenario! I get that they want and need to know as much info as possible for LE, but FFS, don't put people's lives at risk to get it.  \n\nEdit: I'm not talking about 911 dispatchers doing their jobs in any other situation. I am *only* referring to the cases when it's clear that the caller is in immediate, life threatening danger, where they need to stay silent, and their safety and survival depends on not being found by the perpetrator(-i.e., an active shooter whose mass murdering people, home invader, someone who only has a brief window to make a 911 call before the perp spots them, etc.)  \n\nI understand that dispatchers need as much info as possible, for good reason, and that they are trained in a special way to obtain crucial information for first responders. Yes, this information is **vital**, and it is their job to collect as much information as possible, even if it seems irrelevant. No arguments there. My point is that *sometimes*, there are situations where they are *actively endangering the callers lives* by continuing to speak and/or commanding them to speak. (Similar to the reporters in OPs post.) What's the point of getting a description of the guy or his gun, when doing so means the caller will be murdered by the time police arrive?? \nIn the home invasion call I mentioned above, the woman clearly stated her address many, many times, and that she needed police ASAP, that a man had broken in and was currently inside her home, she didn't know who it was, but that she was not willing to confront the intruder to give a description to the 911 dispatcher. Over and over she repeated this. She was struggling to open a lock box that contained her gun (didn't have the key on her), in case he found her, and said she needed a second to concentrate. The dispatcher kept asking her things she couldn't possibly know, and relentlessly questioned her for the duration of the call, even when she told her he was entering the room and she needed to be quiet. The intruder found her, dragged her out of the closet, and proceeded to violently assault her in front of her child, and all you hear is the man brutalizing her, and the woman and child screaming. If I remember correctly (it's been many years since I saw the reenactment), she somehow managed (during the assault) to hulk smash her lock box, get her gun free, and shot the guy before police ever arrived. In *that specific instance*, the dispatcher ignored the danger that the caller was in, and put her in grave danger, trying to obtain information that the caller *couldn't possibly know* without revealing herself to the  intruder.  Those are the instances that I take issue with. If I'm hiding behind a counter while a gunman is indiscriminately murdering every person he finds, I'm NOT going to give a 911 dispatcher a running narrative of the events, nor am I willing to pop my head up to give a detailed description of the shooter, and I'd appreciate if they kept the line quiet when I tell them he's approaching my hiding spot and I need silence.  \n\nFor these reasons, I'd be more likely to text 911 or Facebook live stream the events. Someone on my friends list can relay the info to law enforcement without me having to risk my life to provide details I don't know, or being found due to the voice from my phone being heard by the gunman nearby.",

Subsidized by ads; incentivizes sensationalism.\n2. Subsidized by crazy rich person; threatens the neutrality of the publication, tends to end up becoming a mouthpiece.\n3. Subsidized by reader contributors; wholly unsustainable. People just aren't willing to pay.\n\nCable news has problems with a twenty-four cycle that started with OJ Simpson and has gotten worse as people have cut the cord. Any \"handy\" tip like this absolutely misses the point. Trust an outlet by how well they correspond with reality. Some issues are going to be too complicated and you're going to have to go off of trust, but that trust should be built on articles where you have all of the facts and can gauge whether or not they're telling the truth, and what bits of truth they omit.\n\nCNN is bad because it leans way into sensationalism. They're more nonpartisan than you'd expect, they just lead with whatever gets viewers. They're not comparable to Fox, which transparently omits facts, lies, and misrepresents information to push a narrative that is totally at odds with reality.",

There's a good reason one of the first things every repressive dictatorship does is ban the free press. They're one of the most potent checks on power that exists. The problem right now isn't so much that media is universally bad, it's that Americans are really shitty at differentiating between good and bad because they lack critical thinking skills and seek out news coverage that confirms their preexisting beliefs.",

But there is extreme pressure from the top to engage. Typicallly, it goes like this:\n\n-Reporter is pressured by producers and/or assignment desk \n-Producers and/or assignment desk is pressured by News Director\n-News Director is pressured by General/Station Manager\n-General/Station Manager is pressured by Owner who is interested mainly in $$$$. \n\nEveryone wants high ratings, because that usually equals more monetary revenue. So greed takes a backseat to ethics.\n\nTo answer your original question, yes you can avoid this if you can find a way to not work general assignment. If your friend wants to be a reporter, they can try working in Special Projects or something else that doesn't require you to go out in the field on a daily basis, but that in itself can be difficult to achieve because of the scarcity of those type of positions. \n\nAnother alternative is to anchor the news. You'd stay in the studio, which is appealing for some, but I couldn't stay cooped up in a building all day. The fun of reporting was getting out int he community and doing something relatively different everyday. But like anything else, it can become a grind and one could get burned out quickly or tired of all the bureaucratic bullshit.\n\nMy suggestion for your friend would be to find any other reporting job that is not local news. Maybe something more long form like Vice or online platforms like Newsy, Cheddar, etc? Can't speak to the ethical standing of these organizations, but I'd have to imagine it's better than local affiliate news.",

Just be professional and let them go if they're uncomfortable talking.\n\nMost local news reporters hate this part of the job.  There's nothing worse than a producer telling you to go knock on the door of someone whose loved one just died.  Still, there's a way to do that that kinda dampens the sliminess of the whole thing.  I'd park my news car a house or two down from where we're going and let my reporter go up by themself to introduce themselves.  I'd take my time grabbing my camera and microphones and slowly make my way over to the house.  I don't want to look like I'm in a hurry to document someone's misery.\n\nAt the end of the day, if you don\u2019t want to hear what happened, then don\u2019t watch/read/listen to the news.  If you want to see someone who covered breaking news well, go watch how Adam Housley handled himself during the Vegas shootings.",

My best friend Michael was a TV reporter (local anchor, small market), and I was in college (working local papers) to hopefully join him. One night my senior year, Michael calls me crying, tells me he's hiding behind his Saturn...bc he'd just walked up on a decapitated head and gunshots from inside the house. He was in shock. 15 minutes prior, he'd heard the call on the scanner, and he'd beaten everyone \u2013 first responders, other reporters \u2013 to the house. It was a huge story for a small market. His report got picked up on national news, and the very next week, he had a similar exclusive. It was like he had super powers to find traumatic events before anyone else did. But he was messed up as a result. Over the course of a few days, I saw him go from superstar to traumatized mess. He eventually left the station for a job in military public affairs. And I completely changed my career path. We made the right choices for ourselves. And anytime I see an exclusive like that on TV, I empathize for the victims who become 15-minute celebrities and the reporters whose puny paychecks can't cover much needed therapy.\n\nEDIT: Just checked with him. The timeline's a little off, but the story still stands. And the head was thrown at him. He said he thought it was a bag of clothes.",

We went to a mid-size state school and were drastically underprepared for real reporting. He mostly takes pictures of cakes now, and sometimes, he has to write press releases about chem trails over the base. He\u2019s pretty happy.",

Not like he could get up to peak to see. People have used Twitter before in incidents to help give updates on where a shooter is or just passed through or other dangerous situations. It's not that crazy imo.",

He's broadcasting his situation and location to many people who can relay that information to law enforcement, without drawing attention to himself in the way placing a call would.  Someone might not answer the phone if he calls, or his voice could attract the gunman, etc. This way they know he's okay and where he is, and it doesn't compromise him. Pretty smart kid if you ask me.  Personally, I'd probably do something similar or Facebook live it. NOT for likes, but for documentation of where I am, what's happening, and evidence in case I get killed.",

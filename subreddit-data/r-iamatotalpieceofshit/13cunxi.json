These same news outlets do not offer any solutions but that's probably because the NRA or similar groups gives the network too much money for them to be suggesting the most obvious solution which is against their benefactor interests, and when you couple that with the increase in gun ownership during the pandemic (once again spurred by fear mongering, both in forms of pushing narratives of \"dangerous rioters\" to people living in urban communities who have likely never had to deal with a protest in their life, as well as fear built around the idea of strengthening gun control (which clearly never came) leading to more fema camp conspiracy bullshit and people with fomo simply wanting to buy a gun \"while they still can\") and this is the only natural conclusion to what has essentially been stochastic terrorism conducted by news outlets, with some particularly partisan outlets being far more guilty than others, though no hands are clean of blood here.",

Crime happens more often when the means of doing so are easier and more convenient.  A good guy with a gun can\u2019t unkill a child.",

Absolutely. But why do they have access to weapons with such murder potential? \n\nAs an example: a kid at my brother's school wanted to kill his bully. He stabbed the boy in the throat with a pen. The kid lived. He had researched how to get his hands on guns in Germany, made a plan of action, list of bullies to punish and tried to get into the local shooting club's security safe the day before according to CCTV footage. He could not gain access to a firearm so he decided to do it with a pen. That kid would have shot up the school, but because there is no access to guns he only stabbed one kid.\n\nSee the difference that guns make?",

These garbage bags who shoot children ringing their doorbell or playing in their lawn are cowards with an inflated sense of superiority (because of the guns). If he had to chase down his victims there wouldn\u2019t be any.\n\nYou\u2019re right that it\u2019s a disconnect from humanity, I would argue however that it\u2019s reinforced by the fact that he didn\u2019t have to get near anybody to take their life. If he had used a brick or a knife to kill someone we wouldn\u2019t ban bricks or knives, but the thing is\u2026bricks and (most) knives weren\u2019t invented as a way to kill something. Firearms were literally invented for the exact purpose he used it for. Why don\u2019t we start by limiting or taking away his access to that kind of power (like every other country on the planet)?",

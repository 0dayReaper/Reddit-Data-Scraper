There is so much strategy that goes into a single inning that if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking at it may come across as boring. But everything has a purpose, from the location and speed of the pitch to the position of the defense. And what the batters goal is and what he is thinking. I think soccer is boring, but I also never played it and don\u2019t really understand the game. Baseball is the same way.",

I used to think it was boring to watch but that changed once I started playing. Besides it a good way to meet with a bud and grab some beers hahaha I was in the second teir right above where where Aron Judge hit his 61st. Felt so bad for the guy that dropped the bag lool think someone offered 2million for it before the game even started",

We were debating about how messed up you'd get if you jumped over the railing from the first teir. Figured atleast a broken leg at minimum but totally worth the payout. I would have done it if I was the guy that fumbled it lol it was a buzz around the city. Everyone was talking about the 2million dollar ball before the game/ on the train / outside the stadium lol yeah definitely try that. My first time they needed a ringer, I couldn't hit forvshit but had wheels so I'd ground out and rip to first all the time. Made a sick catch my first game though and I started bugging the guys to put me in again !",

An older man rushed to grab it and got it before I could. The whole section I was in noticed what happened and booed him relentlessly until he gave it back, he was reluctant at first but after several minutes of boos and chants he finally did. You have to shame these people into doing the right thing.\n\nNow every July 1st when it\u2019s Bobby Bonilla day, I get a smile on my face and remember the small act he did for me. For him it was a small gesture that he obviously doesn\u2019t remember. For me, it was a fond memory that will be with me for the rest of my life. Will always be one of my favourite players because of it.",

My mother and I went to the book fair every year. It's was far from where we lived, almost three hours with subway. We spent over 8 hours in the book fair and we return at the evening, so we could arrive home at almost night. Well, as a 7 y/o, 8 hours of continuous walking made me tired as hell, and I couldn't stand up for 3 more hours after that, so I always found a place to sit in the subway. Once, a middle-aged woman pushed me down -I was already sitting- and I fell down on my chin -it hurts more than it seems like-. My mom started arguing with that woman but she didn't listen or feel regret at all. Without any other choices, I sat on the floor -and the subways here are really dirty-. By saying this, I'm just trying to show that kids are not always freaking stupid, but they deserve more attention, knowing they're in a more sensitive age -physical and mental- then most adults. I hope Karens understand it someday...",

Sapience clearly isn't a binary state, it seems to be a spectrum of self awareness. On that, many monkeys are closer to humans than to cows. \n\nWhat standards would you like to use to evaluate personhood or sapience? I guarantee there's a way to exclude some humans and/or include non-sapient things in that. It's a tough thing to define. But we know they're rather intelligent and capable of understanding concepts like fairness, justice, ownership, etc.",

Simple research will show you that more and more atheltes, as well as other young, otherwise healthy individuals, are experiencing cardiac episodes. When these spikes happen around the same time as this state mandated vaccine, we would be foolish not to see the pattern, or to even question whether or not this vaccine is the root cause.",

Are there pre existing conditions for these peple(that was the go to with Covid)\n\nMy understanding that everyone in the NFL was required to get vaccinated.   Why have not more died if the vaccine is the issue?  What about players in other sports who had mandated vax requirements.    \n\nThe first time I saw someone die in a sport was Hank Gathers while playing basketball.   That was in 90 0r 91.\n\nWhat I have learned is everyone wants to be a scientist or a doctor on the internet for political purposes without bothering to get the education.",

No vaccine yet. 2 months later I was still experiencing symptoms, especially cardiac things. I was 35. No previous illness. I had several exams done on me, which proved I had tachycardia and arritmia caused by COVID. I was vaccinated in August of 2021. Still having the episodes. Second time having COVID in January 2022. Still having the cardiac problem. Double boosted by now and pregnant because COVID also messed with my hormonal system and rendered my birth control almost useless (working at 15% according to my Dr). I'm being monitored all the time because of the cardiac things being overexerted by the effort of pregnancy. Long COVID was my diagnosis: smell and taste only came back a few months ago and not fully. Today I felt cinnamon flavour for the first time in two years.",

People get heart attacks. Healthy people get heart attacks. You seem genuinely stupid and incapable of processing logical thought if you think that links anything to the vaccines.\n\nIts amazing how the illogical, ignorant, uninformed, and always incorrect conspiracy theorist morons always claim to \"do their own research\" with a smug arrogance. All while completely oblivious to the fact that they're embarrassing themselves with each attempt to validate their nonsense. You intentionally turn a blind eye to reputable sources and instead follow the dumbest most unsubstantiated nonsense you can find that fits your narrative. Just another misinformation spreader.",

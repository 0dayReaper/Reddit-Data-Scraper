Cultural norms and news reporting might make it seem that way but it's more of a broad legal distinction. \n\nBefore 18 you're a minor - you can't vote, your parents are obligated to take care of you (at a bare minimum monetarily) etc. Essentially there are rights restricted from you and extra protections put in place for you since you are \"legally a child\" (of which I only listed one each but there's more)\n\nAfter 18 you're legally an adult with all that entails. This gets a little hazy though and part of that is the nature of the US government system and the difference between the powers set aside for states (and lower level governments like counties) and the federal government.  Some rights and responsibilities of an adult came before this point (age of consent as mentioned in the thread) some will come after (alcohol and potentially tobacco and Marijuana). But 18 is the generally agreed upon dividing line\n\nI assume, but could be wrong, that European countries have some equivalent legal distinction or cutoff between when you're legally a child and when you're legally an adult",

Kid was constantly having behavior issues and had been kicked off the bus after his third warning for punching another kids.\n\nOn the last day of school they showed up to contest their kid\u2019s report card because they scored just below grade level on state testing, so his parents couldn\u2019t understand how he could possibly have Fs. They pulled the \u201che should be getting better grades\u201d line on my principal. She said, \u201cI agree. It\u2019s a shame he didn\u2019t try to earn some.\u201d \n\nShe then pulled out all the office discipline referrals and said, \u201ctesting shows he\u2019s capable of below grade level work. All of this (motioning to the referrals) shows your child doesn\u2019t know how to behave. It\u2019s hard to earn good grades when you spend half your time in the office over acting a fool.\u201d \n\nShe then told the dad that his kid was going to end up in jail if he didn\u2019t stop making excuses for him and supporting bad behavior. When the kid went to middle school he beat up another kid. But this time the family of the victim reported it to the police and sued the POS parents.",

In the US, you can\u2019t legally record someone without their consent in 1) private property or 2) in a place where the person has a reasonable expectation of privacy such as doctors office, bathroom, or locker rooms. Everywhere else, free game. \n\nFederal law is a one-party consent, meaning only one person has to consent to the recording and the other doesn\u2019t have to know. This confused me because it seemed like it was always okay then. They\u2019re just saying it\u2019s illegal to eavesdrop. Like leaving a recording device in a room where no one that\u2019s being recorded has given consent. \n\nExcept if you\u2019re in a state that has a two-party consent law, where both people have to consent to the recording otherwise it\u2019s illegal.",

He is beloved for a reason - his work is truly profound and engaging. Once you learn to love his exploration-driven and dissertative theatre, you never go back. It is insightful, provoking, touching and downright funny a lot of the time.\n\nJust approach with an open mind, and don't shy away from intralingual translations, if necessary.\n\nAlso, watch the plays and movies!",

Getting ambushed like this in the morning was such a shitty way to start the day, and you\u2019ve somehow got to compose yourself and teach normally after a confrontation like this. My worst parent specialised in passive-aggressive emails sent late at night, which of course you\u2019d receive first thing in the morning and have a mentally gear yourself up for seeing her at drop off. I haven\u2019t taught her kid in 9 years and just seeing the mum\u2019s name is still enough to start the adrenaline and anxiety all over again. \n\nWhat so many of these parents fail to realise is that in 99% of cases the teacher and the parent are on the same team-they both want the child to succeed. Parents who act like this put people offside (and often spoil/ruin their child as well) and are just such a nightmare to deal with. When allocating classes at my previous school, the teachers would not only be grouping or separating certain students, but also allocating the pain-in-the-arse parents so that no one teacher had too many nutters.",

I almost wanna say she doesn't check that email but expects a personal 30+m call each day to report back on him which is unrealistic. Yes,  teachers are busy.  If you're mad about it talk to your local politician and get them to lower class size caps so teachers can give students more individual attention. \n\nOn the flip side I highly doubt he's a perfect angel at home and a terror in school.

Then outside waiting for the elevator at the same time I witnessed her mom try to put her winter jacket on her \"angel\" and the kid just punched mom in the face.

They profit from free labor and management by fear. Funny thing I make around 800 USD per month, and I earn more money than some doctors, lawyers, and accountants I know. This is barely supporting me and my daughter's expenses.",

That said, we started our outsourcers in the Philippines at $4/hr. My first hire still works for the agency (8 years) and now makes $20/hr USD living in Cebu. I got to watch them afford basic essentials and even buy cars as we raised their rates. This wasn't a multinational company, just a boutique research company. I'm still conflicted about it but I loved working with my team and still keep in touch with a couple of them, wishing them Happy Birthday and whatnot. I'd even ask in interviews why they wanted a remote job, and they would always mention the chaotic commutes in Jeepneys and lower paying jobs. I was in my early 20s and felt like I was actually helping. I hope they're all doing well.",

The last house my family rented is \u20b114k which at the time is about $300 which is a lot of money. That's more than my salary on my first job which at the time was around $250/month paid 15th/30th. I get about $50/month to spend on commute fare and food after taxes and my mother's cut lol no savings. And this is from a BPO that has microsoft as a client.",

They really aren't. \n\nIf the boss could hire no one and still make the same profits they probably would. They also aren't paying the workers the full value of their labor. Plus, if the boss ever chooses the move the business, the workers may get hung out to dry, if their current wages are truly so out of the normal market range that they're unable to find a similar paying role elsewhere.",

Ive accepted im being exploited because id rather that than the exploitative pay in my own country. $5 an hour(for sometimes too much work might i add) is okay in this economy as long as you don't have dependents. It isn't \"making bank\". It's just living the bare minimum of comfort, again, as long as you dont have dependents, cause that's a whole nother story.

The average salary of a new grad engineer is about $70k. Some companies pay less and others pay more. If I start at a company making $60k when other grads are making $90k, does that mean the lower paid new grad engineer is being exploited? \n\nCompanies that setup business in other countries typically don\u2019t fall under worker exploitation. Worker exploitation is when there is an asymmetry of power or unequal exchange of value between workers and their employers. If a company is paying above average for the locality, they are not giving an unequal exchange of value. They are placing workers above that. Now if the company paid workers less than market rate, then they would be exploiting them. Just because they pay workers less than what they would make in the US, does not mean exploitation.",

And with slave grown cotton from China?\n\nYou post this as if you've never heard of why there's no real manufacturing or factory jobs left anymore because it was all off-shored starting in the 80s/90s?

They\u2019re quite cheap for the work they are willing to do and mostly very kind, especially since she was like family to us. Definitely amazing people.\n\nThe cost of living in a third world country, such as the Philippines is significantly cheaper than Western countries, for example; Our nanny\u2019s earnings was all profit (before tax) because she did not need to pay for living expenses and food. I remember she would often send her pay checks back to the the Philippines to her family/for saving. The money she sent back was enough for her children to work average jobs but still live comfortably. \n\nSorry if this came of as bragging, but TL;DR is that  $10,000 in the Phillipines is basically earning 150+% cost of living.",

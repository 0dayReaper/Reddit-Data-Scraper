It\u2019s psychologically proven that people with a darker sense of humor tend to be more intelligent and utilize dark humor as a way of coping. My cousin had cancer 10 years ago for example, severely altering his life and still effecting him since remission today. We\u2019d go to Best Buy and when an employee came up to us he\u2019d say something like, \u201cyou\u2019d better not stand too close to me, my cancer is acting up\u201d. I\u2019ve attempted suicide twice and I\u2019m a recovering alcoholic. People tend to be shocked when I joke about it but those that have been through it typically laugh, because it\u2019s about levity and coping with pain.\n\nThis case is horrid and the victim and her family should be respected, but no one is obviously intending to specifically talk about the victim in these jokes. I\u2019ve seen far more tasteless joking about circumstances surrounding and including the victim, particularly Furuta Junko, one of the most horrible crimes committed. I had a FB friend post a pic of an actual deceased baby in a dumpster with the Family Guy lyric \ud83c\udfb5I\u2019m just a prom night dumpster baby\ud83c\udfb5 and it disgusted me along with several others, aside from being unclever .

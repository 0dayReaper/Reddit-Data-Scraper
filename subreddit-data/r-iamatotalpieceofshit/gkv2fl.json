In jail most of the time you don't have nearly as many luxuries like going outside or foods or tv, books just overall things to do. In jail you also have more fights because guys are coming in drunk or high or they are kicking whatever drugs they were on so they suck really bad. In prison guys tend to stick to themselves more than in jail and they just want to do their time. This obviously isn't true for all cases and maybe for a guy like this jail is better but all the people I know would much rather go to prison than sit in a country jail.",

I'm going to place Mr. Dirtbag on probation with Adult Probation &amp; Parole (AP&amp;P) for a period of 48 months. Consistent with the parties' stipulated agreement, Mr. Dirtbag will serve 210 days in jail. Credit for the time served up to this point is 148, that leaves an outstanding balance to be served. Upon completing the total of 210 days he may be released to Adult Probation &amp; Parole and Supervision. He's to check in immediately, which means within 48 hours. He'll be subject to group A sex offender conditions. He'll need to undergo and complete successfully sex offender treatment and therapy. He will also need to undergo a drug and alcohol evaluation and comply with any recommended treatment... Mr. Dirtbag it's going to be incumbent upon you when you meet with your probation officer, make sure you completely understand all of those conditions.\"&lt;\n\nAnd here is the disgusting pedophile's statement to the court:\n\n&gt;I just want to say that every day I wake up to shame, guilt, regret, and disgust. When I did the psychosexual evaluation all I could talk about was confusion and compulsive behaviors, talk about downloading, viewing, and masturbating to child pornography. I didn't understand why I would think these things. I started seeing a psychiatrist right after that. I was prescribed medication and I began therapy. That's when I started to understand some of the deeper mental issues. I learned that my self-destructive behavior matches my self-hatred. That's what I was trying to share with AP&amp;P. Mrs. Poulsen was right, I didn't see victims then, I saw it was only affecting myself. Now I see the victims. I just want to continue getting help. I want to repair the damage I have done, that I see that I have done. I want to be able to look at myself in the mirror. I'm sorry. I'll make sure this never happens again, you'll never see me&lt;",

It depends on the state, but in my state it's ultimately up to the discretion of the judge.  \n\nI was in court to support my friends last year (in an unrelated case) and saw this happen in a DUI case.  Prosecutor was offering some guy time served and probation for his 6th OWI in 5 years. He had already severely injured someone in a prior OWI wreck, and got this new charge while on probation for that. Judge was having none of it. He excoriated both the dedendent for his reckless indifference, and the prosecutor for the ridiculously lenient sentencing (far below state sentencing guidelines). After a thorough and severe verbal barrage on both parties, he went on to sentence the guy to 3 years in prison, no time served, and no chance of early release, and said he did it with the explicit intent to punish the defendent, and keep the lives of everyone in the general public safer--if only for a few years.  \n\nOn a side note: My friends attacker was in court waiting for his plea to be heard, and I still smile to this day when I think about the look of fear and doom on his face, lol.",

                                    "comment": "While that's definitely an interesting story there are two things that make this anecdote somewhat inaccurate for a lot of situations\n\n1. In most states the defendant has a right to withdraw their plea should the judge determine that he is not going to follow the agreement between the defense and prosecution. I am not sure if you live in a state where that is simply not the case or if the defendant and counsel in that case simply decided it was still a better deal than they would get going to trial but in most places, a defendant can just say \"eh no thanks\" if the judge tries to sentence differently.\n\n2. Judges will almost always abide by plea deals between parties. There are a number of reasons for this. One is the first point that a defendant can simply retract their plea. This means that the only real function of trying to sentence differently is rejecting the plea deal, not imposing your own. Chances are, defendant will just come back in front of another judge and get the deal through. Another reason is that, contrary to popular belief, until you have a trial judges ***do not*** have access to the factual basis for a case unless it is told to them. This makes them VERY jumpy to determine what sentence is appropriate because it can mean they are undersentencing or oversentencing given facts they cannot see. Finally, they generally don't do this because the system relies on parties doing their job and judges generally don't get in the arena of prosecuting because it isn't their job; they are there to mediate. If judges start to step into the world of prosecution that can lead to both prosecutors and defense attorneys resenting them. Eventually that judge will just get papered into the ground.\n\nI have seen a judge reject the sentencing recommendation from a plea deal. It does happen. But it is exceedingly rare and generally only exercised when their is a larger issue the judge is attempting to address (for example the times one time I have seen it, the judge is rejecting the mandatory minimum fee for the crime in the plea deal and making it a $0 fine because the judge felt it was unlawful to impose a fine for that crime for some reason. Another time a judge rejected the deal because it involved a prohibition on gun ownership for life and the judge felt that was unconstitutional). Basically it is only used when the prosecutor has made a mistake such as a plea below a mandatory minimum or where the judge wants to make some larger policy argument though its generally ultimately futile.",

You are offered a plea by the prosecutor, you can choose to accept it or go to trial. But if you accept it, it is made explicitly clear you sign it knowing that the terms of the plea deal are not binding, and ultimately upto the discretion of the sentencing judge. I don't believe it can be rescinded afterwards if the defendant decides they don't like the judges sentencing because they didn't honor the terms of the plea deal.  I suppose it could be appealed, but I don't think it could be withdrawn. In most cases, the judge does follow the plea deal.  \n\n&gt;until you have a trial judges do not have access to the factual basis for a case unless it is told to them  \n\nGenerally, the plea is made, and a sentencing date is set separately. The judge reviews each case prior to sentencing, including the criminal complaint, witness affidavits, photos, other evidence, victim impact statements, etc. The judge will read the criminal counts and the full criminal complaint in open court, and ask how the defendant pleas. If the defendant pleas guilty, they agree to the facts in the case as read. If not, they go to trial.  At sentencing, the prosecution and defense both make their arguments, and the judge hands down sentencing.  \n\nThis particular judge I mentioned is in a violent felony courtroom and he does not show mercy towards either side. I get the feeling he is trying to make a name for himself and rise to a higher position. He's been in the news many times for his harsh excoriations of defendents and imposing maximum sentences as warranted. He's been in the news for  blasting victim blaming relatives and admonishing them in court for making vile statements like, \"That little girl shares some of the blame for being raped.\"  He is particularly unmerciful in cases of child abuse, neglect, or abandonment, and routinely calls deadbeat parents \"a scourge on society\" (even when the charges are not relevant to their children).  \n\nHe's had defense attorneys and even *prosecutors* detained and held in contempt of court for comments and outbursts in his courtroom. He's also been controversial for his criticism of police and prosecutor incompetence/misconduct and mishandling of evidence. For example, \"All the officers body cameras malfunctioned at the same time\" or \"we accidentally lost the video footage\" does not sit well with him, and he will publicly call them out and blast the city/county from the bench. If you're interested, I can give you his name and you can read the pages and pages of articles about this judge. \n\n&gt;Basically it is only used when the prosecutor has made a mistake such as a plea below a mandatory minimum or where the judge wants to make some larger policy argument. \n\nThat was the case in my anecdote, which is why the judge reamed out the prosecutor as well as the defendant.  Apparently 2nd OWI and beyond in Wisconsin is supposed to have mandatory jail/prison time, and this deal gave the guy time served for probation violation on another case as credit towards this new case, which the judge rejected. He also admonished the leniency of the entire judicial system towards violent and repeat offenders--particularly the pattern he often sees of giving probation to defendants who habitually commit the same crime again and again with near impunity, and no sign of rehabilitation.  \n\nI mean if I were a defendant (or a prosecutor), I'd rather go against literally any other judge in the county. But I'm obviously biased in this case, as my friend and her little sister were violently assaulted, robbed, held captive, strangled, pistol whipped, raped, and beaten nearly to death by a violent felon with a long rap sheet. Cops caught him red handed with a cord around my friends neck, beating her to death, and the dude admitted on a jail recorded phone that he was intending to murder them both and dump their bodies in the river. The prosecutor's \"deal\" in this case, and with this particular judge, was to leave his sentencing up to the judge. They knew he would reject whatever plea deal was offered. The prosecutor told the victims she wasn't comfortable making a deal at all because this judge would overrule it and go for maximum sentencing. \n\nHe was there for plea and sentencing that day, but seemingly got cold feet and changed his mind after witnessing the DUI sentencing.  He plead not guilty and accused his privately retained defense attorney of \"coercing him\" to take the plea, lmao. \n\nI think he realized that, left to the judges discretion, he'd never see the light of day again.  So now they're going to trial.",

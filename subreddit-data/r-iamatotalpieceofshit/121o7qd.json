A neighbor pick them up, police officers came and were able to get into the house which is when they found a 6-year-old boy with intellectual disabilities in a locked dog crate. Apparently there has been previous DHS interactions with his family. There's a special place in hell for people like this.",

Some areas are whoa-bad, but most isn\u2019t. \n\nBecause the city is extremely extremely old and historic there wasn\u2019t a huge amount of \u201ccity planning\u201d done beyond the general center city area.  You\u2019ll notice that from Spring Garden to South Street is the original plan.  After that, it\u2019s kinda \u201cthe next guys problem\u201d.\n\nMayfair isn\u2019t the best of areas. I lived in Lawncrest area and that is somehow both better and worse than Mayfair.\n\nPhiladelphia is an absolute wonderful city with some incredible people.

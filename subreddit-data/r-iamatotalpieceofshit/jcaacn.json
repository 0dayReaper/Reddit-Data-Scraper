                    "comment": "It's why I don't buy any Apple products and support anything Steve Job's widow Laurene Powell Jobs does. \n\nYou probably heard the story that Steve Jobs abandoned his first daughter but then readopted her. What you didn't hear about is the extent they went through to make sure that she knew she wasn't a part of their real family. \n\nAnd on top of that, they both did a shit ton of emotional abuse and gaslighting. \n\nThis is from her autobiography itself, Small Fry by Lisa Brennan Jobs.\n\nHere are some highlights\n\n-They made Lisa sleep on the first floor next to the kitchen while the rest of the family slept on the top floor. The first floor had broken heating and she was constantly cold. Its California, but keep in mind that she's a petite girl who reached and adult height of 5'2\", and it is the Bay Area. She would constantly beg Steve to fix the heating, he refused.\n\n-Every time she would start excelling at extra-circular activities, her Dad would complain that she was not spending enough time with her family. He was say stuff like 'You know Lisa, I feel that you really don't want to be a part of this family'. When Lisa quit her activities to be with her family more, him and his wife Laurene would just give her Reed Jobs (their son, only a baby at the time) to babysit, and they would go out to some party or event.\n\n-They finally invite Lisa to come to a wedding. She was excited about it. She got a dress and everything. At the hotel room, after she's finished getting dressed and putting on her makeup, they hand her the baby and leave her behind to babysit while they enjoy the wedding.\n\n-She always wanted a NeXT computer like how Steve and Laurene each had one. Steve finally got her one, but when she tried it didn't work. Steve took it away, and never replaced it. This one may seem minor, but it's actually a part Steve's habit of dangling hope in front of her, and taking it away, like with the wedding (my interpretation, not hers).\n\n-When she was at her Mom's house (which was Steve's, he owned the house), Steve hired a child molester to be the gardener. I don't think he was ever convicted so her Mom couldn't remove him. But he was accused by his own children. Her Mom would constantly scream and cry for Steve to remove him. He refused.\n\n-Btw, if you are wondering where her Mom is in all this, and why Steve let Lisa live with her if he hated her so much: Lisa's mom was also emotionally unstable; Lisa was often the victim of her temper tantrums, because she felt that Lisa took away her life. Lisa confided this to her school counselor, who would tell Steve, who didn't care. Finally the school counselor threatened to call social services if Steve didn't do anything, which would be a PR nightware, so he begrudgingly took her in. From reading other books on Steve, if he's forced to do something, he does it very passive aggressively. From Lisa's book, it seems his abuse towards Lisa was like 'ok you forced me to take in Lisa, but you can't force me to give in to your ultimate demand of her being treated properly' (my interpretation, not hers).\n\n-Steve told Lisa he would take her in, but only if he had cut all contact with her Mom for 6 months, to prove to him that she really wants to be a part of his family (A line Steve repeatedly used on Lisa to manipulate her into doing things didn't want to do, and quitting things she did like doing, going cutting school for a family vacation 2 weeks before finals). Even though Lisa had a fucked up relationship with her Mom, she still loved her.\n\n-Cutting of contact with her Mom for 6 months fucked up the Mom emotionally even more, though she initially welcomed the change, saying that she needs a break from her (my interpretation was that she didn't want her to feel guilt for her decision). But the cutoff did have a effect on the Mom's already fragile psyche. When they met for dinner after the 6 months, her mom out of nowhere threw a tantrum about how Lisa abandoned her, that all she wants to do is hangout with rich people. I believe Lisa was only 9 years old when she had to endure this.\n\n-Lisa's chores included dishes, but they refused to fix the dishwasher for years. One day she had the initiative to fix it on her own. While her parents were away, she got a repairman to find the problem, turned out to be a 40$ fix. She was really proud of herself. She told Steve hoping to finally impress him. When she told him, he frowned. The next day he replaced the dishwasher with a new one. He wanted to remove all artifacts of Lisa's accomplishments (my interpretation, not hers).\n\n-Lisa got really into debate club. At her first big regional tournament, she got first place. Tied for first place actually. The first one to the podium would get the trophy. Lisa frantically rushed there because she wanted to show Steve the trophy to impress him (at the time, Lisa thought only if she impressed Steve enough, he would start to appreciate her). When she showed him the trophy, he made her quit. His excuse was that debate club is not useful in the real world , my interpretation is that he wanted to remove anything that would giver her a semblance of self-esteem (my interpretation, not hers).\n\n-Whenever Steve would see a homeless person, he joked that's who Lisa is going to marry. Whenever he saw a strip club, he joked that's where Lisa is going to work. The strip club joke started when she was very young, 9, or 10 years old I believe.\n\n-Lisa's therapist invited Steve and his 2nd wife Laurene Powel to a meeting with Lisa to get them to spend quality family time with Lisa. Lauren's response was 'sorry Lisa, but we're just cold people'. After they left, the therapist told Lisa something like 'that's pretty much what I expected'.\n\n-Lisa developed an eating disorder when Steve told her she was fat.\n\n-When Lisa was in college, Steve Jobs cut off Lisa's tuition. A family friend secretly played off the tuition.\n\n-Steve, when he only had a few weeks to live, did actually apologize to Lisa. She Lisa told Laurene, she downplayed this, telling Lisa \"I don\u2019t believe in deathbed revelations\".\n\nThat's not even a full list, but this writing this part put me in a really bad mood and I'm going to stop now.\n\nThe book probably doesn't even get to the worst of it. Her Mom said \"She didn't go into how bad it really was, if you can believe that.\"",

There's familiarity that just didn't exist for the older siblings. Curfews are later or non-existent when the first born had a strict curfew is a pretty common one. \n\nLife for your example your parents may have realized that you two were able to keep grades up despite the tv in your room or still spent time with the family or whatever their fear was didn't come true so they didn't hesitate for your younger step-sibling.\n\nYou obviously know your family better than I do but it might not be overt favoritism but rather normal complacency.",

He came home from school to find her dead in the hallway with his brother sick in bed upstairs. I think it was TB she died from (my grandpa passed away last year aged 98 so we are talking about many years ago). Back then men with kids got remarried so their was a wife to do housework and raise children. Great-grandpa married a widow with 2 children. She spoilt her daughters rotten. They enjoyed music so she turned a room in the house into a music room with a piano and many instruments (great-grandpa was wealthy from a successful business) but never hid her distaste for grandpa and my great uncle. She gave them no gifts, she bearly spoke to them, made sure they moved out and stayed out. She also hated strong women. \n\nGrandpa met grandma on leave during the war. They wrote to each other every day for 2 years. He proposed by letter (which we still have). The letter told her to go to his father's to get his mother's engagement ring (a beautiful diamond I now have and wore on my wedding day - it was my something old as well over 100, years old) and to meet his parents. She went. They had very cordial afternoon tea. Grandma was a strong independent woman. Evil stepmother didn't like this. I guess competition? She wanted a submissive woman she could boss around. She instructed grandpa to break off the engagement and if he didn't she would ensure great-grandpa cut him out of the family business and his will and would never see him again. Grandpa married grandma and they were together for 57 years, only separated by my grandmother's death. He never saw his father again. After grandpa and grandma had been married for 30 years the step mother did visit and apologise and say she was wrong when she said they'd only last 6 months. \n\nThe really sad bit is she did the exact same to my great uncle. He did as he was told. He broke the engagement with the love of his life. He married someone step mom approved of - a very timid twin. He was nowhere near as happy. Also his wife's dominant twin ended up living with them after her marriage broke down. It was supposed to be for a month or two but they were too shy to tell her she had to go. Twin even stayed after great-uncle's wife died!",

Thanks to all my pop's \"hard work\".\n\nThis woman never let's me forget it.\n\nThey dont even have photos of me in the house. None. Zero. It's like I never existed.\n\nReally fucks with me.\n\n(Edit: wow. Thanks for the kind words folks. I don't feel like I deserve them, but they are certainly appreciated. It is nice to know that I'm not alone in my experience and I know others have it far worse. You are also not alone. We can just strive to overcome and be better people for it. Thank you.)",

I'm invisible in my own home. Not even allowed to go into the kitchen if she's home. If im home, I keep to my small room in the basement. If there is anything that belongs to me outside of my room, she will throw it inside. She does petty stuff like wet my shoes with a hose and throwing clothes i'm cleaning onto the floor.

Even now with a child between him and my Mom, he doesn't play favourites. He spoils her, but we all do because she's essentially an only child with her older siblings moved out and living their lives.\n\nHe's fucking awesome, taught me all I know about cars, got me into mountain biking, we drink together, shoot the shit, hang out and have fun. I don't remember how young I was when he became part of my mom's life, but I remember the wedding - I was around 7 or 8 back then.\n\nAlways been there with advice if I asked for it or not and when I was a shit head teenager he still tried to connect with and reach out to me.\n\nNow that I'm replaying in my 30s I live a few hours away from my biological father who I've never met. My mom told me one day she wouldn't be mad or anything if I reached out and looked him up. I just looked at her and said \"what do you mean look him up, he's sitting right beside you!\"\n\nI have no desire to have my bio father in my life, my life's been damn good with the family I have and I wouldn't change it for anything in the world.",

But at this point my father and I haven't spoken in about a decade. I'd hear from him on birthdays/Christmas, and for a few years after the split he'd take me and my sister to dinner on alternate Fridays (we'd usually be back home within 2 hours), but not much more than that. I guess he just wasn't interested in having me around. Never bothered to learn much of my passions or interests. I've always been huge into movies, even as a child...he only ever took me to one movie. The current lack of contact stemmed from me deciding I didn't want to chase him anymore, and I guess he didn't think keeping up contact was his job. I don't think it was always bad growing up, but I guess he got to a point where he stopped caring. Wish he cared half as much as you, let alone a stepdad. Hopefully your boys learn from your example in how to do it right.",

He cut my sister out of the portrait and framed it with just his 3 kids in the portrait. \n\nI was a little upset when I first visited and saw it because that was my sister regardless of her father but when I brought it up he told me that he'd sent my mom a check to cover getting portraits done of his 3 kids(we lived 2000 miles away) and she did that instead. So he was a bit upset himself when he received it. \n\nThey had a tumultuous relationship to say the least.",

It taught me a valuable lesson about how titles can change your way on treating people and how they perceive you. Or rather how you see them. \n\nUnfortunately my stepsister never reciprocated this and became an utter disappointment. The same with my stepmom who like the women in this post, did all in her power to destroy me and my brothers lives. She is even trying actively to destroy my half-sisters life just to screw with my father. She is 10 and cries every time she has to go to her moms house\n\nEdit: i have two sisters, one is a stepsister that is 22 and one is my half sister who i love. She is 10.",

Don\u2019t get involved with someone who already has a child if you won\u2019t treat them like one of your own.\n\nI have 2 children by another man but am involved with a new partner and he is WONDERFUL to my children. His mother just recently passed in a tragic car accident and she had custody of my partners little cousin. Due to her passing he was just recently granted custody of his cousin, so now; together we have three children under 10 to care for, plus his 13 year old brother. He knew what getting involved with me meant and I know how important his cousin and little brother are to him and how much he needs to be there for them and now has the responsibility of raising them. It\u2019s something I am so proud of him for and love him even more for. He\u2019s a wonderful man and I just can not wrap my head around someone who gets involved with someone who already has children then proceeds to exclude them from the family. TREAT THEM LIKE ONE OF YOUR OWN THEY ARE YOUR FAMILY TOO NOW!!!!",

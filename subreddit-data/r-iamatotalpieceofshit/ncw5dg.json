Some states didn't open up vaccinations to all adults until about middle of April, which means those people are just starting to get their second dose. \n\nWaiting to change the guidance for another six weeks or so would allow all the people who want the vaccine to actually get it and for it to reach full efficacy.",

We all know our students in the middle school I work in aren't vaccinated (a few already got their first shots and a TON are getting first doses over the next two weekends) but there have already been a few eager to take their masks off. 4-6 weeks and most schools get a few month break, which would mean that schools can still demand masks without pushback.",

If they say people who are vaccinated don't have to wear a mask (which is what the data we have seems to support) then that same group of people is going to lie about being vaccinated in order to avoid wearing a mask like they've been lying about having medical exemptions to masks from the get-go. It's really hard to implement reasonable and effective public health measures when a solid chunk of the population thinks the entire global medical field has been lying about this virus all along for the sole purpose of influencing the American presidential election.",

If 90% of the population is immune, then that means that, in theory, 90% of the people you run into will be immune, so even if you aren't immune, everyone else being immune shields you. It's not 100%, but it makes the odds of an infected person coming in contact with a vulnerable person extremely low. \n\nThe thing is that most estimates for herd immunity from COVID-19 fall between 70% and 90%, some even higher. And recent polls show around 20-30% of the population will either not get the vaccine, or are hesitant. So, we will just have to hope those low-ball estimates around 70% are correct, otherwise it will take a much, much longer time to get herd immunity. \n\nThat's why it's critical that anyone you know who is hesitant to get the shot, needs too. There is a very, very small portion of the population who cannot get the vaccine for legitimate medical reasons, and they depend on herd immunity. The science is in, the vaccines are safe. You are more likely to die in an accident on the drive over to the vaccine than you are actually getting it. Please, please, please, get the vaccine. We are so close to this pandemic finally being over, but all of the \"no's\" and \"maybe's\" could add weeks or even months to it. \n\nThe no's are probably a lost cause, but if you know someone who is sitting on the fence, waiting, try to be that slight push in the right direction. it really does matter, all those \"maybe's\" really could add or remove weeks or months from the pandemic. Maybe this change in guidelines might also be that push some people need, although I'm sure \"I'm vaccinated!\" Will be the new \"I'm medically exempt\" for all the antimaskers.",

I am all for everyone calculating their own risk assessments and deciding for themselves how to best keep themselves and their family safe, so I would never judge you for your decision here.

At It's worst we had the police at our home and a child in the emergency psych unit at the hospital. Straight As to straight Fs for 2/3 of our kids. It was so hard to find therapy that we were wait listed everywhere we looked. Counselors are overwhelmed with the influx of kids.One of our girls cuts herself now. We are one family of many who experienced this downward spiral. This is a factor when case numbers are unchanged by kids in school. In fact, I would argue the school did not go back soon enough given the evidence we have.\n\nEdit: I'm getting a lot of negative and skeptical responses. Fucking shameful from the community that blasts the government for not providing mental health services to the public. Everyone talks about how serious mental health is but it constantly is the lowest health priority in our society.",

They took their time, analyzed the studies, and then deemed the vaccine to be safe for use.\n\nNow we're 5 months later, and there is still no good case against the use of Biontech / Moderna.

We weren't really all that careful about staying away from her, since at this point the damage was done. \n\nI showed no symptoms. My son showed no symptoms. I tested negative twice.\n\nThe jist of this story is my vaccinated wife didn't spread Covid to us, and if you have an inkling you may have been exposed, get a test before getting your dose.\n\nMy wife's doctor was livid they didn't test her prior to giving her a shot, as she was a nurse working with positive patients.",

I think its understandable that an expedited process would include protections. The only vaccine questionable in terms of known side effects is one the US doesn't even use. A known virus that Kills many shouldn't be more trustworthy than decades of science. \n\nIt's interesting that we marvel at some scientific advancements but avoid it when we need it most. As I said, I understand the doubt. I had it too, but so many have taken it at this point that it's nowhere near the dangers of leaving covid un-checked.\n\nmRNA vaccine research has been around for a very long time and the pfizer covid vaccine is built on top of lots of existing research. Hell, it started as a method for a cancer vaccine which I doubt people would turn down if/when that happens now that they've received a lot more funding due to covid.\n\nNot all science and advancements are driven by greed and evil. I'm not saying you are saying that at all. You are questioning of it which is healthy in any scientific process, personal or otherwise. I just hope you see the good and amazing achievement this really is for medical science to pump out a new vaccine so quickly in reaction to a pandemic that we are in enough luxury to question it. If we want to keep ahead of the onslaught of diseases trying to kill the human body, embracing advancement is an important part.\n\nWe'd all love to wait for perfect results and information, but sometimes waiting is what can kill the worst.

THIS TWEET sent her off the edge after practically worshipping the ground the last president walked on. Some people will just never make any sense to me.\n\nEdit: fucking Christ the amount of people who somehow have taken away from this comment that political differences is the only reason I\u2019m not friends with this person anymore. At least the sub seems to be deleting those comments. \u201cThey don\u2019t agree politically? That\u2019s the only reason this person broke it off!\u201d My god I love it when people on the internet think they know everything about situations they have no way of knowing anything about.",

It\u2019s just become a bunch of complaining children who cant get their facts straight. The only outliers here are those who haven\u2019t yet gotten the vaccination and have health issues wearing masks. But vaccines should be more than accessible by now.\n\nCome on, people, please...",

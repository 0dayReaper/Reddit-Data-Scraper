We know this, we have evidence that shows this. Why would you retest a driver when they are statistically likely to be BETTER at driving than the last time they were tested?",

And they'll never gain experience if you take their licenses away. Literally everyone starts out as a brand new driver. Also teens tend to crash because they do stupid young people reckless driving stuff. That won't show up on a driving test because they'll be on their best behavior.\n\nThe elderly on the other hand usually become bad drivers because they start to decline physically. They become weaker and frail, their reaction time increases dramatically, their visual acuity declines, and their mental sharpness might dull as well. It's a natural thing that happens to everyone eventually as they age.",

In the parts that have it it's largely barely useable.  if someone suddenly can no longer drive who is not retired then what happens?  They may well lose their job or livelihood.  That's a consequence that goes far and beyond the intent behind retesting, especially if their driving record doesn't show a history of dangerous driving.\n\nI also do agree with the flip side that if you're a hazard to others you shouldn't be on the road...but I just see the problem with trying to institute such a rule.\n\nTo me, this is more of an argument for guaranteed income.  That way at least if they lose their job they have a livable income guarantee.",

Between 65-74, they're less likely than young drivers (16-19yrs) to cause an accident. \n\nPeople over 70 have more crash fatalities than teens, but the difference there is that the fatalities are usually themselves, because elderly people are more vulnerable to injury than the young.",

I talked with a guy who is the head of the local VA chapter And he suggested taking my dad for a drivers test which he will obviously fail. Then they would pull his license.\nI promise you, however, that wouldn\u2019t slow him down one second. He would continue to drive without a license. If you try to take his car, he will just go out and buy another one the next day, seriously! This is a maddening situation!!!",

I am a \"car enthusiast\" and take extra care of my cars when it comes to detailing, mods, etc. I had an older woman (looked to be in her later 60s) slam into the back of WRX at a right turn, a merged intersection (they have since removed the lane because it was a dangerous spot). I guess she didn't bother to look up to see if I pulled out yet and just gunned it, slamming into the back of me. She was in a Mini Cooper. I pulled up some to get on the side of the road and she pulled over behind me. I got out to check out the damage. Her license plate bracket bolts pressed into my bumper (4 spots), making indentions and spider cracking the paint. It was a metallic white (crystal metallic) so it was noticeable. You could see the black ABS plastic under the paint from the indentions.\n\nI didn't yell at her but of course I told her that I was not happy and that this needs to be taken care of. She first tried to talk it off as if it wasn't even a problem and just a few scratches. I told her that it was not just a scratch to me and it was an issue. I asked for her insurance and then she insisted on paying me to fix it and offered me $200. I declined and told her that there is no way that was a $200 job. She started to get irritated by then and gave me an attitude about her insurance. I eventually got the information from her and filed the claim. It ended up costing over $2k because they had to replace the bumper and had to have it professionally painted since it was a metallic paint and also had to make sure it blended with the other body panels.",

I had just used my kid's college fund to get the car after my Mazda drowned in a hurricane. Hit me so hard my seat twisted, my stereo face ended up in the back seat and it resulted in a 5 car accident. The dude driving was some young kid who jumped out and started WHISTLING. The owner of the plumbing company, who my dad knew, offered to pay for rental car, damages ect. I ended up paying almost $800 for the rental, there was over 4K in damage to my car (should've been totalled out) and the dude went AWOL. Fucked up my back.\n\nTo this day, though, I just thank my lucky stars I'd dropped off that thinner already. We weren't even supposed to make deliveries in personal vehicles. \ud83d\ude11",

Unfortunately, there's a good chance it'll be reduced due to his age but I personally think he deserves to be locked away for good. What's to stop him from killing a woman who denies him as he gets older? I also believe the parents should be charged as accessories as well as charged with child endangerment.\n\nEdit: typo",

Sure the kid should be charged for everything. But to charge parents for his actions. You sound ignorant. That's like charging your parents for you being a pos person. Makes no sense. Maybe neglect or something for not knowing where the child was or what your child was doing. But charging the whole family is absurd. That's like saying if your German you should be charged with hitlers crimes. Wtf. Crimes you yourself did not commit.",

An eighth grader should in no way, shape, or form have such unsupervised access to a firearm that he could get it in his possession, load it, take it to the neighbors, shoot 8 horses with it, bring it back home, and put it away without either of his parents knowing any of that occurred. They are accomplices to the murder of those horses and should be held responsible just the same as if they shot them.\n\nYeah, we have the right to own firearms in this country, but that right doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re free from responsibility or accountability. If you have kids and you choose to have firearms in your home, you have a responsibility to keep them locked up so that the kids can\u2019t get to them. If you don\u2019t, and they do something stupid - because, you know, kids are fucking stupid - you should be held liable.\n\nOr, you know, don\u2019t have guns around when you have kids.",

They literally do this so they don't have to go with them or supervise when the kids go hunting on the weekends. \n\nMany of them have large properties and its completely legal for their kids to have those guns on the property for hunting. \n\nI would not be surprised if that were the case here. Especially in a place where a neighbor has horses. Just screams rural large property. Hopefully this starts a national conversation about these loopholes. Hunting is used as an excuse for so much and is used to mask the behavior of these kids. \n\n\"He just loves to hunt\" \n\nMeanwhile kid is out there shooting animals and torturing them with no one around. Then they throw their hands up and say there was no way to predict this tragedy!",

The only gun that\u2019s ever been available to me during my childhood was a pistol on the very top of my dads bigass bed frame. I was never home with the gun by myself, as I always had my older brother watching me. That being said, the gun was only left there in the event someone tried to hurt me and my brother while we were the only ones at home. We both understood how the gun worked and that it was dangerous, and only meant to even be looked at in emergencies. Allowing your kids to just run loose with hunting rifles, is the epitome of redneck.",

There\u2019s a possibility the weight is resting on the upper part of the carrier. She looks older than child rearing age, but people in their menopause who take baby dolls to the grocery store with them are pretty damn weird and there looks to be a sippy/young child cup visible in the seat of the cart, so maybe it is a real baby and this is crazy grandma. I feel like whoever took this picture should be able to confirm if the child is real or not\u2026.\n\nEdit: that is not the purchase of a new toy\u2026 look like surrounding car seat/carrier is visible in the picture. Either she is lugging a baby doll like it\u2019s real or she resting food on top of a child carrier and isn\u2019t afraid of a toaster smothering the child with one wrong move.",

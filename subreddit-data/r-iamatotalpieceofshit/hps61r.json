They desperately wanted to put trainers back into the water, and would absolutely do so in a heartbeat if the law would let them.\n\nBut even if they aren't in the water with the whales, the animals are still being abused. They are stuck in tiny pools. Sea World dedicates more space to parking than they do to the whales.\n\n(Edited due to my error. I was counting Alexis Martinez in Tilikum's kill total, but he was not killed by Tilikum. His death did come just 2 months before Dawn's, but it was another whale at a park connected to SeaWorld.)",

I have had the privilege in my line of work of getting to experience the behind the scenes of a live animal circus. Not every animal circus is beating their animals and treating them like garbage. One I got to work with a guy who owned the whole thing and also owned hundreds of acres of land for all the animals. He raised his elephant from birth (rescued) and cared for it. This elephant was like a child to him. He had room to roam when not on the road, he wasn\u2019t kept in a small cage backstage at the show. (There\u2019s still stains on our arena floor from the elephant going potty) He was well fed and was given plenty of love just like the rest of the animals he had with him. \n\nI don\u2019t have much detail about the rest of his animals because it was the first time I had seen an elephant in person so I was mesmerized. They are beautiful animals. But they all were being cared for and handled with care. Their \u201cacts\u201d were more just showing the animals in a dramatic way. There weren\u2019t many actual tricks. More of an educational circus. \n\nSo while yes, there are some shitty people doing shitty things to animals in circuses, there are a few people who really do love and care for their animals in the show.",

If you pet a puppy in unusual spots like his legs, his neck, around his mouth he might get uncomfortable and start nipping you just because you're at his mouth even though he may in the end still appreciate the petting. In his puppy years he won't be big enough to hurt you and by his adult years he won't be uncomfortable anymore and will just like the attention. This philosophy differs from learned helplessness in that you're not teaching the puppy to suffer through pain, you're just expanding his comfort zone shall we say.",

I worked at Odysea Aquarium in Scottsdale, AZ and I can promise you the people that actually interact with the animals do truly love them and want the best for them. They're just unfortunately incredibly fucking naive.",

Of course Seaworld isn't perfect but they do their best to take care of their animals and they certainly aren't kept in tiny pools in all the backstage areas I've seen. Their shows used to bother me some but over the last decade or two they've made efforts to make their shows less about cool tricks and more about educating people on conservation and what their rescue teams do in the field. They not only ban trainers from swimming with orcas, they're also no longer breeding orcas either, so the ones in captivity now are the last. They've done an amazing job listening to valid criticisms and tackling propaganda against their rescue efforts, unlike PETA and Blackfish.",

They are shady behind the scenes. You are relying on them to be telling the truth, but instead they are only presenting what they need people to see to reconsider taking their kids and spending money. \n\nhttps://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-seaworld-lobbying-20150822-story.html\n\n&gt; SeaWorld has opposed recent federal changes that now list captive chimpanzees as endangered, increasing protections available to them. The company has chimps at its Tampa Busch Gardens park.\u00a0\n\n&gt; In California, SeaWorld last year authorized a firm to begin lobbying the same day legislation banning orca shows and breeding was filed.\n\n&gt; So far this year in California, SeaWorld has spent an additional $140,000, although the bills lobbied have nothing to do with marine mammals.\n\nhttps://qz.com/1725020/why-hasnt-the-us-banned-dolphin-and-whale-shows/\n\n&gt; After a huge backlash sparked by the 2013 documentary\u00a0Blackfish,\u00a0SeaWorld promised\u00a0in 2016 that it would phase out using killer whales for entertainment by the end of 2019. The company seems to have forgotten this pledge, however: it is currently promoting a 2020 killer whale show.\n\n&gt; In the past five years, SeaWorld has\u00a0spent around $3 million\u00a0on federal lobbying. In the years immediately following\u00a0Blackfish\u2019s release, it was one of the largest donors from the recreational sector, with annual expenditure exceeded only by the National Football League.",

SeaWorld is roughly $73/day, disney is rougjlt $109/day a day on their site with no package and universal can be up to $119 for a 1 day 1 park pass. It's crazy how much their prices have risen.",

Some of the species you see in zoos at the moment would not have survived without breeding programs being implemented by them, often in cooperation with other zoos and by visiting these zoos you are funding their conservation projects. Furthermore, many zoos help rehab and release injured wild animals. \n\nEven doing shows with the animals aren\u2019t so bad, like the wild bird shows which at their core are learning about these species while getting to see them up close (as close as a flying bird can get without it being springtime in Australia) doing what they do best. The problems are the zoos like this that are just animals in pitiful little enclosures or being forced to do tricks purely for profit.",

The bully only got 1 day suspension. And that was only because my dad was a teacher at the school and raised hell. The school then also tried to suspend me, but I did nothing wrong. Only reason I didn't get suspended is because my dad threatened them with quitting and some other stuff (he had 20 years in that district and was one of the best teachers there).Plus my dad knew how the school worked and just how many adults had failed at their jobs to allow this to happen. Him knowing how to manage the bureaucracy saved my ass. The school tried to sweep everything under the rug and blame me for getting choked unconscious and making a scene. Shitty fucking school there.",

I didn't know jack about fighting then but I sure was gonna do my best. Guy hit me once between the eyes, I shook it off and kicked him in the crotch so hard he dropped like a rock, and made no effort to get up. He never spoke one word to me after that. Never got in trouble either. \n\nSometimes you gotta defend yourself, always make sure the other guy makes the first move...then you're in the clear to use necessary force...but not more than that, then you become the aggressor. \n\nThat's what people forget...dont cross that line from defense to offense, then you stay on the right side of the crucial rule...\"I was just defending myself\"",

My high school was a specialty school that was always under fire for lower test scores than the average (duh, the majority of the student population didn't even speak English to take the damn tests) and in my sophomore year we got a special needs kid who would corner girls and make them uncomfortable as all hell. Teachers wouldn't/couldn't deal with it since there was an order to keep him in normal classes so he could \"learn important social skills\" and thusly they couldn't even give him like full day supervision or anything to keep him under control.\n\nHe didn't get in any trouble until he came after me because someone else said they wouldn't have his kid and he thought I said it. He instantly tried to claim racism (I'm white as a cloud, he was black) and started a major shit storm where he threatened to beat me up. So they tried to cover the whole situation up even though I had a literal classroom of witnesses by switching my classes. They only dealt with him because my mom stormed up with threats of a lawyer since they were obviously catering to him and being biased rather than punishing the real problem maker. All of a sudden it was ok by central offices to put him in special needs classes that had a dedicated teacher for the students and kept him monitored during the day. Guess a lawyer was even scarier when there was a legit cause to bring one.",

One day his target was me, and like most of the other people he beat up all the other kids would gather around and egg him on, in hopes to see a fight. Seemingly I was the first person who didn't mind said fight and when he went to grab me and got me in a head lock, I wiggled my way out and I threw my tiny little fist at his stomach. He cried, a lot. I felt awful at first but remebered all the other people this kid had hit and slammed into the floor, so I just walked away. Needless to say the on duty lunch lady scolded me about it and another teacher told me i had detention for the next 3 days.",

The administration did nothing about it, we found out later they didn't even tell the kids parents their kids had been hit claiming the kids wouldn't remember it. The kid and his parents started claiming my wife was racist because he was a black kid, when her class is 2/3 black and she had no problems with any of the other kids. That same administration got rid of a lot of good teachers after last year and hired a bunch of his friends and people he knew. We've gone all the way through the superintendent trying to get anything done about it. It's  crazy how lazy and corrupt school systems can be.",

They held him down and then bashed his head in with these huge ass rocks.  I was hiding in the bushes with one of my friends, crying as it was happening.  It was at our bus stop, which was a street corner.   Believe it or not, about 10 cars drove past what was happening and did nothing.  Maybe one of them called the police but in 2003 cellphones weren't super common for people from our part of town.    \n\n\nAnyway, finally an adult pulled over and started screaming at the older kids to stop.  This woman was a short blonde with platform sandals and a white buggy with flowers printed on the side.  To this day I still think she's one of the most badass people I've ever come across.  She told the kids (some of them actually bigger than her) that she'd called the police so they better haul ass back home before they got arrested.    \n\n\nThe police did show up shortly after along with an ambulance.  I can't believe that the kid who was my age didn't die.  I couldn't even recognize his face because it was so bloody, even though I'd known him for years.  My family moved across the country shortly after and since this was way before Facebook, I lost touch with a lot of my childhood classmates.  The last I saw of the boy who was attacked, he was a lot like Jimmy Valmer from South Park.  He had his intellectual wherewithal but he was also physically disabled and needed braces to get around.",

He was invited to a sleep over and the other boys ended up jumping him and taking his phone away. The next morning she found bruises on his neck as well. \n\nIt was a real surprise to hear and just made me mad for them. I cant believe this is the world we live in right now. Kids today should not have to live in fear. I'm very glad to hear charges are being pressed and those boys will have consequences. \n\nIm so sorry he had to go through such a thing. I hope your son is alright and I hope this does not make him scared to ride the bus again and go to school. He really should be enjoying his childhood right now.",

In fact, I'd say we're making progress in that we all know that is wrong and we can collectively speak out against it and change social mores. A lot of millennials actually seem pretty \"woke\" to me compared to previous generations.\n\nSort of like how not too long ago the concept of sexual harassment was a novel idea and people argued that it was just \"boys being boys\" or whatever. #MeToo has brought a lot of that shit to the forefront and has made the message clear that our societal norm excludes that kind of behavior. It's not that men suddenly became creeps, but that our culture is finally getting to a place where victims feel comfortable coming forward and being heard.",

Mental illness has become so diluted that it could literally mean, \"this person does something I don't understand,\" or \"this kid wasn't raised to behave,\" or \"wow, violence!\" or whatever. \n\nKids are dumb. They like to find and push their boundaries. Kids make bad choices. That doesn't make them mentally ill--unless you count underdeveloped brains (something we all suffer from until the age of 25) as a mental illness. \n\nThose bullies could have killed that kid. But I would wager that it never crossed their mind that what they were doing was potentially lethal. My guess is they were being mean, and reveling in the power it gave them to be mean.

My parents didnt press charges but a few weeks later found out my dad paid some high schoolers from my neighborhood to beat the snot out of the kids that did it to me.",

Parents need to teach their kids to respect other people and the boundaries of people as well as how to defend and stand up for themselves. Kids have no respect for anything they are ungrateful spoiled ass little shits that need discipline and structure. The world has gone to shit because everyone has to put their nose in everyone elses business. I'm sorry this has happend to your son.",

So let\u2019s say she lost her virginity to her dead husband, that doesn\u2019t make her low value but better than sleeping around everyday.

You are still very much the same person after consensual, happy sex. And now you know more about your body. Men\u2019s pleasure is A okay but a women having autonomous sex, rights &amp; being independent to do legally what she wants is horrible. \n\nIt seems like to men, many just want to be the first to use her body &amp; \u201ctake her purity\u201d. Like a dog marking his territory to show off to other dogs. You don\u2019t care about women. You care about having an object to fixate on and claim. And then use the idea of God to shame women for life. Virginity, purity and religion seems like a quiet tyranny over a woman life.",

It\u2019s just that for *me* I admire virgin women for religious reasons and because they don\u2019t sleep too much which makes them more valuable. (not everyone can have her, get it?) Other women are still the best and I didn\u2019t even try to judge them\u2026 it\u2019s just me personally.\n\nSo you know it\u2019s never too late to change your mindset and become valuable no matter how many men touched you. It\u2019s more about the mindset than the \u201cpurity\u201d. In other words this goes both ways for both genders since it\u2019s all about the mindset that not anyone can have me.",

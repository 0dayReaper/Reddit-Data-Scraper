They opened the door and it was a delivery person with a pizza. They hadn't ordered anything, but they took the pizza anyway. Most of them wanted to eat it, but one of them got concerned, so they called the pizza place about it. They were told that there had been no deliveries to that area at all. When they went back to decide what to do with the pizza, they found that the dog had gotten into it while they were calling. They found the dog getting very ill, and called the police. An abandoned uniform for the pizza place was later found nearby, and I believe the dog didn't make it.\n\nProbably just a scary story, but still.",

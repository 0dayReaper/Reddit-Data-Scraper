My friend was ask to testify for the FBI after all this.\n\nIn one case a worker sexually blackmailed women, saying they couldn\u2019t get their property back unless they did sexual favors for him.

He had scratches on his neck and so they arrested me. They were defense scratches while I'm watching him over me choking me until my eyesight was fading. On the way to the police station the officer noticed bruising on my neck so he called in and said he is taking me to the hospital. I was in a room with 2 officers watching. Bruising started showing up even more. They still blamed it on me. I saw my exes statement and he didn't say anything about me starting it or anything about the few scratches but they said they were going to press charged against me as the state. I ended up going to court and on probation for a year. Even in court my ex showed up to tell the prosecutor this was bullshit and they wanted nothing to do about it. I will never call the cops again and this is how people get killed in DV situations. I was and still am shocked.",

But when you support the institution that not only continues to permit these attacks to happen, but closes rank to support the perpetrators and ensures they can keep their pension, never see charges or jail time, you're condoning the unacceptable behaviour, which is shitty.\n\nIf not all cops are shitty, why are all the rest of the nonshitty cops not standing up to condemn the shitty officers at every opportunity? It's because the vast majority and decision makers are shitty, and drive out the good ones before change can gain a foothold, leaving us with shitty cops.",

Instead you chose to close ranks and defend completely indefensible actions. Nobody being assaulted by 4 armed Neanderthals can overcome their fight/flight instinct to play Simon says with their attackers. Thats a basic human behavior. \n\nYou are not a good cop when you excuse criminal behavior by your colleagues. People like you are the problem. Clean your house.",

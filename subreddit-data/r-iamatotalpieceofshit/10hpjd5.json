Is that possible or is my memory just wrong? I\u2019d assume it was acetylene because all that was in the area was a acetylene torch and a welder. There was another time when a student created an explosion and sent a metal rod straight through the wall into my shop teachers office, and I don\u2019t remember any black smoke either",

The hydrogen from the freshly popped balloon can only react with the oxygen around it, and since the oxygen is not mixed with the hydrogen from the beginning, you have a slower burn. If the hydrogen and oxygen were mixed together, you get a lot louder boom, as there is a lot more contact between the oxygen and hydrogen.",

Those balloons are much smaller than 22.4 liter and weigh a lot more than 3 grams.

Street vendors were everywhere.\n\nOnce or twice I saw a street full of them grab all their stuff and literally run because these enforcers were coming around.\n\nThing is, there's sometimes so many of them that they impede pedestrians..sometimes half the sidewalk or more is gone, leading to congestion. And it's along the entire street. And sometimes they leave trash behind.\n\nI used to try to support them...I figured these were poorer people trying to make money.So at the supermarket I would buy my good, but buy my veggies from the street vendors outside.\n\nThe supermarket people hated them because (a) They took up parking spots (b) They were messy (c) They lost some sales to them.\n\nAs soon as the enforcers/inspectors were gone, the people would come right back again. I believe they paid \"spotters\" to watch for them.\n\nIt seems sad what they did to this guy...he's not blocking the road, he doesn't have a cart, and people do like to buy balloons for their kids...",

Many of your same arguments can be placed towards people who drink and drive. They should unequivocally lose their license for a period of time, however in many places (such as the US), not being able to regain a license ever is sentencing them to be unable to work many jobs due to no alternatives being available for transportation. There are many people who fix their addictions after a DUI, and continue to be contributing members of a society. And repeated DUIs do lead to permanent revocation. Strict/harsher punishment has been proven to not lower incidents of crime categorically.",

I actually made it out in the end with no injuries, and they gave me about 6k more than what the car was actually worth - it was a sports car with engine, electrical, and body problems. Oh and my neighbor has an insurance scamming lawyer father so she came over when she saw it towed to my place to get me signed up. And we ended up fucking. Not a horrible series of events. \n\nEdit: Since I was asked- the car was a 2019 Civic Type R. Not a crazy badass car but it was cherry (when I got it)",

At first they were telling me i was at fault since i didnt hit the first car. So i explained to the judge to brace himself to see a lot more car accident cases because i'll be doing the same damn thing as the first car and never be at fault since they wont touch my car.. They saw the logic i guess cause i was rules 0% at fault.",

It was a super windy day, and we were on an area where there was a steep ~20 foot (6.1m) drop on the side. Essentially this was a small cliff, with nothing but cobbled rocks at the bottom. I was just standing less than shoulder width from the edge taking a panorama shot, and this dude walks up from behind me, passes me on the cliff side, and aggressively shoves me with his shoulder so that he would have more room to pass. I didn\u2019t notice him coming, due to having my back turned, and just all of a sudden got shoved. Had I reflexively pushed back as I often would whenever something like that happens, he would have fallen off the cliff, and likely would have broken some bones, or worse. He\u2019s lucky I had the consciousness to not allow that reflex to happen. Afterwords, I was stunned. I\u2019m sure he had to have known that what he did was already highly dangerous (walking on the edge of a cliff in high winds) and then he went and shoved me on top of that. SMH.",

But a selfish person not only tries to get away with things, a selfish person tries first and foremost to protect himself. Stopping in the middle of the highway is not protecting yourself.\n\nI live in a place where drivers see traffic laws as suggestions and a lot of the drivers are super selfish but still, drivers are more often than not quite skilled in their recklessness. They will block a small town street for a couple of minutes while they wait for their passenger to arrive. They will see a blocked intersection with a green light and still push through with the full knowledge that they will be left stranded in the middle blocking traffic. They will drive on the shoulder of the highway when there's a traffic jam because fuck everyone else. But I've never seen anyone stop on the highway because they missed an exit in the 23 years that I've been driving.\n\nI think that transitioning from small town driving to highway driving without understanding how highways or physics work plays an element here.",

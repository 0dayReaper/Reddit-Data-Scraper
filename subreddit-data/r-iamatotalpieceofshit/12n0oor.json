Ur avg person can have a pretty self-sustainable existence, but when ur constantly just teetering on the edge of society, the only thing keeping u from oblivion is ur rights.\n\nKeep in mind, homeless people dont live very long. Avg lifespan is 40-50. Whereas ur avg person lives to about 70-80. It's a horrid existence, only palatable to a mind without proper reason. \n\nAlso, it's just what happens if u allow a competition based society, in a world where u have to beat others to be on top, there HAS to be a rock bottom.",

There shouldn't be more rights to be 'let off' from crime because of one's background. Ideally if Jeff Bezoz commits a crime he should go to jail the same time as a homeless person, the dystopian society is when Jeff Bezoz doesn't go to jail and just pays his way out of jail.    \n\n\n2. I think maybe what you're suggesting is more support in terms of financial and housing and legal support? Not more rights. Yes certainly homeless people need more money, free quality legal support, free mental health services, free housing etc. However, they should not get away from any crime. If they commit it, they are responsible and they must serve their sentence appropriate to the crime.   \n\n\n3. Regarding their lifespan, I don't think this is relevant. Having a short lifespan doesn't justify any crime, or violence against another. Nothing in someone's background justifies violence against another, except for self-defence.   \n\n\n4. Competition based society doesn't mandate homelessness. You can have capitalist societies that have good functional social welfare systems that are honest, responsible and fair, and can redistribute wealth so that noone is below the poverty line.   \n\n\nAnyway overall, I think we're on the same line regarding the fact that homelessness needs a solution in America, and requires everyone to contribute. None of the events in the video had to happen.",

Think I was replying to the woman's final statement of \"it seems like they have more rights then us\" I'm not stating whether or not one should be charged with a crime, just that homeless people have more instances where their human rights are being violated because of.. their status.\n\n2. I feel it's important to note when a party inspires ire In a population for that population to be aware of the irrational nature, and that homelessness is not some paradise of higher status, but an affliction that warps the mind. \n\n3. I would state that what makes a government running a capitalist ideology do what u would say is a socialist transition, I'm speaking only of classic late game capitalism, and if we persisted without making ideological changes. If we altered the way the economic systems worked in the USA, yes, all those things would be possible. But it is not inherent to our governmental system, which more largely exists as an Oligarchy.",

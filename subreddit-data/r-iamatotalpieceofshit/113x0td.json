Beautiful wife and kids, owned his own business and home, etc. Worked his tail off to get there as well. \n\nStarting playing around with meth but he kept it from me, as he knew I didn\u2019t approve of that one bit. But, I found out later on and we all tried to get him to stop. \n\nAbout a year later he had lost everything. We pooled what we could and picked him up one day and took him to rehab. Thankfully, that took and he\u2019s been free from that crap ever since. He\u2019s remarried and has a good job again and is doing well. \n\nBut, wow, what a nasty drug. I couldn\u2019t believe it destroyed him so quickly.",

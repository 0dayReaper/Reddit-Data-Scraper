It's hard to comprehend how someone could commit such a heinous act, especially against a defenseless child. 52 years seems like a just sentence, but it's also hard to imagine that the defendant could potentially be released on parole after only 26 years. I hope that justice is truly served for this little boy and his family. May he rest in peace.",

Each hive can have around 50,000 bees in the summer time. That's a lot of bees that have been destroyed. Especially since a lot of species are endangered and this deals a massive hit to their numbers overall. \n\nThe man will also suffer because its a blow to both his finances and livelihood. Hopefully he'll recover and rebuild. \n\n(Edited since some people don't understand the contexts)",

Beehives at this time of year catch fire readily and burn rapidly.  Whoever did this probably did not get stung or if they did, only a few times.\n\nSource: beekeeper for 50 years.",

Someone was trying to breed bees better suited for tropical climates by interbreeding European and African honeybees but then they got out and mixed with the local bee population to make a bee variety that was super agressive and would swarm(abandon their home) a ton. Now Africanized bees have spread to the USA and I'm sure some time traveling beekeeper would love to get rid of them.",

Not that I'm an expert but with these things you have to breed certain types of bees for generations to get the traits you want, so by killing the bees you've eliminated several to many generations of advancement. Even if knowledge is retained or passed along to others, there is a practical bottleneck through the breeding process.",

It's mostly humans basically abusing them and a shit ton of pesticides in our environment and on our fields.  \n\n\nWild bees in an untouched environment tend to do pretty damn fine but the amount of wild fields with all kinds of plants on them has been reduced because of our farming habits. Now obviously the bees could pollinate the plants we grow but we also use pesticides on them and that kills the bees. Also large areas with all the plants in blossom at the same time means the bees really struggle throughout the rest of the year.  \n\n\nAnd bees we keep for honey? Well they struggle with mites. But not because those mites are something new or the bees don't know how to take care of them but research seems to suggest it is because they are constantly stressed out. Normally bees clean each other and kill those mites but bees of which the honey is taken regularly seem to do this way less than bees from which the honey is taken less frequently.  \n\n\nWe don't need some super bee. We need to reconsider what we humans are doing to the bees.",

She needs to stop producing fertilized eggs and shrink back down first. This takes days to weeks, not minutes, so is not a possible response to fire.\n\nA colony needs baby larvae or fertilized eggs to make a new queen.\n\nThese are also stuck in the colony and unable to leave.\n\nWithout a queen or larvae, workers cannot reproduce. If the queen and brood die, it doesn't matter how many workers live. So the workers defend and protect their hive to the last, because if they don't, they have no future anyway, and no purpose in existing.\n\nThe smoke disables them detecting their alarm pheromones (the banana-smelling one caused by stings) and has them go into survival mode- store honey in their crops, get to the brood, and start fanning to blow out the smoke and vent the heat.\n\nCovering the alarm pheromone and focusing on protecting brood from fire over protecting territory from other creatures are the two big ones for beekeepers. Them gorging on nectar that they'll swallow and regurgitate multiple times as part of the honey making process anyway isn't important.\n\nBut as a result, this means that colonies can't flee fires unless they have an unmated queen and no laying queen or brood. And no bee yard should have a box that has a fresh swarm in it with no brood unless they just captured it, and they wouldn't be putting wild-caught swarms in with a breeding program.\n\nUnfortunately, unless one of these colonies threw a swarm and that swarm survived nearby, this project is screwed. :C",

Provide them an environment with certain amounts of constrained space and you can get them to consistently build the same wax structures the same way. Most of beekeeping is exploiting the \"programming\" they use for survival.\n\nThey build wax combs from tiny secretions gathered off of their bodies, little flakes of wax. Even when just placing them down, the bees automatically make them into hexagons of fairly consistent size, even though it's being made on bare wood.\n\nThey will build this nest out and down until they reach a wall or floor, then start constructing another one. They don't care about things like a big picture or efficient use of space. They drop a few wax flakes, follow instructions that say \"If &lt;Home&gt;, add wax to nest.\" then they find a point that needs wax. If they are too close to an object they won't apply the wax. So by providing them a starting strip to build down from, we can control the combs they build- or we can even provide a full sized wax sheet for them to just build cells off of without having to construct the back of the cells themselves.\n\nWe use smoke to prevent them from getting too sting happy during inspection and harvest, exploiting the \"brood defense\" programming.\n\nWe exploit the fact that instead of killing off all the workers and drones and hibernating for the winter, the Queen and colony all have to live through the winter. They store flower nectar as fuel to get them through, and they don't store pollen anywhere near as much since they aren't going to be making babies during the winter and don't need the proteins.\n\nJust so happens that this stored flower nectar is kept in such a way that it's not only safe to eat, but high in calories and requires no extra effort to preserve beyond sticking it in a container that keeps water out.\n\nI'm done stonedrambling about my favorite bugs now though, check out 628dirtrooster, jpthebeeman, schawee, or any other Youtube beekeepers if you wanna know more. Personally, I'm a huge fan of videos of cutouts as well as maintenance and deciding on how to do splits and prevent swarming.",

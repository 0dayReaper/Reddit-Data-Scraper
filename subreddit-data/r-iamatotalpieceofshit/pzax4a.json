I'm not saying women are always ethical, but with more to lose, you can bet they would have at least tried to keep corruption to a minimum and actually did what we were training the men to do. This boots thing is just wow. Granted I don't think I have ever seen a picture of a woman in Afghanistan in boots, let alone tall boots. And considering they want women covered from head to the floor, how would they even know? So are they going to ban scented soap? Oh she smells like Dove! This just looks like an SNL weekend update skit done in poor taste.",

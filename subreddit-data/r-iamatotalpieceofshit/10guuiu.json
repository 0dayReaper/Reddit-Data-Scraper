I saved up all of my money forever to buy a gameboy advanced when it came out. it was my first game boy. I always played pokemon on my n64 at home. I used the game pak to play pokemon red and yellow on my tv. My parents didn't get me a gameboy ever. So when I heard about GBA I started saving birthday and lawn mowing money. I was hooked on that thing.",

But to ignore the very well-researched links between IQ and life outcomes actually hurts those with low IQ more because it causes people to believe that we don\u2019t have to do anything to help and support them. \n\nBeing flagrantly wrong in this case is actually harmful to the very people you\u2019re probably intending on protecting.",

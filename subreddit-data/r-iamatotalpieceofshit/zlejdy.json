That was a complete disaster.  I would have needed a mop, bucket and copious amount of cleaner. It was all u could do to high tail it out of there b4 I got caught.  \n\nAgain, if u see my original comment....I do feel bad for whoever had to clean it up. But what can I do.  Plus, this was Cancun so I imagine this type of this happens often.",

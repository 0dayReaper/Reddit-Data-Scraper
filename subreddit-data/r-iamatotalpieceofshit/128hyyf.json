We also all also very capable of evil, often with some constructed justifications.\n\nBeing good is a HARD choice. When your environment or your reactivity fosters anger and violence, you have nothing but your will power, integrity and strength to be good.\n\nYou cant imagine yourself doing what theyre doing because youre not in their shoes. Which tells me you would do the exact same thing. The only preople who would truly not do the same are those who know they would and actively think about how to he a better person and plan and work for it.\n\nBeing good amidst evil is extremely difficult.",

He's pretty upset about it and keeps telling me about how he got his head stepped on. The anger I felt when I first heard about it was surreal. Instant, primal feeling rage was inside me, and I had to calm myself down, realizing the person that hurt him was only a 4 or 5 year old lol.",

I wouldn't be rude about it, but I'd definitely want to involve the other parents at that point. They need to know that their kids at that age are being bullies and stepping on heads is no joke. That's quite aggressive behavior. I was bullied but luckily it was never physical. I remember one kid in middle school got slung across the hallway and knocked into my knees which knocked me to the ground while it was at my locker...\n\nAlso, I can totally understand your anger.",

Thank god for my Spanish speaking brother, they backed off when he pleaded with them that it was my first day in MX. Got out of there with 20 USD less in our pockets.. very scary",

He was talking about theistic monarchies (Pope/King). I also feel it's a bit hypocritical for a Catholic Baron married to a Countess to weigh in on power and corruption by saying essentially \"power corrupts\". Taken at its face this means that Lord Acton, his ilk and his god are all corrupt. I do agree with the point he was trying to make, he just made it poorly at least by today's standards.",

When mom couldn\u2019t take care of herself anymore, my sister asked me to quit my job and move in with mom, in little town USA. I laughed at her. So, rather than moving mom into her own home, she put her in a home. \n\nTBH She checked on her often, took her out once a week, and did her laundry for her. Mom had dementia and a heart problem. She lived into her 90\u2019s. If she was at all mistreated I am sure my sister would have brought the hammer down.",

It has the normal big building where the elderly have their rooms but outside the building they had this sorta community area with houses for the elderly with their spouses. He was really happy there he never complained and the only time he got upset was when my mum and I visited and a nurse came in (he didn\u2019t like us being interrupted) last time I saw him he was peacefully asleep in his bed when we visited last I\u2019m pretty sure he pasted in his sleep a week after we saw him.",

The carers shoved her in a dark room with no windows and a bed that was very hard to get her out of (she needed a hoist) and left her without food or drink for hours. Within those 4 days she developed awful bed sores from not being turned. She had a catheter and her bag was rarely changed so she developed a bladder infection. It was not our choice to put her in a care home, the authorities put her there whilst her usual careers sorted out her care plan, which took 3 months. Before grandma went in a home, my aunt flew over from South Africa to take care of her but due to her own physical health, could no longer take the strain of lifting my grandma into her chair every day and other things she had to do. This is why I\u2019m studying for a degree in Social Work, to hopefully be someone to make positive changes to the lives of people like my grandma.",

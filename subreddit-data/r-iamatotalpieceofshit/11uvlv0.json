If a giant corporation with bottomless piles of money decides to sue a grandma living on social security for everything she has, wouldn't you want her to have a competent attorney appointed?\n\nObviously this isn't anywhere near the same scenario, but the point is that every defendant should have an attorney, and those attorneys are and should be required to do their best to represent their client. What would you propose as an alternative?",

Depriving your brain of oxygen (hypoxia) leads to a feeling of euphoria, hence why huffing (whippits) makes one feel good and is generally bad for the overall health.  \n100% oxygen is created from a chemical reaction when the masks are used and lasts for only about 10-15 minutes.\nI'm not a medical professional, so my limited reading on it shows that 100% oxygen saturation is only really a problem at increased air pressures, which is not a problem at airplane elevations (the opposite, in fact).\nSo without the increased oxygen from the masks you are more likely to go hypoxic,  possibly eventually feeling euphoric and make bad decisions. With it, you are more likely to keep your thought processes, however terrified they are.",

A month later he instructs lawyers to sue, they expect him to get $100,000 for his own pain and suffering to date.  \n\nBefore the matter reaches the courts, the guy dies.  That $100,000 claim doesn't just die with him, it's part of his estate.\n\nHere they're arguing that there's no way of proving that the passengers suffered enough to have such a claim immediately before their deaths.  There may very well be separate claims for pain and suffering of the families in addition to that, as well as other things - e.g. if someone who was killed always did the gardening and DIY the familiy might be able to sue for  someone to come in and do these things.",

Without going into too much detail, the malfunction causing the dive was in a 15 second on, 10 second off (iirc, numbers might be off) pattern. The pilots could briefly regain control and attempt to level off the plane and climb, but ultimately couldn't stop the crash. \"Nose dive\" might also evoke a steeper than actual descent, as the public might take it to mean near-vertical. I vaguely remember one of the crashes being in a 45-degree dive (which is very, very steep for a commercial airliner), but have no source so take that with a grain of salt.",

Older aircraft grow more prone to failure with age, and following the crashes the 737 max was subject to the longest grounding in FAA history. Even if you don't trust the FAA's recertification due to their role in the initial coverup, pretty much every other aviation authority in the world did so as well.\n\nI also think asking how much reversion to 737 NG would cost you is a somewhat callous way of looking at it; efficiency improvements over the whole fleet result in millions of dollars in fuel savings per year and significantly reduced emissions.",

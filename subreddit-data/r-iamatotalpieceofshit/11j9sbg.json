However they talked her into taking all of them and the driver relented. but the facepalm part of that when she drove them to her destination, instead of being grateful she bent the rules for them, they ended up beating her and stealing her tip box for having the audacity to attempt to follow the law.\n\nwhat\u2019s even more crazy is that the first attacker got pissed at the Uber driver that her fake nails broke after she repeatedly assaulted the Uber driver in the face",

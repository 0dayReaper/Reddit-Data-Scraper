She stated that everything she had grown had died, and she couldn\u2019t re-plant either because everything just kept dying. But apparently people are giving her tips on how to unsalt as much as possible, and she\u2019s even had a few offers from farmers and such in the area to come and help her through the process.",

At the same time I like how many have been prepared to donate, advise and replace for her. \n\nNot quite the same but my partner took her car to the local mechanic and asked for them to give it a once over and to change the tyres as she was giving it to a friend who was having a tough time but had got a job after a long long search. When she went to collect they\u2019d put four tyres on and changed the brake pads, windshield wipers etc and charged her \u00a330. Since they reckoned if GF was paying it forward they would too. The next day the guy that\u2019ll drive to your house to clean your car inside and out said he\u2019d seen Mr C (the mechanic) and he\u2019d mentioned about the car - since Mr C was prepared to help out, so was he, provided she could hand over the keys at lunchtime? He waxed it and everything. By the time Friend got that car, it was like half the village had decided to wish him luck in his new job. \n\nTo salt the ground of this woman who\u2019s clearly Good People took one, maybe two wankers. Raising \u00a3200,000, taking the mechanry to remove the topsoil and donates more has likely taken a thousand Good People.  The odds are still in our favour.",

Someone who window watches. I would bet they\u2019re near by. They might interact with the owner. Someone who does this enjoys that sort of kick out of running a layered deception. \n\nWhat a miserable human.",

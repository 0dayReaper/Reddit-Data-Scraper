He was never in the military, in any branch.  When questioned in court he did the old song and dance talking about what he's \"certified in\" and was a PMC  for the US govt (in the hopes I assume if he \"basically did the same job as the military\", it wouldn't really be stolen valor).  Yet when questioned he couldn't even remember the name of the PMC he worked for, so even that is bullshit.  It's funny because he was able to rapid fire names of PMC's he DIDN'T work for lmao.  Like Bro how can you remember the names of all the PMC's you didn't work for, but not remember the one you did work for.",

She was telling me about a nephew who had been arrested again for impersonating a cop; it was the first time I\u2019d heard of it  and, at first, I couldn\u2019t understand what she was telling me. Apparently her nephew was in his mid 20s and it was the fourth time he was popped for impersonation. He had never tried to join up but went around stopping people, writing tickets, etc and was unable/unwilling to stop. In the end he got five years to contemplate his actions.",

He bought retired police vehicles and modified them just enough to be legally acceptable. The police department even assigned a detective to work specifically with him and there's a video where he was arguing that his lights are technically purple and orange. Another where he is open carrying a pepper ball gun with a flashlight and he tells the cop \"it's a pepper ball gun you know that\" like the officer is supposed to know exactly who he is. He can't be a police officer cause he's a register sex offender for having sex with a minor 12-15 years old and was arrested for failing to register his address. He served 15 months in prison for impersonating a police officer and was released in September 2022 just to be arrested again in November for violating his probation. He said that it was for not deleting his YouTube channel but he said the account was stolen.\n\nEdit: Name removed.",

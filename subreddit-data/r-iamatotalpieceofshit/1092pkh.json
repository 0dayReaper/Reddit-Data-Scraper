Second, no police forces have been defunded. If anything most of them have gotten more funding because of liberal mayor's fearing backlash. \n\nIf there is any increase in crime, such as in 2021, it is because of covid, income inequality, poor education, and lack of enriching environments. \n\nI'm sorry to tell you, but police do not prevent crime to any substantial amount. Crime would actually be reduced if a less was spent on police and more on social programs.",

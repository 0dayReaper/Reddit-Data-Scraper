I would drop it behind the top of the 6ft shelf where it fell to the bottom in the direct center. The only way to retrieve it was with a bent hanger I kept under my bed.\n\nI was a good kid. I didn\u2019t do drugs, drink, or even make prank phone calls. My mother was cruel and cold - and my diary was the only safe space I could write those feelings down.\n\nShe still doesn\u2019t get it and snoops through my things when she\u2019s at my house.",

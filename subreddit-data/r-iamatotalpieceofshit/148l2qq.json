He has been raising money to donate for dog shelters and dreams to get a dog ( the family dog passed away a long time ago) but his parents are not down for that yet, so he makes money for the benefit of all dogs for the shelter. \n\nAlso he has worn a bowtie and a hat for as long as I can remember, it\u2019s just his style. PS he is not a \u201crich white boy\u201d. You would find different articles about his work since he was four years old about his different business endeavors to help dog shelters, people and reporters find him interesting.\n\nNot to mention you can fact check the shelters that have received the money from his other work, he always mentions the exact percentage of the profits he gives away to charity. And has always done so, on his web site and on his coffee / lemonade stands. \nSo for once, I know with certainty that all the cynics that sow doubt on this tender sweet boy and all the shelter doggies he has helped, are not only wrong but also should check inside themselves about why is their vision of the world so dark and corrupt. \nHis parents are very successful people in their own right and I believe they are in awe of his natural altruistic light. And are not interested in deceiving anyone but rather nourish and cultivate his giving entrepreneurial spirit!",

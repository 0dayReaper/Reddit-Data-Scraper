I didn't even bother to look at the writing on its harness because I was sure it said no petting, but luckily my girlfriend read it. It said \"please pet me\"! Her name is Copper and she's a therapy dog with the PHL Wagging Tails Brigade and just walks around the airport looking for some love from strangers. The person caring for her even gave us a little playing card with info about her on it, it was so cute and definitely made our travels brighter.\n\nBut yeah, pretty much every other kind of working dog you can't pet and you're not even supposed to talk to them or try to interact with them.",

The idea of it is to quickly change directions every time the dog walks ahead of you. The dog will reach the end of the leash and be jerked around until the dog eventually learns that walking too far from the handler results in discomfort. \n\nAnd like... it works, *technically.* When you do it correctly. A harness isn't going to achieve it because it doesn't cause the level of discomfort a collar would. (You'd use a prong collar for this.) This method relies on positive punishment, something the dog finds uncomfortable applied to reduce a behaviour. \n\nBut you could also shove treats into the dogs face every time he looks at you and stays close to you and get the same response with a lot less struggle. Not to mention this dog isn't even pulling and forging ahead? There's nothing to train here?",

That being said, if he is attempting to train, it should be known to any professional in dog handling that there are better methods to do even this kind of training. When we used it on our husky, we used a self-tightening collar and she got mild tugs on the collar before a turn so if she was behaving she wouldn't feel any discomfort at all. That way when we wanted her to turn with her regular leash the same light tugs notified her to watch for a turn without any discomfort. But she was an exceptional case because she was a terrible walker and treats just weren't working. She was smart enough to only do what you wanted when she saw you had a treat, so she was just gaming us",

The first rule of training is to take a step back and let yourself decompress, training has no benefit when the handler is upset, you make mistakes and create bad habits.  He's also using a harness when it should be a collar.  Also you shouldn't be training this while actively working the dog there's a time and place for that.  These dogs have a limit to how long they can effectively work and these places that employ dogs always overwork them, especially new dogs that don't have the energy to work all day yet.  But in my opinion TSA handlers are bottom of the barrel with few exceptions, no one wants to work for them but that's how you get your foot in the door in an incredibly hard to get into job field.",

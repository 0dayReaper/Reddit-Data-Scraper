Someone doesn't get along well with the management there, they start building up a paper trail and giving them jobs and instructions that can easily be misinterpreted, then writing them up when they make a mistake (or in one instance, was explicitly told the wrong thing to do, but still writing them up because they were trained the correct way several years earlier and should have not listened to their supervisor). If they point out that others make similar mistakes, they just say that those people are not on performance improvement plans, so don't need the same level of scrutiny. The kicker was it was a union job, just the union let this kind of stuff happen, rarely fighting it.",

Yes, they do pay below minimum wage\u2026 but that\u2019s because of the horrendous SSI/SSDI income requirements that keep the disabled from working. For every $1 you make while on SSI the government take 50 cents away. If you make enough that you run out of SSI, they take away your disability status which means you lose your healthcare and drug coverage, not to mention any other welfare things you qualify for due to being on SSI. In states with no state funding for SSI you only get $914 a month which means you can only make about $1500 (giving a padding for extra shifts and overtime  that jobs often require). A lot of jobs these days pay more than $1500 a month because they need you to work a certain hours of days and hours. They also aren\u2019t as accommodating to disabilities. If you can\u2019t work due to illness they find a way to fire your. Goodwill might not be great but their system allows disabled people to work when they government has more or less forced them into unemployed or risk their healthcare. I think goodwill would be better if they just provided them healthcare but that\u2019s something Americans seem hella afraid off",

To make matters worse, they didn\u2019t have enough parking for employees, so we had to park in this building a couple miles away and catch their shuttle to the office, so add more time. If you worked at 11am, you had to be in your seat, logged in, have read all your email cause they would concern offers or problems out there for why people may be calling, and taking a call at 11a or you were late. There wasn\u2019t a swipe in to work, your time was literally marked by the phone system when you turned in on for the first call. At lunch, you had to wait for the shuttle to take you to your car, so there was another 15 you weren\u2019t getting, (they just said you don\u2019t HAVE to go out for lunch so that\u2019s not their problem) then had to make sure you found a spot at the call center after lunch cause there was no shuttle at night if you were off past 6p. If there was no parking, you had to park on the streets nearby which weren\u2019t all that safe. Many employees had their car broken into while they worked. Their policy was \u201cit\u2019s your responsibility to make sure you are here in time to take care of your personal automobile, get logged in, read the emails etc so you are \u201cready\u201d for work.\u201d\n\nThis was back around 2009. When I started, they were hiring at $15 an hour. By the time I left, there was a recession, so they took advantage and we\u2019re hiring at lower and lower hourly rates, looking for reasons to fire those making more per hour. I believe they were down to 8.50 an hour in 2012 and it showed by the quality of those answering the phone. \n\nI believe there was a class action for all of this, everyone got like a whopping $100 cause class action and all.",

We have different employee rights but I wouldn't say we have significantly more protections. One of the main differences is that we have easier access in some cases to unemployment insurance payments as well as rights around parental leave and caregiver leave. Sick leave and sick days are a joke, there is no such thing as guaranteed number of hours. Most employers give some benefits for full time- but full time here doesn't start until 35 hours a week. Most employers will schedule between 30-34 a week purposely to avoid paying into benefits. Disability accommodations for work and school are mostly a joke. An employer will often just not schedule you or schedule you for like 2 or 4 hours a week instead of actually firing you- and it's legal. Childcare is really expensive unless you find a subsidy spot(sliding scale based on income) but those are few and far between. \n\nWe are proud of our system. There is a lot great about it, but like most systems for anything, there is also a lot of \"areas of opportunity\" that are not ideal. Especially lately.",

The labor relationship is already adversarial, so any time you're out of line *per the contract*, you're liable to be disciplined until that discipline can be escalated to termination *per the disciplinary terms of the contract*.  Does the contract say you can be disciplined for being one minute late?  Then it's fair game.  Can you argue retaliation?  Perhaps, but you'll need to show a pattern of behavior by subpoenaing the timeclock and discipline records, and, even then, if being one minute late is against policy, you still might have no case as long as contractual procedure was followed.  The timeclock software already handles some of this by providing the ability to escalate frequent late punches for review",

            "comment": "New York thinks it\u2019s so fucking progress and yet they cling to this notion of being a \u201cright to work\u201d state like it\u2019s their fucking Bible. Also they guard access to healthcare for the working poor like nothing I\u2019ve seen in a supposedly blue state. There is a huge gap between the wage when you lose access to free healthcare and the wage that buying any coverage at all on the marketplace, let alone something comparable, is feasible. Fucking fantastic state to live in if you\u2019re wealthy, though.\n\nEDIT: Sorry I meant \u201cat will\u201d, not \u201cright to work\u201d",

If pops had a union backing him, ol howie wouldn't have had to live in poverty as a kid. his story should be an inspiration, coming up from the lowest low and rising to the top, but it's not because of people like him. Now unless you are born wealthy it's very unlikely you ever will be.",

We were told we needed to wrap up because he would be in the office....on the way out I farted at the door. I ate hard boiled eggs for breakfast. I'd like to think it lingered long enough to pollute those nostrils.",

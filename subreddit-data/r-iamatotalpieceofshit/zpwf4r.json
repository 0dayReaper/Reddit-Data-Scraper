Marriage is most likely on the decline because it's not as important as it once once. In fact, it's probably women who are choosing not to marry men as frequently as they once did, not the other way around. That's not because of any gender being inherently worse, but rather the fact that women are now able to be independent of men; have careers, buy property, have their own bank accounts, etc, and we're just now realizing we don't *need* to be married. Women were basically forced to marry at one point, and as we slowly get further away from the generations who insist it's important, we'll see less and less marriages. There are certainly men who also don't want to marry due to the fear that a woman will \"come out on top\" during divorce, so simply living with a partner indefinitely is safer than marriage. Still, women being \"free\" is probably the biggest reason marriage is on the decline. \n\nPersonally, I'm married. Happily married for 15 years in fact. But I also don't think marriage is important. Who cares if it's on the decline?",

Diamond prices are artificially inflated by the De Beers group, by controlling the supply of diamonds on the market.  \n\nThat's why diamond jewelry instantly loses value as soon as it leaves the store.  If you want precious stones that won't lose value look for rubies, sapphires or emeralds.  They won't cost you as much to aquire and they will retain their value when you leave the store",

This resulted in her staying with me at my folks place for a bit while I was between housing. For some reason she decided it would be a good idea to go through my stuff and found an engagement ring. The look on her face when I let her know it wasn't for her was priceless. Truth is that after college I made a bad choice and proposed to someone I was dating. Thankfully she said no and frankly I wasn't able to get the money back for the ring and at the time didn't need the money enough to sell it for a loss.",

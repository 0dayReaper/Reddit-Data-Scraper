They want only the wealthiest men, to attract only the most beautiful women, and vice versa. They want the men who show up with 3 women with them and tip staff like crazy and get table and bottle service.\n\nIf clubs had no screening procedures, they wouldn\u2019t be \u201chot\u201d\n\nSo is it okay to discriminate against ugly girls? Fat girls? Tell me what discrimination is acceptable in your view.\n\nMy point, no discrimination is acceptable.\n\nYour point, some discrimination is acceptable.",

Either way, the bar has to take accountability for its employee.\n\n&gt; Yes, ofc the owner says that he will maybe fire the bouncer. In south africa we have pretty strict labour laws and people can't just get fired. On top of that, he is just being a good boss and isn't just trusts what these guys are saying in the moment and maybe wants to discuss the issue with the bouncer in private when there isn't some young guy constantly shouting and not letting the dude speak.\n\nI disagree.\n\nIf the allegations about the bouncer are true, then this is a very bad owner who didn't properly vet his employees and who did not do enough to rectify the situation.\n\nIf the bouncer was fired, then that's a good start. If the bouncer has a different story, let's hear it!",

A small flatbed truck went by with something tied up and covered with large black tarps. A black guy ran up to the truck and tried to peek under the tarp. He was gunned down by 2 white plainclothes police in less than a second. My dad said the cops didn\u2019t provide first aid, just stood and watched the guy bleed out.  My dad and his boss finished up the tour of the factory they went to inspect and got on the next plane back to Canada never to return.  Some locals explained that this was a pretty common occurrence.",

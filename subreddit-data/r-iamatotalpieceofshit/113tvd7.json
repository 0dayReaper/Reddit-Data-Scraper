What you are doing here, is not a good argument as to why they indeed deserved it, you are making a good argument against democracy.\n\nYou may not gloat at what is happening, but you are just a tiny bit less worse than those who do, who likely are of your same opinions most of the time, because who would gloat at what is happening in Ohio?\n\nWith that said, I hope you will enlighten yourself on what morality actually means, better, to actually act morally.",

It's like when any natural disaster happens in the south, they see that state rescue efforts are subpar, then take the high horse of saying \"those ignorant southerners got what's coming, shouldn't have voted red \ud83d\ude44.\" It's inhumane and only pushes those who vote further from your side due the lack of basic humanity you possess.

Like, one \"good\" adult in an abused kids life can make a huge difference in shaping their recovery. Or, when a society is relatively averse to those types of behaviors. Like, DV is still present in the US, but it's criminalized and frowned upon. In Russia, it's not a criminal act to beat your wife, and I'd wager even encouraged upon in some areas. When every adult in your life, and the society you live in, tells you this horrific act isn't \\*that bad\\* it's hard to break away from those cycles. That, and mental-health help isn't as prevalent in Russia, so even if they do have a \"I need help\" moment or a \"I want to change\" moment, the resources to help them do-so are limited and frowned upon in their society. Russia conditions the perfect environment/layout for abusive cycles to continue.",

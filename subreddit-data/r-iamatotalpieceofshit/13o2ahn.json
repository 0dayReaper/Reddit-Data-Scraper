Ever since I've lived here she has scurried away like a scared rabbit every time she spots me coming. If she's going for a smoke and I open the door, she will go back inside. \n\nMeth is my best guess. I've never spoken a word to this woman, only the older dude that lives in their 2 bedroom condo with her and a handful of other people.

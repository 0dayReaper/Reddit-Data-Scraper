Didn't need to gender it at all, if gender weren't functional within his statement.\n\nConsider it as a comparator: it wouldn't make sense to say both \"it's common for men to (whatever verb),\" and \"it's common for women to (same verb).\"\n\nIf you believed both, you'd simply say \"it's common for people to ().\" As the OP gendered the opinion, the gender is intended to function a comparator (or, I guess, OP writes extremely poorly and superfluously).\n\nSo it's a gendered statement, that skirting is responsibility is more common for women.\n\nSo as it is both a negative stereotype, for which the subject is gendered, and so (true or not), it's a sexist statement",

She was determined to get out of here, out of the parking lot.\"\n\nDespite initial reports than more than 20 people were injured in the incident, LASD says that two people sustained minor injuries, for which they were treated at the scene. \n\nThe suspect was also treated for minor injuries before she was arrested.\n\nAt least five cars, including the stolen vehicle, sustained damage during the course of the rampage. \n\nThe woman has been taken into custody and booked for carjacking.",

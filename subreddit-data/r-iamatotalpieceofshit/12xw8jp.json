Many times the joggers will ignore and/or avoid the sidewalks as well, which I will never understand (cyclists are told to stay off the sidewalks). \n\nThe issue is that I live in New England. The roads can\u2019t be made wider, and everything is a hill and/or a blind curve where the speed limit varies between 40-50 mph. It\u2019s infuriating. This past weekend I drive an hour to a friends house and there was a pack of cyclists (literally about 20 of them) on this windy, hilly backroad just asking to become a collective hood ornament. I get that they\u2019re training, and the road is scenic, etc. but there\u2019s surely a safer way to do it. Traffic was unbelievably backed up with no real way off this road and onto another.",

I would defend this guy if that particular area didn't have port o potty's everywhere. People don't realize that when the shits are coming, the shits are coming. I've seen people crawling across the finish line with blankets covering their backsides because of losing their bowels. I kind of have respect for the people that still finish and for the people that give them dignity by covering them up. It looks like he tried to find a pretty private place but it's still fucked up, especially when the toilets are right nearby. He could've at least use a fucking poop bag if he's going to act like a dog.",

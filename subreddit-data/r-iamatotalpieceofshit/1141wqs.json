Many times they pull someone over for the most minor of infractions like a license plate light not working and they use it as an excuse to chase criminality on average citizens. This leads to citizens being nervous, apprehensive, or hostile. Then they use that behavior that they elicited as further cause to extract you from the vehicle to do a Terry frisk, and to try and search your car or to make you do field sobriety test knowing you\u2019re not impaired. \n\nIt\u2019s bad enough they have gone from public safety to public piracy because their oversized departments rely on the revenue from citations and seizures. Now they are rewarded and commended for turning traffic stops into criminal arrests. They are the public enemy in todays times. Anyone who\u2019d say why are you nervous, or mad to insinuate you\u2019re a criminal is definitely not there for your benefit. A fair cop would want to dispel your fears. They would assure you it\u2019s a traffic stop and not anything to be nervous of. They\u2019d give a citation or warning and send you on your way. That\u2019s no longer who they are and why you are told by every lawyer not to answer questions because they\u2019re looking to trip you up so they have the RAS to violate your rights when you likely did absolutely nothing wrong in a majority of traffic stops. Most won\u2019t even tell you who they are, they say it\u2019s right here and point at a name or get mad you asked like you had any authority on their stop. It\u2019s disgusting what law enforcement has become. Hell call them for a home burglary or theft and see if they\u2019re here to \u201chelp you\u201d or not.",

If a cop pulled me over for let's say an expired inspection (this has actually happened) and I knew that was literally it, nothing to get stressed over. Unfortunately, as you said, it's can also mean they're gonna try to tack on more things. I've personally been incredibly lucky with all police interactions, though I keep a level head and am very respectful, I get they have a job to do and I also know that the best way to fight is in court, not in the street. But, this doesn't apply for all, on both ends. I live in a rural area, our police are actually respected and supported by the community. That said, drive an hour south and your in a higher crome rate area amd the cops aren't exactly the most friendly",

You are not required to identify yourself unless you are suspected of a traffic violation or committing a crime. _However_ you are required to have a driver's license when in operation of a motor vehicle.

You can fight for the violation of your rights later when you're not in a dangerous situation. My whole point with this was without more context, we do not know if the request for ID was a lawful order and the woman isn't inherently wrong to refuse to give ID.\n\nIt is the cops job to remain calm in the face of difficult civilians.

I don't know if this woman was ever driving so I'm not sure the while operating a vehicle part applies here. And in Texas, it's actually very similar just with the gun part added. They can ask, but only required when arrested, when suspected crime/violation, and when you got a gun.\n\nYour honesty is very refreshing and I very much appreciate that you understand what that woman waa dealing with. I don't have kids so I have no idea myself how I would react but I'd probably comply regardless.

The downside (well one of them) is that it leads to very aggressive responses from officers in situations where it is completely unwarranted. Sure there\u2019s a degree of them having to take control due to the danger to their lives (we have extremely high rates of weapon possession by criminals in the USA,) but it also leads to some pretty outrageous circumstances.\n\nIn theory, our system would be fine if it ran correctly. You simply comply with police officers and any issues will be sorted out and corrected in court. In reality it doesn\u2019t work that way at all. There\u2019s various corruption between the various branches of the justice system (including the judges, it\u2019s not exclusively police,) and for a variety of issues it can be near impossible to truly fight for justice. Hell, I could be in my right to fight some frivolous charge yet if I end up in jail a couple days I could lose my job, not to mention having to cough up thousands of dollars in court fees/attorney costs. \n\nIt\u2019s a huge mess and I\u2019m not really sure what the solution to fix it would even look like. I don\u2019t think anyone really knows either. There\u2019s a lot of push for police reform but the judicial and corrections side of the justice system also need a lot of reform. Whilst there\u2019s push for correctional reform I really don\u2019t see or hear much about the court side of things. You can\u2019t fix the system without reforming all 3, and in a lot of regards the judicial system needs reform the most since any reform to the other branches of the justice system are dependent on the courts functioning properly and justly.",

I know we definitely have some corruption in the local departments (where isn\u2019t there?) but they don\u2019t strike me as power hungry. \n\nFrom his verbiage it sounds like a failure to identify, whilst she\u2019s claiming like he didn\u2019t understand what she said. I don\u2019t think failure to identify is generally grounds for arrest unless there\u2019s suspicion involved (ie: person with warrants, crime committed, under influence etc.) Regardless it comes across that she\u2019s been ignoring commands and resisting arrest from before the video started, which just puts you into more problems. At that point he more than likely would be cleared to use force but is definitely showing restraint. \n\nI think a lot of people don\u2019t understand the self defense aspect of what he did here. There\u2019s documented cases of two unarmed people overpowering an officer and killing them with their own service weapon, and that\u2019s not isolated to being big burly men, a scrawny teenage girl could still contribute to that. I can\u2019t really speak on the gun stance as I have very limited time using handguns, but it strikes me as being a stable position whilst still allowing him wide visibility - he\u2019s not going full \u2018gangster\u2019 with it lol.",

            "comment": "Interesting how divided this thread is. You don\u2019t try to plead your case while a cop is putting on handcuffs. The merits of your arrest can be debated in front of a judge. Taking a aggressive position on a cop who is trying to arrest someone will always get an equally aggressive response.",

By the time you face a judge, who, by the way, probably isn't a better human being than the cop, it's already too late. \n\nThis cop should at least be fired, at best be in jail for abusing his power. \n\nResisting arrest maybe shouldn't be a crime.

What we really need is a training safety course in school on how to deal and behave with cops in things like traffic stops.  What to say, your rights, being assertive but not loud and aggressive and swearing at cops etc. That could prevent shootings based on misunderstandings.\n     It was wrong to pull the gun on a child but if an adult got out of a car during an arrest he would do the same thing.  He's legitimately afraid he's going to be jumped.  Probably has been jumped before like this.\n      The tragic example is the man who reported an accident on the highway and got out of his vehicle carrying a wallet.  The troopers took getting out of the vehicle as aggression and mistook the wallet as a gun. Again misunderstanding that led to tragedy.",

Very stressful situation here, cause as the cop states, he doesn't know who they are. Now the cop is struggling with a very combative suspect, and sees someone step out from behind the vehicle. He can't release the person being cuffed, and he's in an awkward angle, so he draws his gun and tells the person to go get back inside. The cop remains extremely calm, and the reason why he's holding his gun somewhat sideways is either because he's using the Center Axis Relock, which has you holding the gun at a 45 degree angle, or because he is using one arm to lean and press down on the driver, so he wouldn't be holding it straight from the view of the camera. Again, no context, so I'm only breaking down what can be seen from this video.",

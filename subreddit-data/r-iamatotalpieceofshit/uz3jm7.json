Multiple fellas from other cars, buses, and local shops came over shouting \"oi, oi, geez, bloody hell\" before rocking the car like they were trying to tip it over until the driver switched the engine off. No-one there was trying to calm that driver down. Rather they were looking to smash windows, drag them out, and give them a strongly worded letter of fists to the nuts. Police were there pretty quickly as we were close to a mainline train station.\n\nI was fine anyway. Traffic meant they hadn't been able to build up enough speed for real damage. I could see them coming and was able to jump up so to not have my legs hit. I simply rolled over the bonnet, the roof, and landed on my feet. I slightly twanged my ankle though. Couldn't walk properly for like 5 mins.",

Asking a cop \"what's going on?\" would likely just get a stern \"THIS IS AN ACTIVE POLICE MATTER, I NEED YOU TO STEP BACK!\" with hand on gun.",

However, IME, it's not an exaggeration at all to say that the *majority of the time* approaching a police officer involves having to ***de-escalate*** the aggression from the officer before you can actually speak with them, and even then it is rare to have a conversation with an on-duty police officer that resembles a normal human-to-human interaction in any way shape or form... rather, *at best* you can really only hope to not feel like you're in *immediate* danger from the cop, and as far as I can tell that's how they seem to be trained to try and make you feel.",

A buddy of mine had to retire from the military because covid damaged his lung enough as to where he couldnt achieve the fitness standards. \n\nNot wearing a seatbelt also doesnt always result in death. But that doesnt mean we should all stop wearing seatbelts. \n\nAlso while it doesnt stop transmission due to the fact it reduces symptoms like coughing. And coughing bring increased risk of infecting others. So yeah it doesnt stop transmission but it lowers the chance of spreading.",

There are several currently in development. I believe Organics currently has the most promising one, but they are probably at least a year away from it being fully approved for human use. Mucosal immunity will mean no infections, no contagion. So, a total end to the pandemic for those who take the vaccine.",

A vaccine that doesn\u2019t prevent transmission doesn\u2019t prevent incubation or mutations.  This is because mutations occur when mistakes are made during the manufacturing of more viruses.  If a virus is able to multiply enough to move from person to person then it\u2019s had the chance to mutate tens of millions of times over.  And the entire process of hiding and multiplying is incubation, therefore if you transmit virus it\u2019s already been incubated in your body.  The vaccine only helps those who receive it by increasing their chances of surviving, nothing more.",

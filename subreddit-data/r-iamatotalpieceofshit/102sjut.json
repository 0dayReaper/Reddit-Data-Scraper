I can't imagine sitting in someone elses seats and they never show happens more than 1 out of 100 times.\n\nAt a recent trip to the theater, a family sat in peoples seats and employees had to be involved to get them to go to the seats they bought.  I couldn't hear everything completely but apparently what happened is the family waited to long too get tickets and couldn't get a block of seats, so they bought individual seats all over the theater and expected the employees to be on their side when they wanted to be accommodated.  They actually just ended up leaving (I don't know if they were told to leave) but they were putting up quite a fuss.",

I waited months for that movie and bought tickets way in advance. We walk in and there aren\u2019t any seats. There are people in my assigned seats.

The theater figured that because I bought mine online in advance that their system never marked them as sold so these people walked up and bought tickets for the same seats.

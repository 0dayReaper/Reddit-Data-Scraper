But I'm pretty sure 'internal monologue' involves basically thinking to your self, or when thinking/reading there is your voice that you can hear, in your head.",

Not even an idea worth taking seriously. Or if you were to take seriously it would be on the same level of *...what if metachlorines were actually real, though?\"* What's worse is in another comment I actually shared what my own personal thoughts on it were.",

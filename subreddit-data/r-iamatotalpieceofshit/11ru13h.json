I don't know what the school told them but I got bullied for years and didn't tell anyone until 10th grade. I don't think I understood how bad it was in comparison to how I should have been treated. It was just how things were. I remember being aware that if I told anyone it would be worse for me because then I'd get the bully in trouble and not only would we both get suspended but then I'd make myself a target once the suspension was over.\n\nLike a week after I told my mom I was taken out of the school district so I should have said something sooner",

I believe (maybe im being optimistic) some states have heavy charges for damaging medical equipment to protect service animals.\n\nThis would probably run the risk of being considered a hate crime since usually someone in a wheelchair has a legally recognized disability which makes them a protected class.\n\nEdit:  It looks like Pennsylvania is one of the worst states there is in regards to protections for someone with a disability.  \n\n\nEdit2:  In Pennsylvania, a hate crime is an offense that causes physical harm to the victim, or an offense that threatens to commit harm to a victim or group, that is motivated by race, religion, ethnic/national origin, gender, gender identity, age, ***disability*** or sexual orientation of the victim(s).",

Since when is it ok to destroy someone's only means of transportation? These chairs are not cheap and have many parts that can easily break. If it's bent whatsoever, it's unusable. My chair alone new costs over 12k. Please be kind to people who use wheelchairs. We didn't ask for it but get left with learning a whole new way to live. When we're out in the world that's good. Most stay home. We just want to live our best lives with what's been given us. Same as everyone else.",

If this guy had gotten into someone else\u2019s car and ramped it into a building to destroy the car he would be charged.\n\nI would think this would be similar to theft, were the item that he destroyed was worth more than a certain amount of money and therefore it is not a misdemeanor but a felony.\n\nCan someone explain to me why the theft and destruction of this girls expensive piece of property is not being considered a serious crime?",

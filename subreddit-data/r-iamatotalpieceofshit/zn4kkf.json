We get there, it\u2019s downtown of a nice sized city and there\u2019s this building with a big ole sign, can\u2019t remember what exactly it said but we thought it was the place we were looking for; they purposely made it look like an abortion clinic. \n\nWe go inside and my wife tells them that she has an appointment and they act like they were expecting her. They immediately want to separate us. They bring us to a room and then they tell me that I can\u2019t wait there with her. Ok, I guess. Remember, we thought we were at the place we were looking for, and did not even know that these places existed at the time, so none of this was weird in the moment. \n\nThey start to try to talk my wife out of the abortion, trying to have her sign papers, would not let her leave the room, would not come and get me like she asked them to. She starts getting freaked, calls me and tells me to come to the room she\u2019s in and threatens to call the cops on the people holding her hostage when they wouldn\u2019t unlock the door and let me in. They finally \u201clet\u201d her leave. \n\nTurns out this place is directly kiddy corner from the clinic we were looking for. Fucking predatory fucks set up their little abduction office right by the abortion clinic and made it look like an abortion clinic to trick vulnerable women into ending up there instead of the actual clinic. My wife was a nervous wreck the whole 3 hour drive there. Then she had to deal with that shit before we even got to the clinic, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s exactly part of their strategy. I can only imagine how much harder it would be for a woman who ended up there looking for an abortion and she was without support or a myriad of other situations which would be much more difficult than my wife\u2019s.",

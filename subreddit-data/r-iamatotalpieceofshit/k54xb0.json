Worst case scenario you can punish a prankster. Not much you can do to make up for what happened to the woman and her kids in this post.",

For some reason a lot of people seem to think it means the same thing as psychopathic. It really doesn't, at all. It doesn't really make people more dangerous necessarily, the main danger is to yourself if you have psychosis, it's why it results in a lot of suicide. But mentally ill people actually commit fewer violent crimes on average per person than mentally healthy people do, so I just want to dispel that myth. Like people say \"oh my god he's become psychotic\" in a film if the villain had become overly violent or something, when really that's not how it works. Here's some sources for that specifically:\n    \nhttps://www.time-to-change.org.uk/media-centre/responsible-reporting/violence-mental-health-problems\n    \nhttps://www.mentalhealth.gov/basics/mental-health-myths-facts\n    \nhttps://jech.bmj.com/content/70/3/223 \n    \nThe best way I can describe psychosis is that it's like you feel completely sane and lucid, but it's everything else, the whole world around you, that's gone crazy. You start seeing patterns everywhere that aren't there, like you start to put together little sentences everyone you know has said and you think there's some kinda pattern there and it means they're all conspiring against you or something, or you think you see a pattern of behaviour of strangers on the street that added up all together means they're all actors and you're in a Truman Show situation. Or you think that your neighbours are spying on you because you think you can hear them react to things you're looking at on your computer, or it seems like they're always in the toilet at the same time you are so they must be spying on you when you go to the toilet, that sort of thing. You think there's patterns there that aren't there. Really, you just ignore all the times when you *can't* hear them flushing the toilet when you're on the toilet, or only the times you think you can hear them reacting to stuff when you're on your computer and ignore all the times they don't. It's confirmation bias\n  \nOr really this is how it is for me, everyone else will experience psychosis in different ways. This is just the ways I experience it. For other people, psychosis might mean they believe they're jesus, or whatever.\n  \nBut yeah you think you're completely sane and it's everything else that's gone crazy. That's what makes it so hard to realise that you're becoming psychotic and act to stop it before it gets worse, like contacting your doctor and raising the dose of the anti-psychotics you're on for it. But the thing is when you're back to being yourself, like the meds have brought you back to being you instead of being that different person that you are when you're psychotic, it seems incredibly obvious that you were crazy. You can't believe you possibly could have thought those things. Even if it's like only a few weeks later. But yeah, the anti-psychotics I'm on now really work and have the least amount of side effects. It took over a decade of trial and error with different ones to find the best ones for me, but I'm very lucky and live in a country with universal healthcare, so I've never had to pay for them. And so it's just a matter of being in contact with your doctor and support worker/psychiactric nurse who can change things around with your meds very quickly, so if something isn't quite as good as you want, you just say OK and try the next thing\n  \nBut yeah the meds I'm on now make me be me, again. The person I am when I have psychosis, I don't even recognise.\n  \nAnd seemingly anything can trigger a psychotic episode. For me, not sleeping enough is the biggest trigger. But all drugs can cause psychosis, even caffeine, and alcohol. Nothing is entirely safe. But yeah the meds I'm on right now, Quetiapine, have the \"side effect\" of making me fall asleep. And so for the first time in my adult life I can actually sleep every night. I had full blown genuine insomnia, like staying awake for 4 days straight and not being able to sleep despite being exhausted, with the only thing working being getting black out drunk, which only really made things worse anyway. Drunk sleep is not real sleep. So this drug Quetiapine knocking me out means I have guaranteed sleep every night and it's fantastic. I'm me again.",

'Go on, Senua, you can do it. Yes. Yes.' - followed immediately by 'Give up, you're stupid. You can't save him.'\n\nThe main enemies come out of nowhere, forming out of darkness, and as you defeat them they just.. disappear.\n\nThe first time you die, one of your hands begins to rot and the game tells you that eventually the rot - the 'Darkness' will consume her, and your game will be over.\n\nI never did find out if you died enough that you would actually game over, but it seems like a white lie to place some pressure on the player and get them invested in keeping her alive.\n\nEventually there are patterns - and better than that, puzzles where you need to go to great lengths to climb to various random locations to align gaps in tree branches and such to form a circle around say, a doorknob. Which unlocks it, and then you can proceed.\n\nAs a game - it was very good and satisfying. But realizing that they intentionally based it all off a woman having a psychotic break and taking a second to step back and analyze it makes it somehow more terrifying. I'd imagine that, for some people with psychosis, 'needing to find a pattern to unlock the door' is something very real to them. Like they couldn't leave their own house until they did, even if the door was never locked.",

Some start to decline after a build up of stress or not taking medications. One aspect of a specific psychotic break from any other kind of mental breakdown is that psychotic episode are a period of disorganization or \u201cbreak from reality\u201d mode. This could mean visual or auditory hallucinations, it could mean paranoid or grandiose delusions, or it could mean racing thoughts and panic to the point of being unable to grasp what is happening around you.\n\nPeople who are experiencing a psychotic episode can present in many ways. They can be silent and exhibit Catatonia or mutism. They can speak in something we call a \u201cword salad\u201d and have many jumbled words and sentences that don\u2019t make sense, or they can be organized and present these issues in a seemingly rational way, but something about the context/content of what they are saying shows a break in reality\u2014like a 21 year old boy who was yelling in an ED that he was the secret weapon the government was hiding to destroy the Middle East.\n\n***I also want to take this time to express that people with psychotic disorders are rarely violent to others and are more likely a risk to themselves. Individuals with psychotic disorders are more likely to be victims of violent crimes than perpetrators. I only have seen violence in about 1/20 psychotic patients",

I grew up with a father with paranoid schizophrenia, and there were times where he was so.. out of touch that it was terrifying. He'd be yelling at me and my mom, practically frothing at the mouth.\n\nThere was one point as a teenager that he was having an episode and I got so scared that I shoved him to the ground and then ran away and got on my bike and just left. Sat in a park ten minutes away for hours, until my mom got him calmed down and came and got me.\n\nMy mom is a nurse who worked with people with mental health issues for decades. I think she realized that he wasn't violent, but psychosis is terrifying to be at the receiving end of. Especially when you aren't equipped to deal with it.",

Cases where psychotic episodes lead to violence are rare but morbidly fascinating. Also, it's easier to assume someone who has done evil things is just crazy than it is to accept that sane, rational people do very evil things all the time.\n\nEdit: I'm into true crime, and there is a lot of sensationalism that can happen when telling these stories. Google Mike Boudet if you need an example of the kind of mental health smearing that goes on in media, especially true crime.",

She explained that the father was unstable and she felt that the children were in danger. The 911 operator was rude and really slowly taking the information. You could tell the operator didn't care at all. Minutes later the father set off an explosion and burned the house to the ground , killing everyone inside. I think they are v supposed to take every call seriously but sometimes the just get jaded and don't care",

The next day an article came out citing 120 seconds. A grand jury just told the county they have to answer 911 calls. Oh, and very often, emergency calls are backlogged 100+ deep because of a lack of resources, meaning even if you have a true emergency, there could be 100 people in front of you in line, in my city. \n\n***Never*** trust 911 to help you. They might be able to help, but its better to know basic lifesaving (start the breathing, stop the bleeding, protect the wound, treat for shock). If emergency services eventually show up, that's great. If they take minutes just to answer when minutes count, its good to have basic skills to get someone breathing or beating. \n\nhttps://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/this-is-not-an-emergency-its-just-oakland-911/Content?oid=26892656\n\nhttps://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/06/24/oaklands-911-center-failings-put-people-at-risk-grand-jury-finds\n\nhttps://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/02/28/after-hundreds-of-911-calls-stacked-up-oakland-police-end-new-use-of-force-reporting-program/?fbclid=iwar0vhjzvrjryb5u-h5gycd3skvyr7tqf5or4pix29i8yxut5yzu2gn0tila",

I will always regret not standing up for the kid and telling him he was brave, did the right thing and didn\u2019t deserve to be screamed at by an adult for it... but I was too far away to really hear and switching back and forth between wondering if I was being an eavesdropper or what to do so that EMS was taking to the kid by the time I\u2019d processed what was going on. I\u2019d never seen someone have a seizure before.  I had no idea how dangerous they are.

My younger sister was 4 and had learned about 911 in preschool, so one afternoon she called and hung up a few times in a row. This was before locating stuff was used so the operater called back and my mom answered. They charged for a minute and my sister has to go to the station and apologize.  \n\n\nMy mom later told me that the next time they had preschool the Chief of police went to the preschool to reiterate to all these kids that you only call 911 in an emergency. Apparently between when they were taught about it and the Chief going to the school, just about every one of these kids called 911 and hung up.",

I've heard horror stories of dispatchers disconnecting phone lines because they \"weren't feeling it\" and it pisses me off. Even when I get a call from a troublemaker, I treat them with the same compassion and empathy I would anyone. Same with a kid, arguably even more so. You reassure them the whole time that calling was the right thing and that the cops are on their way to stop mom and dad from fighting, you stay on the phone with them so they don't feel alone and scared.\n\nAnd EVEN IF you think it's a prank call, don't hang up. Don't tell them to stop wasting your time. You get as much info as possible, and send help. I'd rather send help and find out it's a prank than ASSUME it's one and someone dies. After all, you know what they say about assuming things...",

Everyone was okay, no ambulance needed).\n\nSo when I called the cop station and asked them about being closed the officer was like \u201cwhat is she talking about, we\u2019re open 24/7...\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s nothing compared to the post and other comments here, but yeah... emergency operators, am I right?",

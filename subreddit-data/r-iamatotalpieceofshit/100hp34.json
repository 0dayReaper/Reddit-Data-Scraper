My first assumption is that this was made just to make a provocative picture. Either as a Halloween scare or a troll of some type.

Are we supposed to believe that somebody cut their hand severely on the machete and then just left it there for the next person, without reporting it to the police?",

I don\u2019t think it was a child that got cut because that would be a news report that probably everyone would\u2019ve heard about. If he did gash himself I bet he slipped walking down the steps and instinctively tried to catch himself on the railing that he just booby trapped which would\u2019ve resulted in a massive gash that would bleed like the pattern we see. That thought is so fucking hilarious.",

Eventually they all turned around and walked away real quick and one of the employees that was part of the crowd watching said they've been having a problem with people putting razor blades under the plastic handles, and this was apparently their method of stopping it.",

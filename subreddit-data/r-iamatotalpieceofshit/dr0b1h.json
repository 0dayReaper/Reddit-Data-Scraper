The kid pleads with the judge not to send him back with his mom and stepdad as they're abusive. So what does the judge do? Sends the kid back with his mom and stepdad.\n\nThere is another video of the kid in the court parking lot refusing to go with his mom and stepdad. Eventually a cop comes over, and the boy tells the cop that they abuse him. Even the cop is helpless. \n\nThe system is simply fucked.",

She got arrested for possession of heroin, the state took both my boys away from her. For two weeks they kept them until they found that her (very unstable) sister could take care of them temporarily. They awarded her the boys and she lived with my ex anyway. My ex lost all rights as a mother and dependent. The boys were then took in by her mother as legal guardian, who then in turn just left them with my ex and her sister. No one called me. No one notified me of anything. I have never done a single thing wrong in my life. I love those boys with every speck of my being and I was a damn good hard working father. There are no rights for fathers. I am but just one case for so many fathers that try so hard to be the best parents for our children, but the justice system is absolutely flawed and one sided when it comes to child custody.",

But it is more and more giving equal custody, at least when parents go through the system.   \nThe biggest issue is father's feeling like they'll lose in court so they voluntarily give up 50/50 custody in order to save on court costs.   \n\nIf he takes this to the court, in addition to the parental alienation he talks about, he could get more custody for sure.

My husband provided his son with clothing, food, school supplies, medical care and everything he needed while the mom just collected her check and on her custody weeks dumped the kid at her mom's.\n\nShe never bought her son a single thing. Meanwhile, she had a severe hoarding problem and basically lived in squalor. \n\nThis doesn't matter to cps either. Unless the mother is doing drugs and leaving needles around or straight up abusing the kid nothing can be done.\n\nThankfully we were are to give him some normalcy in his life so he didn't contract her level of crazy.",

Everything the account can and cannot purchase would have to be codified to prevent bias/discrepancies between auditors and ultimately it would push parents to not spend the money put of fear of losing their child to their ex spouse. \n\nChild support isn't fully intended to go to only the child, it is meant to boost the standard of living for the entire household to improve the child's living conditions. That can't be done if every bit of child support has to be itemized and justified to an emotionless entity.",

My father was supposed to pay similar amount on child support to cover myself and my two younger brothers - he never paid the full amount. And he only officially stopped paying it last year when my youngest brother dropped out of college, but he wasn\u2019t even paying it then.\n\nThe only contact I really had with my dad was in relation to my grandpa who was in his 80\u2019s with worsening Parkinson\u2019s/dementia. My dad had power of attorney but didn\u2019t take him to any of his hospital appointments.\n\nWhen my grandpa eventually passed, we weren\u2019t even invited to the funeral, and he had changed my grandpa\u2019s will and cut all of us out of it. A will that had been written when my grandpa was still mentally capable. Think the last time I made or had any sort of contact was 5yrs ago, whilst I was still in 6th year at high school.\n\nFrom all the stories that have been told in this thread alone, beit shitty father or shitty mother, the victims of the story are always the kids - and they\u2019re always harmed in one way or another (physical and/or mental).\n\nI hope you feel you\u2019re a better person now from it all.",

            "comment": "I feel this OP so much. I'm going through the EXACT same situation. Not only am I paying over $1000 a month in child support but I pay for most clothes, school trips and health/dental. The judicial system is more concerned about the bond between a mother and a child vs. overall quality of life.\n\nI could go into far more detail but everytime this goes to court, they assess that \"basic needs\" and met and ignore everything else.\n\nThis is Ontario, Canada for reference.\n\nEDIT: My daughter is 12 years old and this has been going on since she was 6 months old.",

The money is there to make the life style between the 2 homes more balanced.\n\nAt least in California the court awards 2 types of support: child support and spousal support. The latter is supposed to balance the households when one partner was the main bread winner. Child support is supposed to keep the childs lifestyle the same. Putting WIC style restrictions on child support sounds perfectly reasonable to me. \n\nI've worked as a paralegal in family law for a number of years and 95% of the time child support is used appropriately. If this father was my client I'd have a motion drafted with this picture as an exhibit and filed the very same day I was told about it. I'd rake Mom over the coals for shit like this.",

I gave them updated cross-streets when they asked but I never saw a police officer. I wasn't going to pull over and wait with a trauma patient and someone wildly chasing us.

Perhaps they are transporting a witness to a crime committed the the jerk driver. Like someone he assaulted or battered or tried to kill. Who knows?

Every time we turn our lights and sirens on (called code 4) it automatically files a report. It gets reviewed and there needs to be a good reason for going lights and sirens.\n\nThe closest we get to abusing lights and sirens is what we call \u201ccourtesy code 4s\u201d which is if a patient isn\u2019t emergent so we aren\u2019t using lights and sirens but they soil themselves and the attending medic in the back is on the verge of vomiting or the ambulance itself is on the verge of needing to be deep cleaned at base, so they need to get to the ED asap, or a medic is having bowel issues but there\u2019s a patient in the back so there\u2019s no way to stop at a restroom. If there\u2019s vomit or excrement in abundance in an ambulance then it needs to be taken out of service and sanitized at base, wasting thousands of taxpayer dollars and hours of medics\u2019 time and in turn leaving patients waiting longer when they call 911, so I think most can understand why that would call for lights and sirens. That\u2019s the closest to \u201cabuse\u201d we get.\n\nMany places have similar procedures for ambulances, fire trucks and police cruisers. So no, not all emergency vehicles abuse their lights and sirens.",

Burn units are the most common example of this, pretty much any hospital can take care of small, 2nd and 3rd degree burns, but burns that are either bad enough or big enough, you have to go to a hospital with a burn unit that can handle those injuries.\n\nSo then let's say the injured person is in city A - they either get their own transportation to hospital A, or get an ambulance. Upon arriving at the hospital, doctors discover they aren't equipped to deal with the severity of the injuries, and say \"This person needs to go to hospital B, that has this equipment.\" Then you have the scenario where a patient in critical condition is transported from one hospital to another.\n\nAlso, depending on the injury, you might need to go to the closest hospital just to get to a stable enough condition to be moved to the hospital that's farther away that can deal with the injury.",

The emotional abuse at the very least would be coming from a betrayal of trust but it\u2019s almost always paired with justification and blame. \n\nThe way I\u2019m taking it is you saying \u201cmy husband and his brothers were both physically and emotionally abused and of the 2 abuses, the emotional abuse persists through life.\u201d",

During one of the falls, another rider drove over him. The father's nerves failed, he couldn't hold back and thus splashed out his emotions. According to the parent, the child is okay and was not injured. She did not justify her husband's behavior and wrote it all off to her nerves, because her son could get injured himself and endangered other riders.",

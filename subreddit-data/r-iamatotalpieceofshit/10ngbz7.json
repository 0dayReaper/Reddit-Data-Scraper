She does not want to give you her details. That's why you should involve the police. That's why you should get her details.\n\nSo  you ask her for all her information.  If you're involved in a reportable road traffic collision (this is - damage to one vehicle by another) you have to exchange details by law. If she refuses (like she did right here) then she's committing a crime. \n\nAt this point, she either gives you all of her details (and check them against her ID) or has to backtrack and explain why she's totally not committing fraud. Hand her details to the cops anyway and have a great rest of your day. :)",

Or just misheard him/didn't process his implication. I doubt someone who was intentionally committing insurance fraud would just admit it on video. \n\nI'm leaning towards this being a mistake since she calmed down and started agreeing with the lads after they explained how it couldn't have scratched now. If people are truly scamming they tend to deny and get defensive, it doesn't seem to be the case. And if she was truly scamming she wouldn't have stood there and engaged with them, waiting for them to explain anything, she would have simply took her video and left. \n\nOr this is all fake.",

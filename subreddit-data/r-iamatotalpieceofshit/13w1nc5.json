The same people that went on for years about conforming to gender roles being an absolute evil are now using gender roles to convince themselves their kid wants to transition, instead of realizing kids are fickle and lack the cognitive capacity to make such a decision. Kids seek approval and attention, it needs to be given in healthy ways, not via pharmaceuticals and social media (looking at you Adderall) \n\nDad\u2019s losing their mind because their son likes to play with a kitchen set or nurture a doll are dolts, these are fine qualities in any person. Why our society doesn\u2019t see parents transitioning their children as dolts is beyond me.",

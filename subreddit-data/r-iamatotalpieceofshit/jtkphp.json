Was working with a patient that died after a car accident because she refused a transfusion because she was JW. She looked terrified saying it, but her husband was there exclaiming the sin of receiving a transfusion. She would have been fine, even though she was seriously injured, but she just lost too much blood. She had a toddler and a baby and died because of her religious belief. Seems extremely selfish to me, but thats my opinion.  \n\nThere are artificial blood products now specifically for this reason. Because it's fake, they can take the transfusion. But only if a hospital has it available. It's not super common and hard to get in a timely fashion. \n\nSource: am lab tech that does blood bank and work in a very small hospital that also gives me a lot of ER patient interaction.",

I also reluctantly remind myself that they are adults and we can only provide them with information.....it's up to them to make the decision....whether we agree or not. Some patients decline cancer treatments bc \"chemo does more harm than good\" but neglecting to understand that modern treatments aren't the same universally toxic substances as the older treatments....it's terrible and tragic for the kids.....but....it is the patient's decision......",

I\u2019ve also worked with JW nurses that explained their rationale, but they also have their legal shit together at all times in case of an emergency so that their wishes are fulfilled. Even they knew enough to kick the coercive family members out to educate their patients for proper consent. The translation ones are the worst though. So many patients would be without proper pain management if it were up to their spouses / mothers. One Russian guy kept moving his wife\u2019s call bell out of reach even. Fuck them.",

We suction up their blood as they proceed with the surgery and it gets filtered and put back into the patient. I've also been in situations where a JW has said to the doctor in front of their family members that they don't want blood, but as soon as they are away from their family members they let the doctor know that in fact they will have whatever will save their life.",

A little more information, you have to be baptized in order to be disfellowshipped. You can hang around and attend meetings, but the end game is to get you baptized so that total control can be established.\n\nWitnesses are \"nice\" people. My parents' congregation gets a lot of \"down on their luck\" types who just attend meetings to get free meals, rides, and even job hookups. My loser uncle who due to health issues can no longer smoke, drink or do drugs started attending meetings a few years ago, my mom fixes his truck, drives him to doctor appointments, took him to Victoria for medical treatment. He barely spoke to anyone in our family his whole life, but he knew where to come for handouts.\n\nThe handouts are meant to keep the person around so they can be talked into getting baptized. Most of these people end up taking off after getting all they can outside of getting baptized, but a few get sucked right in.\n\nA friend of mine stayed a JW for many years. His mom died when he was 13, and he was told over and over again that the only way for him to see her again was for him to stay in \"The Truth\", and that she would be resurrected one day. As he was a child, this was instilled deeply in him, and it took well into his adulthood to realize this was pure craziness. He was eventually disfellowshipped, now his father and two sisters will not speak to him or acknowledge his existence. They have quite literally walked by him on the street without making eye contact. I don't know how someone could do that to family.\n\nI was never baptized, so my parents still talk to me and we have an ok relationship. But that rift is always there, and I know my mom's greatest wish is that someday I'll see the light.",

She's identifying as a lesbian, though she can't tell those she's closest to. I can't push her away from it either, because unfortunately it's not my place to tell her, and she lives with her mom, so she can't easily leave if she wanted to.

I asked her what's to stop people from joining, and just immediately saying that they are chosen? She told me nothing, but people don't do that, cause that's wrong and frowned upon by the church. She also doesn't do well with explaining what it means to be JW  because she only pays half attention at the meetings, and forgot the other half of what she was taught xD",

I was kinda lucky as mum wasn\u2019t a JW. \n\nMy dad was pretty chill for an elder. I never really got any pressure to get baptised either. Was kinda like they thought it was a given but then I hit 16 and started going out and getting drunk and then I don\u2019t think dad minded that I stopped going to church as was always a wreck. \n\nIt\u2019s funny what you say about people being sucked in when they are down on their luck. I went to a JW bbq a few years ago and was bored as had nothing on common so started asked people what made them join. Every single one had some shitty life event. Cancer, car accident. Violent partner etc etc. then knock knock I have the answer for you.",

The 144k is the members of all God's chosen people, 12000 from each tribe of Israel, near the middle of the book of revelation. Now here is where I believe the JW got it wrong, the 144k, we SDAs believe, Is a symbolic number, not a literal number, the book of revelation is full of symbols. And if you pay attention and read on a little from the first mention of 144k, that is the number the author HEARD, but reading on a little he SEES multitudes of people, out numbering the sand on the beach( might be using the wrong metaphor but the point is solid)",

And that the law is getting too entangled with religion practices if they continue prosecuting the case? And one of the female judges agrees?!?? Like I read and understood that correctly right? I mean they worded it to be confusing and I'm no lawyer but what? Those are serious arguments? Our laws really shelter a church to abuse children?",

They use families against each other with their \"Disfellowshipping\" belief. Which is: If you don't follow the church's rule 100% to their liking, they will disfellowship you. You are cut off. From everything. Your friends and even your own family is told not to talk to, meet, or contact in any way shape or form, until they come crawling back to the church, begging to be let back in.\n\nParents willingly kick their own children out of their homes, if the Elders (Leaders of the church, ie Pastors, Priests, etc.) demand it.\n\nThey are not to associate with \"Worldly Influences\". Which means, no friends who are outside the church. No dating outside the church. No watching or reading ANY media not approved by the church. (Information Control and Suppression, another classic cult tactic.)\n\nThey do not want authorities to ever be involved with their religion. So any abuse, physical, sexual, mental etc. that is reported to the church, is \"dealt with\" in house, and even if serious crimes have been committed, they will not report them, for fear of bad publicity. \n\nThis is not a harmless religion with \"Silly beliefs\" such as simply not celebrating or recognizing any holiday including Birthdays. This is a cult, that has been manipulating and controlling their members for over 100 years now.\n\nSOURCE: Was raised in JW org, and left as soon as I was old enough to.",

Of course she had the only birthday that day, but JW don\u2019t celebrate birthdays, so the entire school sang to her. She looked so miserable and uncomfortable, but when she started crying at the end, I think it broke everyone in class. \n\nFuck Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\n\nEdit: we all knew in class she didn\u2019t celebrate her birthday, but the rest of the school didn\u2019t. So we just sat there in silence, looking at her, like kids do. The anguish is etched in my brain.",

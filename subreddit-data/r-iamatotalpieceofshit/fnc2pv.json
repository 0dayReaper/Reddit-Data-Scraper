There are some who dont think in scarcity at all! Like everything else, it certainly does not affect ALL people the same way, because that's not possible. Personally, I grew up in relative (not absolute) poverty and saw both sides. \n\nThere are some facts though. Poverty has a lot of factors that impact crime and scarcity is one of them (not the only one that would lead to someone committing a crime...others include mental illness, unemployment, higher police presence-- dont get me started on some of the asinine convicted crimes people in poorer areas get compared to more affluent areas,...etc. etc.). Its just a small piece of the giant fucked up pie.",

Yeast is also out, and that is very hard to find, but Yeast has a fairly short expiry time and what you make with it (bread) also spoils rather fast. So I have no clue why people hoard it... Also hand soap is out everywhere I've been, which is good I guess but why? Like we've always had a bottle of soap by every sink, don't everyone have that already? Why would you need a stockpile of it? It lasts months per bottle? It's so strange. Either people buy to have replacements ready for the next year or people didn't have soap home before (and that is a disgusting thought...)",

I thought he was helping him put the stuff in the car, turns out he was stealing. The man took the water and started power walking. \n\nI ran so fast and gave the dude a superman punch to the mouth. Ended up breaking his jaw. Never seen a man wall that loud in my life. My uncle was even shocked, he just quietly looked at the an saying, \"Jesus H. Christ\" \nCops were called people in the parking lot started shouting at me. Luckily some guy was recording the dude steal from my uncle. The cops took a look at the video and just ordered some EMTs to take him away. Didn't even say a word to me lol.\nI'm quite surprised the thief didn't press charges.",

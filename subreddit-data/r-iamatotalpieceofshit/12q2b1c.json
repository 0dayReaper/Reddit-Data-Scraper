They emotionally manipulate decent people who don't know enough to recognize when they're being conned. Basically the same tactic as an abuser.

Even if you don't know a whole lot in any given field (hiring an escort, buying drugs, hiring contractors, sending money to someone, etc.) the instinct of suspicion you get from being conned once makes it easier to avoid them broadly.",

I pointed out the address they'd send was from several apartments ago, but just imagine how terrifying for people who have stayed somewhere long term. I'm sure even scarier for them. \n\nIt's also so sad to think whoever the victim is in the photos now is revictimized every time those murder scene photos are reshared with scamming lies.",

In the US has a \u201ccash app\u201d service (which I\u2019ll be downvoted for) is the scammer bait and for less fortunate) as other services provide 1099s and in the US you pay taxes -depending on service\u2026but similar concept to PayPal and Zelle. \n\nCash App anyone can open an account and get a card, or two, or three, etc in different names and fraudulently scam people. STAY AWAY FROM CASH APP FOR THOSE THAT CARE ABOUT THEIR INFO AND BANK INFO. It\u2019s hard to delete an account that one fraudulently opens. Sorry\u2026I\u2019ve dealt with the fraud personally. \n\nWe also have a Venmo app we can exchange/pay others for services or donations.",

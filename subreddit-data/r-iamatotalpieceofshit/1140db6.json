You need room to grab a weight as a weapon and then room to swing it. This is an emergency situation where you are trying to escape, so the eyes and throat as well as groin are your best opportunities for escape.

Being blinded would be the least of his worries if he'd picked a different victim on the street perhaps.  Ladies, buy a small spring-assist pocket knife that you can clip onto the waistband of your workout shorts/pants and practice drawing it.  It's so small it won't be bulky during your jog or workout.  Smith and Wesson has a nice small one that springs open easily (almost like a switchblade).  I'm a female LEO who's been doing this for years.  Predators are looking for victims in exercise mode because they know you don't want things like guns or spray weighing your down.  Surprise them! (clearly, check your local ordinances to make sure you can have one)",

Long terms prison sentences in whatever other countries equivalent of Category A Prisons are yes 100%, total ostracism by a disgusted general prison population and some well deserved mistreatment is also a yes but until they manage to prevent anyone who is innocent from going to prison for a crime they didn\u2019t commit I think we should hold off on the permanent irreversible mutilation of sex organs. I understand this looks very clear cut but I\u2019ve seen video footage before that was terrible but there turned out to be extenuating circumstances. This guy maybe experiencing a psychotic break for all we know or is off his meds in which case he still very much 100% deserves to have his freedom withdrawn as he is a danger to the public but I think removing his testicles might be excessive. To be clear off I was there working out in that gym I\u2019d happily and unapologetically be beating him continuously until I felt that he\u2019d been neutralised as a threat. I hope most people would feel that if I then proceeded to pull out a knife and slice his testicles off then I\u2019d probably deserve to be locked up for evaluation too.",

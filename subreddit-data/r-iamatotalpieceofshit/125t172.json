It isn't acceptable, but it also isn't necessarily their fault, something they have control over, or something that they can't change now that it's being focused on. \n\nIf you treat a kid as someone who is suffering, suffocating, and lashing out as a result, they might have a positive future (see: Beth Thomas as the illustrative example). If you treat a kid as a psychopath, they will just become a \"better\", more effective psychopath (or, if they're not actually psychopathic, they will likely develop a host of other issues).",

It could just be a reaction to a diseased environment. In fact, this is what the literature would suggest... even psychopaths are only likely to come into contact with law enforcement or other institutional intervention if they suffered from an abusive, unhealthy, unsupported, unattached environment. And psychopathy is a real extreme, of course.\n\nObviously I get what you're saying, not disagreeing, just adding my two cents on that aspect of what you said.

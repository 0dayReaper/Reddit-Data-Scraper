That\u2019s the most fucked part about this whole situation. The government says you can\u2019t work then gives you a relatively small check (that millions didn\u2019t receive btw) and calls it a day. That is why this country is fucked. Because the government couldn\u2019t decide on an effective plan to combat this shit show in the early game. Instead they bickered, fought, and when the bee came out of the bottle they looked at the states and said \u201cy\u2019all got that\u201d. Now almost 200,000 people are dead in the US from Covid, due to the lack of a uniform plan, the populace saying fuck the rules, and the government leaving the people to their fates. All the president had to say was \u201cwear a mask, listen to the CDC and Fauci, were working on a vaccine. Do these few things and it will all blow over in a few months.\u201d But alas, he didn\u2019t.",

COVID positive dorm residents and their roommates are now waiting 36-48 hours to be moved into an isolation space, sharing the bathroom with 50+ people.

A church had set out a nativity scene infront by the road ,and everyday before school a young boy went and prayed there with baby Jesus well Christmas came and the next day baby Jesus was gone! The church looked everywhere for baby Jesus but they couldn't find him.  A day later the same boy that prayed everyday came walking up the road pulling a little red wagon behind him and in it was baby Jesus. The boy got to church and the preacher asked the boy \" have you seen our baby Jesus son?\". The boy answered back \" Yes sir he's right here! I told him if I got a red wagon for Christmas then I'd take him for a ride in it!\" The boy then got baby Jesus out of the wagon and walked back home.",

[before you try and disprove the bbt because its a \"theory\", a scientific theory is something that has been backed up with loads of evidence and can be disproved but most likely wont].",

Sometimes they act out in ways similar to how I did at that age, other times that take a step further. Sometimes they\u2019re willing to hurt others for no greater reason than just getting a laugh. Other times you see them threaten someones safety simply because the TV got shut off. I am genuinely scared for this new generation of up and coming adults. I know people say that youngest generation is always getting ragged on and to give them time. But the number of kids getting their needs met in dangerous ways is growing at such a high rate.",

The cameras aren't to protect the individuals, its to cover the organization's ass. So, even if the Teacher was to protect themselves it would fall back on the teacher. \"\n\nSome schools do train some teachers to do physical de-escalation. With things like \"handle with care\"  ir having a crisis team and some state laws give the teacher a degree of  defense, In case of imminent threat. The only issue is most schools don't teach a physical de-escalation techniques. That's something he csn probably go to his union about if it's a constant issue or threat of assault.",

While the teacher was writing on the board, we were tossing it back and forth across the class room. When it made its way back to the dude who brought it, he lightly tossed it at the teachers back. It hit the teacher and turned around and saw it, put the marker down and sat at his desk and assigned the class a huge homework assignment. The guy who threw it tried to take full responsibility and asked just for him to have the assignment but the teacher said no. That assignment was bigger than our final.",

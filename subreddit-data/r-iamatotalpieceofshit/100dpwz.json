It\u2019s actually safest if you fire straight up at a 90 degree angle, since the bullet has to come to a complete stop before turning around and falling back to earth. The bullet won\u2019t go any faster than terminal velocity in that case, which would hurt if it hit you but it likely wouldn\u2019t kill you. And certainly wouldn\u2019t kill you in your house\n\nIf you fire at an angle it\u2019s more like lobbing a bullet, and it doesn\u2019t have to lose its velocity from being fired before coming back down. When it does come back down The bullet wouldn\u2019t be going much slower than a bullet fired normally.",

I\u2019m all for gun ownership, but i\u2019m not for easy gun ownership. And yes i\u2019m aware places like marketplace have rules against selling guns, but I have personally witnessed friends trading for firearms and having zero paperwork past a bill of sale required.",

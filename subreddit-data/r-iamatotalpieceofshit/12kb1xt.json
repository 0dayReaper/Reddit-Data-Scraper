This may not be true, and I would like to be corrected if it isn't",

And in breakups, things get really, really nasty. So I 100% understand not being kind to the other parent - but hurting the child is so far beyond what I could contemplate. If anything, not playing nice with the other person is over fear of *losing* time with the child.

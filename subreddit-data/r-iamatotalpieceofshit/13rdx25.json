That's a 20 minute phone hold and a 4 hour police response time on average.\n\nPeople on Reddit think there are plenty of cops around to right every wrong and arrest people for breaking any law. That's just not reality unless you're in a rural area like a small town.",

There is a very low likelihood that this character will give his name and contact details after committing a crime, so unless he is restrained by the public, he is free to just walk away and disappear.\n\nIf the police don't get to the scene of the crime in situations like this, unfortunately the victim will have nothing to work with. And I doubt the police are going to do much with the photo of a random guy. maybe they'll half-heartedly check his face against a database of offenders...but unless its something serious like murder or assault, they'll probably tell the victim to pursue it with their insurance,.and maybe give them a case file number for reference.",

New thats a $3500-$4500 lens, Used its coming up around $2200-$2500. Repairs can cost between $1000-2000 or ore depending on where you can get in repaired, shipping, and the actual damage. \nNow if its a Canon EF 500mm f/4 L you care talking around $8000 -$8500 new and $4000 - $4200 used  but its likely the 600MM as that a much more common lens size and the photographer themselves say its 3000, which in US should be closer to $4000. \nEither way, if you add in the possible need to clean/repair the camera (Which is harder to judge, could be anything from the $500 Rebel series to the Canon 6D which is in the $2000- $4000 range, and of course may just need cleaning/repair veruses replacement depending on how wet the electronics get. OVERALL the guy is in for a costly 'mistake' (Quotes added because this was an intentional act so its hard to say mistake) \nSo overall, yea, could be anyhere from llike $1000 repair to $8000 dollar replacement.",

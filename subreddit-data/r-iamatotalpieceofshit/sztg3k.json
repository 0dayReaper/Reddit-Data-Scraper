I get it, but if it\u2019s literally all the same to me and no one\u2019s hurt, I ain\u2019t giving cops a go ahead to do anything on my behalf, even to douches.\n\nAnd some how I bet having the chance to return it and have the matter mostly dropped is about as effective as anything long term. It just doesn\u2019t satisfy some people eager for retribution.",

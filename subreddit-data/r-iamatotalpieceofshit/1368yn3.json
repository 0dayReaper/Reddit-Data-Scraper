I was there on a business trip and all the big bosses who drank had chauffeurs bc they didn't want to risk being caught and sent IMMEDIATELY to jail, even if they only fail a breathalyzer. Say what you will but that's how to do it, but so many places won't penalize this because lawmakers are also people who break this law.",

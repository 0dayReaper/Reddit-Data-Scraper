The amount of low quality posts, extremely graphic content, and just straight up disinformation with the intention of harming innocent folks is unreal.\n\nEvery new mod that has thought the way you have (because it's not an unfair idea to have so I wouldn't keep that from modding someone) that we brought in has rapidly changed their opinion after being here for a few weeks if they didn't just quit all together.",

I can understand the volume burns people out but it's hurtful for innocent folks to get called racist or whatever automatically by some bot and if they're decent folks they deserve some empathy.\n\nWhile we're very strict in the queue in order to quickly make our way thru and find dangerous content- like doxxing innocent people- in modmail I myself am empathetic and I push for our mods to be as well. Unless they're like an asshole or racist- then I mean.. whatever. Try to be professional at least.\n\nIt is a thing tho- especially on the ragebait subs. We don't get paid for this. It's not a fun sub to mod, I don't believe people when they say it is. What's important is identifying why a mod wants to mod here, and you just gotta look for the non-power trip reasons. For me I've got a big interest in social media. Other mods it's they like news/journalism. Some people like reducing the hate online. Others do it because they don't like power tripping mods themselves- that ones me as well. You know. You just gotta make sure the real reason to be here isn't going to negatively impact innocent folks.",

With section 230 protections the site is held liable always, but can aid in those protections if they generally moderate content, and if something is posted that could harm someone that the site has open and direct access to subpoenas as outlined in the privacy policy as well as Emergency Data Requests (EDR). \n\nThe repeal of section 230 means that the site will be liable for everything posted without discourse. All comments and user generated content will have to be moderated because being publicly posted there will be no reddit. There will be no discord, there will be no Facebook, there will be no pinterest, there will be no Instagram at least how we see it today with commenting. It would be far too costly to run.",

What comes to mind is the 'r/art' fiasco a short while back. That moderator was way out of line, and as we all know a lot of moderators all across this platform are trigger happy when deleting posts. If could, essentially, prevent content from being unfairly removed.\n\nI don't know though, maybe it just flew over my head XD",

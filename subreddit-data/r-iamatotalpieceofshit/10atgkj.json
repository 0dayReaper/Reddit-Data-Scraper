Also, depending on the rifle, state of charge, pellets/bbs used, etc, they can range from easily breaking skin to full body penetration. They may not be *firearms*, but they are *real* guns. All that to say I do agree, the type of person to have zero respect for an air rifle is the same type of person to have zero respect for a firearm.\n\nSource: Shot competition air riflery for years",

It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to detain all of them to determine who is responsible. None of them are being punished. \n\nYou strike me as the sort of person who would chance upon a man beating a woman and ask her what she did to deserve it. \n\nNo. The real criminals are in the classroom, I\u2019m not sure why you feel the problem here is the teacher. Your downvotes suggest you probably need to have a little think about the alignment of your own moral compass.",

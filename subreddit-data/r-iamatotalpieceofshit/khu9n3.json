If they use common sense and anyone finds out, then it 100% comes back to them.\n\nI work with VicPol youth engagement officers to deliver road safety talks to VCE groups. One of the questions the kids often come up with is: 'We're at a party out in the bush or on a farm. We drive a couple of kids who have been drinking home instead of leaving them with the temptation of driving themselves. Can we have more than one passenger in the car to do that?'\n\nThe cops pretty much have to tell them that yes, this is illegal, because the law has been designed around city teenagers and not kids who are in places with no public transport, taxis, or other options to get home. They also say that if they were the cop, they would let them go with a warning. But then if those kids had an accident a few kays down the road, it would 100% fall in their laps.\n\nedit to chill my inbox a bit:\n(1) this is Australia\n\n(2) not going to pretend that modern Victorian rozzers are squeaky clean but these are country cops I deal with and I'm 100% certain they have a lot more departmental accountability than many rural US police/sheriffs/gunslingers/whatever the fuck it is you have; they also have the eyes of the community firmly on them\n\n(3) Probationary drivers in Victoria can only have one 'peer' passenger at a time in the first 12 months of driving, it's complicated but then again Australian road deaths per capita are half of those in the US so rules like this save a lot of lives and serious injuries\n\n(4) Young drivers are much more likely to die on Australian roads, [here's a graph of every road death in Australia since 1989 sorted by age of the deceased](https://i.imgur.com/WFuUi8S.jpg)\n\n(5) I think cops should have a lot more leeway and off-the-record they do too, unfortunately they have inherited zero tolerance systems and this attitude is percolating up into the sentences that magistrates impose",

I've seen first hand how someone can pass out in the driver's seat at a red light so I get it if you're on the side of the road with the bitch running and you up front. But its pretty obvious whether you were trying to drive or not. But the pigs don't care about whats right. They're all evil scum that want to ruin as many lives as possible. So if you're doing the  mostly responsible thing because you overindulged well fuck you now your life is ruined.",

If you don't have a high enough performance in some of those areas then the force won't allow you to relocate after they send you to the middle of no where. I had a discussion with a mate who is a cop placed in a small rural area saying they didn't have quotas, but that he didn't have enough arrests to be allowed to transfer back home. Not because he wasn't doing his job, but because there literally wasn't enough crime in his area to make more arrests. So he's forced to stay there and refused a transfer back home until he improve that \"performance\". So this would obviously encourage dirty, untrustworthy and desperate tactics from cops just to gather enough fines/arrests in order to be allowed back home. It's the same shitty incentive schemes purposely used  just under a different definition.",

Hell one time when I got the cops called on my house party in highschool right after it had cleared out and  some random wasted middle aged dude almost plowed in to a parked cop car while I was talking to them. They asked me if he could park the car there. I said yes because I was trying not to get in trouble. They called his wife, had her pick him up, and left me with a warning about the party. Dude was so drunk he could have killed someone and they completely let him off. I kind of assume one of them knew him because I doubt he was sober enough to give his wife's phone number.",

A cop's wife was a notorious drunk driver and she would regularly get pulled and then get escorted home. Well then she cheated on and divorced said cop... for another cop. So like half the force was actively looking to give her a DUI while the other half was shielding her.\n\nI heard this from the woman herself and she said that because of the potential retaliation she was too afraid to go out drinking anymore.\n\nWhich I felt was poetic irony.",

For example: My city is ruled by the city police department, state troopers, county sheriffs, capital police and 2 university police departments all with different rules/regulations that they follow. If you want to get technical then we also have a military base with military police, US marshalls task force, local FBI office, ATF office, game wardens(the most powerful LEO in my state), state park police and port authority police. \n\nI'm also a 15 minute drive from 3 cities that all have their own police and sheriffs...with different rules and regulations.

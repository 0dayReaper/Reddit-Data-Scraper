An immigrant was getting deported, but in order to stay in the country he stabbed a mother and her child to death at an IKEA. A few years later I come across an article that describes the immigrants current situation. He is being moved from prison to prison because he has been beaten nearly to death by inmates who recognized him. Is currently sitting in isolation to avoid this but even now his \"neighbour\" at isolation has made it clear that if they meet outside isolation, there will be consequences. The immigrant hates being in prison in Sweden, and tried to get sympathy for his situation and wanted to sit the rest of his time in his home country. None were given. This made me smile.",

Is it better to be a free man in his country even though he may not have been as happy there as in Sweden or is he thinking that vegan prison in Sweden is better?\n\nWell I suppose prison in Sweden is better except for his particular case where he's getting beaten up so much\n\n\nYou probably thought he'll be a typical average inmate who is able to live without all this trouble in the prison house",

Not most abused become reactive abusers. it is high, but It's not most, not even close, actually most reference saying the majority strays away from that behavior.\n\nThere is evidence showing a small group of gays to have predatory behaviors. Cause im sure we all would have expected the pot to be perfectly clean,0 bad eggs s/ \n \nJust unrealistic expectations, bad people will always do bad things, and there will always be bad people. Its stupid, they even made a study on it like who would thought some bad people exist in a pool of thousands of people. Like how about we just start defining groups by the unacceptable behavior of the minority of people associated with it.",

Abusiveness is not something that's infectious and perpetuating this fucked up idea serves no purpose other than to stigmatize abuse victims and isolate from society, making it harder for their trauma to actually get treated.\n\nWhat actually makes an abuser is a complex set factors that is still poorly understood even to this day. But what we do know is that one of the leading causes of continued abuse is caused by how easy it is in modern day society to hide abuse. Sub-urbs and a car dependent infrastructure are a foundational aspect of this.\n\nOutside of that there's also the whole untreated trauma or mental illness thing. If it's treated then there's no real danger, the person will be able to live as normally as anyone else. So, again, trauma is only an issue if it goes undiagnosed and untreated. Which is more likely if you stigmatize abuse victims as a potential threat because they're more likely to not feel save about getting help. So you really need to stop perpetuating this harmful false narrative.",

I never said anything about defending them. \n\nI simply commented that I was surprised to see so many people insisting that they be put in prison (with a specific placement in gen pop, no less, so that the worst parts of the prison system are inflicted upon them) without a conviction.\n\nYou literally just said that \"they raped and pimped out CHILDREN\", and if they did, then that's terrible and they should go to prison (and probably a lot of therapy). At the time I commented, no source had been posted, so there was no evidence of a trial or conviction, just charges. \n\nI ask the following, not to imply that racism is present in the current conversation, but to illustrate a point. \n\nWhat if it had been a black couple? Or an indigenous couple? Or a disabled couple? Or an immigrant couple?\n\nWhy is it okay to condemn a gay couple (or anybody) to the worst parts of incarcerated life, without a trial or conviction?",

This definitely needed to be covered on big news outlets. The main problem is that the news outlets blow it out of proportion in a bad way spending less time actually arguing what a good sentence/punishment is for these demons and more time arguing whether we should still be supporting the LGBTQ which isn\u2019t a major issue in this case.\n\n4. Like I said before \u201cEvil people exist everywhere\u201d and it\u2019s hard to deal with some when they put on a good face on the outside. But on the contrary there\u2019s also a sum of people that actually need support. And yeah I really do think we should lend more support to more groups. But like you said who knows, hopefully we can see things like this and say \u201cthat\u2019s seems bad by itself and looks like the punishment seems awful too.

Firstly, MSN does not write the news that they report, they act as a middle man. New York post has written about them, they have been found to be only 44% reliable. \nThe other sources, daily wire, daily mail (tabloid), town hall, info wars, are all either notorious for being far-right/extremists and not always factual or tabloids, have reported this. \n\nI finally found the NY post that sourced directly from the Sheriff\u2019s office; however, the link was broken (probably since i don\u2019t have fb). \n\nI\u2019m not saying this didn\u2019t happen, I\u2019m merely asking for sources are are NOT biased and report the facts only. No speculations. These people have not been officially convicted. This is evidence by me directly going to the GA sex offender registry, looking up their information, and having no results. This means they\u2019ve not been CONVICTED. \n\nI\u2019ve, personally, already had someone I know reference this talking about how the \u201cLGBTQ+ pushes their way of life on people,\u201d and this is why I\u2019m terrified of this kind of thing being spread without ACTUAL-FACTUAL reporting. There are people, frankly idiots, who have the misconception that pedophilia is a part of LGBTQ+, and coming from a person who is not only a part of the LGBTQ+ community, but as a mental health professional, I can tell you with 100% certainty and fact that this is NOT true. Sexual assault of minors and human trafficking has nothing tho do with LGBTQ+ community, in fact there\u2019s been research that has shown more heterosexual, married, men have been found of pedophilia than gay men; however, some people don\u2019t want to believe that. They use information like this and they use it to blast their rhetoric of homophobia and ignorance. \n\nThese actions are absolutely horrendous and are the worst crimes against someone you can think of, which is why I want to ensure that this is 1000% factual evidence before I start throwing stones. I\u2019m not saying it didn\u2019t happen, but I want to see local news stations or legitimate news sources that don\u2019t merely take from other sources cite this.",

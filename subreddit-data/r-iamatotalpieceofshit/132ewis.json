Priests, teachers, drag queens, anyone can be an abuser, by screeching \"NOT A DRAG QUEEN\" you are harming victims of abuse by creating a space where they cannot speak out, since the assumption is if they do, people like you will attack them.",

Now tell me why you think kids should watch two people simulating raw dogging eacher on stage and how that doesn't make you the same as this disgusting pedophile?",

Bit me right on the face.\n\nThen it came up to me in the street and bit me when I was minding my own business. I had to beat it away from me with a toy boomerang I had. The people who owned the dog bandaged me up and I don't think I told my parents.\n\nThen it came to my house a few days later and chased me around the house. My parents saw that one and finally got the neighbors to take the dog far, far away. \n\nThe kids who owned the dog were mad I made them give it away... Not my damn fault!",

She mellowed out and got properly trained in less than a year to be a good dog. Went from I wouldn't even dare tucking her in (she'd snap her teeth at me, I understood the message, never messed with her blanket again) to I'd jump in the bathtub to help her bath.\n\nIn this last 2 years, we had to adopt a mini pincher due to life circumstances... Let me tell you, she is evil. Just so tiny she is unable to hurt anyone. But she is impossible to correct. It's almost like a cat, good luck training her.",

My mom's Indie is the sweetest and most loving dog in the world but people judge him just because he isn't a breed. Some have even threatened to hurt him.\n\nPeople like this woman should be ostracized from society and arrested. I don't agree with banning any dog breeds but frankly, most people in our country buy breeds as a status symbol.",

When it came to me barking and snarling I kicked it because it looked like it would bite me. The woman was furious and tried to keep me there to call the police for hitting her dog. Fortunately, there were people there that saw what she had let happen so they made her realize that she would get in trouble with the police. I thought of this memory when I saw this video.

If it really got him and he got hurt and then was scared he would pass by the second time he would've left the elevator for a moment let the women and dog leave and got back in to create space.

Another example of this that happened to me was on my way home from school one day when I was in like first or second grade some older kid decided to punch me, almost the same thing happened to me except I didn't get a bloody nose. Also what is the child supposed to do to stay on the elevator to get to their stop AND stay away from the dog? Do you expect children to be able to stick to the ceiling to avoid dogs? Children aren't Spider-Man, they can't just go on the ceiling to avoid threats.",

And the second he could've again stayed where he was till the door opened and then just left till the passed and either had time to stall the door and got on or had to wait till it came back up. \n\nThe first pass you know it's understandable not knowing the dog is aggressive but the second to pass her and get back in the line of sight if the dog and close enough to possibly get bit? That's a personal decision that could be avoided and is just pushing your luck. \n\nEven as a kid if something attacked me I knew to stay away from it over time I no longer cared because well over years I became such a massive person most things stay away from me and also it helps most animals love me more than their owners for no real reason.",

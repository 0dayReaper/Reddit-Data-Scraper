Without a downvote function, a lousy comment can be left completely without engagement at all, leaving the person to believe that either no one ever saw it, or that people did see it and had no opinion about it one way or the other. It's much better that they can know that their comment is trash.\n\nOn the other side, I can post a comment that I know will receive a lot of downvotes for being an inconvenient truth. By being careful to make sure I'm correct in what I'm saying, I can get a bunch of SILENT downvotes. Since these are downvotes that are not of the \"you're incorrect\" variety, but rather of the \"yeah that's true but you should just let it be and not say anything because it's inconvenient\" variety, I get a nice dopamine hit and a good laugh every time I see them start piling in.",

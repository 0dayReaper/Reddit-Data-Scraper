They are however forbidden to sell seeds from registered crops.   \nPepsiCo had a hired a private investigation company which basically performed a sting operation by purchasing potato samples from various suspected farmers and they are alleged to be PepsiCo's registered crop. The farmers however are not under contract by PepsiCo and have never bought seeds from PepsiCo. So someone sold quite a large number of seed potatoes of a registered crop, without permission. PepsiCo argues that the farmers obtained the seeds illegally and have therefore no right to keep propagating those potatoes.  \nAnd then somewhere down that line, someone in their legal department thought \"You know what, I really *could* use a second my swimming pool\"",

The two most notable cases are Bowman and Schmeiser.\nAnti-GMO activists (like Center for Food Safety) frequency misreport the facts of those cases.",

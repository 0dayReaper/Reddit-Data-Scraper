After asking the protesters to leave several times, university police pepper sprayed a group of student demonstrators as they were seated on a paved path in the campus quad. The video of UC Davis police officer Lt. John Pike pepper-spraying demonstrators spread around the world as a viral video and the photograph became an Internet meme.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/iamatotalpieceofshit/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Reasonable people can disagree about whether the protestors were fighting for a worthy cause (personally I thought they were wasting their time, having sat on the quad for a month convincing no one of anything) but there was no legitimate reason for the police behaviour.\n\nThey brought in backup from neighbouring cities, all dressed in full riot gear to face off a bunch of 20 year old hippies - hell there were almost as many cops as protestors. Moments before pepper spraying, Pike literally stepped over some of the protestors, proving the cops could leave if they wanted. Then he told the protestors they were going to get sprayed for blocking their exit. The justification was self defense, which was a patent lie.",

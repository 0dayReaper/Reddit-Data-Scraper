They also basically completely reroute a bunch of nerves in your face during surgery, sometimes unintentionally just because of the way our faces are structured. About three months after surgery, I had to get on a plane. I'd read that many other patients had issues with their ears when flying after this type of surgery.\n\nI've flown a billion times, but during takeoff that flight, I feel like I held my breath out of fear for what felt like an eternity. I was just waiting/expecting something to go wrong, or to hurt. Thankfully, no issues.",

During the first 6 weeks following surgery, I took weekly photos to document my progress. Before surgery, my face slanted kind of 'downwards' below my nose, and had a leftward slant. During surgery, surgeons corrected that. They brought my face forward by almost a whole inch, and also straightened it out, so that it didn't lean left anymore. \n\nYou know the Joker meme? Where he's wearing the purple suit and his cheeks are stitched up in red? That's kinda how my face looked, except you couldn't see the slashes across my cheeks, but the scarring on and along the sides of my face were pretty visible the first month or two. Imagine just cutting and sewing along the edges of someone's entire face, up both sides of the ears, up the hairline, and down the sides of my neck. Alternate visual: imagine using utensils to flatten a pancake onto your face, almost like a face mask, and then sewing it onto your face along the edges of your face. \ud83d\ude2c It was pretty gnarly! But healing has gone exceptionally well.",

I'm no stranger to hearing random kids cry when in public places, but this kid had a frequency of cry...it's hard to describe outside of it almost hurt to hear it, and it went on for about 10 minutes. It came down to me holding my hands over my ears near the end hoping it would stop.\n\nAnyone ever hear a kids cry that was on a brain destroying frequency?",

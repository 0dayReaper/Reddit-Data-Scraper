She was cast in musicals, performed with professional choirs and as a solo vocalist, and was (and, again, still is) a professor of music and vocal coach at one of the USA's largest universities.\n\nAmerican Idol's first round denied her because, and I quote, \"you have a fantastic voice, but you're too fat for TV.\"",

Say, if the athletes harm a fan on purpose( or say run out of bounds and fall on a fan but then when getting up they attack them further, for no reason(like their was no heckling, or instigating the player) then they can be sued and some have settled out of court for fear of loosing the case especially if criminal charges of battery or assault can be pursued by the fan. Kobe Bryant had to settle once for around 2.5 million when he was getting sued.",

            "comment": "so\u2026 with a minimal amount of online searching, this judge is named Dmytro Shurov. i really don\u2019t understand the amount of people calling this fake for a few reasons. first of all, because of this incident, the show\u2019s ratings dropped significantly. the x-factor never released a statement about the incident, leading me to believe it was the judge\u2019s own decision. secondly, the guitar was revealed to be a gift from the contestant\u2019s late father *after* it was smashed. if i were scripting this, i would attempt to make it as impactful as possible by alluding to the guitar\u2019s sentimentality before having the judge break it. thirdly, it\u2019s a globally recognized show with a lot to lose. the x-factor might indeed be scripted, but there\u2019s no proof behind it. after searching for any clue that it could be scripted, the only thing i could find is a rumour about the producers having auditions before the performer\u2019s first meeting with the judges, which allows them to pick performers that seem interesting, have talent, or are really bad for comic relief. \n\ni really don\u2019t care about the x factor and other shows like it. i despise watching them. but it hurts to see people disregard this contestant\u2019s situation as \u201cfake\u201d or \u201cscripted\u201d without any argument more than \u201cit just seems too fake, no one would actually do this\u201d.",

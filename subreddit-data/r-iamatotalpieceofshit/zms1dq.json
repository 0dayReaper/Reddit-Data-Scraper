This poor Woman does not know any of these gross males who are guilty of unwanted touch. She is a journalist doing her job. She has to worry about how far things could go during this mob scene. Many women have actually been raped after sports events because of this hooliganism. You share none of this fear while kissing your blokes.",

Calling this sexual assault is devaluing the meaning of the phrase",

It is still debated, because to be considered sexual in the French law, there needs to be a sexual intent, and kisses are also used in social situations.\n\nAlso, there is a word in France, \"baisers vol\u00e9s\" (lit. stolen kisses) which has a strong history, especially in poetry. \n\nSo yes, the kids are in the wrong, but it would very likely not be considered sexual harassment in France, and definitely not sexual aggression. Not saying I agree or disagree, just saying what the law is.",

Or did you just happen to miss the entire video. No matter what degree of sexual harassment, it's all actual sexual harassment, and it's all evil. This woman had multiple men make multiple advances on her sexually, yes even just a kiss, because it was clearly against her will.

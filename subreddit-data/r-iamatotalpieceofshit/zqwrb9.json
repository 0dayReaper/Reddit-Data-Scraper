If someone pops off at their peak there's no sliding down into the inevitable trough. We're left wondering and hoping for more. Look at Hendrix and his unbelievably short career. Another musical tragedy cut short with so much potential. So many great stars have gone the same way. But TL were special though.  Totally different music, but I'll never forget hearing about Ian Curtis committing sideways in1980. That was even more of a shock.",

Apologist is basically just a term for someone who forgives and defends a group or idea that\u2019s controversial or generally seen as a bad thing to support. So basically the same as supporter, just a bit more derogatory lol",

The term is heavily associated with religion, as many people have built careers and legacies defending a chosen faith to the public. Think St. Thomas Aquinas (older example) or Ken Ham (modern example). The term isn't limited to religion, it just shows up more often in that context. \n\nSo an apologist is a supporter, but not all supporters are apologists.",

Few conceive a general rule, but if an authority claims something people will adhere to it for their own interests.\n\nHume (empiricism philosopher) stated, 'reason is the slave of the passions', and broadly speaking I believe this. It is a sad truth most people find beliefs to fit their feelings, because few accept the relative nature of our reality. To believe your happiness, satisfaction and contentment are inherently 'good' is a very common and basic state of mind, and those who don't question the state of quo, tend not to question themselves, so this state of mind can be stretched to fit almost any belief depending on what the individual desires and where they might be. It is human nature, and what makes life worth living is despite this simple, sometimes bleak truth, great goodness and creativity has and always will spring into the world. Peace.",

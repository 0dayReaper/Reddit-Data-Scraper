One of them was them fight that the interstate going near the town. They one that battle now the interstate highway is about 45 min west of the town. The town it moved to was dying before the interstate. Now it is thriving town and has a lot of tourism. It is pretty cool to see how just a handful of people can either cause growth or cause a community to die. \n\nTheir reasoning was they didn\u2019t want poor intrastate travelers ruining their town. It the same reason I hear from people that don\u2019t want metro or public transportation to be extended further outside of Atlanta. They don\u2019t want to give poor people access to their communities.",

One day, a group of 2 guys and 1 girl approached us while me and him were just playing ball (we were maybe 13-15 at the time). They were trying to provoke us, and they managed to get to him. \n\nHe started fighting off one guy while I managed to hold off the other guy. My friend managed to knock the guy to the ground and hold him there, but then the girl started kicking my friend (much like in the video). My friend then proceeded to punch the girl in the face, making her nose bleed. She started crying and yelling at him at the same time, about how he shouldn't hit a girl and how her face is ruined etc. That day, that girl learned there are consequences to her actions",

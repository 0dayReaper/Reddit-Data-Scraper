Because of this, America has very few cultural beliefs/mannerisms that apply to a majority of the country.\n\nIn regards to this attitude about shoes in the house, it might be dependant on factors such as: rural, suburban, or urban spaces; the economic class of the individual/family (poor, working, middle, upper, whatever); the initial quality of the house; the type of jobs the adults have.\n\nIn my experience, my own family had a rule for taking off your shoes if you were going to be inside for awhile and were going to be anywhere in the house beyond the kitchen. If you are running in and out of the house often, just keep yours shoes on unless they are pretty muddy. Shoe rules were less enforced on guests (family friends). Another family my family was good friends with didn't seem to have any shoe rules, maybe because all their houses' floors were uncarpeted hardwood. Another family had some shoe rules that they were pretty lax with; as long as the shoes had little dirt on them that was dry to be easily picked up with a vacuum, you're fine.",

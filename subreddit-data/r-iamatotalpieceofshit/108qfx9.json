You should have taken your own advice b4 replied to my initial comment thecwaybu did.. \"  IT'S NOT THAT DEEP, ITS REDDIT\" \n\nEXACTLY!!  This is why your -- \" you take fake oxys\" comment was stupid and unnecessary! With that said--\nI'm totally fine. I can pick your obviously mentally unstable personality apart all morning... I'll str8 up, Dr. Phil your ass, Cuz I'm telling u, looking at ur reply history - ya got a problem there bud...or sis.. or non binary.. lol, I don't want to \" assume your gender..\" \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 Your repetitive reddit reply battles say a lot about you and your personality. From that, I can only imagine in my mind your poor existence.  Have a nice night, morning, day??? Whatever it is to you.. even though I picture a dark room with the blinds/curtains drawn to keep it as dark as possible. So u probably don't know morning from night... peace , love and happiness \n\nProfessor-- OUT!",

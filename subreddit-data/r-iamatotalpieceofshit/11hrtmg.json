I assume a landlord isn't allowed to discriminate based on that.\n\nThey were paid up, the landlord gave them the 2 weeks notice I assume their contract mandated.\n\nThe \"cause\" seems to have only been verbal and there's no suggestion there's proof of it, so the story would change if they pursued it to a more 'legitimate' reason.\n\nWhat would almost certainly get the landlord in trouble was the suggestion that they cut power to the property within the 2 weeks they had left though.\n\nPoor woman either way. :(",

All of these conversations sound verbal which would make them a he said/she said and the landlord would therefore win (as his innocence would be presumed).\n\nIt's worth adding that unless they do have some proof, they risk the landlord making his own claim for defamation, depending on how much 'damage' them talking to news can be shown to have caused. Unlikely though, just would be a risk if they pushed it and his lawyers might advocate for it.\n\nThe woman's dying, she likely wouldn't see any compensation either way.",

The issue is that: \n\n\"Your honour, I sympathise with the plight of my ex-tenants, but I gave them notice within the limits of their contract, I needed the property vacated for x reason, or because they failed to do y reason.\n\nAs for the power cut, I would have no reason to cut their power, the property was theirs for the remaining two weeks even if they moved out that day. I had no reason to harass them out faster. Power cuts happen, I'm only responsible if I fail to make reasonable steps to restore their power when notified.\"\n\nIs an entirely reasonable excuse and if the tenants didn't have proof the contrary, he would win by default. Not that it would even get that far, without proof I can't imagine a lawyer trying to take that to court.\n\n-----\n\nI will add, while I'm happy to assume the landlord is a POS, we really only have 1 side of the story and no proof has been presented to support their position.\n\nFor example, landlords have been known to cut power to get out tenants who refuse to leave/pay, but I don't know why he would cut the power a single time to a property that he can't move new tenants in until the lease duration is over even if he got them out that day. Even if he did indeed kick them out over Ambulances, I have more doubt that he cut their power a single time without their being more to the story.\n\nIt is possible, that while a dying lady and her partner is/has lost their tenancy and that sucks, it might not be for the reason we've been given by them and while we might hope a private landlord let her live out her days in his property, he's also not obligated to if he has some other legitimate reason to want them out.",

If from a moral standpoint, there's always a cause, even if it's ridiculous, so yes at all times.\n\nIf it's about the law then it depends what country you are in. Do that to a tenant anywhere in a european coutry and you're in jail in no time at worst, get a restraining order at best and in the latter case you won't get them out without a lengthy lawsuit. If you try it w/o notice.  It's still possible to evict somebody but never w/o notice. The US is way more laid back in that regard and it also depends what state you're in. Heck, some say that Mexico has better laws protecting tenants than some parts of the US. Though that's just rumors I've heard somewhere and I'd like to know if they're true.",

People who aren't professional or amateur athletes, people with no climbing or mountaineering experience. I'll amend my statement, and say that for *many* people in decent shape it just takes money (not skill,  logistical experience, personal resources, etc)\n\nedit:\n\nYeah, I'm not sure what this guy is on about. Cheetos? lol. I'm an AMGA certified rock climbing guide, and somewhat involved in the Alpinism community, hear and read stories all the time about the type of clients that regularly get brought up Everest. Some are not even in *decent* shape. With that said, he's right in that commercial outfits generally require some level of experience (being guided up Denali is typical), but those are things that people in decent shape can do. These outfits can get most people up. It's almost always the weather that prevents a successful summit.\n\nEverest has a high completion rate because it's heavily trafficked (which actually helps make a climbing route safer) and has less complexity in the popular south col route than other high peaks. Nobody is getting guided up Everest and turning around to join a private crew for Annapurna.",

I'm sure if we get a kick starter going for him it'd make more than 20 successful climbs with how little they get paid",

I reached out to the head of our department and they said they would ask the guy who\u2019s supposed to pay them and he did later that day.\n\nThen it happened again and I said this isn\u2019t cool and we need to get this figured out. (This instance he paid them in cash) They said it\u2019s not their responsibility to pay them since they pay the owner. Well during all this I found out we paid them less than a dollar an hour (same position back in California was $15) and again they said it\u2019s not up to them what they are paid.\n\nI gave them an ultimatum which was pay them a better guaranteed wage or I walk. Unfortunately I trained them well enough to essentially be self sustaining so they said ok leave.\n\nWell as I was packing and getting ready to leave my apartment and head home, found out the last months hadn\u2019t been paid by my company either lol.",

They not only climbed the same mountain, but they were carrying a ton of stuff at the same time. They\u2019re amazing. Even with the Sherpas though, many of the climbers didn\u2019t make it for various reasons. Cardiovascular fitness is crucial, in addition to the physical strength needed. The atmosphere is really thin higher up and not everyone makes it. Yeah, you have to have a lot of money, but physically you need to be ready too.",

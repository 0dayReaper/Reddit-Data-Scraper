My guess is all his life around the people he is comfortable with hurting people is entertainment and shows you are tough so it is normal to do.\n\nSo he goes to the park and picks out someone he sees who he perceives is weaker and fucks with them. He immediately feels better knowing that he has power over someone and for him it has the added bonus of being funny for the people he is with making him feel more socially accepted.\n\nBut once people start circling around him and filming he knows he fucked up. What's he gonna do, start swinging? He starts to get uncomfortable and picking at his shorts near the end and his demeanor changes- almost looks like a child would, because that is essentially what he is - someone with the mind of a child.",

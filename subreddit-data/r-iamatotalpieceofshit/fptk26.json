Everyone is going to say that of course they won't but you never know, they may be quieter with everyone staying at home and be more willing to assist given your situation although you'd have to get very lucky. \n\nGetting up at 6am and just waiting for them to show up could also be an option. When the delivery comes just bring it inside but leave a dummy box or something instead and watch to see who comes to take it. If you see them coming through the window and they don't look like the sort of person you want to confront you could take some pictures and video with your phone and turn that over to police, if you've already made a prior report then it may hold more weight. They live local for sure, you may even recognize them. If you get a photo you could post it on a local app like Nextdoor and see if anyone can ID them for you.",

Competition is what causes the aggression, whether it's Pok\u00e9mon cards or COD. Violent non-competitives games like Silent Hill or Devil May Cry don't make people more aggressive but online multiplayer stuff does play a part.\n\nIt's why sports events can be just a boiling pot of rage because people treat it as not just a competition between the players but with the fans too.",

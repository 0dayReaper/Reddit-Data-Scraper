They'll pretty much use anything if they think you'll take it personal enough to get a reaction out of. R-pe is a sensitive topic, so ignoring can be difficult, but once you understand how pathetic it looks on their part, you've pretty much eliminated most if not all trolls in general. I've seen people have entire hissy fits because I wouldn't acknowledge them and their sad little games, pretty funny to be honest.",

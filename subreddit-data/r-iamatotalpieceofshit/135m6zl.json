Yes racist people are out there speaking as a black person but that doesn\u2019t mean the law is terrible because racists use it, but instead gives people the power to show any criminal that they can\u2019t go around committing violent crimes without picking the wrong house and getting stopped.

That response was really misguided since it was based on one comment on Reddit and you started to state what you think I mean which cannot possibly be farther from what I believe in any way.    What I meant by holding them was as in keeping them there until the police arrive *which is legal in certain states* also never said you could shot anyone for anything, I said for violent crimes or where the criminal acts aggressively which won\u2019t normally get you charged. And for the YouTube videos, there are actual people who know more than you on these types of situations (lawyers, police, ect) who tell you how to properly defuse the situation without shooting ideally. Just because you don\u2019t agree with them doesn\u2019t mean you can completely discredit them without even watching their video *THATS woefully ignorant of you* (you can downvote me but I will stand with my belief as long as it is legal and moral)",

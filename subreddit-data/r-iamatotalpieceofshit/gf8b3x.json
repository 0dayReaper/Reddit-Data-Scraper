I hope they burn in hell.\n\nI was a first responder in Brunswick GA and lived there for 5 years, I am white and can say those fucks down there are the most racist inbred hicks I've ever encountered. Granted there is a lot of gang crime as well, but the \"country boys\" down there are the worst kind of redneck. And the city is eating itself alive and turning more into a slum every year.\n\nEdit: oh yea and the commissioners and cops are all corrupt as shit, there's been multiple \"suicides\" that were clearly murder and everyone turns a blind eye, there were a few good apples in the bunch, but not many.",

The only problem is that, according to Georgia law, you can only perform a citizen\u2019s arrest if you catch someone in the commission of a crime.

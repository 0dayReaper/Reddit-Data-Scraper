If the FDA were to completely not allow rat feces in food a factory could get shut down just by finding one small rat turd. Definitely gross, but at the time probably not worth shutting down a whole food factory during a time when people didn't get much to eat. Jump forward to today and it likely isn't a large enough issue for the FDA to really care about it. When was the last time you heard about rat turds in food? I personally can't remember a single time.\n\nAs I said, this is only a guess. I have not done any actual research into it, so I could very well be wrong.",

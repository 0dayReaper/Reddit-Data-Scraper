                    "comment": "Yup, not to mention they have a very strict hierarchy. Adults eat before youngsters, mothers before their respective children. Dominant males get first pick of food \u2026 then the alpha female and her immediate family \u2026 then the next female and *her* family, and so on, down to the lowest ranking female and her offspring. So when troops gather to eat(or be fed) there will usually be big, healthy, and aggressive monkeys chowing down beside the food, with sadder, scrawnier monkeys waiting on the sidelines looking like Oliver Twist.\n\nHumans see these poor mistreated waifs and it offends our naive sense of fairness and kindness. So a lot of the time we single out the shyest, smallest monkeys and try to personally hand them food. We want to make sure they get at least a crumb, right? So we shoo away the other monkeys and deliver a coveted treat directly to the underdog. The shy monkey can\u2019t resist, because it\u2019s a monkey, and grabs the food.\n\nUnfortunately, monkeys have their own sense of \u201cfairness\u201d, but it involves mob justice for the slightest transgressions. Skipping the line for food is a big transgression. So the shy monkey usually gets their ass beat.",

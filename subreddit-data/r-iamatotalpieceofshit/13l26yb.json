You can't be so dense not to know that we now KNOW about things like this more often. If it were 1985 right now...you wouldn't know this happened because no one would have a fucking cell phone to upload the video online AND you wouldn't be able to read the news paper online from a town in a literal other country (presuming you're in the U.S.)\n\nIf we must be young...you must be old and losing brain cells.\n\nThink about it for one microsecond lmao. You have access to knowledge you never had in decades before social media. If you can't put two and two together no one can save you.\n\nYour personal feelings don't dictate reality.",

Plus, having powers that be eg. past Presidents acting like \"idjits,\" putting it mildly, gives the \" little people \" te impression that the behaviors are acceptable for anyone.\n\nKeep in mind this is just my take on society and in a nutshell no pun intended.

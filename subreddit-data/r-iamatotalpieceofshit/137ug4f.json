Let\u2019s do this.\n\nEvery human being on the face of this planet has made mistakes or done things they are not proud of. Every single one to varying degrees. So where do we draw the line on how should be continuously punished and who should be forgiven? In my opinion comment sense would say those who didn\u2019t do things that caused harm to others would likely be able to be forgiven. Now, what these people are doing is very stupid it is not causing harm to anyone or anything.\n\nCurrently the people in the video are children. Late teenagers at best maybe young adults. Are we really going to start saying that people with underdeveloped brains should suffer for the rest of their lives for something so minor? That\u2019s interesting I wonder if you have the same feelings towards kids who make prank phone calls. \n\nYou are the last person to talk about anyone else being pretentious while you\u2019re sitting here on your high horse judging kids as if they should be punished for life for something so petty.\n\nHave the day you fucking deserve Karen.",

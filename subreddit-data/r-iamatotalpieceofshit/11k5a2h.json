Then they tie their finances together, take the victim's wages or refuse to let them work, and possibly have children with them. Those kids will keep the victim coming back, or make it harder to physically leave with the kids (shelters for families are harder to find than shelters for individuals), or the abuser will threaten that they'll never see their kids again if they leave.",

Sadly it\u2019s almost until someone dies, or until someone removes them from these situations. My sister was in a serious abusive relationship with soldier who loved to tell her how he could kill her and how no one would ever find her (I didn\u2019t know about this until after the fact). My sister didn\u2019t see us much, but after about ten years he let my sister hop on a plane and visit our family, she didn\u2019t mention anything during the whole trip, which was about 2 weeks. She had her toddler, a suitcase and that\u2019s it. While going to the airport to go back, she had a nervous breakdown, broke down and said if I go back he will kill me and take my children. Needless to say, our family didn\u2019t let her go back. Her vehicle, everything she owned was left behind, but most importantly her child and she is alive. Without a doubt, if my sister had gone back, he would of eventually killed her. She  went through years of therapy, couldn\u2019t even drive for a long time. \n\nIf you are in an abusive relationship, it\u2019s not your fault. You can\u2019t change them, nor is it your responsibility to. LEAVE! Tell a loved one.",

Take what you absolutely need and leave, even if it means you have to pack light. Don't talk to anyone they know, delete all numbers and remove/block them on social media, etc. Just cut all ties. Find people you feel physically safe around who can emotionally support you, and rebuild your life.",

Attacking someone on the street will be treated far less severely than attacking and battering a domestic partner. In my state, people who only get into a verbal argument with a domestic partner can be sent to prison because of prior domestic violence conviction-modifiers (which, obviously, they earned). \n\nIn other words, much like tougher OWI or drug laws, there are just some types of behavior that can't be punished away. This kind of behavior is sick and not easily deterred by tougher penalties.",

In that sense, you could be a quadriplegic and still abuse your SO.\n\nReal solutions provide support to victims and educate the public about the dangers of abuse.     \nAny \"women/men are inherently evil\" rhetoric is not needed or wanted here.",

Bigger nations had been funding large standing professional armies for quite some time while our new nation hadn't. We also lacked the resources and taxes to build a comprable standing force. Instead, we devised a militia system; We would allow the common man to have firearms so we could call upon them in times of need. Precursor to our national guard in a sense.",

If you look closely, there's a welcome mat outside of the door seen in the video, and the video itself is taken from a doorbell camera. Seems to me like it's an apartment complex, and she quickly ran out the door when the abuse started happening. The staircase to the left probably leads to the second floor apartments. You can even see at one point she walks directly next to the camera, probably intentionally to make sure the doorbell camera got triggered so she could get evidence to use against him.\n\nNow if there was a situation where someone broke into someone's house to help them, I'm not sure what exactly would happen. I'm not a legal expert and the law also varies state-to-state, and by country. But I'd imagine it would be a similar case to if you visit a neighbor and see them unconscious on the floor through the window you would be protected atleast somewhat to break in the window to check on them. It just depends on the individual scenario as generally the law doesn't account for every possible circumstance. I'd imagine if you did break in to stop domestic violence and ended up shooting the perpetrator, you would be somewhat protected, and critically the amount of force used would be compared to the severity of the situation. Did the perpetrator have a weapon? Did they intend to seriously harm or end the life of the person being attacked? Could you have called the police in time? That's the kind of questions they would probably ask in court.",

Smoking kills far more, and people do it despite knowing it's killing them. Their families can only watch them die.\n\nWant to save lives? Jail every smoker. Imprison everyone who speeds, traffic deaths are also much higher. Jail everyone who leaves a dangerous dog unchained. Jail everyone who doesn't recycle.\n\nIs that the world we want to live in?",

It's like they want me dead. They are causing me to live in constant fear, so a monster who tortures people doesn't have his gun rights infringed on. So I'm a sacrifice, basically.

All the basic ass background does is check if you have a felony. It doesn't do anything else. You then fill out a questionnaire that asks if you're a bad boy which you can really easily answer \"no\" to. \n\nYou do not need to go through training to buy a gun. You do not need a license to buy a gun. Unless someone tips you off you don't need to store it safely either because of a lack of safety checks.\n\nYou can easily go buy a handgun from anywhere you want and so long as you're not an actual criminal you can get it. You don't need to pass a mental health examination, go through training for a license, nothing. Don't be a criminal and lie on a questionnaire and then pay.",

There are so many people who stay with their abusive partners until it ends up killing them. I\u2019ve heard so many cases of people saying \u201cif something happens to me, it\u2019s him\u201d or \u201che\u2019s making me scared for my life\u201d\u2026 and then next thing you know, they\u2019re dead the next week. Like\u2026 how could a man, an ABUSIVE man at that, mean more to you than your own life??? If you see death coming for you\u2026 why do you wait for it to happen??? Just do something, ANYTHING, to try and change the path you\u2019re heading down... And it\u2019s not like heroine or something where taking it makes you feel euphoric, so you end up craving that feeling so much to the point where you take too much of it and overdose\u2026 This \u201cboyfriend\u201d makes you feel like the worst you\u2019ve ever felt in your life, it\u2019s nothing but pain\u2026 What\u2019s so addictive about that??? What keeps pulling you back in??? I\u2019ve never been deeply in love before, so maybe that\u2019s why I don\u2019t get it, but god I just wish I could open these people\u2019s eyes and help them see clearly instead of watching some monster slowly lead them to their own grave while they don\u2019t even put up a fight\u2026",

I finally understood the reality of these situations. It took multiple attempts to successfully leave the relationship, and believe me I was fighting to save myself every single day of my life during that period even if it didn\u2019t look like it to outsiders.\n\nSurvivors intensely wish society could \u201copen their eyes\u201d too. You always think you are smarter, quicker, less susceptible to mental manipulation than others UNTIL you become a victim yourself. It humbles you so fast and it will make you regret ever having harshly judged others in the past.\n\nAbusers usually don\u2019t start off by beating you into a pulp. They build your tolerance for abuse by inoculating you with barely noticeable micro aggressions and slowly build the intensity up as you get immune to it. Same tactic is used for every other aspect of your life they want to control. They are also very good at putting up a front. Explosive and obvious abuse is actually the outlier. Most abuse is stealthy and behind closed doors which makes getting help a lot harder.\n\nThe trope of upstanding, respected member of society who unexpectedly gets arrested for abuse because someone *finally* managed to get evidence after years of suffering is very real.\n\nThat said, I understand that no matter how much I try to explain, you will refuse to believe me cause you simply can\u2019t fathom how it could be possible. Cause again, I was the same way. The stigma and misunderstanding is on par with depression and panic attacks. No amount of words, no matter how eloquent, will be convincing enough if you don\u2019t have first hand experience.",

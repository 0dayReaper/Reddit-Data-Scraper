On top of that the money came from savings gained by cutting costs on maintenance, crew size, and safety equipment. Money which they had claimed they were going to put towards other better safety improvements. \n\nThere could not be a more evil set of circumstances for them to have created this situation with unless the money came from shutting down a children's hospital that specializes in treating orphans with cancer.",

They have gone and put in fire extinguishers because they know that fire extinguishers should have been there and would have prevented the accident.\n\nThe most they can do is just show that fire extinguishers were not there. Then they have to show that they reasonably should have been. The mere fact that they have gone and put them in since the incident, cannot be used to prove that they should have known to have them there in the first place.\n\nIt's weird, but the purpose is to encourage manufacturers and businesses to make necessary safety changes without fear that merely making the change will make them liable in court.",

Are you going to load them on a lowboy semi-trailer and move them out of town? Probably not.\nAnd why did the train derail in the first place? I've heard too many stories about saboteurs in this country... shooting up electric substations, pulling spikes and rails from RR ties, even cross-circuiting RR shunts and activating the wyes after the locomotives go by, causing the cars to move over to another track.  SICK people out there.\n(BTW, I live about 55 miles east of E. Palestine.)",

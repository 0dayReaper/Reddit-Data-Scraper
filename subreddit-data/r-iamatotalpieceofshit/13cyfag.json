    "postText": "OC- A couple years back while I was an Assistant Manager at Giant, this man walked straight out of the store without paying. The Meat and Seafood departments kept getting hit hard by theft and several bad inventories. In our area sometimes there's a ring of thieves hitting stores. I gave in and instead of doing what you're supposed to do (by store policy) I followed him out, took the cart, and snatched a few items back out of the trunk. We called the police/asset protection afterwards and did the usual theft process. We ended up \"getting back\" almost $500 (for documentation because you can't sell perishible items after they leave the building). \n\nMy apologies for the poor quality and bad angles \n\nTl:dr; man tries to steal cart full of meat/seafood and gets confronted \n\n",

At the operating unit levels individual managers are bonused based on controlling shrink. The adage in retail has long been \"The best way to prevent shoplifting is excellent customer service\". Walgreens, cited here by many others, reported big declines in shrink in their most recent quarters. This despite their CEO bitterly complaining most of last year that they would be forced to close stores due to \"shoplifting epidemic\".\n\nPolice stats are a bit unreliable, owing to how the criminal statutes are defined. Shoplifting as a criminal offense is partly defined by a dollar value in states. Like so many other things, those values in some states have not kept up with inflation. So that a statue most recently revised in the 1980s sets the upper limit for the misdemeanor charge at a comparatively low level after four decades of retail inflation. Prosecutors and police prefer it this way and exert considerable political pressure and lobbying effort to keep it so, since these artificially low requirements for charging a felony provide useful leverage in obtaining guilty pleas and allow them some leeway to juice their own stats at budget time or reelection time.",

Costs increase because they can, because wide-scale chain supermarkets know for a fact that they can get away with it. \n\nWay to try and paint the most tragic picture possible, though. Maybe next time these thieves will start stealing the actual babies and cut out the middle man. He's stealing food, dawg. No one cares, and it absolutely does not matter. \n\nStealing from a PERSON is wrong. Walmart is not going to reward you for defending their honor.",

All because some a-hole decided to stick it to the corporation and take things without paying.\n\nYou make stealing sound so noble when it\u2019s against a company you hate. It\u2019s still stealing.

They were all keenly aware of it, and that's why they raised the animals well so they were only the best of the best. The people who bid on said animals know this, and they're almost always either butchers or restaurants that are looking for top quality proteins and will do full nose to tail processing of the animal to ensure not an ounce is wasted. They also want to support such an important club, and generally pay over what their animals are really worth, ensuring 4H remains viable and can continue teaching kids where their food comes from. \n\nThe fair did nothing wrong, it was 100% a failure of communication somewhere by the girl's parents who didn't know or didn't care to know what was going to happen, and then didn't tell her. That's sad, but doesn't justify trying to steal back what is now rightfully someone else's. And these kinds of awful articles that are blatantly misrepresenting things just for clicks are hurting the reputation of a venerated and important club for kids.\n\nEdit since you either deleted the comment or it got auto-deleted, I don't make excuses for anyone, the mother shouldn't have stolen the goat and she should've made it perfectly clear what was going to happen to the goat when it was sold. Everything that happened after that wouldn't have happened if she hadn't stolen the goat, and all that would be left would be a sad little girl instead of a traumatized one.",

The article covered that after the sale the young girl crawled into the stall and cried for hours with her goat and her mother decided she could not 1) have her daughter raise an animal to slaughter when she did not want to, and 2) spoke to the 4h people to buy back the goat.  When the officials refused to sell the goat back to her, she decided to take the goat and work out the civil suit later.  The 4h officials decided this was not okay and that part of 4h is learning all aspects of farming including the sale and slaughter of the animal so the sent the police.  The police obtained a warrant with language similar to a drug raid and they raided the family\u2019s home including full door breach and tearing apart the home.  They found where the animal was taken and killed it even though the state senator had promised to put the goat in a sanctuary because 4h expected a slaughtered animal. \n\nNow the 4h officials are upset because of the social media rage that sent the story viral and are fearing for their lives.

According to law, the police either had to keep the goat, or hand it over to the courts to determine who owned it. Instead, they gave it to a third party for slaughter, against the law.\n\nSo the lesson to be learned here is that police do whatever they want, regardless of what they are told and what the law is.

They saw the bad social media publicity, called the police, and the police drove who knows how long to search for the goat, then took it back to have it slaughtered. \n\nIt was excessive and a waste of resources. If the child wanted to back out, she could have. If animals are considered property, this was a civil case between two contract holders that should have been handled in civil court, with the monetary value of the goat paid to the owner. \n\nThat's what should have happened. The asshats at the fairgrounds bypassed all that, by calling cops who were just as bad to take the goat back and slaughter it. \n\nThey did it to teach a lesson, it wasn't about the property. \n\nThe family is already talking to lawyers to go after the Fairground for violating civil process and wasting police resources.",

The mom even offered to pay for the goat plus the 7% commission for 4H, and the Sasha county fair officials refused; and then went to a judge and had them sign a search warrant usually reserved for drug traffickers, to bring the goat back.\n\nAfter they got the goat back they were supposed to hold it until the legal case of who owned the goat could go through the legal process, but instead 4H handed the goat over to an unknown third party and it was butchered.",

The goat was bought and paid for, well at those prices it's more of a donation to the organization, but still. \n\nThe girl wanted to back out of a contract, which by California law is allowed because she's a kid. The problem here is her parents getting her a goat that is to be sold for meat as a pet when she was that vulnerable, after reading their sob story. \n\nThe buyer being a politician didn't care everything goes through like normal he helped the ag community, things go with goat living on a farm, he saved a girl's pet it's a pr dream for him. I'd assume he never even took possession just gave them money and said use the meat however you can. But now he's in a hard place because does he side with the poor little girl that lost her friend, or the ag community that reclaimed stolen property?\n\nFairgrounds and 4H are dealing with someone stealing almost $1000 in goat then running away. You have to report that, sheriff's department doesn't know what the hell is going on just \"this family took a felony amount of livestock and ran, the owner wants it back.\" The butchering immediately after I'm assuming is in the contract or some other stuff, but damn that was another bad move on their part.\n\nI'm assuming a few people are going to resign over this, but I hope people learn not to keep livestock as pets, it's too hard to say goodbye. Get your kid a cat or a dog or something, not an animal that is contractually going to be used for meat. Barring that, talk to the fairgrounds, they know they are dealing with children they will almost always react better to asking ahead of time instead of having to deal with theft, there isn't some evil guy in charge of it rubbing his hands wanting to murder your goats",

Second, the family offered full compensation for the animal. \n\nLet's replace the goat with another piece of property. Say I buy a TV on craigslist or ebay from some dude in town and send him the money via paypal. I agree to pick up the TV tomorrow but a few hours later the seller has a change of heart and refunds my money. \n\nAm I going to press charges? JFC of course not. Would charges stick? After all, I bought and paid for the TV, it was *my* property. First, I highly doubt that charges would stick in criminal court because I suffered no financial loss. Second, the average DA would probably laugh at pursuing such a case.\n\nSimple contract violations like this are almost always a civil matter, not criminal.",

            "comment": "People are leaving out the part where the family SOLD the goat to the fairgrounds for almost 1000 bucks knowing full well that the animal was being auctioned for meat.  Like they knew 1000%.  But now they want to talk about how the daughter was emotionally attached to the goat.  Did the police waste money and resources, obviously, this is about the only thing the government does efficiently.  Do I agree with selling and eating the goat.  No.  I have 6 pet goats right now and half are rescues.  But don't fucking sell your goat for meat at an auction that get a surprised Pikachu face when they sell the goat for meat",

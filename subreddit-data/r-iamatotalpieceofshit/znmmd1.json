Some days I had the dexterity of an arthritic 80 year old. I could have a fight but I was a lot better when I weighed a lot less as a Royal Marine than when I bulked up. Ironically you tend to get into a lot less fights when you stack yourself big because smaller guys avoid you and bigger guys know how much time you put in down the gym so kind of give you that nod of like recognising like. I met a guy in my building in the UK who was a really serious Nigerian gangster but he was scared of needles so once a week I\u2019d go down to his flat which was always full of some serious looking guys and we\u2019d go into the bathroom, he\u2019d pull down his pants and I\u2019d inject his ass for him with testosterone. The kind of leader of them all though was this 5ft5 skinny Ghanaian guy and everyone was terrified of him despite him having the same body size as the average 15 year old. I was in a club with him one time and he asked me if I wanted a pill and didn\u2019t want seem rude so said yes and he just went up to this drug dealer dude and robbed him right there and took the drugs off him without any kind of weapon. The drug dealer tried to resist a little bit and later as I was leave the club I saw him on the road outside unconscious with a police officer stood next to him apparently unfazed by this guy who was knocked out. I later learned that white Irish traveler\u2019s owned the club and they control most of the cocaine trade in the UK and they are all banned from betting shops because they fix the races so they use these African guys I was friends with to place huge bets for them. It was one of those situations where I didn\u2019t mind being the occasional organised criminal lifestyle tourist but definitely didn\u2019t want be part of their world. So I\u2019d definitely agree the most dangerous people are usually not the biggest but the average civilian doesn\u2019t know that and that\u2019s why I bulked up because I got tired of people not realising I was athletic and lightweight because I was a Royal Marine Commando who looked average size with a jumper on but it didn\u2019t mean I was average when it came to having a fight. Bulking up made it harder for me to fight but I didn\u2019t really have to.",

BUT...lol...there's always that one guy that's looking for trouble and wanting to cause problems.  Led to a few interesting nights out!",

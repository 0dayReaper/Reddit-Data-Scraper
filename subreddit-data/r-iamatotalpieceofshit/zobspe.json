I have been a victim of it: from being shamed about cutting to being told I did it for attention by a first responder (who didn't check my diagnosis or medical history) to having been done painful unnecessary procedures against my will (nasogastric tubes when it was useless or completely unneeded) just to teach me a lesson.",

Because of my two attempts, when I was sick, a doctor that I went to immediately dismissed all of my symptoms and said I just wanted attention because \u201cbeing suicidal was no longer working for that\u201d. In all fairness, I did want attention, I wanted MEDICAL ATTENTION. Turns out, my fucking appendix ruptured and I was in the hospital for nearly 2 weeks with the resulting sepsis. \nHappy ending though, my father is a prominent lawyer and knows other prominent lawyers. We sued him since the idiot actually wrote that quote on his medical report about me and ended up getting his license revoked, costing him his job, and a nice 50,000 settlement on top of paid medical bills.",

I remember being attacked from behind by someone on the street. Mentioned it to my paramedic buddy, \"well you must have done something\". I've been told stories about medical staff handing people over to police to be driven to the middle of nowhere, when they get there the cop tells them this is their only chance and next time they are taken out here they will be killed. This was usually done to prostitutes or homeless people who caused regular problems.",

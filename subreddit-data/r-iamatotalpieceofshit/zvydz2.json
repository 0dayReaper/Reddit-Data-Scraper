I know that this sub can get a lot of assholes and it can sometimes feel easy to view all the users that way after a while, but I try to be fair and do my best to give people the benefit of the doubt. I would like mods like that.",

It's something different and it will let you mod other subs because putting this one on an app is huge.\n\nThe sub itself consists of banning a lot of racists and this often leads to them being banned from Reddit itself. You're also protecting innocent people from getting doxxed by their psycho neighbor for parking in front of their house or that random guy on the bus that had their advances turned down and took a photo of them. People make shit up to try and get users to witch hunt them.\n\nFor the people that dislike you.. I mean, I'm always empathetic with users and have had great experiences due to it. The people who dislike me I generally don't lose any sleep over lol. The other mods are nice too.",

It really takes me back to the year I spent teaching English in China. I actually left after 8 months because it was so demeaning. I taught in Japan for a year and got pretty good at it, but in China we were made to dance and jump around, basically act like clowns. We were there to teach children that Western people are not to be taken seriously.",

Similar to other social media but due to the design and the primary audience, it is worse. It is also designed to collect data from the user when not using the app so while the Chinese government don't care about a random middle class 17 year old boy. It may collect information about the 17 year old boy who is the son of a intelligence officer. The app collects info just by being install on a phone.\n\nIt also promotes Chinese messages though not always overtly. It famously has more political misinformation compared to other social media. I occasionally sees white men (they often use non-Chinese speakers, they are targeting young white audience) promoting how well the Chinese government built so many wonderful infrastructure and how great their system is. Even using American young men to make odd accusations. For example I saw a video saying that American interest in Kpop and Japanese media is US propaganda to hate Chinese media. That there is so many great Chinese movies that the US and the West are ignoring, etc.\n\nNow, these are not common and certainly not there majority but its there and I was initially only there to see women dancing.",

Pickled pigs feet in the south vibes? Full disclaimer; I've never been to Korea and I'm basing my info off a random food documentary several years ago so I could be totally wrong.",

Avocados, bananas, cocoa, dairy (not vegetative, but depends on vegetation and land), soy, sugar cane, cotton, rice, palm oil etc. or just any industrial farming. You see, there wouldn't be a problem if 40% of food in the U.S. didn't end up in waste. There'd be less land use if that 40% went to &lt;5%. A lot of the Amazon forest is being destroyed for palm oil, avocado farms are causing droughts, desertification, and negative anthropological affects on the environment with constant pesticide and fertilizer use. Avocado plantations are replacing natural vegetation in Mexico and causing deforestation. Palm oil plantations increasing soil pollution and water contamination. Etc. You get the point.\n\nEveryone loves to point to meat eaters, and yes, meat is more expensive in terms of carbon footprint, but those who judge meat eaters look at themselves like they're some sort of saints, but they eat avocados, which have fucked up the environment in so many ways because of their heavy water dependancy.\n\nRenewable poultry farming is so much less harmful to the environment than non-renewable great white shark poaching. It does not even compare.",

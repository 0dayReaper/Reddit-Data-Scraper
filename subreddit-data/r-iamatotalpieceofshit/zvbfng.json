Now that Asian men are finally being recognized as viable dating partners they feel their dominance over the dating pool is threatened and they frequently get the urge to react violently.\n\nNotice the assailant in this video attacked only the guy and it was unprovoked.   He attacked his race and sexuality. \n\nHe was triggered that an Asian man was on a date and was trying to demean him in front of the woman. Plain and simple.\n\nEdit: This is also why Asian men are portrayed as \"little dicked nerds\" and Asian women as \"submissive white-lovers\", it's all boomer tactics of \"kill the men and take the women.\"  It'd be nice if we just all saw each other as equals and left people alone and let them be with whoever they want to be with no matter race or gender or whatever.",

Shamelessly copypasting my comment over from elsewhere:\n\nI've been assaulted by someone who asked if I was gay before the attack.\n\nLearned from the police afterwards that it is apparently a thing for closeted homosexual men to lash out at guys they're attracted to. Like basically they're ashamed of their desires, don't like them, so they irrationally lash out at \"the source\" at times. They're also prone to starting an interaction because it's like giving a tiny bit into temptation and talking to someone they find attractive, but then of course they have to justify to themselves it's not about giving into temptation by doing something hostile or whatever.\n\nSuper fucking likely the aggressor is actually attracted to this guy. The girl was actually spot-on when she told him to \"stop\" because if that's really what was unfolding here, the guy's jokes about offering gay sex could've REALLY set the guy off.\n\nBut hey, on the bright side for this guy and myself: some hostile closeted homosexual dude found us hot. So there's that. Thanks for the compliment, hostile closeted homosexual dude.",

They're on the path to self destruction. Don't join them on that path. \n\nI mean, here's a good example. One of the best jiu-jitsu fighters in the world...

You took something that was awful and let it pass by you like someone who truly knows both their self-worth and they're worth as a human being. That's not something that everyone can do and you both did it at such a young age (I'm 39). Sorry you had to experience that. You are both awesome. I wish you the best.",

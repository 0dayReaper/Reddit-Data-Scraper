Yes the front bumper is unpainted black plastic while the rest of the paint job is a dirty chipped silver. Yes the roof lining is collapsed so it messes up my hair whenever I don\u2019t wear a hat. Yes it gets 18 miles to the gallon. Yes it\u2019s huge and unwieldy and a pain in the ass to park. Yes it\u2019s the ugliest car in any given group of cars that aren\u2019t Porsche Panameras or a Pontiac Aztec. Yes it\u2019s gears are mushy and slow to respond. Yes I got it used and there\u2019s all kinds of junk including random pills in the crevices of the seats. Yes the fan in the climate control system works a solid 95% of the time. Yes it\u2019s a Limited with tons of extra features that mostly don\u2019t work. Yes the interior lights behind all the radio/climate controls are out so I can\u2019t read them at night. \n\nBut besides all that, it\u2019s basically the perfect car.",

It\u2019s like 3 hours long, most of which is the protagonist living out their days in melancholic agony, all the while they simply observe the person that killed/maimed their family. Nothing is ever spoken of a plan. Nothing mentioned to friends or family, nothing is ever written down or shown on screen.\n\nNot until the last 10 minutes of the film when your (and the protagonist\u2019s) patience finally pays off and you see them unleash holy hell on the drunk driver.\n\nIt\u2019d be hard to sell in Hollywood but I could see it as an Indy film \u00af\\\\_(\u02d8\u0361\u02d8\u032f)_/\u00af",

One restriction is that your BAC must be 0.00%, as opposed to the 0.05% allowed to fully licensed drivers.\n\nSo I'm 18, driving on a restricted license, and I go to a party with full intention of staying overnight and not driving.  I have one beer. Party's kinda lame so I decide I'm going to leave early.  I wait around for about 45 minutes to make sure I'm 100% sober and I drive home.  Sure enough, I get pulled over.  The cop asked if I'd had anything to drink tonight and I said yes because I was 18 and dumb and now realize that lying could have got me out of this entirely.\n\nSo he breathalyzes me and I blow 0.017.  Just for reference, even 0.05 is practically sober. That's why they let people drive at that level.  I was even more sober than that. \n\nThe cop tells me he fully understands my story and he's even on my side, but policy demands that he submit the results.  And as a result I lose my license for 3 months and got a huge fine.",

If you do, it\u2019s an automatic 2 year license suspension, fines, substance abuse classes, and community service. \n\nGranted, I\u2019m sure most get pleaded down to reckless driving if they\u2019re not over .08.\n\nBUT, cops here can also book you for DUI if you\u2019re over 21 and below 0.08\u2026 You can technically get a DUI here and blow 0.00, but I don\u2019t know how many of those actually result in a conviction. Same goes for simply walking to your car. If they think you\u2019re drunk and walking to a parking garage with car keys in your pocket you can be arrested (happened to a bartender at a spot I used to visit - unsure of the outcome). \n\nI had a DUI (over 21) pleaded down to reckless driving. A couple/few years later on my way home from dinner I was pulled over for rolling through a stop sign (\u2026barely..) guy asked if I had anything to drink because he can smell some beer on my breath. I had one light beer at dinner, idk what I told him though. Anyway, blew like a .01, he said with my DUI showing up on his computer I shouldn\u2019t risk drinking *at all*, and that he knows numerous cops on his beat who would easily have arrested me even though I was really \u201cotherwise\u201d (barely rolled it) driving fine. He gave me a warning for the rolling stop. Since then I haven\u2019t taken the chance once. I always come to a full stop when drinking and driving. \u2026no but seriously, I won\u2019t have a drink if I know I\u2019ll be driving. We have some of the strictest rules on DUI\u2019s and probably some of the harshest penalties. Had a friend from out of town say the trick is to deny the breathalyzer that way when they take your blood your BAC is lower. Well, I told him, if you do that here you\u2019ll automatically lose your license for a year. No matter anything else that happens, even if you\u2019re innocent.",

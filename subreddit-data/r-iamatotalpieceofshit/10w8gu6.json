You can argue cruelty in any situation should be avoided and while that would be ideal, humans are complicated and our decisions about food are intertwined with issues of hunger, culture, tradition, economics, and politics. Cruelty for the sake of a gender reveal party has none of those things attached. \n\nPlant based eating is getting more popular every day and opening the door for incremental change is more effective than moral gotchas. \n\nAlso, let's not forget that the agricultural industry is plenty cruel to humans as well. Even vegans don't have the moral high ground and most could probably do better  to ensure their food didn't involve human trafficking, inhumane working conditions, exploitation of other countries, etc. \n\nIt's ok to say this situation is fucked up without being perfect.",

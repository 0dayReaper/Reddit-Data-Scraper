There are 2 camo-clad medics right behind the police line who move in to render proper aid at the end of the video. The push itself is much worse than their doing nothing to help afterward, because they would just be getting in the way of people who know what they are doing if they did try to help.",

There really are very limited circumstances in which an armed individual will be needed in most situations where emergency services are called. I heard a commentator on NPR say something so simple yet so mind blowing once: every time a police officer enters a situation, a gun is now involved. And once a gun is involved, it\u2019s use is now a possible solution.\n\nThis is especially true with LE as they\u2019re trained that every person and every call is a possible life threatening situation. The gun is definitely a top thought solution.",

Nothing will ever change until the courts start prosecuting bad cops and since that\u2019s probably never going to happen the only way these pieces of shit are going to learn is by using their own tactics against them. \n\nTo be clear, I am not advocating for the extrajudicial killing of police officers. I\u2019m just saying I think that\u2019s the logical next step to years of systemic oppression and corruption without repercussions for police if no serious changes are made.",

At 1:22 p.m. on June 3, Aurora police officer John Reiter was dispatched to the store after a security camera caught a man stealing a shirt and two belts.\n\n&gt;In the ensuing pursuit, Seacat\u2014now on foot\u2014crossed a pedestrian bridge, a fence, one of Denver's busiest highways, another fence, and Village Greens Park, which backs up directly to the 4200 block of South Alton Street. The suspect broke into Lech's property by entering through the back door, tripping one alarm\n\n&gt; court documents provide a startling summary of the police arsenal: 50 SWAT officers bombarded Lech's property with 40 mm rounds, tear gas, flashbang grenades, two armored Bearcats, and breaching rams. A total of \"68 cold chemical munitions and four hot gas munitions\" were detonated inside the Greenwood Village home.\n\n&gt;Almost every window and external door was a wide gaping hole after the raid. Pieces of household items\u2014furniture, appliances, clothing\u2014blended into the piles of building debris in the front and back yards. The young boy's bedroom, still sporting childhood artwork on the walls, was fully exposed to the elements after a grenade detonated inside of it, leaving a 10-foot hole in the external wall. The backyard fence was partially toppled by a Bearcat used to breach the back door.\n\n&gt;**the house was condemned by the local municipality immediately after the raid. The inspector spent only a few minutes examining the property before calling it a \"complete loss.\" But the City of Greenwood Village offered Lech a measly $5,000 in compensation for his out-of-pocket insurance deductible and temporary living assistance for his displaced family.**",

That is the failure of the prosecution to prove that the shooter had knowing possession of a firearm, and/or intentionally used it to harm someone. He claimed he found it wrapped under a bench and accidentally discharged it while unwrapping it. They didn't prove otherwise, hence he wasn't convicted of manslaughter. Involuntary manslaughter requires a death to happen \"through the negligent or reckless actions of the defendant\". Unless you consider picking up the trash under a bench to be reckless, or it is proven that isn't what happened, how can you convict? You certainly couldn't prove 2nd degree murder considering the bullet ricocheted off of the pavement, even charging that was fucking stupid. Almost as stupid is comparing that case to the obvious, intentional, unnecessary infliction of bodily harm against a protestor.",

Most objective people would say based on the evidence that these officer's did not intend to cause such a serious injury when the pushed Mr. Gugino.\n\nThis was a political move by the DA, he placated the masses by charging them during the summer, but knew they would not be indicted or at least not be found guilty because there was not enough evidence to support the felony charge. \n\nAt which point he can say say that he did all he could to hold them accountable but the grand jury wouldn't indict.\n\nIf he really wanted to hold them accountable he would have charged them with misdemeanor assault, which they may have been convicted of.",

But electing a congressperson or mayor who will echo these ideas, and not just say they understand is important. Maybe canvass or phone bank for these candidates. Do research on the candidates in the primary and vote for the one who is at least second most likely to make it to the general if there are a lot of candidates. Because one who will listen and might win is better than one who will agree but people don't want to vote for (for a variety of legitimate reasons). Primaries still devolve into a two party system regardless of how little we encourage it.  \n\nI'm lucky that I can vote by mail in Washington so I have a lot of time to do this stuff. I understand it's a lot harder for most of the country.  \n\nThat's at least for the US, not sure how it is in other countries. But here the primary might as well be the general, because that's where I feel like I vote for reform, the general is just to prevent harm.",

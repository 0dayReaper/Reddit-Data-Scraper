The idea of a pack hierarchy with alphas was based on a study of an entirely male population of captive wolves. It\u2019d be like if aliens studied male prisoners at a federal penitentiary and decided that sample was representative of all human behavior. Wolves don\u2019t operate under a vicious hierarchy, they operate as an interdependent family where the success of the individual directly promotes the success of the pack.",

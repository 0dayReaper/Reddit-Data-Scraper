You can search for a radius around your address. \n\nAlso, for new home buyers, I recommend doing this before you sign the P&amp;S Agreement because if you discover that you\u2019re neighbor is a possible threat to your family, you may not get your full deposit back, as due diligence is on the buyer, including checking public records. (I was an attorney in one such law suit, and my Seller client got a confidential but not inconsiderable settlement for letting Buyer out of the contract. Both families had children, and neither knew until a week before closing that there was an Offender across the way!).",

Officially sentenced for 71 murders but claiming to have killed over 100 drug dealers, rapists, and murderers, he served 34 years in prison (about 25 weeks per murder) before his release in 2007. In 2011, Rodrigues was imprisoned again on charges of inciting riot and deprivation of liberty; he was sentenced to eight years in prison, but was released again in 2018 after seven years on good behavior.[3] His victims included 47 prisoners (primarily rapists) whom he murdered inside the prisons in which he was imprisoned.",

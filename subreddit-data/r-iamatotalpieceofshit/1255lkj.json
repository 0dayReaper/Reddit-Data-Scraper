I tried to share it as a response to your question. \n\nAnyway, as for my life, I got out, became an addict at 34, and did meth. Pretty much lost everything, and then I got hooked on fentanyl and became homeless for 4 or 5 years. \n\n2 years ago, I moved back to the country with my ex-wife. I beat the addiction, although I had 3 relapses. I am 1 year and 11 days clean. Last month, I asked my ex-wife to marry me again, and she said yes.\n\nSo, as I type this, I am in the passenger seat while my ex-wife/fianc\u00e9 drives with my 7 year old behind me with my mother in law beside him, going to pick up my 15 year old son and helping my 25 year old daughter move into her very first apartment. \n\nSo, even though things were pretty fucked up along the way, I wouldn't change a thing because it all worked out. I'll share my favorite quote with you now that it actually pertains to me...\n\n\"I may not have gone where I wanted to go, but I think I ended up where I needed to be.\"",

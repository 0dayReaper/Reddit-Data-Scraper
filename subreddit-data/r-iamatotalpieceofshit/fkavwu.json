            "comment": "Those are Jefferson Parish police officers in Louisiana. The audio is missing but the man on the ground is saying that there isn\u2019t any crack. The black cop is talking to someone yelling behind them so that\u2019s why the cop who dropped the bag looks over his shoulder first. Then you hear a woman in the background say she\u2019s recording right as he\u2019s dropping the bag. When he notices them, he stands up and walks towards the camera and you hear a woman in the background tell the woman recording to get in the house.\n\n[Added link to article](https://www.fox8live.com/2020/03/17/jefferson-parish-sheriffs-office-investigating-arrest-caught-viral-video/)",

Interrogating you about what you're doing even when you're minding your own business. Ordering you to do things like lay down, or show them your hands, or put down your umbrella because they see it as a weapon, all while they have a hand on a firearm. Inn that situation you're expected to be highly anxious. A good police officer treats civilians as equal human beings. The cops are supposed to be there to protect us from the real bad guys but they instead choose to act like them. 99% of people that haven't already been slighted by police are willing to comply with them with things that are reasonable. \n\nCop says they got a call that your music is too loud. 99% of people would just say okay and turn down the music and they both would go on their way. Instead, assuming you're not a white 50+ year old male, the cop will pull up, hand on gun, demand to know what you're doing and why you're doing it and where you live and why you are where you are and then tell you to show them your hands and if they feel like it put you in handcuffs and make you sit or lie face down on the ground and once they are in complete control of the situation tell you that your music is too loud. If you happened to say no or refused to answer any of those questions then they will get aggressive and threaten to arrest you for resisting them. \n\nWell now that person tells their friends and family about it. Those friends and family may have never had a single run in with a cop in their life but you can be damn sure they are going to be anxious everytime they see one. The only experience I have is getting pulled over one time when I was younger because my broken muffler was too loud. Cop literally just gave me a warning but his posture, hand placement, tone, word choice, and just everything about the way he acted just made me feel extremely uncomfortable and like at any moment he could just randomly start yelling at me arrest me.",

I think the pay came out to be somewhere around $10.00 an hour. I didn't end up taking the job but everybody else I tested with resigned within 6 months. Oh, and one guy ended up in prison himself.",

I didn't know it had a nickname, makes sense though! Where I live now and have 99% of my life, if you have a warrant that's not for something crazy, the only way you're gonna go to jail is a chance traffic stop pretty much unless you skipped bail and have a hunter after you",

It\u2019s not like he got it out of his cruiser or something or can be heard saying \u201cplant this shit on him\u201d or something similar, so it\u2019s entirely possible that this clip doesn\u2019t have all of the answers in it. Maybe a longer video will shed light on some of the questions being raised?\n\nIs there longer video somewhere, showing the events prior to when this short clip starts? Also, when was this video taken? I didn\u2019t see a time stamp on it but I might have missed someone else pointing it out.",

To sat the least it was eventful.\n\nOne day a skinny older homeless dude came in and started ordering. Which wouldn't he super suspect except for the fact that he very visibly didn't have any pockets, he was in absolutely disgustingly dirty pajamas and a very loose sleeveless t-shirt.  So we could already tell the man was aiming to either overdose in our bathroom  or get up to some other kind of meth-foolery. \n\nWell as he's ordering' his hand slides onto our tip cup. And he grabs it and makes a run for it.....\n\nHere's the thing, apparently this happened so often that the local hooligans had figured out they could just really rip at the tip jar and it would break the flimsy chain and they could make their get away.  So my manager installed a very long, very thick chain that was fed up from the bottom of the ordering counter for about 7 feet of length.\n\n\nAs this dude turns around, not realizing what the tip jar is pulling behind it, he  gets about 5 steps and mid sprint the tension of the chain hits and he flings back, HARD.  he hits the hard concrete floor so hard he winds himself. He's sitting they're choking for air and wheezing as my manager walks over with his phone and takes a pic of him.  Tells him the cops are gonna be called and his photos going up on the wall of shame.\n\nHe hobbles away defeated, duped by the chain and probably with a sore back/shoulders all for maybe 5$ worth of peoples loose change.",

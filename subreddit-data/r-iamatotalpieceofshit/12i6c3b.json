Meaning that it is ammunition specifically designed for anti-personnel usage. Regular, ball ammo typically stays as one large, malformed projectile after impact. Hollow points, however, are designed to splinter off and collapse into smaller bullet fragments upon impact, thereby increasing the chance of hitting a major artery or organ and ultimately increasing their lethality. \n\nAll freedom seeds are bad for your body. \n\nBut hollow point freedom seeds are especially bad.",

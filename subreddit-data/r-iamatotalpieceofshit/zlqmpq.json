In this situation there are two different options: 1) let the kid drown because it is inconvenient for you to wade into the pool, or 2) walk into a shallow pool where you can stand on the bottom and pull the kid out.  It feels like basic human decency to wade into the pool to save the kid.    \n\n\nNow, if the kid was drowning in rapids then the main deterrent for jumping in the water is the risk of harm to one's self, not inconvenience.

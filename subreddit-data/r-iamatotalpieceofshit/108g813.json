It also shows why federal law is so important, to have an effective policy.\n\n700$ is not much at all, and i would never fault SF for this. If that tiny amount is helping more homeless people, then good. People deserve more than this, but until then, we should praise SF for showing a minimum of humanitarian standards, and taking steps to lift people out of poverty with financial opportunity.",

They knew all the tourist stops, the places the busses would drop us off.  They had people with no limbs, no eyes, with disabled children.  I saw a dirty child at one stop, then later I would see the same child, but now with a different disabled \"father\".  \n\nThe tour company is in on it too.  Perhaps not with the beggars, but with the crappy tourist traps...  \n\nThen it clicked... They are basically the same thing...  It's all a show to get money.\n\nThat being said I do know many people who were homeless.  They never begged and just used resource.  All the people I knew who begged, were my fellow drug using teen friends looking for door money to tonight's rave...  The girls would always make extra, enough for some goodies bought at the rave.\n\nSo I dunno, that's my experience, but I still wouldn't be cruel like this or anything close",

People would be provided durable tents that would stay on site. There would be security and perhaps a safe injection site. By centralizing everything it makes the job easier for social workers. Similar to how a hospital works or going to the super market - everything in one place. \n\nIf this were the case,the city could prevent people from literally just plopping down and sitting on the street. And the public wouldn\u2019t feel bad if they got picked up and asked to camp somewhere safe. Somewhere with a toilet and sanitary sink. \n\nInstead our tax dollars just flow into some defunct feedback loop, where nothing really changes. \n\nYou can be empathetic and upset at the same time. We\u2019re enabling the situation. \n\nAllowing humans to live in squalor and fester on the street does zero good for everyone.",

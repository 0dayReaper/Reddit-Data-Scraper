Your trial is so far in the future that you're stuck for years. Then you get your trial, and finally you prove you're innocent. Bummer. \n\nKeeping the obvious cases out of the courts helps expedite the cases that should be deliberated on.\n\nImagine the amount of work that would go into a trial for every case.

Say you are innocent but your looking at a trial that could give you life or the death penalty, where odds are you wont win because a jury is a flawed system forcing people with little or no experience with the justice system to decide your innocence. Your other option is to take a plea for a lesser charge that gets you 10-15 years. I don't know about you but I don't trust a trial by jury and a bench trial has to be approved. Most of the time even your lawyer will push you into a plea.\nI honestly think there should be professional jury members. People who have gone through some training in law and critical thinking who do trials for a living. That cuts down on jury selection time as well making trials and deliberation a more efficient task. \nIt's still not perfect, obviously, but it's something.",

However, he was never going to be denied the possibility of parole, because this wasn't a first degree murder charge. Which means a life sentence would have been 25 years to life, with the possibility of parole after 25 years. With the sentence he was given, he must serve at least 85% of it because it is a federal crime (which is 36 years) before he has the possibility of parole. This sentence is much harsher (and rightfully so) than a life sentence. People in the thread are just clueless when it comes to this stuff.",

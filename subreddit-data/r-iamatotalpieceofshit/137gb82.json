Our bosses told us that any cliff jumping results in termination. I jumped it earlier and it was pretty stupid. I\u2019m fine with smaller cliffs but I couldn\u2019t stop shaking for hours after. I mean every year staff jump it, and this was the first time ever that someone from camp got injured. A few weeks after, a local kid jumped it and was killed.",

And most likely she felt and still feels absolutely horrible about it and I\u2019d bet it significantly affected her life (probably not as much as the girl she pushed but that\u2019s beside the point).\n\nIt was effectively a really dumb mistake which she won\u2019t make again.\n\nUnless it was purposeful and she was actually trying to hurt/kill her friend (I know everyone loves to believe the absolute worst about everyone else, but come on), jail time is pointless and would only bring more suffering into this world.\n\nIncarceration shouldn\u2019t be about revenge, it should be about prevention and reform. This woman isn\u2019t a risk, and will feel guilty about this and be shamed for it for the rest of her life.\n\nAll the bullshit complaining about her not serving enough time is just blind hatred and ego stroking. I know people will try to justify it with \u201cwell she did it once so she\u2019ll always be a threat!\u201d That\u2019s just the typical extreme ego-boosting internet cynicism, go fucking touch grass",

I haven't had a stroke before, but I've had some medical issues that have left me 100% vulnerable and at the mercy of those around me. I was absolutely terrified. It's indescribable if you've never felt it before,  just primal terror. Luckily, I had others to help me.\n\nThis poor woman had people *actively harming her further.* She had no help. She was trying and trying to advocate for herself, and she was mocked and antagonized. All those people around you that could help and just... no one does. I cannot fathom what she must have been feeling in her last moments. \n\nI wish I hadn't watched this. This fucked me up.",

She later sought additional medical attention at the hospital she was arrested and discharged and refused to leave because she knew something was wrong! She was left physically disabled back in 2019 after suffering from her first stroke.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the award! Also to add the officers involved were not charged with her death. The DA stated \" that Edwards died of a stroke and that none of the officers who handled her arrest will face charges. The medical examiner's report stated, \u201cat no time did law enforcement interaction cause or contribute to Ms. Edwards\u2019 death.\u201d Ya'll wonder why people are trying to fight for police and healthcare reform. This is why because this should have never happened.",

The police are responsible because they stopped making objective observations of their \u201cprisoner\u201d which to anyone not in a biased state of mind would have seen the seriousness of the situation.\n\nHer family should be able to collect a massive settlement from the city for the police\u2019s negligence.

They don't have to prove she can get there or anything though.  People are in the comments, if she is just some \"smelly homeless lady\", I'm sure the slurred words were assumed to be drunkenness and there was a cursory assessment of the ankle.\n\nIt's a terrible country sometimes. A friend of my mother's was in the hospital and on a ventilator, they took out the tube, and the second she was off supplemental oxygen, they discharged her. She still couldn't feed herself or walk and was having hallucinations. But she wasn't on Medicare and had no insurance.\n\nI have been a nurse a long time and I am just grateful I always worked with kids since all States have some sort of insurance for children and they get at least some sort of Healthcare. Of course, that also meant I had to sit in on a meeting with a 17 year old young man and his medical team so he could be told he would be removed from the heart transplant list on his 18th birthday. We had to discuss his living will since he was 100% going to die if he didn't get a heart before that date. America!",

I never do drugs and I don't even drink, and literally told them \"I don't drink or do drugs. I don't want any drugs\". But none of that mattered. They still incorrectly assumed I was an addict and told me to leave after running NO tests. Thankfully I collapsed while trying to stand and passed out, because that seemed to make them finally realize I wasn't faking. Woke up to hear a nurse yelling at the doctor as I was being wheeled away to get scans. Ended up being admitted for organ trauma. When I later saw the doctor again he had the nerve to say to me \"I guess you weren't faking after all\". I gave him the middle finger and replied \"I guess you're not much of a doctor after all\". I was assigned a different doctor after that and my care finally improved. The American Healthcare system (and that doctor in particular) can go f*ck itself.",

I had huge cysts on both ovaries that hadn't burst or gone away for about 8 months. Then I got ovarian torsion. So, so much pain, the only time in my life I was hurting too bad to walk.\n\nDoctors didn't explicitly say they didn't believe me, likely bc my mom was there (I was 19) but they refused to admit me or treat me. They said it was a simple surgery, but it \"should resolve on its own\". Yeah, they said that about the cysts too, months ago. My mom and I kept asking for them to admit me, do the simple surgery, please. But no, they sent me home with a basic painkiller prescription and said come back if they burst. Nobody even documented my many requests to be admitted.\n\nLuckily I already had a surgery planned about a month later to remove the cysts because guess what? The twisted ovary didn't fix itself. It kept twisting, the cysts locked it in place, cut off blood flow, and my left ovary died inside me. The dead ovary was leaking into the cysts, swelling the cysts with dead blood and tissue, and my doc said if I had sneezed wrong that cyst could have burst, sending dead tissue all throughout my abdomen, likely killing me before anyone knew what happened.\n\nBecause they didn't listen to me, or to my pain, they killed a 19 year old's ovary, and almost killed me too. I'm so pissed about this years later.",

I was too weak/in pain/confused to say anything. It took 30 minutes before the triage nurses assessed me and realized it was a STEMI (widow maker).

The federal EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment &amp; Labor Act) mandates that all medical facilities, even if incapable of completing full treatment and even if the patient is unable to pay, must have a qualified provider fully evaluate a patient and determine if there is a need for medical care. If there is need, she must be stabilized and treated or transferred. I'm a nurse and a simple observation from this video shows something is very wrong, especially if she's saying she broke an ankle and had a stroke. If she was discharged without a complete evaluation (CAT scan for supposed stroke and X-ray for her ankle along with lab tests), then the hospital and provider are liable for lawsuit and massive fines. If they did their due diligence and a CAT scan and X-ray came up negative along with any other tests to rule out her obvious ailments, then it wouldn't be their fault but it's pretty obvious to me they failed her and caused her death through negligence. They denied her a basic human right and should be held accountable.",

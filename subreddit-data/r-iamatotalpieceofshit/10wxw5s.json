They kill each other with machetes, vehicles etc. They've been known to kick off at the graves during cemetery Sunday (mass for the dead) it usually ends in blood and makes the local news. Not all are like that so I'm not trying to generalise but only make mention of specifics I'm aware of.",

I would love to know what the outcome was, with the other gals parents and police....once there's a video there's NO denying the crime. \n The girl was actually kicking the other girls butt until she got jumped by 4 more ppl.  \"Kick her in the face and keep doing it?\"  She certainly wants her kids to end up in prison for killing someone or serious bodily harm.

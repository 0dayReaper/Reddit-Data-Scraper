Her response was \u201ctell anyone and you\u2019re fired\u201d. She said this on a late night talk show as a \u201cfunny\u201d anecdote. No wonder Velma sucked.\n\nEDIT: It appears I was wrong and thankfully the user below corrected me. She actually kissed the costar, not a picture.",

He was just looming above me, and **he asked me a question, I was not listening to him at all because who cares what he was saying, and I was just like \u2018mhmm, mhmm,\u2019 [and kissed him]**. And well, he reacted [shocked] and I pretended it didn\u2019t happen, and then I walked backstage [where] we have two writer-producers.\u201d",

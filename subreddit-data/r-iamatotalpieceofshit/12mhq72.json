I've been in the reptile hobby/trade for around 7 years and the constant neglect I see on a regular basis basically killed my love for the hobby. The amount of times I need to tell somebody feedong their dragon 10 crickets once a week isn't enough, they need prooer lightint and *can't* be kept in a 10 gallon tank... Oy. People like this guy, the ones that will deliberately neglect or harm an animal for views and likes, they have to be the lowest of the low",

There's some that have issues yes unfortunately , however there's so many wonderful people out there willing to work with them and help them through their issues and giving them a soft place to land.  My personal favorite is the oldsters.  I've always brought the old farts into our home over the years. They deserve a comfortable and loving home in their final years.

Super kind and as simple as they come. If you took a look at her , you wouldn\u2019t even guess that she was a multimillionaire who spent most of her money on her rescue dog farms in Brazil.",

Rescue dogs are a little trickier to handle at times (some dogs may have trauma, panic disorder, anxiety attacks, or just simple aggression), but you\u2019re giving it a chance to live a comfortable life filled with love, bonding, and play. My parents have a rescue dog (little golden doodle, poor thing probably had an abusive owner and was found behind a dumpster, skinny as a q-tip and scars where her fur should be), and even though it was supposedly tough for her to warm up to them, she turned out to be the sweetest, most playful, most attention-loving dog ever. She started out rough but my parents are giving her a really good life. I totally recommend getting a rescue dog, you won\u2019t regret it",

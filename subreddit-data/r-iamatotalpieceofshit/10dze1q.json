They also say they ran out of the 100 years of supply in 15 years (in Texas). He also (funnily) says but not to worry because there is 100 years of supply in Wyoming (isn't that also going to run out faster as consumption rates increase even more?) Thanks for the watch though, interesting. Love Tom Scott.",

Anyways, I wake up and my inbox has all these questions as it uploaded overnight. Here's the full list of what happened:\n\n\n\n1. I get a delivered notification while I'm at work and ask one of my family members to check the gate. Most delivery people either hide stuff behind a flower pot (which he tried to do here initially before running off - I have the photo if anyone cares to see it), throw it over, or ring the buzzer. Package is a new laptop.\n\n\n\n\n2. Family says nothing is there, so we pull up our camera feed and voila, thief. Unfortunately for him, Roadie's tracking app gives me his name and picture alongside the 'delivered' photo. Bye-bye job.\n\n\n\n\n3. I contact Best Buy about getting a new laptop and then send all the evidence to Roadie's fraud email. As I'm looking up my wonderful drivers photo on reverse image searches, I get a voice mail from a Roadie representative about how they're looking into it.\n\n\n\n\n4. Then I get a text chain where they tried to say that he DID deliver it, just further down the treeline, so we go out and look again for good measure, but this video is cropped and we can see him drive down the whole treeline without stopping. Still no laptop. I threaten legal action and they backpedal into apologies.\n\n\n\n\n5. I never did find a match to the image. I was planning on finding him and then his mom for ultimate guilt trip, but it seems he either has private socials or none at all. He's probably already lost his job at this point, so whatever.\n\n\n\nDid I miss anything? On mobile sorry.",

If they attempt (or claim they attempted) three times, it gets sent back. \n\nThey leave this little pink slip that says \"sorry we missed you!\" and has some information on it. Which would be nice, but they often pre-fill these, put them in the box with the rest of the mail and don't even bother to try to get the recipient to sign. They just claim they did. At one point I saw my local one do this, I went outside to go get my package, and he refused to give it to me. Literally chased the mailman who had my mail, that he decided to not deliver and wouldn't give me. Guy throws that pre-filled pink slip in the box and drives away lightning fast; it's clear when they have zero intention of delivering the package; they're gone while you're still processing that he has your mail and drove away with it.\n\nYou can take the pink slip to the local post office and they'll hold the package instead of guy trying to deliver it. If he already has it out again while youre doing this, that's an attempt. Even if you asked for a hold, if he \"attempts\" three times they'll often send it back anyway. After requesting the hold you still have to go back to the post office again, on another day, to pick it up yourself. \n\nIt's a huge pain in the ass. I've had some expensive items returned to the sender this way, sometimes overseas, and had to eat the cost to have it reshipped. In one instance I lost the item entirely and it took me two or three months before I could source and order another one, and another month shipping. Took my lunch on the delivery day to go get the pink slip I knew would be there to the post office same day, and they still almost returned the fucking thing. \n\nI usually request no signatures on delivery when I order stuff, because the sender determines what type of shipping they're going to use. Because of the way our postal system acts with these, it's often safer to skip signature on delivery than it is to risk the USPS doing their best to make sure you can't sign for your mail. If I absolutely have to, I'll have those sent to the mail room at work where I know the carrier won't pull a stunt like that. Partly because I know him and he wouldnt do that, and partly because he couldn't get away with it if he tried.",

Many apartment buildings or communities provide package services where things can be left in a locked container or at a staffed office.  You can often opt to have a package delivered to a nearby \"pickup point\" such as the neighborhood drug or grocery store.  There are package stores that provide similar services.  There are types of delivery that will not leave the package unless you are there, it goes back to the depot and they usually try again a few times or allow you to retrieve it from the delivery company local office.\n\nYou only see videos online of packages being stolen because that person has elected to have it left out where it can be stolen, which is one of many options we have.",

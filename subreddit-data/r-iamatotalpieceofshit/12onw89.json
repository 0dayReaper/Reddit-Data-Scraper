It's no Auschwitz, but 50,000 people died there, and it was the most harrowing experience of my life. It might seem strange to describe it as a privilege, but that's really how I feel about it. To be allowed to visit a place where such a horrific thing happened, to be trusted with the memory of so many victims of such an awful crime, it really is a privilege.\n\nLuckily, my school was right to trust us with it, and we were all well-behaved and respectful, which you might not expect from a bunch of 14/15 year olds. Some cried, and some had to stop the tour part way through and wait outside, which is totally understandable. Most of us, though, (me included) just listened to our tour guide, looked at all the displays of photos and belongings of victims, the rooms where they stayed, the furnaces, the mass graves, all in total silence. I didn't really feel any of the emotions that you might expect while I was there, I didn't feel sad, I didn't feel angry, I didn't feel sick, all those emotions came later and I cried when we got back to our hotel, but right there in the moment it was just shock. I think it's really difficult to appreciate the sheer scale of the atrocities until you actually go there yourself. And when you're confronted with a reality as harsh as that, all you really feel for a while is shock.\n\nAs much as it was not a pleasant experience, I think if you ever get the chance to do it, then you absolutely should do it. Not to sound dramatic, but I don't think I would be the same person I am today without that experience.",

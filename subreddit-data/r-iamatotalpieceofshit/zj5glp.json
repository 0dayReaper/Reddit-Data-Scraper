I say that because anyone who knows wtf they are doing knows that bullets are not just lasers that travel in perfectly straight lines and do not stop at the first thing they hit. \n\nEven if the dog was dangerous having the kids around changes the whole equation. Jesus what if one of the kids had in that moment gone for the dog to calm it. \n\nDamn dog was tiny too! Its not like he was going to get knocked down and have his throat ripped out.",

I thought he shot her and I was wondering if it was a graze and that\u2019s why it didn\u2019t immediately incapacitate. \n\nThat\u2019s much better that it was a ricochet, albeit they can still kill. Man the video looks like he flat out missed the dog and shot the kid.\n\nThanks for the information. Upvote!",

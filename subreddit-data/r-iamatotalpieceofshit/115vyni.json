But anytime anyone in the car spoke to them in English. They would either ignore it or give one word answers.\n\nMy other English speaking friends that were in the car at the time agreed it was super weird, later when we spoke.",

I wouldn't say French speakers are all like this but I hear a lot of comments about how French speaking people in Quebec were oppressed in the past and that English speakers should make an effort in learning the language.\n\nPersonnally, I praise inclusion and consider that if you're capable of speaking two languages and the other can't, it's a matter of courtesy to switch. But I kinda feel that sometimes, people just don't know English and are too embarrassed/proud to say that it's a matter of ignorance, so they make it political by saying it's English speakers fault.",

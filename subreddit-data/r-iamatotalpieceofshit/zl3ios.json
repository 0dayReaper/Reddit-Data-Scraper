I was honestly concerned, and though I took her accusations of trying to sleep with her personally at the time, because I tend to be very shy when it comes to anything regarding sex, Honestly, in hindsight, with the multitude of female friends of mine that have been attacked or close to it, I can absolutely understand. Were I to come across a similar situation now I would try to flag down other women to at least make whomever feel safe.

I had to drop a pin at my location cause it was some weird backroad away from the city. \n\nMy guy friend took me to the hospital, I got an ankle cast then went to the police station. The cop interviewing basically tried to say I stole the truck and crashed it myself because I was too wasted to identify what the guy looked like besides a white bald guy and of course he had \u201cfled the scene of the crash\u201d. I was like check the registration on the truck, if it\u2019s a bald white man that\u2019s the dude. \n\nApparently it was a fellow police officer\u2019s truck and he said it had been \u201cstolen\u201d even though he fit the description of the man who kidnapped me. They took his side and said it must have been a different guy, if I was \u201csure\u201d I wasn\u2019t the one who took the truck.

Many also pretend their on a call when they pass me aswell I think. \n\nIt can be very cold (I live in Alberta), so I wear a big puffy jacket with a big droopy hood. I can only imagine how suspicious that makes me look at night, walking with my hands in my pocket and head down lol. \n\nIn the end I don't feel offended or upset. I get why some women feel fear on the sidewalks at night. I know what risks they can face. Sometimes I feel like saying \"I'm not a creep, your good\"... Let's be honest, that just makes me sound so creepy lmao.",

Coming back from the bar in Edinburgh late one night, my friend and I saw an inebriated young woman sitting on the step of the Balmoral hotel.  Out of concern we asked her what she was doing out in the cold and she said she'd gotten separated from her friends.\n\nShe didn't know where they were, she was visiting from Ireland, and didn't know where they lived, and being 1998 she didn't have a phone on her.\n\nWe asked if she wanted us to call the police or get help from the doorman/reception of the hotel and she said no, she just wanted to get in doors and sleep it off.\n\nSo that's what happened.  We walked her just over a mile to my student flat, told her she could use the phone whenever she wanted to, made her a cup of tea, and showed her to one of the spare beds, making sure to tell her to lay on her side.  Then my friend and I went into the kitchen to make a late dinner and talk about Formula One.\n\nIn the morning I was woken by the sound of my badly hungover \"guest\" blundering around trying to find the way out (our front door looked kind of like a part of the wall if you didn't know the place well) so I showed her out, directed her to the bus that would take her into town, and away she went.\n\nWe trusted her, she trusted us, it was all good - just people looking out for each other.",

Don't judge me saying this with out rewatching.\n\nIt is bad that his expectations were sex, but she didn't make it clear that, that wasn't what she wanted. The guy clearly liked her and her responce could pass as someone who's just coy.\n\nHe clearly had broken English and is from another culture. Once told that she doesn't want sex, he apologises and makes it clear he is not a threat",

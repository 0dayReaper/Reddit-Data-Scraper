Suburban, white America refused to believe that groups of cops were beating people to death until a video popped up of Rodney King being beaten by 4 police. In 1992, it was news that this was going on and people were glued to their tvs for days. Now, it's a weekly story that police are abusing their power. \n\nThere are still people people with the \"Back the Blue\" sticker that believe the excessive force is justified, that it is such a small group of police breaking the law that it is a non-issue, or they are just willfully uniformed. I don't know how anyone could be in support of police in 2023. It's tragic that the only course of action people have are film and hope the footage doesn't \"disappear.\"",

Security companies will hire you just because you have a pulse, but no they actually really don't want guards who will throw people around or shoot people over nothing. Unlike the police, private security companies are actually liable for damage. A security guard throwing someone around is a huge liability and they will get fired on the spot\n\nI am honestly offended that you consider what we do a lesser form of what police do. I've never shot anyone's dog or planted drugs on any single moms lol. We are completely different.",

Some Correctional Departments aren't sworn, so they MIGHT be able to swing it there. But where a Correctional officer is required to be POST certified and sworn in, they would unlikely pass the entry interviews.\n\nAny LEO like this should lose their job, be shamed from the industry entirely, and should be bared from holding any permits or certificates that allow them to perform security, or Law Enforcement work. On TOP of going to jail/prison for the appropriate crime.\n\nI fucking hate dirty cops.",

The laws are written in such a way that having that much cash with the drugs makes the drug charge worse. \n\nIf the same person is caught with 20 grand of gold around their neck or diamonds in their mouth, and a pound of weed, their charges are actually much different, because the law is written around something like \"substantial amounts of money.\"\n\nMuch similar to how IIRC a person could catch an aggravated charge if they have a pound of weed with a legally owned handgun.  Just the way the law is written.\n\nAlso.\n\nAs an officer thats willing to steal,which is still a criminal, wouldn't it be more reasonable to take cash? Wouldn't it be weird if a cop-looking fella came into your shop with a chain you just sold?",

The only thing we did wrong was plates were expired. We were pulled over on a Saturday and were planning on fixing tags Monday. Yeah we shouldn't have been driving but needed the money. We never did get his meds back. Non narcotic but controlled substance. Only reason we got the cash back was we figured out we had to post bond on it. \n\nThe system is broken. We aren't drug dealers. We're blue collar which is apparently the same thing to cops",

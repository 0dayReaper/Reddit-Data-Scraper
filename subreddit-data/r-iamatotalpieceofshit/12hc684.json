I know easier said than done, but I try really hard to stay as positive as I can. I went to school and graduated college.

My wife and I got married at 20 and had a 2 kids right away, so I\u2019ve been living the dad life for over a decade and sometimes I feel the kids at work got way more in common with my 12 year old than with me. Not in a bad way, but I couldn\u2019t go out and hang with them outside of work, let alone go on a date or be in a relationship with a teenager. Old dudes who wanna bang 18 year olds are just something I\u2019ll never get. If anything, I\u2019m looking forward to my wife and I getting old\u201der\u201d together.",

                            "comment": "Colombian here. I will be happy to provide some context. The current president of Colombia Gustavo Petro (a communist) has embraced a philosophy of \"negotiating\" with criminals. The man has managed to brainwash the entire younger population with ideals such as free education and opportunities. He has essentially proposed to negotiate with drug traffickers and has suggested paying people like the one in the video as a way to   incentivize them to stop being criminals. Naturally a bunch of younger people have fallen for his idiotic plans and now Colombia is going backwards because it's now ridden with criminals. Sadly, the only victims of this are the good civilians that 1. Can't defend themselves because the legal system essentially protects people like the one in the video 2. Many forms of non lethal weapons are criminalized. \n\nPetro continues moving Colombia with the same rhetoric of being a \"victim\" of the US and other powers (he said so at the UN speech), repeating the same Marxist views and selling \"life\" as his motto while he has been spending money buying many things considered to be luxurious. His kid I think is also involved in some sort of controversy. All in all, Colombia suffers a similar problem to the one Americans suffer with mass killings. A society victim to stupid ideologies that take hold of the collective pysche rendering them uncapable to defend themselves. In Colombia because the average Colombian can't buy guns to protect themselves, in America because there are too many guns out there.\n\nThere lies the contrast of the two sides of the coin.",

The police do sweeps every so often of the pan handlers and they also go through his house looking for drugs and other related items. They end up letting them all go because they pay the fines or do whatever they need to to be free, but they continue doing their thing.\nToday the ring leader was actually out next to the freeway entrance literally shoving his veteran sign in front of all the drivers and giving us all dirty looks if we didn\u2019t give him anything.\nI\u2019d have a lot more sympathy for the people who are pan handlers in my area if I didn\u2019t know about all of the history behind them.\nI know there are people who are legitimately suffering and they do this because they don\u2019t know what else to do, but the people I\u2019m talking about have a lot more money than I do.

I just knew something wasn't right with me. I struggled through my 20s because I didn't know who I was and I constantly blew up relationships because I got overly attached And was hurt that they didn't reciprocate which led to other issues. It reached a tipping point the year my mom died and I tried to commit suicide multiple times and got multiple psych holds. I was diagnosed with PTSD and depression rather than BPD from those and I was in and out of therapy for the next year but I never really felt like they were helping. Then, when I got pregnant and decided to carry to term, I knew i needed to take it more serious so I could be a better mom than I had, so, I started seriously going in 2014,  but I didn't get the BPD diagnosis until 2017 after 2 years of talking to the same therapist and being treated for PTSD using neurofeedback and cognitive behavioral therapy but still having severe issues. After the BPD doagnosis,  I started DBT and continued that for 2 years until I no longer met the criteria for BPD, and then kind of like a maintenance talk therapy check in type deal until 2021 when I was also diagnosed with ADHD. \n\n\nI'd recommend you read the criteria for BPD, read some articles on it, and consult with a therapist if you truly feel it resonates with you and has a negative impact on your life.",

Unfortunately, at the time (mid 90s), they weren't treated very well. \n\nJapan is often viewed with rose colored glasses, but wealth inequality, corporate culture, hyper capitalism and a lot of other factors has resulted in a fairly large and ignored problem with homelessness and poverty. People often don't realise how widespread Japanese slums are as  it is (was) actively ignored by the media and government at large. Even worse, once you are there at the bottom and homeless, there is little to no hope of ever moving back up due to cultural pressures and shame associated with poverty.\n\nI remember walking through the city streets and back alleys and there being people just sat or laying down everywhere, doing absolutely, all of them homeless. In some areas, you nearly couldn't access the back areas as entire communities of homeless people basically set up their own mini societies complete with stalls for commerce and their own security force. It was fucking surreal, but it was in those areas where I met some of the most genuine people I have ever known and had some of the best food I've ever eaten. It was in those areas where I had some of the most wild experiences of my life and largely that shaped who I am today.",

I drive way too many miles for a lease to be realistic but he would not let it go.

I really wish I would have been home because a) she didn't buy the fucking thing and b) I would have told him exactly why he could shove his fucking buy local attitude right up his ass.\n\nThe fact that he even had the balls to say shit to her made it so I will never buy from that dealership.",

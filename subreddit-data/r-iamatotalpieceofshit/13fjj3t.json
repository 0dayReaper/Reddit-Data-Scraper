He got his buddy (or his buddy\u2019s helicopter) and flew over the site to pick up the scraps and wreckage before the FAA got there to investigate it.\n\nThat\u2019s from what I remember.\n\nMakes me wonder if he would\u2019ve been okay had he applied for some type of permit to crash the plane at a safe location.",

Had the air currents been favorable, the plane could have glided over a neighborhood before crashing.\n\nNo, the problem is not that the guy \u201cdidn\u2019t get permission.\u201d There is no permission to be had. You cannot yeet yourself out of a plane and let it fall where it may, there\u2019s no agency that permits that.\n\nNo, movie studios do not crash planes. They destroy them on the ground. They slide models down wires. They suspend them under helicopters with safety personnel on standby in thoroughly-inspected and cleared areas. But no studio has ever intentionally put a plane into the dirt uncontrolled. EVER.\n\nNo, it doesn\u2019t matter if the plane belonged to him. You can\u2019t operate a plane in a reckless and negligent manner any more than you can do so with your car. Once your plane operates above 400 feet, you are in public airspace and must abide by federal law, including 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 32 (a):\n\n(a) Whoever willfully\u2014\n\n(1) sets fire to, damages, destroys, disables, or wrecks any aircraft in the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States or any civil aircraft used, operated, or employed in interstate, overseas, or foreign air commerce;\n\n(2) places or causes to be placed a destructive device or substance in, upon, or in proximity to, or otherwise makes or causes to be made unworkable or unusable or hazardous to work or use, any such aircraft, or any part or other materials used or intended to be used in connection with the operation of such aircraft, if such placing or causing to be placed or such making or causing to be made is likely to endanger the safety of any such aircraft;\n\n(3) sets fire to, damages, destroys, or disables any air navigation facility, or interferes by force or violence with the operation of such facility, if such fire, damaging, destroying, disabling, or interfering is likely to endanger the safety of any such aircraft in flight;\n\n(4) with the intent to damage, destroy, or disable any such aircraft, sets fire to, damages, destroys, or disables or places a destructive device or substance in, upon, or in proximity to, any appliance or structure, ramp, landing area, property, machine, or apparatus, or any facility or other material used, or intended to be used, in connection with the operation, maintenance, loading, unloading or storage of any such aircraft or any cargo carried or intended to be carried on any such aircraft;\n\n(5) interferes with or disables, with intent to endanger the safety of any person or with a reckless disregard for the safety of human life, anyone engaged in the authorized operation of such aircraft or any air navigation facility aiding in the navigation of any such aircraft;\n\n(6) performs an act of violence against or incapacitates any individual on any such aircraft, if such act of violence or incapacitation is likely to endanger the safety of such aircraft;\n\n(7) communicates information, knowing the information to be false and under circumstances in which such information may reasonably be believed, thereby endangering the safety of any such aircraft in flight; or\n\n(8) attempts or conspires to do anything prohibited under paragraphs (1) through (7) of this subsection;\n\nshall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years or both.\n\nHe violated both paragraphs (1) and (7) of this subsection, for which he could have received a maximum of 20 years if tried, but will get less by pleading to a lesser charge.\n\nIt is not okay that he crashed his own plane. It doesn\u2019t matter that no one was injured or killed. He acted with reckless disregard and as such what he did was illegal.\n\nNow stop being obtuse, you clowns.",

Planes don't just nosedive when the pilot leaves, they are built specifically to be very stable once in air. An updraft current could have given it some extra lift and it would have carried out past the park (which is not deserted) and into a populated area. It could have started a wildfire, taken out power lines, polluted water from leaking fluids, or collided with another plane or vehicle. It was careless and he's damn lucky no one got hurt.",

First, i will say i agree that the tipping industry should not exist and that they should just pay their employees so they can live on an expectable income.\n As for the amount tipped, I used to work for tips, so I feel pretty passionate about this. It should be based on effort/time/ hassle. Some people would stay there for hours and barely order, so they would tip next to nothing, vs. others who just happened to order an expensive bottle of wine were expected to pay based on the high total. It was a frustrating system, to say the least.\nIMO, for any standard delivery, I do a standard $4-5 (barring a holiday or horrendous weather, in which case goes up). For grocery deliveries that take way more effort, I tip $7-12 depending on the size of the order. \nI have had plenty of screwups with my food, but for the most part, it's been stapled and delivered in a reasonable time. Door dash always credits me for missing stuff, which obviously doesn't solve the hungry problem, and then you're still paying all the fees, but it's still nice to know I will at least get refunded.",

So I do think it's getting a little overblown. It doesn't seem like Amazon is using it as a loophole to hand out footage whenever they want.\n\ne: I realize this makes it sound like warrants aren't open to abuse. They definitely are, but that's not on amazon. All they have control over is the \"emergency response\" part.",

But please don't be dramatic lmao. The residual smell of cigarettes on an item is not dangerous. Otherwise, I'd have been considered a health risk to all my other classmates while growing up. My ma smoked, which meant I perpetually smelled. Nobody cared about how my clothes smelled, no parent tried to keep their asthmatic kid away from me because of the way I smelled, it was just \"oh, you can tell that kid has a smoker for a parent\"\n\nI'm only 24, hate the smell of cigarettes, yet I can't stand this new culture of \"anything that has any residual smoke smell means that whoever was in contact with said item is a gross disgusting person. And the way they *smell* is dangerous too\". It's not that deep lmao",

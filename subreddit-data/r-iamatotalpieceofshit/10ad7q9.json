You\u2019d be forgiven for not taking the time to ask if it was a toy first before shooting back. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes",

On a regulated field these guns are forced to be calibrated to shoot at around 350 FPS or below. regardless, shooting a gun like this in public, at a person with no protection is very likely to lose an eye, tooth or worse.",

I shut the door when the rest hit it, they made fair little dents. When he reloaded I ran out and threw the gun into the woods. Real fear came across my face as he fumbled to reload it, luckily this kid was like 11, and I was 17 at the time. Still insane people don\u2019t teach their kids to not shoot these type of toy guns at people without consent/ protection. Legit can hurt you badly.",

Same way you will be convicted of manufacturing an illegal firearm, when sawing off a shotgun.Also, there is a wider consensus, that transporting is not limited to crossing state borders but in fact refers to any kind of transport to and from different private properties. A lot of people transport their Airsoft guns with an orange tip to a airsoft field, removing them on site.",

Take a real handgun, dip the tip in paint. Walk the streets. If a cop approaches you and asks about it, tell him it has an orange tip, see? When the cop looks at the barrel, hes literally lining himself up for a headshot. Im just saying it isnt a sound idea at all. The only way it works is if said weapon isnt being held.",

He\u2019s using what\u2019s called a C-grip or a clamp grip. It was popularized in 3 gun competition shooting as a fast way to acquire targets and steady your rifle while on the move. In 3 gun you run a course with targets set up at various ranges and behind different cover for the best time. If you miss a target or shoot them out of order (depending on the competition rules) you add time to your score which means you don\u2019t do as well. You move around a lot and a traditional hold can hamper some of the movements required for the best speed.",

I've been in situations where I was this guy and didn't even attempt to fight back.  just stood there and took it.  literally had to go on a walk 1 day to avoid hitting back and giving an ex an excuse to call the cops and claim domestic violence.  then she proceeded to literally follow me down the road in a car.  I had to cut thru multiple ppl yards and thru different blocks to finally get away from her.\n\n\never since that relationship ended, I will tell someone I'm in a relationship that I follow a strict rule on getting hit.  my rule is that they have 3 swings to do their damage to me.  first swing I'll shrug it off.  second swing I'll be annoyed, but won't hit them back.  after that third swing on me, all bets are off.",

I just rarely see if anyone ever comments back unless I ask a question\n\nAlso people like this either have zero friends or never known what a friendship is to begin with so are miserable and do not know how to express themselves so bring everyone down to their level.

The door was wide open, and I yelled for help, but no one came out. Finally got away, went home and called Animal Services, but they were nowhere to be found. And the door was closed. I believe it was done on purpose. Yeah. Not all big dogs will attack, but when one does, it'll be enough.",

I spent some time on a farm with two big doggies who cuddled me when I was reading on the porch. My ex at 16 had a dog that was very happy and protective so I felt safe going on walks with him, but I never actively interacted with him, fearing he'd snap. Step forward. My best friend's huskies are menaces so I was still not a fan of being jumped and barked at, but I was more comfortable around 18. Other friends have barky small rats that I never meshed with, since they were very aggressive towards me. Step back. At 21 I visited my boyfriend with two big cuddlebugs and I actually started liking them. Now I'm babysitting a mid sized dog and I love it. I'm still not comfortable around aggressive/protective breeds but I can stand them \n\nIt takes years to get over dog attacks.",

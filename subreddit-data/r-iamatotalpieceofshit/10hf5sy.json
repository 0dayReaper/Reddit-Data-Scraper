I told her our policy, which was if you take it home, it is no longer our responsibility to keep it alive, and im sorry they didnt work out for you. She argued that she just purchased them a couple days ago and they died before she planted them.  \"Well, ma'am, the barcode here on the pots says it was last fall that you purchased them.\" She said she didnt have the original pots and used what she had lying around. \"You didnt have the pots from a couple days ago, when you didnt get to plant them before taking them out of the pots?\" .......not to mention it was dead stick root balls with no dirt in the pots......and mums are ONLY sold in the fall...it was mid summer the next year. \n\nYou cant fix stupid.",

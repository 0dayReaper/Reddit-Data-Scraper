They do no necessarily transport you if there are no indication for you needing further medical attention.\n\nExample: you have chest pains and call the ambulance. Ambulance comes, get you an 12 point ekg and there are no inregulatities. They look into it and find out that your chest paints are from a blunt hit to the chest you got the other day. So, you do not need to go to the hospital, it would suffice to go to your GP the next day. Usually they describe it to you and you can of course still go to the hospital, but you will have to wait a long time because you are not in a critical condition",

If they\u2019re worried enough to call an Ambulance and potentially be on the hook for several hundred if not thousand dollar ride then you\u2019d think they\u2019d try every other option left available to them. And maybe they did, I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s disingenuous to say it\u2019s either an Ambulance or you drive yourself. If those were the only two options a lot of people who be dying at home.",

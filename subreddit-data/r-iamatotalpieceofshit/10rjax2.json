The moment you use anything other than your fists, and ESPECIALLY something that can stab a person who is more than likely incapacitated if not already at death's door, there is borderline 0 chance there was only intent of physical harm, or they would have stopped at the car. The moment you actively push beyond reasonable limitations of survival, you are actively causing another person to die. Whether or not you meant to stop within an inch of their life or not, you put their life, with full intent, to the brink. There is no accident or question of doubt that the amount done here had a high likelihood of causing death, and that would either classify as attempted or successful murder",

If he had killed the person with their car then maybe you have a case for it... but there is a whole category of homicide dedicated to in the moment killings, its called 2nd degree murder. The defence will claim that he didn't mean to kill the person and that the defendant 'lost control', but they stabbed them with a deadly weapon after already hitting them with their car, and that will always qualify as intentional.",

I know it's hard to believe, but many drivers are one bad moment away from entering into a manic road rage incident. Some people are on edge, and having any little incident inconvenience their moment of calm within their metal box is enough to set them off. These unprovoked incidents happen.",

The law states they are allowed to use those road.  However, they are supposed to abide by laws too and often they don\u2019t by riding side by side.  Cops try to ticket them, but many of them are doctors and lawyers and just skirt the law.  Causing traffic jams and just generally kissing people off.  The cities and the state have failed to upgrade the roads to better account for increased bicycle traffic.  This is no surprise to me.  I\u2019m surprised it doesn\u2019t happen more often actually.",

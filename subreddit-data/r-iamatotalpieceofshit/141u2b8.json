While that might play some part, there's generally other factors at play. \n\nOn my dad's dairy farm for instance, it was not uncommon at all for a calf to be rejected by the mother. It didn't happen consistently but it was frequent enough over the years we could recognize the signs and try to save the calf. Of particular note, I remember once a cow had twins, and she only rejected one of them. These were animals living comfortable, pretty stress free lives and they would still sometimes abandon their babies for some incomprehensible reason.",

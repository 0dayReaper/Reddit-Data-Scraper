Average American in 2022 earned $4500 monthly, so that would be a fine of roughly $104-$540.\n\nOf course, both the Egyptian and American would have made less in 2013 so those percentages would be higher, but I don't have 2013 figures handy. Inflation means USD in 2013 was worth about 28% more than 2022, so rough back-of-the-napkin math would say the fines should be scaled up by 28%. So roughly $133-691 today.",

Steve Martin  and the Bangles have banded together and formed an organization dedicated to freeing international prisoners from this inhumane practice. Even with years of therapy, some former prisoners are only able to walk like an orangutan, with their arms in the air, like they just don't care, but they really do. Please consider contributing to this worthy cause.",

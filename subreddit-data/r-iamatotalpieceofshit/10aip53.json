John Doe Warrants are not valid in every state in the US. Additionally, the federal government does not allow nor recognize this type of warrant. A few states allow John Doe Warrants due to the fact that the warrant still provides a sufficient description of a suspect in a crime. \n\nI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re valid in California. \nAre warrants public record? Tbh if the warrant had his name on it, I feel the news/police would be sharing the name with public",

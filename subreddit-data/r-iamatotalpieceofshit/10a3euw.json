Seems odd to go after the rarest (by far) type of firearm used.\n\nIn 2018 13,958 people were murdered by firearm (all types of firearms) by comparison 10,845 people were killed in ford pickup trucks (one BRAND of one TYPE of vehicle) in 2018.\n\nAs far as the police response in Uvalde it was utterly disgusting and every officer involved should be intensly investigated and unless they were under clear and direct orders from a superior they should be fired and the upper management should be not only be fired criminally charged.\n\nI do not believe this is or will be a normal response by law enforcement. That being said, put yourself in an officers shoes these days. Everything they do is racist, sexist, and picking on the poor, all while they are being targeted and executed just for wearing the uniform.\n\nI think one would also assume that the regular or constant presence of law enforcement would deture these wackos far better than waiting to call them after the massacre has started. (Make it a hard target not a soft target)\n\nI think everyone needs to learn to think for thier self, do a few minutes of research, objectively read it from  the opposite sides source and maybe begin to realize that pretty much every source is one sided and leaves out or misleads some details.",

If we are talking gun violence in general, easily more good guys having guns because nobody else well stop bad guys with guns and I don't see any argument better than that.

Although it would be impossible to abolish the police in modern times, forms of radical reform is needed, such as demilitarizing police departments who get handed out surplus equipment like it's candy or requiring better de-escalation training. Or helping police realise that they're gonna have to accept that they might get hurt or lose an officer in order to stop an active shooter. \n\nIf I recall correctly the police at Uvalde waited for a swat team outside while the shooter was going to town. Why not go in and stop them? Sure you can't just go in guns ablazing or without a plan but these guys did absolutely nothing aside from barring other people who wanted to do something and save their own children. How come someone who isn't even armed is more willing to put their lives down more than the person who is literally trained to? Why are police more capable of shooting a black kid (such as Tamir Rice)or people on their own porches (With paint during the Minneapolis protests) than they are taking down an actual threat?",

But when you think of the context of the present situation where gun violence is getting out of control, anyone who loves their fellow human and has \u201ccommon sense\u201d based on that will want to achieve the same thing - the preservation of life. \n\nRestricting access to guns to adults with a stable mind is literally the least that can be done from a common sense perspective. That literally I believe is common sense to all.",

    "postText": "Hey IAATPOS! It's been a minute since we've had a chat! Hope y'all are doing well.\n\nIf you haven't heard, reddit has proposed to monetize access to the API. There's more info here, it's better you hear it from them as my dumbass will butcher explaining it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/140pqxs/dont\\_let\\_reddit\\_kill\\_3rd\\_party\\_apps/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/140pqxs/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/)\n\nWhat I wanted to talk about was the black out a lot of subs are proposing, though. (making it so you can't access the subs in retaliation). IAATPOS isn't going to do that and I want to explain why.\n\nIn all honesty we'd just be doing reddit a favour closing the sub temporarily lol. The amount of time admins spend in our queues, as well as the frivolous and legitimate reports they get- like copyright claims to try and have posts pulled down that goes to their I'd imagine expensive legal team, is very high. We as sub mods invest a lot of time to prevent this sub being banned, it doesn't make sense to think voluntarily banning ourselves temporarily would come across as anything but good news to the site.\n\nOn the flip side.. it's like.. What are we going to just let all these corrupt corporations of the world spill tons of chemicals and destroy cities with no coverage? Are we going to let gross abuse of power that leads to death in a lot of times just go right under the radar? We're going to let some politician sexualizing minors on their twitter get a pass? Really? I don't want to do that. Would you want to do that? I'd imagine not since you're subbed here.\n\nSo.. We're not going to do it. If you guys disagree, we're not supreme dictators or something and we can figure it out together, but I don't think this is the play for this sub.\n\nThanks for hearing us out, it's kind of a tricky topic but I want to be open with y'all since it will be obvious that we're not a part of it soon.",

It was proposed by r/blind. It\u2019s about equity and access. And it\u2019s only for what? 48 hours? This sub isn\u2019t the Washington Post or the New York Times. People doing bad shit will still get called out, and the stuff that wouldn\u2019t make it into mainstream media can wait until the 14th to be posted. \n\nThe reasons *you* cited may make sense, but with the real reason for the blackout being something else, it think it would be kind of a total piece of shit move to be like \u201coh, well that doesn\u2019t affect me personally\u201d and ignoring it.",

But let\u2019s not pretend this sub is the last bastion of decency without which these things would go totally unnoticed. A lot of stuff on the sub is links to news outlets, who are *already covering it*. This sub just gets those stories in front of some more people. \n\nJoin the blackout or don\u2019t, I just don\u2019t think the reasons you cited are particularly compelling in the face of so many people having their access cut off from Reddit due to the app\u2019s total apathy towards those with disabilities.",

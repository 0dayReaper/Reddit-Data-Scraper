And the thing she yelled out about not trying hard enough being her first response to being called out for the lie showed him (and me) that she had no remorse for carrying this lie for 25 years. The thing is we don\u2019t *have* to accept people\u2019s apologies. We don\u2019t. If we aren\u2019t ready or even simply just don\u2019t want to right then.  BUT in my experience, getting to the point where you can forgive, with or without telling the other person, is great for you. You don\u2019t owe that person an \u201cI forgive you\u201d. But it truly helps you release anger, resentment and probably a lot more things. \n\nImo she is still super salty about their *assumed* divorce and wanted to hurt him. Probably never got laid a day in her life after that lol.",

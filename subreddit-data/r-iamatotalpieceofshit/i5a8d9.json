Aggravated assault is causing or attempting to cause serious bodily injury to someone. Think stabbing or shooting someone. Simple assault is causing or attempting to cause bodily injury. Think punching someone and breaking their nose. Then there is harassment which is striking or subjecting someone to unwanted physical contact. Injury is not a component of harassment. In this case a slap really falls under harassment as you\u2019re lacking probable cause to prove bodily injury.",

As a kid, I had 3 extra doses of the polio vaccine, and 2 extra doses of another vaccine (I believe it was the DTP/DTaP), because the nurse mixed up me and my brother. I hated getting shots, but my brother didn't really mind them (he was always bribed after with McDonald's) so he took my shots and I took the oral doses that he was supposed to have. When they figured it out, we had to start the correct series of vaccinations over. Our names start with the same letter, and there's 4 of us kids, so my mom normally had her hands full taking us to the doctor for vaccinations before the school year started. She worked at the clinic where our pediatrician was, so she'd bring us in to work with her and then drop us off during her lunch break. After my brother and I pulled our stunt, my mom started taking me and my youngest brother (a baby at the time) in the mornings, and then the middle two kids got switched out at her lunch time.",

People are clearly dying of random crap at a higher rate, especially in sports, than in any years prior to the covid jab (covid in general really), or at least are seeming to, and quite a few official numbers back this up.\n\nNoe, anti valuers are giving a, seemingly, viable reason for this. Untested jabs. Not helped by the likes of Pfizer jabs having been listed as a cause of death in at least one country, plus the fact they've repeatedly petitioned to make themselves unsuable for the covid jab in multiple countries.\n\nThe counter argument to the jab causing it is.... to say the jab isn't causing it... with no actual yknow, evidence of what else it could be.\n\nOr to just.... pretend it isn't happening.\n\nPersonally I believe its covid itself causing much of these issues (one of the only alternatives given to the jab causing them)\n\nBut when counter arguments are basically only going 'no u dum'... People are going to believe the side giving a 'plausable' argument... even if that argument is not well thought.",

We can memory hole saying/hearing that but I heard it everywhere (e.g. NIH, WHO, Fauci, CNN, CDC...).  I told that to my friends/family to convince them to get it.  I think we all know that's not accurate.  The NIH even released a study in July of '21 on the Delta variant claiming it saw a some benefits but the difference in rate of transmission amongst either group was not significant.\n\nI think we've all been wrong about a lot regarding this so I can understand people being skeptical.

It stops spread primarily through lessening the severity, thereby the time someone is infected.   \n\n\nIt also SIGNIFICANTLY reduces severity. Basically, like every other vaccine for respiratory viruses we've ever had.  \n\n\nAnd literally no one ever said it would eliminate COVID completely.",

You may have just missed the many examples where one could infer a strong suggestion that only in the rarest of cases does the virus \"breakthrough.\"\n\n\"When you get vaccinated...[prevent] the spread of the virus. You become a dead end to the virus.\" -Fauci on Face the Nation May '21\n\nThere are MANY experts that said something very similar.\n\nEven the term \"breakthrough\" was used to imply how rarely it occurs.\n\nYou can revise history all you want but it was strongly implied for months that getting vaccinated was extremely efficacious regarding the prevention of transmission.\n\nI think you know that few people implied or inferred it was completely guaranteed nor is the general population assuming that.  The implication was that it was extremely effective and that is not true.\n\n&gt;we had to work together for it to work\n\nYou're operating under the delusion that 100% behavioral adoption would've \"worked\" (what does \"work\" even mean here?).\n\nThere are plenty of countries that are at 99+% vaccination and the virus still spreads.\n\nThere was never a road - after jan 2020 - where this didn't become an ubiquitous part of our lives.",

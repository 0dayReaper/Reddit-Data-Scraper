I didn\u2019t wanna fight so I just called my dad so I could at least have somebody to talk to just in case but the guy came creeping around the corner again and you could tell by his face he was up to no good so i pulled the dumbest card and reached for my belt (I didn\u2019t have a gun but I could at least pretend to) and said \u201chold up if this guy tries something he\u2019s dead\u201d as loud as I could without yelling and he walked off.

But by the 1970s, most states had switched over to customers pumping their own gas. As these changes swept the U.S., a state ban on self-service in 1949, known as the Retail Gasoline Dispensing Safety Act, stopped the Garden State from following suit. Oregon passed its own similar law in 1951.\n\nIn the original bill, the New Jersey state legislature cited safety concerns and rising costs to consumers as reasons to not transition over to self-service. But every time there's a spike in gas prices, bills opposing full service start to pop up. Seen as a 'political third rail' by many politicians including Gov. Phil Murphy, it's one of the few legislative debates that doesn't follow party lines. Every bill has failed so far, but it hasn't stopped self-serve advocacy groups and politicians from pushing for change.",

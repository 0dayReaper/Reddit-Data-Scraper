The UK has the same problem, most of the racism towards immigrants seems to stem from the rural areas where for the most part there... aren't any immigrants.\n\nWhen any people live in a homogenous society and people of different cultures are easily identifiable as \"different\" or \"outsiders\" it's much easier to blame them for all lifes ills without further examination, because as stupid pack animals we're spooked by ANYTHING that seems remotely unfamiliar to ourselves and our own experience. As reflected by the media owned by... you see where this is going.\n\nThe fear and the media amplification creates an imaginary spectre of an enemy, an Us vs Them to latch on to, and this allows everyone to vastly simplify their thinking, make hundreds of unfounded assumptions about how people live and think and react based on like a 10 second exposure to some random dice roll aspect of their complex multifaceted culture (y'know, just the same way theirs is) and feel just fine about hating \"Them\". Because for the most part it's always fiction that doesn't exist.\n\nAnyone that's lived in a multicultural city quickly masters seeing through this bullshit and moves on to identifying actual friend from foe based on the situation and trying not to let racial bias get in the way, cause some cities are still fucking sketchy.\n\nPoint is, it all comes down to experience, the people you meet form the person you are. You cannot judge any culture on all the stereotypes of that culture or even on the one person you meet from that culture, that's a ludicrous way to live. As soon as you spend appreciable time around anyone different usually quite quickly people find common ground and you start to think of one of Them as one of Us, as a person, and your biases start to break down and are diluted by your positive experience and the new knowledge you share as you get to know someone.\n\nLiterally all it takes is for someone to make the conscious choice to think \"why do I think X about Y?\" and come to the correct conclusion which is that they don't really know, they just don't like it, so it's a pretty irrational way to think about the thing, and might even inspire them to really look at daily culture somewhere else and try to see how it makes sense for them, and stop being so afraid.\n\nBut, that's just FUKKEN CRAZY LIBRAL UTOPIA SHIT, amirite?",

Just wearing a turban in some areas is an invitation to be harassed. Many Sikhs were attacked and killed after 9/11, for example.  Growing up during that time, as an Indian kid, in a very white, very ignorant area taught me well how hateful some people are.  I don't know how you change that.",

In modern times, they wear a necklace with a knife pendant on it that fulfills this requirement, though.",

The boss was still a boss, and given the way he carried himself, I do not believe he was highly religious. My 2 coworkers though taught me all about Sikhism and life in Punjab, and they were genuinely some of the kindest people I\u2019ve met. \n\nThe religion requires that members serve members of their community daily, and avoid immoral things, such as even working for companies in immoral industries, including gambling, tobacco, alcohol, etc. This was definitely reflected in their work at the sandwich shop, as they bent over backwards to do the best they could for customers who came in. They wanted to make sure their neighbors go home with a full and happy stomach every time they order a sandwich. \n\nI\u2019d say though, that how traditionally people practice the religion is highly varying from person to person, and definitely affects a lot how their lifestyle and way of being is aligned with the religion.",

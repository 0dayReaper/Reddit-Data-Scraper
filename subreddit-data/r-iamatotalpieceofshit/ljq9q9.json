Forget it if it's a mobile connection - unless you know some techie with access to triangulation through cell towers which is still not as mundane as looking something up on whois.\n\nI 100% believe they did it like it was claimed. Awful as channers can be, like Reddit they have a pretty diverse userbase and specialists in pretty much everything. And even if you don't have formal training on flight paths or constellation mapping, there's still someone nearby that will hop on their car and drive around honking to check if the horn can be heard on stream. All in all it was an impressive job requiring superb expertise in several fields of knowledge, and even more impressive, how to put that entirely dissimilar data together.\n\nInternet Historian has a great series on this feud between Shia and 4Chan.",

He even said \"I didn't get into your bank accounts due to legal reasons, but if I wanted to I very well could have\" \nOne thing he did was call my phone provider pretending to be me. Completely bluffed his way with the person and had access to that. From there was able to get in my email. from there my Social Media. \n\nEven without that, he found my profile, was able to see I had pizza one day. Some way some how he figured out what pizza store i used and then by some jedi magic got my address. \n\nPicture with your car is also damning. even if you have max private settings, some of your friends may not. \n\nThen he told me about a online community of perverts that steal photos of kids. fucking gross. \n\nI don't post what I am doing, pictures of my kids, I don't even have a profile photo of me. I essentially use it what it's for. To keep up with my friends. The friends that matter get my kids photo (my parents for example) \nI am also old, I find it easy not to care about SM clout chasing or social currency. I dont care to have a ton of followers or to be popular. That mindset is probably the mindset of setting yourself up to get easily stalked. \n\nHope this helped. \n\nIf you wanna know how I went about this, I deal with several Private Investigators. PIs are a mixed bag of skillsets but I found one office with ethical hackers, former cops, CI officers from the army, and I just found someone willing to do this for me.",

Which is seemed the second highest possibe in Japan according to that. \n\nPlus they were protected by laws for people 18 and under.  Not that it excuses what they did but it's not like they got probation.\n\nThere are miscarriages of Justice constantly. I don't see how that inherently makes the law misogynistic by them getting prison while being protected by the law as minors. Yes it's shitty, but not like the judge said \"if the victim had been a man we'd have given you life in prison instead\".",

You just also never know if either of them have a weapon that could be pulled out at any moment. You learn to just ignore or avoid these things. If you are really worried, you still ignore and get some distance before calling 911 to have them handle it. \n\nI'm not saying this is the correct way to act, but it's unfortunately what you have to do to avoid more conflict.

I agree that you have to be so careful in large cities like this, there are some insane people out there.\n\nBut also the right move is usually to call the non emergency line (and 911 or the equivalent if it is an emergency, obviously). \n\nI once did this for a guy who passed out on his back on the street in Vegas while watching a video on his phone. He didn\u2019t look homeless, he coughed and what looked like vomit flew up out of his mouth. I was afraid he could get his unlocked phone stolen or worse, may choke on his vomit- but no way I, as a female, would risk walking up to him. I looked up the non emergency line, explained everything and answered all of their questions, watched to see his lungs rising to make sure he was still alive. As I was doing this, I watched a couple walk by and take a photo of him laughing. Thankfully the people I called took me seriously and sent someone, I watched them go to him about five min or less later. Went home feeling like I did the right thing. If I hadn\u2019t of called, I would have been wondering if he was ok.\n\nSo you can still help while not getting directly involved.",

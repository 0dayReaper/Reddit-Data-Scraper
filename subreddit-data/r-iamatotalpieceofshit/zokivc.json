This is the far left map in the image above.\n\nWhen the British left in 1948, six Arab countries (Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia) invaded. After about a year of fighting, Israel controlled the Jewish portion of the UN partition plan and about 60% of the Arab portion.\n\nAt the end of 1948, compared with today's boundaries, the main differences were: Egypt controlled Gaza, Jordan controlled the West Bank, and Syria controlled the Golan Heights. This is the second map.\n\nIn 1967 there was another war, and Israeli captured more territory--the Sinai Penisula (and Gaza), the Golan Heights, and the West Bank. This is the third map.\n\nIsraeli gave back the Sinai Peninsula in 1979, but Egypt gave up its claim to Gaza, so it became unclaimed occupied territory (Palestinian).\n\nIn 1988, Jordan gave up its claims to the West Bank, so similarly that territory became unclaimed occupied territory (Palestinian).\n\nWhen I say \"unclaimed\" I mean no formally recognized country (Palestine is not a recognized country) claims ownership. Gaza and the West Bank have both been occupied by Israel since 1967, but Israel does not formally claim that territory (neither does any other recognized country)\n\nThe Golan Heights are still disputed between Israel and Syria. I believe the US is the only country to recognize Israel's claim (in 2019).\n\nThat brings us to the fourth map, which would still be accurate today, except that the West Bank is now full of settlements by Israelis. It is not just occupied by Israel, it is now being settled by Israeli citizens.",

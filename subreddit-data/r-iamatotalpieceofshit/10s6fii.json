Kawshigan claims Nora Tan damaged his \"stellar reputation\" and said she brought \"trauma, depression and impacts\" to his life. He also sought $22,000, or roughly $16,800 in U.S. dollars, in a since-dismissed suit claiming she \"breached an agreement\" to improve their relationship. \n\nA state court\u00a0struck down the smaller lawsuit\u00a0on Jan. 28, alleging that Kawshigan made \"manifestly groundless\" claims that were \"without foundation\" and took advantage of the court process in an effort to \"intentionally\u2026 vexing or oppressing the defendant,\" The Strait Times reported. \n\n\"This court will not be an accessory to [Kawshigan\u2019s] calculated attempt to compel engagement from the defendant who, after years of massaging the claimant\u2019s unhappiness, has finally decided to stand up to his threats rather than cower and give in to his demands,\" State Courts Deputy Registrar Lewis Tan wrote of the cases. \n\nBut a pre-trial hearing for the other lawsuit, where he's asking for $3 million in Singapore currency, remains set for Feb. 9.\u00a0",

If they went to dinner or she received gifts from the guy and accepted those things and then decides \"we're just friends\" after dating him, that's shitty to use a guy for free stuff. If you didn't see as a romantic partner to begin with then tell him first before doing those things with him. At the same time though, I think it's a little much to sue her over it.",

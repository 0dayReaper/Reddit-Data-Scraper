He is definitely miffed, but not angry. Three people are videoing him before the kick.\n\nIs this perhaps a contest or game situation and not a random guy coming to a park with 5 pizzas?\n\nEdit- Just looked at it frame by frame that is not a pizza at all. It looks like raw pizza dough to me. Maybe a desert pizza or cookie dough. \n\nThe sodas in the background are empty this could be left over boxes and trash. The guy could be taking it to the dumpster off screen. \n\nI just don\u2019t think this is random lady kicking 5 real pizza out of a random guys hand.\n\nEdit 2- Others have noticed camera angle is too perfect. Top 2 pizza boxes look open already. Bottom of boxes have grease,  dirt, and leaves on the bottom. Lad Bible has fake stuff in the past. \n\nI think the main evidence that this is not authentic is how he is running with 5 pizza boxes holding it with one hand. If it was really $100 of food, dinner for 10+ people I doubt he would handle it that way.",

Still a shitty thing to do but like Mike Tyson said \"we all do dumb shit when we're fucked up.\" But these bitches are coming in with at least some kind of rehearsed intentions with the girl in the white dress recording and ready to get the complete shot with the kick, the pizzas falling, pan to a shot of the guy's reaction, before finally panning over to the kicking shitbird who waits to make sure she's on camera before delivering her super funny and embarrassed 'crouch to the ground with hand over the mouth' reaction. Then it's giggles all around before I'm sure that video gets sent off to their TikTok with that fuckin' annoying female voiceover robot reading out a caption that says something like \"Kaela had one too many White Claws and karate kicked this man's pizzas. Oh no \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\" for their 215 followers to enjoy.",

So it's absolutely illegal for her to post it without permission, the family could get her in trouble for breaking data protection for not material damage (causing distress) not to mention slander.\n\nTaking photos of miners is fine though, they are always willing to pose for anything but it's difficult to get the lighting right down the mine.",

In the U.S. a few states have gotten with the times and have laws about child photography requiring parental permission (exceptions being public places I think). I think most of it applies to day care providers.  The question is whether the babysitter would fall into that category.\n\nThere are also laws regarding photo/video without consent.  In public, usually almost anything goes.  In a child's home though, there is an expectation of privacy.  The child cannot consent to being in the photo/video, and therefore it could potentially fall under those statues.\n\nI think most likely though this would fall under something like trespassing and/or right to privacy laws.  The woman was asked to leave, she did not.  The pay is a civil issue, the failure to leave when asked is a trespass issue.  Also, the child has privacy rights.  A lot of states have laws about photographing people in their homes without consent.  Since children cannot consent without a parent, a parent asking for a photo of a child taken in their own home to be removed may fall under those privacy laws.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: The actual practical answer though is this isn't going to escalate to a legal issue because you'd have to be truly batshit insane to let it go there.  Take the photo off, get paid.  Hope the parent doesn't sue you for putting a video up taken without their knowledge in their own home (violating many states' wiretapping laws), and insinuating they're a pedophile, then uploading that video to the public (defamation).",

So it's definitely illegal for a stranger to do it. And I imagine children can't consent, so that means a logical conclusion in my mind is that it goes to the parents, as people suspect. Of course, people are usually fine with someone else taking photos and videos in their house (usually they are friends and the context makes sense) so nobody thinks about this. But if the person said \"I don't want you recording and posting it online\" then I'm pretty sure you are literally not allowed to do so.",

If they  are actually inside your house, you are long past the \"probable cause\"/need a warrant phase. I also suspect there are special clauses that allow LEOs, in the performance of their duties, to continue operating their body cam. So *obviously* it's legal.\n\nWe can dig into it but it's my understanding that \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" does a lot of heavy lifting in regards to recording in private spaces (with regards to civilians). It's well known that one party consent exists for audio recordings, but this is not true for video. Video is more grey, though not explicitly illegal in all circumstances.",

Its very badly acted too, there's a lot of these videos just like the one where the electrician is trying to charge an old lady when she changed her mind about getting a quote for some work she needed and she was being bullied for a call out fee even though she cancelled the visit ahead of time. \n\nIt's outrage bait.\n\nIt's actually cringeworthy acting, there's a lot of these videos in the UK now, I'm not on Facebook anymore but there were so many of these it annoyed the hell out of me, well meaning people giving the pages clicks for money without realising.. Who even talks like that?",

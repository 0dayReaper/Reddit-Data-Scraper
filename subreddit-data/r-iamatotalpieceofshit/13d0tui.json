He said that in the subconscious mind of a child, they know on an instinctive level that their very survival depends upon their parents. The notion that their parents are capricious, mean, or mentally unstable is an insupportable notion to the child's subconscious. Because realizing that would mean the child would have consciousness that they are in mortal danger. \n\nNo child's mind can stand that level of fear, so they convince themselves they \"deserve\" the abuse, and if they can only be good children, the parent will be pleased and no longer punish them.",

And better equipped to handle life.\n\nAnd in a fucked up way, maybe it did. It made them better at surviving their dysfunctional family environment.\n\nHumans are terrifyingly adaptable.

It's flat out child abuse and exploitation by parents for profit. I think YouTube is doing something about this kind of stuff, like making sure that when the child is an adult, they have a percentage of all the revenue they were a part of their entire life.

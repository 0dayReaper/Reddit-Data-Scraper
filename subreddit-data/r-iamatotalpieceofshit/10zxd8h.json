But if you swing your arm back after impact, you can push into their face for some more force, if not a stronger initial hit. Imagine someone placing their hand against your face and then drawing it across like in a slap as hard as they can. No impact sting but still a good pushing around for your head.",

Granted, he\u2019d have to be damn precise, but for the purposes of this hypothetical he could in theory slip his hand in there.

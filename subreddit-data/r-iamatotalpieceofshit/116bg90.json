A decent news organization has three steps in the editing process: drafting, editing, and copy editing (smaller organizations will have the story go through the editor in chief before publication). Big sites think that going from 3 to 2 will have no measurable impact on article quality, but it ALWAYS does.",

Two the Asian guy is a completely despicable human being and three I wish someone would call the cops because that\u2019s clearly assault with damage to property. Let him go to jail but sadly the Mexican guy probably doesn\u2019t want the aggravation of city officials who\u2019d want permits and health inspections or they\u2019d give him thousands in fines too. Sad times we\u2019re living in where no one can just live and let live. If that\u2019s a business the food cart might actually give him some extra traffic where they both benefit. But nope he\u2019s not paying me rent so let me abuse and run him off what\u2019s likely not even my property aside from the responsibility of maintenance which clearly isn\u2019t being done.\nWhat a role model he\u2019s being for the younger kid who came out with him too, who really doesn\u2019t seem like he wants to be involved.",

Other Businesses like open air restaurant\u2019s tolerate street hawkers coming up to seated customers and trying to sell, them anything from imitation sun glass, Rolex watches to viagra. It\u2019s like a capitalist free market dream. The only time it gets regulated is when groups of people like taxi drivers or street beggars come together and create mafias. In the UK nearly everyone works for corporations often not even UK owned and they wonder why people are quiet quitting and not enthused by earning just enough money to pay for their rent, bills and food. It used to be people could afford to go out and get hammered every weekend to take them out of their monotony for just a few hours a week but it\u2019s too expensive to do that anymore and they effectively killed the nightlife scene in the UK. I feel sorry for young people who will never know that it was like the like Friday before Christmas now every single weekend in the UK back then.",

He said he had called in backup further down down the highway.

Told me to be careful and let me go. No ticket. Nothing.\n\nAs I was putting my jacket and helmet back on another patrol car arrived and he turned and said the other officer \"It's ok. He's alright. Everything is OK\" I left, slowly, before the other officer got too involved.\n\nThat old timers leniency and concern worked on me. I had given that old timer my word to behave and be safe.

Not satisfying as in \"Nice to see someone do that\". \nI also got the satisfying feeling, because although he isn't respecting any laws, he is demonstrating in this 1:30 clip some control of his car (even though apparently he crashed afterwards, its not included in this video).",

Maybe I was a product of my environment growing up in the San Jose with a lot of gangs in the 90\u2019s, and one having to always watch their colors (blue/red). Maybe I felt like I needed to bully someone instead of being a prey myself. It was a dog eat dog world. At the end, we all grow up and grow out of it.  We take those lessons and learn from them. I am a college grad now from SJSU (class of 06) and I have my own parcel delivery business servicing the Bay Area and Sacramento region.\n\nWe all change and transform for the better with maturity and experiences.\n\nI hope this guy in the video one day realizes that he fucked up and a cheap shot on another man is inexcusable.",

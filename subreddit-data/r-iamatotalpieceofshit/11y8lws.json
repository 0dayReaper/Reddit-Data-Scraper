That first hit, the one you said would initiate the fight, could easily be the one that ends it. The first surprise hit to the jaw could knock you out immediately.\n\nI'd say if you didn't do that they're doing (ignoring him) then taking a defensive pose and striking first when the situation clearly escalated from his side would be the route I'd take. The guy is unhinged, and I think the police/law would be on your side if there was imminent threat of danger to you and your family in a confined space with a bunch of people that are unlikely to interfere.

Most people have never gotten in a fight before and their first instinct isn\u2019t to fight, at least it isn\u2019t for me. I would have probably froze and done what the dad did.\n\nI feel sorry the family had to experience it especially the kid. The dad is probably killing himself running this scenario in his head on what he should of done. The mom is also super scared but showed a lot of strength during the interaction. She was having her baby count with her and then also carried him as soon as the aggressor got louder. \n\nNow seeing this scenario happening, I can plan my actions in case this ever happened to me and my family. I would tell my wife to take the kid and go to the back of the train. I would stand up go between my family and the aggressor. My wife would then take the baby and go behind me to the back of the train. If the guy follows her then I\u2019ll block him. \n\nWhat would you do if this happened to you and your family?",

During soviet times, Russia had a habit of mass immigrating Russians into Eastern bloc countries and making the native population second-class. Russians got preferential treatment and they banned non-russian languages in some cases. Most Eastern bloc countries have a particular disdain for Russians because of this. I have family in Estonia and they cannot stand Russian people, they view them as foreign invaders. It's not quite the same as your typical \"anti- other\" racism.",

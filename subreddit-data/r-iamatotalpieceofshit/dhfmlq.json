This guy\u2019s friend didn\u2019t own all 2 thousand pigeons. He actually raises pigeons as babies and trains them to race back to this loft. \n\nPigeon fancier\u2019s/racers from all over the country or the world send this guy baby pigeons from their best breeding stock. And then this individual raises them till race day.\ufffc He starts out flying them 25 miles away for a couple weeks and 50 miles away for a couple weeks and then 100 miles away, etc. etc. (I don\u2019t know the exact distance is but something like that). He posts the times and how all the pigeons are doing on his website and the owners can see how everything is going. People lose birds during training, some guys don\u2019t even make it to the race day because the babies don\u2019t come back from the  training flights. ( ever been to New York City, or any big city, and see pigeons everywhere and a few of them have bands around their legs. Those might be racing pigeons that didn\u2019t make their way back to the loft and decided to slum it up in the city) \ufffcIt\u2019s really neat how this works. \n\nWhen this \ufffcguy said his friend makes his livelihood from this he wasn\u2019t kidding. This is a full-time job. This guy has been raising and training those pigeons for, most likely, months.\ufffc Very sad for everyone involved.",

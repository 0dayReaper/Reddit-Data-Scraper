Remember, the job of a jury is to determine if it is \"beyond reasonable doubt\" that a crime was committed. Obviously, the injuries of the child and eyewitness testimony of the man would likely be enough to convict regardless, but if the man lies or the kid doesn't have any major injuries, a jury might not give a guilty verdict due to reasonable doubt.",

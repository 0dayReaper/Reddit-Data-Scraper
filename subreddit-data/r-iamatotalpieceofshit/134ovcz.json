I added a harness and tethered our dog to his kennel for training purposes (he was only like this for a training purposes when he was young). I went inside to grab water and he tried to hop the fence while still attached to his leash. When I got back outside, he was hanging like a pi\u00f1ata stuck on a fence panel with a doofus look on his face instead of strangled out. We taught him to not hop fences, and to not run up to people when they come over by tying him up. It only took him a month or two and he was able to be trusted to roam free in the backyard and he would give people their space when entering the backyard and he wouldn\u2019t bark unnecessarily. I don\u2019t know where I was going with this but people should really consider harnesses more often instead of collars with a leash. When we were teaching our dog to walk beside us, we were able to avoid him choking himself out by trying to pull us and we could easily stop him by lifting up on his harness so his front paws couldn\u2019t touch the ground eliminating any pulling without hurting him other than maybe his ego.",

Needless to say, when they came around a curve doing about 55 mph, poor pooch went sliding off back and hit ground. Truck pulled over as fast as they could but once dog quit rolling across hwy got up running in shock. Of course, after convincing themselves it wasn\u2019t really their fault they took off(no doubt to get another puppy they can raise the \u201ccowboy\u201d way). I stuck around for a few hours and eventually located dog about a half mile away in a creek bed. Was able to wrap a blanket around it and held it as my wife drove us to an all night emergency vet. Was too expensive for us to afford it\u2019s care it would need. So that\u2019s the story of me having a dog that was just at a year old put down.",

Back in my early teens, someone on a dog forum advised that our family dog was moderately overweight and I was defensive and in denial about it. I did learn that was true, and not only was our dog chubby then but most pet dogs are, to the point that people are used to it and think that dogs at a healthy weight are too skinny (even worse for sighthounds and working/sport dogs). Dogs should have a discernable waist from above and the side, have ribs that aren't sticking out but can be felt easily, etc. etc. Obviously underfeeding a dog is neglectful and cruel, but imo overfeeding a dog to the point of obesity is just as much so, but sadly it's usually overlooked or even praised as \"spoiling.\"",

Almost every other flatbed had a dog or three balancing on the back of it. My whole childhood it was excused as \"oh they're work dogs so they're used to it, they never fall off\". I kinda accepted this as the truth until one day on the road to our ranch we were following a flatbed piled higher than the cab with hay bales, and a blue heeler balancing nervously on the very top. When they went around a corner then accelerated he got so off balance he just decided to jump even though he was 12ft or so up. He hit the pavement and rolled twice before running along the road in shock. They caught up to him and had him jump in the cab before driving off.\nAfter seeing that I really realized how ridiculously cruel it is to leave dogs on flatbeds like this, and I can't believe it's completely legal.",

It a bit of a cult gem and stars Jake Gyllenhaal as a social shut-in who takes to filming gruesome scenes of car accidents, shootings and murders. It's a interesting watch if you can stomach it. A more thorough warning for those interested it is VERY graphic and depicts scenes with realistic gore, blackmail and sexual abuse as well as unobstructed views of suicide. Watch at your own risk.",

She'd been bred so much that when the vet spayed her for the rescue, her uterus shattered like thin glass. Her name was Sassy (that was her short name, I can't remember the name on her AKC papers). We renamed her Annwn because no way were we keeping any of her past life. She came to her name within a week.",

We named her 25 years ago and when I was looking for a good name for her all the sources said it was a Celtic name that meant from the fairy realm. I never saw the correct pronunciation at the time, though I looked. We pronounced it sort of Ahn-win. When I looked today what I found was it is Welsh, means from the under realm, and the one specific to Welsh pronunciation was closer to Ah-noo. I did still see a few sites that said it was pronounced like we did, but I'm not sure the correct way. Sorry",

You're probably imaging this animal clipping it's tail of the wire, falling on it's back, getting up and watching it's \"loving\" owner walk away, the dog wants to follow but it can't, it's going to be distressed, eventually it's going to get hungry and thirsty, it's going to panic, it's going to suffer, it's going to die. \n\nYou are capable of \"simulating\" all of this and it's called empathy but do you do that for rocks or objects like a tire on the side of the road? To people like this owner that's how it feels, incapable of empathy.\n\nOnce you accept that reality you can comprehend people like this. They are lacking that circuit that lets us feel emotions in our body for things that are not our body, like animals. About 10-20% of the population is like this.",

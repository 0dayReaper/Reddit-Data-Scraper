He had turned 18 so I had stopped paying support for him, and the entire amount went to her\u2026 that is what triggered me to get a paternity test done\u2026 my child support pavements had just increased to $350 a week and my wife suggested that I try and get in contact with my and see if she would do a paternity test ( she was pregnant VERY quickly into our relationship.) she agreed, but it took her another 6 months to actually get it done. \nSo\u2026. The test comes back and I am not his father. The child support agency reopens the case for my other son and says \u201cwell, since you were paying for two kids but should have been paying for one, you were actually only paying half of what you were meant to be paying for your first son, so you owe his mother the other half of the payments from the last 13 years. They then proceed to take close to $1000 fn from my wage to give to his mother - even though I\u2019d already paid it to my second boys mother. So I\u2019ve effectively paid it twice. I struggled for months when they were taking the $1000 a fn. I actually struggled for 13 years\u2026.. but now that she has to pay the money back to me, the child support agency still protects her by only taking the minimum amount from her each fn\u2026",

She actually hasn\u2019t committed fraud - she can just say she didn\u2019t know either. If I had a relationship with him, lawyer said i may have a better chance. It\u2019s not fraud - I can\u2019t for the life of me remember what my lawyer called it. She knew I wasn\u2019t the father though. Between getting the results back and going to court to get it all stopped was about three months - I was still paying child support to her during this time. About a week before we went to court I got a letter saying my child support case has been closed. So I called them and they said \u201cwe can\u2019t give you any information about her, but children can only have one child support case open.\u201d So she fucking knew who the father was and as soon as my gravy train dried up, she hit him up for money.\n\n2. She has no money so what\u2019s the point? I had costs awarded to me as well but haven\u2019t pursued them.\n\nShe owes me near enough to $60k and the child support agency takes $50 a fn. I\u2019ll be dead long before it\u2019s paid back, as will she.",

So the dad has to pay legal fees to prove paternity so that he doesn\u2019t get forced to support a kid that isn\u2019t his. It\u2019s really easy to have any guy you slept with in a similar time period get told he\u2019s the dad and that he\u2019s gonna owe cash.\n\nBaby trapping is slightly related to this, where a woman has a kid with a dude to \u201ctrap\u201d him financially to her.

Doesn't mean it's true / a legit claim, but it's up to the DA to actually go through with pressing charges. I know it's Tennessee, but I'd be a bit shocked if they don't press charges on that Walgreens case. \n\nI was taught that generally, traditional self-defense doctrines, one cannot resort to the use of deadly force in defense unless they have first tried unsuccessfully to retreat or remove themselves from the situation. \n\nA lot of states have \"stand your ground\" or \"shoot first\" laws that basically allow you to use deadly force if you feel it's necessary.\n\nSome states require that assailant against whom you are going to use deadly force must have a lethal weapon. Some states only allow you to do this to protect your personal home/property. Some let you do it in public too. \n\nA lot of states are getting rid of the duty to retreat part of these laws. That's why you can potentially murder someone, claim self-defense, and get away with it.",

Even in America, a story of someone hunting to their vehicle and shot down isn't that common. It's more common than it should be, but it should not be overtly common.\n\nThe problem is that once the trigger is pulled, there is no going back. There is no re do, no take backs, just consequences. America unnecessarily relies on consequences and punishment after the fact. Partially because as a country we are humongous and even if we had accurate policing, at best response time is a few minutes, at worst a few hours.\n\nYou can say all sorts of things, but it boils down that people with guns make rash decisions, and we deal with consequences.",

After about 1 to 2 minutes of loud pounding it just stopped and they left. \n\nAbout 15 minutes later, I hear a cop car and see sirens in my cul-de-sac. Cops ring my door bell. I open the door and they explain that a neighbor called the cops. I tell them what happened. They tell me that apparently a special needs kid (who was taller and heavy set) got confused as to which house was his and was just knocking on every white house until he found his. \n\nThis happened at least 15 years ago, but I still remember it.

One night in the first couple months of being married, all the lights were off in their apartment when my grandma was up in the dark grabbing a glass of water. Something startled my grandpa out of a dead sleep, he sat straight up in bed, and hadn't completely snapped to reality. He said sternly \"password\"... My grandma was too nervous to answer... He repeated himself but more angrily- \"password?!\" No answer... So he got out of bed, and as he was walking towards my grandma, my grandma made a really nervous \"meep\" sound... It brought my grandpa to reality. He walked over to turn the light on and started laughing saying \"haha, I'm so glad I didn't have to kill anybody!\"",

Idk how many people I've floored by informing them that even if they legally shoot someone and one of those bullets over penetrates (or they miss) and kill an innocent bystander, there's a good chance they'll face manslaughter charges and they'll go to prison and have a felony on their record.\n\nBut most go on thinking they're John Wick and can mag dump on the first person who inconveniences them enough.",

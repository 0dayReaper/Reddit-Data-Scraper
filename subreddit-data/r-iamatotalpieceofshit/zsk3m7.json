As they approached, they pulled their hoods and scarves over their faces, surrounded a car and opened all four doors of the driver waiting at the red light. One of the lads hit the woman, as the rest of the crew took her handbag and several shopping bags from the back seat. Then legged it. \n\nIt was so unexpected and so fast, that even sitting in the car directly behind her, I had barely removed my seatbelt and opened my door before they were gone. Though in retrospect, that may have been lucky for my own safety. The lady\u2019s face already had one of those bruises that turn immediately purple and one can watch as the swelling grows. \n\nThat punch was a cowardly low blow and totally unnecessary to the job they\u2019d assigned themselves. God, she was so confused and scared that someone had to be delegated to find her a cup of tea.",

I\u2019ve since been corrected.\n\nThereafter, I was reminded of the time I witnessed how fast these buggers can beat and rob you. Of how important it is to lock your doors and windows. Perhaps naively, I thought  sharing what I witnessed, would remind others to also keep their doors locked. Thus, I might help save another person from the fate of the woman I saw beaten. For nothing more than some crappy shopping and the same bag of useless crap we all keep in our bags on the passenger seat. \n\nIs that really a bad thing to warn others how quickly this can happen?",

I mean this in the nicest way possible. \n\nWhile ordinarily the a normal person parking at a disabled bay is wrong and I agree, the met police in London parking at a hospital usually signals an emergency. This also looks like the hospital in Euston, I bet they struggled to find parking. \n\nAs to your point about it it was an emergency they would park at the door that may not be the case if it is an incident that\u2019s not fully an emergency but needs urgent attention. \n\nAgain I apologise if you feel I\u2019m coming at you but it\u2019s just the way I see it.",

Added to the fact is that police can park anywhere without concequences so there is no need for them to take up one of the exceedingly limited disabled spaces. I care about this cause I am disabled I don't have a blue badge but I know how important it is to some people to be able to attend their hospital appointments.",

If you want to complain about anything complain of actual people (not law enforcement) who do these things. \n\nComplain about how ULEZ is being expanded which potentially could cost a lot for many people. Complain about the 20mph speed limits. Complain about the law enforcement who are troubling young people of colour in specific areas and racially profiling them. Complain about those things rather than complaining about them (potentially doing their job) parking in a disabled bay. The other posts on that subject had valid points. You don\u2019t.",

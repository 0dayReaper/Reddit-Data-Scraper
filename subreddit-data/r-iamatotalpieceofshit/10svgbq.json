They are required to have a USDA license if they ship dogs out of state sight unseen which I am guessing they do.\n\nI am a hedgehog breeder and have this license (exotics require it regardless of shipping), with it comes the phone number and ear of my local inspector. I can walk you through the process of getting this facility reported to the USDA, and I can get you the name or a contact of who to send this video to. Not providing water and adequate shelter are both violations.\n\nI cannot say that they will DO anything other than show up repeatedly, and write negative reports, and MAYBE revoke their license. But that is who is in charge above the state folks who aren\u2019t doing what they should be doing.",

I will say that I have contacted the USDA in the past and it didn't work out, though I can't recall exactly why at the moment; I \\*think\\* it had something to do with their license status or (possibly; this might be wrong) that they rely on Animal Welfare, which, as you said, is an arm of the USDA here.  But I would definitely like to speak with your contact, if they're willing.",

Like sure Jan, so are Mastiffs, Bulldogs, and Akita but I don't see you trying to ban those or portraying those as dangerous. \"But they're bred to kill\", and so are Terriers and most hounds but I don't see you complaining about those either. Even quite a few Shepharding and livestock dogs are bred to kill in order to protect livestock. There's very few breeds other than lap dogs these people's criticism wouldn't apply to. \n\nPitties do engage in the most violent incidents but people would rather say it's genetics than widespread abuse, training, maltreatment. It's a less scary idea, and also a simpler idea so it's appealing to those ignorant of the issues. If it's genetic you can just ban the dog and move on. If it's from treatment then it's only a matter of time before a new dog takes it's place when the shitty humans want a new breed to fight, guard, and abuse.",

            "comment": "I live in a part of Maine that's due to go down to -20\u00b0F/-45\u00b0 to -50\u00b0F wind chill tonight.  We have a puppy mill that usually keeps out about four dozen dogs on 1/3 of an acre.  The dogs are out in all weather, and there have been reports of all sorts of problems: tethers not legal length, houses not built to standard, problems with water provision, problems for the community w/ barking &amp; urine odor.  It's a mess.  Of course, the dogs are out today, too.\n   \nThe video was taken this morning, when it was a relatively balmy 7\u00b0F, wind already howling.  ([This video](https://old.reddit.com/user/archilchimes/comments/10iqi3c/montage/) shows what the place is usually like; snow's obscuring stuff now.) \n  \nLast year, the dogs were out in -22\u00b0F weather\u2014not with today's wind chill, but still.  At the time, I tried phoning Maine's Animal Welfare department.  The officer answering hung up all three times, refusing to take any report about the property.  This is Animal Welfare's standard procedure; they've hung up on any and all reports I and others attempted to file.\n   \nThe local animal control officer is no better; he typically won't answer his phone and has actively covered for the place before.  We've gotten excuses from the authorities like:\n    \n* These are show dogs!  Animal welfare law doesn't apply to them.\n  \n* We need you to submit 24/7 surveillance footage of the property before we'll investigate.  (This in response to the dogs' water sources being frozen solid.)\n  \n* The owner's knowledge of animal welfare law is so encyclopedic, he'd know better what was legal than \\*we\\* would!  (So the owner's allowed to determine whether he's breaking the law, apparently.)\n  \n* Our officer says his feelings were hurt by you calling, so we don't feel like investigating.  (For the last -22\u00b0F incident. Phone guy lied that I had called him names during the call, which his superior used to justify not taking a report.  I sent a recording of the call proving otherwise.  I never heard back.)\n  \n* We allegedly investigated the puppy mill once, so we're not going to investigate any more complaints about this property, no matter the evidence.\n  \n* Oh, that video is outdated!  The property's actually been \\*completely\\* renovated to eliminate any code violations.  Anything you see showing otherwise is a lie.\n  \n* Any video of conditions at the mill was deepfaked by criminals.  (Yes, seriously.)\n    \nIt's such a goddamn clown show, and it's gone from ignoring the situation into outright covering for the place.  Trying to get others involved is no better; everyone defers to the word of either the ACO or Animal Welfare, whatever excuse they give, and that seems to be the end of it.\n   \nGiven the publicity for the cold snap, we did finally get in touch with an animal welfare org that actually got the authorities to get an inspection of the place today instead of the usual hang up/ignore routine. However, the inspection team apparently includes a) one of the owner's friends from government and b) the ACO who's scared shitless of the owner.  I'm not convinced they'll find anything wrong.  \n  \nI will say that the baffles are actually new.  (Previously, they didn't have them, even though the law requires \"a baffle or other means of keeping wind and precipitation out of the interior.\")  A step like this is the equivalent of the moon landing for the owner.  \n   \nStill: even if the animals can make it through in these conditions, I can't see an argument for it being humane.",

People who do this shouldn't be allowed to own any pets. Would you leave a child outside with weather gear? No so why a dog w barely any protection?

When I called up, they informed me that they don't get involved in rescues; they only take care of dogs *after* rescue.  They didn't even refer me to anyone else.  \n\nSome many of the organizations you thing would intervene in cases like this just fall down in actually helping out.  The Humane Society was similarly hands-off.",

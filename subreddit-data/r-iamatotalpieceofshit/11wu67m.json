And I wish I had the actual data, but anecdotally it really seems like there is a disproportionate number of spousal murder cases where this is their religion. I do think that the general mindset of divorce being fundamentally wrong/sinful can make people feel unbearably trapped in some cases. Still, they have to make the decision to commit murder, it\u2019s not like murder is literally being preached. I also think this religion (and many religions) give men the idea that their authority is just, no matter what they decide \u2026 if you combine that with a psycho who is already inclined to murder, that\u2019s a bad combination.",

                                    "comment": "There's a lot that goes into this. So from my perspective, I'm Mormon (yes, yes, downvote me, your boos mean nothing to me) and a big thing that could contribute to this correlation that not many consider is lack of vices. Mormons don't drink, don't smoke, weed is obviously a no-no, and even coffee and tea are contrary to the religious teachings. Because of this, mormons are (anecdotaly) stressed out people. High stress situations make people do unpredictable things and lash out in ways that someone wouldn't normally do.\n\nThere's also, like with many other religions, a cultural following (those that are from multi-generational families. We've always been this way, we will continue to be this way, and we won't change because that's just what we do) and a secular following (I'm of X faith because I want/choose to be, this is where I feel I belong, this is what I want). Your secular mormons are the ones that are normal people and blend very nicely into society. They're typically the ones that lean more liberal in ideas than your cultural followers. Cultural followers are your typical Utah mormon. These are the kind that's typically portrayed in media and I'd be willing to bet is the kind our prime example in the post falls under. They typically have the mindset as mentioned by the comment above me. Utah is a prime example of why having a single mindset in one condensed location is a horrible idea. Jesus taught that we must be the salt of the Earth, and I don't know about you but I like my food lightly salted all over, not dumped all on my potatoes.\n\nThe church has its issues, certainly. No argument here. I take the Sanderson approach about it though. Author Brandon Sanderson said it best when asked in a semi-recent AMA when someone asked how he reconciled being a member of the church in relation to LGBTQ+ issues. He said\n\n&gt;I have faith in the church, I have had spiritual experiences, confirming to me that this is where God wants me and that God is real.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There is a passage in the Book of Mormon where someone is asked a question that they can not answer. Their response is just to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know the meaning of all things, but I know God loves his children.\u201d This is my answer in some cases to some of the difficult questions we get asked.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That's not to say we shouldn't change or listen. If you look through my own history with LGBTQ people, I needed some education as many did. (I still do, honestly.) It is a process where we learn from listening and we get better and hopefully become better people. Both as a culture and as individuals. If I want an institution or person to change, I personally believe that to ostracize them is not the right move in most cases. Ihis is different from how most people see it--and these people may be right and I may be wrong, time will tell.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Still, my belief is that--by being a more liberal member of the church and remaining with the church and remaining at BYU--I have a better chance of positive change. If everyone who is a little more left than the institute leaves it, that will not help the institution or the people who go there. For example, if people who go to my class know that I am doing my best to be an ally, then perhaps they will feel safer and the whole thing will work out better.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I don't have all the answers, though. Again to use a religious metaphor, God gave 2 contradictory sets of commands to Adam and Eve and said \"Figure it out.\" I believe in LGBTQ+ advocacy and in listening--then changing my behavior and the way I approach the world based on the things they say. I also believe that the leaders of the church are chosen by God, and lead his church well. These things don't quite meet in the center yet. Perhaps they never will, and I will be forced to make different choices from the ones I have so far. But right now, I believe I'm in the right place, where I should be, and I believe in the message, doctrine, and teachings of the church.\n\nThank you for coming to my ramble.\n\nEdit: Fixed misplaced quotes",

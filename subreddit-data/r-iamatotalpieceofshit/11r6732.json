Life is over. Work him to the bone on something profitable for life (digging ditches? Road work? Etc with exteme oversight and brutal penalties for failing to comply) in something physical, turnover a portion of the profit to the victim, and the world is a slightly better place.\n\nThat's a type of reform that would be welcome, vs prisons just siphoning off money from taxpayers in exchange for essentially providing low quality housing and food for criminals",

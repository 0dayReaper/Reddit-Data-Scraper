There's a reason why safe, sane and consensual engagements are so heavily needed here. Everyone has a responsibility for their health, as what one wants isn't the best. I should know, I'm an avid fan of sugary sweets due to a strong sweet tooth. But I know that it's not good for my body, so I try to practice restraint here and there so I don't go too far. I think masochism as a concept should just be pathologized because there's usually much deeper issues at play here, like self-esteem.",

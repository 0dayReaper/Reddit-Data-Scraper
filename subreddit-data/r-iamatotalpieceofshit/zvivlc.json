He was threatening people by spraying them. Which if you don\u2019t know asthma is a common chronic disease. Not to mention a normal person breathing in the fumes is very dangerous. So its likely someone there was someone very hurt by this. So he obviously doesn\u2019t care he hurt someone or is thoughtful of his actions. If someone ran up and started beating him he would obviously start hitting them with the extinguisher. Or use whatever force they may have. Lots of things can be lethal weapons. Better to be safe than sorry. Also other people in the comments were saying something about him or his buddies having a gun so chill dude.",

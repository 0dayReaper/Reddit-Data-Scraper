It\u2019s double edged sword really because if young immigrants don\u2019t come then there won\u2019t be enough people to pay taxes to keep the system afloat. If you can\u2019t to get 2.2 births per woman, then you have to fill the gap with immigrants, otherwise the system will eventually collapse given current cost structures.  Could this radically change with tech, sure and it probably will, allowing older people to live healthier lives and thereby reduce costs.  My prediction is that NHS will have to cut back or fold before that happens.",

You can barely drive the highways even several days after the storm. Theres a site where you can listen to the snow plows and police radios that a lot of people are listening to to try to stay informed and find resources. Tons of people are stranded and the city is overwhelmed with requests for help. It\u2019s really really bad out there.",

There are two different ways of thinking of racism:\n\nThe simplistic way, used in conversational English: Person 1 views Person's 2 race as somehow less than, defective, or inferior AND/OR they make assumptions based on Person 2's race.  This is an informal notion of the word and is tied to discrimination and prejudice.\n\nThen you have what you're referring to above, which is used by those taking a social view of racism. Behavioral scientist Dr. Pragya Agarwal puts it like this:\n\n&gt;\"White people can indeed face stereotypical assumptions based on their skin color and hence encounter racial prejudice.  But this cannot be called racism, because of the inherent systemic imbalance of power between those with lighter skin and people of color.\n\n&gt;\"Racial prejudice can affect people on an individual level, but it would not have the same effect on a larger sociol and cultural level because it is only when stereotypes are bolstered by power, such as through a eurocentric model of thinking, that it creates systemic and structural racism and oppression that people of color have encountered throughout history.\"\n\nSo, in your example of white Africans, you have to take into account the historical impact of things like Apartheid.  That is systemic racism.  I went to Africa in the 90s, and it was pretty clear that there was an imbalance of power.\n\n\nHope this helps some, there seems to be a lot of confusion on this topic.\n\n\nEdit: formatting",

It\u2019s really really bad out here right now. \n\n\nNot to mention that the radio is a public resource. You can listen to it at any time for any reason and even make calls on it. It\u2019s not like a phone where it\u2019s peer to peer connections. It\u2019s a broadcast to whoever might be listening. The only way to avoid that is to have a set frequency and scramble the signal somehow, but generally police and emergency services are public broadcasts intended for civilians to listen to for a variety of reasons like accountability and intelligence on hazards or road closures.",

I was paid as much as the other new Dockhands, they had me work only when it was legal, and it wasn\u2019t dangerous at all because I had grown up around boats and didn\u2019t even need to be trained. My father did it because he wanted us to learn how to work, but it was never a big \u201cneed\u201d. I wasn\u2019t forced to, if I didn\u2019t want the job I wouldn\u2019t of had it.\n\nThis Arkansas bill is simply not the same of what I just said or the anecdote you gave. They\u2019re allowing 9 year olds to work. You ever work with 9 year olds? I have for the last 9 years. They absolutely should not be working. They are simply too young, too bad with directions, and cannot understand complex concepts for their job to even be safe. If they\u2019re being exploited through less pay or in danger due to shitty conditions, they won\u2019t know because they simply don\u2019t know any better. And that\u2019s not even to mention this bill allows 9 year olds to work INSTEAD OF going to school, having dire consequences for them just 9 years later.\n\nI\u2019m sorry about your situation of working at 15, but I both wonder how long ago that was and if you had to skip school for your job (which would have been illegal in the employer\u2019s part). Also, at 15 you\u2019re much smarter than at 9. You simply would have developed more and would know more about the world. At 15, you can keep yourself safe because you know better, most 9 year olds cannot.\n\nUltimately this bill is going to force the poorest kids into working. They\u2019ll give up their education to help their family, either because they\u2019re forced to or because they\u2019re desperate enough. And this isn\u2019t even to mention the employers who will take advantage of children or the Nparents who will force their kids to work instead of going to school while pocketing the money. All this bill does is make the exploitation of children easier while stripping away their right to an education and overall their right to a childhood.",

You think the employers care about your kid? \u2026\u2026.\n\nAnother fact is that kids are already losing their ability to learn with early school hours and sleep deprivation. There are multiple research papers identifying this educational issue. Add a job on top after school and you expect them to perform the same as their peers? You expect them complete their homework and also be healthy and grow a strong foundation while making money? \n\nI worked when I was 17, I wanted to work earlier to make money to help out and support my own activities beyond school. My family are first generation immigrants who didnt have anything. But because I was able to actually focus on school I LEARNED the importance of having a good education. My parents did everything in their power to promote my education even though they had to work shitty jobs because they were immigrants (i.e my mother who was an electrical engineering professor had to work at nail salons giving people pedicures for 8-12 hours 6 days a week because of poor english.)\nGot my bachelors dumped my job as a salesman and worked jobs in college as teaching assistants, research etc. went to medical school and have a family that I will also educate on the importance of establishing a future. Short term monetary gain for a child/family is long term sacrifice for a better future. Realistically these children will not be making a lot even if they work jobs that give you tips(an unreliable source of income due to the tipping industry.

One is that there is litigation in the Iowa to repeal restrictions on the types of places teenagers can work- notably meat packing and butchery plants, as well as factories. This same litigation would protect employers from civil cases if employees get harmed working at these jobs. \n\nSecondly, not too long ago, Arkansas, as well as a few other states had a company that had to pay out a civil lawsuit for employing children in unsafe conditions.",

Plus if the child is even forced to sign (there are sickos out there that would) it wouldn\u2019t be too bad- spend a couple evenings making $60- that\u2019s just like the odd jobs you find kids doing everywhere. There is certainly room for debate here and I completely expect some criticism, but at the same time I\u2019m speaking from personal experience here. My parents actually didn\u2019t want me to get a job. I applied at Walmart anyway on my 16th birthday. Other kids are the same way.

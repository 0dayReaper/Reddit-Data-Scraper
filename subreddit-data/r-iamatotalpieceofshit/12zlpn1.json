I will never forget the time a guy came by with his windows down and my stream of water in slowMo hitting this dudes radio, steering wheel, and dead center in the chest. It was a super soaker and we where about 7 feet away. It splashed all over his face and dash. \n\nDude slammed on his brakes and chased us till we jumped in some bushes and my friends dad came to save us. We got in trouble but at least didn\u2019t get beat up by some random person.",

But then there was an appeal and his sentence was reduced to something very minimal, at which point it might have been time served. I think he served around a year in jail, maybe a bit less, maybe a bit more.",

The third, if he serves any time at all, will likely be out in probably three years.  He\u2019ll be in his early-20\u2019s.  Young enough to still live a full life.  \n\nThis is how it\u2019s gone for the other murderous scum found guilty of killing motorists with thrown objects.  They\u2019ll be shamed in the news now after getting caught, they\u2019ll pop up again during their trial, and they\u2019ll walk unannounced back into the sunlight when it\u2019s all over.

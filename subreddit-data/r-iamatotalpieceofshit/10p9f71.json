I'm pretty embarrassed by a lot of the comments here and frankly hope they're either trolling or don't own animals. \n\nAre there dogs like Akitas and Huskies that are fine and comfortable in extremely cold weather and even prefer it? Yeah. They also have double and triple layer coats that have incredible insulative properties that allow them to thrive in that weather. The German Shepherd in the back of the truck didn't look like it was bothering him that much.... HOWEVER\n\nThe short haired dog was visibly shaking and clearly VERY uncomfortable. The temp yesterday (and today) has been in the low single digits. Driving in the back of a truck at 35 mph at 5\u00b0f gives you a wind chill of -19.5\u00b0F (-28.6\u00b0C). Not only that, but everything is fucking frozen, including the bed of this guy's truck, and they were sliding around and couldn't get a grip. Do you think a wolf would have fun sliding around banging into the back of a frozen truck? What is wrong with you people?\n\nNot sure what the people justifying this guy's actions are going for... There's no excuse for not putting down a towel and letting them ride in the warm cab. Some of y'all are just totalpiecesofshit.",

I know some dogs grow up in tough situations (some mistreated), and that can lead to an aggressive dog that feels they have to fight for their survival. But they really are the sweetest and most loving creatures I can think of. Moreso than most humans.",

Animals have feelings just like we do. If we're cold, so are they. Fur can only do so much for so long, and for dogs with short hair, it's like if we stood outside in this weather wearing nothing but a t-shirt, shorts, and sandals. Keep your animals in warm, safe spots. Don't chain them up in the backyard like they'll transform when there's a full moon out. Don't put them in the back of your pickup, just out in the open like this idiot did. Dogs are nothing but kind to us, so why can't we be kind to them?",

Two pups from an even colder climate that survived a ship wreck. \n\nThe black lab has similar background in the Labrador bay area. \n\nThose are just two examples. There are many more.",

Get him up there and he was shaking and acting like he was going to die every time I took him outside. Finally, I just took his leash off and let him run during a whiteout with 70 mph winds. I thought for sure he was a goner. Cue 4 hours later, a neighbor called and he was barking at a guy shoveling his driveway. I walked the few streets over, braving frostbite to find him happily running up and down the street, playing in the 20 inches of snow we were getting like it was a party. I just turned around and he followed me home, where he chose to stay outside for another hour. Fuckin dogs\u2026",

The only time I wouldn't have a problem with someone having their dog in the bed of their truck is if they are driving around on their own property and the dog just rolled in manure or something. My dad saw things go badly for a dog in the back of a truck with a leash tied to one side. I hate it when people say \"but my dog likes being in the back\". Sure, your dog would probably also like to eat steak every meal with a side of horse poop and some chocolates for dessert, but you don't let it do that do you?",

Granted they are outside, working, *dogs for his sheep* (1 is a greater Anatolia mix, the other a Border Collie) &amp; def a little more built for it but I was house/dog sitting last year &amp; on a day that was about -10 most of the day &amp; figured I\u2019d bring them in. I coaxed them in with treats &amp; they stayed for about 20mins, started panting &amp; wanted more than anything to get back outside\u2026 If they are working dogs &amp; live outside, they often prefer it. Not saying this is 100% the case here w/these dogs, but there\u2019s a lot of people, making a lot of assumptions\u2026",

I thought I\u2019d be helping them &amp; that they must be cold but they live outside year round &amp; have grown thick healthy coats &amp; they didn\u2019t want to be in the house. They have the best lives a dog could have, imo. They\u2019re fed &amp; treated really well, bc they are like co-workers &amp; a huge part of what makes his ranch run smoothly &amp; they have more freedom than any house dog would ever have. It\u2019s incredible to see the collie move sheep &amp; the Anatolia is a beast that protects the sheep from coyotes &amp; other predators but is the gentlest, friendliest dog to people &amp; kids you\u2019ve ever seen, but they live &amp; WORK outside w/the sheep everyday &amp; night &amp; love it. \nThey have insulated houses down by the sheep &amp; that\u2019s what they prefer\u2026",

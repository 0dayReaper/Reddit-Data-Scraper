Description:

A place to post screenshots or gifs of people acting like a piece of shit. The worst of the worst, people who you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy.

Rules:

Redact all identifying information: This includes, but is not limited to: first and last names, usernames (including your own &amp; the mobile symbol identifying you), subreddit and online community names, post titles, and other information like addresses or phone numbers.  

Do not ask for personal information, suggest someone should be doxxed, link to or comment with personal information, or contact the people featured here. You will be banned.

Do not post reddit screenshots

No exceptions; Not even for "public figures."

Do not encourage, glorifiy, or incite violence.: For example: "Kill yourself", "It wouldn't be so bad if we killed all the pedophiles", "This guy needs to die", "I hope this guy gets stabbed to death with a rusty screwdriver", etc.

All glorification, advocacy, or suggestions of violence, EVEN IN JEST, will be permanently banned, no exceptions, and no possibility of leniency.

Must be a total piece of shit: A total piece of shit is someone who is intentionally harming people or animals. Bad parking, memes, political posts, screenshots of user profiles, anti-vax idiots, and petty arguments don't belong here. If your post isn't shitty enough, it'll be removed.  

Do not post your personal drama.

If you post a picture with the backstory in the title or comments &amp; no story in the image, or just the face of a public figure, you will be banned. This isn't punchablefaces.

Do not post reddit screenshots.

Avoid reposting: 

No news articles. Images, screenshots  &amp; gifs only.: Reddit's native hosting and https://imgur.com/upload are preferred. Please take a screenshot of the article, preferably the title plus a paragraph or two, or link the video through imgur or v.redd.it. Screenshots of the headline only will be removed. This is because no one reads articles, even in article subreddits; articles rarely get more than 50 upvotes here, and articles inherently include personal info for somebody, which is not allowed in any form about any person.

No posts featuring gore, animal or child abuse.: Posts featuring gore/child/animal abuse are not allowed.

No screenshots of subreddits, reddit profiles, reddit posts, reddit comments, or reddit messages: No screenshots of reddit profiles, posts, comments, or direct messages. Not even if you hide usernames. 

If you submit anything related to something happening on reddit you will be banned. This is to prevent harassment. Don't bring your reddit drama here.

No racism/hate speech/bigotry/idiotic race baiting: No racism, homophobia, transphobia, or other bigotry.  If they're a piece of shit, you don't need to bring their whole demographic into it.

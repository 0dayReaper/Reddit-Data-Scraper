            "comment": "Servers at a Mexican restaurant in Ohio worked for only $10 a week in addition to tips left by customers, according to federal authorities. Meanwhile, officials say the cooks worked 60 hours a week without any overtime pay.\n\nNow the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Wage and Hour Division has recovered $245,509 in back wages for six servers and 12 cooks who worked for Los Mariachis amid the labor violations, according to a Feb. 14 news release. Los Mariachis LLC, based in Wauseon, did not provide a comment to McClatchy News regarding the division\u2019s investigation.\n\nFederal authorities said the servers at Los Mariachis worked an average of 60 hours a week. Every two weeks, they\u2019d be forced to cash their full paycheck, then return all but $20 in pay, according to the release.\n\nThe federal Fair Labor Standards Act requires tipped employees earn a \u201cCombined Cash &amp; Tip Minimum Wage Rate\u201d of $7.25 an hour. The minimum hourly cash wage is $2.13 an hour.\n\nWorkers are also expected to get overtime pay \u2014 worth a rate of at least one and one-half times the regular pay rate \u2014 for hours over 40 in a given workweek. \u201cThe $245,590 in back wages our investigation recovered will make a significant difference in the lives of 18 Los Mariachis\u2019 workers and their families,\u201d Wage and Hour Division District Director Matthew Utley said in the release.\n\n\u201cNo server should be forced to work for just tips and $10 per week, and no cook should be paid straight time for 20 hours of overtime. Payment of at least the minimum wage and overtime has been the law of the land for 85 years, and every person working in the U.S. has the right to be paid their full-earned wages.\u201d Los Mariachis\u2019s owner has agreed to comply with federal wage laws moving forward, authorities said.",

I'm sorry, but how is this person not in jail or still being allowed to run this business? $250,000 of wages is not some kind of \"my bad, I misunderstood the wage laws and I've fixed the problem moving forward,\" kinda money. This is blatant and egregious theft. You got caught stealing from your employees, there's no backtracking.\n\nI'm guessing some of these employees were \"under the radar\" so the owner was taking advantage of that, probably threatening to report the employees if they said anything. This person knew exactly what they were doing and needs to be locked up, this is pretty much human trafficking.",

When you sue someone, you can sue for personal damages and the like, but those are non-criminal charges. Criminal charges are handled by the state and criminal prosecutors work for the government. People can\u2019t just do whatever and not go to jail if no one hires an attorney. \n\n\u201cYes, this guy murdered 20 people but no one has hired an attorney to sue him so there\u2019s nothing we can do about it.\u201d -the police \n\nPoint being, the employees could potentially sue for other lost wages or damages (or anything really but it doesn\u2019t mean they will win) but anything the employees sue for won\u2019t bring criminal charges. If they bring to light other illegal activity and can provide evidence, then it\u2019s up to the government to decide if they want to pursue charges and prosecute \u2014 again, this would not be on the employee to hire a lawyer.\n\nBut to your point, who knows why they decided it wasn\u2019t enough to pursue criminal charges. Perhaps they believed the guy really didn\u2019t understand the law (although ignorance is not a valid excuse for violating law) or like you said, they don\u2019t care enough about crimes committed against immigrants.",

Just the police refusing to investigate criminal acts against poor individuals and claiming it to be a \"civil matter\" with the knowledge that those individuals don't have the money to retain a lawyer for civil action against somebody is a form of class conflict. You want the same protections as wealthy Americans? You have to pay for it. Just look at how missing person's cases are treated by the police for a clear illustration of the inequity.",

Even in cases where it's explicitly clear that is what was happening, the DA just goes after them for wage violations instead. \n\n\nLots of reasons for that, in large part because most lawyers are only comfortable with cases that have actual case law and precedent behind them.

They should have been paid as 70 hours, not the flat 60, but I'd hardly call it slavery.\n\n  I'll also sniff at the assumption that a significant portion of the workers must be illegal immigrants working \"under the radar\" because it's a mexican restraunt.

Seems crazy right? Welcome to American labor law! \n\nI don't think it is a coincidence that the crimes ordinary citizens with little power commit are punished severely while the crimes the wealthly and powerful commit are ignored or barely punished. \n\nThe really crazy part is the all of us ordinary citizens could have the power to change things like this if we could only learn to stand together.\n\nSo if you, like me, think that the owner of the restaurant in question not going to jail is insane, then organize!!

Or they will have one but not the other.\n\nA lot of people say \u201cI know how to cook and people love my food! I should open a restaurant!\u201d But that\u2019s not how it works. Your friends and family loving what you cook does not equal everyone in your town loving what you cook.\n\nA lot of research has to be done BEFORE opening a restaurant: location, competition, cost of ingredients/stock, cost of labor, storage, compliance with regulations, licensing, food and liquor vendors, marketing, and a whole lot more.\n\nMost people maybe figure out two or three of those things before investing a buttload of money. Then they get a false sense of security because new restaurants attract people. The problem is that you need all of the things I listed above to work harmoniously to keep the customers coming back. That\u2019s where most people fail.\n\nThen when they realize people aren\u2019t coming back they start hemorrhaging money. Which leads to them cutting corners and driving even more people away. Then morale starts to fade amongst staff. Now the owners have a failing restaurant, they\u2019re losing tens of thousands of dollars, and they can\u2019t dig themselves out.\n\nWatch \u201cKitchen Nightmares\u201d with Gordon Ramsey. The show itself is a bit dramatized but the stories that the people tell are very real and are happening daily across the united states and many other countries.",

It's usually quite low but for those who are really struggling it can be a barrier. There's also the risk of overdrawing the account, and then encountering an overdraft fee. If you are very poor you may not be able to supply an ID or other documentation to even open the account regardless of having the minimum balance. There are a lot of factors and there's also just a general lack of financial education available to impoverished communities.",

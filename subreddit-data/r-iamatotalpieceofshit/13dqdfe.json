It does have a long-lasting effect on the dog's personality. People have to worry about things like parvo of course so you have to be careful who you allow the dog to socialize with. Maybe at first just other puppies whose owners have been careful. Also you can take your dog at a very young age out in public you just need to carry it. Even just seeing other dogs playing from a distance can be helpful for socialization",

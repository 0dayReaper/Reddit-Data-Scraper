Somehow, they've been kept out of a certain level of thinking about things, about others. Mainly by parents who simply want obedient behavior or something. So the kids literally don't have a lot of things going on at all. As horrible as they seem, they should be completely forgiven because of this, if it's kids/teens. Sounds like I'm being too soft, but this is just how it is. They literally have to be brought into a broader understanding before any responsibility can be levied on them. It really is mainly an adult/child thing where the adults don't bring the children into \"adult thinking\". The kids then can be fucking monsters.",

You have to close the distance, it\u2019s also super loud so any victims would here you coming. You can kill someone with almost anything, but it\u2019s easiest with a gun.

Too many children finding them in the house, young and stupid people flashing them in the streets, and alcoholic boomers itching to start an argument with their neighbor. And the argument of \u201cbut it\u2019s not going to stop people, they\u2019ll find a way anyway\u201d ok so we should just give up? Restrictions and vetting will weed some out, Not everyone, but we have to fucking try! Giving everyone a gun just means the crazies will start shooting first and more innocents will get hurt",

Their own ridiculous, antiquated, racist and disgusting discriminatory beliefs. It\u2019s ok to mock someone\u2019s death  but you do it to them and they want to become martyrs and kill innocents. What\u2019s worse, a lot of them come to the US to be free from their hate and be themselves. They live freely gay here.  I\u2019ve seen it multiple times. These idiots need to live in this century.  They need to be educated themselves so that they\u2019re not taught the beliefs of a madman and claim it as gospel. In fact, they rape young men over there but No, they\u2019re not homosexual\u2019s right?   Believe that one, I\u2019ll tell you another one about an invisible man that fell in love with a woman.",

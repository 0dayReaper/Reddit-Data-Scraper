If you use a landline the police can still tell where you are and will still come out regardless of anything.

The NSA does the FBI probably does but your local police office does not.",

This happens fairly often and particularly if someone is calling from a deactivated cellphone. Also, poorer cities and counties don't always have the best 911 systems, some places still have 911 that routes to their landlines ffs. Not to mention within a county you can have addresses that are the exact same street name and number in different towns. For example 105 e main st, and furthermore you can easily have a 105 e main and a 105 w main. Just because the tech exists doesn't mean that everyone has it. So many things can go wrong with 911 and it does all the time, trunks go down, ANI and ALI doesn't always work, mapping systems go down or error. You sure you dispatched for 4 years? Lol, it's always Murphy's Law in dispatch.",

The closest the UK has to that is its separate countries (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). \n\nThe disparity of legislation between states is considerably less than the disparity of legislation between the UK's countries. If it's legal in the England, it's likely legal in the other three countries of the UK, for example. That's why when someone from the UK says \"it's legal in the UK\" it's very unlikely it'll be illegal in any one of the UK's constituent parts. Conversely, in the US it's more a case of \"filtering is legal\" followed by a 50 row table with a yes/no/maybe field to identify if it's legal in whichever individually governed and legislated state you are.",

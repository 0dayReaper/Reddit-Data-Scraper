Both of us supposedly have four years clean now, he's always posting about \"forgiveness and how thankful he is for all the people that helped him at his worst and blah blah blah and Praise Jesus blah blah blah\".... Jesus would literally spit in his face for this post, all the hate crimes happening, all the mass shootings that happened in this country, and you make a joke about it. About killing a trans person. F****** disgusting",

However, pitbulls do have negative instincts that are more commonly found in their breed like going for the throat, being more likely to grab at a small animal or child, or being overly protective. Many terrier breeds have similar instincts. However, a well looked after and well trained dog might not actually display those instincts. Also, being that they\u2019re a large muscly breed that looks scary, the type of person to get one might get one for the wrong reasons and teach it to be aggressive, or take such bad care of it that it gets aggressive anyway.  \n\nThat\u2019s where the problems start to manifest. A terribly trained pug isn\u2019t much of an issue. A terribly trained pittie can take out a few kids.",

An employee stopped me and I had to explain the situation and they were thankfully cool with it and let me buy it and go, but before that I distinctly remember being told non-service animals weren't allowed because of sanitation concerns.",

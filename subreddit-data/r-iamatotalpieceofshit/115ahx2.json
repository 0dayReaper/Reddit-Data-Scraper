The first car didn\u2019t do anything crazy enough to make the person feel like they NEEDED to check their mirrors 2) I feel like if I did notice the first car doing that I\u2019d be too busy making sure they didn\u2019t spin out Infront of me and cause a collision to immediately be frantically checking my mirrors in the 6 seconds between them passing and impact. 3) Merge left to where? We\u2019ve got one lane to work with and 6 seconds between first car passing and second car making impact. The second car would have likely been difficult to see in mirrors when they\u2019re obviously coming up behind POV car, and moving VERY quickly between lanes. Victim car also had ti be watching the truck, and any knee jerk reaction moves to avoid the car behind them would have either sent them left into the dangerous embankment or right under the wheels of the semi. It\u2019s cute that you think victim blaming is appropriate here. You\u2019re really showing a lack of awareness",

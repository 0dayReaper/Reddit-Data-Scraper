These pple just suck, why label them \"foreigners\" too much time on the 4chan OP, FYI people can be POs and America (not gonna say they are new Yorkers, but that accent reeks of Staten Island)",

I have several times and it's not quite as easy just Donnie yening your way through them as they patiently wait their turn to get punched,  and you're probably not going to be gracefully flowing around them avoiding all their blows like the whirlwind of violence you might imagine. \n\nDo any of them have knives in their pockets? Probably at least one does and then how are you going to deal with that? \n\n I have 2 scars from blades one is a smallish but significant stab I was able to fight through and won, seriously hurting them. The second one was a slice that opened me up from just under my shoulder to just under my sternum severing through muscles, a major artery and some bone. This immediately ended the fight with the person with the blade running (don't think he expected the wound to be so extreme) and other people rushing to push bits of me back together until the ambulance arrives.\n\nI personally would start fighting here but I've had to live a very violent life and am comfortable with it. But maybe the best thing this guy could for her was to just stay with her unless these fools escalate to being physical.",

After calling 911 and staying on the line to ensure they heard there was no conflict they arrested me stating that someone had to go. Me of course. She even refused medical attention after. My bond was $100k. They offered me 15 years. I refused and demanded a speedy trial. I was taking no offers. 30 days i spent on a max security pod with people who murdered, raped, etc. I saw people come back from court with life sentences. 30 days later my charges were magically dropped. By the state and not her. Was told i had no recourse because it didnt go to court.",

The fact she refused medical treatment on top of it all, after being \u201cthrown down a flight of stairs\u201d while pregnant should also play a role here.  Charges magically being dropped means they realized they had no actual evidence to prosecute him, let alone hold him. I guarantee you he didn\u2019t consult a lawyer here, and he instead asked one of the people who were involved in the process of releasing him what recourse he had - which of course our government officials can legally lie to us, so they told him \u201cnada you\u2019re screwed, be grateful we dropped everything and you\u2019re not facing prison\u201d.",

My friend found her slumped against the wall, eyes open. Drowned from her own lungs. All it would have taken was a chest X-ray to save her. \n&gt;\nAn older woman came in and tried for five days to get her heart medicine prescribed. The cops ignored her and she passed away in her bunk. It was sad too because she had been trying to get ahold of her daughter and couldn\u2019t the whole time. \n&gt;\nAcross from us in the mens unit, we saw a guy get thrown headfirst from the top tier.

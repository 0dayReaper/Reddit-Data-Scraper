An alcoholic cannot drive simply because his blood alcohol concentration is above some arbitrary number, and you call that fair? How will he get to work without driving? These systems do nothing but ensure alcoholics stay poor, and one day I hope you realize how destructive this is to not only alcoholics, but the nation as a whole.",

Anytime they needed a place,  I ignored my apartment's no animals rule because their dogs were so well behaved and sweet.  I even saw one of them stand outside a Walmart asking people if they could buy dog food even tho he had no food himself. \n\n(I had no food at my place.  I was early twenties, minimum wage, and all spending money went to beer and cigarettes after my bills)\n\nEdit: The dogs im talking about were not skinny, sick, or had fleas.  Also,  I've known these people for years and the dogs are always in great health.  These people often worked odd jobs for money.  They traveled about, so when they got to a new place, they might have run out of cash,  so they ask for money.  So they still fed the dogs.  You people who have no experience with their lifestyles need to realize how much strangers help people le this. \n\nFFS the particular instance im talking about,  a lady bought the dog food,  a toy,  some treats and I think other stuff.  The dogs are fine.\n\nY'all are the kinds of people who think homeless people shouldn't have phones or handheld video games.",

I'm a homebody (hitchiked a little but never train hopped myself), and a cat person, but my train hopping buddies had the friendliest dogs, never felt scared to be around those dogs, and they were hearty. When they visited they were always very calm and gentle with my cat (even when my cat swatted at them lol).\n\nMy wife wants to get a dog and theres a high bar for what I'd say is a \"real dog\" she wants something small, but I've never met a small dog thats not been an anxiety ridden little shit.\n\nNow that I think of it, I actually once got kicked in the face for cursing out a passerby who said something along the lines of \"you shouldnt have that dog, you can't take care of it\" to one of my train hopping friends.",

Basically homeless people\u2019s pets are almost always ideal body composition, whereas upwards of 55% of pets in homes are overweight or obese. They receive constant attention, as opposed to being left alone for a good part of everyday, and often exhibit better socialization behaviours. \n\nAlso\u2014Providing care for homeless people\u2019s pets is one of the easiest gateways for being able to get that vulnerable sector to seek out services for themselves. Having pets decreases drug use and suicide rates within the homeless or improperly housed sector. \n\nI\u2019ll look for mini docs/info from the two projects the local university was involved in when I\u2019m at work today.\n\nEdit.

I asked him if this was true because I\u2019ll go into the store and buy a few cans for the dog. He said that he swore on the dog. I went in and bought a bag full of cans and the cheapest bag, some hot dog buns, and 88 cent hot dog franks for him . I still remember the guy breaking down in tears. He couldn\u2019t care less I bought him food. He kept thanking me for buying the dog food. I realized that it\u2019s all he honestly had in his life. He probably would give his life for the dog because it was... I assume his only companion in life.",

Cause Animale Nord never confirmed the puppy was indeed drugged, despite being requested for evidence various times, which led to viewers believing the puppy wasn't drugged based on its behavior in the video.\n\nPuppy deftly wasn't drugged and they are just shitty ppl",

Dahmer arrived and attempted to take the boy with him but he was stopped by the women. But when the police arrived, they accepted Dahmer\u2019s claim that the boy was his boyfriend and was simply drunk. They escorted Dahmer and the boy back to Dahmer\u2019s house and even stepped inside for a moment before leaving.  \n  \nDahmer subsequently murdered the boy and went on to murder three more time before he was caught. After he was caught, the police officers were fired for gross incompetence:  \n* They allowed Dahmer to take a naked, incoherent underage boy who was bleeding from his buttocks.  \n* They failed to perform even the most basic check on Dahmer, which would immediately have revealed Dahmer to be a convicted child molester.  \n* Despite entering Dahmer\u2019s house they failed to notice the rotting corpse of Dahmer\u2019s most recent victim that Dahmer was storing there, even though they did notice the smell.\n  \n**The officers then sued for wrongful termination, won their case and were reinstated. One of them went on to become president of the local police association.**",

No police in my town of 1000 but a town of 120,000 20 miles away had coverage.  I told them to hurry because the guy was aggressive. He was telling my 140 pound dog to shut the fuck up while fiddling with the door to pick the lock. Who knows what his plan was when he got through that door. \n\nHe went back and forth between two rear doors I\u2019m guessing to see which was easier to open. I told the 9-11 operator that he was pushing on the doors now and was going to break one down and if he did I had a .45 aimed at his chest. They told me to go to the safest room in my house. I\u2019m, thinking \u201cI\u2019m not Jodie fucking Foster. There is no panic room in my house.\u201d So I said, \u201cthe front doors are the most secure door in my house. I also have no idea where he is when I\u2019m behind my bedroom door with my wife. \n\nAfter a long standoff they told me police were near and the guy miraculously walked off. My neighbor was on the phone with my wife the whole time and he watched where the guy was going. Police showed up, I quickly explained that I was on the phone with someone across the street who is watching him walk off so they should take my phone and go get him. They proceeded to ask me questions for 3 minutes while my neighbor told me that he was going into a slow jog and getting further away and then turning a block and ultimately losing sight of him.

They couldn\u2019t send anyone right out because they only had a couple officers on duty that night and they were tied up with a previous call. My dad was on his way home from work while this was going on and actually sped home hoping to get a police officer to chase him so he could bring them to the house. Nope. No luck. However when my dad came home the police FINALLY showed up. It turns out it was just some chick high out of her mind looking for drugs and got our house mixed up with the house next door, luckily.",

I also did this when I was little, but I unplugged the receiver to practice dialing it with my eyes closed (my teacher wanted us to). I didn't realize, however, that unplugging the receiver didn't disconnect the phone, so I successfully dialed 911 about 10 times and hung up. That didn't go over well, and the cop was a dick about it when he came by.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlso, when I was 7-8 I got curious and pulled the fire alarm in our condo complex (110 units). I ran up to my unit and my family was rushing to get my little sister out of the bath and get outside. I didn't tell anyone, and while ~200 people vacated outside in the parking lot waiting for the fire department, I locked myself in our bathroom waiting for the inevitable. Which came, because the alarm I pulled was in the front lobby, right in front of the main camera. \n  \n\nI got in more trouble for that. \n\n\nEDIT: I was a dumb kid.",

So one day in the new apartment I poked myself in the eye and immediately called 911. In fact I just remember calling multiple times. 2 officers came out and my family was confused so when I stumbled to the door like the smart yet moronic toddler I was, I told the cops it was me and I said \u201cI poked myself in the eye, *LIKE THIS*!\u201d And proceeded to poke myself in the fucking eye lmao. They thought it was cute but also talked to my brother and I about not calling the cops unless for emergency. They remembered my family from the house fire a couple months earlier so they weren\u2019t upset, plus we were the talk of the town (very small borough) because of how my brother and I looked like twins yet weren\u2019t.\n\n*edit* a word",

Sharon Nichols was the 45 year old 911 operator. [She was found guilty of willful neglect of duty, a misdemeanor](https://www.google.com/amp/www.spokesman.com/stories/2008/jan/19/911-operator-convicted-dismissed-call-as-a-prank/%3famp-content=amp). [She lost her job and was sentenced to one year of probation, 100 hours of community service and $450 in fines and court costs](https://psc.apcointl.org/2012/01/11/dispatchers-seek-suit-dismissals-in-boys-9-1-1-call/).\n\nSo Fieger (Kevorkian\u2019s lawyer) grouped this case with [another, very similar instance of 911 operator fuckery](http://www.wistv.com/story/4755466/wounded-woman-says-detroit-dispatchers-didnt-believe-her-911-calls) and attempted to sue the city for 1 million in damages. \n\nThe [Michigan Supreme Court chose to decline deciding the case in 2008](https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/michigan/miedce/2:2008cv10732/227923/27/0.pdf?ts=1376984049) after being briefed and hearing arguments from each side. They determined there was no affirmative duty to send the police.\n\n[The lawsuit against the operators was then dismissed in 2012](https://courts.michigan.gov/Courts/MichiganSupremeCourt/Clerks/RecentCourtOrders/11-12-Orders/142438%202012-01-20%20or.pdf).\n\nAfter Nichols served her one year probationary term, she was placed back on the job as a 911 operator.",

I had a terrible abscess in my tooth that was some of the worst pain that i ever had(only second to gall bladder attacks). This was well over ten years ago, i had no family or friends and i lived in the sticks, so no bus or uber and i didnt have the money for a taxi.\n\n\n\n\nI couldn't take the pain and called 911 for ambulance. The pain was incredible and i was getting numb on whatever side the abscess was on which ultimately lead to calling. The operator was annoyed, even though i explained the situation and numbness and she asked \"You want me to send you an ambulance.... For a tooth ache? No.\" i said ok and hung up. Had no idea they weren't allowed to do that. I dealt with the pain that day and for a few years until i used my taxes one year to pay the $600 bucks to get it taken out.\n\n\n\n\n\nDental pain is no joke. Whenever i read stories like this, I wonder how many others have been denied ambulance. Sadly, back then, smart phones were rarely available and computers were only for the rich and i was poor as dirt back then so i could not even research what was going on with me or what 911 operator procedures are.",

He was trying to brave it out, but eventually my mum went to his house and decided that something was real wrong with the situation, and that he needed medical attention. She called an ambulance, the ambulance came over, they assessed the situation, and they concluded that whatever the situation was it wasnt urgent, and that they would leave without him. My mum argued with them for ten minutes, but they wouldn't budge and said that if she wanted him to have medical care she'd have to drive him to the hospital herself.\n\nSo, she drove him to the hospital and it turns out his appendix had burst. From what I know, a burst appendix requires surgery, it's time sensitive, and it can be fatal. So yeah, fuck those ambulance dudes.",

THAT IS A HIT AND RUN.\n\nand im like lady, really? if i run over a snake is that also a hit and run? are there weight qualifications for random animals that i am not aware of? i start asking a lot of questions like this and she just hangs up on me\n\nit was weird as fuck. i was just trying to let her know where it was so they can move it if it was dead. why the fuck would she think i committed a crime my driving off? this is why people don't like to call 911. they get accused of a crime when trying to be a good Samaritan.",

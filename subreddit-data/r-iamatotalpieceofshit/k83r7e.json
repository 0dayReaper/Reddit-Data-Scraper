What she is going through is unfortunately not unique and not a fluke - hospital capacities are incredibly high all over the country and if you don't know about patient ratios you should look up what they are in your state. Nurses in many states (like mine) are facing layoffs AND have to deal with incredibly high ratios on a regular basis (which puts them at risk of losing their license if they seriously mess up). Support legislation that benefits nurses, from hospital management reforms to financial benefits for frontline workers. Thank you all again :)",

The first 3 months or so are a real uphill battle and I think that's where a lot of people call it quits before they can see the results of Tretinoin.\n\nPersonally, I still get acne, but I have noticed it disappears after a day or two with Tretinoin. I can also use a very mild cleanser once a day alongside petrolatum as a nighttime moisturiser after my shower. The only other things I can suggest is to use sunscreen regularly, particularly while your skin is adjusting, and to only apply Tretinoin on skin that isn't wet.",

For all this time I could not vote for a Republican because of their stand.  \n\nI am old... and I am a registered Republican.

They want to bring the world back to how it was 70 years ago, and that just is not possible. Conservatism, on the other hand, could work rather well, if and when we are out of the woods with climate change and global warming and other existential problems. For now, however, liberalism is the only path to prevent humankind from dying out.",

My wife is undergoing chemo right now, so COVID would likely be incredibly serious if not fatal if she caught it... And seemingly everywhere I turn, someone without a mask is standing too close.

Let us be a warning to the world that it isn't just old religion stories that can detach people from nature and truth, but TV channels (Fox News), and social media. Religion stories are pretty boring compared to modern sports and entertainment, and people seem outright entertained by the denial nonsense.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*We like to think of ourselves as immune from influence or our cognitive biases, because we want to feel like we are in control, but industries like alcohol, tobacco, fast food, and gaming all know we are creatures that are subject to cognitive and emotional vulnerabilities. And tech has caught on to this with its research into \u201cuser experience,\u201d \u201cgamification,\u201d \u201cgrowth hacking,\u201d and \u201cengagement\u201d by activating ludic loops and reinforcement schedules in the same way slot machines do. So far, this gamification has been contained to social media and digital platforms, but what will happen as we further integrate our lives with networked information architectures designed to exploit evolutionary flaws in our cognition? Do we really want to live in a \u201cgamified\u201d environment that engineers our obsessions and plays with our lives as if we are inside its game?*\n\u2015 Christopher Wylie, Mindf*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America",

But it was old age that meant that heart didn't have as much juice or they didn't move around enough to avoid bed sores, etc. It is not dishonest to say it was old age that killed someone, even if it wasn't the *specific* reason. If pneumonia absolutely wrecks havoc on a person's lungs to the point that allergies kill them, it was the pneumonia, not the otherwise survivable allergies, which brought about their death.\n\nSimilarly, COVID kicks the ass of a good many people that get it. If, while they're down, something else further kicks their ass enough that it ends them when it would not have were it not for being compromised by COVID, they still died of COVID. Thats what created the condition that killed them.\n\nCOVID doesn't kill everyone it encounters, but it is an absolute death sentence to many people (many otherwise healthy and in their 20s, just lacking a protein that would properly alert their body to a threat this big, early enough), and it's those people we are trying not to have die.",

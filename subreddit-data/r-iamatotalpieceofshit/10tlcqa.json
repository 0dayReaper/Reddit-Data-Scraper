We used a 3/4 carat diamond from my great great grandmother so it had two generations in my family already. I was worried she would hate it. He tricked me by having it in a tray of rings she was trying on. Loved it. So I slipped it in my pocket as we left and asked her the next night. We celebrate 35 years next month.",

I know that my partner knows me well enough to choose something I'd love. I trust him to think about what I would like when choosing a ring. So I  understand that the thought behind choosing a ring that your partner actually likes is important.\n\nBut this b!tch?!! Vile. Just vile.\n\nThis ring is pretty, maybe a little basic by some people's standards, but it's not hideous by any means. It's a classy, timeless style ring that anyone could wear and pull off. \n\nI've really felt bad for some ladies who will say something like \"I feel as though he hasn't considered what I like when buying the ring and I'm upset about it. It's the opposite of my usual style\" or others who are like \"this ring is really impractical for my job, the stone is too raised and will get caught on everything and I'll eventually break it. I feel as though he didn't think about this suiting my lifestyle at all\". I guess that's because there's an element of the thought behind it not being fully there.\n\nThey get obliterated because, according to reddit, any woman should be grateful for any ring. But you're right, it is the thought behind it that matters, and part of that thought is to get a ring that suits your partner.\n\nThat said, this woman is just awful. She's talking SO disrespectfully about it!! I'm appalled by her.",

It's a quite modern thing to replace and upgrade. \n\nI remember how utterly taboo the concept of changing your engagement/wedding ring was for my parents and grandparents generations. My grandparents caused quite the stir when my grandfather updated my grandmothers rings *for their **40th** wedding anniversary* (he got her a Ruby ring. She'd always loved rubies, so that's how he honoured their Ruby anniversary). They were the talk of the town, it was scandalous! \n\nAnd even if it's not for the rest of your life, you'd still hope that the person you're going to spend your life with would know what kind of style you like/dislike and what is practical for your job/life. \n\nIt's the thought that counts is such a strange phrase in this circumstance because it can go both ways. The thought of him wanting to propose is so lovely, but putting the thought in to the type of ring that's suitable also matters.\n\nI still think the OOP in this case is awful though. This isn't some out-there outlandishly ugly or impractical ring. I'm in the FB group and I've seen some things. The \"ewwwwwwww\" is so, so disrespectful.",

I was very clear that I wanted a hard stone that would not break or chip, because if I had to replace my ring, it 100% would not be the same, to me.\n\nIt could have something to do with the metal, too. If all her other jewelry is gold, and gold looks better on her skin, I can see being upset that the ring is silver, if she already told him. I only wear rose gold, because the other metals don\u2019t look as good.",

I switched it to my right hand when we got married and upgraded. In fact, though I don't wear it, I still have that one, though the upgrade and wedding band were sold to pay for the divorce.\n\nMy current partner plans to propose this year and he knows I'd want it to be the ring I wear for life.\n\nYou're right about the type of metal and skin tone too. I can only wear silver, white gold or platinum. Yellow and rose gold look awful on me, which is such a shame because I think Rose gold is so very pretty. It's just not pretty on me.",

The offenders will down vote you but you're still right. \n\nExactly, to me that ring is ugly and apparently to her as well! I wish I knew then what I know now. When my husband gave me a ridiculously large solitaire as an engagement ring I of course accepted it because I love him but the ring looks awful on my small hands and I never wore it beyond the engagement and even then only sparingly.\n\nThe only jewelry I wear are small stones, especially in my rings because I don't like gaudy jewelry. I don't know what he was thinking buying this because I never asked but I know that he noticed because he never bought me anything with large stones like this again. \n\nAnd for all the people here trashing her, she says he needs to buy something different, not something bigger. Saying she should be grateful for something that she's going to want to wear on her hand for much of her life is ignorant and arrogant IMO. What if they picked out each other's wedding bands and she picked out white gold with a ruby heart stone for him, should he be grateful for that? If that's not his style he shouldn't be and she shouldn't be 'grateful' for this ugly ass ring either. Rejecting the ring is in no way rejecting him, it's just a ring, it's not the relationship, stop getting butt hurt.",

And these people shouldnt be allowed to purchase pets. \n\nHowever in the cases where the animal was consenting(still horrendous) i dont understand tax payers paying to put someone in prison for a decade. This women will come out a criminal and probably end up back in the system. Because she laid there and took it from an animal ready to give. \n\nI can't stress how much this stuff disgusts me and should still be a punished crime. But a prison sentence worse than murders is unjustifiable to me. Id almost be on board if a man pentrated a dog. Maybe im wrong for the unbalanced view. But its crazy that a woman gets 10 years for a dog getting its rocks off. Legs have been getting molested for years with giggles. Coochie...straight to jail",

Her actual name was Amy Lew, a 20 yr old white female who was charged with 2 misdemeanor counts of Lewd and lascivious behavior as well as 3 misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct.\n\nShe's infamous for her yt video of \"10 Reasons why you should have s-- with dogs\". In the video, it shows her sitting on what seems to be her bathroom floor while she pets her German shepherd. I have not watched the full video, but you could probably find it on yt. \n\nSometime earlier before this video I assume, it was found out that her boyfriend, Erio Oliver (16), was arrested for being in possession of CP of I think him and Amy. Which onto why Amy was arrested was because allegedly, it was her idea to film these videos with Erio. What makes this worse is they would film it in public businesses.\n\nAnd from what I heard, she also recorded beastiality. But this is all I know from a quick search and this information may not be correct either. Anyone who sees this reply, feel free to correct me or add on to this information.",

Save the prison time for the major offenders like rapists and pedophiles and with them throw away the key.\n\nGonna be interesting to see exactly what the judge lands on.

If a man has sex with a dog I would understand the jailtime since the penetration would legit harm the dog and might even cause it do die, but if it's a woman there's no harm being done to the dog. Dog is probably happy it got to stick it's tiny penis in some hole. Why the jailtime?",

I also think there\u2019s a big difference between fucking an animal that cannot consent with humans and killing them for food and distribution. They\u2019re so different they shouldn\u2019t even be compared. \n\nAlso most people aren\u2019t up in arms and throwing riots. They all just agree that it\u2019s weird and shouldn\u2019t be allowed in society. That\u2019s it, no extreme emotions required especially since, like you said, it\u2019s not a high priority issue. You think it\u2019s an own but I\u2019d wager most if not all would agree with that assertion.",

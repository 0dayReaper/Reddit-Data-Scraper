We have a pit mix and, while she\u2019s strong as hell, she\u2019s the absolute sweetest dog you\u2019ll ever meet, no exaggeration. These dogs are natural bulls and it is heart breaking when someone doesn\u2019t try to reign them in when they all need reigning in. A lot of pits being aggressive is pretty accurate but it is 100% up to the owner to take responsibility and train them properly if they decide to bring one into their lives\u2026.\n\nEdit: read the comments. Just to clarify, this isn\u2019t a \u201cmy child would never!-\u201c situation. I explain my reasoning under another comment but to generalize it. I can handle my dog, easily, I am very capable of restraining her, even though 99% of the time she\u2019d roll on her back and beg for tummy rubs, but pits ARE dangerous especially in the wrong/ irresponsible hands. I also agree with the comments saying we need to breed the pit trait out of dogs through generations so we don\u2019t have one group with ample naturally aggressive instinct. It just sucks for the dogs who are always morally neutral in these situations and literally have no idea what\u2019s going on",

I\u2019m not even defending pit bulls as a breed, they ARE dangerous. It\u2019s like a gun imo (politics aside). Guns were made to cause harm (pit bulls were bred to fight) when owned by the wrong person or in the wrong hands, someone gets hurt and possibly killed. I don\u2019t take offense to them saying the breed needs to end, I actually agree with them in the sense that we should gradually let the pit gene become less and less through generations of dogs, so innocent animals (even dangerous) don\u2019t suffer for being animals. In the end, a lot of dog attacks are by pit bulls and it makes it very hard to not understand someone who sees a pitbull and thinks \u201cdangerous\u201d cuz the statistics are there for the most part.",

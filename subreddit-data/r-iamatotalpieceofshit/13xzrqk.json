People who lack accountability and people who do not learn from punishments or negative consequences. \n\nA major problem is people thinking that calling the cops each time a person breaches the order will fix it. But no. The victim has to file a police report, breach of DVO. This makes the perpetrator have to stand in front of a magistrate and explain their behaviour. Sometimes this happens several times before any incarceration but a single breach will be enough to escalate the conditions. And stalking can go hand in hand with DV, which stalking is attracting a lot of new research about the dangers. \n\nSo if you are a victim and you are still experiencing DV, you need to file a report so that the perpetrator goes to court.",

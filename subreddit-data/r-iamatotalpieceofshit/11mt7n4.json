Just before that, after the first simulation runs to which they were all waiting to see if anyone actually blew up, the animation of simulations go into hyperdrive. On the bottom left screens, you\u2019ll see below I pasted them.

Causing them to feel less in society. Even the people in the family are taught if their siblings are darker they are less than they are. That\u2019s a different level discrimination. \n\nThe religious one at least you can jump ship or denounce or move or simply have a protection from others like you.",

It\u2019s based on professions.\n\nWhat you\u2019re talking about is colourism which is a separate problem Indians face. \n\nPer your example yes the sibling with the darker skin tone will face more discrimination but based on colourism. \n\n2 siblings with the same surname will not face different levels of caste based discrimination. Everyone\u2019s castes can be determined based on their surname. See that\u2019s the insidiousness of the system. It is baked into your very identity on the most basic level. That\u2019s where the problem is and that\u2019s why it is so hard to escape from it.",

The previous government was rocked by corruption scandals and messed up the economy to the point the whole country came to a standstill. Inflation was in double digits and anti incumbency was all time high.\n\nBJP came with a promise of ushering economic development. Now if you ask me, they fell way short of their targets, but they are the only capitalist friendly party in India. For a nation that's teeming with poverty, it was a necessity back then.\n\nEven today, they win because the opposition is in shambles, thanks to their dynastic politics. BJP maybe nationalist, but it allows for their party workers to rise above the ranks irrespective of their background, hence promotes more savvy and cutthroat leaders ( Modi is a backward caste chaiwala before he joined nationalist politics and rose in the ranks)",

Most indian voters are nomadic in a sense.\nCase in point, Delhi, BJP won all 7 parliamentary seats but in state elections it got 3/70. 67 seats were won by a party which very strongly positions itself opposite to BJP in ideology.

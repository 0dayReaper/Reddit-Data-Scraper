Maline said jury instructions required the jury to find that McCarthy had been lawfully performing her duties at the time of the attack, and he argued that she wasn't acting lawfully.\n\n\"You can't detain somebody because you want to do an investigation,\" said Maline. \"The jury instruction that the court read to the jury said if you want to detain somebody, you have to have a reasonable suspicion that they're engaged in criminal activity.\"",

Deputy detained the son, but not the mom, went to pat him down, he fought her and all that other stuff.\n\nBasically, the defense argued that a Terry frisk is only permissible when there is reasonable suspicion that someone is armed.  The deputy said she didn't think he had a weapon, but wanted to detain and frisk him for \"officer safety\".  The jury agreed with the supreme court on the legality of the terry frisk, which in turn led to the force the officer used to detain him for refusing the frisk as unlawful.  Everything else after that the defense successfully convinced the jury was self-defebse from the deputy's unlawful force",

You still have people believing erroneous things like you have to be read your Miranda rights when you're arrested, or a cop has to tell you why they pulled you over, or that cops can stop and frisk anyone they want or that a 911 report alone can establish reasonable suspicion.

Important part here:\n\n&gt;California State Assemblyman Bill Essayli, R-Riverside, a former federal prosecutor and deputy district attorney in nearby Riverside County, said the case should have had enough evidence to secure a conviction \u2014 and that there may have been anti-police bias in the jury.\n\n&gt;\"[The defense] argued that she didn't have a lawful authority to detain him, and therefore, he's free to defend himself and do whatever he wants to get away from her, including beating her up and shooting at her,\" Essayli told Fox News Digital. \"That's not correct. That's not the law. And I don't think the judge should have allowed that argument to be presented in that manner.\"\n\nI agree with the defense. Unlawful detainment should be treated as kidnapping and citizens should be able to defend themselves with the highest level of force necessary. Thank God the jury agreed. This case may be grey but the precedent it would set isn't.",

But if a citizen tried to illegally detain a police officer and the officer fought back and shot the citizen there is zero chance a case like that would have ever seen the inside of a courthouse.  \n\nI see this as jury nullification.

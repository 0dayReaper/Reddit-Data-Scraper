No wonder trust in mainstream media is at rock bottom. Literal propaganda to reduce popularity without any good reason. Nothing wrong with him asking Alphabet to demand more layoffs, a fund manager and public company's literal religion is to maximise profit, and jobs are not bloody charity. Grow up.",

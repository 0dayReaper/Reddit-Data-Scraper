In this case, the car owner would not be suing the officer on the grounds the search was illegal, he would be suing the officer for willfully caussing unnessesary damage during a legal search. That is a potential violation of his statutory rights.\n\nThe judgement would come down to weather a reasonable police officer would have found it necessary to damage the property during a legal search, or a search a reasonable police officer would have thought was legal. The cops can get away with a lot of damage when executing a warrant: breaking down doors, opening walls, dumping drawers, etc. If the damage were from opening the door the first time, the judge would rule pretty quickly that QI applies. I can't see how the judge could make that ruling after seeing the video. No reasonable government official would say that officer had to open the door in that manner to complete the search.",

If the City Officers committed the acts alleged, their actions were morally reprehensible. Not all conduct that is improper or morally wrong, however, violates the Constitution. Because Appellants did not have a clearly established Fourth or Fourteenth Amendment right to be free from the theft of property seized pursuant to a warrant, the City Officers are entitled to qualified immunity.\"  The Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal.",

All my critical data backs up there.\n\nIt would take hours to locate, and that's after someone has realized there's a device on the network they can't account for. Given the number of devices I have around, it could take them days to know to look.

I don't if what OP claims is true).\n\nIn the case of Blink, it appears that their programming only requires that special token for some types of access to your account. So OP says that it is required to view/download video (this is good), but not to arm/disarm the system (if true, this is incredibly bad).\n\nI urge you to do your own due diligence, but if what OP says is true, I wouldn't trust Blink to secure garbage cans, let alone my house.",

The battery charge lasts a few weeks depending on how often they get activated. You can also get alerts on your phone according to how you set it up. It can even detect differences between people, animals, and cars. They are worth every penny.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the award stranger. \n\nAdding: Everyone should have some sort of home security camera system these days. At minimum, get a doorbell camera to watch over package deliveries. The worst feeling is having someone steal from you and having ZERO video footage to show police. It only took myself one time before I bought a few cameras.",

At the end of the search we ask the owner to go through the house to check for any damage. If they are happy that no damage has been caused, they signthe book.\n\nOne time a colleague did the paperwork. The owners were happy that no damage had been caused. He stood up to pass the booklet for signing, put his head straight into this low hanging chandelier smashing it to pieces. To be fair to them, the owners foundit funny too. They were paid for the accidental damage.",

What country is this, did they have a warrant?\n\nAround here they can't enter a home without a warrant, and a home search warrant requires an ongoing investigation. So smoking weed at your own house is regarded as a legal grey area (sort of) here, because even though it's technically illegal, cops can do nothing about it, unless they start a full scale investigation, which unless they have very strong suspicions that you are dealing drugs, it's not going to happen because it's just not worth the resources.\n\nSo if the neighbour or someone calls the police on you for smoking weed, they'll show up (as they have to for any report/call), give you a ring and inform you of the complaint, maybe give you a few stern words or try to scare you a bit, but there's nothing else they can do.",

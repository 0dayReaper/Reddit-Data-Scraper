Also get a \"rib rubber\" end cap and learn how to use that too.\n\nI was watching a bar fight outside once and a dude jumped on my back. I wasn't expecting it so I fell forward and he slid over my head and we were both on all fours, think human centipede position. I went to deliver a hay maker to the nuts and landed quite possible the hardest punch I've ever thrown about 2\" north of the target and planted it right to his dirt tulip. I'll never forget the noise he made. All of the fight he had in him was gone.",

Still abusive af but it explains why he felt so comfortable acting that way around them.\n\nEdit: I just realized this isn\u2019t the full video. The full video was posted before and for a few seconds the mother approaches the man after he already attacked so she could speak with him.",

In this kind of situation, most people who see this think that the woman is the mother and the man tries to kidnap the child.. but I've heard some stories about the opposite where fathers get thier children stolen by women who pretend they're the mothers.. and the woman is believed all the time. Even if the man was aggressive, idk who's in the wrong here until I know the story behind it.",

This is related to the Bystander Effect. Also, anyone that has taken public transportation in a major city can attest to this. Fights/sexual groping/robberies happen often and happen often without bystanders intervening. \n\nTbh your comment feels a bit jaded, and unrealistic. Just because someone defends themselves from a black person doesn\u2019t mean they will get charged with a \u201chate crime\u201d. You sound like someone who believes in white replacement theory",

It\u2019s on the media 24/7 all the time. It\u2019s called not being blind to what the media always shows us and tells us. If you hurt the kid by trying to stop him it definitely would have been a hate crime. Secondly, like others have said. Who knows if he had a gun, a knife, or anything else.",

You and the other commenter are the ones implying that because he\u2019s black he\u2019s immune from the law \n\n&gt;you can beat a minor because he sprayed a fire extinguisher \n\nWell considering the fact that he sprayed directly at the baby, this can definitely be defined as intending to do harm. Idk if you know this, but babies shouldn\u2019t breath in foam from a fire extinguisher. This can lead to sickness or worse. Not to mentioning spraying the foam at anyone can be a choking hazard.\n\nCan videos be manipulated/seen out of context, sure, but I highly doubt that with this video evidence and all the witnesses around this would be considered a hate crime. That\u2019s not why people didn\u2019t intervene. It\u2019s because of the bystander effect, nothing to do with being afraid of charged with a hate crime. That\u2019s a ridiculous theory/thought.\n\nAlso not to mention, if someone is willing to do this to a bunch of strangers especially at a young age, that person is unhinged and potentially dangerous.",

She had lied, gaslit him, manipulated him, tried to make him feel lesser, and would constantly hit him. It's not like he could do it back since he's a much larger person than she was. The evidence in court against my brother was he owned a gun and she felt \"unsafe\" because of that. Not because he would hurt her or himself. Just the fact that he owned them.\n\nNot all judges pay attention and care. Many already have a predisposition on how they'll side, and odds are a judge isn't gonna side with a 5'8 220lb man when a 5ft 100lb woman is saying she feels threatened. Trust me.

It was her third violation, so it was a felony with jail time.  During the trial, it was clear the guy was playing her.\n\nOriginal order - they got into a fight the day she came home after a C-section.   She then proceeded to go into their apartment and took her clothes and the baby\u2019s things.  Of course, she\u2019s not allowed to enter the premises - even if he\u2019s not there.  She pled guilty.  (Strike 1).\n\n2 years later, she comes home from the hospital after a C-Section.  They get into a fight, so he drops a dime on her.  She pleads guilty.  (Strike 2).  Of course, no one quite understood how she got pregnant or had come to live in the apartment\u2026\u2026.(was mentioned in deliberations).\n\n18 months later.  He\u2019s got a new gal, she\u2019s got a new guy.  New guy tends bar at a popular nightspot.  He knows she hangs out there every Friday while new guy tends bar.  He intentionally goes there with his new girl and new girl\u2019s friend..  Of course, she has to leave.  So he, new girl, and new girl\u2019s friend follow her out and chaos ensues, and by chaos, I mean a street brawl which ended where she got stripped naked on the street.  Of course, she gets arrested for violating the OP.    Felony 3rd offense with jail time - she\u2019s not pleading this time.\n\nThere were 7 women and 4 fathers on the jury - so there was no way she was getting convicted.  When they mentioned the C-Section the first time, every woman on the jury was like - WTF.  The dads all knew better.   It took us 20 minutes - and that\u2019s because the guy that didn\u2019t have kids?  Yeah, he tried to commit suicide and had 7 women trying to help him.  He wanted to go over the \u201cmerits\u201d of the case.",

I would also like to point out there are different ways one could phrase what they think, for example one could say \"I personally don't like your wedding dress\" instead of using profanity would be better, but still one has the right to free speech...

The problem with not being able to argue and have religious expression is that this same religion comes hand in hand with certain scientific and political ideologies most of the time because its is strongly embedded in our culture! It is not something that we can just avoid or silence its something we need to face and deal with in the best means possible.",

What is this point? God is referred to in a male capacity. \"His image\" means his nature of holy, not appearance. What you're engaging in is Presentism. It's a fallacy that consists of reading ancient texts with modern goggles on. A common hermeneutic fallacy is assuming that the issues that are important to modern society were important to our ancestors. \n\n&gt;Hens it could be argued that god is trans.\n\nJust... no.\n\n&gt; those conservative types who tend to be absolute haters.\n\nHow are they simply \"haters\", lmao?

Do you honestly think any of this has to do with any real legit study of the bible?  I have studied religious interpretation some time ago. So, tell me that no one takes the bible literally especially now a days.  My issue is with people not the scripture.  The idea is to poke at folk who misinterpret the bible for their own sake, the type that will hate on someone long before putting any real thought into something.  \n\nThese folks will not do what you did now, they will not bring up real analysis to argue.  This kind of thing isn't meant for you.  That and why defend such folk, wouldn't you rather see real Christians who actually understand faith properly represent the religion instead of the types who take it for granted.  The types who let the \"big brain\" do all the thinking.",

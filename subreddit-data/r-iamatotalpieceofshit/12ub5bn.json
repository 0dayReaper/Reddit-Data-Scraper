The min the kid came in he brought it back in as a case. The point is because they eradicated it the measles will cause minimum damage and not affect people as much as they would have if they were unvaccinated. \n\nAlso the descent thing for the parents to have done is to make sure they got all the preflight jabs. Guessing they lied before flying because you are always asked.",

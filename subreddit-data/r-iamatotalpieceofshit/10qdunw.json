Same with cartoons, you didn\u2019t see most kids trying to do the things Bugs Bunny did to Elmer, because not many related to Bugs Bunny due to him being a caricature (of a rabbit). \n\nBut many relate to real people, the people on YouTube, Tik Tok and Twitter etc\u2026they\u2019re just like you and doing things that you could do, like open food products and lick them, jump of a roof (wrestling stunts, parkour etc). So they copy other people to be famous like them, or even make money doing nonsense like this.",

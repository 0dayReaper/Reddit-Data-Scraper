But a big body movement like standing to face her, or speaking, are both things that can be really difficult if you\u2019re overstimulated or under high stress. \n\nI don\u2019t think this was him trying to subdue the situation, I think this was him trying his best to cope in a situation no one is equipped to handle, and shutting down to avoid that overwhelm.",

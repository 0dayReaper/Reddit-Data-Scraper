We're gonna need 250 big Macs, 250 10 piece chicken nuggets, 250 fries, and what the hell, throw in some apple pies too.   \n\nMcds:. Umm. Okay.

Platforms such as 4chan and even our dear Reddit have the potential (and often successfully) spread mis and disinformation, however with TikTok, people can literally post and say anything they want with often dangerous information that attracts many younger viewers that lack the know-how or will to verify what they are seeing/hearing. And it doesn't appear to have as much user engagement to call people put on their BS like can be done easier on platforms such as reddit.",

Even if they were found not guilty the first time. Just the prior accusation can be evidence in a subsequent trial.",

A legalistic death sentence has been used since the first civilizations created in Mesopotamia and has been consistently used throughout the world, even today. When you break the social contract *so severely* you forfeit your right to live in such society. This isn't some new or novel concept. It simply comes with the territory of living in civilization.\nWhat's evil is allowing murders, rapists, and kidnappers to run loose in your city. Call it a small sin to prevent the complete degradation of your society.",

Pfizer (pharmaceutical company) pulled it a while back and basically stole the property of over a hundred people and ended up not doing anything with the property. All of those family homes basically got destroyed for no reason. Rich people can get away with anything.\n\nEdit:\nThe Pfizer case is called Kelo v. City of New London (2005). The case went to the Supreme Court and the court decided the eminent domain was legal. This set precedent which basically makes eminent domain a whole lot easier for major corporations and affluent people.",

The image here is accurate, but the actual story is even worse.\n\nThe ranger (Robert Danno) who raised concerns got reassigned to desk duty, disciplined for meaningless shit, and then reassigned again to a location 2 hours away. Then he filed a whistleblower complaint, which is supposed to be anonymous, but it basically wasn't. He got demoted after that. His boss then accused him of theft, so the feds raided his home since he was classified as a threat to the public and himself. After it went to jury, he got acquitted after a few minutes (because the charges were again BS).\n\nDanno eventually settled and got his job back on the condition he moved from Maryland to Montana. Also, employee morale dropped heavily in the National Park Service.\n\n&gt;Danno insists he\u2019s not angry about what happened. He just wants to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. \u201cEssentially, all Dan Snyder did was ask,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was our job to turn him down.\u201d Snyder, for his part, has never apologized for the trouble he caused others by cutting down those trees. A local realtor, however, estimated that the unobstructed view of the river has added hundreds of thousands of dollars to the value of his estate.  \n\nNobody at the NPS got in any trouble with what happened though.",

The beach is public and they (rich people group) are trying(at the time of the article) to make it private. Yet, cops were already removing people from the public beach? That land at least until they donate to some judges campaign funds for a favorable ruling belongs to everyone, to all of us, it is fucking public. It is your land as much as it is mine or his and this dude owning a beach front property isn\u2019t enough he wants the beach and I bet the water out to 400m too. Just never ends.",

For example, I don\u2019t look at a forest and wonder how it would be more beautiful if I cut down the trees to have an extra tennis court and a view of whatever is beyond the trees. I don\u2019t look at the ocean I\u2019m in awe of and feel like I need a giant yacht to enjoy its beauty. Us normal folk appreciate what is here versus what we need it to be.

Maybe something like covid changes people and their habits, what do you do with all that money if your stuck at home or just can't live that certain lifestyle. Best escape now and before the virus, at least for me, has been trekking and hiking, walking in the forest, and that costs nothing. The old saying, the best things in life are free, really holds true.\n\nAlso in large parts of the world, in rural areas for example, money doesn't hold quite the same value as in cities and in places where people feel maybe the need to keep a certain appearance. The funny thing is that having that lifestyle of spending money, doing things that require a thick wallet or solid income, is actually limiting you in many ways. You are stuck within that bubble where your wealth gets you something. I believe a lot of wealthy people don't necessarily live that lavishly, maybe they are tired of traveling with an entourage or of all the fake smiles surrounding them. More fulfilling perhaps to chill on a quiet beach with a surfboard or experience the world like an average Joe. Just without the pressure of having to work from 9-5.\n\nMaybe why there's so much wealthy and rich presented in media, is because that lifestyle is pushed to the masses as something to thrive for. But honestly if you spend your time worrying about what other people think about your clothes, car or hair or whatever, and feel the need to look cute in a cocktail party, that's just silly, and in time more and more people will see this. So I hope and believe. \n\nPeople really are selling their time way too cheap, nothing wrong with work, but generations spending their lives to get dollars, just because of the system we are in. The rich really are taking advantage and having a laugh about that. And maybe rightfully so? After all we all have free will. If you're worried about food, learn to fish.\n\nToo long and all over the place, I know..",

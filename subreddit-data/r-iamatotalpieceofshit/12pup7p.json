And tbh the course isn\u2019t even that long I think a few hours, but it teaches how to safely use a firearm and how to properly store your firearms. That alone probably would make a huge difference in a lot of gun accidents you guys have.(I\u2019m not saying this was an accident tho it was a tragedy)",

Gun control doesn't need to mean banning guns, just please ffs have better background checks and make firearm safety courses mandatory. It probably won't eliminate all the nut cases, but it sure will ensure the number of needless deaths comes down. Having so much easy access to go out and purchase guns is exactly the problem. And don't tell me that everybody having to carry guns around even when are out shopping is making anybody feel any safer. That is a powderkeg of disaster waiting for an escalation to happen.",

But at least some ideas:\n\n1) Small guns (small caliber handguns and stuff) = a weapon course including psychological documentation, background check. Bigger guns just for people who need it due to their work.\n\n2) Stop selling guns to people who fail to qualify for step 1 from now on and make it illegal to sell guns privatly.\n\n3) Make it mandatory bring your guns once in a while to your gun dealership, to make sure people still own their own guns. Broken guns have to be disposed at those dealerships. And I don't know anything about how you are supposed to store your weapons at home, but at least here in Germany you are in huge trouble, if store it outside a locked safe, which decreases the amount of children being killed by accident to almost (I think it's actualy) zero.\n\nOf course there are huge demographic differences between europe and the us, and the us has a load of things to do.

The size of a gun has NOTHING to do with its safety or use. Reality is that the largest of guns in the US has never been used in crimes. \n3. A 'weapon course' serves no purpose. It does absolutely nothing. People already know guns are dangerous and what they do. You don't teach people not to leave a gun out for a 3 year old to get hands on it. It isn't possible. You can't teach common sense. \n4. Selling guns without a background check is already illegal when buying from a store. \n5. Private sales account for a VERY small fraction of sales. Criminals will also not follow this rule/law. Making it pointless anyways. It would strictly be a law that stops law abiding citizens. On top of this, what exactly would a person do with a gun they no longer want but spent money on? You can't just destroy it or take it. \n6. Bringing guns into a dealer for verification of ownership? This is just NOT reasonable and NOT viable. It would serve to only have a gun shop be able to perform this task and they would charge people to do this. Thus creating the problem of not knowing who has guns because people don't want to pay to just show their gun to a person. Let alone people have to work and this puts significant burdens on them which is unreasonable. \n7. Broken guns have to be disposed of? Guess we throw whole cars out now too? This is just as silly as the last one. \n8. The US already has a mandatory requirement to include a trigger safety with every gun sold. This is a federal law. You also cannot expect a person to spend a thousand dollars on a safe for a gun. It is simply unreasonable and a burden. When a gun costs $500 and the safe costs $1000, this is utterly unreasonable. \n\nIt is clear you have the same issue most everyone for gun control has.

And people not wanting them anymore would have to sell them to gun dealerships. Or need to go through paperwork to register the new owner.\n6. That's my point. They have to bring them to the gun dealership regularly after buying it. Otherwise they'll be fined. To prevent illegal sales \n7.

When the background check already does a good enough job for this. A person with no psychological issues will not have points on record of them. Already solved. Unless your aim is to use your own psychological scale here. Which doesnt work. \n2. You cannot teach a person common sense. It does not work. You might hope it could be but it is NOT possible. Just the same you don't teach a new motorcycle rider about the dangers of their riding. They ride without gear for when they crash. You don't teach people these lessons. \n3. Buying a gun is a FEDERAL issue. States do not get to choose laws on buying firearms. They can restrict the firearms they allow in the state, they cannot however ignore federal laws. You not knowing this already invalidates a vast majority of your arguments.\n4. Criminals not following laws is exactly the point of not having a law. People seem to think that a law is something that costs nothing to enforce. It costs money to enforce a law that will be ignored by 99% of the people it hopes to catch. It is unreasonable and a waste of resources.\n5. Forcing people to sell their guns to shops is unreasonable. This will just create 'gamestop for guns' situations. Paperwork to register the new owner? You mean paperwork that will only matter to the 99.99% of gun owners and cost money for them and be ignored by the people using 0.01% of guns for crimes? Again, unreasonable and a waste of resources. \n6. Guns get repaired or displayed. Not disposed of. Any person tossing a gun out is going to be a criminal. Not a normal gun owner.\n7. Guns are dangerous items. Everyone knows this. As I already said, trigger locks are FEDERALLY required to be included with all guns. A $1000 safe for a gun is unreasonable when a trigger lock exists. And I will tell you. They are not some crap locks. They are good locks. \n\nYou keep suggesting things that are only going to hurt the 99.99% of gun owners who legally have guns and commit no crimes. They do not affect the 0.01% of guns people use in crimes. This is an issue of cost-benefit analysis. It will cost X amount of money from the government, and Y amount of money from gun owners to affect 0% of crimes. The impact is much more likely to affect the sales of guns and the creation of guns at home using equipment like a CNC and lathe. Making the problem of criminals getting guns so much easier and more widespread.",

It's about making it more challenging for just anyone to get a gun and ridiculous amounts of ammo anytime a homicidal whim hits their brainpan. It's about no longer serving the NRA's profit-driven fetishizing of guns. It's managed to make too many people equate a gun with power and freedom -- when at best it's a tool to hunt animals with and at worst the fastest way to massacre innocent people.\n\nI pose a question to you. What *should* be done about the massive amount of gun deaths in America? Do you really honestly believe more guns is the answer?",

School shootings were just becoming a thing when I was finishing highschool, now they are so rapid I imagine these kids grew up with the fear of shootings their whole lives. When I grew up I never once thought of that. No wonder Americans are so distrustful and cynical. I love my American brethren but it saddens me sometimes to see how much fear is running through their country.\n\n I meet a lot of people thst say they come to Canada over usa for one reason only. Safety. Peace of mind.\nI've met people who said it took them years to not tense up around others. Or even sleep without a gun nearby. I tell people I sleep with my doors unlocked LOL.

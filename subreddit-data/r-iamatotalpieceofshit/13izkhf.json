So, then it became a battle of, who has the most time to kill.\n\nI sat blocking her Beemer for about 60 seconds, when I noticed something.  So I got out and approached her car (she already had her windows down, which is why I noticed).\n\n\"What are you doing\"?\n\n(silence, trying hard to look unfazed - and succeeding).\n\n\"Have you even thought to consider that, you're a tiny woman, by yourself (technically), and I'm a 6\u20192\u201c, 250 lb man, who - for all you know - could be a complete psychopath?\"\n\n(continued silence, look is still unfazed, almost bored at this point - she's obviously practiced this look).\n\n\"I wonder though... what does your husband think about you pulling little stunts like this\"?...\n\n(still unfazed)\n\n\"... What's more, I wonder how he would feel knowing you're not only risking your own life, but the lives of his two small children\"?\n\n(Eyes widen... Two seconds go by, then  her car finally goes into reverse, allowing me to finish backing out and pulling away).\n\nThat's what I had noticed: she was pulling her little road rage stunt with her two kids in the car.  I get that you feel self-righteous about these things, Hell, I was no better in this situation... but at least I was by myself.  I was only risking myself, and no one else.\n\nI've changed since this incident and I don't challenge people over stupid crap like this anymore (this happened almost 25 years ago).  These days, I would simply pull back in my spot and let them pass (if you're in that much of a hurry, have at it).",

That's how tells show up. \n\nAs people lie habitually, they also condition their brain to be more comfortable with lying. The discomfort signal stops firing. \n\nPeople who bullshit, speak without care to what is true or false, also are more susceptible to believing bullshit. There's an internal price to one's ability to navigate the world when one chooses to be a liar or lies carelessly. Because our repeated choices shape nueral connections, they are shaping our perception of reality. We can effectively destroy our ability to know the difference between what's true and false. \n\nIts not necessarily a clinical issue or deserving of clinical terminology. Sometimes people just make poor choices.",

It allows them to do whatever they want which is 99% of the time firing the driver. The driver can just get another account though it isn't hard. Same as Uber or Lyft. I know someone that is on their like 8th account now? Hard to even keep track at this point lol. Now that is funny, where people think there is some actual security with these apps and who delivers or drives them places. It is so easy to make new accounts right away and get back to driving it is actually hilarious.",

I dash, and I really don't know how I would handle this... that's literally my lifeline rn... in struggling so hard and the extra money from doordash isn't even enough... if someone was so ready to tear my life apart over $20 worth of food, I really feel that I would lose my mind and do something that I would probably greatly regret later on... \n\nThis is just so low and horrible... I can't understand how people can be so uncaring about the struggles other people go through..... i would give my life to save this world and give every single person all the things they need to have a fulfilling life, if I had the power to do such a thing... and it just blows my mind to see people lack empathy so completely that they are willing to ruin another person's life over a meal.",

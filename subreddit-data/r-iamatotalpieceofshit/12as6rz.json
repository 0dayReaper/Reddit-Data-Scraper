That way only one person needs to observe a video/image, write a description (in the level of detail that can be used in a criminal trial - not something I would want to do) and put the description next to the hash value. \n\nThat way, when they catch someone like this, they grab the hash values for every file on his laptop and check them against the list. Boom. 1,997 known files.\n\nAt some point someone will have to go through the other files to see what they contain and if any new hashes should be added to the catalogue, but for right now they nailed him and nobody had to open the yucky photos.",

A good example of this is if you have a word document and save it. Then get the hash value. If you go back to the word document and remove and extra space at the end and save it again. When you hash the document it now has a different hash value. So visually and functionally they\u2019re the same file but when they are hashed they\u2019re no longer equal. \n\nI know that second bit a bit repetitive of the first bit, but I wanted to show how important such a minute change is. I say this because if criminals do anything to it then the hash value is useless. Such as put a blue dot in the corner and save the file again, it would no longer match.",

It isn't a downside.\n\nIt's also the basis of digital signatures, which ensure a file was not tampered with after a signatory signed it. What you do is hash the file, then encrypt the hash using your private key. This will produce a ciphertext of the hash. Because public/private key encryption is two-way (you encrypt using one side of the key and decrypt using the other), and because everyone knows your public key, they can use your public key to decrypt the hash, hash the document themselves, then compare the two strings. If they match, you know that A) the document came from that person (because presumably they are the only ones with the private key and therefore the only ones capable of producing that exact ciphertext) and B) that the document was not altered, because if it had been altered there'd be a different hash value. Neat stuff.",

I don\u2019t know if you have kids, but as an example\u2014imagine your kids\u2019 school sent you an email to let you know that a stripper or exotic dancer would be visiting your child\u2019s classroom to read them a story. But oh, don\u2019t worry! Because the stripper will be fully dressed; just maybe with some colorful attire.\n\nHow would that make you feel? I know it\u2019s easy for us to just sub-consciously support anything for the sake of \u201cinclusivity\u201d, but truly put yourself in those shoes. Because in real life you\u2019d probably feel much different. That it\u2019s just wildly inappropriate at worst, and wholly unnecessary at best.\n\nWe barely teach kids ACTUAL important things like how to do spend money; how to maintain hygiene; how to watch out for bad friends; and countless other GENUINELY beneficial skills. So why propagandize children with such things instead of inviting someone like a doctor, a firefighter, a musician, or an actual professional performer like a ballerina dancer?\n\nThe fact that I\u2014yes, me (a man)\u2014can literally put on some lipstick and wear a wig, call myself a drag Queen, and then literally call up your kids\u2019 school to perform a show, or \u201cread them a book\u201d\u2014with or without the parent\u2019s knowledge\u2014is extremely disturbing to me.\n\nI don\u2019t expect us to agree with each other, but that\u2019s okay.

And it\u2019s not propaganda. Gay people and drag queens exist. Showing your children that there is more than one type of person in the world is beneficial to creating a person who isn\u2019t a close-minded bigot. A drag Queen reading a children\u2019s book is one way to do that. And to them, it\u2019s just a person who likes to wear dresses and makeup telling a story.",

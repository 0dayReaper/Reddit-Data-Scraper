My nephew saw him attacking her in an alley, she was my nephews childhood friend. So nephew grabs a branch because this dude is twice his size, and he manages to get the attacker off the woman. Dude turns around and tazes my nephew then stabs him over 30 times. He got 13 years in prison, he'll be out at the age of 32. Full life ahead of him to stab whoever he wants, my nephew died.",

When he thought the heat had died down a bit he and his wife tried to sneak back into Germany by bus. \n\nOn this bus journey he behaved so inappropriately towards a random female passenger (in the presence of his wife) that the bus driver paid him personal attention. The driver then recognised he was possibly the wanted man from the original attack and contacted the German police to meet the bus when it stopped.\n\nDude being a piece of shit to random women on such a consistent basis is ironically how he was caught",

Happened in 2017 in Berlin. \n\nIt's a bit complicated but afaik he had an IQ of 60 and a brain injury from a car accident that led to mood swings. He was drunk and high on hard drugs after a fight with his wife and family. Maybe she reminded him of his wife, but he claimed he couldn't remember that night so he never explained why he did it. \n\nThat's why they let him off rather easy and gave him only 3 years prison.",

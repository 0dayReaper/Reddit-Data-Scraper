They can spin to right themselves, lower their terminal velocity by spreading out and point their legs at maximum length for impact. A car would theoretically also be a slightly better landing pad due to the bend in the metal breaking their fall. It's not ideal, and the cat is probably injured, although likely not life threateningly, with only 37% of cats that fell from substantial heights needing emergency surgery.",

He was in and out of therapy /psychiatrist chairs throughout his childhood and teens usually for other reasons, anger issues bad performance in school etc.  In our teens I was genuinely scared of him.  Didn't stop until I ended up gaining 6 inches and about 50lbs on him, lol.\n\nIt just baffled me how two kids just 2 years apart in age can end up so different.  Took him 5 years to graduate highschool, hes 43 and works a menial job and lives in a trailer and has a superiority complex toward everybody the size of the grand canyon.  Always tries to act like he's the smartest guy in the room.  Gets so annoying at family gatherings where I want to just dress him down, but I'd be the bad guy then.",

Cluster B personality disorders are a combination of genes and environment, with environmental factors not to be underestimated. Most notorious killers and violent criminals had abusive and horribly dysfunctional childhoods lacking consistent love, support, or model behavior. It's a common sign of abuse when kids continue to wet the bed past an age in which that's normal, so I'd assume that's why it's a part of the McDonald triad.",

Cat would have to be extremely unlucky. Their terminal velocity is only about 60 mph, which isn't generally fatal. In fact, there are recorded instances of cats falling 20+ stories and landing and walking away uninjured. Plus the way their legs are constructed are very springy, so they absorb the shock of landing very well.  Mostly when the cats get hurt is when they fall from about 7 to 12 stories because they tense up as they reach terminal velocity, but after they hit it they tend to spread out and relax.",

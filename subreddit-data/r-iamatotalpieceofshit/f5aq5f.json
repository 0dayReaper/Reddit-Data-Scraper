I did my best to recover. 8 months later I wasnt myself anymore and my daughter butted heads with me (she was just over a year) and it gave me a concussion. my primary care physician said he was sure I only got a concussion because of my previous injury, so i went to my lawyer and tried to get workers comp to pay for my new visits. Well they told me to go to my neurologist, who promptly told me that because I was young and strong enough to work again that my recovery had gone far enough that she didnt think the two injuries were related. I have dissociative episodes, chronic behavioral health problems and constant neck and back pain, but because as soon as I could walk and talk again I went back to work so I could feed my kid i clearly cant have any lasting issues. \n\nDoctors suck, the system sucks. She overruled my doctor and every other doctor since then, and because of her judgement that the injuries werent related she made a precedent that all of my other issues arent related. I shouldn't be 26 and unable to feel my hands, I shouldn't be 26 and wake up with neck and back pain, I shouldnt be 26 and have to be accompanied by my wife everywhere I go because sometimes I forget where I am and get disoriented. All this because a doctor thought i was fishing for disability.\n\n\nSorry to rant, I just hate this system and I really hate fucking brain injuries.",

Her opinion was the medical knowledge backing up my case. During the course of treatment I was unable to pay my Bill's because I hadn't won my case yet, so I pushed to work as soon as i could but before i was fully recovered. She saw that as my injury not being that bad because i was able to work again pretty quickly. When i went back to her less than a year later with a concussion from a baby she thought I was trying to scam for disability. \n\n\nSince her opinion established my head injury as severe her she was the one my PCP told me to go to. Going to her and having her say the injury was unrelated gave the insurance company's claim that they shouldnt have to pay for treatment weight because they were only responsible for my original injury. It's not that there is one central database, it's that I wanted to go after the same company that already had my records and my doctor's input. In order for them to pay for the second injury she would need to say the I juries were related, and she wouldnt.",

Tons of circumstances can get in the way of a person being happy and cooperative (at the least) but ultimately the person has to choose to be so in the first place. And plenty of students do not choose to be.\n\nI've seen plenty of great parents at a total loss, which is okay: we are talking about an entirely different human being with a will of their own, so it figures that they may not listen and sometimes they may not listen at all. Gotta figure there is a reason for it but it isnt always on the parents. There are steps involved at that point, and I've seen some kids get it in the end. Sure they went to alternative school, may have dropped out, etc, but I've seen them come back after being in the real world a bit, looking for guidance. That's fine too, just not preferred. Mostly I just hope that kids not \"feeling it\" at least arent jackasses about it.\n\nEdit: made myself watch the video finally. Yeah, that would get the student arrested in my district. If that wasnt what followed, the teacher has some ground to go up against the school for not supporting a safe environment for him and his students.",

I agree with your sentiment but it is way more politically challenging. If too many kids are getting expelled/suspended or in too much trouble it looks bad on the teacher/VP/Principal. What happens working in a really rough area like where I do is that the bar for behavior that can actually get a kid kicked out/expelled starts getting higher and higher.\n\nI advocate for suspending/kicking out kids all the time especially the more physical/violent ones. Mostly the parents come in having a hissy fit about how its the teacher and the other student's fault and the VP/principal just kind of cave.\n\nIt seems terrible except for the fact that if a principal expels a certain amount of students they will start getting blow-back from above about how its their fault and they need to get things under control. This will trickle down to the principal whining at the VP's that we can't have so many suspensions/expulsions. Then the VP's will start getting upset at the teachers for sending student's down too often. Then the teachers are left in a position where they either deal with all the terrible behaviour, quit, or continue sending kids down (deservedly) but eventually get disciplined and potentially fired.\n\nAnyway that's a bit of an excessive rant but a lot of people on here don't seem to understand the overall like Career/political considerations going on with why students get away with so much in some places.",

Failing students instead would likely have the same effect. Punishment designed to humiliate them may cause them to retaliate even more severely. In the end it's lose-lose, and a stark reminder that social education starts at home. Let's all be better parents!",

It was such an easy class, she basically just asked us to come up with fun ideas to film and utilize some of the concepts she was teaching. It was honestly great just being able to work with friends and come up with stupid video ideas to film but 80% of the other students didn't do anything at all. Like, why take the friggin class if you have no interest in it, and even if you have no interest in it, she's asking for such a small amount of effort. It honestly saddened me to see how little people respected her class.",

But what happened was, he ended up getting gastric bypass surgery, and after he lost a significant amount of weight (over the summer), he started getting a lot of disingenuous female attention from students; like literally flirting with the man but clearly just pulling his leg. However some photos came out of him and a big group of girls on the cheerleading squad all drinking in their bikinis at his house and hanging out. I think they were using him for alcohol and a place to party. It made me think of him when I saw that movie Ma. I don\u2019t think he ever did anything inappropriate with anyone but I still always just felt so bad for him.",

This is an extreme example of teacher bullying and the shear violence like this isnt as common but emotional bullying is extremely common and what we deal with the most. I have been lucky enough to have strong patience and being able to see past these kids fake tough exterior cause at the center they are dumb 15-17 year olds who, even though we like to look at them as adults and should always know better, they dont fuckin always know better cause a lot of them come from terrible home life. I'm not saying any of this bullying is good but I have had many a day where I kept a kid after class and had a serious conversation with them about their behavior, I speak to them more like an adult and never condescending. Some times this works, some times I get told to fuck myself. However I always tell the kid the same thing while staring directly at them very serious \"I'm never going to embarrass you in front of your friends cause I know you like this tough persona you got going on and I wont take that from you, but I want you to know that you will never scare me. I am gonna push you to be the best person, student, human you can be but at the end of the day if you fail, its all on you.\"",

Also the person filming should not put themselves in any danger trying to help. That guy could have had a gun or chloroform or anything. Do not get into a stranger's car, ever. Saving a life feels amazing, yes. Killing the person out of negligence, when they could have been saved by a trained person, will be hard to live down. \n\nMANY people have drowned trying to save swimmers because they didn't have the training or gear. MANY people have gotten shot or stabbed to death trying to stop a mugging or robbery because they didn't have the training or gear.\n\nThe fact that he has control of a vehicle makes this a much more complicated scenario than just grabbing the girl out. You could hurt someone very badly by pulling them in the wrong way, especially if they are passed out.\n\nI wish helpful training could be free for any citizens who want to save lives. We should train and encourage people who want to commit acts of selflessness.",

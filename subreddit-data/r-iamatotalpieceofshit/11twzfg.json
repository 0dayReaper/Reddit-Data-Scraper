Our justice system fails to function effectively if people are tried in the media. This is a basic premise that any person of at least teenage years should understand. As far as this headline it\u2019s merely a restating of what the suspect told the police. Do not conflate journalistic integrity with being an apologist for ALLEGED criminal behavior. And it IS ALLEGED until there is a conviction, regardless of whether or not the suspect confessed to police. You are aware that cops often coerce confessions right? Good grief. I MUST be on a raft with the masses.",

However, I\u2019ve always thought that that\u2019s actually a good sign. Most of us can\u2019t understand it because we aren\u2019t crazy. It seems repulsive to us because we\u2019re not sick.

Everyone was sent home and there were emergency meetings the rest of the day with the appropriate staff. \n\nThe girl in question was never back in class. The professor later said that as soon as this particular girl said what she said, some previous odd and off colour statements suddenly clicked and he realised that both her kids were fathered by her brother. If this had been pretty much anyone else in the class, we would have probably stayed and worked through it as a therapist would have to IRL, but since kids were involved he had to take immediate action.",

The saddest part is that this story goes even deeper than is being told. Molestation and incest must be rampant in that family, not to mention the emotional and psychological abuse that must be going on. That poor girls life and the lives of any snd all of the other children involved is destroyed. The parents should be prosecuted to the fullest extent and the children given the help that they need. Before you read this and pass any judgement on me for saying any or all of that, know this, I have survived 13 years of emotional, psychical, mental, and sexual abuse at the hands of my father, and not just me, but my brothers and sisters as well. My father was an absolute monster in the worst possible way. So, I think I know a thing or two about this kind of thing. My father pretended to be a good man. Went to church every Sunday, helped out the neighbors and to the outside world was a good man. But to his family he was a violent, abusive, angry, monster that raped his children then would threaten to kill them and would often times beat them into such a way that we were absolutely terrified of him. Even my mother was beaten and abused by him. Pieces of garbage like them do not deserve to live. They do not deserve to draw breath. People like this are inhuman monsters. And should be treated as such. I have no doubt in my mind that this little girls father was no better than mine. And people like them deserve nothing less than the death penalty because that\u2019s exactly what they give their victims. They kill everything that they can be and leave a darkness of self doubt, insecurities and fear in their wake.",

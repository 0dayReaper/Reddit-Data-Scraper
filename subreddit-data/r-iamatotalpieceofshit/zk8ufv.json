And I think the original commenter\u2019s point is that considering protecting the belongings of Walmart or Doritos to be \u201cprotecting society\u201d is misguided. Those belongings are largely expendable. The effect of an isolated instance of theft is negligible. To a degree where it seems to matter very much to whom the stuff belongs. It just doesn\u2019t follow that if you, the standard civilian, doesn\u2019t stop this loon from stealing from Walmart, Target, Home Depot, etc that within your children\u2019s or grandchildren\u2019s lifetime anarchy is a plausible end. Theft is wrong; not disagreeing with that. But our individual moral obligation to take action seems specifically dependent on factors such as whether a corporation is the victim or not.",

Most of your second comment seems to be spent trying to convince me that theft is wrong regardless of the victim. A point I have conceded. The crux of disagreement is that you think a general shopper at a Walmart should take action against a thief, and I don\u2019t understand how that translates to the world being a better place. That\u2019s specifically dangerous. And from my perspective, the change imposed is no where near comparable to the risk incurred. Most find it important to have a balance of risk/reward (for lack of a better word). Risking bodily injury to save someone from bodily injury, for example. \n\nAlso, if you want to live in a world where theft from Walmart just doesn\u2019t happen at all, you probably want Walmart to fall. Moral \u201cevil\u201d (to use your terminology) is not always as simple as \u201cbad guys do bad things\u201d. \n\nThe reason for most of the comments saying that inaction is preferred is that the \u201csocietal bonds\u201d that you speak of are already deteriorated by the exact entity you are arguing to protect. Are saying that despite the \u201cevils\u201d that Walmart brings about the communities in which they flourish, they should still be protected from direct \u201cevils\u201d such as theft?",

Besides, with the prison system like it is, I'd rather not throw them in prison for stealing some food. You take problem with petty theft.

Gas at this time was the highest in the country at $1.80 (it hit 2.40 in the heat of things) a box of strawberries is 10 dollars and a bag of grapes can be 15 (I think due to the town being on Vancouver Island)\n\nThe town has a general disgust for the less fortunate and homeless population and they have absolutely no problem showing it. There was an incident where a homeless man was sleeping in his car and the RCMP harrased the crap out of him, sicked the dog on him, shot the man and accidentally the dog and the entire town expressed their condolences for the dog. The DAMN dog.\n\nApparently the man was tight on funds and was trying to feed his family. \n\nI am NOT defending theft in any capacity but this man is literally just trying to survive. You can tell in the video. He isn't willing to touch anyone, fight back, looks like he probably has only done this once or twice. \n\nAnd God damn it people, it is not your job to defend walmart, there is security, police, trained personnel for these scenarios. Walmart also factors the cost of theft all the time. \n\nAgain, Not defending theft. But mind your business. What if the guy has a knife?",

My wife and I couldn't be more excited about it. \n\nHow would it take somebody 5 freaking years to potty train their own kid?! And still rely on diapers?? Pretty soon, that kid's going to need depends (hopefully, his dad loses any custody so he can actually live long enough. )",

However, I have friends with kids who are older than mine (my kid is still a baby, couple of months away from being a toddler) and they were all off of diapers by three and a half to four and a half years old. Sure, you still get some accidents here or there, but they weren't wearing diapers anymore. Diapers get expensive, and most parents I know can't wait to get their kids out of them and into regular underwear.",

It doesnt take much strength to pull a trigger, and a virtually none if the gun is not loaded and the trigger has been depressed before, as the firing pin is no longer giving any resistance.  That is the much more likely case here as the child pulls it multiple times. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example a 1911 has a stock trigger pull weight of 4.5lbs but if the trigger has been dry fired and the slide not pulled back to cock it the trigger weight is around 3oz.  As I said with how often the kid is mashing the trigger and the ease with which he is doing it would point to it being the latter.",

They spend shitloads of time these days fetishing guns and gun culture as were it toys.   \n\n\nOne of the first thing you learn as a marksman is not to see guns as toys or tools, they are weapons. You don't point them at things (animals, humans, paper targets, etc) unless you intend to pull the trigger and deal with the consequences. IT IS NOT A TOY! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt also means storing your gun safely and if possible not at your home if you don't need to have it there.  If it has to be in your home, you'll have to make darn sure nobody can get to it unless of an age were they too can respect it for the weapon that it is (possible having followed classes at a club). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am talking about GUN CULTURE here, something that is a gripe of mine.  Something that the NRA ( a lobby group for gun manufacturers that want to sell more) has been advertising and broadcasting for ages now. As do other similar groups. They fetishize it, they act as if it is all fun and games and people like me are \"spoil sports\" for taking the toy away. It's insulting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI loved being a marksman and I loved shooting. But this gun culture has to stop.",

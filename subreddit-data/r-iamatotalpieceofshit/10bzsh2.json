I can only hope I do half as good a job as some of the CNAs I look up to and it can be incredibly rewarding to see my group happy and content despite their disease. \n\nBut I have felt real genuine anger when being scratched, bit, or slapped while trying to assist someone. It can be incredibly mentally draining when you try to help and are hurt by someone who doesn't understand what's going on. I've gotten frustrated at work but obviously never has the thought ever occured to me of bullying some one like this who needs help. This caregiver is an affront to everyone who works this job and is the reason so many families are scared to allow their family member in a card home. I have felt so much shame in those rare moments when I have had to excuse myself from the floor over my frustrations and here is this person shamelessly bullying a defenceless woman and the people watching and filming are equally as respinsible. I hope this woman got the care she needed eventually and I hope the shameful employees got prison time for this.",

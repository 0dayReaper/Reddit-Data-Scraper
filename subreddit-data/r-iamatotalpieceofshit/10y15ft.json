I used to work as a fireman, and there are many things that a fire truck on its way to a life endangering incident can do.  I was personally there and busted through a guys drivers and passengers windows, who was parked in a fire lane so that my hose could reach the building with people trapped in it.  Fair warning, if you don\u2019t get out of the way as expected (within reason obviously), a fire truck can push you out of the way. \n\nWhen lives are on the line, a fire truck can make sure they are able to get to a scene to help the people trapped.",

That's why you won't see firetrucks pushing cars out the way or breaking windows unless there is no choice whatsoever. If there is a way to bring a water supply via alternate route they must use it instead of damaging someones car... Just an example",

It was scary because there is only one way out from their home and a drive that should have taken them 10-20 minutes took them 3 hours, and they ran out of gas. I ended up getting gas, and taking old logging roads with my son giving me directions over the phone because my GPS couldn't figure things out, and making it to them so they could have enough gas to get to the nearest open station. A drive that should have taken me an hour and a half took about 6. This is why I now never let my car get below half full if I can possibly help it. So many people in my parents' area lost their homes, most of them lower income families.",

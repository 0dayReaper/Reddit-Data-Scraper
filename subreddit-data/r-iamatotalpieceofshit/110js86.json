Most of the nurses I've met are pretty awesome. This appears to be a SNIFF, these nurses sometimes have 12-40 pts depending. This nurse is in the wrong, but they are truly stretched thin at nursing homes. \n\nI watched a pt literally turn on her call light EVERY MINUTE claiming she had to use the bathroom. The cna taking care of her was almost in tears from frustration. They are forced to awnser the call light, even tho they know the pt had dementia and forgot they just went. You can explain to this pt until your blue in the face that they just went to the bathroom and they don't need to go, but once you leave that room their call light is on again.\n\nThe problem is the nursing homes more than anything. Stretching aids and nurses to insane pt ratios. These residents, nurses, aids, and workers all deserve better. Sadly this is what can happen, a burnt out frustrated nurse taking her anger out in a pt.",

It is an outpatient procedure, so they send you home the same day. I got home, and the damn incision bled all night. I called oncology the next morning, and they said to go to the ER, and the ER would contact the surgeon who implanted it. The nurse who was attending to me stood there poking my fresh and bleeding incision and kept pressing on the port itself, all while saying, \"Why are you even here?\" And \"Does this hurt?\". I was already traumatized from the port surgery (whole other story) and was terrified because it had been bleeding so much. And here she was adding to the chaos. So I told her to stop touching me, and if she did it again, there would be hell to pay. She stopped but continued to be snarky to me. \n\nI have kicked nurses off my service many times. I just outright refuse to be treated like this. I have zero patience for it and make it very clear that I have no issues reporting them to not just their employer but their registering body. \n\nKnow your rights, and don't be afraid to be \"a difficult\" patient. They are there to provide you with care, not abuse you.\n\nJust wanted to add that I know not everyone is ablento advocate for themseleves, this is why it is important to have someone with you who can.  Or to tell someone you trust if you are being abused by a care taker.\n\nAnd family and friends of those of us who are in vulnerable situations, please PLEASE believe your family or friend if they tell you they are in this kind of situation. Don't ignore the signs and do something about it! It literally can be the difference between your loved one living or dying.",

They transferred him to a room and the nurse had just gotten into a chair then he said he had to go to the bathroom and she yelled at him front of me because it took her so long to get him up and she didn\u2019t want to move him again. Unfortunately for her I worked with someone who was good friends with the head of nursing (I didn\u2019t know that at the time) but told the story at work. She called me to her office and asked what happened. The nurse ended up transferred to some place horrible. Apologies to me couldn\u2019t come fast enough.",

Even people in retail work are starting to snap more because of the low manning and constant demand of the job and I can only imagine how much more demanding it is to work with the elderly like this is. Most are losing their minds and have dementia and freak out. They are scared and confused so they act out or hostile and the care takers who already are over worked get the bet down over it. They should get a mandatory 2 or 3 month payed leave to not only entice more people to work on nursing fields but could help support mental health of our nurses. It wont be possible at first till their are enough nurses but it could be a good hook. Nurse need more leave.",

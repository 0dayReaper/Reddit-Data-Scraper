The international community (ie the UN, UNESCO, the Arab League, the EU, Russia, and the US)  has repeatedly reaffirmed the status quo agreement &amp; it was officially recognized in the 1994 peace treaty between Israel and Jordan, who maintains custodianship over the Islamic Waqf.\n\nIsraeli settlers have repeatedly made provocative moves, signaling a desire to upend the status quo agreement. So small actions like say, wanting to conduct a religious ritual, are seen within that context. In other words, those actions are seen as a slight against the sovereignty of Palestinians and an indication of yet one more piece of land/property/etc. the Israeli government will confiscate.",

Judaism believes God created the world standing from the rock. However, more importantly, the mosque is built on the foundation of what used to be a massive Jewish temple. However, the temple was destroyed by the Romans in 70CE. The wall that was closest to the holy of holies or Western Wall is still standing and is where Jews will leave prayers to this day. Islam believes that the prophet Muhammed ascended to heaven from the rock, which is where the mosque is built on top of. While there have been agreements, the site has always been a point of tension between the two religions. This most recent attack from the Israeli army is hardly the first, even in recent history. Sometime a few years ago, the Israeli army pulled the same shit and killed several people. So, unfortunately, this latest attack comes as no surprise, and there will likely be more violence to come. At the end of the day, they're just killing each other over a fricking rock.",

Apartheid South Africa did the same, they put the people in their own \"country\" and so couldn't vote. Israel doesn't want 2 states as that would mean millions more voting. \n\n* Israel has ethnically cleansed and fragmented areas into isolated cantons divided by Israeli settlements called Palestinian enclaves, and implemented lebensraum tactics. This was called Bantustans in South Africa.\n\n* It denies Palestinian fishing past 3 nautical miles in some areas, and not past 15 nautical miles\n\n* The Apartheid Separation wall\n\n* The settlers killing, and burning homes to get rid of people, stealing homes and destroying olive tree groves.\n\n* They control the water completely. See: Water supply and sanitation in the State of Palestine.\n\n* They get 12 hours of electricity a day\n\n* Palestinians didn't have 3G until 2018, their access is also restricted.\n\n* They blockade See: Blockade of the Gaza Strip; making it a prison.\n\n* Not All Israeli Citizens Are Equal\n\n* There were `5,248,185` Palestinian refugees in 2020; that's equal to half the population of Israel. \n\n* Israel dictates who you can marry\n\n* Segregated road system\n\n* Israel Forcibly Injected African Immigrants with Birth Control\n\n* 50% of Palestinians are children.\n\nAs someone from South Africa, I've seen ethnic cleansing and Israel is doing worse. Israel is absolutely an Apartheid state. Various human rights organisations have already stated this. See my profile for actual links to this.",

Were the Irish to abandon their heritage it is likely they could be somewhat second class citizens within Britain but things are getting better there.  I get the sense things are getting better in Israel but it is hard to say.  America does influence Israel to go very far right and we are steadily fed a diet of media that promotes it as Islamic radicals fighting peaceful Israelis for no reason other than racism.  What they don't say is this happens to Christians as well.  1/5 of Palestinians are Christians.

Throughout history, 100% of *fighting* military were male. Most were adults. Right now in the US, 93.5% of marines are still male. Usually, statistical arguments make no sense (judging an individual based on an arbitrary group), but they do make sense when the percent is 100 (which it was in America just decades ago and still almost is). Language takes a while to change, and it will certainly change pretty slowly with only 6.5% of marines being women. I'm not assuming everyone in American - just using it as an example. It's largely the same case for militaries everywhere through all of history.\n\nEdit: I didn't complete the thought. This all means that killing women &amp; children is akin to killing civilians if you assume the fighting force is 100% men. With women getting into the military, I'm sure the common phrase will die out over decades or centuries.",

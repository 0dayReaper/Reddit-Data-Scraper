He is now facing charges of first-degree felony. No more info is known as of now.",

Maybe if the entire system changed to actually rehabilitate people, crime would go way down.

There was a guy in for murder and the prison changed his life for the better. He became a certified chef in prison, using sharp knives and used the time in there to actually be better.. it works. America only cares about money. And so many lives in the system ruined because the money isn't used in the right ways.",

Don't do aggressive gestures. I don't even understand how it got this far.\n\n4- Don't push people. Step away from them, otherwise you are starting a fight. Talk like a human being. Let him take the fucking phone. It is not worth it. Nobody condones his behavior either.\n\n5- And don't get yourselves involved, unless you know what you're doing.\n\nThe teacher wouldn't be in the hospital, and this kid wouldn't be joining criminality statistics moving forward.",

I read somewhere that in the United States police officers fatally wound about 3 suspects per day, that is a lot more than the ones sensationalized by popular news outlets, compared to how many shootings occur the reported ones are probably less frequent because not all of them will create the same amount of buzz as the very controversial ones.",

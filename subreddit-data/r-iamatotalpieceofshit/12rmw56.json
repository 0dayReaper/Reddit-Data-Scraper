Most people seeing this won't find it funny and will leave with the impression that he's garbage, not the person he is treating like garbage. \n\nHis desire is to feel big and superior and funny, but none of us (or most of us) see him that way, so it's not really feeding into his desire \n\nBut yes I do hate to see something like this at all knowing this boy was made to feel this way. On the one hand, you think a POS like this would probably engage in this behavior even without a camera? If it were me in the position of this boy, I'd rather he share his scummy face with the world vs no one ever knowing, and I'd want people to know that plenty of Russians find this behavior acceptable",

Seeing videos like this could have a very real effect on someone\u2019s level of empathy and influence thoughts on real important policy like immigration and could have a capacity to do good. It was grim for me to see the images of firefighters using a firehose to wash blood off of the sidewalk after a recent mass killing in Alabama near my farm. One could say it might make a deviant take notes, but the power of an image can have more of an impact than just a negative one.",

In a lot of them, when you are driving from the city to the sea/lake/ any other beach in general, you can very often seen just cars or even mini trucks on the side of the road filled with watermelons and melons being sold, because its almost a tradition atp watermelons on a beach go hand in hand together. And people selling them most of the time are from the surrounding small villages around the city and in russia most of the time its immigrants legal or illegal selling them, from Tajikistan or any other country like that, and Russians always view them as illegal immigrants who are worthless taking all the manual labour jobs and refer to them as \u201cChurka/Chushka\u201d especially because most of the time they cant speak russian. So I think this is where the stereotype is coming from for most post soviet countries not only russia, that people who dont look russian have darker skin and dont speak russian they would refer to them as churka and the watermelon stereotype also applies, basically humiliating the person showing they are dumb and worthless as they cant have a \u201cproper\u201d job and are illegal immigrants who dont have a choice.",

But as the video goes on you hear more of his Russian and he seems pretty fluent.\n\nI think he said it that way \"molodets\" with a deliberate accent, the way a foreigner would say it. Kind of as a taunt or a joke. Especially because _\u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0446\u044c_ is a word that's used a lot by people who speak broken Russian from neighbouring countries (especially Uzbeks, Tajiks, etc.).\n\nThe people in the background are also definitely very fluent in Russian, you can really hear it when he drops the watermelon and they get upset and say: _Make him eat it! Eat it, bitch_",

Even the indigenous people (Tatar) experience rampant racist hate and have basically been forced into becoming homeless gypsies.\n\nOn one trip there was one black guy with us, and he was treated basically like a dangerous space alien. I was so embarrassed by how he was treated. By the end of it, everyone else (all the other white people on the trip and myself) were basically a permanent shield for him from any locals. No joke, but probably close to HALF of the people there gave dirty looks, or said something negative, or acted like they wanted to cause a problem, or injury him or all of us. Some of them straight up thought that he wasn\u2019t even allowed to be there.\n\nIf a black kid had to grow up over there, I could easily believe that he would be killed. Especially in more rural areas, there is a violent HATRED towards black people. Of course, I\u2019m sure not *everyone* is racist over there, but it\u2019s worse than I could have ever imagined.\n\nIf you\u2019re black, I don\u2019t recommend going to Eastern Europe.",

It's mostly white but ppl here have very little racism in them, there are some like everywhere of course. There are ppl of color here, it's a university town where international students get cheaper tuition so there's lots of ppl 30 or less here of color going to school there are some older ppl that have settled here aswell. My point being that growing up when there were even less ppl of color I almost never heard any racism, and what little I did here was super mild like a joke at the expense of someone. \nI just don't understand and can't comprehend how ppl have that in them. I had a job going door to door selling things at 1 point and the guy training me was an Hindi man named Atul. He was cool and super nice but 1 or maybe twice a day you could just see it in ppl face when the opened there door and it wasn't a white knocking that they didn't like that, it really offended me. Another guy I worked at a grocery store with was Persian and we had covid masks on. A lady, who was old, couldn't hear him cuz of his mask not because of his English and asked his if there was someone who spoke English she could talk to, it really bothered me. These are, I guess, the mild forms of racism I can only imagine what some ppl have to go through and how jaded that must make them.",

[I'm not going to add specific names because I'd rather not give them popularity]. This is a clip of them kidnapping a 20 year old man who they had caught speaking to their 15 year old decoy for sex. They also put green colouring on his head, made him repeat racist remarks and had him perform oral on a beer bottle. The 20 year old reported this to the university and the group claims he was expelled.\n\nIn my opinion, it's definitely disgusting that the young man made that choice, however it's incredibly clear by  how this group went about \"exposing\" him that they use the anti-pedophile title as a guise. It also doesn't help that russian law enforcement basically encourages this treatment.",

Oh wait you just did and the reason why is to find better ways in manipulating people to purchase micro transactions. So next time you think about spending $1 because it will make your gameplay better, just think that was designed by a phycologist to make you spend that money.\n\nThis worlds fucked mate, can't even enjoy a video game without being forced to buy something just to have a better experience. Ads are thrown down our throats no matter what we do or buy. Even our clothes and cars have branding for advertisement and most see it as a status symbol instead of advertising. Fucked I tell ya, fucked",

Absolute greed at its finest. Remember when it was on disk and they\u2019d be fucked if it went wrong. Well now they don\u2019t even test the games or updates they just release them. Example would be toddlers getting messages from adults saying they look hot, parents falling in love romantically with their kids, or every character in your game being horrible to each other and every relationship in the game breaks down. Sims getting fears that make them run around like lunatics that won\u2019t go away so you can\u2019t play.",

It used to be the product was the game, but now they make services. You used to be a player and now you are a user. Usually the highest paid people on a game dev team are psychologists and marketers. The people with the money and make most of the decisions are business people, who are far too busy to play games, and certainly look down on the users as easily manipulated, addicted, sacks of pennies. No one from the outside is coming for gamers. They came for you from within. Sure you get the noisy minority, with the same old world view that has gone on forever, they even whined about books being a scourge on the youth when the printing press took off, they said they same of movies and television.  That never stopped any form of creative entertainment from propagating. What happened to all these forms of media is they become a product under capitalism, and in the age of information we've learned to squeeze every cent out them. To the point now where they've taken the happiness you gain from a game and exploited it. They push the right buttons in your neurochemistry, they hook you under the guise of creativity, a harmless hobby. They demand your attention, every possible moment they can have, for every second of your life is the potential for a dollar taken. Yet your life is limited, there is only so many moments to have, so much attention to give. There are those around you who would gain something other than money from your time. You yourself could gain something other than temporary dopamine hits with your time.",

Should we now be concerned of the influence there?\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong I get the argument but in corporate world money talks. For Epic to have gone far they needed a company with the resources required. And as a by product of that yes directors are nominated. \n\nWhen any company buys a stake they are allowed to nominate directors or representatives of the investments companies interest. \n\nFrom an influence perspective from the foreign government yes it is a concern but if there was a problem the government would not have let the sale go through. If there\u2019s still a problem Sweeney being the majority stakeholder can ask for others to buy into the company.",

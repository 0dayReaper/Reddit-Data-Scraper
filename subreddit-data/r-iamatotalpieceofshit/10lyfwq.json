At the end of the day they usually throw away a lot of food because it's perishable and they have no one to give it to.  The reason is a lot of them decline the food.  They also have food kitchens where they can go to eat a warm meal.\n\nBillion with a B. You can be sure that there's plenty of corruption there.  There's lots of people getting rich off the homeless.  Housing the homeless, feeding the homeless are all very profitable for some since the states give them so much money to deal with those issues.",

It sucks that there were so many of these jackasses playing the \u201cwell the homeless are the issue\u201d card over trying to understand the nuance of what it takes to get by when you have nothing.

People in general don't care about that rule the world at least in the us has become a giant high-school where most people didn't reach maturity. \n\nThat said, a person is a much better person than me if they give to the homeless. Drug needles everywhere, they constantly ask you for money, some make up sympathy stories just to try to get you to give them anything. I remember a while back in my town there was a homeless guy that kept constantly asking me for money and his story was that he just wanted money for a hotel room until him and his daughter could get out of town. I'd seen the guy for months and I'd heard his story recited to me over and over again, I never gave him money last time I saw him he started getting really desperate because he started asking people right next to a entrance of a bar next to the town mall. \n\nPoint is you shouldn't trust homeless people, but you also shouldn't make fun of them and destroy their lives, you never know what they are going through, they already tend not to trust themselves.",

We make sure to have a nice, home cooked meal for them and we sit around our large dining table and have church. Last time we had 19 people. More homeless than not homeless. Some of the comments they\u2019ve said to me breaks my heart. Here are just a few:\n\n\u201cI like it here because I feel safe.\u201d\n\u201cYou see us.\u201d\n\u201cWe feel like we\u2019re invisible.\u201d\n\u201cWe feel like people hate us.\u201d\n\u201cThose of us who are trying to change are being lumped in with the ones who are drug addicts or alcoholics.\u201d\n\nWe have a nice home, which we bought with the church in mind and we even had just chairs in the living room for a little over a year so we could make sure we\u2019d get the best type and quality of furniture for the people coming and the longest dining table we could find. We never expected to minister to the homeless. It wasn\u2019t even on our radar. It\u2019s just kind of evolved into that. However, it definitely makes you look at life differently. I was born poor and didn\u2019t have much, but was never homeless so it\u2019s been eye opening. \n\nIt breaks my heart when they first come because they\u2019re surprised that we\u2019re welcoming them into our home. They\u2019ve been looked down on, been beaten down, broken down so much that it\u2019s hard for them to see anything good. There will always be \u201clifers.\u201d My dad used to run a liquor store in a major city and he made a deal with the panhandlers that as long as they stayed off of his block, they were allowed to buy from his store, if not, he wouldn\u2019t sell to them. There was one guy who was a \u201clifer.\u201d He said it was better than a 9-5. He makes over $50,000 a year and takes a 2 week long vacation toLas Vegas e every year. If he wants to he stays home. If it\u2019s raining, home. He\u2019s tired? He ends the day early. Sad. \n\nYou learn to know who really needs the help. If they\u2019re embarrassed to ask, that\u2019s how you know they\u2019re different. There\u2019s one guy in our town that stands outside Walmart and asks for money. He and his dog beg and then when he\u2019s done he walks over to his truck that he\u2019s parked across the street, hops in and drives home to his apartment. That\u2019s someone you learn not to give to.",

In those shelters they usually don\u2019t allow much personal items beyond what you can carry. Then there is government housing which in most cities in the US there is a long waiting list. This is typically what people refer to as \u201cproject housing\u201d. Next is subsidized private housing like housing vouchers that pay a portion of your rent in homes a person usually wouldn\u2019t be able to afford.

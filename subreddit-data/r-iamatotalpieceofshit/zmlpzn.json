True, AIDS was being reported as a growing problem in late 81-82, but for the most part the media and public didn't take AIDS any more seriously than the government. I was 10 in 81 and remember all of the stupid fear mongering about how you could contract the disease.  I'm not sure what more he could have done, beyond putting money into research and relaxing FDA approvals so that AZT could get approved early.\n\nAs for the crack epidemic and war on drugs, that clearly had terrible consequences and I would like to see the 13th Amendment further amended to strike the part that allows for prison labor.  I would also like to see us getting out of the nation building business and focusing on fixing our own problems.",

When my mom died, and I came in to chat and the streamer said \"how's things\" I said \"mom passed this morning\" and you know what happened?  He stopped what he was doing, took a moment to offer condolences, and so did the 100-or-so people in chat.  Granted, he and most of the chat knew the day was coming as I had previously spoken about her cancer, but coming to chat and talking to everyone actually helped me - it's really crazy just how much some random stranger on the internet offering up their thoughts for you actually helps!  I couldn't imagine what the feelings would be if this was the guy instead!  What a dark hole to dig for someone  \n\n\nBest we (the general public) can do is steer clear of people like this, and stick to streams where communities are built and grow because everyone is awesome",

He finally logged back on and joined a Twitch stream I was hosting. I was excited to see him and just casually asked him how he was doing. He said that he nearly took his life and was in a hospital recovering and also getting a lot of psychiatric help. This guy has been my online friend for a while so I paused the stream to just ask him if he needed to talk. he didn\u2019t want to interrupt the stream, but he did miss talking to me, so I just drew while sending him messages to him on discord so they were just between me and him. I almost had to stop the stream because I was getting emotional, but i continued for him because he wanted to watch me draw and didn\u2019t want to interrupt.\n\nThat was a good couple years ago now, he\u2019s doing so much better and we met in person last summer. Just a really good dude and the world and my life are better with him in it. He\u2019s my best friend and we talk daily to make sure we are both doing ok as we both have depression and still have our rough days. We get though them together.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take much to show someone a little compassion and understanding. Videos like this make me so sad and angry because this is not what we need more of in the world. There\u2019s a lot of toxic streamers and influencers out there, do your best to be better than them because it\u2019s easier and more rewarding to be a better person.",

I'm glad streamers like this get a little dose of reality every once in a while and are dragged through the mud for their shitty behaviour - I don't want to take away anyone's livelihood, but being a streamer and having that job is a privilege, not a right. Fail to treat your viewers like human beings and you're eventually going find this out the hard way when those numbers drop and you're back out into the job market, wondering wtf happened.",

    "postText": "Seven bodies, including two that investigators believe belong to two missing teenage girls, were found Monday afternoon at an Oklahoma residence of a man who authorities were seeking in the teens' disappearance, officials said. The bodies were found at a property in Henryetta, a city about 90 miles from Oklahoma City, authorities said. Earlier Monday, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol issued\u00a0an endangered/missing advisory\u00a0for the two girls, a 14-year old and 16-year old, as well as a 39 year old registered sex offender who had missed his court date for solicitation of a minor.",

I checked the registry when my daughter was little, and I couldn\u2019t believe how many of them lived near me. I lived in a pretty nice suburb in Broken arrow, which is a small town subset of Tulsa. They\u2019re everywhere. And these are the registered ones! Years after that, my daughter\u2019s friend\u2019s dad went to jail for trying to have sex with a fourteen year old. He lived around the corner. Then, our other neighbor, who was one of those helpful old men who tell you what kind of fertilizer to use on your lawn and how to fix your engine, well he went to jail for having sex with another fourteen year old friend of my daughter\u2019s! AND, if those weren\u2019t bad enough, one of the volunteer dads at her school went to prison for kidnapping a five year old out of her bedroom, raping her, and leaving her naked on the side of the road. So, yeah, they\u2019re everywhere. I was pretty vigilant luckily enough.",

I'm sorry but if you're a single mother (or father) with children, you need to thoroughly vet each guy/gal you date and assume he's a pedophile and wants to molest your kids. It's a sad reality of dating as a single parent of minors, but sticking your head in the sand only gets you and your kids hurt. Just like this family and countless families throughout the US. This happens daily.",

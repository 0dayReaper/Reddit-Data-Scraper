After taking apart a valve of a critical system to replace the seat and struggling to take the old one out, we learned that supply department ordered the valve seat for a valve that had been retired for decades. So, being up for a couple days at this point, we had to refirb the valve to bring the critical system back up. That stupid seat is literally worthless to anyone else but it holds memories for me.",

Doesn't justify the act just saying that some petty crooks can be crafty. I remember seeing a guy get arrested for stealing the loose change and bills out of a truck in broad daylight (the owner left the windows down and the keys in). When the cop asked why the guy didn't take the truck or the tools he said \"I'm okay going to jail but there's no way I want to go to prison.\".",

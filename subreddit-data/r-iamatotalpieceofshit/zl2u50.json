She blew off the court hearings I was awarded treble damages so now it\u2019s closer to 10k. Years and years of hearings to get a payment plan in place where she\u2019d pay 150/mo to pay it down. Funny part, $150/mo does basically nothing for me, I look at it as gas money, but jfc this girl has every excuse in the book why she can\u2019t make these payments.",

It trains police officers to be aggressive bullies and assume everyone is going to try and kill them. Yes, other countries do a better job, but we all know that the \"more training\" these two got is just going to reenforce this style of dangerous, aggressive, disrespectful policing.",

The two things I remember the most clearly were their mental gymnastics on why it is okay to shoot somebody in the back that is running away from you. Even if they haven't committed a violent crime, apparently you wouldn't know that they aren't jumping into that person's backyard to go and murder an entire sleeping family. So it's okay to shoot them because you're protecting that family.\n\nThe other one was worse because they used a real life example. They were discussing a car chase that ended in a shootout. The car had a passenger, that as far as the police knew was not involved at all. But pursuing officers still surrounded the car and then proceeded to shoot into the windshield indiscriminately. They killed the passenger, a woman, and during the lecture they paused for a minute, made kind of a smirk, and said \"...but it's okay - she was just a hooker, so it's not like shooting a real person.\". Laughter ensues from about 3/5 of the class.  So about 18 people laughed.  18 people who were very close to being police in our city, and many probably are still employed in the area.",

I agree there should be restitution, it should be enormous, enough to make the police force decide they don\u2019t want to pay that out ever again. Enough that they start taking their training and education programmes seriously. \n\nI think they should be sacked and this video should be used for training all new recruits as a perfect example of how not to treat the public they are employed to protect. \n\nThe sooner American Police services create a national programme that is college/university based to create a national minimum (high level) standard, the better. Uniforms are for uniformicity and shared mental models, it shouldn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re dealing with officer A or officer Z, their approach should be the same high standard.",

These prosperity hucksters are the lowest of the low. And this guy in particular is a special brand of evil.\n\nBut, the vast majority of pastors I know just love Jesus and love people. They live modest lifestyles and have devoted their lives to serving others. Even if you disagree with them spiritually, they operate community food pantries, homeless outreach, addiction recovery, veterans services, special needs kids ministries, mentoring to at-risk youth, marriage and relationship counseling, financial coaching and assistance, just to name a few.\n\nAnd, they all universally loathe false teachers like Copeland--which the Bible explicitly warns about.",

The pastor there was a great guy, it was a small church and we SAW what the donations and tithes went to. Things like you said, foodbanks, helping people with disconnect notices pay their bills, buying new shoes and clothes for nursing home residents, they also had a huge townwide event at a park at the end of summer where they donated school supplies to families. The pastor worked for a landscaping company for income and his wife was a teacher at the middle school. Those are the kind of churches and pastors the world needs more of.",

E.g. 1100001 representing \"a\" in ASCII or unicode. \n\nIf you want to represent things like a, \u00e0, \u00e1, \u00e2, \u00e3, \u00e4, e, \u00e8, \u00e9, \u00ea, \u00eb, i, \u00ed, \u00ec, \u00ef, etc, how do you do that? \n\nDo you give each its own unique series of 1s and 0s?  That quickly becomes unwieldy.\n\nInstead, we have one sequence of 1s and 0s that represents the a in a, \u00e0, \u00e1, \u00e2, \u00e3, etc. - 1100001.  And then, after that,  there's a second sequence you put after it to tell the computer to put an umlaut, grave, tilde, etc over the a.\n\nZalgo text abuses that.   It says, \"print an a, but put a tilde, umlaut, uptack, ogonek, perispomeni, pashta, and zakef katan on it\".  It tends to look best when you grab really obscure combining characters instead of just a bunch of tildes and umlauts.  For example,  the pashta looks like  \u0599 and is put on Hebrew copies of the Torah to mark the traditional melody to chant it to.",

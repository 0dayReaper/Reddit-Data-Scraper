I get the rationale for having a low max sentence for true accidents, even reckless ones and deaths. But I don\u2019t see why this isn\u2019t simply murder? If they had shot guns at people instead but laughed about it the whole time and claimed to have been simply not thinking about the fact that their actions are likely to kill someone, can they treat that as an accident/prank too? Where does the line get drawn that what they did isn\u2019t intentional homicide? I mean I guess they took a plea but still, calling it a prank instead of an attack is simply odd.",

Some how he managed to switch seats and got on the passenger seat. The victims car started to catch fire and eventually burned with the victim inside. Hopefully she died on impact. Rescue got there too late but managed to save my friend before his car burn down. It was a close call. Anyways, given the injuries the firefighters claimed it was unlikely he was driving and some else was driving and ran off. He doesn't remember anything only going to a bar. In secret he told me it was him. I didn't know to believe him given the report, but I have witnessed his history drunk driving and told him that he'll one day kill someone and or himself. \nIt went to trial and he was guilty of Vehicular manslaughter. Got 4 years. It's been almost 3 years.  Anyways all I think is about the victims family and think , if that were my sister, I couldn't possibly be at peace with 4 years. He is my friend and all but the victims family don't deserve that. Sorry bud",

The fact they went to McDonald\u2019s afterwards, even knowing they\u2019d caused a serious injury. \n\nI saw a thing a few years ago and it was kids who had thrown a frozen Turkey from an overpass and they caused a woman serious injuries (she needed multiple surgeries, her face was permanently disfigured). Those kids were distraught at what they had done. They genuinely didn\u2019t seem to realise how serious the consequences could be, and once they did realise, they were so remorseful and sorry. The victim ended up asking for a shorter sentence for them, because she felt that they were just teens and they had no idea that they could cause such damage. Those kids turned their lives around. These little turds have basically learned they can do what they want and get away with it. Anybody killed or injured in the process is just collateral damage for the prank. It\u2019s disgusting. I hope they get hit by a guilt that eats away at their souls, the arrogant, remorseless, selfish little turds.",

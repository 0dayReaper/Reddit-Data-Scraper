Also, no updates on this case after it was covered in the news last year. \n\nSome of the cops involved felt it was excessive force and one, the cop with the baton's supervisor, felt it was unnecessary to give chase over a minor traffic violation.",

The damage to the public's opinion of Law Enforcement has already been done and the damage is *irredeemable* at this point. When an officer takes up their badge they are making an oath to the countries *people* not the country, that they will be a public servant and lay down there life in the line of duty if that is necessary. Causing the entire country to not trust the only thing keeping us in check is a crime worthy of death.",

I agree about the ones that know or see something illegal happening and don't report it or try to cover it up are just as bad as the ones committing the act.

Found out it was inbred and mentally challenged so it ended up on a farm away from people and animals to live out it's days in seclusion because it has become so vicious, rather then putting it down as those were the only options",

Most dogs will give quick snapping bites and let go as they're not actually interested in killing.\n\nPitbulls are also incredibly resilient to pain while in attack mode.  There's a video out there of a Pitbull attacking another dog while being beaten over the head with a 2x4 and it literally didn't let go until it had it's spine broken.",

He's mellowed out since turning 12 but in his hayday, I had to pull him off our chocolate lab on several occasions.. Hitting him only enraged him. He never lost the look of \"kill\". The only thing that ever worked, and this only worked with OUR dog because he is OUR dog, but I would have to put him in a headlock until he began to lose consciousness and only then would he snap out of it. Also, ripping his back legs from under him would get him to let go some of the times.. \n\nI wouldn't go bear wrestling some random dog, tho. Our boy is incredible with humans but awful with dogs so I knew he wouldn't attack me if I inserted myself. I wouldn't be so confident with somebody else's dog.",

That's a Pit Bull Terrier. The rest are other bully breeds and mixes raised by terrible owners and can be inbred with bad traits. Or other factors. \n\nA lady down the street from me was killed by her 'pit bull' last year. She was holding her grandbaby and fell while trying to sit because the chair was broken. She tried to catch the baby awkwardly which startled them and they started crying. The dog attacked the lady biting her neck and she eventually died from the wound. It was assumed that the dog thought the lady was hurting the baby. It still got put down.",

When at 7 months old it\u2019s not even done growing yet/ you don\u2019t know the temperament of the dog well enough to decide if you can breed it. \n\nSecond photo I don\u2019t understand. That person is so fucking dumb that they can\u2019t count correctly?  If I understand they plan on breeding that thing at least 40 times? They supposedly already have 33 people lined up to breed with him? And that after the first 10 breedings the price will go up? If you already accepted a stud deposit you can\u2019t bring the price up??  And then the poster mentions parts about deformations of other dogs, that people get for trying to produce these over muscles tiny bullies?",

It\u2019s far far too young in general but male dogs can be fertile as young as 6 months.\n\nIn dog breeding when it\u2019s successful, the penis swells and the pair \u201clock\u201d which is how you know it\u2019s successful. I\u2019m assuming that those are the lock ins he\u2019s mentioning. \n\n\nSo either he has taken a mature dog and mated it 33 times, or he\u2019s lying about it. And if he\u2019s not, none of those locks surely suoood have been recent enough to even know if he\u2019s fertile yet. But that\u2019s why he\u2019s going on about being a good breeder. It\u2019s potentially a scam too for this reason.  \n\n\nTo clarify I think this is abhorrent. \n\nI think you can breed a dog responsibly, but this is basically an inverse puppy mill money farm. It\u2019s like those guys who want to get as many women pregnant as possible for the satisfaction but do none of the work, except he\u2019s wanting paid through the nose for it.",

I decided to buy another pit off this loser who was backyard breeding in our little corner of the hood. This tiny dog started biting from moment we brought him in the house and never stopped biting. I was getting concerned because the father was huge.  A friend came over that lived in the area and saw the pup and asked \"did you get this dog from the guy whos breedin a brother and sister?\" The guy had all the remaining puppies running around his backyard so i lowered my puppy back over the fence and qalked away.",

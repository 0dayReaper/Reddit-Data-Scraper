Thank God it was the ground floor. \n\nFound a few dead people, tossed out more drunks than I ever thought possible, and cleaned every type of fluid of every conceivable surface. \n\nPeople treat things rough when the item doesn't belong to them. So I've seen everything broken in the weirdest ways. Including a wall destroyed by an Ford ranger tailgate. Left the tailgate sticking out of the wall. \n\nHad a church pay for two months for a homeless family. After 18 days the oldest woman asked me how much longer the water would be off in the building. Well, the water was not off and had not been off for months. They couldn't figure out how to pull out on the shower handle, and assumed the water was off (even though the toilet worked!?!) \nOf the 4 adults and one elementary aged kid, none of them had showered in 18 days. All they did the entire time was lay in bed all day everyday. \nThey were disgusting and none of them were handicapped, at least physically.",

On my sheet said these ppl were checked out but of course you still have to know so knocked a few times then I opened it up walked in on two men in bed yikes. I apologized a bunch and walked out a few minutes later these men I kid you not fully dressed in golf gear but like the super tacky kind swung the door open and TOOK off running down the hallway and out the door. So I was like alright then go into their room and good God....Blood everywhere like EVERYWHERE on the pillows, walls, toilet, the CEILING! There was even a trail of blood leading to the air conditioner the part that's outside the window....besides the blood all over there was liquor, weed and coke. So yeah guess they had a bloody good time in golf gear.",

Thing is they were on the top floor, so water was dripping down through other floors, coming out of light fixtures. The players were so drunk/hungover that house keeping had to just work around them while they were laying in bed.",

It's a really big mess by a kid.\n\nSo the story goes that this kid was with his mom on a trip. Mom and kid were sound asleep when the kid woke up and had to go to the bathroom. IMMEDIATELY! So he bolts to the bathroom and, unfortunately, doesn't make it in time (#2). So, like a good kid, he tries to clean it up all by himself. Trailing his mess all through the kitchen(to find the cleaning stuff), through the living room(to open the balcony door to air out the place), and AAAALLLLLL OVER the bathroom.\n\nMom wakes up to the kid crying over the realization that he is just making the mess worse.\n\nI didn't have to do the cleaning part, but we helped the mom get her stuff moved over to another room so the better cleaning team could get in before the mess set into the carpets. \n\nI. Saw. All. Of. It.\n\nI SMELLED all of it. \n\nIt was horror.",

Once we even dragged a huge rock into the middle of the stream and used a camp stove to make lunch in the middle of the river. It was an added challenge to be sure but it was funny!\n\nSorry, I kinda lost the thread in a big way there. Just meant to demonstrate that water works faster than just ice lol.",

            "comment": "This happened in Vietnam in December 2020. Dude had previous charge for aggravated assaults. He faced 2 years and 3 months for the incident in the video. The girl was 15 at the time, he cause many bruises and injury to her head, leading to multiple stitches and a break from school. And interview of the guy's mother said he has a 4 year old child who his mother (The child's grandmother) takes care of. He rarely visit them and was living with his girlfriend/wife (the woman on the back) at the time. \n\nPretty irresponsible human being, well deserved. Unfortunately this kind of this is not rare in rural areas of Vietnam.",

            "comment": "I *think* (not that it makes it ok at all) the reason no one is doing anything, or is slow to, is that they are believing or listening to whatever this dick is shouting.\n\nHe\u2019s likely blaming the teenager for the accident. None of the people present *saw* the accident happen. The only ones are someone in a white motorcycle who narrowly avoids the crash, who leaves the scene early on, and third vehicle involved, which seems to be a woman who is quite injured as she remains on the ground. \n\nThey are likely slow to react and assuming, due to a degree of ageism, that the teenager did cause the accident, and a certain degree of anger is justified.\n\nNot that that makes any of it ok, even if they *had* caused the accident (which they didn\u2019t). \n\nAnd once people are slow to react due to inertia from that original assumption, it becomes harder to suddenly change and get involved to stop it.\n\nThis is the only theory I can think of for why on Earth everyone is just standing there. Is one also not an officer of some kind? They have shoulder marks/rank slides?",

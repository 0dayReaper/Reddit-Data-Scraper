China has no laws against animal abuse so they keep doing it. Luckily china hates him and are against the abuse and the recent cat death and torture parties has been shut down. It is absolutely sick that people like that exist in this world",

So when I was doing a bid a few years ago in Maplehurst (near  Toronto, ON) and there was this gang banging, very annoying white boy with tats all over his face (those were my first impressions and boy was I wrong). He was very talkative and we were both on the same work shift so got to know each other a bit. I thought it was odd when on 3 occasions guards came up to see how he was doing and give em a new jumper and some other stuff. I asked em about it and he said he nearly killed some guy in the receiving bullpen when he found out he was there for animal abuse causing death, and all the guards loved em and he wasn't punished at all for it. The guard that was there also corroborated the story and other inmates were there when it happenened so it wasn't a boost.\n\nBuddy was a fuckin legend after everyone found out and completely changed my opinion of em (shouldn't judge based off looks, that was my mistake), needless to say he was never short of canteen. I still talk to em to this day, one of the most stand up people I know who won't stand for any kind of abuse of woman, animals, or any bullying at all.",

I remember next to nothing of the next hour, but a taxi driver found me and gave me a ride home then took my phone and tried to cash app himself a thousand dollars, ultimately getting through 2 separate $100 transactions.  He then harassed me the next week over text/call under a different name and number saying I owed him more.\n\nFrom an American medical bill perspective, I am kind of glad he didn't call an ambulance - but that would have absolutely been the correct thing to do in that situation.  Instead they took advantage of me, dumped me off then tried to blackmail me into paying even more.  I ultimately, magically got the cash app transactions reversed by customer service.

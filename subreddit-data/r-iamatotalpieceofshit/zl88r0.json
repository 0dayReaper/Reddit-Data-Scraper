The police rolled up a couple of minutes after this picture, popped the door, and got the kids out. \n\nSecurity said they'd have broken the glass if the kids weren't inside (the truck was running so they could've moved it), so they waited for the police for the kids' sake.",

I had to get her in even as my car was trapped. \n\nThese people didn\u2019t even appear to be in the ED (offscreen to the right), they were in front of the hospital tower (pictured).  Maybe their loved one was dying in hospital proper. Maybe they were just really stupid. I don\u2019t know. But there were six other cars behind me trying to unload *their* loved ones at the ED. It just sucks that one person caused all this. \n\nThe whole situation was unfortunate and really emotional at the time, and I\u2019m just glad the police came in, got the kids out safely, and resolved the situation as quickly as they could.\n\nEdit: word",

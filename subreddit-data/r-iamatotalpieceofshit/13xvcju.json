My point was entirely hypothetical: lets say it was policy to leave a critically injured person without calling it in.

ACAB started with \n\nOrigins of ACAB, or \u201cAll Coppers Are Bastards\u201d arose from 1940\u2019s England during a worker\u2019s strike.\n\nBut the phrase really took off in the 1970\u2019s after the *Daily Mirror* used the phrase as a headline for a story about a teen the police had picked up, who had the phrase embroidered on his jacket after copying it from a Hell\u2019s Angel he saw on the street.\n\nMost people will say though that the Hell\u2019s Angel\u2019s are the ones who really took the phrase and spread it around, giving it so much popularity that it made the phrase more mainstream and not just something solely heard within the realms of the counter culture worlds of the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s. \n\nSo I\u2019d hardly say it was liberals who coined the term, especially considering it\u2019s a widely popular term. \n\nNot everyone who is pro-Union or goes on strike to protest working conditions is a \u201cliberal.\u201d Worker\u2019s rights used to be a pretty standard cause to fight for within the working class, no matter what side of the political spectrum you leaned towards.\n\nAnd if we attribute the Hell\u2019s Angels with coining the phrase, or at the least, popularizing it, then you\u2019d be foolish to view the Hell\u2019s Angels as \u201cliberal\u201d lol. \n\nAnd then there\u2019s also the fact that not everyone on the left is a liberal. In fact there\u2019s a lot of people on the left who don\u2019t care for liberals and liberalism as much as conservatives. It\u2019s important to realize that people can be left leaning and not a liberal.\n\nHell, even some right wingers use the term ACAB. They see being a fan of cops would be hypocritical to their beliefs in small government and stance on police states.\n\nReferring to the term \u201cACAB\u201d as a liberal term is pretty obtuse and ignorant. Lots of people, from various backgrounds, have held, and do hold, this stance.",

What caused them to figure out the person who died was evading a cop when he crashed? And why wouldn't the cop just say he didn't see him crash and concluded he got away. In my mind, I would think the cop told people about it and that is what did him in. Would be interesting to know",

I think they said a mile.\n\n- 'no video evidence' can be true, but only imply what your thinking. Maybe it should have been captured but deleted (state of mind), maybe it was literal - the _wreck_ wasn't on video, etc, etc.\n\n- He didn't radio or report the incident _at all_. This isn't much different than stumbling on a dead body and then denying you were there. It doesn't mean you killed them, but it will be a major factor in your prosecution/conviction because it also speaks to your state of mind.\n\n- Venturing into speculation that we'd eventually hear about- its possible they know when he crossed the state line and returned. Traffic cameras are pretty common.",

Clearly they must have some evidence or he wouldn't have been indicted. Not to say hes guilty, we haven't heard his defense, but if he was indicted it means that a grand jury* was shown enough evidence against him that a conviction is possible.\n\n*standard disclaimer: there are at least 51 different justice systems in the US and not all use a GJ to indict, but they are the most common.\n\nEdit- and to be clear. I'm not an impartial juror. I think hes guilty. We do need to follow the and give him a fair trial.",

That state police department  opened a secret or confidential investigation into officer misconduct or some other official term for not doing your swarn job. Now it looks like  his department fired him quickly and did not say wait till the facts come out  so they are washing their hands quickly not a good sign for him. To me if he was smarter and documented he lost the suspect and kept driving down the road, even if he slowed or stopped he would be able to clear him self since his body cam was off and no car had video. I would guess  he would have gotten away with it if he just kept to his story. But..... Human are stupid and their \ud83e\udde0 some time just have to share the details with out focusing on the ramifications.  something tells me he probably stopped and like most people these days had to send a selfie photos to someone of this stupid kids mistake. I would put money that those photos  got passed around the inner circle till someone outside of the brotherhood got the nerve they have seen enough. I'm not saying the victim was without blame for his own death heck I'm seriously glad he did not hurt anyone else on that day. But the officer should have called EMS and reported it. Now that department and all the cases that that officer is linked to that he might have done the right thing are now tarnished.",

Is that not a big deal that the cop did nothing to help him? \n\nAlso yeah for felony stops they tend to continue into other jurisdictions a hit and run is not a felony in most places unless their were injuries to the party that was hit, which according to this news broadcast they didnt report any injuries. \n\nThis was just a overselous cop who let his emoitions and adrenaline take over. He then actively tried to cover it up by turning off his emergency equipment and turning around and driving back into town without a word to anyone. \n\nI also agree if the cop had stopped and given aid this wouldn't even be a story other than \"Man dies in crash running from police\" but he chose to try and avoid being involved for some reason, which makes me speculate that the cop knew he did/was doing something wrong. \nIm glad the state police investiagted and found him to be in the wrong as well. I dunno why were arguing the semantics of the OPs headline vs whats presented in the story.\n\nAt the end of the day the basic known facts are simple.\n\n1.Cop initiated traffic stop on the 22 year old.\n\n2. The 22 year old runs and leave the town/state (granted only 2 miles total from the initial stop attempt). Its still in another jurisdiction and a completely different state where officer Savage was not a sworn police officer. \n\n3. The suspect crashes off road during the pursuit.\n\n4. Officer savage turns off all emergency response items (lights sirens etc). \n\n5. Officer savage turns around and drive back into his jurisdiction not saying a word to anyone about it.\n\n6. At some point during or after the accident the 22 year old dies of his injuries since he was left on the side of the road.\n\n7. Some other police force (state police) investigated the death and found officer Savage to be responsible.\n\nIm sure theres a lot more evidence the state police have if they presented charges than what is reported.",

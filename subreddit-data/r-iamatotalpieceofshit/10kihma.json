The woman in black and white uniform received a fine (R$ 100,00 in Brazil's currency, roughly 15 dollars in today's quotation*) and a 1 year ban from playing/attending official matches... She was a cashier at a local supermarket and futsal was only a side job where she played mostly for fun... She eventually issued an apology for \"losing her temper\", and in her defense, said that not only her team was losing 8x1, but also said that the woman in orange was being disrespectful, dancing and teasing while playing\n\nEdit: The other two women in orange who tried to beat her also received the same fine, but only one was suspended for 4 games...\n\nEdit 2: This got way more attention than I was expecting, so I'll update and rectify some of the information after a more thoroughly internet search on the matter\n1) I've added quotes to the \"losing her temper\" remark as this was literally her words as to why she did it. \n2) Considering the dollar to real rates at the time, the fine would be actually close to 28/29 dollars, still a ridiculous low amount of money for an act that could've killed someone over a futsal match. Honestly, she should've been banned for life. \n3) Regarding any criminal repercussions, I couldn't find anything, but she clearly assaulted her and here in Brazil that could be up to 5 years in jail, as the attack didn't result in any kind of permanent injury.\n4) Finally, about the woman who was attacked, the only interview I could find was held a year after the incident, where she mostly talked about how the video went viral and that she received a lot of offers bc of it, she also kept playing futsal for a while... She's currently playing field soccer.",

Since monthly wage was like $240 usd at the time. \n\nSo it'd be like a $400 fine if you where a McDonald's worker in the US. Could be the difference between making rent that month, or 2 weeks dieting.\n\nEdit. Minimum wage was $240 USD A MONTH that's $1.50 an hour pre tax to an American working full time, 40 hours a week. Also the cost of living for 1 person there was around $4-500usd a month.\n\nEdit 2: if what she did was in the US it would have been a $500 usd charge so... not much different. Like 2 days wages.\n\nEdit 3. Soccer was a paying job. She lost 1/2 her income for 1 year ontop the fine",

First of all, she ended up forgiving the other girl because she ended up realizing she didn't mean it to go that way, it was just a passionate yet incredibly sloppy play. Pro athletes sadly get hurt all the time.\n\n\n\nThe real problem was she was supposed to be on a health plan provided by the team but got kicked off of it and then the team disbanded. She had legitimately zero recourse. If it weren't for a support network and dumb luck she'd probably still be dealing with crippling head trauma. I'll try to find her on Google, pretty sure she wrote a book about it.\n\n\n\nEdit: Briana Scurry. So desperate she pawned her gold medals.",

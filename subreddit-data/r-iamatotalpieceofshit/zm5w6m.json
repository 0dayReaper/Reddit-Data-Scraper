Most charity's have to have a clear specified plan and cause you go towards helping. Then obviously you need to document things and do the work of the charity whike possibly getting more members and workers. Also you'd ha e to follow laws of your state that go over charity work and ownership.\n\nBut I'm guessing you think you can call it charity and pocket the money and expect that's what rich people do ?",

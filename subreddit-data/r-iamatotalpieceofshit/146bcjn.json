Then few days later he guns down another man inside a smoke shop in full view of surveillance cameras and like ten people. And walks away after a coup de grace headshot. Is picked up by cops, and is back in jail few weeks later. Those two extra murders were unnecessary and as far as cops know he has done more. The victims families need to sue city...",

It is not perfect and it needs to be reformed but making it harder to get out of jail isn't a solution. People already spend way too much time locked up with no trial. \n\nDo you know how many people plead guilty to crimes they didnt commit because they have no other way of getting out of jail? If you do not have money *and* property to put up you can either sit there for 8months - 3yrs and wait for your trial or you can plead out. \n\nUltimately this is about money. We need more money for our court system and less for enforcement. Ending the drug war would go a long way to solving this issue.",

                            "comment": "I was replying to your other comment where you said getting charged is a low bar but will reply here since you covered a lot of important points agree with. \n\nGetting charged isn\u2019t a low bar to clear, or at least in theory it shouldn\u2019t be.  For a defendant to get charged the state has to show its more likely than not the defendant committed the crime.  It\u2019s the preponderance of the evidence standard, basically means if 51% likely vs 49% not you didn\u2019tthen you\u2019re indicted.  It\u2019s the same standard that civil court uses for judgements.  In theory it should be just as hard to indict as it is to win a lawsuit.  But in practice our system so heavily stacks the deck against defendants in favor of prosecutors that often defendants get charged when the evidence isn\u2019t close to making it 51% likely.   \n\nThere needs to be more accountability for prosecutors who bring cases not supported by the evidence.  There is hardly ever any repurchasing for them and that\u2019s part of the reason for the problem, another is that most judges are former prosecutors.  \n\nThe reason we have the system we have is because the bail lobby is extremely powerful and almost always defeats efforts at reform.  Cash bail wasn\u2019t a think in the US until the 1890s.  Prior to that you got bail for everything except capital crimes like murder.  In murder cases it was at the discretion of the judge whether to grant bail.  I think that\u2019s the system we should go back to.  \n\nThe 1 other thing, I think you\u2019re right to phrase the question as \u201cwhy is he enjoying his presumption of innocence?\u201d  But it\u2019s important to weigh that consideration against \u201cwhy is the public being subjected to the risk that the defendant allegedly poses?\u201d  \n\nBut the rest of what you said about the system getting innocent people to plead guilty out of desperation is 100% on point.  It\u2019s sickening.  But I think it\u2019s really important to distinguish case like this, a brutal execution where there is supposed becaise they wouldn\u2019t want      edly an admission of guilt at some point from the types of cases alot of those guilty pleas of desperation get made, that so much less serious and where concerns for public safety to not come close to justifying pre-trial detention\n\nAlso couldn\u2019t agree more with you saying it\u2019s about money, courts have been chronically underfunded for a couple decades now.  Police are over funded, Delays are one of the consequences of that underfunding. \n\nLastly, I think the system would be alot more fair if we used the same system at the Brits where there are not separate groups of prosecutors and ciriminal defense attorney,  they\u2019re all 1 group- solicitors- and they take turns switching from prosecution to defense.  That way prosecutors would be reluctant to pull some of the shady things they\u2019re known for doing .  end of rant",

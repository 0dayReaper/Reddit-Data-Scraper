And the \"tons of paperwork\" you do is a transfer and the trust that gets setup with the ATF, which I mentioned. I don't approve of the 86 ban or the 34 registry either but the information I provided was accurate lol. I just didn't want people spreading more false crap cause they don't actually know anything about guns or their laws. To say machine guns are illegal is a total lie. A Mac 10 is about 5-7 grand. I've spent more on a long range setup that isn't even a regulated firearm.",

For some of the people with bigger pockets, the hpa engine is a modification done to the m4 that allows for the very high rate of fire. It\u2019s a tried and true set up, very common all across the Airsoft community. What happens here was a \u201cmag dump\u201d and usually is warranted and if not is usually handled by the players and staff if able to. The community\u2019s are small and the regulars really pay attention to these videos and if anything happened to a random person, I assure you, the regulars at the field wouldn\u2019t let them stick around for long. We used to have a field cat at my local field, Rip dog. someone shot him few years ago before a game started. He thought it was real funny yet a lot of people took note and weren\u2019t very amused. When everyone got out to the field, his entire team turned around and mag dumped him right when the game started. He never came back.",

With that in mind I\u2019ve been lit up before and it felt like getting attacked by a bees nest, which has also happened to me before LOL. On HPAs you can turn the pressure up on them, which changes the FPS. 500 is usually the max for snipers at fields, at mine HPAs are limited to 380fps but players can and do change it after they get it FPS tested. One time I was hit in the neck and it was substantially more painful than any other single time I\u2019ve been shot. I had the wind knocked out of me, I just walked in circles for about 10 minutes of intense pain. I suspect it was either metal bbs/something like that or an HPA with the air pressure turned way up.",

Of course they got lifeban but its only a matter of time before it happens again. These people are senseless.",

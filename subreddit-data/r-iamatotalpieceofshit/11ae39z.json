There is absolutely zero reason to do what you did it cost you nothing to just let this thing be there. No everybody in their life has a decision to make and it seems you have chosen the life of douche baggery. I hope your left sock is forever wet for myself I hope there are always crumbs in your bed and I hope every time you get a new pair of shoes somebody steps on those hoes. No but really I hope you get hit by a bus that was unnecessary and you just being a dick. Even notorious taggers in Los Angeles wouldn\u2019t touch a good mural because they have something called respect. You obviously have none I hate people like you. I really hope you\u2019re fucking proud of that.",

I can't think of many other lines of work where your failures and mistakes are broadcast so publicly and so often compared to the day to day work you do which is pretty much ignored. I look at my colleagues in the ambulance and fire service and typically you will only see some bad publicity if they screw something up at a very severe level.\n\nThe vast majority of domestic abuse incidents that are attended usually end up with the victim denying any allegations or withdrawing any kind of support for prosecution. You can then have common scenarios where you go to deal with the suspect because you have enough to arrest them and the victim ends up getting aggressive and violent. It then becomes a nightmare to land any charges against the suspect in most circumstances...and then we run the risk of getting lambasted for trying to go ahead without victim support. Caroline Flack in the UK is a good example of that.\n\nMost often with Domestic Abuse, it's rarely something the police can solve until the victim is ready to take action and sadly that is often not the case.",

Do you say that as an attorney you\u2019re sure every other person in the justice system would side with your reasonable assessment?\n\nFox News gets away with so much just from \u201casking questions\u201d. \n\nWhen I was a young teenager and I called the police because my much larger and twice my age step-father chased me down, waited outside the bathroom I\u2019d locked myself in, and then waited until my mom persuaded me to come out to jump in front of her and beat me, the officers played it off as nbd and totally ok because I had called him a bad name (mf), even though it was from 60 feet away and clearly not \u201cfighting words\u201d\n\nEdit: not that this anecdote is precisely analogous, but my point is that it all depends on which officers of the law/court you happen to encounter. I agree that what you\u2019re saying is totally correct, but it\u2019s all just \u201cin theory\u201d until you\u2019re sure someone will actually stick up for your rights.",

He could of waited until he got home to toss the restaurant bag in the trash. I constantly see people tossing their cigarette butts outside their window. It\u2019s disgusting and can lead to fires. Countless times I\u2019ve had to call 9/11 and report a fire on the side of the interstate because some idiot decided to toss out their cigarette out the window.\n\nBesides, smoking is deadly anyhow.

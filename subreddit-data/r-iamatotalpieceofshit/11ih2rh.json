In the US they're easy to get and they make acts of violence more likely to result in death. Suicide is deadlier in the states too because of the same reason. One pull of the trigger is easier than slitting two wrists, requires a lot less effort than hanging, and is more consistent than pills.",

This likely led to a distrust of women and a feeling of victimization. The victimization is what leads to them being like *herpdy derp* what about men. \n\nOf course this is no justification these guys need therapy",

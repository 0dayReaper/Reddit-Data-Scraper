You'll see the image quality zoomed in to such a high degree while at 4k still offers perhaps even a fuzzy image, not as clear, crisp as it otherwise may be. \n\nIt'll take you less then 2 minutes to check, heck, skip the recording part and just zoom in on something mundane like a pair of curtains in your room. \n\nWhat I'd assume here is it's a high placement camera for overall full pitch views and not one of the lower tiered cameras for mid-level or side of the pitch action cameras. With the extra distance and being the one who had position to record the jerk, he got what he could.",

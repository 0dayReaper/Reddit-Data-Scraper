The previous owners even got caught.**\n\n\nIt took place in in Sao Leopoldo, Brazil in 2020\n\n\"Luckily, just a day after the video was posted, people identified the poor three-legged dog in it. As it turned out, the Patas Geurreras animal charity had taken the dog in and renamed him TinTin. Later, people found out that TinTin was actually abandoned twice on the same day. The first time he was dumped, TinTin was brought back home after one woman found him on the street, believing he was lost. But, being absolutely cold-hearted and inhumane, his owner dumped him again.\"\n\n\n\"Someone else found him and took the poor soul to an animal sanctuary. The footage that was later shared on Twitter showed TinTin being cared for by the staff of Patas Guerreras. And it gets even better \u2013 in almost no time, the handsome dog found new loving owners. The charity that previously took care of TinTin said that he is doing \u2018exceptionally well\u2019, given the horrifying circumstances under which he was abandoned. They also noted that the disabled pooch is being showered with love and care by his new owners, just like he deserves.\"\n\n\"To everyone\u2019s relief, police officers managed to track down Tintin\u2019s previous owners. They admitted that they had abandoned the poor dog. Anderson Ribeiro, boss of the Secretariat of Animal Protection in Sao Leopoldo, passed his information over to police who confirmed their investigation on the charge of animal abuse and have called witnesses to testify. The penalty for animal abuse ranges from three months to a year in jail and a fine.\"\n\n**\"Luckily, TinTin seems to be as happy and healthy as ever. Cuddled by his new owners, the handsome boy seems to have finally found his forever home.\"**\n\nhttps://www.boredpanda.com/three-legged-dog-dumped-twice-finds-loving-home/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=organic",

Does is get locked up like a human or does it get euthanized like dogs currently do?\n\nWhat if my cat attacked someone\u2019s pitbull? Is my cat going to get locked up or put down?\n\nWhat if my neighbor kicked a stray dog for knocking over her trash can and tore up the trash all over the yard, AGAIN? Is she going to jail for assault.\n\nI accidentally ran over a dog last month, killed it, is that involuntary manslaughter. Am I going to jail?\n\nThe laws you are wanting only apply to a select group of anaimals and it\u2019s for a good reason. Pets are property, love them all you want to. Stay in reality.\n\nLast thought\u2026 the legal system has failed to protect people from being harmed by people and you want to shift more focus on animals.\nAnimals or children which would you put you protection efforts towards?? Don\u2019t forget small kids hurt animals also, animals hurt small children. Do you think before you reach for those karma points? Have some of mine and stay quiet. \nLet the down voting begin.",

You're not punishing the dog - but if the dog is someone else's pet, you punish the human owner for allowing the dog to get loose.\n\nYour cat attacked someone's animal and caused harm?  You're responsible as the owner.\n\nNeighbor kicked stray?  Not as serious as situations like OP's but could still potentially be a crime.\n\nAccidentally running over an animal?  If there's video footage showing you were not driving unreasonably, you're in the clear.  If there's footage showing you were speeding/driving recklessly, then yes.\n\nTo answer your last point, just because one injustice hasn't fully been solved doesn't mean another shouldn't be looked at.",

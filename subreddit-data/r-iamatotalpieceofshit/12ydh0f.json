And when a video comes out of them being trespassed for it then I'll be 100% in the comments saying, \"Everyone knows this is the rule at Disney to prevent others from doing it after.\"\n\nHave whatever rules you want for your property, that does NOT grant Disney employees the right to grab valuables straight out of someone hand. Disneys policies do not overrule the law. If anything this guy has put himself in a position to get fired by snatching their property like that.",

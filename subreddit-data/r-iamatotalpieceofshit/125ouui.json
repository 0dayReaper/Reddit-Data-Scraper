So if you intend on keeping on overtaking you'll most likely stick to the left lane because once you move over you won't ever make it back into the passing lane.\n\nThe clio is most definitely just agitated that OP is maintaining a safe distance in the passing lane. Thus trying to overtake on the right, which is illegal and dangerous.\n\nE: to clarify, he is overtaking, but also maintaining a safe distance with the car in front of him.",

Second, even if overtaking from the right was legal, it would have been illegal in this situation because at no point during this overtake safe distance to the car in front of the Renault could be assured. \n\nThat the cam driver also shortened the distance of the car in front of him was also not right and passive behavior would have avoided the aftermath. But if an accident happened during the overtake from the left, the Renault driver would have been completely guilty. \n\nAnd the signal activation doesn't give you any permission or right during the line switch. \n\nBut the cam driver should have let pass the Renault because a good driver is a passive driver who does not engage aggressively. Nevertheless, the Renault driver should not have permission to drive 1 metric ton of steel with this aggressive behavior on the street.",

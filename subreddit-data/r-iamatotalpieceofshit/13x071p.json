I\u2019m not talking about deceiving them in the belief of God, but in the belief that the money they give will go to help people in need. The liar, the cheat, the thief. This sack of garbage believes every word he says. Which actually makes very little sense because instead of answering the question he takes the opportunity to brag more about himself and his money. The Crystal Cathedral in Orange California in order to build its youth center and daycare facility made a deal with the city to buy up the land that was already occupied by home owners and low income apartments. The city declared it to be property of the city and state using a law that allows them to take peoples land and forces them to take a settlement which is much less than its actual value in order to build public things such as freeways, parks, etc. So the church that was privately owned used the city to steal the land from home owners and property owners to expand it. What kind of Christian forces people out of their homes, basically stealing the land from its owners to expand its facilities. Paying much less than they would get in the housing market. This pos says he doesn\u2019t like to fly commercial airlines with demons, this sack of garbage is the demon on the flight.  He looks and acts like a shady car salesman because that\u2019s all he is. He sells people a religion that he himself exploits for riches. Pos.",

The man threatens people with thinly veiled threats. \n\nIf he doesn't think it's wrong to keep the money he is given by the \"church,\" he speaks at he should really read the Bible. \n\nMatthew 19:23-26\nAnd Jesus said unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, It is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. And again, I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.",

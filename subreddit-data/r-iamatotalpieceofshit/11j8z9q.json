Someone suggested to me that I put my recollection of it on Reddit and someone could probably find it. I've done a basic YouTube search, but I didn't find it. The only other pertinent details I can recall is it was shot in Brinkley, Arkansas and I remember the jingle *\"Made In The USA!\"* \n\nMy fourth grade elementary class was picked to be in the commercial, so we were all on the school bus. The director kinda looked like Santa Claus in a Hawaiian shirt. My teacher told him that my dad was the local Walmart store manager (he was), so he gave me the lead role of Hot Nurse/Mom's Kid who got to shoot the smooch scene in some neighborhood house's front yard with the bus parked on the curb.\n\nI thought I'd been discovered. It was a whole \"A Star Is Born\" moment; right time, right place, a certain towheaded rapscallion charm, and just a wee bit of coincidental nepotism - all the ingredients for makin' it as a budding child star bound for Hollywood.\n\nI dunno what happened with all that. Leo DiCaprio gave better head, I guess.",

Anyone who does something like this isn\u2019t quite all there, regardless of the reasoning why. \n\nHowever, to your point, political arguments can and do actually cause people to snap mentally. We\u2019re talking about a subject that for many people is a confrontation and direct challenge to their core ideologies and who they identify as. That can deeply affect a person. My dad was having so many political arguments at one point years ago that it was a major catalyst to a mental breakdown to where he was literally hospitalized. No mental issues before or after. \n\nPeople can definitely go down a spiral where they dig deeper and deeper into their beliefs, arguing with anyone and everyone to a point where it literally causes them to snap - I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this was one of those cases.",

That goes against what a breakdown is. It is literally the breaking down of one's sanity, morals and typical behavior. I think it's holier-than-thou to claim you know how you'd act during a breakdown. When people snap and kill their kids, for example, they are NOT in a well state and don't abide by their usual morals.",

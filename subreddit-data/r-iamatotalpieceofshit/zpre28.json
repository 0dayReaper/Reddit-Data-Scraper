It's ridiculous because he literally just needed to register as a sexual offender in his new home and could have avoided the massive public backlash that fell largely on his wife's shoulders. She could have just said he messed up and is working towards redeeming himself but that would be admitting to herself that she married a sexual predator so instead she went full selfish ignorance mode and here we are. I feel bad for his victim having to deal with this level of disrespect from a very public figure that claims to care to for other women and wants to see women rise above the patriarchy. Minaj cares for herself only.",

Even when Hannibal Burress was calling him out before that, so many people (including myself, sadly) just didn't want to believe it. He was America's dad, it would be like finding out Mr. Rogers was a serial killer or something. \n\nMeanwhile, were you really surprised when it came out that Cardi B drugged and robbed dudes? Alongside that, there's definitely some issues with criminals just being allowed to continue making music in the rap industry. There's a good Dave Chappelle bit about how DaBaby literally shot and killed someone and it barely had any effect on his career. Then he said some hateful and ignorant stuff about the LGBTQ+ community, and people (rightfully) started blasting him.",

People like Steven Tyler and Jerry Lee Lewis (I know there\u2019s tons more). Then the Weinstein\u2019s of Hollywood have been doing it forever. \n\nIn regards to DaBaby he did kill someone but it was ruled self defense in court, so I don\u2019t really put him in the same category as the Chris Brown\u2019s and Bill Cosby\u2019s of the entertainment industry.",

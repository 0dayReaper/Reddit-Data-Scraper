I have seen about a few thousand other Indians in my time in the US, and most of them appear to be similar.\n\nI am aware of deep workplace hierarchies in India, which may spill over into American workplaces where a critical mass of workers are Indian origin. e.g., an unprofessional manager delegating non-work related chores to direct reports. Nothing to do with the caste system.\n\nI realize the Hindu caste system is both shitty and very glaring for western audiences. However, I would not over-attribute to it.",

Surnames, and language dialects, along with stuff like the clothing you wear, the food you eat and your religion.\n\nA comparable example might be wealthy vs not wealthy in the US. One easy way to figure out if someone comes from wealth or not is discussing Ivy league schools, or making jokes about the \"shitty Ivy schools\". Cornell is usually joked as the shittiest, followed by Columbia/Penn. Which is funny to outsiders because usually those schools rank very well, and often better compared to the other Ivy schools. Columbia is actually really good and often near the top of the group in terms of how good it actually is. But when discussed among socialites, it's considered to be trash. So that's a really easy way to figure out if someone is really in the group or not. The same thing goes with India's caste system. It's pretty easy to tell if someone is pretending or not.",

I asked her out and we dated a few times. What I didn't know was that she was actively hiding the fact we were dating from her family.\n\nWell, her family inevitably found out and she simply disappeared off the face of the planet. She didn't show up to work or her university and our mutual friends hadn't heard from her. I called and her cousin picked up and was told in no uncertain terms that she 'wasnt allowed' to date me because I was Korean and I would be killed if I went looking for her. \n\nThis was in Atlanta Georgia, USA in the late 90s, the idea of honour killings or this sort of thing was absolutely unheard of. I didn't even know how to respond to it and took it as just tough guy talk and I didn't get scared. But as time went on and I became a little more world weary and wise, looking back I realised that maybe I should have been a bit more scared than I was, and I hope she was only kept from me and not hurt in some way",

Regardless of if your skin is naturally darker or not if you work in the sun most of your day you will be darker than average. Combine that with generations of sexual selection for lighter skin tones amongst the upper castes and little to no marriage outside of your own caste and I'm sure the lower castes have darker skin on average. Obvs there are exceptions but I can see why prejudice based on skin tone could be common. But your caste is not assigned based on your skin tone rather your skin tone could reflect your caste.",

I literally know nothing about it and asking genuinely out of curiosity.\n\nHow do other people know what caste you are from? I mean, is it possible to just not tell people what caste you are from and pretend to be from a different caste? \n\nThere are one and a half BILLION people in India, I would imagine someone could go to a different area and disappear into a crowd and simply change your whole identity, maybe even move up a level in the caste system \n\nSure, you may not make it out up to the top, but what about a level or two? What if someone from a lower caste left India altogether?",

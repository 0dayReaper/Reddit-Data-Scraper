So it would entirely depend on how the judge felt about that fact (assuming they even know what tiktok is) in q civil case. A less savvy judge could easily be swayed to the plaintiff's side i would imagine. \"Yes your honor, this is an obviously dangerous trend online for kids to endanger others with wreckless abandon, film it and post it to a place called 'tiktok'. Yes your honor I agree we should set a precedent that this sort of behavior will not be tolerated.'",

Battery likewise is usually defined as loosely as touching someone with the intent to cause harm. Proving that intent here would be very difficult given that they were filming and there was a trend they were likely following.\nUnlike how tv may portray it and what mall karens would threaten, in most states, hitting someone on accident will rarely even incur charges of assault or battery. Here you might barely be able to make an argument for criminal mischief (defined in most states as willful and malicious destruction of property), but most likely the only legal avenue for the victim is to sue for Personal Injury and related damages (very commonly including emotional).\nCriminality usually requires the prosecution to be able to prove intent or at the very least, gross negligence. Again, because this was a trend and no prominent cases of people getting hurt were floating around yet, i doubt any prosecution would try to take on that case.",

Every day it hurts, even after physio, and I'm constantly anxious it'll invert again because of how weak the ligaments/tendons are. I've had so many sprains and strains in various places over the years (yay for EDS!), plus a couple of breaks, and I can confidently say I would take a break over soft tissue damage any day.",

I handle workers compensation claims and I fully acknowledge that every state is different, but in many states we absolutely can deny your claim if you test positive for drugs or alcohol, especially if there's any indication that the drug in question could've led you to injure yourself. This particular incident shown in the video wouldn't be denied, but you are definitely not unquestionably covered just because you're hurt at work. There are requirements that you must meet for it to be considered a work related injury.",

My employer fired me and I was unable to claim workers comp because they reason they fired me was totally unrelated to the drug test...per their plan.\n\nI had been told by management that as a courtesy we could give friends and family free(cheapo) wiper blades if they bought at least an oil change, so I had been doing so for years. They changed their minds and said I was stealing...\n\nno workers comp..\n\nfortunately the neighboring tire shop who was their direct competitor took me in at 2$ more an hour, and never had an issue with me.\n\ntldr: you can still miss out on workers comp if you get fired for an unrelated issue your employer finds to avoid paying after failing a drug test. totally illegal, but I didn't know at the time",

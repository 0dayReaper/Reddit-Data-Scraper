That is so soneone in a chair can get in and out of an accessible van with a side-loading ramp. For someone that is chairbound and in a vehicle, this is the only sort of space they can use unless they can find a space with another free space to one side which is not always available. This is literally the reason a space like this exists. Otherwise the chairbound person has to load out in the middle of the lot, and this assumes there is someone else to park the vehicle (yes, sone chairbound people drive with hand controls).\n\nSo this guy could park illegally anywhere and he does it here specifically? Pretty self-centered for a \"public servant\"...",

Film of a cop grabbing the guy and forcefully pushing him away in a wheelchair would look REALLY good on youtube and the local news. Maybe lock the wheels of the wheelchair to make t harder to move the chair without tipping it over.",

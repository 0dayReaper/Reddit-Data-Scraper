            "comment": "As an Australian and someone who lives sort of close to where this happened, it is pretty embarrassing that this sort of shitty news comes out. \n\nBack story from what I heard on the radio is that the lady was a resident at a nursing home for dementia patients. She was apparently walking around (using her walking frame) with a steak knife in her hand and yelling at a few people. I don\u2019t believe she was threatening people directly by waving the knife around but would not give it to the carers. \n\nPolice were called in and after a while of not being able to get her to give up the knife, some idiot decided that she was that much of a threat while moving towards them that she had to be tased. \nShe fell, hit her head fracturing her skull and ended up in hospital not quite on life support but couldn\u2019t regain consciousness. Died about a week later. \n\nThe three police officers are under investigation with the main one being stood down pending the investigation. I heard the other day that 3 charges are being put forward, one was causing grevious bodily harm, assault causing actual bodily harm and can\u2019t remember the third but it did not relate to her death which is bullshit. His taser deployment killed her and it should be seen that way. \n\nMy grandmother lives at a care facility for dementia patients and yes the elderly people that live in these homes can get a bit hard to handle from day to day but it broke my heart to hear that a 30 something year old man in a police uniform thought his only way to solve a situation with a 95 year old woman was to hit her with a taser. Obviously he wouldn\u2019t have anticipated her dying at the time but surely common sense would put some sort of manslaughter charge in somewhere.",

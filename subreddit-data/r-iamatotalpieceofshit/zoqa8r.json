Maybe come to him with a very silly set piece or gear that is set up incorrectly and calmly ask him to leave and when he turns around, he sees the people and the cake. Something harmless. I'm guessing this is a film set and the screamer is the director.  I work in film. We play pranks from time to time, mainly just silly things on PAs or people you are really close with in your department. But a director blowing up on his crew member in front of everyone like this is a big deal. I've seen it a few times and it ties my stomach into knots. It's not funny. Most take serious pride in their work and it's practically our whole identity and being. It's all we think about and talk about (seriously, we are probably annoying to hang out with. We can't talk about anything else if there are more than one of us in a room). This was cruel to send that guy into complete and total confusion and painful self doubt.",

They are a little behind in how we perceive thihngs like the internet... and when they see \"tik tok\" they think of it differently than we do. They probably saw people do these things and are trying to copy them, thinking this is a regular prank and is acceptable. They don't understand that it's going way too far because of their culture. I do agree that there is some sense of responsibility here, but they are truly people living behind us in a way, and they are just trying to mimic Western countries and how they use social media. African people have a HUUUUGE social media presence and I believe this was genuinely not meant to be so crazy as it seems. At least it did not go on long... and you have to wonder if they prank each other often to take the prank this far... maybe it needed to be so he wouldnt know.",

This is their nest. They are being bred purposefully, so making sure the chicks are healthy is paramount.\n\nThey may also be getting removed to be hand reared and imprint on humans -- This is extremely common and hand raised/fed parrots are more expensive, and typically better trained birds than ones reared by their natural parents. I say this is likely here, because of how featherless those babes are. They are *fresh* hatched, probably being removed for hand rearing. \n\nNobody pairs thousand dollar birds and gives them a breeding box by mistake -- These chicks are likely being hand raised to be trained and sold.",

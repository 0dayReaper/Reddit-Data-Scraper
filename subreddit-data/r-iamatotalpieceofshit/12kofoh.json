If you want 10-12 yr olds having those thoughts and worries on their head then I don\u2019t know what to tell you. I would rather let kids be kids for as long as they can. So did you watch the video and hear the passages from the books? And you think hey that\u2019s something they gotta see at some point let\u2019s give it to them at 11 yrs old!",

The books also go on to explain the consequences of the actions that take place giving the kid much needed perspective on sex and abuse.\n\nYou can't just expect that they won't be wondering about their sexality at that age.  If you do you are horribly out of touch.  \n\nThe fact that you find it pornograhic says way more about you personally then anything man.  Maybe stop thinking about kids going through puberty, it's kind of a sick thing to fixate on to be honest.",

It's over 400 pages long, so it's *not* aimed at children. It is massively disingenuous to say it is.\n\nThe same applies to The Art of Racing in the Rain at over 300 pages. Why are you so sexually repressed that a book that goes through a person's life, including relationships and sex, from the perspective of a dog, is somehow a porn? \n\nFurther research shows that you're likely being manipulated by the word pornographic because the law Utah is using to ban these books is using its own definition. Seriously, take a chill pill. Ten year olds are not reading these books in school. Hell, almost no teens are going to be reading these given the length.",

What do you think is the harm in them reading the book, if they are mature enough to dig into a 400 page book? Surely not more harmful than forcing them to participate in active shooter drills because the US refuses to do anything about school shootings. \n\nThis is just like conservatives up in arms over sex education and claiming that it's wrong to have sex ed in schools and insist on abstinence only education. Kids know about sex, and trying to hide it from them isn't going to stop them thinking about it.",

We hard an argument about this in the 1860s and the secessionists lost. \n\nMany cons include American citizens that wish to remain in America would be forced to move. Moving is expensive and not all will manage it, meaning they lose their citizenship and benefits.\n\nUS Federal buildings and bases would have to be evacuated and emptied, which is expensive.\n\nUS citizens would require a passport to travel to these states.\n\nPros include savings on the budget. Many Southern states receive more federal funds than they pay in taxes. \n\nBut like I said, it won't happen. There are secessionist movements in basically every state because extremists are always annoyed the state doesn't act like they want. These are generally far-right wing groups that don't like being told they can't be openly racist in governmental or business situations. As much as people like Marjorie Green talk about a \"national divorce\" the GOP would never support such an act because it would spell the death of their party in Presidential elections. Losing Texas and Florida's votes would mean no GOP president for decades to come.",

This weekend at my inlaws she slapped her brother. I told her again for the 437th time they're not allowed to hit you...dont touch them.  She did it agin.  I changed the rules. Told her if she hits her brother agin shes putting herself in a boys shoes and i will allow them to defend themselves. Im not sure how her grandfather felt about it ,as he heard me say it. Thankfully he respected me enough to allow me to lead my family and listened quietly. Even more thankful she didnt hit the boys anymore after that. Do your worst reddit!  Come for me!  Or praise me.... lets see what happens...\ud83e\udd78",

The reasoning *\"Well, she hit first. It goes both ways\"* is too weak considering how the wife only slapped to give Dana a clear message, not really to endanger Dana's life but some consider that enough justification to *hit back* just to vent out the dissatisfaction and feel satisfied at at the thought of hitting someone who's physically weaker (who did not even try to endanger your life) than you back. \n\nOf course, if the woman hits first without justification, then that is on the woman, though I wouldn't condone a man hitting back if the hitting was apparently too weak. \n\n\nI think the question shouldn't be whether or not who hits first, but rather **how much violence is enough/justified for someone who's stronger to retaliate aggressively against a woman physically weaker than them.**",

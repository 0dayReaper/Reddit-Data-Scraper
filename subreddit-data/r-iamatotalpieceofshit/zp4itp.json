We had a next door neighbor tear down her chicken coop and it released thousands of them into the surrounding yards. They were leaving mouse poop all over our deck where my kids were exposed to it. Destroying anything they could find. We set out glue and mouse traps for them. All traps checked daily. Glue traps were dipped in clove oil water. Killed the mice in seconds. I'd use them again if it ever got that bad. They were catching 10 mice a day. When they go from minor annoyance to health hazard you use whatever you need to to get rid of them.",

Imagine sticking your entire body in a thing of glue, pulling it out, and then drenching it in oil. Yes you'll mostly not be sticky on the outside anymore, but you've pretty much tarred and feathered yourself, the inner layers are still glued to you, you will basically immediately die if it's got or cold out because you won't be able to regulate your body temperature right anymore. \n\n\nAlso it doesn't address how animals will snap their legs and chew their limbs off trying to escape these.",

Walking in the store, there was no one but the clerk.  I then tried the bathroom and found it locked.  After getting keys from the clerk to unlock the door, I found the boys father on the floor convulsing and foaming from the mouth.  Went back out and asked the boy if he had any family he can call, in which he was able to call his grandpa.  The boy asked me to talk to his grandpa, who then desperately asked me to take the child and drive him across town before the police arrived.\n\nI had to deny that request as I'm sure taking a child away in your car is considered kidnapping, with or without the grandpas consent. Sad that the boy probably went to CPS.",

The dislike of oneself is def something that we try to change, even if we aren\u2019t changing ourselves but instead changing how we feel. Do things for yourself. If you\u2019ve been to 5 rehabs there\u2019s prob not much else I can tell you to help you.  For me, meditation really helped. I started that in jail and it just stuck. It helps makes sense of the world and the way I feel in it. I don\u2019t really know how to describe it but it helped me open my mind and my heart and helped me make better decisions. It is one day at a time that\u2019s for sure.  I was doing meth and fet too. It\u2019s a hell of a convo. Be safe out there, and when you\u2019re ready to stop you can and will. Try meditating and than journaling, just free writing. That helped me make sense of the way I was feeling too.  Some days are better than others, I still go through rough patches. I still struggle. But I am grateful to not have a habit anymore bc I am barely managing being able to pay my bills on my own. I don\u2019t have a husband bc while I was locked up, my fianc\u00e9 started doing really fucked up things and he ended up getting locked up for a long time. At the time I wanted to have kids. But I wasn\u2019t done getting high and I was so devastated I lost him that I spent another year getting high. Spent a lot of time in and out of the system.  Now I am just too old and gave up on relationships and I\u2019ll never have kids. Which I guess is for the best in this economy.  Sorry, sidetracked. Basically I guess I just can\u2019t afford to get high , because I will lose everything. And this is the most I\u2019ve ever had- my first lease/apartment/furniture. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s mine. I don\u2019t have anyone to help me but I don\u2019t have anyone to enable me either. But , you\u2019re right, it does take vigilance. Like when I get down on myself or depressed for whatever reason. I think that\u2019s all I have, is that thought that if I start using again I will lose everything. Maybe find your \u201cthing\u201d to help you. No pressure. You will when you\u2019re ready and I hope that you learn to love yourself soon, you\u2019re such a warrior and you deserve the world \ud83c\udf0e",

In our recovery, we may still have a tendency to pass judgment on others\u2019 actions because we think we know how that person should behave.   But as we progress in our recovery we often find that, to accept ourselves, we must accept those around us.\n\nIt may be difficult to watch as someone\u2019s insanity manifests itself.  But if we detach ourselves from the problem, we can start living in the solution.  And if we feel affected by another\u2019s actions, we can extend the principle of forgiveness.\n\nOur behavior toward other people in our life is a mirror of our behavior toward ourselves.  When we demand perfection of ourselves, we come to demand it from others around us, too.  As we strive to repair and heal our lives in recovery, we may also expect others to work just as hard and to recover at the same pace as we do.  And just as we are often unforgiving of our own mistakes, we may shut out friends and family members when they don\u2019t meet our expectations.\n\nWorking the steps helps us understand our own limitations and our humanity.  We come to see our failures as human mistakes.  We realize that we will never be perfect, that we will, at times, disappoint ourselves and others.  We hope for forgiveness.\n\nAs we learn to gently accept ourselves, we can start to view others with the same accepting and tolerant heart.  These people, too, are only human, trying to do their best and sometimes falling short.",

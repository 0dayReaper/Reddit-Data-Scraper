This overweight teenager complaining that slender hot girls won't date him and he shouldn't be \"punished\" for his preferences (because people were telling him to go for girls in his league).  However, he was a giant hypocrite, because HE shouldn't have to alter his physical preferences in a girl, yet he expected girls to alter their physical preferences in a dude to cater to him (Because he's a Nice Guy!).\n\nI hate to break it to some people, but man, there are a lot of really attractive dudes that are also nice guys.  These people act like being nice is some insanely rare personality trait.  It's the fucking standard man.",

I was so angry afterwards I turned to the crowds with their phones out and verbally had a massive go at everyone there for not standing in sooner. All ended up on news and police dogpiled the racists and they are now both behind bars \n\nKfc loved me, I got a lot of free food. The videos of me posted on social media however made me look like another punk in a restaurant. Lost a lot of faith in my common man that day",

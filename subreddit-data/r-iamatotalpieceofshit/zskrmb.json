He was drunk and all over the road. She cuffed him, another office showed up, they started going through the motions and their sgt called to let them know he was getting picked up. Right on the spot. No due process. No justice. There\u2019s a solid chance he\u2019s done it a million times before, and he\u2019ll do it again. \n\nI\u2019m all for covering for my friends, but like\u2026.these are legit crimes. Someone could have been seriously injured, or worse. There should be zero tolerance for this. :-/",

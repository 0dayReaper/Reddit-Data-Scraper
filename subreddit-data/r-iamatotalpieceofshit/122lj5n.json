I could see this happening where the deposit doesn\u2019t happen for a week or two and then the thief just happens to be in the right place at the right time.",

If the person took the $15k without permission or without intending to return it, they could be charged with theft.\n\n&gt;Additionally, Georgia has a \"Duty to Act\" statute (O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-5-20), which states that any person who \"knowingly and willfully\" fails to provide reasonable assistance to someone they know is in need of help can be charged with a misdemeanor. If the person knew that the cashier was in distress and failed to provide any assistance or call for emergency services, they could potentially be charged with a misdemeanor under this statute.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, Georgia has a \"Good Samaritan\" law (O.C.G.A. \u00a7 51-1-29), which provides protection from civil liability for individuals who render aid in an emergency situation, as long as they act in good faith and with reasonable care. However, this law does not provide immunity from criminal prosecution.\n\n&gt;In summary, the person who stole $15k while the cashier was dying in Atlanta, Georgia could potentially be charged with theft and \"failure to act\" or \"failure to rescue\" under Georgia law",

If the person took the $15k without permission or without intending to return it, they could be charged with theft.\n\n&gt;Additionally, Georgia has a \"Duty to Act\" statute (O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-5-20), which states that any person who \"knowingly and willfully\" fails to provide reasonable assistance to someone they know is in need of help can be charged with a misdemeanor. If the person knew that the cashier was in distress and failed to provide any assistance or call for emergency services, they could potentially be charged with a misdemeanor under this statute.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, Georgia has a \"Good Samaritan\" law (O.C.G.A. \u00a7 51-1-29), which provides protection from civil liability for individuals who render aid in an emergency situation, as long as they act in good faith and with reasonable care. However, this law does not provide immunity from criminal prosecution.\n\n&gt;In summary, the person who stole $15k while the cashier was dying in Atlanta, Georgia could potentially be charged with theft and \"failure to act\" or \"failure to rescue\" under Georgia law",

I know someone who was in obvious need of an ambulance due to needing urgent medical attention - and despite him being hospitalized for two weeks and having last rites offered before he finally came around, NO his 15 min ambulance ride was NOT covered by his insurance, and it cost thousands of dollars. So yes, when I got hit by a car I refused an ambulance ride with that in mind\u2026",

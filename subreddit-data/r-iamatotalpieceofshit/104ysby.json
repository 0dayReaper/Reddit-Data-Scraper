I can\u2019t imagine if that was one of my kids. \nSylvia Seegrist\u2019s mom used to shop at the store I worked at as a kid. She was a sweet lady and I always felt bad because people would whisper and point when they saw her. No matter how hard you try sometimes your kids still end up being monsters.",

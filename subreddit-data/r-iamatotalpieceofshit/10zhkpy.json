            "comment": "The actions of the superintendent disgust me.  The article goes on to mention that they didn't contact the police after the incident because it went against school policy.  The girl was attacked by multiple students.  I consider that to be a gang assault, which schools generally aren't qualified to handle properly.  Part of me thinks that they were trying to keep things as quiet as possible, but the video being shared, followed by the girl taking her life, ruined any chance of that.  They want to shift the blame now on to the family, which I don't see working out too well",

Don't know what kind of drugs she took, if she ever took someone, but it's the worst to talk about it to a newspaper.\n\nImagine being bullied every freakin day and noone helps her, not even the freakin school, who could suspend all the attackers. I totally understand that girl, got bullied too and sometimes enough is enough. I got help and she didn't. This poor girl deserved better treatment",

The principal\u2019s solution? To move my son from that classroom onto another. I told her she was being ridiculous, why would I punish my son by removing him from his favorite teacher and friends when he is the victim.

I have no doubt that the school could've done better, but the headline of this article is ridiculous. The principal is not \"shifting \"blame\" to anyone. He is saying that there are other very significant contributing factors to this suicide that were not the school's fault.

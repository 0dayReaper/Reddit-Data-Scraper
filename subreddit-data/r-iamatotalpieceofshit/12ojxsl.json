They ask that nothing is left out two weeks before Memorial Day and Veterans Day. Those are the busiest days and so they do a deep clean leading up to them and don't want stuff in the way. Memorial/Veterans Day, leave whatever you want. Lots of child graves get toys, some people might leave a can of beer for an old friend, etc. One lady brings a bottle of her mom's favorite kind of wine, drinks one glass, and then leaves the rest. They do ask that you pick your stuff back up within a week or they will toss everything that isn't real flowers in a vase that's permanently part of the headstone. Why? Well, here on the great plains, it gets pretty windy. It's windy more than it isn't. Today we gusts over 50 and no one thinks twice about it. It all blows away, but at least the real flowers with degrade eventually",

I worked at a funeral home during college as an administrative assistant/receptionist, part time.\n\nHonestly I thought there was something wrong with me because I stopped feeling the sadness, I would get irritated with grieving families who were being unreasonable or rude (grief can do that), and sometimes I would catch myself becoming overly casual in a conversation (it\u2019s important to let the bereaved lead the conversation, but your response should still be largely professional and inoffensive even if theirs may be morbid or silly\u2026 again, people deal with grief differently and even if their words feel okay your words might not). I lost my dad so I have some idea of how this all works. It\u2019s also why I applied.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t my responsibility to clean the grounds but sometimes I helped. At first I just felt sad about the graves with nothing. But then I realized that was silly, because my dad\u2019s grave is in Israel. I\u2019m across continents, not exactly easy to say hi and leave a token that I\u2019m there. \n\nFast forward a few years and the desensitization is gone. But I have no doubt it would be back if I started working there again. I preferred having it but I hated getting to that point, if that makes sense.",

I don't remember the exact story there, to be able to tell you if there was any rationality to that decision at the time or not. I can tell you that it was stored in Texas due to the hydrocarbon industry leaving empty chambers underground which at one point contained natural gas. Said chambers made for a conveniently easy place to store helium with minimal cost and leakage.",

The helium used in party balloons makes up an insignificant amount of total helium usage. Like in fractions of a percent.\n\n2. The helium used in party balloons isn't even the right kind for use in medical/scientific devices\n\n3. We aren't actually running out of helium, we are running out of our helium *reserves*. This is because before the 1970's, only the government was allowed to extract and stockpile helium. Once that restriction was lifted, there was no point to keeping the stockpile, so they started selling it off in the 90's because...\n\n4. Helium is a byproduct of natural gas extraction. It is so common and cheap that most companies don't even bother capturing it. If the availability were to drop and price were to rise, you can be certain that more places would start saving it. \n\n5. Hydrogen is a horrible alternative for helium when it comes to lighter-than-air applications. Along with being extremely hard to contain for long periods of time, it is flammable. Super flammable. Look up the Hindenburg for a good example of just how flammable it is. A balloon of hydrogen is essentially a small fire bomb.",

A good wind, a nosy deer...they're coming out of that base. Then I guarantee the grounds team is tossing them from wherever they end up. Most people do not know how to secure flowers in headstone vases.",

            "comment": "I could almost guarantee those are being removed by grounds keeper or animals. Birds will take flower stems for their nest. Real flowers die and make the graves look horrible. Maintenance people routinely go around the cemetery throwing them away.\n\nIf they are fake, 99% of the time, they aren't UV resistant. After a few or so, they look moldy yellow and brown and are thrown away so the graveyard doesn't look like a dump. Even if they are UV resistant, they get dirty. They also get blown out from wind, and then the ground keeper gets to pick them up. It's not a big deal with one grave, but when there are thousands, it becomes an issue.\n\nEdit: Please do not attempt to plant flowers by graves. They will 100% be removed unless you have been authorized. It takes a tremendous amount of time and money to maintain the green grass and landscapes in cemeteries. \n\nSource: I did maintenance at a cemetery. Unless you're leaving valuables (not flowers or vases), almost no one is stealing things off graves. Please consider making a small donation to a worthwhile cause in memory of your loved ones instead of plastic flowers or real flowers that will quickly need to be thrown away.",

The Protestant one is only like \u00a320 but the Catholic one which is attached with one manky looking gate is like \u00a350 and they shame you on the facebook page. One of my aunts tried to spread wild flowers on my grandmothers grave in the Protestant one and she's no longer allowed to visit without supervision because she wrecked all of the surrounding graves. Pretty nice graveyard though, they've got some &lt;1600 graves and some of the tombs have frogs living in them.\n\nThe Baptist church doesn't have a public graveyard, just two headstones for a Father from ages ago and a school teacher who died in WW2 but you physically cannot reach them without two sets of keys. Can't even leave flowers in a vase, can't get to them without the churches permission.",

I called my grandmother Mawmaw, and her mother was my Mamaw (different pronounciation). But where I'm from, you might also find Meemaw, Mimi, Gram, Grammaw, or Nana (I've even heard Nawnaw).\n\nNow, you could say, \"That's my mommy's house,\" and that would be the correct spelling because that's not a proper noun. But you could also say, \"That's Mommie's house,\" and it becomes a proper noun, which you can spell any way you want to. Note that you could still say \"That's my Mommie's house,\" and still have it as a proper noun. (Edit: In OP's note, it does look like \"Mommie's\" is capitalized)\n\nAs a side note, some folks in the comments have mentioned calling their grandmothers Mommie or Mama.\n\n(Another edit because autocorrect messed up and put an apostrophe in the word grandmothers)",

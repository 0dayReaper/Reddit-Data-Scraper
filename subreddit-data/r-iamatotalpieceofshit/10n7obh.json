I have nightmares almost every night of being shot or shooting back at people. I fucking hate it too..

Im simply trying to say abolishment is not the solution. \n\nSo, what is the actual solution? We can sit here and say there is problem until our faces turn blue, that does absolutely nothing to bring about the change that needs to take place. I know how to seize all movement within our country, how to shut it down, but we need viable solutions before we take that action.",

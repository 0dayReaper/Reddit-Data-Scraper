We all have many personal freedoms, but we still have to follow rules to exist within a the large system of people that we call society. Unfortunately, we've also seemingly lost the ability to fully comprehend systems, which is a direct result of our educational and cultural systems embracing extremely simplified thinking. Everything is simplified down into very basic \"yes / no\" thinking. Being told to do anything then becomes tantamount to overt oppression. At this point, things are dumbed down to the point that \"individual freedom\" now simply converts into contrarianism... partly due to lack of understanding, partly due to frustration and rage, partly due to our culture having the idea of the outsider rebel who contradicts norms as the ultimate cultural hero shoved down its throat for the last 30 years.",

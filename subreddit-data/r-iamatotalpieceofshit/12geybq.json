They don't do anything about burglaries and robberies.  They don't walk the streets in uniform to deter crime.  They've publicly announced they won't enforce noise complaints in my city.  They've reduced traffic enforcement and you can see the traffic deaths go up as a result.  \n\nAnd that's just how I feel as a white guy, just for not helping.  I know there's other people out there that they're actively hurting too.\n\nI'm not saying all cops are bad, maybe yours are better.  I haven't heard anything about cops being bastards in Helsinki.  \n\nBut here?  If we keep paying them more despite their job performance getting worse, that's stupid, and we get exactly what we deserve.  \n\nWhat are we getting for our dollar?

So they can suit up against a protest, and roll armored Humvees down residential streets, shooting projectiles hard enough to break bones at people sitting on their porches? And that's really the only scenario I can think of where this stuff has ever been necessary. Nobody does massive bank heists anymore, there are very few massive shootouts these days between cops and criminals. The only things they use this equipment for is dispersing protests, and raining down on the locations of suspected drug dealers.\n\nMy neighbor's a crack dealer, there was ***5 ARMORED SWAT TRUCKS*** parked outside my house the day they raided him and dragged him into custody. He didn't even resist, he came out of his house when told, knelt down, and then when they handcuffed him, they proceeded to ***drag him across the yard and street*** to the police car he was transported in. When they stood him up for him to get into the car, he tried to lean down to get in, and one officer jabbed him in the gut with the butt of his rifle (I would assume full auto), and they picked him up by the chain of his handcuffs and his ankles and tossed him in on his stomach. What's even the point of that? And when they saw me, my mom, and her boyfriend all watching from the living room windows, they got these super pissed looks on their faces, and afterwards tried to come banging on our door. Door's still cracked from that.\n\nIt's ridiculous. They're drilled with an Us vs Them mentality from day one, and people wonder why others have issues with the police.",

Police don\u2019t exist to protect and serve, nor do they serve wealthy property owners. \n\nPolice serve to maintain the monopoly of violence that the state has. At the end of the day they prioritize violent people and anyone the state views as a threat. \n\nProperty crime is obviously going to get ignored because they have bigger fish to fry.

Which is crazy bc most of us go to work and don\u2019t get to pick and choose what parts of work we don\u2019t want to do. \n\nLong story about an experience with NYPD: \n\n\nThe first time I went to NYC we were in Manhattan, we were at a huge lounge where my wallet was stolen. \n\nThe body guard/bouncer had the theft on camera. We went to the police precinct right after the theft. The police refused to look for anything or help until a police report was filed, but NYPD refused to take a police report until I had some sort of ID although my wallet was just stolen and I was from out of state. \n\nThey were very rude, smug and unhelpful. There was nothing going on bc it was 2:00A in the morning and they weren\u2019t busy. \n\n\nI had to call my mom and wake her up so she could send me a copy of my birth certificate. Once they got it they still farted around for another 45 minutes, when they decided they\u2019d finally take a police report.\n\nI got lucky bc I didn\u2019t have cash and minutes after my wallet was stolen I cancelled my cards. Luckily the bouncer never stopped looking, he came to the precinct and brought everything he found- so I was able to get my cards back, although they were cancelled but mostly I was able to have my Id back so I could fly home. \n\nThe police were upset bc I didn\u2019t need to or want to stay to complete the police report. After the bodyguard came in and made them look as inept as they were!\nNow all of a sudden they wanted any sort of credit like they did something",

Reporting officer basically had a \"well luckily no one got hurt\" and shrugged his shoulders. When I asked can't you just use the toll cameras to get the guy in like 30 seconds since you knew the make, model, and color of the vehicle that is now missing a side mirror and has body damage? He just laughed and said oh no we don't have the resources for that. \n\nIgnoring the thousands of dollars of damage that was done to my wife's car that we now had to deal with insurance for, odds are the guy took off because he was either drunk, high, or was in possession of some kind of stolen property or has a warrant for his arrest. Wouldn't that be a pretty good reason to try to find out why he ran if you're a cop?",

My dad was out at a bar when a guy grabbed his jacket and left. We pulled up the security cameras and you couldsee the guy walk out of the bar, put on the jacket on the porch, and walk away. Had my dad's wallet and phone with it. I called the police and said we were tracking a stolen phone and wanted a police officer, so they sent one down. He checked the find my phone app I had pulled up and knocked on the door of the apartment. A lady and her kids came to the door and we saw the dude just crashed in the couch wearing the jacket as a blanket. Lady handed it over and we just went on our way. Dude was clearly just shitfaced and probably didn't even realize he took a jacket.\n\nSomething I've been told though is to let the police know you are in the action of something right now. Whether you're going to retrieve the phone, or if someone hit your car and sped off, tell them you are chasing the driver, etc. They probably won't care about some small incident that can be solved in civil court but probably would want to be involved if someone could get shot and killed. I of course wasn't about to confront some guy at 2AM in a shitty neighborhood, but the police don't know that.",

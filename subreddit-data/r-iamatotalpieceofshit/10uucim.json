Kept getting bullied in Day of Defeat source cuz it was in my user name and I liked to play Axis because of their guns... took me a while of dealing with team killing and admins booting me from lobbies before I learnt why a 14 year old  with 88 in their name wanting to always play axis looked REAL bad...\n\nClarification. When I'd ask to switch teams, people would ask age (because they where usually nicer to younger people about that) and when I'd respond 14, they would think I was a racist troll.\n\nEdit for even more context that made it real bad. My original handle that I changed after learning this. Andneo88. Start of my name, neo from the matrix (I initially made the gamer tag in 2004). 88, my fave number.\n\nSo 6 years later it understandably looked REAL bad when  andNeo88 types 14 in chat. Wanting to be Axis. As a result the tag has been retired since 2010, and the corresponding email is in the hands of some Russians last I checked.\n\nThat is how racism ruined my first gamertag.

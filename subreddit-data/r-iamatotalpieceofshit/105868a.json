Either you have never riden a bicycle, and you've been the person break checking a cyclists or you are just dumb because if you say and cause a problem. You are the fucking problem. \n\nImagine I break check you, and you're on a motor bike, and I say, \"Oh well, you didn't leave enough breaking distance, especially if I slam on the breaks.\"\n\nThat's my 2c or 2pents if you will.

I was on the bus (double decker) and was one of 2 or 3 who wasn't injured on the bus (the bus driver checked everyone was ok, they weren't there was loads of blood) then as he got off the bus, he keeled over with a massive heart attack. \n2 of the passengers in the car died. The police prosecuted the driver of the car. I had to attend court and the coroners inquest (which was a year later) \n\nI've been brake checked by a car going down hill in gale force winds and heavy rain. The SUV overtook me then pulled across the cycling lane and slammed his brakes on. Fortunately I managed to stop in time. Caught up with him at the lights at the bottom of the hill, he was in the right hand filter lane, I was going left. Really unfortunate that my pedal left a scratch down the side of his car...\n\nEdit: BEFORE I GET DOWNVOTED .. AITA? Don't care. I'm a husband, a dad and a human being. I was in the cycle lane. The driver of the car deserved the damage to his car",

It's because of the danger posed by a car being far greater.  \nBut also you're just straight up incorrect. You see it this way because it negatively impacts you to have to go around a cyclist but you haven't considered that their safety is more important than your convenience. In the gutter you're easier to go unnoticed, can get boxed in, and will struggle to turn right as drivers think you're cutting across them rather than already in front of them.  \nCentre of the lane is literally called primary position, which is encouraged in slower urban roads (like this one). Specifically to ensure visibility and prevent people passing in unsafe locations.  \nAbout a meter off the kerb is secondary position and generally used when the cyclist deems the section of road safe for a driver to pass, or on faster roads where it's more likely a driver will need to.",

There is no way to disprove this.\n\nThey could also argue that there was a legitimate reason that he got the brakes as hard as he did, for example a cat ran into the street and he panicked. The video doesn't show the front of the car so, again, it's hard to disprove \n\nWith all of these points I really can't imagine anyone taking the cyclist seriously even if he tried to get some compensation.",

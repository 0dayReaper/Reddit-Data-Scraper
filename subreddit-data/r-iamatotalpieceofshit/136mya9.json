They then came to my job and handcuffed me in front of everyone I worked with. They took me to a squad car where they told me they killed her and closed the door. They did this \"for my safety, and for the safety of their officers\" they then brought a female officer to uncuff me and release me. Not only what they did was horrible, but how they handled it afterward was even worse.",

A friend of mine grew concerned when she couldn\u2019t reach me and told her mum, who unbeknownst to me, called the police. The pills were just starting to hit when I heard several angry voices threatening to break down the door if I didn\u2019t answer. I managed to drag myself down the hall to unlatch the lock and let them in. Five cops swarmed me, kneeled on me, and tightly handcuffed my bleeding wrists, threatening to taze me if I moved a muscle, even though I was frozen in fear and far too drugged to even attempt putting up a fight. They consciously decided it would take all five of them to handle an underweight, overdosing, sobbing teenage girl. They dragged me upright, loudly paraded me handcuffed through my apartment building, all while cracking jokes about how I was getting blood everywhere. They threw me into the back of their cruiser, and then dragged me into the hospital without a stretcher or wheelchair. Later, after my stomach was pumped, one of the cops came into the hospital room and told me that if I tried to leave, I would be arrested, and that they\u2019d found my suicide note. It was a journal entry where I\u2019d written \u201cI want to die\u201d under a detailed account of my sexual assault. They absolutely get enjoyment out of making peoples\u2019 worst moments even more traumatic.",

Instead of sending a squad car with one or two cops, they sent SWAT. My parents happened to be over at the time, talking to a neighbor who lived directly across from the depressed guy, when SWAT showed up in full force. Oddly, the SWAT team didn't even have full tactical gear. They were wearing shorts and T-shirts mostly, but they had helmets and weapons. The depressed neighbor was standing in his front doorway with his hands up. Nobody even tried to talk to him. They just aimed and screamed. Because of the way they enclosed him, nobody watching this event unfold saw what happened next, but they just unloaded on him. My parents and neighbor saw the whole thing happen. Was it suicide by cop? Did he make a sudden move that resulted in his death? Couldn't they have just tased him? Did they just mag-dump him just so they could get home and watch TV? Who knows, but a powerful sense of grief hung over the neighborhood for a long time afterward. I still remember his family, who flew in from the Northwest, coming to collect his things before the house was abandoned for a couple of years. I can't even look at that house without wondering just what the hell happened. I wish someone would buy it and knock it down.",

People \"caring\" and involving themselves in others lives in none meaningful ways not their job: simply have a too good life. They lack meaningful purpose and/or need to drive one. \n\nThis is not a new theory. Across some European nations in the late 1800's it was well accepted that people need to be provided with something they can control for some of their time in order for you to push and squeeze them as a society (tax). This for the greater good: healthcare, infrastructure etc . Everybody suffers somewhat to have the most widely spread standard of living that can well be fulfilling. This is where a.o. community gardens find their origin. Give a man a plot of land to do with as he pleases and you can have them slaving away five/six days a week for pennies. That was a more fulfilling life than that of the average Karen. Would make for an interesting contemporary study. Obviously there is a lot to unpack here, more than is easy to do in a comment but you get the gist.\n\nTldr: late 2000's professor: Karen's have a life without purpose. This makes them miserable. They fill it by involving themselves in others lives, wanted or not.\n\nEdit: spelling",

            "comment": "She is just so bitter.\n\nThey remind her of herself when she was younger. She was the popular girl in school. She dreamt of marrying the love of her life and having the most beautiful wedding. But it eventually it became apparent that all the boys were just interested in her body. After graduating, nobody was interested in her anymore because her body was used up already.\n\nThe love of her life ended up marrying stace, the girl she used to bully. They had the exact wedding she had dreamed of. Years later she ended up marrying frank when they are both in their late 40's. Frank is the guy who used to rail her behind the dumpster after football practice, but when asked she claims he was her high school sweetheart.\n\nBoth her and frank have their own children already (frank actually has 2 from his 2 previous marriages) and the kids hate eachother. Both sides refuse to admit their kid is in the wrong, so the kids fighting becomes the parents fighting.\n\nHer sex life is non existant, again, her body was used up long ago. Most evenings are spent in bed reading their individual books. Eventually Frank tries going to sleep but she wants to keep reading and Frank can't sleep with the light on. They'll fight about this as soon as the kids are at school.\n\nThe only joy she gets is walking the dog during the weekend. It's the only time she's out of the house, but she doesn't make the connection.\n\nThis week's walk she spots something weird, people standing at the pond she allways walks past. They are wearing wedding clothes and laughing while somebody takes pictures.\n\nShe thinks back to her childhood dream of marriage. She realises her life has gone down the drain and she won't ever be as happy as she hoped to be.\n\nBut if she can't be happy, maybe she can just make others miserable.\n\nShe yanks on her dog's leash, and goes in for the attack.\n\n\"Excuse me miss, you can't...!\"",

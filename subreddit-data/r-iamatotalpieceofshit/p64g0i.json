This is why minorities, the poor and the mentally ill have been telling everyone for decades that this is what the police do on a regular basis and no one listened. What this poster described isn't a rare occurrence, not even in Canada where I live. The only reason some people are changing their opinion is because we have so much video evidence now, and even still there's very many people who say \"it's only a few bad apples, there's no problem with our police forces\". Which is ironic because the entire phrase is \"a few bad apples spoil the whole bunch\", meaning that as long as there's even a few bad officers, the entire force is rotted through. We had a full video of an officer kneeling on a man's neck for over 9 minutes until he died broadcasted on every single news station and social media site for weeks, and a massive portion of the population still defend the officer. The only reason we even had that video is because a young black girl risked her own life to take it because she knew that without it, filling a report and contacting the media would have gone nowhere, even with multiple corroborating eye witness accounts. \n\n So no, I highly doubt publicising the event will have any impact, especially since the mentally ill elderly woman doesn't have the capacity to advocate for herself. Which I'm sure the officer involved, his partner that watched it happen and did nothing, and the department that were made aware of the incident from a very reliable source but still ignored it, are all very aware of.",

LivePD is the modern equivalent but they try to show cops in a sympathetic light, COPS was basically a compilation reel of excessive police violence.\n\nA few months ago I looked it up on YT to see if it was as bad as I remembered, skipped to a random part, and an officer sicked a dog on an unarmed guy laying in his fucking bed. You could argue that racial bias wasn't very evident in that show because they'd indiscriminately beat the shit out of anyone who looked poor but either way, everyone knew cops were total thugs, there just wasn't a cultural giving of shits about it.",

That it is a felony, that if they lie on the stand or on official reports they commit felonies.

Not only have you gotten them to cross that line, breaking the law, you have them doing something worse than what you did.  You can \"come clean,\" and get a slap on the wrist and get them in big trouble.  Now you have leverage.\n\nOr they refuse to lie and everyone knows that cop is a narc, don't trust them, don't socialize with them, and make them miserable until they quit.\n\nOnce they agree to break laws you start showing them the ropes, what they can get away with, what crimes the culture encourages.

They should have greater control over their emotions. Instead it is too often the opposite. We see a lot of alpha-types with serious authority complexes abusing citizens and getting away with it.\n\nThe untrained citizens are the ones expected to maintain a superhuman mastery of their emotions in a state of crisis when a cop is present to avoid an escalation of events.",

Bananas work the same way and are shipped green and then exposed to ethylene to ripen them for sale. Anyway, the point is you must remove the bad apples aggressively or they will make the rest of the apples go bad, too, which is exactly what's happened to our police.

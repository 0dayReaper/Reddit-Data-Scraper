Let's assume that the electricity costs 5 cents per kWh. \n\nCharger's power intake is somewhere around 2 to 10 watts depending on the charger, so let's assume that the charger drags five watts. \n\nSo we divide kWh by 1000 to get Wh (Watt hours). We get 0.005 cents. Then we multiply that with the power draw of the charger. \n\nSo in total, running a five watt charger for an hour at five cents per kWh costs 0.025 cents. \n\nNOTE: These are CENTS. Not Dollars, not Euros. CENTS. The cost for an hour is a fraction of a cent.",

This was in 2015 and one specific employee had a Nissan Leaf.  Every day this guy would get in super early and always get a spot that was next to an outlet, so he'd leave his car charging while at work.(Rumor was he never charged at home because of this)  Not an EV specific spot, just would tap the work outlet to charge.  It doesn't sound that bad, but some people asked the question, why is this allowed?  Is the company going to provide gas cards to the rest of the employees, or a travel allowance?  Unless the company is providing specific EV spots/chargers this guy is clearly gaming the system....",

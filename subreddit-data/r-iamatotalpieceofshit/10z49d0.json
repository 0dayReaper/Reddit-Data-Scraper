I used to work at one of the major healthcare companies (it has a big blue logo lol) and it was VERY normal for people to call in asking for help finding a new doctor\u2026\u201dAn American one\u201d, \u201cOne who speaks English,\u201d \u201cOne who isn\u2019t from India,\u201d etc etc. They never specifically said they wanted a white doctor, but it was very heavily implied. Last name Rodriguez, Jackson, or Patel? Forget it. I would select a name and they would reject the doctor by the name alone because it didn\u2019t sound white enough. A lot of times, they were looking for specialists for whatever condition they were suffering from. It always made me feel gross to be part of that conversation. \n\nAs a side note, I have a very clear sounding voice and some of those same callers would say things like, \u201cThank god you\u2019re American,\u201d or say something mildly racist about well I speak. (I think you catch my drift.) Little did they know, I\u2019m a black child of immigrants and these conversations always made me extremely uncomfortable.",

The man glared at me because the owner's parents are from India and as such his name reflects that heritage. I just shrugged and told him the owner is from New Jersey, because he is.",

That's very logical and enlightening. Thanks.\n\nI had previously assumed that the names were supplanted onto them as a form of ownership and of brainwashing them into further submission. I never put more thought into how rather than taking the opportunity to correct this after being released, they kept those names. It was more important to be reunited with their lost loved ones through easy identification.",

This area has been a stronghold for a certain political leaning since well before I was alive and still is now. No matter how much that will irk some people, it's contributed.  My town itself could actually be called diverse at this point.   But it could be generations until those old attitudes die out.",

Also large Black and Chinese communities. Aside from being the most boring fucking place in the world, it\u2019s considered a nice place to live. \n\nWithin Mississauga and Brampton there is the \u2018old\u2019 community. These are all white and generally very wealthy people who live in the parts of town that existed when Mississauga and Brampton were their own communities (ie before they got swallowed up in Toronto\u2019s suburbs). These places have been a hotbed of racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to really call it a conflict because the \u2018new\u2019 Mississauga outnumber these people by a huge amount. They\u2019re more like a nuisance.",

When I mentioned that to the corpsman he did the double-take face and just got up and walked away. The head medical *officer* at this point comes over and very friendly says \"We're gonna take a ride into town. Follow me.\"\n\nThe Thai hospital we went to was probably the cleanest hospital I've ever seen from the inside, the staff was exceptionally polite, and the doctor I met with took the time to explain in detail what she thought it could be given the existing antibiotics.\n\nEasily the smoothest medical interaction in my life, and sadly that was only the first of many to come later on in the States.",

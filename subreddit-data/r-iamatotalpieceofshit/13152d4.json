He uses the video to put the blame on her and to make himself look like the victim. He blames her for being the wrong person. He complains about being the victim of a liberal society, in Texas of all places, that allows his wife to abandon their marriage and take his kids away from him. He also claims to be a victim of blackmail by Candace Owens over her threatening to release details of the divorce. He then turns to the ol' reliable of the abuser's tool kit of threats and intimidation when he warns of legal action against people talking about his divorce in a way that he doesn't like.\n\nWhat he thought he was doing was getting ahead of the story and controlling the narrative. What he actually did was prove everything that's coming out about him is true.",

Never answer an emotional argument. Stonewall, stick to facts. Things you KNOW beyond a shadow of a doubt. You will want to defend yourself, your feelings, or try to bring them to your side. That\u2019s the trap. They lure you to an emotional space and then blow you up. So don\u2019t go there at all. Easier said than done.

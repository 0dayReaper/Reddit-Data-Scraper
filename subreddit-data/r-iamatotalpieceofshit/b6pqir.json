If it's the word of a criminal vs the word of a cop, a judge will almost always believe the cop. Like this dude in the video probably didn't even bother filing a complaint because absolutely nothing would have happened. He knows it's not worth fighting back or even saying anything because he'd be the one to get in trouble.\n\nWith the power and trust we place in cops, they need to have much harsher punishments if they're found to break that trust.

The legal system really needs to hold them more accountable, much more accountable.",

I mean once someone achieves a certain level of power in our culture, we kinda just accept the fact that they can get away with doing anything. They might be punished but they won't go to jail. I mean if it came out that Trump had rigged the 2016 election and defrauded the nation, he wouldn't go to prison for that. He *might* not even be fucking impeached for it. You'd have some people praising him for his ingenuity. But the moment some underling is connected to the crime, he'd be brought to trial and sentenced to death for being a traitor. \n\nThe sad thing is, that bar for \"a certain level of power\" is incredibly low if your every day cop can wrongly beat someone to death and get transferred to another city for it.

The ideal point of a police system is to protect citizens, ideally non-violently so no-one gets hurt. But there are so many cases of misconduct, cover ups, and brutality; there's so little transparency too. The police system encourages the bad apples because it encourages brutality, not non-violent resolution. Which is all very idealistic, there will always be dangerous people and violence is sometimes necessary. But it shouldn't be the first or even third thing a cop is trained to do, since most of the time when the police are called it isn't to take down some Heisenberg style villain. Most of the time it's normal people in common but painful situations who need help. In the bad apple metaphor, the tree itself is rotting, and the rot needs to be pulled out. ",

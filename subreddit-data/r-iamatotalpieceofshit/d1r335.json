She doesn\u2019t mind small dogs but gets aggressive around big dogs out of fear and she is just a cute 25 pound springerpoodle. I think it originated because we visited with another family\u2019s dog that had a bad temperament when she was a puppy and now acts like that. Plus she has been attacked by a german Shepard before for no reason. She was just reaching across the fence saying hi and the Shepard grabbed her by her ear and tore it in half. It was the worst day ever, the sound that came from my poor dog was blood curling.",

Off leash dog attacked him as a puppy and now he gets aggressively defensive when he sees another dog. \n\nI\u2019ve worked with him to the point where he can be in the groomers and mostly ignore other dogs unless they bark or growl at him first but it\u2019s taken 5 years to get that far and I think that\u2019s about as good as he\u2019s gonna get. It takes a couple days of semi constant contact to get him used to and trusting of a new dog in his area.\n\nI feel bad because I can\u2019t do any agility or sport work with him because of it. :( Off leash dog owners infuriate me.\n\n\u201cMy dog is friendly and I can control it just fine\u201d.

I didn't have any real animosity towards the dog and owner(except leash your fucking dog in areas where leashes are required unless they have perfect recall. This dog did not,the owner called him three times before he stopped a foot away from us).",

My dog is 63 pounds and this dog barely came up to his knees.  The little guy kept barking and growling at my boy.  My dog is very well behaved, and plays great with other dogs, but when one is on leash and one is off the dynamic can be very different.  And with another dog barking/growling around me my boy can get protective.  Thankfully the other owner finally came over and grabbed is dog, laughing about how cute it was the entire time.  No, your dog barking/growling at my dog is not cute.  It wouldn't be cute if my big dog was barking/growling at the little dog, and it isn't cute when the little one is doing it either.",

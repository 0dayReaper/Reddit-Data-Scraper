There\u2019s actually just a minority of the most deadliest mass killer or serials that didn\u2019t began on animal. \n\nSo, that said, it\u2019s, as human responsibility to find them. I suggest to anyone to spread the message to Facebook communities and other internet teams you could find, there\u2019s some with profiles and knowledge to find this kind of guys. Hackers black or white hat, whatever, they usually don\u2019t like that much this kind of behaviour and can help a lot) communities, web profilers, some simple guys on their own corner trying improve world. \n\nThis kind of comportment is for me a real initiatic rite to cruelty and sadism. I hope I\u2019m wrong but wouldn\u2019t be that surprised to see in few months/years a news about it\u2026 \n\nIf someone can find him and warn the proper country police about it..",

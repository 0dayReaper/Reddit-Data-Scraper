I got downstairs and ask what she wants for breakfast.  She says, \u201cYou went back to sleep so I made my own breakfast!\u201d\n\nMy heart sank. Did she destroy the kitchen?  Was she actually cooking?  What the ffff?  I look in the kitchen and it\u2019s fine. I go into the family room as I\u2019m asking, \u201cwhat did you have for breakfast?!\u201d\n\nShe proudly leans out of the way to show me an enormous pile of candy wrappers and the giant now-half-empty tub of Halloween candy. \n\nAbout an hour later, my wife came home from the night shift and asked \u201cwhy is she acting like she\u2019s on crack?\u201d  My daughter proudly showed mommy how she made her own breakfast before she continued running around the couch a hundred times chanting \u201cand I run.... and I run... and I run...\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lovely video of this that we bust out every now and then just to crack up.",

You could feel the sugar crystals crush between your teeth when you fist put it in your mouth.  Bazooka was much harder, and often had a whitish powder (maybe cornstarch or something to help keep it from sticking to the wrapper.  The comics and stuff you could order by collecting and returning the comics was a real incentive to me to chew more.

It does make sense to target the things that kill young people more than old people - but of course the tweet is comparing a single day of Covid deaths, so the \"rebuttal\" would be fair if that was the total number of deaths, but your figures show how poor a rebuttal it really is.",

It's crucial to understand these numbers because then we can proactively use these savings to protect vulnerable populations in the future so these people did not die in vain.\n\nUnfortunately too many equate the mere suggestion that we look at it from this perspective as criminal.

A 40 year old may have young children who would be left without their parent. A 25 year old has his/her life ahead of them. Conversely, an 80 year old has lived their life, and has only adult children. \n\nWhat this guy is missing/underestimating is that this shit has gone on for more than a year, and still isn't over. The combined loss of life makes 9/11 look like a pebble hitting a brick wall. Lots of relatively young people have died or suffered long covid too. I just don't think 9/11 is a reasonable comparison to a pandemic.",

Covid took the only opportunity I had to get my part of my parents remains. I have my fathers ashes and I wanted just a tiny bit of theirs to have with him but no, covid made me stay several states away and it\u2019s not illegal to keep a sibling from receiving ashes.

Neither of us are talking in solid numbers though but I don't think the numbers are so low you can say they're \"radically overestimating\".",

My shul has survivors who attend on Shabbat and holidays and I have no reason to doubt they attend events, especially for seniors.\n\nAs for most camp survivors currently living in Europe, what\u2019s the source for that? I would guess the US or Israel had and have the largest numbers, followed possibly by the UK.",

To be clear, if one points a blank firing gun next to their head and pulls the trigger it will blow a piece of their skull into their brain and very much result in external bleeding.  Hexum is who I was thinking of and the blank very much opened his head.\n\nLee's death was significantly more complicated and Ii believe at a range a blank alone would not be reasonably life threatening and even a squib as purported raises an eyebrow.",

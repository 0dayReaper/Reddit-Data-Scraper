A person was tying bags of dog poop way up in trees, they would bend over saplings and tie bags to the top so they were out of reach.   \n\nThe environmental police had a building on the property and I asked them about it.  The cop was pissed becasue he had gone around the previous weekend and removed them all only to have more appear.   \n\nwe only have about 6 environmental cops in my area but they all staked out  the property until they found the crazy ass lady who was doing it.   apparently she didnt like dog walkers so this was her answer.   I was told they gave her every  possible fine they  could",

Crews go invading homes looking to steal only guns and they go car hopping targeting any vehicles that look like they belong to hunters, cops, that have nra stickes etc. looking almost exclusively for guns. I remember a bar tender there being killed by Manzano high when a group of teens broke in his home looking for guns. He was one of several houses in the area they just walked in that were occupied the night he was murdered. I think there was like 4 boys that did it and then another teenager was killed in the same area on the same night in a drive by at a party. The state representative Stephanie Maez\u2019s son was one of the accused at first and spent several months in jail until the 3 kids in the drive by were identified and arrested. She had to actually resign to help her son in his defense and due to the media attention and her kid wasn\u2019t even actually involved. He just happened to be acquainted with the boys from school or something like that.",

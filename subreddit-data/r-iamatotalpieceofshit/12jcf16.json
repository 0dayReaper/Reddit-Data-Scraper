But only a closet homosexual can keep up a focused message that being gay is a choice, and keep coming back to that particular sin day after day. There's just no more sure way to prove you aren't gay that to double down on how much you hate even the thought of it day after day after day. And no one (over generalization again) feels the need to prove they aren't something that they actually aren't.",

Which is what the preachers/cult leaders really want.\nThey get up there with fire and brimstone with a version of following Christ's teachings that paints the world as filled with sin and evil and most of all--fear. The followers march out there with that hateful rhetoric and antagonize people into repenting but low-and-behold people often meet that energy by arguing or worse. It serves to confirm that the *world* not the rhetoric is a hateful place to these cultists and deepens allegiance to the BS.\n\nThis lady responded the only way that actually \"works\" she responded by not getting upset or even arguing with any of his trash behavior. She stayed calm, civil and he literally growls in frustration. Then this absolutely spineless cretin comes back at night to destroy art made to love and welcome people.\n\nHopefully they get even more folks to help repaint it again.",

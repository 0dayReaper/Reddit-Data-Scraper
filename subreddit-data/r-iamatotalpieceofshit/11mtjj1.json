I left my post unedited for honesty, the salient points are still relevant \n\nOkay, you keep saying this. Can I get a citation or a link about this please? I did a little digging, and maybe I still have to dial in my search terms but it still looks like most of these lawsuits are settled by the city, but some cities are making police and individual officers carry liability insurance to discourage misconduct.\n\nHowever if you're correct then *semantically* the city didn't pay out 8 mil, the cities insurance did. Out of curiosity - and I don't know - do insurance rates go up after lawsuits like this? Would that increase in insurance rates still not cost taxpayer money?\n\n\n\nEven if it is the case, my point wasn't actually about taxpayer money. My point is that this system (be it city or insurance accountability) still leads to a lack of accountability amongst the police force. If an officer fucked up, or is outright abusive (this example is very tame by comparison) there is often no repercussion or even incentive to do much about it.\n\nPolice would begin policing each other, and departments would start focusing on proper engagement and legal education if the pressure has an effect on the police.  \n\nI could word this better but I doubt you'll read it anyway. I feel like I've generally made my point about why the police union should be liable for payout and not the city (or their insurance)",

Does winning a court case and getting paid a settlement equal true justice? No, it does not. Should this disgrace of a human have been fired and banned from working for a police department (or similar types of employment) again? Absolutely. \n\nThe unfortunate fact is that this type of treatment occurs regularly in the US and the majority of these people get no acknowledgment that they were wronged, no settlement, and are left with nothing but trauma and legal bills. Those who are injured in these interactions are also saddled with medical bills on top of everything else. So this family\u2019s outcome is happier relative to most outcomes, although I agree it should have never happened in the first place and the officer, as well as his department, should have suffered harsh consequences for this encounter. Hopefully if more of these cases end in large financial payouts, thus causing financial strain and detriment to the counties/states, there will be more motivation to prevent it from happening in the first place. It would be ideal if state and local governments wanted to prevent it based solely on humanitarian reasons, but realistically (and sadly), the financial reasons will motivate them more.",

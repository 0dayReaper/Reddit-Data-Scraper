                                    "comment": "Hi. Human here. I've been shot that many times. Of the seven rounds fired in me, 1 was lodged in my breastplate and was removed without tools (literally by hand). Two more were grazing. One went through my forearm, another hit my shin and calf, ejecting most of the fragments. One didn't have any power left and only caused a burn (jacket absorbed and little momentum it had), and the last nearly killed me because it was lodged in my lower intestine and perforated in multiple places. Despite the massive blood loss, and length of time to get to ER, obviously I survived. The other wounds were not fatal - I would have died from infection but not the loss of blood. \n\n\nVery few people die immediately from a gun shot. Guns kill slowly through blood loss and there's only a few places where getting hit means death is fast. Handguns aren't accurate enough to deliberately and reliably hit them except at point blank. They're \"spray and pray\" weapons. What will kill you is delay in first aid. Once you get to a hospital, if you're still conscious your odds of survival are very high. Even if they can't triage you at the scene, they can start fluids to keep your blood pressure from crashing... Sure you'll be pumping more saline than blood but you'll be alive.\n\n\nI will say this: getting shot hurts, but not as much as you'd expect. And you'll be able to keep fighting for some time after. But it's crucial someone (if not you) call emergency services and get medical rolling. And don't count on a crowd of people. Those fuckers are more interested in youtubing your slow death. They won't call unless you single one of them out and start screaming in their face to call 911. Make them feel *personally* responsible for it. When you need help in public don't scream for help, point to individuals, call them out by description - \"you in the red shirt and jeans, call 911!\"\n\n\nAfter the immediate threat is dealt with you need to assume control and give orders to ensure your survival. The average person is very stupid and not engaged. They will have no sense of urgency. They're in a haze of stupid. Snap them hard, and get people on task. You, the victim, has to do this or you're dead. \n\n\nThat's how most people die - not from the attack but a lack of action immediately after. You are still in the emergency until qualified professionals arrive. Never forget that if you ever find yourself there. The gun probably won't kill you. The bystanders doing nothing... They will.\n\n\nOh... And yes EMTs can help your dog too. Don't laugh if they pull up wikihow to know where to strap and poke needles. They have the skills to keep doggo going too, until they get to a vet. Doggo first aid is much the same as human... Keep vitals going and get to a vet. They'll take care of him too. Just keep pressure on the wound and the airway clear. You may have to take direction from them if there are humans who need triage first. Just stay calm and follow directions given.",

Giving him so much attention and love. Playing with him. He gets spoilt rotten by me. As expected, he's basically stuck to my side all day. \n\nA few days ago his dog was sleeping behind my desk which faces my bedroom door and my brother came home unexpectedly. My brother came storming into my room and my brothers dog went ape shit at him until he realizes who it was. It's so nice knowing that his dog would protect me, especially because I have PTSD from being sexually assaulted in my home. For the first time in 10 years, I feel safe being home alone. \n\n[Dog tax](http://imgur.com/a/bz43jw9)",

It\u2019s not like woof woof I bark at people and squirrels, it\u2019s like their entire being is focused on putting themselves in between danger and their human. She was always watching, like an invisible string tied to her people. Soooo different than the other breeds I\u2019d experienced before! (Caveat here is that she was from a breeder who specialized in working line dogs and was considered \u201chigh drive\u201d even by their standards, so I don\u2019t think they\u2019re all that intense.

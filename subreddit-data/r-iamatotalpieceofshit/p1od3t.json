I had to do 100 hours of community service and pay close to that when I tried to contest my first speeding ticket as a teen (75 on the highway too, not even like I was going that fast somewhere residential).\n\nOnly difference between that and this guy's *third DUI* is the license suspension.",

You give out sentences that imply the focus is on rehabilitation, but the remorsefulness of the perpetrator seems to be completely disregarded in cases such as this, and also your penitentiary system seems extremely similar to the one that we have in the US (which does *not* foster rehabilitation). \n\n\n\nI believe in rehabilitation, but 100% not in the case of somebody who flips off people after getting off largely scott-free. That complete lack of remorse shows that this person is a great threat to society and other people. The rights to rehabilitate criminals end where the rights of the general populace begin. The greater the risk you appear to be to general society, the longer you should spend in jail.",

If you're applying a data-based approach, it makes sense to release certain kinds of murderers in, say, 15-20 years, as opposed to giving them life sentences. But of course, that's a decision you make in conjunction with board recommendations, behavioral records, and psychological assessment, not something done in a blanket way. \n\nOne study I read 5-10 years ago that followed convicted murderers found that they had around a 1% five-year recidivism rate, for any kind of crime other than parole violation (sample size was around 1500. iirc). Compare that to a ~80% recidivism rate for property crime offenders or ~70-ish% for violent criminals as a whole.",

I met a lot of people who were truly remorseful and I was able to tell they wouldnt make that absolutely shit decision again. \n\nHate to say it but the majority of people were blaming everything and everyone but themselves. We had a therapist doing group therapy with us one day and I did bring up the financial burden of the situation and a few people agreed with a guy saying it was chump change. I just kept thinking they should've faced jail time instead then because if they're not suffering from the consequences of their actions they wouldn't learn and end up doing it again. \n\nI still speak openly about it to everyone because I've seen so many people leave the bar after drinking and, well I couldve done something worse than getting pulled over the night it happened to me.",

It doesn\u2019t always turn out like this as the laws in the US are just as wonky as the laws in the UK. I hope the families can go after him in a civil suit.",

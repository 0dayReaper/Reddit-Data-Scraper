It was probably me that went and bought the pregnancy tests but even if I didn\u2019t I knew my wife was taking on. She never just walked up and showed me one. I\u2019ve seen all my kid\u2019s sonograms and was probably there when it was taken. The sonograms (I can see an old one hanging on our fridge right now) have her name and the date on them. If someone hands a guy a cropped sonogram after several weeks of gestation and he doesn\u2019t ask any questions about the timeliness of their reveal I think he has bigger problems. He doesn\u2019t deserve to be manipulated but it probably isn\u2019t his first or last rodeo.",

I did have an issue with the fact that he came into contact with Foles about 6 times while performing the celebration. Also had an issue with the fact that our o line, who's job it is to protect Foles, didn't do a damn thing. Taunting has had it's fair share of controversy the last few years in a league. If you look towards the opposing sideline or even a player from the other team and flex your muscles, you'll get a flag. But this didn't get a penalty. Kind of crazy really.",

That's just pathetic and they never gave him a chance to really get anything going or establish a rhythm which Matt Ryan is that type of quarterback to shred defenses if he doesn't have to run for his life after the ball hits his hands",

The reporting for TBI ( traumatic brain injury) indicates that it is on par with football and hockey, accounting for 22% of soccer injuries.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of POS parents that let their kids play soccer!",

Both players receive a disqualification from the current and next drive they would play (ie: DB can't continue play this drive and the next time his team is on defense).",

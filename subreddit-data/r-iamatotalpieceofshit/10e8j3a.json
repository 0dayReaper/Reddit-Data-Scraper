I hate what's happening in this video but the comments here are absolutely evil. they literally farm and eat dogs in Korea and western folks look the other way. Japan's treatment toward animals is especially bad as well. they hunt whale and dolphin for fucks sake. we are conditioned by years of propaganda to believe China and it's people are awful. I've been here for ten years and I can say I've never seen anything like this. I understand that it happens but I don't know a single person in China that eats dog or cat or any other exotic meats. one of the reasons I stay in China is because I know what kind of racism and stereotypes my wife and half Chinese son are going to face. Reddit is just a  sample.",

The building was new to our business but not a brand new building. The plumber that came in to fix everything was pulling used tampons and PADS!!! out of the pipes.  Even though that waste was more than likely from the people before us, all of us women had to get a crash course on what not to flush down the toilets. I have MAD respect for what you do!",

Tile and shit like that, it was backbreaking for him, hell on the knees.  One day, I got a call from him saying he was going to be late.  He had to work in some welfare housing in the area doing install.  Poor guy came home with his clothes in a bag because  of all the bedbugs. Right into the trash. They all had to hose off outside.   It just kept happening.  Inevitably, we had our own breakout in our house.  Nightmare.\n\nThen the restaurants in the area.  You would never want to eat at any of the places he'd tell stories about.  There was a local Chinese buffet that closed for health violations. We had been warned off the place, but he'd tell stories about the remodel and the food that wouldn't get cleaned up off the floor, ancient chicken bones in the grout. Bugs.\n\nEdit just recalled:  the Absolute Worst was after he became a letter carrier.  He was delivering in an apartment building, and delivered a package to the door of one residence.  Unclothed toddler maybe 3 or 4?year old answered the door, covered in food and poop, house smelled like shit, was just this kid and a younger one alone.  He had to wait for over 2 hours for the the cops to come to make sure the kids were safe so he could leave. No one was charged with anything.  He had to keep delivering to this place like nothing happened.  Broke his heart.\n\nUpdate:  Hubby corrected me, it was closer to four hours.",

So the paramedic goes to unwrap this bandage and he gets it off and this necrotic rotten flesh from this guys arm just falls off onto the floor and the Paramedics boots. I\u2019m getting gagged just writing this remembering it. You could see bone and tendon. Oh that fucking smell was sickening. The guy died like two hours later at the hospital he was so sceptic. Even the doctors at the ER were amazed at how this guy was even alive. But seeing rotten human flesh fall off of a living mans arm was the level ten on fucked up shit I had to witness in my life. I\u2019ve also witnessed a human being hit by a semi truck aftermath. Head over here, guys over here, legs over here. Living in filth ? Probably the home covered in dog shit and carpet infested with fleas and bedbugs, rotting food in the refrigerator. Those places were just falling apart and it sucked if we had to go in to get the patient cause they couldn\u2019t come outside.

He straight up said I don't get paid enough to go in there. I looked through the door, and roaches were falling from the ceiling. There were maggots on piles of rotten food all over the house. The children were sitting on the couch eating something rotten and roaches crawled on them. The children weren't even bothered by the roaches on them they acted like they weren't even there. \n\nAfter bossman was done he went straight home and stripped in the front yard while his wife sprayed him with garden hose.  That's the worst one I've seen but there's many like it I've been too. Having roaches fall into your hair is an unsettling experience. Another one is when you hand the person the bill and a roach crawls from their arm across the bill onto your hand. Took just about all the composure I had not to flip my shit.",

It wasn't hard to sweep the rice into a napkin or to make sure she stayed contained and then we cleaned what we could on the table and left $20 on an $80 bill to make up for the mess. The table behind us with 3 kids and a big mess only left $2 tip.\n\n Don't give your kid rice if you're not willing to clean the mess, I can guarantee that kid wouldn't be allowed to do that at home.",

Ideally if you've had a child with you that's thrown food all over the joint the simple act of just stacking up your plates near the edge of the table when you leave alleviates the frustration of cleaning it. Half of the shittiness is having to pick through other people's half chewed food and sloppiness just to get to the plates and get them out of the way before clearing the trash and then wiping down the surface.\n\n\n\nThat little act making the clean up just a tiny bit easier saves a lot of time for the server clearing tables and is really no stress on the customers themselves. Is not just about showing the staff respect, it's about not going into a business and acting like you own the place because you spent maybe $80 on a small family dinner.\n\n\n\nKeep in mind waitstaff generally work gloveless for the sake of grip on plates and speed on service.",

Not on the server or restaurant, but when dealing with people who have kids that they just let act a fool. Alot of them feel that it's the restaurants job to deal with this, but leaving an exceptional mess like this for \"someone else to pick up\" is pretty trashy. Your kid made the mess, teach your kid responsibility and respect by not doing this and showing them that taking the responsibility to clean up after yourself, isn't so fun when you have to do it. I was raised to treat the CEO of of a company, with the same respect as the janitor. Nobody should act as though anyone else is beneath them. People are all humans who deserve proper respect. You wouldn't walk in your bosses office and just start using their things or leaving a mess in there, just like you don't just walk through the janitors freshly mopped floors. Respecting other people's hard work and property is a huge sign of a person good character. This attitude of \"equality\" led me into a very quick progression throughout my time in the Army. By treating people in a hierarchy, with the same respect, and only using position to accomplish work together, I was able to lead soldiers that not only would listen and follow me, but respect me as leader.",

Kids around age 1-2 are all in a phase where half their food ends up on the floor every meal. You don\u2019t have a broom and dust pan so you can\u2019t really clean up the floor. A lot of times the kids are way beyond their attention span at that point so hanging out to clean up is worse as they can\u2019t sit still and they start to scream/cry. Best thing you can really do as a parent is leave a generous tip and bounce.",

If I am responsible for digging loose fries or penne from under the booth with a napkin, as some reddit users are suggesting I am, then I'm just not interested. Besides, the time it takes me to clean while parenting is 5x what it would be childless with a towel and broom. Doing it myself slows the pace they can turn a table.\n\nTiming matters too. We avoid all busy times and never wait. It makes things easier and the kids eat early anyhow. If we skipped it and grabbed takeout, that is ~$25 in tips that are just gone since the table will remain idle. I would imagine most waitstaff would prefer we are there vs. not. In pre-plague times we had a few favorite spots with regular servers. While I realize staff has to be nice, I feel like I have super good relationships with a few. Always seemed happy to see us and the kids, well beyond what would be expected. If we are out of line, these guys are good at faking it!",

I rolled my eyes and prepared myself for the terrible mess that the woman and her kids would leave. Went back into the kitchen to clean some dishes and help the cooks. \n\n15 minutes later it comes time to bus the tables and the woman had cleaned and stacked everything as best she could. Meanwhile, those men in snappy suits had left the worst mess that they possibly could have. Drink spilled, food all over the place (and ground into the carpet), and like 20 napkins crumpled and littering the table, chairs, and floor. \n\nI'm guessing that woman has worked retail or restaurants before, and knows it's shitty to leave a complete mess for someone. Fuck those guys, though. \n\nEver since that job, I always tidy up everything and stack plates. I'll get on the floor and clean up any food my own young children have managed to grind into the carpet. It's just rude to leave a catastrophe for someone to deal with.",

I am not sure what people expect, but going to the back, borrowing cleaning equipment while 4 kids quietly stand there without further messing and bothering people doesn\u2019t sound realistic.  This restaurant provides high chairs and kids meals, which isn\u2019t an invitation to create a huge mess, but is an invitation to have children in the establishment.  I can assure you the meal was more tiring an frustrating for the parents than just making spaghetti at home, but you need to take your kids out from time to time to give them experiences and help keep them learning.",

Then there's always a fucking mess. I hate especially on the corner booth because that thing is impossible to clean. And all the kids break their crayons up into small pieces and scatter them everywhere. Thank God we are currently out of crayons.",

One person has an idea, someone else eggs them on, people add more and more energy until the situation is riled up beyond control. Everyone is either desperate to fit in or scared of what will happen if they go against the group, so nobody speaks up to stop it. Or they think some combination of \"it must be okay if everyone's doing it\" or \"this group is big enough that I won't get caught.\"\n\nIt's not a new phenomenon. Riots and lynch mobs have existed since forever. Or to a lesser extent, any trend or fad. Today's landscape might be a bit different only because of social media, where you don't have to physically be near somebody to feed off their energy. It's how things like the Ice Bucket Challenge and Devious Licks start and spread.",

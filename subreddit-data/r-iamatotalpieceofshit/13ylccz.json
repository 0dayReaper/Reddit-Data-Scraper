Most of those patients were severely mentally ill - with schizophrenia and this deinstitutionalization has only continued over the decades while mental health numbers increase. Most places that are 'all over the place' can't hold people for more than 72 hours.\n\nYou're being downvoted because he *did* utterly gut mental health programs, Medicaid and Department of Health budgets and deinstitutionalization was only the beginning of the massive amount of damage his policies caused across marginalized groups.\n\nReagan was trash...so 'just mentioning Reagan' like the other guy said is surely going to be met with legitimate negativity.

A random extradition for a crime committed in its own territory doesn\u2019t instill that kind of confidence. \n\nBut that\u2019s neither here nor there. Nominally, HK is still a separate system with its own security apparatus and I think it\u2019s most likely that this case will stay in that system.",

The example that person gave was that if a pedophile molests or rapes a child, if they know they will get the death penalty for doing it then they're more likely to also murder the child. \n\nApply that thinking to this situation, if this man that murdered two women knew he would get the death penalty, he might decide to murder more people. Why not, if he's already going to die for it?\n\nAnother thing to consider when people call for murderers to get the death penalty is that, in the US at least, a lot of the women that are in prison are there because they either defended themselves from abuse by killing their abuser or they feared for their lives and killed an abuser that had already abused them but wasn't actively abusing them when they killed the abuser. I've read a study before that stated the defense \"I feared for my life\" for murder tends to work less in court for women than it does for men. I personally wouldn't say that they deserve the death penalty for defending themselves.",

To stop a madman with a knife and not get people killed in the process you'd need a solid 5-10 able and strong people I'd guess.\n\nNot to mention you'd need said amount of people willing to take such a risk. I.e. you probably need 50+ people around for that to even start coming close to odds of something organizing.\n\nPresumably most all would be strangers and have to self-organize in very little time. I'd imagine an attack like this is beyond hope within what, 30 seconds?\n\nThis is all pure conjecture. Maybe someone else has a clearer idea of the logistics at play here.",

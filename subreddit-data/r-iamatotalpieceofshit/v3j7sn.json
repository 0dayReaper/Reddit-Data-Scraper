In most jurisdictions, an undesired touch of something that is attached to someone else, or that someone else is holding, is the same as an undesired touch of the person, themselves.  Put another way, purse snatchers are not only guilty of theft, but of battery as well.\n\nIt\u2019s also a tort (a civil wrong) for which the man in white could sue the cast member.  While the damages for the battery would be de minimus ($1 maybe), a jury may award more due to their outrage over the context.",

From what I read a while back, you're not allowed to run, as that would imply that something is not well in the Kingdom, and that is not part of the show.  (I assume this would exclude times when it would be required to avoid harm.)  Got curious about it all a while back when we went, and noticed signs all over the place that said \"Cast Members Only\".  Initially figured this meant for the various performers that roam the park, but there were so many, and in places that seemed to logically suggest \"employees only\", that I looked into it, and indeed, they call nearly all their park employees \"cast\" who are part of putting on the nonstop \"show\" that is Disneyland/World.\n\nI saw this in action staying at one of the hotels, and being a smoker standing out on the sidewalk in the morning.  You could tell which ones were late, because as soon as they hit the property, they all had this similar brisk-walk that was quick, but didn't look like they were necessarily in a hurry, at least not for a bad reason.  No one ran, though.  Ever.",

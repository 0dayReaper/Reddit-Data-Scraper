Anywho, this guy arrives, in a big jacked up truck. Out of the big jacked up truck comes a jacked up man, who removes a jacked up dog from his car. It's hot and humid out, probably 95 or so, and this man is standing there talking to a friend in the parking lot, while his dog is screaming in pain from the heat of the pavement.\n\nAfter this guy royally pisses his own dog off, this dog comes into the park, runs straight up to my dog, and proceeds to pick a fight with him while I am forced to get my dog to safety which hurt my back. All the while, this guy was asking why the hell I wasn't \"controlling my dog better\" and he starts to make a scene about it. I just left, haven't been back, especially since my wife's car got broken into there and the cops pretty much watched it happen. I've heard of more stories like that since as well.\n\nBad dog people ruin everything for good dog people.",

I have (and will likely do so again) placed myself between my dog and either a person that's ignoring my requests to piss up a rope or their dog, leashed or otherwise. I don't care how pretty she is, she's a former police dog from a country that didn't treat their dogs very well. If she kills your dog, you're gonna be *reeeeeeeaaaaalllllll* butthurt after ignoring my request/demand/command not to approach.",

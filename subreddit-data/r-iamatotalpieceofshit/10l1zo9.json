Dude just got stabbed to death a couple nights ago trying to go in a mall, eyewitnesses are saying it was a homeless person yet again. \n\nWhere I work isn't as bad as Nanaimo, but they empty the dumpster in to the parking lot on a regular basis, there's needles EVERYWHERE, they constantly break into vehicles and buildings in broad daylight because the police won't do anything. \n\nThis past summer one was completely naked, cleaning himself outside the McDonalds while kids from the school right across the street were all there on lunch.  A cop was right behind me going to the drive through and I watched him in my rear view look at the guy and then keep going while staring out the opposite window pretending he didn't see actions that would get the rest of us arrested and put on the sex offender registry.\n\nI've personally seen over a dozen junkie corpses in the area of my work over the last 5 years.  Every morning is like an episode of The Walking Dead. \n\nThe police used to escort a social worker to walk the tracks by my work to talk to them because they kept mugging people walking down the tracks.  It never stopped, so the police and social workers just stopped going. \n\nI feel helpless, these junkies get free run of everything and police won't help you, but if you or I did a fraction of what they're doing, we'd be in cuffs.\n\nOne of them that everyone knows by name has hepatitis and is violent, so he knows he can steal anything he wants and no one will physically stop him.  He broke into a guy I know's shop with his buddies and wouldn't leave.  Took 2 hours for the police to show up, hours more before they decided to try and get him out. \n\n\nWhat I'm saying is this guy's actions are wrong, but you don't understand what businesses deal with on a daily basis because of junkies.  We're all at our wit's end while people online pretend these are all down on their luck people with hearts of gold, not violent, mentally ill drug addicts who the police don't care to deal with, or even help us, and when they rob or assault us, the police just always say the same thing \"the suspect is known to authorities\".",

The real issue is that there literally aren\u2019t drugs that can fix their issues without creating side effects so bad they rather just be insane.",

Because liberal politicians think that involuntary commitment to drug rehab or mental institutions is inhumane, most of Americans mental institutions have slowly and quietly been defunded and closed over the past 60 years. There were more beds available 100years ago than there are now. If our Government actually cared to do the most beneficial and humane thing, they would fund rehab and mental health facilities, create half-way houses where recovering addicts can have daily supervision, outlaw homeless encampments and make treatment mandatory.",

She said it was just two dudes yelling at each other and she wanted to know who one of em was. I asked if it was the white guy or the black guy. She said the black guy who is Stephen A. Smith. The white guy is Skip Bayless (this guy). \n\nA lot of sports fans (including myself) hate him because all he does is yell idiotic opinions. But, he's not wrong here. The first part sounds callous because it seems all he's focused on is the teams playing again, but the important part is the last few words to show how unimportant it is in the grand scheme of things.",

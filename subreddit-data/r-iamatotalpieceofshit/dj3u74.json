It was his ex-girlfriend that he said he had broken up with, she had kids so he said he was just helping her out buying groceries and stuff. Apparently they were very on and off as he said she kept breaking up with him and it wasn\u2019t that serious so there was no need to tell me. I never had actual proof until the end but I never really trusted him so I kept him at arms length the whole time so I\u2019m very happy with myself for that at least. (Massive red flags I know but there was a lot of mental abuse going on that blinded me as he is a massive narcissist. Thank you therapy for helping me)\n\nWhen I did finally get proof I told her everything including the comment of they aren\u2019t very serious so there was no need to tell me and about throughout our relationship he kept saying she was crazy and talking shit about her and her kids. The girl immediately said I was lying and all the messages I showed her were \u201cphotoshopped\u201d. Some people prefer living in their denial, they are engaging now and apparently he is still lying to her. It\u2019s her life I tried to help her she didn\u2019t want it so it\u2019s none of my concern now. I did the right thing by getting rid of him and being 100% honest.",

I hope you're feeling better now, even if some days are crappier than others.\n\nThe latter half of your story stings, because I've encountered something super similar...  For me, when confiding in our mutual friends, they universally sided with her. The response always boiled down to \"no way, she's too innocent and pure to do something like that, you must be lying.\" \n\nI have no doubt that she continues to lie, and likely to cheat; but I chose to end those friendships and remove her from my life. Similar to you, I think it was the right thing to do. My faith in narcissistic people changing for the better isn't too strong haha.",

People are fine with saying, \"if drama follows you, maybe you are part if the cause.\"  If everyone you've ever dated cheats on you then there has to be a root cause.  \n  \nIt's possible after the first time they have become generally accusatory and people who are consistently accused of cheating sometimes just decide to go ahead and do it anyway.  It's also possible boundaries arent set out correctly.  I mean who knows.  But I think most people dont get cheated on a ton, i think it's something that gets a larger focus because a normal relationship isnt as exciting to gossip about.  I guess the dude could even just be picking the wrong partners.",

If you feel like you're shit, people will treat you like shit. If you feel like a victim, someone will make you into one. You need to work within yourself and bring that to the outside, to the real world. A lot of people will leave your life as you get better- these are the people who are learning you're not to be manipulated anymore. Let them go. Dont let fear of losing them stop you from finding peace for yourself. \n\nSource: definitely not a psychologist. I'm just a lady who grew up in an abusive environment, and brought that with me into other areas of life as a teen. I was suicidal at 8 years old, and as a teenager I wore my weaknesses on my chest like a target. This left me open to all kinds of bullshit from my peers. As a young adult I started thinking about stuff I had been told in therapy as a teen which hadn't worked at the time and decided I didn't wanna be a victim anymore. I didn't go back to a therapist but I started working day in and day out to at least *fake* confidence, and to drill into my own head to stand up for myself if anyone did anything to mess with me. Not be mean, but be assertive about it. No-nonsense. And just like all the bullshit i dealt with as a kid had conditioned me into believing I was garbage, my own constant mantra of \"you know what you deserve\" and \"take no bullshit\" began to do the same. In my mid 20's now and I'm not perfect. But life is good, I love everyone in my life, no one dares cross me anymore but knows I'm someone you can come to if you need someone to either listen and understand or kick some ass for you. I'm still constantly in my own head about how to be strong and gentle at the same time but I'm much better at it and dont feel like I'm lying to myself anymore with false confidence. Every day is a better day",

These people who cheat don't want to be in a polyamorous relationship because it means their partner would be allowed to sleep with other people too, which they never want. They want to have one gf who's dedicated committed to just them while also being able to sleep w people behind their back. It's not about monogamy, it's about some people being too immature to be in a romantic relationship, period.",

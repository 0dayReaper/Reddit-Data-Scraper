When I was young it usually meant doing some light vandalism of your friends yard/house....a lot of time with their parent's permission! Hell, once my gf's mom gave me her house keys and kept my gf and her sister occupied for hours so me and the boys could prank the hell out of them. \n\n\nThese videos, idk what to call them but if we're going to call them pranks they're both unfunny and uncreative and just asking for an overreaction.",

He eventually got it dropped but he lost an engineering internship with NASA and no one in our town ever heard about the acquittal because the news didn\u2019t cover it. So his life was ruined for years over a false accusation.",

To me it looks like the lights are on but the sun light is drowning that visual effect. \n\nBut the sirens are definitely on. For us (I work in for our national ambulance service) our codes range from grey (more info required), to green (low priority, no sirens), to purple (dead/dying. Lights, sirens, dangerous driving).\n\nIf the sirens are on, someone is hurting badly.",

Men don\u2019t have to worry about what they wear or where they go or if it\u2019s dark outside\u2026 there\u2019s a reason women are trained from a young age to protect ourselves. It\u2019s just a fact that men are more violent are commit the majority of violent crimes. \n\nHaven\u2019t you seen the posts where someone asks \u201cwhat would you do if there were no men for 24 hours\u201d? The top answer is always just go for a walk at night or travel alone. It\u2019s honestly sad.",

As a doctor what matters most to me is knowing theres more layers that led to maladaptive coping than anything else.  You have to address it all or the self taught lessons from life experiences that might not help us now may still seem like the way to approach things but often that's with hypervigilance, self scrutinizing, pushing people away, avoidance etc.  Challenging those and finding better ways to deal with things can give you bandwidth back to achieve goals in life.\n\nLike you can spend every second fighting ptsd, its not about forgetting, but only giving those moments their due attention and for most of us, we're way past that and there's nothing further to learn from it, if there ever even was to begin with.  Because it was so bad our brain likes to try and \"solve\" it, but the real path is acceptance and forgiving ourselves.  Challenging those thoughts like \"I was weak, I can be overwhelmed,\" \"I'm worthless,\" or whatever your negative mantra is that allowed you to protect yourself or rationalize what happened and replace it with, \"even when Im overwhelmed, Im still worth something especially to the people that love me,\"  \"I do my best to help others and most are helped, its not possible to save everyone and thats ok,\" etc. \n\nReinforcing those will eventually give your brain a quick retort to the old maladaptive malarkey and shut down the viscious cycle we get in that can lead to major dysfunction.\n\nIll be honest.  As a doctor you sure dont want to experience everything first hand to provide empathetic care but after this experience I have a very different, lived experience with mental illness and a profound appreciation for its genuine severity.  Trauma isnt just fractures and blunt force.  In the middle of it all I had a surgical fracture, again did the steps to recover committed to rehab, and still sore everyday, but how do I put it.. way less pain and burden than ptsd, I'd take a fracture over mental illness any day (hopefully neither though).\n\nSorry for writing so much.  Just a long road Im just starting to get perspective on now in looking back instead of being in it still",

And giving a person \"face\" is showing respect to that facade.  There is no war in ba sing se stuff.

The best course of action for foreigners in Japan is to avoid police at all costs. \n\nAnd before anyone shows up saying: I have lived XX years in Japan and police have always been friendly: Yes. For many people that's the experience. But it's a gamble every time, as many other people will tell you about their experience.",

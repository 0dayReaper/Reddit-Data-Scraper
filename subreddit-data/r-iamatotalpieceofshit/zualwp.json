He suddenly wanted a different dish than the one he had originally chosen. But due to the adjusted number of portions, this wish could not be fulfilled for him. When the flight attendant tries to explain this inconvenience to him, the guest starts to become increasingly rude.\n\nThe airline wrote in response to the video \"IndiGo is aware of the needs of its customers and it is our constant endeavor to provide our customers with a courteous and hassle-free experience. We are investigating the incident and want to assure you that our customers' comfort has always been our top priority.\" No more specific details were provided. It also remains unclear if the employee is still on duty.",

I didn't learn about this until I saw one of my coworkers from another consultancy firm (he was with Tata consultancy and Indian consulting firm), he looked kind of upset.  We were chummy, so I asked him what was wrong and he gave me the whole lowdown.  His manager was from a \"lower\" caste and gave him a bad review and he was convinced it was essentially revenge/lashing out on his part against someone born into a higher caste.  Now, I knew this guys work, he was a smart dude and no one worked harder and couldn't imagine he would get a bad performance review, so I was inclined to believe that might have had something to do with that.\n\nIt was a completely foreign concept to me in 21st century America, where I have no fucking clue how privileged or not any of my American co-workers are.  I certainly wouldn't know just by their name, which I guess is kind of how Indians are able to determine this.",

But your taste and opinion doesn't matter because it's their money and they're eating it so don't question it or try to correct them. Same with ugly furniture or ugly fashion.\n\nSomehow, consumers turned it into \"I'm spending money here, so I should be treated like a king and not challenged no matter how much of a rude, inconsiderate douche canoe I'm being. I basically own the employee now and don't you dare question me\"",

And the airline's response pretty much agrees with him in a western airline hed probably end up on a no fly list.\n\nThis isn't a standard behaviour of an Indian passenger. There have been multiple instances when \"Western airlines\" have fired their employees (didn't happen in this case yet) for snapping at a passenger for the most just cases. That's why people in the comment were afraid for her job bcoz they have seen similar scenarios play out in the past. Hell there's a video of a Karen behaving way worse every other week.  \n\n\nPoor treatment of service workers can be seen all across South Asia, Middle East, East Asia, South East Asia and multiple other places. Most of these places don't have a caste system. You don't know the caste of the passenger or the air hostess, most prolly they don't know each others' caste or religion either but it must've been bcoz of caste \ud83e\udd13",

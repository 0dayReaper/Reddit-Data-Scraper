Camgirl relationships can be quite back and forth (depending on how much you are tipping). \n\nLike you suggested, this guy could have been insanely lonely. If he was imbalanced, I could see him lashing out to the suggestion that he stop looking at porn as being akin to breaking up with a woman that he had fallen in love with. It\u2019s an oddly Shakespearean 21 century love story. But, somehow, even more sad",

And keep in mind I\u2019m 23, have a boyfriend and such, but porn itself is traumatic for me so I\u2019ve never seen much of it. This guy would\u2019ve found another reason. Maybe not right at this moment, but at some point. He was addicted to porn but him having homicidal thoughts &amp; acting on them is not the same.",

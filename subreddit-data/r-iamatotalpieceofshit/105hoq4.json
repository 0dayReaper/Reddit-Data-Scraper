If the driver goes up to the door like they\u2019re supposed to on every package, the extra time taken will add up pretty quickly. It\u2019s probably more of an issue of the delivery companies expecting the drivers to get more deliveries done than they realistically can in one shift, like how truck drivers often have to go days without sleeping to make their delivery on time. It very well could also be the delivery driver being lazy",

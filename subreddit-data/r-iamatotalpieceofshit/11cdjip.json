They are doing it because they are living below the poverty line.     Moreover do you think they care about gun laws when they are murdering someone.    That is exactly what you idiots do not understand.     Laws do not stop criminals.   You cannot legislate evil away.   All restrictive laws and regulations do is control the honest good people.",

Codifying rules is necessary even when not everyone follows those rules every day. Do you see stop lights and stop signs as an unnecessary restriction?\n\nI do agree laws don't stop criminals. Enforcement of laws leading to hefty fines and imprisonment punish criminals after the fact and warn others against doing the same crime.\n\nSo many restrictive laws and regulations, particularly those related to workplaces, were written in the blood of those injured and killed before the laws and subsequent enforcement came into place. There was a time in history there were no laws regulating business behavior, workplaces, etc it was called the 1800s.",

Yes we have a gun problem, but these kids would still act this way and just use a knife or something. People always whine about \"but guns make it easier\"...okay, but removing guns doesn't remove the problem it just mitigates the means in which that problem can lash out. Taking guns away wont get rid of the problem; it'll just get recatagorized.",

The dashcam video starts with the cop pulling up behind the car as its parked at the side of the road and the girlfriend is still alone on the front passenger side with the door open. Just as the cops car parks behind it, the guy comes out the woods carrying the screwdriver. Crazy stuff.

As long as the offender is serving a mandatory life sentence, the offender cannot be paroled unless the sentence is commuted or pardoned by the governor.  A second type of life sentence, from which a prisoner can be paroled, may be imposed for offenders convicted of life offense crimes other than Murder First or Placing Explosives and for habitual offenders. These cases are commonly referred to as \u201clifer law\u201d cases. In such instances, **the Parole Board can consider parole after ten calendar years** where the offense occurred before Oct. 1, 1992, and if the sentencing or successor judge does not file written objections. When the offense occurred on or after Oct. 1, 1992, **the board can consider parole after 15 years **if the sentencing or successor judge does not file written objections.\n\nThat is exactly what I said\u2026\u2026.",

Like yeah, it's a factor to consider, because the reason for all the appeals and that extra cost before a death sentence is to prevent innocent people from being executed. But even with all that time and money spent, we still execute innocent people by mistake. And I think that is the most important issue to argue. People that make the \"if we're certain they're guilty, just kill em and don't worry about appeals\" argument are thinking about it in terms too clear cut for the real world when getting all the facts 100% correct. Because that's exactly how they try to do it already, nobody pushes for the death penalty when they aren't certain that person is guilty(hopefully). But we still get it wrong.\n\nI just looked up some US death penalty stats when posting elsewhere in this thread, but over the last ~50 years (since federal statistics on the death penalty have been gathered), of the ~1800 people actually executed, ~190 people were later exonnerated after they died. \n\nIs it worth killing 1 innocent person per 9 guilty people? You gotta do that math for yourself. Especially when the death penalty doesn't affect murder rates (when comparing murder rates in states that have the death penalty vs those without)",

I've had too many incidents with homeless people and street beggars that I've become pessimistic. \n\nThis story in particular reminded me of when I was driving to work and I picked up a deaf lady on the street corner to drop her off a couple blocks down (it's a very pedestrian unfriendly road and a dangerous neighborhood so I felt guilty considering otherwise after listening to her mumble her request) and I think about how I could've easily been set up for something bad like a car jacking or mugging since using a frail deaf lady would be easy bait for gullible people and I'd have my guard down. The thought haunts me like so many other \"potentially dangerous\" situations I've been in across my life.",

Gone are the days of \"this kid one town over had this happen\" and people just wonder if it's true unless it's on the news or in the paper. There are certain things I grew up doing that I don't any more. Opening someone's car door to turn their lights off or roll their window up during rain, for example.

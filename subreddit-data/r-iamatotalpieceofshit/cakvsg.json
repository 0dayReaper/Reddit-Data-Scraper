On October 5, 1982, it issued a nationwide recall of Tylenol products; an estimated 31 million bottles were in circulation, with a retail value of over US $100 million ($267 million in 2018).[6] The company also advertised in the national media for individuals not to consume any of its products that contained acetaminophen after it was determined that only these capsules had been tampered with. Johnson &amp; Johnson offered to exchange all Tylenol capsules already purchased by the public for solid tablets.\n\nIt's widely heralded as an example of what companies should do in an emergency. They had a huge tank in market share (35%-&gt;8% overnight), but within a year everyone was back to buying Tylenol, and a few years later they were #1. \n\nSauce: There was a good \"Stuff you should know\" podcast about them not too long ago.",

Other companies will follow suit. How long do you think it will take her to pay the fines, court costs and damages (do you think Blue Bell's lawyers work for free?)?\n\nThis guy is in for an even worse ride.\n\nBelieve me, an example will be made and laws will reflect that.

These people want to ride some fame coattails by uploading stupid stuff; then just saying \"it's a prank, bro!\" doesn't really matter. The public seems to be pretty universally outraged. Corporations aren't going to let stupid kids take down a brand and the police aren't going to sift through evidence, that happens in court.\n\n[I wish this nasty trend was over with.](https://i.imgur.com/BM1jHCz.jpg)",

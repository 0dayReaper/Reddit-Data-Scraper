In some states you need more training to be a barber than a cop.\n\nThey want dumb cops who won't ask questions and cover for each other. Everything is is just rationalizing this decision for the public, because \"we want people too stupid to question authority\" isn't a good look.",

Usually on 4-lane highways it's \"driving too long in the left lane\" (illegal in Missouri with no clear definition of what \"too long\" is) or changing lanes without a signal.\n\nOthers are rolling through a stop sign (no evidence required), speeding up to make it through a yellow light, or other minor traffic offenses.\n\nIt's really profiling as the car they are following is most likely occupied by Black or Hispanic males.  But in Missouri we declared that racial profiling by police is illegal then turned right around and passed a bunch of these traffic laws to allow police to stop pretty much anyone if they follow them around long enough.\n\nSo in court, they weren't detained in order to search the vehicle without a warrant, they are detained for the traffic stop, which the officer is free to make last as long as they want.\n\nAs we have legalized recreational and medical marijuana, you'd think the standard \"I smelled marijuana\" as an excuse for probable cause to search the vehicle with a K9 would go away.  But noooooo...... driving while stoned is still illegal, so \"I smelled pot\" still works to justify vehicle searches.  Clear 4th Amendment violations in my opinion, but it seems main stream thought regarding right to privacy in your vehicle disappeared from the zeitgeist long ago without anyone putting up much of a fuss.  Thanks to all those \"MADD\" moms who ran a political campaign to give police the right to do things like sobriety checkpoints which led to vehicle searches for minor traffic offenses.  Combine that with the RICO Act and police now have a financial motive to stop lots of cars looking for that sweet cash they can confiscate.\n\nFor the folks that don't think this is happening, I was told by an acquaintance who was also our rural county prosecutor in a county with an Interstate highway running through it, \"we don't really want to put all these people in jail, we just want their money.\"  And he said it with a very straight face as if there were no moral or ethical points to be considered.",

However a lot of lawyers will say that you shouldn't take to the cops about anything. Cops who pull you over for a reason can decide whether or not to give a ticket or a warning, and every cop I've ever talked to said that they give tickets to the un-cooperative people who aren't being nice. If a cop asks \"Where are you going\", it doesn't hurt to explain yourself.",

Unless there's a smell of alcohol, weed, etc they don't have probable cause. Poor cop lost a 2 kilo coke bust because he didn't have a warrant, if all they needed was \"probable cause\" then they'd just say oh I smell marijuana to everyone they want to search, if you press the issue you can force them to get a warrant, but it depends on your area. \n\nHere without your permission, they need a warrant. Probable cause is what's used to get the search warrant, cause is what's needed for the arrest",

Were those vehicles they were driving much more expensive than they looked, maybe a nice auction item to acquire for the department's next auction?\n\nObviously, you'd need to be a monstrous sociopath to behave this way in any circumstance, but just what &amp; how much was in it for him, that he thought it was worth taking the trouble to overturn these people's lives for months or more?",

Most important, he always taught me and my brother that and we learnt it by following his example.\nYou don't know how many people still stop him to thank him for whatever reason, now that he's retired.\n\nI hate cops like this one and my heart broke for the people shown in the video.

Syria essentially naturalized them as citizens without claiming that they were \"Syrian citizens and not Palestinians\". \n\nA substantial portion of Jordan's population are Palestinians, and Israel never offered Gaza up for Egyptian administration at Camp David in 1979.\n\nThe fact that not every Arab country treated the Palestinians fairly or otherwise compassionately doesn't somehow magically absolve Israel of how it was founded, what it did, or what it continues to do to the Palestinian people. Your characterization of the Palestinians as essentially irksome \"parasites\" whom nobody wants while you defend and absolve Israel for their repeat bouts of ethnic cleansing and their occupation of what remains of Palestine is repugnant to say the least.",

If that means supporting regimes that are strategically significant, but have some policies counter to US moral values, the government will choose strategic significance first, and try to use soft power to eliminate/reduce their allied regimes' abuses on human rights. \n\nUS doctrine in the region is mostly pragmatic, and not expansionist either. We don't live in the 19th century aby more. There are more ways stronger and weaker states interact than just puppeting and annexation.",

They'd bust people with drugs then give those drugs to known dealers (one of them being the sheriff's fuck up son) to put them back into circulation.  The sheriff himself was suspected of selling out of his own police car.  He'd park in a empty paint store parking lot across from the movie store I worked and have a dozen+ cars pull up to him over the course of an hour, none staying for more than a minute or two.\n\nSome years later, after being busted yet again for meth (and others), the son was escorted to the county line and told if he ever came back, he'd go to jail.\n\nSmall towns in the south can be (and often are) absolute shitholes.",

Reversing the crack charge, even with footage of the plant, is very difficult and even then, the cop probably won't see consequences. But the man absolutely will. Fuck, that's enough reason (according to cops and the system that let's them get away with it) to say that the man on the ground was \"resisting and likely high on crack so I had to shoot him.\" \n\nHold cops accountable, yes, but save that dude's ass first",

For those of you who have never been in the American court system here's what they do: they'll say you can plead guilty, I will let you go with time served, or you can plead not guilty sit in jail for another 6 months waiting for trial and then we'll put you in jail for ten years after we convict you. \n\nAlmost everyone pleads guilty regardless of whether they did anything, somewhere near 85%.",

I had spent about 8 months down there on a job and me and a co-worker were heading back to Houston. Co-worker was driving, and speeding a little so a state trooper lit us up.\n\nThe driver, my co-worker, was Hispanic in ethnicity but born in America. Had a Texan accent. I'm a white male and was about twenty at the time. I'm guessing the state trooper saw us and thought \"Drugs\" because he immediately asked to search the vehicle. We had all of our belongings we took on the road with us, but nothing illegal and it was a company vehicle so we consented to the search.\n\nHe found no drugs, but I had a pair of novelty nunchucks in on of my bags, because I was twenty year old male and I guess at the time thought I was a ninja? I don't know. However the officer arrested me on charges of Unlawful carrying of a weapon claiming the nunchucks were a club. I bailed put a couple days later and spoke to a lawyer. Lawyer told me since I crossed county lines I was considered traveling in which case it was legal to carry the weapon I had on me in Texas. Told me to reset my court date and we would get it dismissed. I come into court (keep in mind I spoke to my bondsman the evening before to ensure them I was showing up) and was informed my bondsman had revoked my bail.\n\nThe prosecution told me I could plea guilty and take a year of unsupervised probation and a small fine or go back to jail and have to bond back out (which I had neither money or time for after the first bond and lawyer retainer). So I plead guilty, ultimately the unsupervised probation wasn't really an issue. I didn't get in trouble again but I now have that charge on my record, and has cost me a coupen jobs I've applied for since then.",

After getting an expensive lawyer (thanks to my grandmother) the charges were dropped. \n\nMy dad was a passenger in a car. The owner of the car was driving with the owner's young son in the backseat.  Owner of the car started driving like a maniac. My dad called me from the passenger seat freaking out. The car crashed (didn't hit anyone else, thankfully). Owner got out, got son out. My dad's door wouldn't open, so he got out the drivers side.  \n\nCops showed up and called the camera operators.  \"older male (my dad) got out of the drivers side\".  My dad got arrested and charged with all kinds of things like DUI and endangering a minor.  Owner of the car was charged (and convicted) of obstruction for repeatedly trying to confess to actually driving and crashing. Video evidence was \"lost\"\n\nHe's white, but was wearing his biker clothes. Our state SERIOUSLY hates bikers. Almost as bad as they hate Native Americans. He was asked which club he rides with repeatedly. He doesn't ride with a club and hasn't in 30 years, but they didn't believe him.  The vest he was wearing still had the hole in it where the patch was ripped off (he was kicked out of the Outlaws for not following their rules, which I find hilarious)",

Our on-scene deputies have been interviewed in this matter and gave reasonable explanations to the actions depicted in the video.\"\n\n&gt;The sheriff's office says the bag in question was collected as evidence, but tested negative for narcotics. Authorities also claim that the suspect bit a deputy during the investigation. The deputy was reportedly treated at a hospital and has since been released.\n\nSo basically the cops realized they got caught, decided to say the baggie wasn't narcotics after all, and charged the dude with resisting arrest and assault of an officer. Gee, wonder why the guy was agitated  /s\n\nEdit: the Twitter link shared by another commenter seems to suggest there was plenty of evidence to get this guy for drug dealing.

Clearly showing you that what they take is all on display. I have never seen a cop, hold on to drug for too long. Most importantly, I have never seen them place drugs on the fucking ground randomly for no reason at all. All of the text, and other circumstantial evidences good and all. But what the fuck was the cop doing with the meth in the clip? Was he having a stroke? It\u2019s insane that when you question a cops actions, and they report \u201cit\u2019s okay, because bad guy\u201d as a society we are saying unethical behavior is condoned for the betterment of society. Which we all should know, is not the case. We need to hold them to a higher standard than the rest of our society, just because it is a tough job. With a cop living in the culture that is at the worst part of our communities, their mental health is susceptible to a skewed moral view. Not to mention, the incentives to create or commit crime themselves with a inflated sense of superiority. Not only, should we police the police because it\u2019s the right thing to do for them, but because moral character is a standard for upholding what little trust most of us still have in the justices system. If we can\u2019t trust those who uphold the law then the moral decay is going to spread throughout our nation. There is strong evidence that this has already taken place, when it is common place to defend a politician\u2019s criminal behavior depending on which side of the aisle you lean.",

He would never stitch someone up as that is unjust, illegal and generally a cowardly dick trick. He'd chase you, shoot you in the leg, handcuff you to a lamppost for a few hours and all for dropping litter but he would never, ever, plant drugs.\n\nThat's the most horrifying thing about Dredd; for Megacity One he's probably the best solution. He can be trusted, if hated, and will die to protect the innocent. He's never racist, sexist or anythingelseist because he doesn't care what petty foibles you have: as long as you aren't some messed-up sugar junkie or ciminal jay-walker you're free to do whatever you like. Break the law and it's off to the Cubes with you.",

It means that carrying a gun is in a state of indeterminacy that lets individual officers decide on the spot who does and does not have  civil rights. White kid travels across state lines to shoot anti-police brutality protestors? Was allowed to walk past police lines after killing 2 people and wounding a third, had his hands on his gun. Black adult with a concealed carry permit fulfilling his legal obligation to inform the officer that he's carrying? He has to die. He might have been reaching for a gun. Stalk, assault and murder a black child walking through the wrong neighborhood with some skittles and a can of tea? Why, you're just defending yourself. You're a woman of color and your abusive ex comes onto your property in violation of a restraining order, and you fire a warning shot that hurts no  one? Aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, you're going to jail for a minimum of 20 years. Anything can be legal or illegal depending on who's doing it. There are at least 2 justice systems in America.",

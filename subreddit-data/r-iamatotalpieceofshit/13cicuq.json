She had no parents. She was probably shocked by what is happening with her own body. And then... Horrible, just horrible... She has done nothing wrong and had no chance to even speak for herself.",

He was born from a far worse discomfort and he himself is part of the cycle. There\u2019s no reason to have any shame or embarrassment about any of it.\n\nSadly, I cannot tell you as if it\u2019s only a problem in your culture. Lots of \u201cpurity\u201d minded cultures like that all over the world and parents who pop out babies somehow never imagining it might be a good idea to explain their bodies to them as well as the bodies they\u2019re typically expected to be interested in. So props to you for not being one of them in spite of the cultural brainwashing.",

They use rags as sanity napkins and instead of drying them properly in the sun after washing, they hide them in a dark area to dry, which takes too long and causes bacteria to develop leading to infection etc. So I wouldn't be all too surprised if this 30 y.o. man wasn't even aware.\n\nThese days though, there are many modern and educated Indian men and women who don't stigmatize menstruation, because they understand the biology of it.",

Even small countries have cultural differences between, for example, the north and the south. So I presume there are massive cultural differences between the various areas of India.\n\nI've seen plenty of videos of Indians trying to take selfies and grab a handful of the white lady tourist that's roaming around their city. Unfortunately I've also read a few news articles like the one on this post.\n\nHowever I've also read a few things about how Indians can be very respectful to their women. Their mothers, sisters, grandmothers, and so on. Some of them even being considered the \"leaders\" of the family.\n\nSo my question is: are there really places like these where women are looked up to or is it just \"propaganda\"? How heterogeneous is the culture around the country?",

The population is so large, that you will almost certainly find an example of both extremes across the country.\n\nHow men treat women isn\u2019t necessarily only tied to culture. In most religions followed in the country, mistreating women isn\u2019t condoned. Not only that, women are \u201csupposed to be\u201d treated with respect and care. The major problem, at least from my big city lenses, is a lack of sex and moral education, both in school and at home. On top of that, most Indian women (until recently) for various reasons I can\u2019t get into without writing a thesis, never really spoke out and most Indian parents never taught their sons how they should treat women. This isn\u2019t an excuse, it\u2019s a contributing factor.\n\nRegardless of the image it paints, the article shared here isn\u2019t necessarily the norm. Now I am not saying it happens very less. It happens quite a lot, not the murders, but the part you mentioned about harassing women in the streets (I count the continuous creepy staring as harassment, and that isn\u2019t limited to foreigners.) Having said that, this guy from the article is an example of the extremist conservative people in India. Not every conservative in India is ready to kill their siblings/children.",

It\u2019s beyond me why we are to scared to call out that same nonsense in other communities. Women always get the shitty end of the stick and nothing is going to change as long as we tip toe around it. The fear of being labeled with some form of ism or phobia is halting progress.",

If yall want facts, the first period for a woman is usually celebrated in India, and no, most of us knows how menstruation works. It's not a regressive country like it is made out to be, there are both urban and rural areas and rural areas do tend to be backwards. \n\nIndia is like Europe but with each state acting like a country, a collection of states who all have their own identity and own language, like I'm from the south and I can't talk to people from the north of India because I don't speak the language.\n\n My country has its issues but please stop generalising the whole country, it really hurts that no matter what I do, how culturally knowledgeable I am, or get my girlfriend her period products I still get generalised to be something I am not.",

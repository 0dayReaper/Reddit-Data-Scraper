I ran a head shop and we would hire the homeless to be sign spinners for minimum wage under the table. They got paid cash at the end of the shift, and they could work a shift however long they liked. I had a schedule for the homeless dudes that wanted to come spin the sign for a few hours, who were consistent and kept coming, so they all could make a little money. some guys walked away with $70 bucks that day cash. \n\nIt's hard being in that situation, I've been there myself which is why I offered the sign spinning to begin with. But you gotta go find it. Panhandling isn't really the answer. And all it's done now is bring a lot of lazy fuckers to the streets asking for money as well. There's I want to say 6, maybe 7 people out here in SA that have been outed regularly for not actually being homeless. \n\nSo while i agree, it might not be a large percentage, it's still the fact that they are doing it.",

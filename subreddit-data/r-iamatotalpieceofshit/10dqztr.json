For example, Asian immigrants opened up the businesses they could when they immigrated, which happened to include a lot of stores for beauty supplies, liquor, etc. They'd get continuously robbed by black individuals, so the mistrust grew (that's why you see the common trope of Asians hovering over black people in their shops in entertainment). Build that up over a generation, both parties feel targeted and abused leading to more mistrust and hatred. Now that's only a portion of the cause, another part is Asian immigrants believing preexisting stereotypes of black people upon arriving. These aren't the entirety of the issue or the root cause of, it's mostly just ignorance and no education between the two groups. Although I'm no expert on the topic, it appears to me the same way communities start to view bad parts of their town/city; bad stuff happens there so you inevitably start to mistrust that area.",

Soon Ja Du only faced 5 years probation, 400 hours of community service and $500 + funeral expenses. Followed by the Rodney King trial people felt there was injustice and started rioting. There were a lot of black and Korean people killing each other. \n\nI worked at a sushi restaurant in the Los Angeles area and was looking to hire people when the owner who was Korean said no black people, I laughed and said you're kidding, right? That's absurd I'm not going to do that. Only thing I could think of was how Los Angeles Riots probably played a part in his racist thinking, unfortunately.",

I don't think it's 100% one sided though, Asians are just generally less confrontational but are often not fond of Black people.

And the DA probably went with the \"something is better than nothing\" argument and went for manslaughter. Worrying that if they pushed for murder there was a chance he would walk away unpunished.  A la Kyle Rittenhouse. If they had gone for manslaughter, instead of murder 1, Kyle would be locked up. But murder 1 requires proof that the act was planned and intended. Kyle did not plan on or intend on killing anyone that day (that can actually be proved, opinions aren't proof)  therefore murder 1 didn't stick. But manslaughter, im pretty certain would have.",

I wholeheartedly believe it\u2019s a culture issue **NOT** a race issue. If you visit any other country, black people do not act the same way as they do in America since slavery + marginalization of African Americans has led to the development of their own distinct culture. Just like any other cultures African American culture has it\u2019s ups and downs, but because of it\u2019s dark history, it definitely harbors feelings of hate and resentment, which they take out on asians because of either hate/ignorance (lot of anti china/anti communist media in america) or because they know they can get away with it, which unfortunately they do seeing as this man was charged with manslaughter and not murder lol. If a white man did this unprovoked to a black man, the whole country would undoubtedly be in an uproar. Just my 2 cents on this situation",

Even though I had a really nice camera and all the touristy tools I really just couldn't find myself to take pictures.  You can rent lockers at the front and that's exactly what I did.\n\nFirst of all, the place was already really well documented so any pictures I took had already existed in another form so to speak.  Second, there was a somber attitude with all the guides there.  So from the get-go, you just feel this sense of \"Anything that could be interpreted as disrespectful here probably is.\"\n\nAnyway, a bit more to the point:  The people most likely to do these sorts of things are so culturally different from the people a place like that might affect.  The only people I saw being disrespectful were the Chinese tourists whom take pictures of everything no matter where they are anyway.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is: I don't really think it's disrespect for the sake of disrespect most of the time.  It's usually someone who doesn't speak the language, someone who is culturally different enough to the point of thinking that a selfie is never disrespectful, and of course people whom the event in history doesn't really bother in the first place.  \n\nAs an example: In Japan, it's offensive to stick your chopsticks right into a rice bowl or to put soy sauce right into the white rice.  It makes no sense to an outside observer but to the people in Japan it comes natural.  If a nationwide no-no can go over my head, I'm sure some things can go over the head of culturally different peoples at historical sites.",

Thus, people devote tons of time to worrying about if people are being solemn enough in a plaza of stones that weren't meant to be graveyard-like in the first place. The signage surrounding it has been very inconsistent as well, which hasn't helped. I think now there are signs saying not to sit on them, etc., but that wasn't the original intention.",

A lot of people were affected, and three kids whose parents died were the first to go in to the memorial when it was first built. They did the pencil rubbings. Now a lot of people do it for people they knew who had passed. So while scratching the memorial and general vandalism isn\u2019t unheard of, the pencil etchings are extremely common",

A group of skater kids and an ex-friend decided that it would be funny to slide down these benches into the water while wearing formal attire.\n\n There were a few other people (they eventually left seeing all the disruption we caused), but one man was placing flowers on two benches. My ex-friend decided to slide down the bench he had just sat on and placed a flower and small picture on causing both items to fall off. The guy then just snapped and starting screaming at all the kids. Our teacher was beyond pissed and guy almost caused my ex-friend to break down into tears. Apparently the flowers were for his close friends. We then immediately left after only being there for like 30 minutes. \n\nThe kids did not learn their lesson and continued to get us kicked out of many more memorials. They finally stopped once we got to the Vietnam memorial and they actually met and saw a man who had served. He then pointed out where his army friends names were from memory without even searching. They went home better people.",

It doesn't even feel like we're at war anymore.  Someone taking selfies in front of the memorial probably can't remember, they haven't forgotten.  I don't think people fully comprehend the difference between people who can remember 9/11 and those who can't.  \n\nI was 9 on 9/11, my only brother was born the next year.  Generally my brother is much more emotional and senative than I am but when we visited the 9/11 memorial a few years back I felt like I was drowning in tears and memories while he barely registered it.  To most people who were younger than 8 or 9 on 9/11 it's something out of a history book, it's not visceral like it is to you and me.  \n\nMost people sitting on the names taking selfies don't really fully register those are real people that died.  It's just like reading about any other war or visiting any other memorial.  Don't look at that as a bad thing, it means we're healing, that's how it happens.  Go to the Vietnam memorial and most people will be quiet and respectful, they'll look for their great uncle's name and maybe take a picture with it.  They'll smile in the picture because that's what people do in pictures even without thinking about it.  When someone who was there visits you can tell, the memories are sharp and the tears are real.  Does that mean that the people taking pictures are being disrespectful?  No.  It simply means that the people who aren't crying can't fully comprehend what happened because they weren't there, and that's a good thing.\n\nOn a completely different note if you want to talk about the fucking shopping mall under ground zero then I'll agree with that being a massive disrespect to the memories of the victims.  Or the congressmen who delay and block legislation helping the victims and their families until Jon Stewart has to go on capital Hill and yell at empty seats, that's disrespectful.  Somehow those things seem to get missed when talking about how 9/11 has been forgotten.  Let's not talk about the boomers who remember but use it for profit anyway and fuck over the victims.  No, like all things in this world its \"millennials\" taking selfies that's the problem.",

I would always see people riding bikes, smoking, spitting, and other things at the memorial and it used to piss me off to no end.  Such disrespect.  Then a couple years ago I noticed they started to employ a handful of people in blue shirt's who's job it was to go around and ask people not to place their backpacks on the memorial, to remind them not smoke at the site.   I was pleased.\n\nOne day I watched a women throw her cigarette but into the plants under the trees at the site.  I wanted to punch her in the face.  I was happy to see a young man in a 9/11 blue shirt come and ask her to pick up her butt and remove it from the memorial.\n\nI told him thank you and had a brief conversation about what I had seen over the years and how I was happy he was there to moderate these fools.\n\nPeople are the worst.",

It shouldn't be difficult to to be respectful of the site where thousands of people died. If you visit Auschwitz, you'll find that it's full of people from all over, but almost none of them are disrespectful.",

Of course nearly everyone agrees that it was a horrible act of violence on innocent people but the actual effect its had just isn\u2019t the same even on other Americans. You\u2019d also be surprised how many people take selfies at Auschwitz and climb on the memorials there",

I was born and raised in NYC, I remember 9/11, and everyone here that day probably has a guttural reaction to 9/11 stuff. I have seen people throwing chip bags and soda bottles and cans into the fountains. I have seen people sitting on the names, making fun of people\u2019s names, taking goofy selfies, etc. People forget that this is a cemetery. This is a graveyard. It\u2019s a final resting place for all the people who were reduced to nothing. If you wouldn\u2019t go to a cemetery and take silly snapchat selfies and leave your garbage everywhere, absolutely don\u2019t do it at the 9/11 memorial.",

It makes me wonder why people go to these monuments and museums in the first place if they don\u2019t want to really appreciate and absorb the history and information of these events.

The author that 'wrote the book' on the subject more recently claimed that his examples were made from human skin when he tested them and continued to claim that even after multiple tests found them to be made from cows instead.\n\nThere was a real push to make the lampshade story work, because she was only given 4 years initially. It was spread, but no evidence was produced. The prosecution even dropped the lampshade charge entirely. She was later given life, but not for anything to do with lampshades.\n\nIt is worth noting that she quite likely **did** help with the execution and skinning of inmates, not for any lampshade reasons, but for camp doctors in their continued 'scholarly' efforts to link tattooing with criminality. She wasn't alone in this, and the behaviour was (sadly) not outside the norm.\n\nShe wasn't all bad though, since she did eventually kill the absolute monster Ilse Koch.",

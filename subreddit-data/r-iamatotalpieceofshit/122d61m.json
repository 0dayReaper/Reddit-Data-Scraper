Of course, New Zealand only had 10,435 prisoners in 2018, with 9,661 being male and 774 being female, so in reality, a very small percentage of the population actually commits crimes or re-offends, but the 51% and 60% make it seem bigger. Edit: I fixed this for you: The majority demographic \"who lives in poorer conditions\" is very likely going to be the leading perpetrators of anything because most crimes are from those living in poor conditions, except for white collar crimes and anything similar. edit edit: also Maori women at 2x more likely to be victims of domestic violence as well",

Its literally an entire continent the category originates from, 25% of the world population, the majority of white people. Its akin to referring to africans opposed to black.\n\nI fall into the definition of both terms. All 3 including CIS. So according to her, myself and everyone else like me, including every male member of my family, is the cause of violence. There are countless examples of violence created by any and every demographic you can come up with, unquestionably making what she says false. To argue that, please explain Ghengis Khan. \n\nBut no, she is fixated on one specific demographic based on race. Its racism pure and simple.\n\nAnd \"CIS\" is a thinly veiled attempt to dilute the racism, and include allies. Non-CIS represents 1% of the global population. \"99% of this race is bad\" is no better than saying \"all of this race is bad\"",

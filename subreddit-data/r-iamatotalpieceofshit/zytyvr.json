When you buy a product, the pollution produced to manufacture and deliver it to you is on the consumer unless the company CEO is some kind of Captain Planet villain that pollutes for the sake of polluting.  Lots of companies produce millions of times more pollution than an individual but that company services millions of individuals so if they are following EPA standards I don\u2019t see how the onus is on them and not everyone collectively who does business with them.\n\nEdit: I am not arguing that people changing their personal habits is going to change the world or that these activists are not morons.  Just stating that everyone is looking for a villain and in reality we are all the villain.",

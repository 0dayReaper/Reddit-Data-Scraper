In the middle of the Great Depression aged 20 he got on a bus, then a train, then a boat and travelled about 700 miles from his home on a three-day journey to work like a slave on the docks of a foreign country. He faced years of almost daily harassment (often violent) based on his nationality and religion. Both from the locals and from the police. \n\nHe didn\u2019t steal, he didn\u2019t rob. He worked non-stop for the next 8 years to save enough to go home and buy a farm. \n\nNot once in his entire life did he resort to crime. Other than his fare, he didn\u2019t have a penny to his name when he made that journey. \n\nThe guy in this video had choices. He\u2019s nobody\u2019s victim.",

No, thats greed which causes poverty for people at the bottom of society yet isn't punished the same.\n\nDoes poverty cause people to steal by any means to avoid starvation, exposure and death? Absolutely. Thats called survival.  \n\nIt is well known that crimes of poverty are eliminated by fixing poverty, its why they're called crimes of poverty. End of discussion. \n\nAnti social crimes are different all together (spousal abuse, Sexual harassment, targeting minorities) the origins of these behaviours are due to social circumstances of upbringing, thats why so many serial killers are people who faced some kind of abuse. \n\nThe eradication of most crime is solvable and the solutions have been known for a long time. The prison industial complex is counterposed to the interests of society and is run for profit and cheap labour. \nThats why you see lower crime in countries with more social programs as opposed to prisons.\n\n\"If prison is a business, someone must be locked away\"",

The homophobia and woman situation is way more comparable but no you chose a country that has culturally, regionally, historically barely anything to do with Pakistan except Islam. Don\u2019t treat us like idiots. \n\nAnd to invalidate all your points.\n\nPakistan doesn\u2019t execute gays and despite its illegality, homosexual acts are only occasionally prosecuted by authorities in Pakistan (and never by execution). \n\nAnd about woman rights: Women in Pakistan have played an important role throughout Pakistan's history In Pakistan, women have held high offices including that of the Prime Minister, Speaker of the National Assembly, Leader of the Opposition, as well as federal ministers, judges,and serving commissioned posts in the armed forces. Lieutenant General Nigar Johar, attaining the highest military post for a woman.Benazir Bhutto was sworn in as the first woman Prime Minister of Pakistan back in 2 December 1988. Quite progressive for a country without women rights. \n\n\nBut however to tell the whole story the situation is as in most underdeveloped nations still progressing. \nThe status of women in Pakistan differs considerably across classes, regions and the rural/urban divide due to the uneven socioeconomic development and the impact of tribal and feudal social formations on lives of women in Pakistan. Gender Concerns International reports that the overall women's rights in Pakistan have improved with increasing number of women being educated and literate.\n\nSo literary your none of your points make sense.",

Elections were to be held by 14th April. They didnt hold it and then Supreme Court ordered them to hold elections by 14th May. Which is tomorrow, but they are not in any mood to hold the elections. They have called in military to control the situation in the country. Surprisingly, the military had previously refused to provide security for elections citing unavailability of troops. But suddenly they managed enough troops to take over 2 provinces.\n\n  \nWhy are they running from elections? Surveys show Imran Khan has support of 62% of the people in Punjab.",

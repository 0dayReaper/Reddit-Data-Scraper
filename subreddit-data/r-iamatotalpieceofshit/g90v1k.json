I have been privileged to witness a lot of memorable 'reddit moments', but unfortunately, as the site grew, its identity, focus, and priorities have changed, and the final straw on this camel's back is witnessing the way reddit turned its back to its users and 3rd party developers. I guess it's finally time to pack my things to someplace fresh. \n\nOver many years, I have become a glass half empty kind of person when it comes to people fighting corporations. Doesn't matter how big the protest is; when the dust settles, people give up, but corporations carry on. I hope this isn't the case with reddit, but in all probability, my protest is just one tiny droplet on this ocean. May be reddit becomes even bigger and stronger after us old geezers exit this site. Either way, thanks for the great memories, reddit. I will miss you.",

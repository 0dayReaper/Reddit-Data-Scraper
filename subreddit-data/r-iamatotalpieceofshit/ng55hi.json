I would say officers are compensated very well for high numbers of legit busts that result in time behind bars. The incentive to do this is essentially taking a bribe. Their actions are not unlike certain government actions in the past. Deal some dirt to justify your actions and be rewarded for it by those who benefit. They all keep the quo, everybody wins and who cares about some \"degenerate\"/\"shit hole country\", whom you have been raised to hate and blindly destroy everything associated with them? \n\nAmerican police to me (not all police, just this corrupt bs), are not unlike a pitbull being praised by their mentally ill owner for attacking someone because they got in their way. The security for the owner becomes the owner themselves to better protect them. Think like them and act how they want you to for more praise, regardless if they are impacting others negatively.\n\nChange the masters and the dogs behaviour will change too.",

He spent three months behind bars awaiting trial. But after officials from the Concordia Parish District Attorney reviewed footage of the alleged misconduct, prosecutors dropped charges against Bates.\n\nIn January 2020, Bates filed a federal lawsuit against Lane Normand, the Louisiana probation and parole officer he alleges fabricated damning evidence against him.\n\n\u201cIt is beyond me how this guy is still working and not arrested because he would have had to do two things to get to this point,\u201d said Eugene Collins, president of the Baton Rouge chapter of the NAACP. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the video of him planting drugs; that\u2019s clear. And then he had to perjure himself on the stand. He should be in jail, but he\u2019s still actively somebody\u2019s probation officer. It\u2019s almost unbelievable.\u201d\n\nBates and a friend were sitting underneath a carport outside his father\u2019s house playing chess the evening of Oct. 30, 2018. One of Bates\u2019 three daughters and a young child were sitting beside the picnic table when Normand and a group of Concordia Parish sheriff\u2019s deputies suddenly pulled up in unmarked cars. The officers swarmed the Ferriday, Louisiana, home, running up with weapons drawn.\n\nAlmost immediately, Bates took off running. He was the target of the raid. Bates had a parole warrant when officers spotted him sitting outside the home.\n\n\nA Louisiana probation officer, right, searches through items in a carport in October 2018. McKinley Bates III, center, was arrested and charged with several drug and weapons charges that were later dismissed. Bates alleged that the officer planted drugs in the carport in a federal lawsuit. (Screenshot: Surveillance footage provided by NAACP)\nAccording to an arrest report that Normand authored, officers had to chase Bates for several blocks. The report claims he resisted arrest and Normand used an arm bar to tackle him to the ground. Another officer zapped Bates with a stun gun before they were finally able to handcuff him.\n\nNormand claimed in his report that he smelled a heavy odor of marijuana and saw Bates stand up, reach into his pockets and toss a clear plastic baggie when officers initially arrived.\n\nAfter he escorted Bates back to his father\u2019s house, Normand said he found marijuana sitting in \u201cplain view\u201d on the picnic table and atop a washing machine under the carport.\n\nNormand then searched the area where he claimed he saw Bates throw off the baggie, and found a clear plastic bag filled with multiple \u201cXanax bars,\u201d the deputy alleged in his report.\n\nNormand was not wearing a body camera, according to Bates\u2019 lawsuit. But Bates\u2019 father\u2019s home was equipped with surveillance cameras that recorded the officer\u2019s activity in the carport. The footage showed Normand combing through trash cans and other containers as Bates sat at the picnic table handcuffed next to another man.\n\nThe video showed Normand fishing through a small white trash bucket in the carport. He pulled several items out of the bucket. And as he was putting them back in, he removed something from his pocket and placed it in the bucket, Bates argued in his complaint. Normand reportedly recovered the bag of Xanax from the bucket.\n\nNormand then removed everything from the top of the washing machine, threw it on the ground and searched through the items. He reportedly found more marijuana in that area.\n\nWhile Normand indicated in his report that the drugs found on the washing machine were \u201cin plain view,\u201d the lawsuit claims a police officer stood next to the washing machine and the white bucket for 20 to 30 minutes and never noticed any narcotics.\n\nBates was charged with possession with intent to distribute schedule IV drugs, possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and resisting arrest.\n\n\u201cHis dad has surveillance cameras around the house, which is a common thing in the country,\u201d Collins said. \u201cSo that\u2019s how he was caught. If not for the dad\u2019s cameras, who knows what would\u2019ve happened?\u201d\n\n\nNormand found mail in Bates\u2019 car with his name on it that was addressed to his father\u2019s house. That formed the basis for a search warrant to raid the residence under the auspices that Bates lived with his dad.\n\nInvestigators seized guns and money from the home and tacked on a charge against Bates for unlawfully possessing a firearm as a felon. His dad protested, telling officers all the guns were his. Bates\u2019 father later testified that he kept the weapons locked away and said his son hadn\u2019t lived under his roof for 10 years prior to the 2018 raid. Normand later admitted that records showed he lived in Baton Rouge.\n\nBates alleged in his lawsuit that Normand and sheriff\u2019s deputy Lt. John Cowan intentionally lied on the affidavit to obtain the search warrant. Cowan was added to the lawsuit as a defendant in an amended version of the complaint.\n\nThe DA\u2019s office initially dismissed the guns and drug charges, but later dropped the resisting arrest charge as well. Bates was released from jail on Jan. 10, 2019.\n\nNormand argued there was probable cause to arrest Bates and search his father\u2019s home. The officer also claimed he had qualified immunity against civil action in a motion to dismiss the complaint. A federal judge denied Normand\u2019s motion.\n\n\u201cThey tried to get this guy (Bates) in jail,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThey were trying to put him away. Fortunately, they were unsuccessful.\u201d\n\nDespite the allegations, Normand remains employed as a state parole and probation officer. Louisiana NAACP officials are pressuring officials from the Louisiana Office of Probation and Parole to terminate Normand. Collins said activists want Normand charged with a crime.\n\nThe organization is also mounting a push for state lawmakers to pass legislation that implements independent community oversight committees in cases of police abuse.\n\n\u201cTo Lane Normand, he was just a black body that he assumed he could plant drugs on and get away with. There was no regard as to how it would impact him or his family,\u201d a May 5 statement from the NAACP said. \u201cLack of oversight and accountability breeds this continued culture! Corruption within Law Enforcement is NOT a phenomenon; it\u2019s SYSTEMIC!\u201d",

            "comment": "Louisiana civil rights activists want a state probation officer fired after video surfaced that allegedly shows him planting drugs on a Black man.\n\nMcKinley Bates III was charged with several drug and weapons felonies and faced 10 years in prison. He spent three months behind bars awaiting trial. But after officials from the Concordia Parish District Attorney reviewed footage of the alleged misconduct, prosecutors dropped charges against Bates.In January 2020, Bates filed a federal lawsuit against Lane Normand, the Louisiana probation and parole officer he alleges fabricated damning evidence against him.\n\n\u201cIt is beyond me how this guy is still working and not arrested because he would have had to do two things to get to this point,\u201d said Eugene Collins, president of the Baton Rouge chapter of the NAACP. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the video of him planting drugs; that\u2019s clear. And then he had to perjure himself on the stand. He should be in jail, but he\u2019s still actively somebody\u2019s probation officer. It\u2019s almost unbelievable.\u201d\n\nBates and a friend were sitting underneath a carport outside his father\u2019s house playing chess the evening of Oct. 30, 2018. One of Bates\u2019 three daughters and a young child were sitting beside the picnic table when Normand and a group of Concordia Parish sheriff\u2019s deputies suddenly pulled up in unmarked cars. The officers swarmed the Ferriday, Louisiana, home, running up with weapons drawn.\n\nAlmost immediately, Bates took off running. He was the target of the raid. Bates had a parole warrant when officers spotted him sitting outside the home.According to an arrest report that Normand authored, officers had to chase Bates for several blocks. The report claims he resisted arrest and Normand used an arm bar to tackle him to the ground. Another officer zapped Bates with a stun gun before they were finally able to handcuff him.Normand claimed in his report that he smelled a heavy odor of marijuana and saw Bates stand up, reach into his pockets and toss a clear plastic baggie when officers initially arrived.\n\nAfter he escorted Bates back to his father\u2019s house, Normand said he found marijuana sitting in \u201cplain view\u201d on the picnic table and atop a washing machine under the carport.\n\nNormand then searched the area where he claimed he saw Bates throw off the baggie, and found a clear plastic bag filled with multiple \u201cXanax bars,\u201d the deputy alleged in his report.\n\nNormand was not wearing a body camera, according to Bates\u2019 lawsuit. But Bates\u2019 father\u2019s home was equipped with surveillance cameras that recorded the officer\u2019s activity in the carport. The footage showed Normand combing through trash cans and other containers as Bates sat at the picnic table handcuffed next to another man.The video showed Normand fishing through a small white trash bucket in the carport. He pulled several items out of the bucket. And as he was putting them back in, he removed something from his pocket and placed it in the bucket, Bates argued in his complaint. Normand reportedly recovered the bag of Xanax from the bucket.\n\nNormand then removed everything from the top of the washing machine, threw it on the ground and searched through the items. He reportedly found more marijuana in that area.\n\nWhile Normand indicated in his report that the drugs found on the washing machine were \u201cin plain view,\u201d the lawsuit claims a police officer stood next to the washing machine and the white bucket for 20 to 30 minutes and never noticed any narcotics.\n\nBates was charged with possession with intent to distribute schedule IV drugs, possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and resisting arrest.\u201cHis dad has surveillance cameras around the house, which is a common thing in the country,\u201d Collins said. \u201cSo that\u2019s how he was caught. If not for the dad\u2019s cameras, who knows what would\u2019ve happened?\u201dNormand found mail in Bates\u2019 car with his name on it that was addressed to his father\u2019s house. That formed the basis for a search warrant to raid the residence under the auspices that Bates lived with his dad.\n\nInvestigators seized guns and money from the home and tacked on a charge against Bates for unlawfully possessing a firearm as a felon. His dad protested, telling officers all the guns were his. Bates\u2019 father later testified that he kept the weapons locked away and said his son hadn\u2019t lived under his roof for 10 years prior to the 2018 raid. Normand later admitted that records showed he lived in Baton Rouge.Bates alleged in his lawsuit that Normand and sheriff\u2019s deputy Lt. John Cowan intentionally lied on the affidavit to obtain the search warrant. Cowan was added to the lawsuit as a defendant in an amended version of the complaint.\n\nThe DA\u2019s office initially dismissed the guns and drug charges, but later dropped the resisting arrest charge as well. Bates was released from jail on Jan. 10, 2019.\n\nNormand argued there was probable cause to arrest Bates and search his father\u2019s home. The officer also claimed he had qualified immunity against civil action in a motion to dismiss the complaint. A federal judge denied Normand\u2019s motion.\n\n\u201cThey tried to get this guy (Bates) in jail,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThey were trying to put him away. Fortunately, they were unsuccessful.\u201d\n\nDespite the allegations, Normand remains employed as a state parole and probation officer. Louisiana NAACP officials are pressuring officials from the Louisiana Office of Probation and Parole to terminate Normand. Collins said activists want Normand charged with a crime.The organization is also mounting a push for state lawmakers to pass legislation that implements independent community oversight committees in cases of police abuse.\n\n\u201cTo Lane Normand, he was just a black body that he assumed he could plant drugs on and get away with. There was no regard as to how it would impact him or his family,\u201d a May 5 statement from the NAACP said. \u201cLack of oversight and accountability breeds this continued culture! Corruption within Law Enforcement is NOT a phenomenon; it\u2019s SYSTEMIC!\u201d",

And then he had to perjure himself on the stand. He should be in jail, but he\u2019s still actively somebody\u2019s probation officer. It\u2019s almost unbelievable. \u201d(Redacted) and a friend were sitting underneath a carport outside his father\u2019s house playing chess the evening of Oct. 30, 2018. One of (Redacted)\u2019s three daughters and a young child were sitting beside the picnic table when (Redacted) and a group of Concordia Parish sheriff\u2019s deputies suddenly pulled up in unmarked cars. The officers swarmed the Ferriday, Louisiana, home, running up with weapons drawn. Almost immediately, (Redacted) took off running. He was the target of the raid. (Redacted) had a parole warrant when officers spotted him sitting outside the home.\n\nAccording to an arrest report that (Redacted) authored, officers had to chase (Redacted) for several blocks. The report claims he resisted arrest and (Redacted) used an arm bar to tackle him to the ground. Another officer zapped (Redacted) with a stun gun before they were finally able to handcuff him.\n\n(Redacted) claimed in his report that he smelled a heavy odor of marijuana and saw (Redacted) stand up, reach into his pockets and toss a clear plastic baggie when officers initially arrived.\n\nAfter he escorted (Redacted) back to his father\u2019s house, (Redacted) said he found marijuana sitting in \u201cplain view\u201d on the picnic table and atop a washing machine under the carport.\n\n(Redacted) then searched the area where he claimed he saw (Redacted) throw off the baggie, and found a clear plastic bag filled with multiple \u201cXanax bars,\u201d the deputy alleged in his report.\n\n(Redacted) was not wearing a body camera, according to (Redacted)\u2019s lawsuit. But (Redacted)\u2019s father\u2019s home was equipped with surveillance cameras that recorded the officer\u2019s activity in the carport. The footage showed (Redacted) combing through trash cans and other containers as (Redacted) sat at the picnic table handcuffed next to another man.\n\nThe video showed (Redacted) fishing through a small white trash bucket in the carport. He pulled several items out of the bucket. And as he was putting them back in, he removed something from his pocket and placed it in the bucket, (Redacted) argued in his complaint. (Redacted) reportedly recovered the bag of Xanax from the bucket.\n\n(Redacted) then removed everything from the top of the washing machine, threw it on the ground and searched through the items. He reportedly found more marijuana in that area.\n\nWhile (Redacted) indicated in his report that the drugs found on the washing machine were \u201cin plain view,\u201d the lawsuit claims a police officer stood next to the washing machine and the white bucket for 20 to 30 minutes and never noticed any narcotics.\n\n(Redacted) was charged with possession with intent to distribute schedule IV drugs, possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and resisting arrest.\n\n\u201cHis dad has surveillance cameras around the house, which is a common thing in the country,\u201d (Redacted) said. \u201cSo that\u2019s how he was caught. If not for the dad\u2019s cameras, who knows what would\u2019ve happened?\u201d\n\n(Redacted) found mail in (Redacted)\u2019s car with his name on it that was addressed to his father\u2019s house. That formed the basis for a search warrant to raid the residence under the auspices that Bates lived with his dad.\n\nInvestigators seized guns and money from the home and tacked on a charge against (Redacted) for unlawfully possessing a firearm as a felon. His dad protested, telling officers all the guns were his. (Redacted)\u2019s father later testified that he kept the weapons locked away and said his son hadn\u2019t lived under his roof for 10 years prior to the 2018 raid. (Redacted) later admitted that records showed he lived in Baton Rouge.\n\n(Redacted) alleged in his lawsuit that (Redacted) and sheriff\u2019s deputy Lt. (Redacted) intentionally lied on the affidavit to obtain the search warrant. (Redacted) was added to the lawsuit as a defendant in an amended version of the complaint.\n\nThe DA\u2019s office initially dismissed the guns and drug charges, but later dropped the resisting arrest charge as well. (Redacted) was released from jail on Jan. 10, 2019.\n\n(Redacted) argued there was probable cause to arrest (Redacted) and search his father\u2019s home. The officer also claimed he had qualified immunity against civil action in a motion to dismiss the complaint. A federal judge denied (Redacted)\u2019s motion.\n\n\u201cThey tried to get this guy in jail,\u201d (Redacted) said. \u201cThey were trying to put him away. Fortunately, they were unsuccessful.\u201d\n\nDespite the allegations, (Redacted) remains employed as a state parole and probation officer. Louisiana NAACP officials are pressuring officials from the Louisiana Office of Probation and Parole to terminate (Redacted). (Redacted) said activists want (Redacted) charged with a crime.\n\nThe organization is also mounting a push for state lawmakers to pass legislation that implements independent community oversight committees in cases of police abuse.\n\n\u201cTo (Redacted), he was just a black body that he assumed he could plant drugs on and get away with. There was no regard as to how it would impact him or his family,\u201d a May 5 statement from the NAACP said. \u201cLack of oversight and accountability breeds this continued culture! Corruption within Law Enforcement is NOT a phenomenon; it\u2019s SYSTEMIC!\u201d \"",

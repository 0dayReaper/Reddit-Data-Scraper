Don't throw them under the bus for something that wasn't their fault.\n\nBoth circumcised and uncircumcised can be very attractive, one is not inherently more or less attractive than the other.\n\nThat said, I'm all for making it illegal to perform on babies. Performing a cosmetic surgical procedure on someone who can't consent is wrong.",

Marriage between any two humans regardless of gender, race, etc is perfectly fine and isn't gonna hurt anybody. That guy is wrong, his ideology is wrong, and I will combat his ideology all day every day for the rest of my life.\n\nBut never, ever, will I attack or make fun of him. That's what he does, and what everyone who thinks like him does. They attack, belittle, and make fun of things they are intolerant or ignorant of because it makes them feel bigger than they are.\n\n I am not intolerant nor and im I ignorant, I do not find pleasure or enjoyment in making fun of other people to be mean on purpose. I don't like attack others appearances, or claiming that their life has no worth. I will fight that man to the ends of the earth about is ideals and customs, but I will never stoop as low as he does.\n\nTolerance does not mean that I roll over and let people step on me. It means that I understand where others are coming from, understand that they have a right to those opinions even if I disagree with them in every possible way. And it means that regardless of their personal history or beliefs I will not attack them as an individual. Instead I defend my stances on life and *my ideals* from his invasive intolerance by using facts, statistics and logic to combat his nest of lies, ignorance, and misinformation.",

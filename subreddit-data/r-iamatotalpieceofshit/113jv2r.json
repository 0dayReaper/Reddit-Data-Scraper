It causes me actual rage that he preyed on his victim, abused and more than likely traumatised her and yet he has the fucking audacity to accuse her of ruining his life! \nI hope he gets put away for a long time, although I doubt that he will since, unfortunately, these are the kinds of scumbag offenders that judges like to give suspended sentences or bullshit community orders to. Even if he is imprisoned, it will probably be for less time than someone caught with a bag of weed.\n\nEdit: wording",

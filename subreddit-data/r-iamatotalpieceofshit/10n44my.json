He was pulled over for alleged wreckless driving, so maybe speeding? yet there were 4 cops simultaneously there who immediately ganged up on him. Watching the footage, especially of the initial stop, there's no way I'll ever believe this wasn't a planned attack",

If he had been doing that, one of those cars would have the dashcam footage showing exactly what the officers were witnessing before they pulled him over.  It's obviously a BS attempt for the officers to try covering their asses.",

You can jack a vehicle, you can jack up a vehicle.\n\nJacked up Jack is jacked and doesn't need a jack to jack up the truck, whose cat(alytic converter) he's about to jack.\n\nBut in the other comment, OP was referring to \"jacked,\" as being hyped up. They were jacked up about the play, and perhaps the physicality of it. In this case, the cops were jacked up on the violence and the moment. Basically, they were in the throes of adrenaline, violence, and power and never learned proper self-control.",

Cops are deciding to kill people just because they can, don't for a second think their running was what caused it. Many are killed just because. On the same point of what I said, cops will shout \"STOP RESISTING!\" while they beat someone who isn't resisting. The fact that people can't see because of the 4 cops covering their view, will make them great witnesses for the cops when they're asked and say \"Well the cop kept saying stop resisting, so they must have been resisting.\"",

I\u2019m born and raised here and have never seen any thing like this in real life, always online. I\u2019ve never been involved in a shooting or a beating or a mugging or assault. Luckily, and I\u2019m fortunate to be able to state this no matter where I live, but I\u2019ve been here nearly 31 years of life and never witnessed or experienced anything everyone is so fearful of. It is not a violent terrifying country. \n\nOne of the most damaging parts of the US is the way they broadcast news. I have a sister who lives with her family in the UK, shes visited often. We were discussing the difference in news coverage over the holidays. The US is obsessed with highlighting bad news to shove fear in everyone\u2019s faces. When, as a citizen here, is not the case and is not as common as it seems in news articles and social media outlets. \n\nThere are good and bad things that happen everywhere. The US is a beautiful country with some of the most different and vastly contrasting landscapes I\u2019ve ever seen. The people here that you meet in real life are kind, friendly and helpful. \n\nReal human people are good. Online social media personalities are harmful. It\u2019s the same way for the US. And I am by no means a die hard patriot, I just live here, and feel a little defensive when every time something bad happens, people blame the entire country as if it\u2019s running wild with violence and terror. It isn\u2019t accurate, and I highly encourage a visit. There are a couple cities that are more dangerous than others and I\u2019d suggest to avoid, Memphis unfortunately is one of them. \n\nEdit: This statement is not to discourage the atrocities happening in Tyres case, or any case of police brutality/racially motivated violence. These are disgusting acts of ego-driven aggression and ego and I by no means am pardoning these acts by American police.",

For example, your police brutality is not \"just the media\" - Your police force kills about **30 times** more folks than our police per capita. \n\nI dont like the way workers are treated over there, with almost no protections. No decent laws for sick leave (Sick days are a joke in my opinion), no notice periods, no real time for parental leave. This includes also your health insurance. Those prices for a hospital visit are a joke, and a considerable risk even to a good paying position.\n\nI dont like the way your freedom of speech is implemented (Nothing protects the individual) and you didnt even manage to ban slavery yet.\n\n10 years ago I would have flown to the US right away for a job, but not anymore. Heck even one of my daughters holds a Cambridge C2 for English. \n\nI think the US needs to fix a lot before I consider it a good country again, and I am not happy with this statement.",

Police are supposed to be trained to de-escalate the situation and Tyre was the only calm one involved at first. He looks at the cops and tells them to calm down and that they're doing too much.

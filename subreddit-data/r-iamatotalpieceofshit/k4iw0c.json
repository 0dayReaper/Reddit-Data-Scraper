However, after the woman \"fixed\" the painting, it brought it a lot of tourists to see the painting and the little city which brought in a lot of money. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey made cups and t-shirts out of it and actually was a net positive over all lol.

Art is all about how the piece is perceived.  You can have two identical images and still garner completely different responses to it.\n\nAnyway, if someone can sell a literal blank canvas then I can't see art as good or bad.  It just *is*.",

In the second one they did they made the eyes very slanted when the original didnt have that and,, it really didn't sit right with me. I dont think theyre a kid either (not that that would excuse it but it would explain it) because they use a decent vocabulary that most 6-8 year olds dont have. \n\nTL;DR: a person who probably isn't a young child thinks a (simpler) anime style is better than the original when its just a different style, insults the art, and made a character's eyes really slanted for no reason.\n\nEdit: fixing something i worded wrong\nEdit 2: worded something wrong again, fixed it.\n\nUPDATE: The person admitted on Instagram they're a troll. Even if theyre a troll still pretty shitty and weird how theyre coming after this one artist. While i do believe they're a troll, i do think they have issues with this artist like a reply to this comment says.",

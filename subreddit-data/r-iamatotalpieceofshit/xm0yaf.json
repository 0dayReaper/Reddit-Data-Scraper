From what I took away from it,  and helped me immensely, was to understand that the emotion of \"anger\" itself, releases chemicals in your brain that are more addictive than heroin. \n\nSo you actually LOOK for the next opportunity to be angry and blow up, in order to feel that \"high\" . Only becoming more and more addicted to the feeling and letting it take over in larger bursts. it's horrible for your body though. It literally kills you slowly with the stress it puts on you with muscles tensing, blood pressure raising, teeth grinding, etc. Not to mention the extent and toll it takes on those around you. Learning to spot triggers and control it, I've never had an issue since.",

It generally starts with controlling behaviour about comparatively minor things and guilt trips about doing anything but spending time with them. \nI've never been physically abused but plenty of mental and emotional abuse.\nMy friend is currently going through the nightmare scenario. He got married less than a year ago, they have a 2 month old baby, he worked for her dad's company and questioned some of his business practices. The dad was not happy, so he planned to force my friend out. His wife had him arrested multiple times for \"domestic abuse\" (its in another country where they always initially arrest for that charge) and won't let him see the baby. They forced him out of his home and back to England as he was blackballed from the industry (the dad has lots of sway). They just don't turn up to any court mandated time he has with the baby. As in he literally flew to Spain to see his child for a couple of hours and they just didn't turn up. She even tried to delay divorce proceedings as in that country when you're divorced he has more rights to fight for custody. Strange how she wouldn't want a divorce from someone that is supposedly repeatedly abusing her. \nHe's spent about \u00a37k so far on arrest fines, flights and legal advice.",

Because equity would mean, for example, a company having to hire 50% men and 50% women rather than simply choosing individuals that are the best candidates regardless of sex.\n\nInstalling quotas based on race or sex in virtually any context is, ironically, inherently racist and sexist, even if it is to compensate for existing inequality. Equality of opportunity is good, but equal equity or \"equality of outcome,\" is extremely dangerous rhetoric and just a fucking bad idea.\n\nEdit: I can only assume that the downvotes mean that most people think racial or sex based quotas are a good thing. Yay let's go back to segregation and not letting women vote. God the oversteering is unbelievable.",

He had already been caught a few times like this till one night he eventually killed someone driving drunk. Think he got 10 years. Then another crazy girl there in neighborhood..the mom had little control over her. This girl had a temper that anything would set her off. There was always screaming and yelling in that house.  This girl along with a few other friends lured a girl out somewhere, stabbed and attempted to burn the body. Everyone was caught. She served same amount of time I believe. All I know everyone is out free now. I dunno but to me if you\u2019ve taken a life and found 100% guilty with all evidence 100% pointing to you without a doubt, you should not be able to be free again while the person you killed never got that chance. It was taken away from them by their stupidity.",

During her detainment and questioning, it becomes abundantly clear that she's not sober, and she's given a field sobriety test that she fails spectacularly. During this point, iirc, she was being detained but not officially started yet because she's cooperation (she seems to think she's successfully hiding the fact that she's in more than a few drinks).\n\nOf course, she doesn't realize how messed up she is sobriety wise, and the cop never tells her it's a criminal investigation until this point. And the car had obvious damage to the hood, but did not look destroyed. It's possible that the car was totaled from the hood damage alone but it's also possible he's slightly exaggerating the vehicle damage a bit.",

I bet that was a feeling worse than hell itself... but it still ain't dead, like the victims.\n\n\nEdit: To clarify, Xanax treats anxiety disorders, many in connection with depression, and treats depression indirectly as a result.

People taking too much Xanax, there's 0 anxiety, until it wears off. It's like you can know to not act on intrusive thoughts on anti depressants and understand that its not a good action to take, while xanax could make you ignore the decision making entirely. Some people though, it's a lifesaver.\n\nEither way, talk to your doctor if you have anxiety, they understand the ins and outs way more about the medications than I do lol",

Which is how people get into those situations.\n\nI saw too many videos od young people, having fun, then something terrible happens and people just can't register what's happened.\n\nKid will drive drunk, crash into a car, kill a stranger, kill his friend, and the only thing he can say is \"my dad is gonna be so pissed I scratched the car.\"\n\nThey also showed us videos like this one, but then with the following day at court.\n\nThe most heartbreaking video I ever saw was these two girls, bffs since they were babies, and one day they had a little fun, had some drinks, drove, roll over crash, and the passenger got killed.\n\nThe driver was an absolute mess in court. All she could do is sob and say she was sorry. She couldn't walk without assistance. She was sobbing and choking on her own sobs. Judge asked her to compose herself. She took some deep breaths, closed her eyes, exhaled, nodded twice, opened her eyes, and it hit her all over again.\n\n\nThis girl is clearly under the influence of more than just alcohol. People are saying zannies? Benzo?\nI'm not familiar with drugs, but the way she's acting isn't just alcohol.\n\nIt may hit her when she sobers up, it may hit her thst first day in jail, it might take a week, a month, a year, but one day she will realize what she did",

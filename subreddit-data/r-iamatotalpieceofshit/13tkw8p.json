German shepherds are the dog I\u2019ve been bitten the most by, including one that was \u2018a really sweet dog\u2019 who was jumping up and biting at my face, several times, not playing but savagely attacking. A steel cap into the nutsack changed his mind, and I was able to lock him in the shed. Oh and fucking standard poodles, those really tall stupid things are almost always aggressive too.",

His mother was at his house and I asked her to put him into the garage for me, from memory he was on some kind of run attached to the clothes line and she said she couldn\u2019t do it because she had a bad shoulder or had just had shoulder surgery and he was too strong. Something like that anyway. So I asked her a dozen times is he definitely ok with people and she says oh yes he\u2019s a big sweet teddybear. At first I thought he was playing, and I went to pat him and he bit my hand, and I knew I was in trouble. I was weighing up either punching him on the nose, but with his mouth going crazy there was too big of a risk of my fist going into his mouth, then I thought I\u2019d kick him in the ribs when he jumped, but realised I\u2019d essentially give him a beam he could land on and maybe climb my leg up to my face or neck so decided I\u2019d use his lead I had unclipped from the run to sort of drag him so his head was as far away from me as I could get, facing in the direction of the garage door and let it rip right in the plums.",

It's a pretty easy thing to google.\n\nFinally, the most important thing to remember is that\u00a0a waggy tail doesn't necessarily mean a happy or friendly dog. A wagging tail is simply a sign of a dog interacting with its environment. It's always vital to speak to a dog's owner before petting, as often misinterpretation of a tail wag can lead to a nasty bite!",

Regardless, unless signed otherwise it is legal for people to walk up to your front door, to solicit and the like.\n\nNow, most people would agree that a delivery driver has the right to use mace to defend themselves if they're being attacked by a vicous animal. Obviously this dog was not vicous, but now the question becomes how sure does a person need to be that theyre being attacked before they can deploy said mace? Do they need to wait to be bitten? Should there be mandated training on dog behavior before you're legally allowed to knock on someone's door? This train of thought gets ambiguous, so its best to sidestep the issue entirely.\n\nYou can avoid any issues if you keep your animals away from strangers when you've invited them onto your property.",

The dog is property of the owner, the delivery driver is on homeowners property, therefore the delivery driver, under 0 threat to their well-being, assaults dog with mace while dog has back turned and is walking away from vehicle. Homeowner could very easily sue both the driver and the delivery company, and would likely win.",

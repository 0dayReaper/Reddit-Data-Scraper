Being over 18 with someone that isn't will be a problem and add charges if there's any kind of assault, harassment etc but admitting this guy is 3 years older and was 18, 19 when she was 15, 16, there'd be no legal problem.",

Even if the guy was 24 it wouldn't be too problematic in my opinion, although I would question it if he were 38 like the other guy claimed.\n\nThat being said, it also depends on the place they are from. In Europe, the general legal age for consent varies between 14 (Germany, Austria, Italy and some others) up to 18 (malta), with most having either 15 or 16. So, generally, in Europe this whole ordeal would be legally fine, even if they already had sex. At some point people would of course still raise their eyebrows, because if the guy is way too old it looks like he'd just exploit the girl.  \nI also just now learned that my country allows to have legal sex with 14 year old kids. Not entirely sure how I feel about that.",

While technically an adult at that point, the gap isn't that big.\n\nPlus, we don't actually know if they had that kind of relationship when she was 14. The pic says \"You have been my best friend for 4 years\" - which doesn't necessarily imply they were dating since she was 14.\n\nNot trying to defend the guy, please don't get me wrong here. But when it's about stuff found on the internet, without context and without source, I'd rather stay careful with my judgement. As I said, dating someone who is 14 is technically legal in some parts of the world (china allows it too i just found out by the way! And japan with 13, but that actually does NOT surprise me.), so while I find it questionable and borderline unethical since a 14 year old child wouldn't be on the same level as an adult in this kind of relationship, I can't really say he should be behind bars necessarily.\n\nThat being said, I'm still iffy about his age. I don't think he &gt;looks&lt; like 22, he looks older, in which case the whole thing would get much worse much quicker.",

Otherwise, 14 &amp; adult having sex is legal. The only time it is not legal is if the 'young' person is below 16 and they are \"not sufficiently mature to understand the significance of the act\". So, in Austria, they actually have special rules for teenagers having sex with teenagers, which even goes as low as 12 years. Therefore, the 14 years legal age of consent has nothing to do with that, as they easily could have changed the laws to make it 16 as legal age and everyone below just if they are of similar age.\n* In Albania, Andorra and several other states just bluntly say \"if you have sex with someone under 14 it's illegal, otherwise its fine\".\n* Bosnia &amp; Herzogovina distinguish between children (under 14) and juvenile (14-18) ; while the legal age is, again, 14, it has an extra law prohibiting intercourse with juveniles if this happens due to an \"abuse of position\". This most likely should protect juveniles from adults, which would strengthen your position.\n* In germany, age of consent is 14, again. In Germany's Case, as long as someone is 21 or below, they can freely have a sexual relationship with anyone from 14 onward. Anyone above the age of 21 does not constitute a legal offense, but it needs to be checked if the person above 21 is exploiting the younger persons lack of capacity for sexual self-determination - although this apparently needs the complaint of the younger person (or their parents i guess) to be checked. Additionally, up to the age of 18 kids are protected by law from sex by \"taking advantage of an exploitable situation\" - not vague at all, good job, Germany.  \nThe reason for the age of 14 seems to be in Germanys case simply history - it was 'always' illegal to have sex with them, so they simply kept it that way. \n* In Hungary, the age of consent is 14. In their laws, they say that anyone of the age of 18 or above is breaking the law if they have sex with someone under 14, punishable by 1-5 years of prison. If the kid is under 12, the sentence is 5-10 years. People below the age of 18 (aka not 'adults' in the hungarian law) are not taken into account and can apparently have sex with each other, as long as everyone stays below 18.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I fear that your thesis that \"legal age of consent of 14 is to protect children from going to prison\" is not correct, as several states explicit make exceptions for underaged people having sex with each other, and yet the legal age of consent for adults with kids is still 14.",

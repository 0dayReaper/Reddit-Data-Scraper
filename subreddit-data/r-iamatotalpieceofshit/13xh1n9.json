That was 7 years ago, this conference was roughly two weeks ago (May 23rd). So the husband of the wife goes on stage, slaps the speaker and makes his statements along with some slurs.\n\nThen after some digging you can find out a bit more regarding this case but still not enough, here's what I found:\n\nThe wife stated she filed a report 7 years ago and nothing happened, but it is important to know that she never filed a report for the police, she gave the report to the organization and wanted them to act on it, but they never did. Again, police was not involved once, I point this out because a lot of reddit users in here assume this was the case.\n\nThen I digged some more and found the speakers name, but I couldn't find any information (other than job related) on the web regarding this person so at least online there seems to be no prior incident.\n\nThat's about all I found so far. The topic is still very hot, this just happened 2 weeks ago as I stated, so maybe we'll get some more to this story in the upcoming days.",

This woman was a resident at another school, where the doctor who was assaulted once worked at and the institution had declared the accusation unfounded. \n\nIf you listen to the dialogue, the husband says he did this during graduation where there would have been plenty of video evidence to prove her allegations. \n\nEdit: The assaulter has outed himself on instagram and the daily mail has reported on it recently. The wife in question can be found easily enough given the information in the article. \n\nInterestingly enough, according to her LinkedIn she wasn\u2019t even in the country 7 years ago and was working/training in Brazil.

Which I find odd if the man is innocent. If I was a doctor and a random man assaulted me and started yelling false accusations at me during a presentation, I\u2019d want him to be arrested for attacking me. Is it possible the doctor didn\u2019t want to involve police because he knew there\u2019d be a larger investigation which would unveil the truth? Just a thought",

This could be explained just as easily by the husband being insecure and ignorant and thinking a gynecological exam constitutes sexual assault because he\u2019s uncomfortable with another man touching his wife\u2019s vagina in any situation. \n\nBut we don\u2019t know because there is no context. Best not to jump to conclusions unless you know the history and the context. \n\nInteresting that so many people are standing firmly behind this guy with no info about the situation other than the stuff he\u2019s yelling. Goes to show that the loudest voice is often the one we listen to, even if it\u2019s not the voice of reason.",

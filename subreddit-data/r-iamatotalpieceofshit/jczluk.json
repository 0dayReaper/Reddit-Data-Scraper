We ask people if they are willing to check on them to see if they respond, half my callers refuse because they are scared or bad people the other half cancel their call when the person wakes up, and there is quite a few that the people dont wake and we send everyone.",

Additionally, if this were a homeless person, the officer would have checked to make sure the person was okay and to see if they needed anything. There are hotels in nearby cities that will give homeless individuals a free night stay. The officer could have helped to facilitate this. If the person did not want or need anything, the person would have been permitted to stay where they were.\"",

Jesus showed great disdain towards \"Christians\" who did these things and saw no wrong in it. He taught to love your fellow man (the world) as you love yourself. Ya know. Like treat people how you'd like to be treated... This stuff is ridiculously sad. If you're a Christian then at the very least you let a homeless man sleep in peace. At most you get out of your car and give him your coat since it's clear he is freezing out there. I'm ashamed of some of my \"fellow Christians.\" Pathetic.",

When you were a teenager you took zero accountability for anything you did and blamed it all on your parents/guardians? At the end of the day, people can downvote me all they want over my anecdote, but people have minds of their own even as children and teenagers, some lack empathy, some lack self awareness and no matter who disciplines them they don\u2019t change. \n\nKids also act based on their environment, so they may have proper home training or whatever you want to call it but when they come to school and get around their peers they act out, then when their parents get called to the school all of a sudden the angel comes out, I\u2019ve seen this. Hell I\u2019ve done things regardless of my parents telling me \u201cdon\u2019t do this\u201d, \u201cthis is the proper way to behave\u201d after getting my ass beat etc, I still acted on my own free will because I have a mind of my own. \n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not saying parents don\u2019t play a role, yes sometimes children act out because at home they\u2019re neglected, abused physically/psychologically or because the parents don\u2019t condemn their behavior, but that\u2019s not always the case. \n\nSo I pose this question to you and all the people who disagree with anything I\u2019ve said thus far, if this was your child what would be your way of changing this behavior?",

If a parent lets their child eat so much as to become morbidly obese, they are putting the child in direct harm. Being morbidly obese leads to a lot of health complications, physical and mental issues (depression, self-esteem, etc.). This is not a one time thing. This is a long process to get this out of shape. The parent should have stepped in way earlier to prevent this from happening. \n\nYour grandmother might have a good heart and the situation back then was less ideal than now, but it was still her fault. Despite what you were told, she probably wasn\u2019t hard enough on your aunt or wasn\u2019t thorough with her methods. There might have been some other underlying issues that were ignored due to the lack of information/mental health awareness back then (e.g. an eating disorder).\n\nYour job as a parent is to help your child deal with these issues and if it is beyond your capability, you need to involve professionals. Letting the kids do whatever they want because you can\u2019t control them isn\u2019t an excuse. That\u2019s just bad parenting.",

You have to lock everything with food or even anything edible, including trash bins. Everything they eat has to be carefully monitored, 24/7, for the rest of their lives. It's borderline impossible to keep them at an acceptable weight because to them, eating something IMMEDIATELY is a life or death situation. It requires constant care and a lot of families aren't able to provide that, especially those with fewer resources, access to appropriate health care, and education. \n\nThis kid kind of has \"the Prader-Willi look\" to me, but I would hope that if he was that impaired, he would be with a 1:1 aide.",

I am angry at people who let their kids do whatever they want and don\u2019t set boundaries or teach moderation.\n\nMy boyfriends daughter is overweight - nowhere near this size - but still, she\u2019s bigger than me, and I\u2019m 31. She is almost 12 and wears larger sized clothes than me. My boyfriend was overweight when he was younger and he still has stretch marks from it even though he\u2019s in shape now. It seems that being overweight sorta runs in his family (his siblings and nieces/nephews are also all larger except for one of them), but his mom is super tiny probably smaller than I am and/or the same size. \n\nHis daughter is with her mom 90% or more of the time and we can\u2019t say anything to her about his daughters weight without her attacking us for destroying her self esteem and not loving her unconditionally\u2026 it\u2019s really sad. When we have his kids they get mad at us for buying them smaller sizes of stuff and not letting them get what they want, it\u2019s such a tough battle. For example one time we went to ihop, the oldest expected us to let her get a pancake breakfast AND a side of mozzarella sticks all to herself and said that her mom lets her do that\u2026 Last year the doctor finally said something to their mom about how much weight she has gained and she was pre diabetic\u2026 so her answer was to give her weight loss shakes for breakfast\u2026 it\u2019s so upsetting. And their mom is apparently a \u201cnurse\u201d yet has no clue how to handle this.\n\nWhen I have them, I make salads and let them choose whatever veggies they want and they eat that while they\u2019re hungry and waiting for me to make the actual meal. By then it helps them eat less of the main meal because they already got full on some veggies. They love to help cook and we make a good share of healthy and unhealthy meals with desserts. They love making their own pizza at home since their mom never does that stuff with them. I try to teach them that sugar isn\u2019t \u201cbad\u201d but that you have to eat it in moderation so that you don\u2019t feel sick or crash in energy, and that eating nutritious foods helps your body have more energy to play games and walk around having fun. They do so well with us but then go back to their mom who gets them whatever they want again. Like of course a kid will pick candy and donuts and bullshit if they have the option to eat it 20 times a day. It\u2019s so upsetting.\n\nSorry for the rant haha. Just disgusting. My dad raised me to eat healthy foods but to also enjoy unhealthy foods once I had eaten properly. I\u2019ve never had body image/weight/food issues and I\u2019m so thankful for that.\n\nETA: I still love her and have fun with her and treat her normal even though she is overweight, I want to clarify that being overweight doesn\u2019t make you \u201cless than\u201d. The sad and upsetting part is letting a kid develop coping mechanisms through food (their mom thinks that they should do and get whatever they want because of her and my boyfriends divorce which is unhealthy coping skills) and/or not reaching moderation and letting your kid over indulge on fast food that often. I guess she doesn\u2019t know how to cook is what they all say, but there are other ways to be healthy without having to learn to cook. His daughter loves frozen broccoli with some cheese on it. I take the time to ask them questions while shopping and let them pick out new foods to try all the time to see what they do and don\u2019t like to encourage better eating habits outside of McDonald\u2019s.",

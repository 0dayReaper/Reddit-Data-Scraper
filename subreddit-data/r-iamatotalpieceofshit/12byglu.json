After confronting them for a few moments, the man poured yogurt over their heads. \n\n&gt;The women were subject to arrest warrants after the attack for flouting Iran's dress code and 'committing a forbidden act', according to state media. They have since been arrested. The attacker was later arrested for disturbing the public order, according to Iran's judiciary. \n\n&gt;Authorities added that the owner of the dairy shop, who confronted the attacker, had been warned and was issued a notice to ensure compliance with the law.\u00a0His shop had been shut initially, but was allowed to reopen later. He is due to 'give explanations' to a court.\u00a0",

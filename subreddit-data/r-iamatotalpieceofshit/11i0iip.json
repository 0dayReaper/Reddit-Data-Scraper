For instance, a rare case where devolution is part of evolution would  be the pygmy mammoths who due to their low population size and inbreeding lost certain adaptations (think hair type that holds onto less or more water or air) that they needed to survive arctic weather.",

He was slapping her and calling her an array of abusive words.  It was the first and last time I made the mistake of helping in a situation like that, with no back up.  As I faced him and pushed him away from her she attacked me from behind, hitting me with her shoe cutting me on the top of my head.  When I turned to face her he lunged at me, I ended up having to run.  When I went back to work I was still shaken by this and I ended up retiring from security at the ripe old age of 21.",

A sharp knock on the jaw could jolt that sinus, altering blood and oxygen flow by enough to generate a loss of consciousness.\n\nThe mechanical forces of the impact trigger a depolarization of the neuronal cell membrane, which leads to uncontrolled release of action potentials. Loss of consciousness ensues by a mechanism similar to a grand mal epileptic seizure.",

Six years later he finds out his daughter isn't his. He was truly heartbroken, even more so when they stripped him of his custody rights. The only consolation (if you can call it that) is that she had to pay back every penny of the child support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: This was in MN in 1997. The case file is very vague, it only shows that my friend sued and it's closed. I remember him telling me that she owed him about $16,000.",

While I don't know your ex, one of the first things she would have done in a long and expensive custody battle would be to prove that you aren't the biological father.  It would have been the easiest and surefire what for you to lose your case.  I'm assuming she was cheating because you said so, but if there was any possibility she didn't think she was yours, you can be damn sure her or her lawyer would have had paternity testing done.",

The mother tried to remove parental visiting rights while forcing him to still pay support. After raising this child for most of her life who had an absent birth father, he of course wanted to continue caring for her. The mother however basically took her away from him while he payed child support for over a year before the court systems finally caught up. He regained at least weekend care, but as far as I understand it there was no penalization for essentially kidnapping his kid for a year.",

However, a Petition of *Legitimation* is a paternity suit in Texas, and it's not just for the mother to file. Either party can file and it it is done when one or the other parties disputes paternity of the child in question. This could the father or the mother either claiming the other is a parent, or claiming they are NOT a parent.\n\nEither way, in the context of OPs post, you can't be forced to pay for child support for a child when you're not the biological father - unless for some extremely unlikely reason you lose a paternity suit; (also note that in some states, if you want visitation after a divorce or pay voluntary child support just once, that can be considered assuming the role as a father and things can get very messed up).\n\nMost paternity suits require DNA testing which is 99.9999999 blah blah percent accurate in testing whether you are the biological father of a child.\n\n[https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/files/child-support/Publications/Paternity-Child-Support-and-You.pdf](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/files/child-support/Publications/Paternity-Child-Support-and-You.pdf)",

You sign the paper and give it back to the state worker, and then a couple weeks later, you are the father of the baby. The whole time you are at the hospital, the staff will ask you where you're going if you just want to take a piss, and you'll show your ID or pass at every doorway.  They wont trust you to move around the hospital by yourself.  When they need consent to do a test on your baby, they dont care if you sign the paper or not, they just need the mother.  You are just some scumbag who is in the way.  Your questions aren't taken seriously and they really just want you to leave.  Everything about the maternity wing and the nicu is meant to make the father uncomfortable.  It was insane to realise that being a father is not at the same level as being a mother, officially.

However, I don\u2019t remember anyone acting like my husband was sketchy or being wary specifically of him around the baby. That seems like a personal attack on you, which does NOT need to be added to your list of worries, especially just becoming a father. I remember how hard it is in the beginning. I got severe postpartum and didn\u2019t realize it for like 8 months, I just thought I was losing my mind. For some reason I couldn\u2019t make that connection. But I knoww it was taking a toll on my husband and probably my son, even if he won\u2019t remember it. Not that my situation is your situation, I\u2019m just trying to say it does get easier and better with time. And if you need any kind of help at all, get it early on rather than later. Sending you love and all the best",

This country generates enough wealth and excess resources to ensure that single parents can effectively feed, house, educate, and medicate their children. The powers that be just refuse to allocate it as such. The \"who will pay for this child?\" battle is just a way for our corrupt and failing system to keep men and women fighting amongst each other when they should be fighting for better conditions for all single parents regardless of gender. It also commodifies that child during their formative years, conditioning them to see themselves as a set-piece who is lucky to be supported instead of as the essential functional piece of any productive state that the working class is. This isn't about which gender is treated more fairly in family law. This is about why working class single parents and their children are expected to give up and sacrifice so much in a country with such obscene excesses on other fronts.",

That fact that she didn't allow me access for so long was not even a relevant point. Before the absence I was paying child support and getting her to sign receipts. The main thing the court had interest in was how much back pay I owed during the time of no contact. I also got my kids every other weekend which is great but they spent very little time/resources talking about access. Makes me wonder how the courts don't see intentional alienation as a problem.",

People don't have perfect judgement, for example no one gets married thinking \"he/she is going to cheat on me, can't wait for that yo happen!\". Specially considering we're always dealing with incomplete information (unless we want to know 100% of a person's life and track their every movement, which wouldn't be healthy whatsoever).",

After I received primary custody her mom was only ordered to pay 100 a month in child support.  Every year when it comes time to re-evaluate the amount she\u2019s supposed to pay based on her wages, she quits her job so they can\u2019t increase Support.  Then she finds jobs that either pay under the table or she doesn\u2019t stay at them long enough for automatic deduction to occur.  So I very rarely see any support at all.  She\u2019s supposed to pay for half her medical bills and maintain insurance on our child and she doesn\u2019t do that either.   \n\nThe state doesn\u2019t give a shit to her either.  \n\nBut wouldn\u2019t you know it when I was on unemployment for a year they sure made sure to take the full amount of child support from me with out ever thinking of reducing it based on my wage. And they always made sure to deduct it from my pay.",

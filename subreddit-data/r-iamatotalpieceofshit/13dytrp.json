Its going to ruin them for the rest of their lives, they won't be able to successfully work through the grief.  The only respite is that they have his kid to care for.",

Yes she killed him and then wrote a book for her kids, was the book about how she killed him? Or about their life together and something from the story is incriminating? You didn't even provide a source lmao",

You post a screenshot of a title and then tell people to Google the rest. I KNOW SHE KILLED HIM AND THEN WROTE A BOOK, I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS IN THE BOOK AND WHY THE COPS CAUGHT HER. But chill buddy dont work yourself too much, I'll just Google it instead of going to the source left by the op like any reasonable one would. Not even that mad but your tantrum is so stupid when all you could do was provide the link.",

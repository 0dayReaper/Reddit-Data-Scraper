It\u2019s not like they did it once accidentally. If you wouldn\u2019t lock a child outside in the rain then expect people to intervene when they see you single out one of your dogs and do it to them. The fact you wouldn\u2019t call the cops isn\u2019t something to be proud of but I know you like to think it is x",

Are you ok? extreme compassion \ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude39 making a dog that has been bred to rely on human compassion stay outside in the cold is ok because they\u2019ll survive it? It\u2019s literally a situation created by a human. If he were in the wild he\u2019d have a thicker coat, be a wolf and he could go and cuddle up with his pack under shelter.

U can say something like \u201cI\u2019m asssumingg he just doesn\u2019t get along with your other dogs and that\u2019s why you guys are forced to separate them\u201d but if you have the time, resources and urge to help the dog out maybe a nice approach like such would help? Maybe he\u2019s too much for them to watch with their other two dogs (I know it\u2019s their responsibility but clearly they\u2019re not responsible). You could even lie and be like I had a dog where we left him outside during the rain and they\u2019re more likely to pass at younger age or develop this this and that ?? I have no idea just trying to think about how to help without dog napping",

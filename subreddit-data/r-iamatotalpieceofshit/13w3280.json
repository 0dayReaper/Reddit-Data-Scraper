Incarceration at her age is so incredibly emotionally damaging that it basically dooms the child to grow into an adult in and out of jail for the rest of their life.\n\nIt's more likely that after a short sentence she'll have the situation in her life assessed and be ordered into whatever specific support she needs for the issues causing the behaviour.\n\nIt's kind of an emotionally unsatisfying answer, but the people she might one day hurt don't deserve it just because we in the here and now are so angry that we deliberately break her.",

I simply said that when threatened with deadly force anyone has the right to defend themselves using deadly force in that moment. I don't know why you want to equate that to \"the death penalty\". I never actually said that and I do think that they should spend a good long time in prison, not jail. There's a difference, Marxist.\n\n     Signed,\n   - the Reddit edgelord -      lol",

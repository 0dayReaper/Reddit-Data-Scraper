Teachers are left to deal with so many broken children on a daily basis because of the choices their parents make. Then, when teachers make reports about these children's behavior to administration, or contact the parents/guardians, they are met with the most resistance possible. Teachers are retiring in record numbers to work private sector jobs so they don't have to deal with it anymore, and make more money, of course. Who could blame them?\n\nToo many parents, not all, especially in lower income, school of choice areas, just utilize schools as daycare so they can carryon with whatever it is they do that is a reflection of themselves on their children.  I understand it's just scraping the surface of these areas and the hardships they face, but it's just horrible to see it become a teacher's responsibility to deal with the distractions the children create in the classroom and the behavior they emulate from their parents/guardians.",

Call the police, threaten them with a gun or point anything at them if you don\u2019t have one and pretend that you do. This sounds like they just continued watching TV while their husband/brother in law was murdered outside their house.",

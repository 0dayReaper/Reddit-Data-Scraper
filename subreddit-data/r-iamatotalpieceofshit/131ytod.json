Also, Israel is supported by the world in its military power which leads to a one sided aggression and violation of human rights, its somewhat comparable to the Rwanda genocide in my eyes, except the Hutus in this story is backed by the west. The causalities in the past 21 years is a 6:1 ratio, 6 being Palestinians, this demonstrates the clear aggressor in this conflict.",

Conquest was common back then and it was wrong, as people we should learn from history to make sure it doesn\u2019t repeat itself and right now its repeating itself in Palestine with how the Israelites are committing genocide and acting like savages.",

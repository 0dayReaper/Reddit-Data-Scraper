Thats what you said last time when you were here 2 weeks ago. You're obviously just letting your new cat(s) outside where they're being eaten by coyotes, so no you cannot adopt any more cats here.

Feeding cat babies that can't yet defend themselves, and in nature would extremely rarely be eaten by a snake, has a different feel to it than feeding adult mice (who tend to be prey). I doubt a lot of people feed snakes living mouse babies.\n\nBesides that, I'd reckon most people would deem the feeding of living prey a form of animal abuse.",

Of course, there's always exceptions, but those exceptions are not the majority. Most snakes are absolutely the dumbest things on this planet.

This person 'rescuing' kittens and feeding them to their snake is disgusting. Giving kittens to snakes can give a lot of problems, don't do that. But pythons, for example, can eat animals the size of rabbits if they are grown up. Pythons are not that uncommon as pet snakes. \n\nWhat I meant with my comment was that there is no such thing as kibble for snakes.",

The general rule of thumb is food that is roughly the same size as the snakes body. Most snakes never stop eating mice, they start on pinkies and eventually settle on large adult mice.\n\nI think some snakes do eat rats, but where I live I never found feeder rats for sale, most pet stores found it inhumane because rats are much smarter than mice and can be kept as traditional pets.\n\nI've never known a snake owner who's had a snake large enough to consider eating something like a guinea pig, let alone a kitten or a rabbit.",

Years ago, I inquired about a cat at a local shelter, and was very honest about all of the animals I have, snake included. They refused to even do a home visit because of my snake and at the time I really didn't understand why. I later learned it's because a lot of people actually adopt cats and dogs from shelters to feed to large snakes, and buy live rodents from pet stores for the same purpose.\n\nThe situation still hurt my feelings though, because I would never do something so disgusting like that. If they had done the home visit, they would have seen the LOCK on Sophie's terrarium and seen how small she is and how it's physically impossible for her to eat a cat. They also would have seen my other cats.\n\nI love my pets and don't regret them at all, but when I talk to people about them, I always get comments about how crazy I am or that there's something wrong with me for having reptiles. Some people really view reptiles as the scum of the Earth and it sucks.",

Snakes will eat any small mammal in the wild. Every animal's life is valuable, yes, though obviously less valuable than a human life. That's basically where I stand. I appreciate and love all animals,  and of course I understand that pet animals hold a special place ones heart, and that emotional connection is real and valid, but I can't comprehend why anyone would have an issue with feeding a Pet snake live animals *in general*. They prefer to eat their prey alive. It's akin to caging a Lion in a zoo and feeding it steaks, it'll literally have nothing to live for.\n\nI get that it's weird this guy is getting off on it, but feeding your pet snake isn't something easily done *humanely*, as I mentioned they prefer live prey. It's concerning if someone takes pleasure in the pain and suffering of animals they feed their pet snake such as in this case. Yet, if the same person described feeding mice to their pet snake in the exact same manner, it wouldn't be a nearly as much an issue for most people.\n\nJust goes to show that people only care about Animal cruelty when it's got a cute fuzzy face. Like how Vegans who claim to care about animals but will still willingly ingest monocrop agriculture products that have resulted in the deaths of billions of Animals (because they don't count insects as animals?) Don't gimmie crap about how a cat and mice aren't the same because of culture separates the two creatures, some cultures it's taboo to eat Beef or Pork (sometimes both) and yet we in the West have zero qualms about scoffing them down, while simultaneously being disgusted when certain cultures eat Dogs. We in the West also are disgusted when some cultures eat bugs, and yet crustaceans which are literally bottom feeding giant bugs are considered  luxury cuisine.\n\nIt's all so bizarre to me the lengths people go to to disguise their obvious  bias towards certain animals, when I literally see them all as exactly the same thing. Animals, they are living things which possess varying degrees of agency, but have never met the criteria for sentience.",

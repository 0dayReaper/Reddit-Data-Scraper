Despite the fact nothing happening, the fact I was accused by a 3rd party, and the fact the so called 'incident' happened in front of at least 15 adults and 100 kids, no one quite treated me the same after that.\n\nI gave up volunteering with kids after that, and it greatly impacted how I interact with women and children ever since. Accusations are a bitch",

One had to pee, but couldn't pull down his bathing suit. Little guy really had to go, and asked me for help. I was fucking terrified to help him out. Had to make the little man wait, and get another counselor to watch me help him.  \n\n\nedit: What made me really want to stop being a counselor:  \n1. A girl with autism, had her period for the first time. She had no idea what was going on. her parents never explained it and never prepared her for it.  I was the first one to notice the large blood stain on her pants. Fuck, poor girl.  \n2. We were talking about birthday presents with some kids. One of them suddenly said something along the lines of \"only thing I got for my birthday last year was a beating from my dad.\" ",

When it's time to gather the kids all together to go in for lunch, we counselors get them all to line up in their 'teams', and are let into the cafeteria team by team. My job this day was to get this moving; I call the team, they funnel inside, I call the next team. One thing I should note is I was early 20's, and these kids are sixth graders. The kids often get crushes on counselors, mimic them, that kinda thing. That's what I think this was. As I called in the next group one of the girls jumped up and gave me a hug as she was being funneled through. I didn't reciprocate at all and did the whole 'Yeah, yeah, keep going, it's lunchtime, chop chop' as was the shtick. Literally happened in less than a second? I thought zero of it until I was pulled aside by the principal of the camp, who grilled me for an hour about what I was up to (At this point they didn't tell me what it was about, they just wanted me to confess). In the end I was told a parent 'Saw a girl acting a bit too close to me and suspected I was up to something.' The meeting ended on a 'You better get your act together, we're keeping a solid eye on you, don't you dare be anywhere without a *female* counselor at any time' kinda thing. That was pretty much it. I had that dark cloud over me for my last few days there and never volunteered again. Ironically they asked me back a couple months later, but I was done.\n\nI never got to meet my accuser (No idea who it would be, there were a few parents, and lots of counselors/staff to wrangle lunchtime). Funny enough I bumped into the girl a number of years later when she was working a till at Safeway. We had a good brief banter \"OMFG You were my counselor!!!\" thing. Nice girl. \n\nOutside of all that shit I just hope she never heard anything about what went down because of that hug.",

People are only ever charged with making a false accusation when there is proof there IS one, NEVER when there simply *isn't* proof a crime took place. \n\nSo if a woman says she was beaten (or raped) by her ex (or anyone) but they cannot prove it, they wont charge her with making a false accusation UNLESS there is proof she is making one so it really DOESN'T discourage true victims. \n\nTrue victims either get justice, or the courts don't have enough evidence to convict, a true victim is never at risk of being prosecuted for making a false accusation because there would never be any evidence of one to begin with. \n\nFor this reason false accusers should ALWAYS be prosecuted and imo, more harshly.

I was arrested and multiple mugshots taken. He laid in my\nbed, drank my beer and ate my food as I was daisy chained to other actual prisoners who did actually fucked up shit. Order of protection from the court and an ROR because there was no proof. My ex (and bff) picked me up and since I couldn\u2019t even contact him via 3rd party he had to go to my apartment and kick him out because I couldn\u2019t even go there without violating the order. He NEVER lived with me but claimed he did. I stayed in a hotel that night I was so scared of what he would do. Thank fuck for my lawyer, I dodged a bullet, but still have to live with the fact that I have a fucking mugshot now. Assault on men is no joke but my ex is directly contributing to nobody believing when men are attacked by their partners.",

I totally bought that bullshit about Adderall affecting people with ADHD differently and went into it with zero intention of \"taking advantage\" or \"abusing meds\" - I absolutely, innocently thought it might improve my life. I had no expectation that I would get high, or be super productive, or anything like that. \n\nAdderall ended up totally fucking me up, and my doctor interpreted my issues with it as being too low of a dose. At the end of a year of \"giving it a try\" I was totally dependent on that shit, not sleeping, and then needing it to make it through the next day. My last dose ended with me calling my mom to tell her I was hallucinating and scared, because I had missed two nights of sleep and thought that \"if I fall asleep now, I am going to die\" \n\nIt really is medical meth. Once I was safely removed from the situation for a few months I couldn't believe how it had affected me without me thinking anything was wrong. ",

Employers weren't willing to click past a mug shot to find out that I was released with no charges after 6 hours in holding while we cleared up the problem.  The mere existence of the mug shots made me appear to be a criminal and made a follow-up background check seem like a waste of time and money. I can pass FBI and state background checks for access to government databases but my picture was enough to keep me from being considered for jobs I was over qualified for. \n\nShe's apparently very into social media and has a burgeoning photography career and the day she decided to make an Instagram account was the day my potential earning power shot back up to where it was before the arrest.  God bless her and god bless my unisex name that was nothing but trouble until her presence graced the internet.\n\nI hope these people rot in prison, they've hurt countless people to make money. ",

            "comment": "The #1 problem with making a mugshot public is that it presumes, without proof, that the subject in the mugshot is guilty of the crime for which they were arrested.  If we knew as a society that everyone who the police arrested was automatically guilty there wouldn't be any reason for courts to exist - other than pronouncing sentence.\n\nMost people have never been arrested.  So, they have no idea that from the moment this happens to a person an entire legal system designed to dis-empower, demean, discredit and disarm kicks into gear.  Not the least of which is a concerted attack on the alleged perps bank account.  A broke person cannot raise the bail to get themselves out of jail.  A broke person cannot afford to hire an attorney.  \n\nOur jails are full of people who are awaiting trial but too broke to bail themselves out.  In the meantime, they sit in jail, anxious to get out - knowing that their one best option for freedom may be to plead guilty to the crime for which they're charged.\n\nPublic humiliation in the form of information leaked to local news papers - including mugshots can and does lead to that individual losing whatever job they had.  Which means losing any incoming funds that could be used to help them defend themselves.  \n\nA published mugshot serves to help law enforcement dis-empower the people they've arrested.  It also serves to help sell newspapers/newscasts because mugshots serve to label people in the community with a stigma they may not be able to shake for years.  While, at the same time, giving the reading/viewing audience the vicarious thrill of enjoying the pain and suffering of the person pictured without any personal risk of their own.",

In his agitated state my husband refused to comply and fled the house. Hewas eventually arrested for, among other ridiculousness, domestic violence and resisting arrest. Let me be very clear: the only person treated with violence that night was my husband. The police hit and kicked him repeatedly, even after he had been wrestled the ground and handcuffed. Of course these scumbags found his mugshot. He too has had difficulty securing employment as a result.",

The government creates criminals by passing bullshit laws and using them as a reason to arrest people (drug prohibition, for example).  The person arrested is humiliated, fired from their job, and imprisoned in a cage before any due process of the law.  No means to make bail or pay for an attorney.  The police use the \"rise in crime\" as a reason to increase their numbers and pay, or worse, militarizing themselves.  The private prisons make profit housing people, all while having the taxpayers to foot the bill.  They then use that profit to pay politicians to pass more bullshit laws to imprison more people.  There's a reason why America houses 25% of the world's prison population.  It's big money.\n\nA wise person once said, it's better to let ten criminals go free than to imprison one innocent person.",

But, this is 'Murika where the citizens have been brainwashed into thinking that crime is going up. We should be terrified of the militarization of the police. Just look at other countries, none of that bullshit. Take Iceland for example, in 2013, their police shot and killed the very first person ever since the formation of their country. Our problem is that we have this moronic cowboy machismo in our country and that's resulted in cops that brag about shooting someone. Shoot first, ask questions later. Which is why our cops kill hundreds of people every year.",

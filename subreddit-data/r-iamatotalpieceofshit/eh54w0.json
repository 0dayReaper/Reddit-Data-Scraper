It was a busy day so I set the bags on the floor(they were tied trash bags) to be processed when I could get to them. Later, I needed to shove the bags out of the way to open my door( It was very busy this day and the back room is small) and went to shove the bag with my foot using a decent amount of force. Turns out the bag was full of glassware wrapped in linens for transport and I kicked a heavy vase. Hurt like hell and definitely could've broken a bone if I was less lucky.",

I can still hear her say \"hang your goddamn coat on the frigging coatrack\" and then proceed to kick my coat around only to regret it moments afterwards as she inknowingly kicked into a brick, full force with bare feet.

I don't understand why he agreed, but he did. And, much to our stupid selves disbelief, it got stuck on a branch. Not too high, about eight feet or so, but too high for us to reach.\n\n\nNo problem we thought, and we spent the next 15 minutes throwing rocks up on top of it to get it down. Over this time we only managed to succeed in accumulating a decent pile of rocks on top of the bag, of sizes varying from pebbles through to house bricks, but no further luck.\n\n\nOut of rocks, we stood there deciding he next step. That's when the bunch of kids who used to pick on us showed up, asked what we were doing and inexplicably decided to help. They were all a lot bigger than us, so were taking running jumps to try and swat the bag. One particularly large kid made a jump straight out of the Olympics and managed to get a strong hand on one of the straps - which is the point we remembered about the rocks. We were long, *long* gone before the shower of debris and screaming stopped.",

What's the benefit of doing the crime vs actual honest work? \nI'll give you an example, as an immigrant we all lived in the same neighborhood, we helped each other out because we all had a hard time. No one cooperated with the police, because most of us had reasons not to be under scrutiny by them. Getting work was not easy, and many times we got scammed out of our money by our employer (there were also very honest employers) because they knew we wouldn't go to the police. Slowly criminal opportunities  came up, because no one would which and the police stayed away (any police that tried to investigate would risk starting racial riots, so they were discouraged from doing so by the system. ) this made the chances of getting caught relatively low and the benefits relatively high, so many youngsters were going that way, and we knew the system would be lenient if we git caught, because we would play the poor immigrant card and it worked every time. I got out of there because in the absence of police, the gangsters became the law, and the crime life was not for me",

It's easy to say this watching it, knowing the facts, but I'm sure the first thought in his mind was \"wait, wtf?\" and then as the adrenaline starts kicking in, sane people worry about attacking someone for the wrong reason so I am sure his mind was racing trying to make sense of the situation and it cost him because the other guy had zero confusion. Like I honestly agree with you in the sense of hindsight, but I can totally understand the confusion causing you to start second guessing things like \"what if my dad/mom asked this guy to check out the bike? What if he does have the same bike and my dad/mom saw him and told him to bring his over?\" Obviously those are crazy things that wouldn't happen, but in the moment, most people really avoid jumping to punching someone.",

If you have fantasies of doing so, you should probably never own a firearm in the first place.\n\nAlso for those in this thread who think they're cowboys who can beat a quick draw, you're delusional if you think a gun is going to protect you against a sucker punch.

Do you realize how much damage a punch like that could do? To a healthy person it has already caused deaths, especially if they were to fall and hit their head. For people like me who have a disability that makes us unable to defend ourselves normally, more likely to deal with scenarios like this and almost certainly have a major injury due to my bones and joints being deteriorated, I'm supposed to just take that injury and not have a weapon to protect myself? Yeah a theft is never worthy of a life, but if someone is going to attack me in a way that puts my life at risk, why should I or others avoid defending ourselves, to not hurt the guy doing the attacking?",

Its theoretically just as easy for him to get a gun, and then what?\n\nWhat if the guy who got punched had a gun, got punched anyway and now the thief has the gun. Just more thoughtless violence because your ego relies on the size of your gun",

I'd rather things like pepper spray or something similar, but while people defending themselves with a gun isn't ideal, when it comes to someone attacking people intentionally when they're vulnerable, I'm not so concerned with their safety; which is where red flag gun laws, more extensive background checks and more would come in to mitigate any unhinged people who would use guns like that irresponsibly (unfortunately we have horrible gun culture in politics), and people need to take attacks lime this more seriously considering people have and will continue to die or have long term injury from sudden hits like that.",

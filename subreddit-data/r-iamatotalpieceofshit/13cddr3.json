You are a Canadian this is YOUR country!!\" Almost seems like he's spitefully no-nracist reading that first part lol. Not the typical \"this ain't your country\" bullshit.\n\nI almost expected him to follow up with \"YOU BELONG HERE AS A FELLOW CITIZEN OF CANADA, AS AM I! YOU ARE ONE OF US DONT LET ANYONE TELL YOU OTHERWISE. NO NEED TO GO BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY BECAUSE YOU ARE CURRENTLY IN YOUR COUNTRY\"\ud83d\ude02\n\nAt least the guy doing the D-baggery appeared to be  understanding and accept that he got himself kicked out of the group without protesting. What was he even responding to in the first place? Seems like he got a bit set off for no reason. How long was he riding with you guys and a part of the group? This day and age, it can be very hard as an adult to make friends and be part of something meaningful, I wonder if he just lost himself his only means of social interaction.",

                    "comment": "She is a new rider. Had posted in another group trying to find other people (esp. women) to potentially ride with. She had a sport-touring bike and didn\u2019t feel like she fit in with cruisers. I have a sport bike and was open to riding with her. After I saw her comments and whatnot I noped right out of that. Not a chance. She can ride by herself. \n\nHer comments were in a motorcycle group responding to a new rider who was asking for help regarding a minor maintenance issue for his bike. He did not want to take it to a shop as he had been ripped off not long ago (which is not uncommon when you don\u2019t know anything about bikes and are relying on another person\u2019s expertise to tell you what you need and what it costs), so he was looking for someone private who was mechanically inclined. It led to a debate about whether or not it is safe to take a bike to an unlicensed or private mechanic. A lot of people started acting like jerks, including this woman, who got bent about him saying he was Pakistani but born in Canada. She started digging herself in and just couldn\u2019t stop. It was so incredibly unnecessary and such an A-hole thing to say, especially from someone who has no idea what they are talking about.",

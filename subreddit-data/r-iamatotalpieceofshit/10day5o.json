Sorry for any inaccuracies.\n\nAt 3:33PM, on the third floor, a living piece of the country's history is the new victim: the clock brought to Brazil by Jo\u00e3o VI in 1808.\nNext, the man displaces furnitures and tries to turn off the floor's circuit breakers.\n\nWhile he moves away, smoke pour down from the stairs. It's coming from one of the fire extinguishers broken by another vandal on another floor.\n\nSeconds later the same man comes back with a fire extinguisher to try and erase his criminal act. He throws it against the security camera.\n\nWith the face and surname of his idol on his shirt, the angry fan of the ex-president (Bolsonaro) notes that the camera resisted the first impact.\n\nHe tries again. And again. And finally gives up.",

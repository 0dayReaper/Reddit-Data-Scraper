An AR-15 is functionally no different than an M1A that you could order from a Sears catalogue in the 70s and have delivered right to your door. It\u2019s semi-auto, it uses a 20-round mag, and it actually uses a more powerful cartridge than a standard AR (7.62 vs 5.56). Gun control laws are stricter now than they were in the 70s, yet we have a mass shooting problem now that we didn\u2019t then. \n\nGun control is effectively treating the symptom and not the disease; the disease is that people are fundamentally unhappy and mentally ill, because that\u2019s the society we\u2019ve created. We didn\u2019t have mass shooters when we had wealth equality\u2014when CEO-to-worker compensation was 20:1 instead of 400:1\u2014and a man could support a wife and three kids on a high school education. But both parties are controlled by corporate interests and don\u2019t want to have that conversation, because ultimately treating wealthy inequality means the people that buy and sell our politicians will lose money.",

In the next decade, there could be a divide between those who control the economy and government, versus the rest of us. These people prioritize wealth and power over the needs of marginalized groups. The current system rewards companies for endless growth, but this is not sustainable in a finite world. Unfortunately, the heaviest burden falls on the poorest members of society, as they are taxed and charged unfairly. Although every tragedy is significant, mass shootings garner more attention than the day-to-day struggles of those who are nothing more than numbers on a spreadsheet living in poverty without access to healthcare or who are affected by conflict. In the coming years, there could be a conflict due to the growing disparity in quality of life, especially as resources dwindle and climate change worsens. However, there is hope that people will come together, put aside differences and work towards a future where power is restored to the people.\n\nWe are divided on such ignorant things look at the issues debated between the left and right. For example Trans people are like .003% of the population and are at risk of being put in literal concentration camps. The ignorance or lack of education on the matters that the political right take arms up on are so insignificant and serve no actual positive gain for anyone. Of the political figures at hand no-one debates on Healthcare, Government spending, etc anymore. Those in power are winning as they convince the gullible half of the population that such insignificant aspects of society are literal life or death (and they believe it too). The gays and trans are coming for your kids, immigrants are coming by the millions over the border to ruin our country, they want to take your guns and implant microchips in you. And it's working, these lies are working so so so so well that I find it hard to believe that we will ever have a future.",

It appears to be centered around the idea that the AR-15 and similar firearms are effectively miracles, that they can be used to fix problems and keep bad things away. \n\nThat is exacerbated by the lower educational standards, reduction in school funding and therefore extracurriculars and electives, and obviously everything you mentioned.\n\nBeau of the Fifth Column, a leftist on YouTube, made a pretty solid argument for fighting canned culture with canned culture. I can't explain it as well as he can, but if you look for his video entitled \"Let's talk about a comprehensive gun control strategy....\" he covers it pretty solidly. The whole video is just over 8 minutes long, but it's well worth the time, IMHO.",

A lot of this is attributed to a safer society: lower access to easy targets, a higher prevalence of cameras, children taught to avoid strangers ect . It's too hard now to murder a bunch of hitchhikers and get away with it. Many have argued that serial killers have not disappeared but transformed into mass shooters as  mass shooters have overlapping personality characteristics like cruelty to animals and antisocial behavior.",

You are adding important nuance to the mental health angle, which is too often used as an escape hatch to protect firearm manufacturers. \n\nThat said, I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s *not* a gun issue as well. When the *culture* catalyzes it, degrees of availability absolutely matter. It can be both things: culture and available weapon tech. And it is. I\u2019m also very pessimistic that a cultural shift like what is proposed here is feasible as a solution for violence in our time. That\u2019s effectively overthrowing capitalism and handling the alienation of the entire country. The other is a series of specifically and frequently articulated legislative proposals such as bans/buybacks on certain firearms, closing loopholes, and tracking a specific prices of tech better. Just like the firearm itself, on is a more useful tool to accomplish the end goal. \n\nOther countries, adjusted for pop, just don\u2019t have a similar issue. AR-15s are the massacre firearm *de jour* and not for completely arbitrary reasons. They work. They really really work. At room range, they do roughly the same thing to first graders as most firearms. A .22 that close on a six year old kills them pretty quickly. It\u2019s just a question of how messy one wants one\u2019s meat. Splitting hairs at that point is just sidestepping the point. \n\nThe AR-15 is very good for people who don\u2019t have much sophistication to have fast affordable access to a platform that just demolishes first graders. They don\u2019t spend years developing a firearm enthusiast hobby before doing this. They aren\u2019t testing on ranges. They don\u2019t care about muzzle velocity. It\u2019s a quick dirty calculus. I hope no one has a better recommendation for the best gun for killing students. \n\nI\u2019m always leery of explanatory arguments that seem to foreclose discussion, especially when put in the language of \u201chard truths\u201d. That seems to suggest an inference that people who disagree simply have a softness, an emotional barrier that they would get past if they simply looked at the facts and weren\u2019t so entrenched. Both discussions need to be had. And we should be very very critical about whether those discussions are being had in true academic good faith or as a tool to avoid something else.",

The wealth inequality worse than before the French Revolution happens in other countries, massive spikes in mental disorders because there is no way lives going to improve and thus no hope happens elsewhere. \n\nAll of those problems exist elsewhere. It is solely the US that led to mass shootings.\n\n\nAnd it\u2018s quite clear that no gun regulations /are/ the reason mass ahootings happen.\n\nIf you look at studies around the circumstances of these made Shootings it\u2018s virtually never people who are into guns as a hobby, I.E. owned them for a long time, would pass regulations and get permits.\n\nIt is either people obtaining them from their families who do not correctly store guns or most commonly obtain them in the days and weeks prior to their attack by just walking into a shop and legally obtaining them.\n\n\nMeaning if there was regulations, you\u2019d have to pass tests to be allowed a permit for owning guns; guns had to be registered, sales would have back ground checks, most of these attacks would be stopped.\n\n\n\nThis has been shown for other instances of suicides as well. When paracetamol sale is limited to blistered boxes of 20, suicide rates through that mean were nearly cut in half.\n\nBecause someone with suicidal ideation (and not a long term plan of ending their live sue to permanent health concerns that are not fixable) can be prevented from spur of the moment suicides simply by making it slightly more of a hassle. Instead of selling tubs of 1000 that every household has at home.\n\n\nIf you already have the pills at home, it only takes minutes of excacerbated suicidal ideation to attempt. If you first have to go out to 2 or more pharmacies, you got long enough to think about it. Not to mention depression frequently comes with extreme lethargy, so even the having to go out part is enough of a barrier.\n\n\n\nSimilarly then with guns: if you first need to fill out paperwork, send it off to places etc, it prevents this. Without stopping a random hobbyist from owning guns and using them in acceptable manners.\n\n\nLike why have drivers licenses for cars but allow every adult to just buy a gun if they manage to scrounge around for a few hundred bucks?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously there\u2018s further causes for the need to go out in a murder suicide. But those will not be fixed under capitalist feudalism ever.\n\nThe way things are now, is exactly as the billionaires need them to be. Why would they allow change?",

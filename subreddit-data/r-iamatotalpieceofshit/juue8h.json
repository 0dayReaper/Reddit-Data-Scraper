Yeah they should have stopped sooner but the law doesn't look kindly on an armed person attacking unarmed people. It's why it wouldn't end up as murder, but a \"lesser\" charge like manslaughter.\n\nIt's true about starting fights, any good firearm instructor preaches about removing your self from dangerous situations if you can.",

Moreover, he wouldn\u2019t be able to use that same legal defense if he\u2019d shot them, since he was the initial aggressor.\n\nLike jfc has everyone forgotten that death is a permanent medical condition?",

Age doesn't mean intelligence, and if your bravery only goes as far as the barrel of your sidearm, you really don't have the right to call yourself a man. A real man wouldn't start a fight with a bunch of kids, but clearly this guy's ego wouldn't let him walk away.",

I cried, I screamed and I pleaded that my suffering be over.  I was drenched in tears and kept repeating \u201cMy gut told me not to, but I didn\u2019t listen..why didn\u2019t I listen to my instincts\u201d as my husband held me tightly in his arms.\"  \n\n\nFrom the second post:  \n\n\n\"**The truth of the matter is** that I was afraid to talk about it.  Frightened by the outcome or result of being so vulnerable.  Unwilling to admit how drastically my life has changed over the past 5 months.  Worried about the unwanted attention by people that won\u2019t ever understand or relate to what I\u2019m going through.  But most of all, broken down to the point that for the first time in my adult life I am asking for help from friends and even complete strangers.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHolup, chicca\n\nLet me just stop you right there....",

I used to have to go to these awful doctors appointments with \u201cindependent medical examiners\u201d who were not at all impartial third parties like they were supposed to be. One tried to sexually assault me. This creepy old man tried to get me to take off my clothes to \u201csee how I undressed.\u201d I lost my shit at him and told him I wasn\u2019t playing his sick game.\n\nThey would hurt me in order to try to disprove my disabilities and I\u2019d be in such excessive pain for days. My lawyer would bring it up in our court hearings and it wasn\u2019t even shocking information to the judge, my lawyer, or the insurance company. It was business as usual. I was told if I didn\u2019t go to these court ordered appointments I\u2019d lose all of my insurance benefits and the measly $1000 a month that I got for not being able to work at all.\n\nI was told I\u2019d never be granted permanent or total disability status even though I was fucking bedridden.\n\nFor months leading up to the appointments I would be so insanely anxious about losing my health care because it would mean I\u2019d have to kill myself. Finally, I saw a doctor who was able to put a stop to all of it and refused to let me be tortured any further.\n\nBut by that point, the system had already broken me. I was so deep in despair and so crippled with fear what physical functionality I had left was overshadowed by extreme mental health duress.",

I'm tired of hiding my disgust for anti-vax patients with my customer service face.\n\n\n- Why would she have EEG pads on while in the driver's seat of her car? Anyone needing an EEG is absolutely NOT driving around. Those EKG pads aren't placed properly either.\n\n\n- If you need constant pulse oximetery, you're on oxygen, on a strict regimen of breathing treatments, have a home healthcare nurse, or you're in the hospital. Home pulse oximeters are usually small, wireless, battery operated devices that clip onto the finger tip. They typically do **not** have a long cord outside a hospital setting.\n\n\n- That bed looks way too damn comfortable to be in a hospital. It doesn't have side rails either. \n\n\n- Why isn't she using any assistive devices when walking?  Where's physical therapy? A physical therapist would never leave the side of a patient who is a fall risk.\n\n\n- How come she isn't showing off any prescription medications? Wouldn't *that* be good evidence? No gabapentin or inhalers or anything?\n\n\nWhy? Why are these people trying so hard to be victims?  I'm so sick of this shit. There are people who truly do suffer from adverse effects with vaccines and shit like this only takes away from their struggle. \n\n\nFor fuck's sake just get the goddamn vaccine. The people who truly can't depend on everyone else doing so. There's better shit to do than whoring yourself out for attention with terrible acting.",

            "comment": "Tbh, all those electrodes could be real (they're not), she could've easily gone to the hospital faking seizures and we'd have to do a work up to cover our ass and while she's getting an actual ECG and EEG done she could video herself. And when she goes to the emergency department faking seizures and asking for an IV drip, they do it for her and slap on a pulse oximetry and boom you get another good picture. But she should absolutely not be driving if she has seizures. \n\nBut yeah, as a doctor, it's fairly obvious to me that these are pseudoseizures. If they're bilateral then she would be unconscious and non-responsive (generalized tonic clinic). If they're continuous she'd be in major trouble (status epileptics). The only time you'd be conscious and have a seizure is focal aware seizures (simple partial seizures) where one arm or leg has tonic-clonic activity and it's incredibly uncomfortable and disorienting and scary. Not something you want to repeat. \n\nI've seen many pseudoseizures and real seizures. We had a frequent flier once and I just asked her, you're faking this seizure, right? And she stopped and looked at me indignantly \"I AM NOT FAKING THIS SEIZURE!\"  then went right back to spasming. So I rolled my eyes and said ok, here's some midazolam and pushed normal saline into her drip and she started to calm down.\n\nEdit: I went to look more in-depth at her issue and it looks like she's being investigated for dystonia. I don't want to say that she has or doesn't have dystonia but I have seen dystonic patients and this doesn't really fit the bill.",

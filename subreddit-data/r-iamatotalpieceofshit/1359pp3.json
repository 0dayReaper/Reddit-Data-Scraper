The problem is that it's expensive, and the only people who can afford to pay for the infrastructure needed to do this don't even care about human lives, let alone animal lives.\n\nEvery time I hear these fucked up euthanizia stories, all I'm reminded is that the only thing that animal really died for was to upkeep the elites indifference to their existence.",

When I was a kid we lived in the country and used to leave our doors unlocked at night and knew everyone on the block. Now though? Im now in my 30\u2019s and every time I take my dog for a walk my grip tightens on her leash because I don\u2019t know what the next person approaching is going to be like.\n\nTwo years ago I had an SUV full of teenagers pull up while I was walking my pup and they offered to buy her off me for 5K in cash. I\u2019d heard about this bit not even two weeks prior, people running dog fighting rings from out of state come in and offer to buy your dog or steal it if it\u2019s left unattended. Every time I said no they got more persistent and more aggressive. I only had a walking stick on me and I had to threaten to kill them for them to leave me be and even that was all bluster. Five of them vs me? I\u2019m glad they weren\u2019t confident at all, it was a terrifying experience",

Couple tried for a couple of weeks, kept them separated and tried to get them used to each other. Nope. Finally a fight happened. They brought the old male in with injuries. Vet said they would keep overnight to stitch up and calm him from shaking and fear. Vet said when they pick up old male, bring in female with her vax &amp; papers. \nThey came next day and made the switch and told doctor there is no paperwork. Female never spayed and no idea of or if any shots ever given. Vet said he would keep her and examine for Ravi and call him with price of all procedures to be done. Vet called next day. Coworkers and his wife said it was too much money. Put her down.  He and his wife each drive $75k vehicles and last I heard was going to local shelters to adopt.

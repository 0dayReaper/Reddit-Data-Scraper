I started off always being the one designated driving because the captain only trusted me with the rental and work vehicles when he wasn't around. I had been offered drinks by strangers and friend alike in over 50 bars in different locations in a little over a year. It wasn't hard for me because I had already reached my rock bottom. Meaning, I had burned all my friendships and family relationships, I had no job, had no place to live, somehow I was selling weed out of my backpack but that was all I had left, my liver and kidneys were maxed out. For anyone that wants to experience true loneliness, be a homeless person in any city for a month, it will change your outlook. I realized the alcohol and drug use was why I was so lonely. And one day I bought a beer at a bar and took one sip and then pushed it back toward the bartender and left.",

It's a shame that in 2023 AA seems to be the go to for \"treatment\", quite often forced on you by judges/law/family/work etc. when it's faith based and generally isn't successful for most who participate. If AA works for someones recovery that is amazing! however we need to be focusing on a CBT approach and include harm reduction to as opposed to strictly abstinence. For instance you had mentioned alcohol landed you on the streets but there must have been a reason you were self medicating to begin with I'd imagine. Anyways congrats again on your achievement and know it's hard.",

There are many many people in AA who are atheists.\n\nAre you an alcoholic? It\u2019s super dangerous to preach harm reduction as a replacement for abstinence. Almost all alcoholics can tell you that it\u2019s a fools game to try to moderate. If you could moderate your drinking, you wouldn\u2019t be an alcoholic, now would you? \ud83d\ude09\n\nLook up the story of Audrey Kishline, who founded Moderation Management after using CBT to limit her drinking, for people who wanted an alternative to AA that instead of aiming for abstinence instead aimed for moderation. \n\nShe killed a man and his 12 year old daughter in a DUI and eventually committed suicide. \n\nAlcoholics simply cannot drink in moderation without the assistance of Naltrexone. Their brains produce more dopamine when drinking and it makes alcohol much more addictive than it does to the normal person. \n\n(Technically alcohol is generally addictive and even people with typical brain chemistry can become addicted, so fine, fair enough, those people can probably go back to moderation. Is it a great idea to gamble with your life that you\u2019re one of those exceptions? It\u2019s a really seductive idea. And after enough time sober, it becomes hard to remember why you had a problem in the first place\u2026)",

You saying alcoholics cannot drink in moderation presumes the fact that have the desire to. \n\nBeing able to systematically approach AUD from a comprehensive, holistic approach that stresses increased standard of living creates a markedly noticeable increase in success rates.\n\nUnfortunately, people who follow the 12 steps seem to forget that success isn\u2019t measured by lack of drinking or abstinence, but rather by the increased standard of living and reduction of harm.\n\nImagine if a person with an alcohol use disorder who drinks a handle of vodka came up to you and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to drink vodka, I would rather drink beer.\u201d Well, harm reduction and the philosophies behind it will dictate that you help this man start drinking beer instead of vodka. There is a clear indication of a desire to change, but a lack of ability to do so at the moment. What would you do to him? Would you say no? You can only live if you are totally abstinent of alcohol? Then you are essentially declaring that Man a deadman. \n\nHi, I am a person with five years of recovery about alcohol, methamphetamine, and heroin. I am a Recovery Specialist and I am literally a part of the community that preaches harm reduction. I have seen harm reduction save more lives than I have seen saved by AA or NA. And that in no way is a dig on the 12 steps. I have seen those save peoples\u2019 lives as wellS \n\nI fully respect it and I actively encourage appears who I help to look into it as an option for getting into recovery. Anything to live a better life.\n\nYou shutting it down like that is what leads these people to death.\n\nEdit: spelling and word choice (twice)",

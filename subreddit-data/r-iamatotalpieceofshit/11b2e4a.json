Here, there are a lot more police patrols than in France (at least in major cities), and they sometimes run a licence plate on their database to see if something has been reported for it. If so, they would pull them over. For instance, witnesses have reported a license plate for reckless driving, it would be saved in the Police database. This way if randomly a patrol run the plate, or during a random traffic stop, it would come up and the Police would be extra suspicious about the owner of the plate.\n\nThere is nothing like that in France, you get caught or you don't. And usually Police do not like to chase reckless drivers, as if anything happen to anyone it could be legally acceptable to say the reckless driver caused an incident because it was being chased by the police. (A law that was voted following 2005 incidents that led two teenagers to die because they wanted to flee a police car chasing them)",

The other man was charged with manslaughter and not murder. Even though they were willfully fighting, and committing a criminal act, the survivor still didn't meet the burden for murder. There was also a plea deal involved, I'm sure, that may have taken the murder charge off the table or something, cause I don't recall him actually having a trial or anything, just that he went to jail for 10 years. I was like 12 -14 when this played out.",

It doesn't have to be an accident.\n\nThe difference between voluntary and involuntary manslaughter is that voluntary means the homicide was intentional and occurred amid provocation. Crimes of passion, bar fights, and domestic disputes often fall under this category whereas involuntary manslaughter is when the defendant had no intention of killing anyone but did accidentally or inadvertently kill someone as a result of negligent, careless, or dangerous behavior, for example, accidentally firing a gun and killing someone would be an example of involuntary manslaughter.",

I am not saying it is not but let me clear up something. \n\nI have some experience with courtrooms (non American). In most cases somebody needs to be proven guilty BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT. And that is where the problem lays. This means it is not about what happened but what can be proven for shure. So sometimes even if everybody knows what happened the defence can give a plausible alternative. The person will go free for a heavier sentence because it was not beyond reasonable doubt /ea there was an plausible alternative explanation of the facts as presented. \n\nSo in this case it could be (this is speculation) that the judge deemed manslaughter, but not murder PROVEN. It does not mean it wasn\u2019t murder but the evidence was not legally sufficient to be convicted for this fact. \n\nIn addition sometimes an DA knows this in advance and will therefore not charge for the higher sentence. \nThis might seem confusing but has a good reason. If found innocent you often can\u2019t be re-charged for the same crime. So this leaves the door open to later additional and heavier charges. The system is far from perfect but it has its reasons why it is what it is. \n\nHope this helps.\n\nEdit for grammer etc",

If it's done correctly, the guilty are convicted and the innocent go free. Trouble is, it's not a perfect system, and there are those who are either too stuck on the belief that the person they have is the criminal, or they are too interested in what they can gain by putting someone away. It's another reason why we are supposed to treat all accused as innocent until proven guilty.",

They can't have any thoughts as to whether their client is innocent or not, or at least they shouldn't. You believe they are guilty? Then how are you going to convince the jury if you can't even convince yourself. You believe they are innocent? If they get sentenced with the guilty verdict that can do a number on your psyche. In the end they're job is to put across the defence as best as they can, and to the best of their ability convince the jury to vote either not guilty or not proven.",

And tell me not, he'd not ever seen this side of his witch before they married?\n\nNow, lets see someone the death penalty is wrong. In many \"civilized\" countries, it would alresdy be done except the talking about it. Of course, prison can be a be a pretty surprising place. Ive never been a guest, but i have. been on jobsites inside the walls a time or two. Especially NY, NJ, etc. On one occasion, being inside only once would have been enough.",

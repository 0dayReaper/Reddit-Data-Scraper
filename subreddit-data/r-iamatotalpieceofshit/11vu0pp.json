THey have to be put on admin leave until the investigation is complete. \n\nPolice unions are a big part of the reason why police are so shitty here in this country.   Don't get me wrong, I do believe in unions in general, just not police unions",

Their blanket policy is to appeal punishments always to represent their member in a more organized way, unless the worker explicitly decides not to appeal.\n\nIf the union is appealing they are arguing that the punishment is wrong. Oviously if there is a disagreement on whether the punishment is appropriate you don't punish the officer anyways while you are waiting to have it ultimately decided, but at the same time you don't let them continue to work. Hence the paid leave while the investigation continues. This is how workers rights works in every field with a good union (granted police unions are a little *too* good imo)",

The accountability is driven by the standards of the profession set  by the union.

The police union has failed itself and its members by lowering the bar of professional behavior.",

It probably needs to be a multi-pronged approach, because in a lot of cases to address the problems at the top, you need to move new people up. People who got to the top by doing things the wrong way aren't going to be able to change. In order to move new people up, you need to have people who are sufficiently trained at various levels of the department to be capable of being moved up, but also be the type of people that fit the new paradigm you wish to operate under.\n\nIf you only try addressing the top, you end up with problems, and if you only try addressing the bottom, you'll end up with problems. Not necessarily the same problems, but problems nonetheless. That's the challenge, because the multi-pronged approach is more difficult to achieve and more resource intensive in some ways.",

Tons of repetitive paperwork.  Dealing with annoyed people who are annoyed at you.  Dealing with drunks and the homeless and the mentally ill and the addicts.  And then once in a while getting into stressful potentially physical altercations where you could be shot, stabbed, spit on, bitten, etc.\n\nObviously I\u2019m exaggerating if I say *nobody* qualified to be a police officer would want to be a police officer, but you are scraping the bottom of the barrel of the workforce. And indeed curiosity, reasoning, and critical thinking skills are selected against during the hiring process to save the costs associated with training people who are going to hate the job and leave.",

But the unofficial reason obviously is so they can turn them off and do crimes and beatings etc",

My guess is he was let go once they got him back to the station.\n\nAbout a decade ago, a police inspector was coming home from a party and wrapped his car around a tree. There were eye witness reports of him swerving all over the road and speeding, just before the accident. Fortunately no one was seriously injured but reports were that the inspector was drunk. The cops didn't do a breathalyzer on site, or in the hospital. They claimed he didn't appear intoxicated. \n\nThe local DA got a warrant for his blood test taken at the hospital, which was done about an hour after the accident and it was .21. The legal limit in NY is .05. So he was over 4 times the legal limit. They ended up arresting him 3 weeks later, but the lawyer for the cop got the blood test thrown out as a violation of doctor-patient privilege. \n\nHe ended up pleading guilty to  driving while impaired and reckless endangerment. He got 3 years probation, a 30 days suspension, and lost $40,000 in termination pay. He retired a few months later with his $132,000 pension.",

He's already a sargeant, and the other one just rolled up as back up. Likely this isn't first time that this has happened with the captain and he probably burnt through any and all attempts within the department before this to cover things up. So it was the luck of the draw for the sarge. Plus, there is too much publicity, but he did turn his camera off once he was able. He did everything far more politely and respectfully than he would have with a civilian. His hands were tied. A few hard liners would privately want to hang him out to dry for it, but majority will recognize the situation as the captain messed up one too many times and it got out.",

One morning a car came speeding though the neighborhood, and when I yelled at her to stop as she was crossing the street, the car ended up hitting her in the snout.\n\nThe driver stopped, got out of his car, and offered to help. Ginger was pawing at her nose, then noticed him standing next to me.\n\nI told the guy to run! He offered again to help but I told him I could handle it as she chased him back to the car.\n\nAs bad as she felt atm, she was more concerned about my well being. Loved that dog to pieces and thankfully she recovered just fine.\n\nEdit: To whomever downvoted me for this comment, please tell me why?",

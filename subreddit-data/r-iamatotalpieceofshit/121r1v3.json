The camera protected her and her family because without I'm in sure they would have rushed into her home claiming an active emergency. The US seriously needs to make over its entire policing system. These uneducated bullies have ruined it. The police are supposed to be protectors of the community, someone to rely on. Instead people are scared of them and have to hope that cameras can protect them. I'm very confident that the agent would have planted something on the kids. It's just sad all around. Allegedly they targeted her kid because of her other son's run ins with the law according to a few articles I found on Google.",

Who knows, maybe they get handsy and get a chance to say they were scared for their life and had to defend themselves. It is shameful that often you have the same deranged bully\u2019s in school that become law. Even worse when they can pal up with someone like minded and roam streets like roaming hallways looking to give wedgies. Only now the wedgies has evolved into ruining/taking lives.",

A squad car of armed men with vests on pull up and start acting aggressively and demanding things and few people are even aware of who is talking to them much less what their rights may be. All of this is by design of course because they don't want people thinking clearly or asking for a lawyer.",

Im sure being a cop aint easy doing 12 hours under stress constantly. What could give the citizens relief on their end so were not causing crime? And what can be done inside the law enforcement community to give them the relief they need? Lifes tense and hard enough we cant love EVERYTHING lol but doing things like understanding if the problem should be worked up or relaxed, or knowing the time and place, being as mature as possible, and giving the person your talking to the upmost respect so they can show it back. Even when your talking and not getting respect back, be nicer. I promise it works. Its time to heal.",

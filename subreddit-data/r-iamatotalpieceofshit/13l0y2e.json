I know at some point the county had a bounty on foxes. You'd turn in a pair of ears to get paid.\n\nI look at my almost eight year old and think \"what the hell were they thinking?\" I can't trust her to not put her clothes on backwards.",

Kids tended to grow up faster when they had to work on the farm every day and there wasn't much in the way of entertainment beyond radio. Also our culture was just different. Children were a lot more respectful but also didn't ask questions or raise doubts - so some good some bad.",

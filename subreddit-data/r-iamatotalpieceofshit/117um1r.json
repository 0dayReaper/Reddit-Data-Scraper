Some people like this do just want to argue, but in my experience at least their own shitty inner self just felt compelled to express itself.

If you take what we call \u201cdistinct races\u201d and put them in on a kind of picture wheel, with every image being very similar to those next to it (close enough to be siblings) you can see that by changes almost too subtle to even notice, you can cross from white to sub Saharan African, to Asian, to Native American, and back in only 12 pictures. Meaning the differences between races are so extremely minor that the whole concept of there even being distinct races makes very little sense.\n\nWe look at a laughably tiny sample of information to determine race. It\u2019s literally a handful of characteristics that are defined by extremely minor genetic differences. If you consider that the same amount of variation can occur in ways not immediately visible (such as in the structure of your inner ear), you realize that we\u2019re like a race of nearly identical cars that are judging each other by the several microns of paint we are covered in. It really shows you that race, as a biological concept, is completely stupid.",

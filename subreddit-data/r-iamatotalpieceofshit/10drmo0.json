Of course the teacher didn't know it was a fake weapon and according to the law threatening with a fake weapon is the same as threatening with a real weapon.\n\nThe aftermath is that both teens were expelled and that's pretty much it. What a farce. The teacher will have to deal with the trauma for a while.",

I went through real lockdowns when I was in school and while they didn\u2019t happen often it was still a bit scary. At one point when I was in 6th grade I was using a wheelchair at school and for long outings as walking a lot caused me a great deal of pain from the benign tumors in my legs. I remember we had a lockdown drill when I was in my wheelchair and I didn\u2019t know what to do so I just stayed in my chair after going up to the front of the classroom. I was thinking about this recently and I realized that there was no plan in place for me if I were at school during a real lockdown. Why that never happened I can\u2019t tell you but I hope that the mistakes they made with me and the other physically disabled students were a learning experience for the teachers and administration.",

It raised national protest and both 16yo student landed in front of a judge and received sentences that included being banned from the d\u00e9partement (equiv of a county) with no right to set foot there again and of course they got expelled from that school. \n\nTried to find the final sentences but didn\u2019t find anything yet. It will be quite harsh I guess as this never happened before - but happened again after it as a copycat challenge in another city in France. Guns (real ones) in French schools are extremely rare - luckily.",

In France due to winds blowing eastwards from the seaside, historically factories were located on the eastern side of large cities to avoid smoke from chimneys going over residential areas. So the north east is usually ugly and the poorest area. \n\nThis is the case in the Paris area with the \u00b493\u2019 d\u00e9partement being the less nice area. The east and south east areas of the Parisian surroundings are just average suburbs with a few jewels in there that are really expensive areas. The south and north west are more expensive and the west in general is upper end. In general no matter where you go, the immediate outer ring of suburbs touching Paris are expensive with the south west being almost at the same prices than Paris. \n\nDon\u2019t forget that Paris itself  is really small and can be crossed on foot from north to south in less than 3hrs. The suburbs contain 4x Paris\u2019 population and driving out 20km gets you out of the entire city area. 30km out of Paris and you\u2019re in the absolute countryside. Paris is not LA\u2026",

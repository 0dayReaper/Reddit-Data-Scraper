Our first cat, Jasmine, loved being let outside and roll around on the deck and in the grass in the backyard. And we kind of let her explore, as we backed onto an area of greenbelt and walking/skiing trails behind the house. Until one day she didnt come back. Were in northern alberta, it's not strange to have wolves, foxes, sometimes black bears roaming the neighborhood behind the houses. We figure she must have gotten taken away by something bigger than her. I wasnt living at home at the time, I was at university, but even if I had been home, I would have let her out to roam.

I helped him fix his fence, and all seemed well. \n\nTwo more rabbits, we started over.

He had drank so much out of the bowl too. So seeing him finally puke was pure bliss in that moment. I then dried him up put him in bed and watched him like a hawk.

It goes without saying that poisoning people's pets is fucked up - but it's a choice to let your pet roam, and if they're killing your neighbor's trained birds that's a pretty big issue.",

I learned myself that cats apparently can't resist antifreeze. \n\nYears ago I was renting a garage from a friend in a suburban housing development so I could fix an old truck I owned. Whenever I was over there, a super friendly stray cat would come and hang out with me, we became buddies. \n\nWhen I was working on the water pump, I had to drain all the antifreeze into a shallow pan. The cat refused to stay away from the antifreeze pan, so I picked her up and carried her around to the neighbors trying to figure out who owned her so they could keep her inside temporarily. \n\nWhen I finally found the owner, she told me \"that cat was originally my daughters, but I am a single mom who works two jobs and my daughter has &lt;some afterschool thing&gt; so we can't care for her anymore. If you want her, I will pay for her to get spayed.\" \n\nAnd that's how I adopted a cat.\n\n(and the obligatory cat tax:  https://imgur.com/a/I1My49t  )",

Serious. \n\nThe treatment for ethylene glycol is Ethyl Alcohol. The idea is that if you put a bunch of ethanol in you it\u2019ll compete for the metabolites that make antifreeze into poisonous stuff. So it passes out of your body as ethylene glycol instead of what really poisons you, glycoaldehyde, glycolic acid, and glyoxylic acid.",

I live on a big farm, but last week an unknown animal came and killed the stray cats and some of its kittens that had made a home outside our place on the land. Now I see this.  I'm so glad my cats are safe inside.",

I simply tell em trap em and post a found poster around the neighborhood if someone claims the cat tell em they need to provide a litter box for there cat. If no one claims the cat call animal control and have em checked for a chip. Killing cats just because they poop in you flower bed is not gunna solve  your problems. So fucked up how people can just kill a cat.",

I would be so freaked out something like this would happen never mind mortified if my cat decided to just hang out on someone else's property ruining gardens, killing birds, and shiting in their yard.  Please just keep your pets inside a fenced in area or on a leash.",

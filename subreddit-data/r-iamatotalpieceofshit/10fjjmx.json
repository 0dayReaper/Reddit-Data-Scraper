Certain breeds ARE more dangerous than others, pit bulls, central Asian Shepards, mastiffs even borzois ect are all dangerous breeds. They were bred to fight and protect, which means their bite force is INCREDIBLE, and many of these dogs are also bred to bite and hold on. \nWhile I agree that it is usually the owners fault for not properly training their dogs, you do have to accept that some breeds do come with more possible dangers. \nPit bulls can be the sweetest dogs, big old babies, but they, like all animals, have the capability of harming someone, and the harm they can cause is a lot bigger than others. If you aren\u2019t willing to admit that, I\u2019m sorry but you shouldn\u2019t be an owner in my own opinion. \nA RAT can cause damage to a person, it\u2019s not rocket science to know that some animals are dangerous in the right conditions. \n(That being said, again, pits are AMAZING when properly trained and socialized. My best friend has a service pit who is the best dog I\u2019ve ever met! This pit is sadly not properly trained, and neither is the owner. The pit should atleast be on a leash so the lab has the proper chance to run away when uncomfortable)",

What this does is displace the breed and criminalize them in a similar way that people of color have been. Most pitbulls are owned by low income individuals or families bc you can pick them up at the pound by the dozen with ease and they're allowed to inhabit homes in these areas legally. The areas that pitbulls are owned in concentration are also statistically \"crime ridden\" for the exact same reason the bullies are statistically \"viscous\" It's not the breed. It's systemic issues ,both societal and legislative, perpetuating statistics that don't hold water. You can see the world however you'd like and continue to hold hatred but you're part of the problem.  Shepard's are more dangerous physically than pits and can be just as aggressive. It's not training or genetics, it's training AND genetics that makes a good dog. Humans go to therapy to fix behavioral issues and anti social behavior. We do the same for dogs but unfortunately the majority of dog owners are extremely careless and uneducated on the subject of training and rehabilitation. Statistically coconuts kill more people than sharks every year but which one are people more afraid of? I can't walk my dog in my own neighborhood bc my fool neighbors walk all their dogs off leash. No matter how \"good\" your dog is, it's negligent ownership to keep it off leash in a public area where it could get into an altercation. My pup is well behaved but she's no wimp, if a dog tests her she'll show them what for as she should and as all dogs do. However if my dog is leashed and then approached by an unleashed dog. It becomes not only a dangerous situation for the pups but also the owners that will attempt to separate them.",

From every single breed that is not in the bully breeds, the bully\u2019s still double the attack rate. This is those dogs. Period. A lot of dogs CAN be as dangerous, but the likelihood is where your little pitties take the cake. They are born with a high prey drive that goes into literal overdrive around the age of sexual maturity. 2-3 years. You can\u2019t train out genetics. That\u2019s a sweet thought. But that\u2019s all it is. \n\nThey need to be spayed and neutered out of existence. Every dog that has bites reported needs to be immediately euthanized. The moment a dog presents itself as a danger, behavioral euthanization needs to occur. That goes for any dog.

The lab probably isn't even aware of whats going on tbh.",

I would never do this and I would never condone this. She is putting that lab in danger, it makes me so angry omfg. I rescued my dog from an abandoned house, id never had a pit before (hes a pit/lab mix). I promise you, some of us owners completely understand the real danger and necessity of keeping our dogs in check. Sorry, this wasn't meant as a rant to you lol I swear, im going off my anger from the video tbh.",

It's super annoying after all the attacks that pit supporters are still in such denial. Every pit I've known has been lovey and nice but always a bit rambunctious and very strong.      It's not just bad owners that make bad dogs It's also breeds that were never intended to be cuddly home pets.",

To say that one breed is worse than another is ludicrous. BTW, a German Sheppard's bite is 238 psi, where a pitbull's is 235. I know it's not a big difference, but to say one dog breed is inherently more dangerous than another is just incorrect, no matter what way you look at it.\n\nPost thought edit: except Dalmatians disney fucked that whole breed up with incestuous forced breeding.

Because every dog is like a dalmation. Incestuous forced breeding is one of the key cornerstones to making a wild animal domesticated. Every breed that has ever has existed has went through selective forced breeding that in 100% of breeds had multiple lines of incest. Humankind has produced generation after generation of dogs through force breeding and incest to create something that they wanted. And for pitbulls what we wanted was an animal that does 3 things. Find something. Bite it. Never let go.\n\nPeople have tried to turn them into house pets now but the problem with that is no one is actually selectively breeding them in a way that makes it possible. You're anecdotal evidence of how sweet the pits you met were doesn't change the history, statistics, or science behind dog breeding.",

Sadly, many people find that's not true like my family did and like the family of those two children who were torn apart in front of their mother by the pitbulls that had been part of the family for 8 years.\n\nMany people may disagree with my stance that pitbulls should be banned from society and that's fine, but at the very least we should all agree that these dogs are not your standard family dogs, certainly not \"nanny dogs\" and should require special handlers that understand the dangers and keep them under control.",

I was in the gas station paying. \n\nThat being said, THOSE hillbillies were awful, but not all southerners. \n\nI know what you are going to say, those were people and these are dogs.   I was attacked by a German Sheppard when I was a child. Damn near ripped my finger off. \n\nI harbor no ill will towards them because I need evidence. You are assuming you know what is going on, just like PETA when they rip pets away from people then kill them saying it\u2019s for the best.",

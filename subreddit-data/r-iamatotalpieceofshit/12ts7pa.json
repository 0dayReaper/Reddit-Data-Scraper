If you consider the animal to be a deadly weapon, which it is, then it should be reasonable to tell the owner, if they don't remove the dog, they're getting shot. You were in fear for your life, and/or great bodily harm. Because you can guarantee that if the guy shot the dog, the owner would probably shoot him in retaliation.",

Fortunately I never used it, unfortunately I carried it due to the times I wished I had it. One piece of advice I can offer anyone who is being attacked by a dog, if you have the ability to kill it, do it. Do not be worried about hurting the dog or upsetting the owner. Do not try to find a nonlethal way to end the attack. Any dog attacking people without the right cause should be put down anyways. It\u2019s ok to own those dogs, but owning a dangerous dog means accepting the responsibility.",

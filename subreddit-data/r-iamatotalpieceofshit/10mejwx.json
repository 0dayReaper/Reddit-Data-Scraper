I've been homeless before and had to walk around in the cold with blankets because I didn't have proper clothes to keep me warm. Other than that, she most likely stole the shoes to keep her feet warm. It's unfortunate but this is a common problem in our world now.",

Once we quit the drugs it was entirely too difficult to find a decent paying job to pay rent in Florida, so we were gifted tickets to New Mexico. We had been clean for 14mos when we moved and I had saved up enough money to pay for a hotel for a week and once there I immediately started working as this area was desperate for workers of all types. From there I saved enough and with state housing assistance rented our apartment after 6mos. Now, 4yrs later, we own our own home, I have my own business and my wife is assistant Manager at a large pharmacy/store. My background is in business mngmt and marketing and drugs caused me to lose everything. Since getting clean, I've gotten my life back together and on track. Also, at the time of leaving Florida my wife was 6mos pregnant with our now beautiful 4yr old son!\n\nHomelessness is can be cause by a multitude of things and not every homeless person is a \"crackhead\", they are mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, etc and their lives have become extraordinarily difficult so please treat them like humans because they are still humans like you and me.",

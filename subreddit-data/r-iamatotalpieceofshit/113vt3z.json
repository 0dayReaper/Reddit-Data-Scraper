I worked at an assisted living facility for people with paranoid schizophrenia, and there were a lot of people, who were totally aware that their thoughts were irrational, and knew that their visual and auditory hallucinations were imaginary, but when you are repeatedly hearing *\"everyone is watching you\"* from both visible and invisible sources, you are still prone to delusional paranoid thoughts, despite knowing what's happening to you.",

From the article:\n\u201cClancy began January 24 by taking her daughter Cora to a doctor's appointment, and the medical office's staff reported that she was acting normally, state attorneys said.\nShe then returned home where she played in the snow with Cora and Dawson. The three built a snowman and sent photos of it to family, prosecutors say.\nThe mother also looked up a restaurant 11 minutes away to order takeout and asked her husband Patrick, who was working from home, to leave and pick up the food. \nThis errand could have been made \"in an effort to lure him away for a longer period of time so that she had more time to commit these murders,\" Levin claims.\nThroughout the day, Clancy also had phone conversations with doctors and her husband, which both parties have recalled to be relatively normal.\nAccording to Levin, prosecutors could claim that \"she was thinking clearly, speaking clear and was of calm, cool, and collected mind,\" while arguing against the mom.\n\"The prosecution is going to have to prove that even if she was mentally ill, she still knew that what she was doing was wrong or illegal,\" Levin claimed\u201d",

She was being treated for PPD and on meds for it, but meds affect everyone differently so who knows.  It's not very often that the insanity plea works for people, regardless if they really are insane.    I feel bad for the husband to come home to this tragedy and for what those poor babies went through.  It's truly hard to understand something like this.  I know ppl who have had PPD and couldn't get out of bed, who have tried suicide and that person was taking zoloft for it.  From all accounts she was a loving and attentive mother.  There really is a mental health crisis.  Kids though are so completely innocent,  especially at this age, that it's hard to get past their senseless murders whether someone is sane or not.  I can't begin to imagine how horrible a good mother would feel coming back to their true self after having a psychotic break and murdering their children.  It's truly the unthinkable.   I will let the doctors decide what happened,  because from all reports, she was a loving mom and I've seen the affects of PPD.  Not to this extreme, but this unfortunately wouldn't be the first time this has happened and it was a true psychotic break.  Her googling the drive time threw me as well.  I would like to know what her doctor's prescribed her for her PPD and what those possible side affects are, especially the rare ones...psychotic episodes???   Zoloft has a \"thoughts of suicide\" warning and that is what my ex SIL was prescribed when she tried to kill herself with PPD.  My niece was under a year, maybe 6 months old at the time.  Those rare side effects are rare but they DO happen.  So will want to see what comes out in trial",

Thus you can't go to a jail or prison. If you have a case where what you said happened, I would be glad to receive that link. Otherwise, I believe you're wrong about that",

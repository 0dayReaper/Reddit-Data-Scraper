Now as an employee I would inquire if I saw no obvious tags.  When we would get busy all those handicapped spots were filled and at any given time I'd pretty much guarantee half the handicapped spots were occupied by people that weren't handicapped.  So now anyone that comes that is handicapped is going to have to park in the boondocks.  In general those inquiries were to ensure handicapped spaces were available to handicapped people.\n\nPeople are selfish and entitled and their ethical compass degrades with how filled up the parking lot is.\n\nWith that said, I will say the \"general public\" shouldn't be enforcing the rules.  They dont work there, they aren't a member of law enforcement.  They should mind their own business.",

I've been told to \"Just drop him off and park elsewhere\" and other similar BS.

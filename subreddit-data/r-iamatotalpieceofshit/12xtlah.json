Which means Fox News got rid of him, it hurts Fox because he is there a cash cow. They lost $1 million right after they fired him if my memory serves me right. Other than Greg Gutfeld, (and to a small extent, Jesse Waters and Brian Kilmeade) the only reason people watch Fox News is because of Tucker Carlson.\n\nAnd the reason why they fired him is because one of the Murdock was uncomfortable with his findings about what really happened in January 6 protests, even though Tucker got more than a million views from his analysis of Jan 6 protests.\n\nThat\u2019s more than CNN and MSNBC put together.",

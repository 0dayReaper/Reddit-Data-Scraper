There has got to be more deserving criminals that can be paroled before those dirtbags get their chance.  \n\nCalifornia wanted to release a guy named Michael Cheek who was classified as a \u201cSexually Violent Predator\u201d and place him in a home in a very rural small community (20 minutes away from town) on a street next door to a teenage girl and other young children.  He would be monitored with an ankle bracelet.  There are no stores or police stations nearby except for two volunteer fire stations.  If the power would go out from a tree hitting wires, it would be the rapist\u2019s responsibility to start a generator to keep home monitoring system working.  Taxpayers would foot the $6,500 per month rent for him.  This guy used a weapon to kidnap and assault a teenager and also attacked a woman.  He had no connection to the area besides that he committed one of his rapes there.  The judge actually placed him there but people raised hell.  The judge then needed more time to look over the details to make a second decision.  Community members then gathered and designed a children\u2019s playground next to the home in an effort to try to keep him out.  It eventually worked.",

I feel like it is up there with \"street justice\", a.k.a. folklore loosely associated with an occasional shanking due to the quality of the subject's associations.  i.e. would their odds of being raped or shanked be any different from any other prisoner?  Would their offence be widely known, and if so, would it just be an excuse to pick a fight with them vs some moral action?\n\nSuffice it to say I'm not picturing much honor amongst thieves, and I don't imagine \"the good ones\" to throw what's left of themselves away to go Charles Bronson.",

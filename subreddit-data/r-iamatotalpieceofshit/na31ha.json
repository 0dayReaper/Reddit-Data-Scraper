Thankfully cruelty laws are being passed more widely but you ever see an Amish dude kicking their horse or hitting it with like, a wrench? All that Amish person sees is themself banging one tool on another. And the law will see it this way too in most places today.",

I don't see Newsom getting that low, a primary challenge would be a larger threat to him holding office. In state-wide offices, Republicans can essentially no longer win in CA, they barely even try lately. Even if we got a celebrity-popular Schwarzenegger-esque moderate Republican in the general (which was the only time in the last three decades the CA GOP held the governorship), they'd likely fail to reach that crucial 50% mark.",

In fact both black bears and brown bears (grizzlys) can appear black, brown, blonde, or even in combination.\n\nThis is why color is a poor way to identify bears in the wild. Grizzlies have a pronounced shoulder hump, dish shaped face, and shorter rounded ears. This bear in the pic has all three of those characteristics\n\nAlso, the hot asphalt is probably bad for its paws, but an 80 degree temp outside wouldn't be too much of a problem. Grizzlies live in places where temps can get much higher than that during summer",

Destroy them all.  Movies that use abused animals?  Nope.\n\nBut zoos, say, doing a cheetah run?  That\u2019s enrichment for the animal, and has as much benefit for the animal as it does the human watching the cheetah run.  It\u2019s getting to do what it would do in the wild.  But forcing the animal to perform is a no go for me.  I know the Columbus Zoo for example won\u2019t go on with a performance if the animal isn\u2019t digging it that day, which is the way it should be done.  \n\nAs for SeaWorld, I think Jane Goodall said it best, \u201cthere are various ethical issues.  First, there are zoos that should not be.  Secondly, there are certain animals that should never be in a zoo.\u201d  I think that speaks to my feelings on the matter there.  She does go on to say though, \u201cbut at the same time, I completely dislike an organization being discredited when it\u2019s doing the right thing, or really trying to do the right thing.  And very often by working with an organization that\u2019s trying to do the right thing we\u2019ll do it even better.\u201d  So please, don\u2019t throw every single zoo out with the likes of SeaWorld.  Just the zoos that are like SeaWorld.",

The only particle that can be absorbed in vape juices is the nicotine, Vegetable glycerin and propylene glycol simply can\u2019t be absorbed through the Lungs. Now many people who do end up with major issues are purchasing through an unregulated market. Minors who have to go through smoke shops that don\u2019t care about their customers. I don\u2019t believe using either is a healthy choice, but comparing the ingredients in regulated vape juices compared to everything put into cigarettes and the byproducts of burning it, the choice is clear which is a better option.",

Also we don't know what chemicals the flavors are made of and how much if any metal is inhaled during normal use. I used to vape and rationalized it the same way because I was addicted, but once I quit I totally understand now that it could very well be worse than smoking. We just don't have any idea because it's so new, it could be almost harmless or it could be so much worse than smoking. Not a risk I'm willing to take.",

If you are running it hot enough and hitting it enough after it goes empty to start melting plastic and burning Cotton then it\u2019s being misused and error. Yes I\u2019m aware it\u2019s new, the addictiveness comes from the ease of use and practicality compared to having to smoke a cig in an open space. I used vaping for a while to get off of using chewing tobacco, quit vaping about a year ago and started using zyn nicotine pouches and am slowly working off of nicotine as a whole. Only time will tell if it\u2019s really healthier but for now the best option is to keep people options open and let them choose for themselves. But banning the sale of flavored vapes will only profit the unregulated market. Using cheap ingredients for insane markups and not giving two shits about what happens because people will still buy them. I\u2019ve recognized that it\u2019s an unhealthy choice and that is what is motivating me to cut nicotine out as a whole.",

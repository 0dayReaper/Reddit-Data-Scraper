Not sure if it's taxable at the state level though, but I would wager it isn't in Colorado. \n\nAttorney's fees (especially contingencies) are a much more likely source of leeching on this award. I can't comment to that, though. \n\nBut, to your original point, no - the US Federal government did not tax him on this award.",

Traumatic events cause gaps in memory, and those gaps get filled in as you're re-telling the story. The witness usually doesn't even know that what they're recalling never actually happened, even though in some cases they can recall things that (whether or not they know it) are literally impossible.\n\nIn extreme examples, those gaps can last long enough to forget the entire event. This actually happened to me in an ATV accident. I remember what happened just before the accident, and what happened just after it, but I have no memory of the accident itself. In these cases it's easier to realize that you don't actually know what happened, and I suspect that's what happened here. The fact that she knew she was guessing probably means that she never formed a memory of the rapist's face. In these cases you're supposed to tell the witness to only describe what they know for sure, and not speculate. By sending her home to think it over, and accepting the evidence she came back with, they encouraged speculation.\n\nThese cops should have known better. And the worst part is that they probably did.",

It's on amazon prime.  It's about a kid who goes missing.  Everyone assumes he's been murdered and a man gets sentenced to 30 years for his murder.  The police threatened him with the death penalty if he didn't confess, but said he could get 30 years if he did confess.  He didn't commit the crime but confessed to save his life.  After he'd been in prison for 10 years, the \"murdered\" kid turns up alive.  It's a really good show.",

His office was sued so many times for Brady violations (not turning over exculpatory evidence to the defense). One case in particular went up to the Supreme Court, where a Thomas majority opinion basically said it was fine because it was the first time they hid *blood* evidence, which was *totally* different than hiding other types of evidence. That was the civil case against Connick; thankfully when the hidden blood evidence was revealed, he was granted a new criminal trial and found not guilty, but he had spent years on death row.",

The woman identified her rapist who then confessed, and this innocent man went to jail anyway. The implication that she or her dream had anything to do with his conviction is insane.

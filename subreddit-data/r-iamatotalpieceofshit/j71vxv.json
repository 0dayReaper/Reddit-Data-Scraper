I've dealt with vehicle breakdowns (personal delivery vehicle) with thousands in repairs, I've dealt with needing to get 4 boxholders out on a Saturday, and I have broken down and cried a few times. But I would never think about doing something like this, the Postal Inspection Service scares me more than my suicidal anxiety. \n\nI know it'll get better when I have my own route. Hell, when I go back to do my old hold down, it's like muscle memory casing stuff. Any other route I'm lost on and it takes forever. But meh, despite the stress, I'd never dream of dumping a DPS tray.",

It requires websites to build a alternative version of their website with smaller HTML code and limited CSS of 50kB. AMP is based on asynchronic JavaScripts and websites sre hosted on a proxy server of Googles CDN (Content Delivery Network).\nIt basically cuts down the loading times on mobile by slimming down the HTML code and JacaScript.\n\nThe downsides is due to slimming down of HTML and Java, individuel design is difficult to achive and the bigger problem is that those chached AMP websites are hosted on Google server.\n\n(Source, translated from: https://www.webneo.de/blog/google-amp-teil-1/)",

The complaint went into my file and everything, where it sat for a specified amount of time, and was shredded.\n\nRegrets?  I have a few.  But not for that.",

I live in TX, and there are lots of drivers with fragile egos that simply cannot handle another vehicle passing them. Luckily, the only time I ever had to be rushed to the hospital with hazards on, about half of drivers pulled on the shoulder for us. I think about that comment a lot and how unavoidable that boys death was if drivers would have just let them go. Always pull over to let drivers with hazards pass-the same that you would do with police/EMS/fire. Someone's life could be at stake.",

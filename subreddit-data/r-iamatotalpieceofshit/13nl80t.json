I've started being overly cautious with protecting my hearing after I realized my hearing range (hz) is way smaller than it is for other people my age. \n\nI pretty rarely (maybe once or twice a month) have tinnitus where one ear first goes silent and then a ringing sound fades in and after a bit fades out and hearing is back to normal. And a constant ringing when completely quiet, I can make that go away for a while if I want though",

Why should it bother you if a highly trained dog is allowed to be in public, you aren't interacting with it and the dog doesn't pay attention to you. I get not everyone likes dogs but you dont have to, just ignore tgem like they ignore you. \n\nIt's nice to say that we should develop alternatives but dogs are autonomous and have special skill sets like incredible scent so they are really hard to replace. That kind of tech is decades away.\nI do agree that fake service animals get away far too often however, that makes me quite angry so I'm all for licking them out.",

We walk a thin line here with the reddit admins with the comments we can allow on posts and we are required to keep things civil in order to keep the subreddit open. Since we like this subreddit we're going to do what is necessary to keep it from being banned by reddit. \n\nFor the time being we are automatically locking the comments of every new submission until mods, who are volunteers with lives outside of reddit, can review the content posted. When or if we unlock the comments of a post please note that we will ban you if break any of our rules. **Be especially mindful of the following**:\n\n**Rule 1: Do not post or ask for identifying information, including first and last names and social media usernames.** Even if you feel the person is a public figure. We remove all external links you post to prevent you from accidentally posting identifying information.\n\n**Rule 2: Do not post violent comments, and do not glorify violence, per TOS.** We can't take responsibility for how angry a post makes you, you need to do that. Telling us \"it was a joke bro\" is not an excuse.\n\n**Rule 7: Do not link to or post screenshots of reddit posts, reddit comments, reddit personal messages, reddit profiles, etc.** We cannot allow you to use this subreddit to harass other people on reddit. If someone said something terrible report it to the subreddit where you found it or to the admins. We can't do anything about it. We don't care if you removed their username. Please don't post it here. \n\n**Rule 8: No bigotry, no racism or race baiting.** It is hard to believe that we even need a rule like this. But people make posts specifically to set up a honeypot of racist comments and they draw the worst people reddit allows to create an account. We do not like to remove posts about bad people doing bad things since that's the theme of this place. We do not have to allow you to be a total piece of shit in the comment section. \n\n**Our rules are zero tolerance. You will be banned for breaking them.**\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/iamatotalpieceofshit) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

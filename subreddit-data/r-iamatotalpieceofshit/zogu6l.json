All three of these criteria HAVE to be met before shooting. My man only had ONE, the fact he had an axe. He was not threatening the officer, or even was able to harm him from that distance. Sure you can say he could have thrown the axe, but he was just standing there and got shot in the fucking head",

Although this in itself shouldn't warrant such a reaction, his past criminal record would probably not have helped. Mahan has been charged with armed robbery, car-jacking and felon on possession of a fire arm. He had been in jail for some of the offences. This could explain way the cop is on edge. But the distance the cop was from mahan still makes it, in my opinion, an unjusitifed shooting. As there was tall grass in the way, impearing his movement if mahan was ever to run as the cop, and mahan was not at a distance where the axe could be used as a weapon. It is also reported that the cop is still working, although was put on leave for a couple days. He is keeping his identity confidential due to a law in Florida which allows it. Hope this clears things up.",

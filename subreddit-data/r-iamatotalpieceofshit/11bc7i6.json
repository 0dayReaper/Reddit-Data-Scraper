They should have put the effort in, but they didn't, and then everyone else has to suffer!\nI stay clear when I see people struggling to walk their dogs, because you don't know what could happen, and I don't want to hear, \"Tiny is never like that! Honestly, this is the first time he's ever acted like this!\".. Bullshit. Train your dog for everyone's safety and theirs.",

If I estimate that your animal is around a third of your weight, then I assume that, under duress, you won't be capable or willing to do what's needed to control it. I've unfortunately had to handle plenty of fractious animals in my day. If a dog wants to get you, it'll do so like it's life or death, they aren't so far removed from wild anxiety to regulate that. If anyone considers owning any animal and they don't consider themselves willing or able to match that intensity, then no matter how docile it is today, you aren't fit to care for it at it's worst. Only a human has the capacity to humbly admit that, that's our responsibility.",

It usually happens bc she discards toys and turns aggressive during play or when bringing her inside. She usually tries to pull on our wrists and hands, especially if outside on a leash to make us drop it. She will also sometimes jump and pull when excited like when I first come over after being gone a while. Telling her no prompts barking, growling, and more aggressive biting lunges to the point we have to shove her away. I\u2019m starting to get scared of her ngl but she\u2019s not my dog so I can\u2019t do much.)",

You don\u2019t spray at the animal, just use it to make the noise.

Yes, the dog is large and could cause damage but for the most part he seemed just curious, not mean. But, SHE broke the rules by bringing a large dog to a small dog park then was far more interested in winning her argument than ending the situation.  Unfortunately for the dog, it's the dog that'll have to pay the consequences for HER bad behavior!   She's far more aggressive than the dog is!  And when you add stupidity and her need to win the argument at all costs, it'll result in consequences for the dog.  Poor guy needs an owner that cares about him, not just winning arguments.",

One of my dogs is reactivate and while he doesn't jump up or anything and isn't remotely aggressive I'd never put him in this situation surrounded by strange, loud dogs because it clearly isn't safe.

Just got back from the vet cause my dog got a fox tail in his paw and it migrated up his leg. He almost lost his leg. He had a massive hole on top of his paw and below his knee, you could see the fat layer, and muscles and all that. We were going in 2-3 times a week so they could clean it, reapply antibiotic gel to it, etc. \n\nWell we were outside eating and I bought him a burger. \nWe go to leave, he's limping, leg in a bandage like 3 inches thick so he can barely walk, and some peoples dog at a further table runs up. My dog does as he's trained and moves behind me. Their dog runs behind me and grabs him on his neck, behind his Cone-Of-Shame.\n\nHe screams I let go of his leash and grabbed their dog by the neck and started punching the back of his head. I had 4 or 5 solid hits before it let go. Moment it let go I stopped punching and held him down on the asphalt until his owners finally ran up.  My dog had run to my car and ran to the passenger door yelping. \n\nFirst thing the dogs owners said was calling me every curse word in the book for punching their dog. People who didn't see their dog attack mine started screaming at me. The manager called the cops because It became this huge fucking ordeal. Only like 2 people saw this dog attack mine. But a bunch of people all saw me punching a dog. People inside, in the parking lot, drive thru, etc. I had a group of douchey frat boys getting in my face trying to fight me. Women calling me names, old dudes cussing me out. Bla bla bla. \n\nCops show up and like a dozen people all give witness that I was punching a dog. Owners wanting to press charges, etc. And because my dog didn't have any bite marks(because I got on theirs super fast he didn't have time to leave any damage)the cops were basically telling me I was at fault and risked arrest for animal abuse. Finally they decided to check the cameras and you see it clear as day their dog run up and yank mine to the ground. \n\nEverything did a 180. Cops asked me if I wanted to press charges, or anything. All I asked for was a copy of the police report because I was taking my dog right back to the vet. And if he had any damage I wanted the report so I could press charges against them. They gave the number to me and we left. Thankfully my boy was Okay But he was clearly traumatized by the whole thing. He already had a bad day at the vet, got bit and then saw me getting screamed at by probably 12+ people for almost an hour from the passenger seat of my car.",

My professor in particular has stated that teaching the Intro to Music Ed class feels more like teaching high school upperclassmen than collegiate freshmen because of it. It's just gonna pass through the populace of children too, so it'll become less pronounced as time goes on until it fades from the school system in the 2030s",

Unruly dogs get brought into our dog park about once every month and I\u2019m always flabbergasted the owners take the chance and let their dog run wild and start fights with other dogs when they should know how they behave. A dog owner is 100% responsible for the safety of their dog and others around jt, and also to socialize and train their dog properly to act properly in groups. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t stop some random idiot owner from prancing their aggressive, under-attended, pitbull lab mix right into the park with other dogs and acting \u201call surprised\u201d when it starts trying to dominate and bite other dogs there. The worst part is the owners\u2019 reactions half the time this happens, just lazily calling to their dog \u201cMilo, no. No, milo, stop it. Stop it\u201d and not even making an attempt to corral their animal. Watching how an owner engages with their dog and how their dog engages with other dogs usually fit like a puzzle.",

I told her to tie him up and we left. When we get back the dog is at my gate untethered and he toppled all of my patio furniture and broke the umbrella. She felt it wasn\u2019t her fault and didn\u2019t offer to give us money for it or to replace it. \n\nA couple of months later she invited me to a state park for her birthday. A friend rode with me and I was telling her about my issues with the dog and owner. We park and I open the door and the dog jumps on me. He had his leash on but she was letting him run freely so I was already irritated. We found a picnic spot and she tied the dog to picnic table and got into her kayak to go on the water while I laid in my hammock. About 50 yards away was the trail and a couple was walking their dog and her dog took off after it and broke the tether. Her dog was attacking this controlled dog and they were yelling, I wasn\u2019t getting in the middle of this interaction because I wasn\u2019t trying to get bit. My friend gets to land and gets off the kayak and just kept slapping her knees calling for him. This couple is rightfully flipping out and yelling at her. She finally moseys up to get her dog saying \u201cit\u2019s not my fault his tether broke.\u201d She comes back with her dog and in the nicest \u201cgood boy\u201d voice she tells him how bad he was and gave him some pets. We left and that was the final straw for me with her and this damn dog. She has no sense of responsibility and her untrained dogs actions are everyone else\u2019s fault. Why are these people the victims???",

They think they need to meet as many people and dogs as possible when that's not the case. Some dogs just Love all other dogs, but most dogs are more dog selective and rather than liking Every dog they meet they generally are more picky about true friendships. So sitting, watching, and training Outside of the dog park is better. Teachinhg a dog neutrality to being around other dogs, not them seeing another dog and immediate wanting to play with it. Setting up play dates or walks with trusted dogs that you know, that's also a better idea than dog parks. It's more about the experiences being good ones, than it is how many of them they've had.",

            "comment": "I had a similar experience, only in reverse. I had an extremely gentle Great Dane who my daughter and I used to take to the dog park all the time. He would actually hang out with the humas while we talked, then pounce over to the dogs whenever they would start to get in to fights. Break them up then come back.\n\nOne day, this lady brought an overly aggressive little dog into the big dog area. This dog was nipping at , barking at, and biting the  other dogs. It was bad and they were obviously bothered. As was my dog, who kept running over to it. The last time, the dog jumped up and bit at his face. He kept looking down at it. The dog did it again. At the 3rd time, my dog caught it in his mouth. He didn't squeeze, just held the dog there as if to tell him that he could kill him if he wanted to. This lasted about 5 or 6 seconds and he released the dog. NO blood, no harm. But the dog was finally taught a lesson.\n\nFINALLY the little dog's owner is present. She comes screaming over, pushing everyone out of her way. Threatening to sue me. Luckily I had about a dozen witnesses and nothing came from it.",

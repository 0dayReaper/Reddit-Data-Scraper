The city or state  can place a civil lien against your vehicle registration  so when you try to renew your registration, the penalty can catch up to you there.  there are several civil remedies available to them.   About 5-6 years ago  my step son got a speeding ticket in Iowa via a traffic camera.  Well being the registered owner  I got the bill for the fine.  My step son was a Senior  in HS at the time , so he wrote the check for the bill it was about $130 total. Anyway  it was his stupid tax and a learning event.  he never got another speeding ticket  since.",

My mom would drive me and my brother to the end of the driveway and we\u2019d wait in the car until the bus came. Well, one morning we hopped out for the bus. My brother was stepping onto the bus and I was about 20 feet behind him when suddenly this car came screeching in at me. The driver obviously hadn\u2019t been paying attention when the bus pulled over to the shoulder to pick us up, and instead of stopping in their lane they also pulled onto the shoulder to brake, then couldn\u2019t stop in time to avoid hitting the back end of the bus and headed right for me. They stopped about four feet shy of me. \n\nMy mom, brother, and a bus full of kids almost had to see me get killed by a car because some idiot wasn\u2019t paying attention. \n\nOf course they peeled out as soon as I recovered from my shock enough to get on the bus, and nothing ever came of it except that my mom drove me and my brother to school from then on.",

I know the bus is rolling to a stop but I have a feeling someone smart enough could figure the math though, no?\n\nEdit: Looks to be a Thomas Built bus, I could be completely wrong but google says they're about 37ft long. The second camera angle shows the guy clear the bus in a little under .6 of a second which comes out to 61 ft/s or 41.5 mph. The bus is also rolling to a stop so I know my number isn't quite accurate but still, too fast. \n\nWhat a dick.",

In almost every state in the US (possibly every state, not certain) when a school bus stops *all* traffic in *both* directions is supposed to stop in order to reduce the risk of children running out into the road and getting killed.\n\nThe bus is in the way because it's supposed to be in the way, basically.\n\nEDIT: Also sorry you're getting downvotes for asking a question. Sometimes you don't know until you ask.",

Safe for everyone and I don't want to risk hitting a kid getting on or off a bus . If there no option then drive normal or slower speed till the bus isn't anywhere near me . Edit I support bus have side camera that can save recording for police to issue tickets to unsafe drivers.",

Luckily, she didn't die and the driver who hit her apparently claimed that the sun was in his eyes and he couldn't even see the bus. I wasn't there when it happened, so I can't confirm whether it was true or not.\n\nSo I can't imagine willingly risking people's lives while they're trying to cross the street, especially kids, all because your small, fragile dick convinced you that you are the king of the road and the rules don't apply to you.",

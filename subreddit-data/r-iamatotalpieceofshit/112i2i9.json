I get the impression that had he hit the kid back the larger guy would have jumped on him. I'd rather get slapped a few times by someone too weak to even bruise my skin than the get stomped out",

Yes bullies are cowards but so are most people which is why it's never hard for someone to round up a posse to stomp out someone they don't even know. Again, kids should be taught to stand up for themselves but they should also know when to run, get help and when to take a couple of slaps to the face or a few dirty names.",

Most kids at this age are pushing boundaries, the bullies think they can get away with it so they push it further until they goto jail or something really bad happens. The kid getting picked on whether he decides to fight or run away there's nothing wrong with that, but what the kid must do after that is talk to someone. Usually these bullies gang up on the loner kids and that's really the root of the problem. If this kid had an older brother that cared or a group of friends that cared he would not be picked on at all. So the real issue is how this kid integrate himself so that he talks about being bullied and getting help. I hope he talks about it to someone who cares and that can make a difference and not suffer in silence and alone. The real tragedy is not the beating or the bullying but the suffering in silence alone.",

The reality is that when a few people start randomly kicking and punching it only takes one lucky blow to the wrong place to get seriously hurt. When I was young my mom taught in a rougher school than we went to. Think gang problems, weapons...while getting stomped out one kid got kicked in the throat and almost died. As an adult I saw a guy get into an argument with three other guys that escalated because nobody was willing to walk away. The guy who was alone ended up in a coma and the others went to jail.\n\nSo while I agree that the kid should talk to someone and perhaps make a friend group, not fighting back seems like the best care here.",

Pleasant, was arrested and charged Monday with two counts of stalking a minor, two counts of using a computer to commit a crime, and one count of obstruction of justice, The Morning Sun reported.\n\nWhen confronted with evidence against her, Licari reportedly made a full confession.\u00a0\n\nShe was released on $5,000 bond following her arraignment Monday. While she has not divulged the motive for her actions, she is due back in court on Dec. 29 to determine if there is sufficient evidence to proceed with a trial.\n\nUsing a computer to commit a crime carries a possible 10-year sentence, while stalking a minor and obstructions of justice carry five-year penalties.\"",

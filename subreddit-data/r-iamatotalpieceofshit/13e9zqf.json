I hadn\u2019t made it any different from the other drinks I had made that day. I think she was doing it on purpose, but I was 16 at the time, kinda shy, and felt obligated to do it, and I believe the shift lead was too busy for me to consult her too. I\u2019m sure this customer would have been filming that encounter if iPhones existed back then, she was making such a loud and big deal about it, almost seemed like a joke, and she seemed around my age if not a little older.",

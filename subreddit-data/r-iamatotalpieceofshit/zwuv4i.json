They just mean you don\u2019t pay for bail or post bonds, you just get assessed based on risk of serious harm, risk of harm to yourself, the public, known adults etc. If they think you are a danger to yourself or others or likely to run away then they will not release you on bail, alternatively they may release you on conditional bail meaning you have to be at a certain place at a certain time or avoid a certain place or person, or maybe get electronically tagged etc. \n\nThe idea that bail reform and ending cash bail means you just release dangerous and disturbed people onto the street is fear-mongering nonsense, it just means your financial situation does not impact the possibility of being granted bail (and it\u2019s a lot better than people being in jail for months or potentially years while they await trial because they can\u2019t afford the bond, you are innocent until proven guilty)",

I have seen both very good people who maintained their morals on them, and I have seen unscrupulous people continue to be so. Never have I noticed a propensity for violence that was not already there - even if it is there, opioids are not conducive to violence. I think he did this out of sheer mean heartedness. Not a damn thing else. Drugs are not an excuse, nor are they to blame, though they should be regulated. \n\nDo not take this to mean that I have any respect for the governor. Just that a lot of people instinctively jump to the opposite extreme. I used to be judgmental as a young man in high school around age 16 - your religion, your dress and chosen appearance, your music taste, what you imbibed, your politics.... but by 19, I had realized you can't nail a person down for anything like that, as I had encountered people who blew my expectations outta the water repeatedly. \n\nOf course one can make some generalizations, but this guy looked like trouble, and the cities are the worst. I have found in non-big-cities, there is a significant population of more normal homeless folks, mainly smoking weed and drinking beer, avoidant of harder drugs. They are obvious, and helped me out when I was lost across state.",

Some were once \"hard working Americans\" and lost everything due to bad luck.\n\nNot every homeless person is a violent drug addict. \n\nHomeless people deserve the same rights and dignity than those \"hard working Americans\" you were talking about.",

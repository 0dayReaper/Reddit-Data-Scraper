Certain things just will never be perfectly in order. Don\u2019t try to pet a dog that isn\u2019t receptive to it. A good owner can\u2019t always 100% account for the emotional state of another living creature, but they will have the dog secured so that you are in no danger so long as you afford them the same amount of space you would any other stranger that wasn\u2019t looking to specifically interact with you",

The dog lunged at the obnoxious twat without owner command and she was forced to struggle the dog away.\n\nThese dogs are not well trained and are a danger. Period.\n\nImagine - *and it shouldn't be very difficult* - that the twat was actually an obnoxious 8 year old screaming nonsense. And suppose the child passed by these dogs on a public sidewalk. \n\nA dog lunging without command - for any reason - is a threat to the community and a disgrace on the owners.",

She never attacked anyone, but she was willing to guard me with her life. (I had some tension with a guy I work with so when we had a meeting, she sat between us instead of at my side. No aggression, just don't try anything body language)",

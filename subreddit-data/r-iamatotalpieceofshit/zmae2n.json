They said that sometimes the drivers pull up to the wrong house accidentally, and there\u2019s something about their scanner that tells them what house they\u2019re at when they scan the package. So most of these videos just show Amazon drivers at the wrong house, where they don\u2019t realise it until they\u2019ve scanned the package. Then they gotta grab the package back and deliver it to the right house. It makes a lot more sense than to assume that these drivers are gonna risk it all for what could potentially be a pair of socks.",

I mean there were people who didn't believe he was the son of god, and they wrote about him, but not from a stance of admiring him.\n\nBut the miracles and crazy-ass stories of the bible (Daniel and the lions' den, perhaps?)(or the story of Moses?)(orrrr, Noah'a ark?) Like, this is super crazy. Stuff that comes from a dream you had while suffering from the flu. None of it makes sense. And it can't be proven, hence \"faith\".\n\nSo, it's probable that Jesus was a real guy. He just probably wasn't anything special. Just some regular dude who liked carpentry.\n\nEDIT: I actually forgot the video on this post, cause I got lost in the comments. I just wanna add that that guy is a twat. He needs to mind his own business. What a jerk.",

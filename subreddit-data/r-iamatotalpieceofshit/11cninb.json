They had to make a right and the car in front wouldn't move and was waiting. They blared the horn and nothing, one of the guys got out of the truck and knocked on the drivers window and they just looked forward and didn't acknowledge anything. \n\nLong story short after multiple radio calls about there issue my dad got a call from his cop buddy who was coming up behind them and he told them if they need to 'move\" that car to make the turn he was coming up and would deal with the driver.\n\nThe firetruck got as far as he could to the right and pushed the car at the back side of the bumper and moved them a foot or 2 before the car let up their brakes and moved to the left.\n\nThe truck driver got a \"talking too\" and had to take some online safety course. Meanwhile the car driver for a ticket and 0 help from insurance as the story goes.\n\nI'm sure some details were changed over the years of telling it.",

Technically, if you hit a car en route to an incident, you have to stop and have to put yourself out of service because you are in a traffic accident. The driver typically plans way ahead their route as they pull up to the intersection and 99% of the time (in my area at least) if the intersection is full,  you would just drive on the other side of the road. If the intersection is completely full and you can\u2019t get to the other side of the road, you just turn off your sirens and wait for the green.\n\nMy personal experience with the fire department going to a structure fire, they know they don\u2019t want to stop for anyone so they drive on the opposite side of the road a lot.",

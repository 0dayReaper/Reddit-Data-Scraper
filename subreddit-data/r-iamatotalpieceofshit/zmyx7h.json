He chose to leave the force given the extent of the death threats and such. Realistically I don\u2019t think he\u2019d have been able to continue working there either way. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not an excuse, I was explaining the reason he made that choice. \n\nAFAIK, he was the only officer who used pepper spray, and he was the most senior among the guys there, so I\u2019d presume it has smth to do with that, but I can\u2019t say for sure. The protesters were ordered to disperse several times over the course of a couple of hours, and refused to do so. The crowd also surrounded the officers and were refusing to let them leave. \n\nAgain, not saying he was right for what he did. I\u2019m not justifying his actions, I\u2019m giving context.",

American policing has a culture of these sorts of things happening, and we hear about it all the time. If officers held their coworkers more accountable, things would change.\n\nAn example: I saw a story on reddit about a cop that got fired for giving man a sandwich full of feces. Gross. Duhumanizing. Happy he got fired after the public made a fuss about it. And then the department a few counties over (I believe) hired him. I blame the entire department at his new county for allowing him to, possibly, probably, continue to menace the public. It doesn't matter if they didn't personally give a homeless man a feces sandwich: they said, \"we don't care about the terrible thing you did, come back to work\".\n\nI don't think every police officer is personally a terrible person. I think they work in a field that allows terrible people to thrive, and not enough of them step up to do anything about it.\n\nThat's why acab.",

Never heard of the study but there is plenty of people who do not feel hungry (I mean outside of eating disorders) and various studies noticed that said people always underestimate how much they actually eat. Most do not believe that as they usually know they need food so they tend to eat regulated amounts at regulated times. I have seen experiments where they got filmed, with their knowledge, and had snacks they forgot about. I also was born without the ability to feel hungry (I sort of acquired it as an adult, not sure if it matches others but then again - we all perceive things differently). I refused food right away and returned it. Any food in any way or shape or form. People tried to feed me whole day and in all their attempts, they clearly forgot I had taken a few bites here or there, which for babies was fine apparently (I am still here!). I do not think, I forgot bits I eaten as a kid or a teen as I tended to hide food but I could have.\n\nAnother good way to observe that is chronic insomnia - people without ability to fall asleep can actually not notice falling asleep and unfortunately, it is not great as their brain also does not interpret it as sleep so it does not regenerate. My mum has that, I often observed her sleep a few hours as she claimed not to sleep at all. So yep, brains are fun this way. The thing is - there is plenty of materials available on how humans work so no excuse to think your baby will photosynthesise just because you think you do.",

He still drank water though. This type of ideology is kinda contagious for some reason, it's a slippery slope",

They believe we have the ability to survive as plants do, however anyone who has any sort of basic grade school level of education knows that even plants are not simply sustained by air and sunlight but also need water, minerals and nutrients pulled by their roots from the soil the survive. All of the popular \u201cspiritual gurus\u201d leading these groups and making these claims have been caught eating or grocery shopping in public and have either refused to undergo medical examinations or observation to prove their claims.

Of course it's all nonsense this is far from the first time this philosophy has led to death.

Adults still doing this religiously are delusional to think that you can escape the laws of biology.\n\nReminder since clearly some adults need it:  we are not plants. Plants have what are called choroplasts that contain chlorophyll and they have the ability to capture energy from sunlight to survive and thrive. Humans don't have cholorphyll or chloroplasts. No humans do. Not even these quacks. It is impossible for a human to have that. Therefore we have to derive energy from external sources,that can be either fat,protein or carbohydrates,but it can't be sunlight. \n\nWhy not use sunlight to cook instead if you want to incorporate it so badly. There is special cookware to do that. I use the sun to brew my tea. I know of people cooking lighter foods with it.",

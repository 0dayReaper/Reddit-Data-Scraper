Santa cruz is the state/region that most strongly opposes the ruling party and the population felt that the arrest (they ram his car, put a hood in his head, drove him to the airport and lifted him away in a chopper) was not done well.\nThe governments response to peaceful protests has been to go heavy on the protestors and have the police create damage so it looks like rioters are doing the damage and police are keeping things in check with their brutality.",

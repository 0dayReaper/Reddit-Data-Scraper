Is it correct?   I dont  \nknow.  We will all see",

Meanwhile, the people in power are doing everything to destroy any social structures that would prevent that \"squeezing\", one of the main target is the educational system because educated people would be able to think by themselves and stop swallowing the pre-digested propaganda they are served everyday. Most of the people are being brainwashed dead with all sorts of fears, including the fear of being poor and are going full self centered/selfish. this destruction of the education system results in the 6th of January insurection for example.\n\nAs the U.S. culture is radiating over the world, we start to see this phenomens growing everywhere.\n\nIn this case, rich guys is just serving its own interest based on the society he lives in. The American way of life is THE real POS.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nPS: I talk a lot about the U.S. but this situation is non exclusive to the U.S.",

One persons spending is another persons income, so less spending means less income. Lower income decreases demand. Therefore businesses won\u2019t produce as much so they won\u2019t need as many workers, hence the higher unemployment. So yeah curbing inflation inevitably leads to unemployment. Of course, it\u2019s all a lot more complicated in real life but that basic process always plays out.",

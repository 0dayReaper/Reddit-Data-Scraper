For as satisfying as it would be to see that guy get what he deserves, it would probably be far worse for the patient than having to wait longer to get to the hospital. In fact playing traffic games like that could lead to an accident that results in the patient not only being in a far worse position, but also unable to get to the hospital for far far longer than even the douchebags driving resulted in.

But I gather it's an issue in some parts of the world where civilians will purchase retired emergency vehicles, and then use them to cheat their way through traffic. And so because of that, a culture of vigilante drivers has emerged, and they do this sort of thing to stop them. But of course, there's no way to know which ones are real, and people shouldn't do that.\n\nSo that's my guess of what happened here. The BMW felt some unjustified road rage based on their incorrect assumption that it wasn't a real ambulance.\n\nBut yeah, glad they got caught. That's so stupid and dangerous. Even if it was a fake ambulance, this is still irresponsible driving.",

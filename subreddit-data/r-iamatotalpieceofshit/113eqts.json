Cats get run over in residential neighborhoods with regularity. In many places even Ferrell cats are caught fixed and turned back out because predators like coyotes, fox, bobcats, and birds of prey have become dependent on them as a food staple. Predators predominantly also hunt at night, the ones you see during the day are usually sick or starving. Here where I live in the south west many small dogs left unattended in fenced yards get drug off by predators as well. There\u2019s usually one or more in our local area on a bi weekly basis. All of it could almost certainly be avoided by attentive owners who don\u2019t leave them outside unattended. \nDo you not see the hypocrisy in one owner being mad the dogs were loose and unattended but theirs became a victim because they had done the exact same thing? It absolutely sucks to lose an animal in any manner especially like they did. In this case the dogs were being dogs and it was just as likely a predator would do the same eventually Especially if their domestic cat had no fear because maybe they have a dog that\u2019s cat friendly. I have 2 cats and 2 dogs and these cats have no idea a dog would do them harm. In fact it\u2019s the opposite my dogs know to give them space if they don\u2019t want to get a smack or two. In the outdoors it\u2019s simply Darwin\u2019s world of survival of the fittest without some type of intervention. I know people who\u2019ve declawed cats and let them out where they have no real chance of defending themselves.  Which to me is wrong to take away their ability to defend themselves or to put them in a situation where they may need to unnecessarily.",

( yes my friends mom was scummy for keeping cats outdoors and getting so many)\n\nI lived in California b4 I moved out and there's risks of coyotes, and ofc if ur by the mountains, mountain lions tho rare its mostly coyotes.\nEven if you're careful you easily lose pets..my grandma loves her pets unfortunately she lives right by mountains. she had a cat she had my elder chihuahua we couldn't take care of anymore she loves them and takes care of 3 other large dogs who she keeps outdoors but well taken care of while the cat and smaller dog stays inside except for a bit for potty.\n\nEven with the big dogs and the bit of outside they get eventually they disappear thanks to coyotes....daytime, nighttime doesn't matter to those fking predators....she lost every cat she got and 2 of my elder small dogs were taken, she stopped trying replacing her cat because of it. ( she didn't have multiple cats just one, she loves cats she only got a new one 2 other times then gave up hell the last 2 got out by accident due to their garage they have a big house and yard so easily miss small pets)\n\nIt is just better off for small pets to be indoors and leashed or supervised outdoors",

My family kept outdoor cats until one tried to jump to the neighbors roof (which he routinely did) and missed the jump. Worst day of my mother\u2019s childhood, and from that moment forward my grandmother agreed no more outdoor time for the cats. \n\nOn top of being dangerous for your kitty, it\u2019s also bad for the environment. Cats kill off animals that are beneficial to local ecosystems, spread disease, and also in many areas cats have very few (if any) natural predators so cat colonies can easily approach the line between \u201cjust a lot\u201d and straight up invasive species. \n\nIf you adopt a cat that has been outdoors their whole life and they suffer from being inside all the time, the best bet would be some sort of boxed patio you can let them into, or leash and harness training so you can regularly spend supervised time with them outdoors.",

Also cats are a menace on song birds. It's just better all round to keep them indoors.",

He still has his back claws but in a situation where he would have to defend himself, he couldn\u2019t utilize them. He can box and quite hard for a cat, but they feel like a 2 year old with a sock-em-bobber hitting you in the thigh. \nMy second cat has claws in all 4 of his paws, but he can\u2019t fight. He\u2019s only 2 years old and wants to play with everyone and everything. He doesn\u2019t know there are animals out there looking to kill and eat him. \nMy mother has this thing we\u2019re she like to let the cats out to \u201cBe cats\u201d yet the point of having cats is to keep them indoors because they are \u201cdomestic cats\u201d. Me, my younger and older sister has brought up our concerns with this and she always says \u201cOkay. I understand. I won\u2019t let them out anymore.\u201d And then let them out for hours the next. She even leaves them out from 11PM at night till 10:30am in the morning while we\u2019re all asleep. So I\u2019m scared that she\u2019s gonna let the cats out one night for the last time just for them to not come home again, And then say that it wasn\u2019t her fault. \nShe had done this for so long to the point that I know that trying to reason with her is pointless. The last time me, by brother and sister tried to reason with her, she returned our concerns with hostility and said she would disconnect us from the internet and confiscate our electronics if we continue to \u201cattack\u201d her. We\u2019re only looking out for our cats best interest. \nI\u2019ve tried keeping the cats in, and even stayed up late to make sure they get back in. \nThis night, afew hours ago. I heard loud meowing. For a second, I thought it was my video until I paused it and it continued. \nI knew it was my cat at the back door.\nI didn\u2019t even known he has gotten out. \nWhat was even more concerning was that it was late at night and in the middle of winter. A Canadian winter. \nAs I said, I worry for my cats. Because my mother dosen\u2019t.",

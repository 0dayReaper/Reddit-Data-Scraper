Out of over 8 billion human beings this small (on that scale) community of people are somehow a great threat to \u201cthe way of life.\u201d In reality it\u2019s just another \u201cflag\u201d to point the cults anger at so they won\u2019t question those controlling them or their beliefs.\n\nThere is no one way of life, there is only one way of death. We will all eventually follow that same path. Before that end why not just live what you have the most naturally, fulfilling, and uplifting instead of making it about bringing others down around you?\n\nIn death we are removed from the equation.

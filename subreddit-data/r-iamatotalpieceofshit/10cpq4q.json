People can start creating biases against certain people after past experiences. This is usually called reputation. Once someone does something enough times people assume they are still doing it. If someone steals enough when something goes missing people assume that person stole it even without any evidence. They will often use past experience to justify this assumption. So in this situation when someone who you know is against Trans people make a comment you just assume it's a target against Trans people but not by the evidence shown in the situation but by your opinion of the person.\n\n\nAlthough to be fair patterns exist for a reason. So your bias may be right.",

Will their bodies be at the same stage three years later when the one who was on blockers decides to stop. The answer is obviously no.\n\nStudies have already shown that blockers affect your bone density, that it has the potential to weaken your bones. I read articles of people who decided to take lupron and that they had serious health problems years later. Does it happen to everyone? Probably not but to say that it has no ill side effects is flat out wrong. Most articles that I read talking about the long term side effects  says that there\u2019s still not enough evidence to say one way or another.\n\nSo we\u2019re essentially giving these drugs to kids and letting them be Guinea pigs. Did you know that lupron is also given to sex offenders to chemically castrate them? Doesn\u2019t sound like a drug that I\u2019d give my child.",

The argument is basically that many people in the trans-community are utterly ignorant about what is best for both children and adults and what the best method is for dealing with these rare phenoma such as gender dysphoria. Much of what some of these people suggest are harmful and not helpful both for society and the individual.\n\nJP is strongly against the abuse of children. Because  pushing the narrative to teens that they can identify as whatever is harmful.\n\nThus, his post is merely pointing out the ridiculous stance that some people in the trans-community dare take.",

Meaning, according to the most modern research and studies, gender affirming care is the best way to treat gender incongruence or dysphoria. \n\nTo use your comparison, it would indeed be considered like a cleft palate. While using the term illness can get hackles raised because a transgender person isn't \"ill\" in the traditional sense of the word, it should be treated as a physical illness. Their bodies are not congruent with who they are. While the root cause of this incongruence hasn't been identified, there has been enough evidence that treatment such as hormone replacement and surgical intervention has positive, life changing effects. Much like repairing a cleft palate. :)\n\nIn a matter of choice, a transgender person doesn't make that choice to be transgender. It is how they are hard-wired. It isn't changeable, much like being hetero or homosexual. Not everyone needs the same interventions and that is where psychiatric care comes in. It is to help a person understand where they are and what healthcare is needed to find the right treatment for them. In a perfect world, doctors and patients would work together without outside pressures from either \"side\" in the unnecessary debate surrounding trans people.\n\nI hope this can clarify it for you, as I feel like your question was earnest!",

He will never come out and say something straightforward; it will always be some cryptic, insinuative, convoluted idea that leaves just enough room for interpretation that he can deny any argument made against it. \"You're twisting my words\" is one of his catch phrases for a reason.\n\nI have no idea what exactly he's trying to say here, but it is definitely a dig at wokeness and gender identity. No way Jeeperson would use 'identify' in a non-snarky way.",

Shame \n\nThere is a study on serial killers and why they don\u2019t kill once in prison. It is interesting why that is, but nonetheless he can\u2019t kill what gives him pleasure and without that/outside of that he/they can appear completely normal. The study also touches on how the urge to kill is diminished and could be consciously acknowledged which aides in that person appearing normal. They know they can\u2019t kill what they want so they \u201cdon\u2019t stress it,\u201d so to speak. I\u2019ll try to find it and post",

I believed in death penalty until David Wong in a cracked podcast described his argument against it and I took it further with the fact we can\u2019t ensure there is an afterlife. \n\nFor people we can prove without a doubt that they commit as heinous of an act as this post, laws regarding solitary confinement should be ignored. The laws were put in place because staying in a single quiet room 24/7/365 will make a person go literally insane. IMO they should then be strapped in and taken for a longer ride. \n\nSadistic? Absolutely. But those children will never exist again and that is beyond haunting. My daughter is 5 and I *need* to know what she thinks as she gets older because she\u2019s an individual and gaining perspective in ways I can\u2019t properly articulate. To imagine some dude could end that and not care makes me wish the worst psychological torture on them so they don\u2019t have a single good thought ever again. \n\nPeople like the dude in the post aren\u2019t afraid because they\u2019ve never been pushed to those extremes. He sees it as time to waste and chill. I want him to be locked away and to only have someone slamming food into his chamber, ensuring he stays alive and hosing down the room for cleaning purposes. \n\nTLDR; death penalty is almost certainly a reward unless we prove there\u2019s an afterlife he *will* suffer in. He took those children entire future and any ideas or fresh perspectives they could have introduced to the world and those around them. The least we could do for them is ensure he suffers to a sickening degree.",

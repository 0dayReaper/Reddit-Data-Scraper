So wild I struggle to believe it's real.\n\nSo, first and foremost, this is a gay couple, both are women. Laura who is filming and who is tattooed all over the woman we see, Narally, is insanely manipulative and narcissistic. They do have a child together, keep that in mind. Laura is a serial cheater and loves recording and surprising her wife with her flings. She has provided everything to Narally who has very obviously became insanely co-dependent. Every video they have posted to their family YouTube in the past few months has been Laura lying repeatedly to Narallys face and calling her names and reminding Narally she would have no where to sleep if she left. Overall, Laura is the scum of the earth and very blatantly does not care about Narally but wants her around because all of this entertains her. Narally has tried to leave but gets wrapped back up every time. It's so horrible and unhealthy and I pity the child they brought into the world (through IVF ofc which Laura paid for). It's awful. I hope it's acting to get views but those tattoos are so so real and watching Narally react to Laura in real time makes me think it's real. Ahhhh I hate it. \n\nNarallyMorales is the abused girls YouTube. She's trying to get out of the relationship still, trying to get the tattoo removed. Abusive relationships are a rollercoaster y'all",

After the incident at the exit of the store, the woman pushed her grandmother off the porch.\n\n\u00ab Lucky that she only got off with bruises. Today I will write a statement on this woman. The precinct said that the maximum fine would be written out under the criminal article. Now she, as far as I know, is in a psychiatric hospital.

After the incident at the exit of the store, the woman pushed her grandmother off the porch.\n\n\u00ab Lucky that she only got off with bruises. Today I will write a statement on this woman. The precinct said that the maximum fine would be written out under the criminal article. Now she, as far as I know, is in a psychiatric hospital. Personally, I have never seen her before, and my grandmother also \u00bb, \u2013 transmits words of the granddaughter of the injured \u00ab Newspaper.ru \u00bb.",

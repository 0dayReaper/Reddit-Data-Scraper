There's an expectation of occasionally wrong decisions being made and honestly the precedent that would set would hurt way more people - that is an immensely complex system. Also those situations can lead to the opposite - what happens if kids are taken away unjustly and end up abused by temporary caregivers? That also happens sometimes. \n\nSuing doesn't hold anyone accountable. If we actually funded child protective systems appropriately we'd be able to do more to investigate things but as of now it is underfunded and social workers are underpaid and massively overworked (in a field where they are regularly exposed to trauma).",

And then the father they gave custody to beat his child to death. What decision do you need the context for? He beat a 4 year old to death. If they said the 4 year old cried so he started beating the kid would that context make it okay for him to have killed that child? I think that\u2019s against the law. Do you want us to change the law to make it legal to kill children? I\u2019m just not following you.",

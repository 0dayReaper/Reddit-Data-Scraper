If it weren't for the 3 characters (real people) in the movie, the U.S.A. never would have sent John Glenn into space. Apollo 11 would never had made it to the moon.  I also am usually a sucker for movies that are based on or inspired by true events and this movies hits every button I have. I've watched it at least a dozen times.",

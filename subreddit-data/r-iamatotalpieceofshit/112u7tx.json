You can't just throw evidence at a judge and say \"here's the proof, now punish this guy for breaking the law.\" A prosecutor has to understand the case and expend the time and effort to prosecute it over months.\n\nOn top of that, the primary reason charges are dismissed in Philly is because witnesses don't show up (both civilian and police). The cops don't like a DA that calls out their bad behavior, so they punish him by refusing to help prosecute minor crimes. The result is someone broke the law, everyone knows they broke the law, but the DA can't meet the burden of proof, so there's no choice but to dismiss the charges, which makes the DA look ineffective.\n\nSomehow, I don't think many people would be happy with the DA going back to looking the other way on police misconduct to get them to do their jobs.",

Enough theft means the company might really be losing noticeable margin. If that didn't occur, their bottom line would look better and COGS would be lower and **theoretically** they could shovel that money into operations (i.e. paying workers.)\n\nNow, yes, I'm aware of the current modern hypereffecient exploitation of workers, meaning, okay, likely savings from reduction of large scale theft/inventory shrinkage would not end up in the pockets of workers or hiring more.\n\nSo, no, directly speaking under our current culture, \"not stealing\" isnt going to \"help the middle class,\" or whatever, but conceptually, \"everybody not stealing\" is a foundational piece of having a fair, cheap, accessible market place.\n\nAlso worth noting, *significant* theft is in fact on the rise. Mass organized rings to steal from retail inventory and resell online using generic storefronts/Amazon/ebay is like, a genuine issue with non-trivial % impact on retail. Again... This is a chicken and egg problem exacerbated by digital age methods to drive profit margins to the 1% meaning the middle class is in the kind of desperate straights that *lead to* that kind of thing... So sure, it's sort of reaping what they sowed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGranted, \"everybody not stealing\" **also** applies to managers conducting wage theft, corporate cultures that exploit underpaid workers, etc., So I'm not suggesting that middle class theft is somehow victimizing poor corporations, just pointing out that \"not stealing in general\" is a big part of the general \"Social Contract\" theory.",

Lawyers cost money, court costs money, etc.  I don't work in retail, but I do work in an industry that has to be involved in court occasionally due to getting sued for people believing they've been wronged (sometimes correctly, more often incorrectly) and there is an equation to it all.  \"Being right\" often has very little to do with it--though, to my company's credit, we have gone to court to defend ourselves at times when I believed it was a matter of principal (and won)--but in reality it probably cost us 5 times more to go to court than the amount we were awarded.  \n\ntl;dr:  it's cheaper not to prosecute; the entire system is pretty screwed",

And in response the crime becomes more popular. \n\nIn certain municipalities DA's literally don't press charges for misdemeanor shoplifting and petty theft, so people grab as much merchandise as they can without going over the felony limit, and they have literally nothing to worry about. It's possible that's what's happening in this video which is why the shoplifters are so brazen. They know when they get caught that nothing will happen to them.",

A person who opened the store in their community to serve it. A person that will still need to pay the corporate overlord it\u2019s share, regardless of what the franchise loses to theft. \n\nThis is stealing from a community member. Ya they are Rich, but they are contributors to your community. They are also working on 5% or less profit. \n\nStealing like this forces prices to increase so much quicker than government over spending. \n\nHit one, hard. Let them know it\u2019s not free. There\u2019s a cost.",

Isn't the point of going to a bar to get drunk? As I see it, him driving after that is a result of his own poor judgement.\n\nIf the bar is at fault, at what point are they required to stop serving a customer? Wouldn't it be somewhat subjective since everyone responds to alcohol differently?",

Murder is typically defined as the intentional, unjustified killing of a human by a human.  To prove murder, you must prove all of these elements.  \n\nSpecifically: \n1) defendant committed an act (\u201cact\u201d in criminal law means \u201ca voluntary muscular contraction.\u201d)\n2) they did so with intent to kill \n3) a human died\n4) the defendant\u2019s act caused the death of said human.  (Here, an act will be found to have \u201ccaused\u201d the death if the victim would have lived any amount of time longer than they did but for defendant\u2019s act, even if that amount of time was only one minute.)\n5) the killing was unjustified. Note: prosecutor need not prove this. If prosecutor has proved the above elements, they have proved murder.  Defendant may then raid an \u201caffirmative defense\u201d such as self defense or defense of others if they want to.  An affirmative defense is one in which defendant acknowledges they did what they are accused of, but the have a legal justification.  Importantly, the burden is then placed on defendant to prove the elements of the affirmative defense.  I.e., they must prove they had a reasonable fear of imminent death or grievous bodily harm from victim.\n\nIf you prove elements 1-4 and defendant can not prove #5, you have proven murder.\n\nWhat you are talking about is degrees of murder. Most jurisdictions will find any murder that was planned ahead of time to be First Degree while a spur of the moment murder (e.g., husband finds wife in bed with another man and shoots them) to be second degree.\n\nBoth are murder, we just punish the former more than the later. \n\nIf you can prove elements 1, 3, and 4, but not 2, you have manslaughter (the unintentional, unjustified killing of a human by a human.)\n\nEdit: typos",

I knew a guy who was in a terrible DUI accident in laguna Beach where he rolled his car and killed 3 people. All 3 people were in his car (dunno if that helped) but he only got 3 years in prison with parole. He didn't try to flee from the accident though and I think the main difference for the guy in the video was that the guy he killed was a cop, so they might not take too kindly to that.",

The penalty for drunk driving is more severe than the penalty for fleeing.\n\nLearned this after a guy I knew when we were kids (he was a POS even back then; he went on to become a lawyer) t-boned and killed some poor woman while he was driving drunk *at 8 in the morning*, then went and hid in the woods until he couldn't be breathalized anymore. I don't think he even got jail time.\n\nETA for anyone mistaking my intent: no aspect of this post should be taken as legal advice. Or moral advice, for that matter.",

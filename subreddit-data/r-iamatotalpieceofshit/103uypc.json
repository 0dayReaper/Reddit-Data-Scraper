My husband has had two ESA which where a dog and a cat. The dog he had for 14 years so was able to pick up on signs of his mental health issues as well as symptoms of his heart failure. We currently have 5 cats but I would only call 1 of them an ESA she is able to pick up when he is starting to feel unwell. If she picks up that he is starting to have an anxiety or panic attack, she begins rubbing on him or will initiate a game of fetch. If he starts making pained noises or having breathing trouble but I\u2019m not close enough to hear, she will come alert me. If she hears the pained noises from the other room, she runs in and tries to comfort him. The other pets don\u2019t do this, at least not in response to recognizing he is unwell. \n\n\nThat being said\u2026 he would never bring her out into public and certainly not demand people allow her in special places. She is not trained to work in public. She is not trained to ignore other stimuluses so she doesn\u2019t miss signs from him. The only places he would need to bring her to help with his mental health issues is a medical setting where\u2026 it\u2019s either a short doctor\u2019s visit (probably not intense enough to trigger an episode), a hospital (where the doctors can give medical care if something happens) or a procedure such as a CT scan where they wouldn\u2019t  let even a fully certified support animal in.",

If a service animal showed aggression or behavior that disrupted the normal working of the restaurant we were allowed to ask the customer to remove it. She also told us no legitimate service animal would ever do that.

I think of it as medical risk going both ways.  If the proprietor or employee were to be deathly allergic, it is egregiously burdensome and not a proper balance of law, along with a hostile work environment to make somebody work around that which will poison them without proper PPE and ventilation and cleaning.  Even a non-deathly allergy is hazardous to health with long term exposure.  There is also the right to be in business that a decent court will attempt to respect.  \n\nImagine someone bringing peanut dust sandwiches to a school cafeteria, then saying that they have the right to eat whatever they bring as their classmate chokes out.  \n\nVersus:\n\nImagine someone with celiac disease working at a very dusty flour mill without a respirator.  \n\nOne is danger inherent to regulations that didn't provide a reasonable out due to balance of health risks.  The other is danger inherent to line of business.",

As soon as he answers, legally, the woman should have stopped questioning him or asking him to leave. \n\nI\u2019ve had to deal with service animals in businesses that are open to the public for 10+ years, and from everything I\u2019ve learned in training or about ADA compliance, pretty much everything this woman did will get her in legal trouble.",

I feel this constant need to look after my cousins because I have 22 of them and I am the oldest and babysat everyone growing up... I don't mean to be like this and that's probably why my life sucks\u2026 I've gotten rid of all the toxic people in my life except for family but I'm slowly letting them fade out too now. I kept comparing myself to my cousin because we were both locked up but now I know that we are both completely opposite people.",

But I had a friend who believed in conspiracies when got into debt. He started smoking weed a lot and all of his friends dropped him, but me.\n\nHe said the wildest stuff for 5 years, and now he has a succesful job, a girlfriend, a paid house and he laughs. During a Christmas dinner after 5 years he was back at the table.\n\nSo yeah, drop who ever you want and think that the solution is to cut them off. No one wants to do hurt, it is part of life. And part of being a human. Individual decision making is very precious, but we live in a society where we need each other. So i value my side more than what simple narrative that guy said.\n\nBut I guess this is reddit and the internet.\n\nSo no abuse, just very patient and maybe almost naive in my trust. Anyway, never drop your family. You only got your family. In good and bad times. Would be very weak to drop your family in bad times, because you feel bad.",

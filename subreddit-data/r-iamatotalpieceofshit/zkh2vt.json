Toxic masculinity is \u201ca set of certain male behaviors associated with harm to society and men themselves.\u201d The belief that men can\u2019t share their emotions is one of these harmful beliefs about how men should behave, so it\u2019s toxic masculinity. Toxic femininity would be beliefs we hold about how women should act that are harmful.\n\nPeople like you often misunderstand the idea of toxic masculinity and think it\u2018s meant to be something only perpetrated by men, but as this post shows, that\u2019s not true at all.",

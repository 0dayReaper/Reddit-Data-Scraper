I don't know why we don't expand that one instead with more stations. \n\nBut instead we have those scooters cluttering the sidewalk and thrown in bushes and rivers. Because ofc people like them because they can just go straight where they want to go instead of having to go to a bike station. \n\nBut i feel like the bikes could be so much more competitive with more stations. No way one of those scooters is cheaper to buy and maintain compared to a normal bike. And also can't be that hard to put more smaller 2-3 bike stations around instead of only having fewer big 5-10 bike stations.",

They ruin cities, they're placed everywhere making the sidewalk unpassable, the batteries are so cheap to produce that they just replace the batteries every month or so, causing a huge amount of pollution mining all the lithium needed for the batteries. Property damage of big companies is not worse than damage to people's lifes, the owners of the scooter companies profit of slavery and bad working conditions.",

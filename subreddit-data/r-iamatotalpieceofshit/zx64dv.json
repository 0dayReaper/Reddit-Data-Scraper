She has a lengthy record for shoplifting and other offenses in the parish that she did this so hopefully she will get some jail time. Cuz this is disgusting. The homeless person has been reunited with family and has temporary housing now and hopefully will get long lasting help. Lots of agencies have stepped in to offer support for the victim. I hope some good comes out of this.",

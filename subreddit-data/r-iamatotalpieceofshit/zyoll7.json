Tell them if they gonna put a gun on you, you got all the reason to go full speed into a tree or off a pier or into on coming traffic with a semi. Tell them the faster you go, the quicker you both die. Make sure to lock the doors when you say it and turn to look em dead in the eye as you hit the pedal harder to really drive the point.",

I\u2019d rather have a $20 in my wallet at all times and give them that. At least they know you actually had money and that\u2019s all you have in that spot vs them wondering if you\u2019re lying",

It wasn't like he grabbed a boob, or she kicked him in the cock, or she delivered a baby during this. An Uber driver was robbed, and that sucks.\n\nJust don't see the need either way.",

Through no fault of my own I have some minor disabilities that make it harder to walk and if I need to do stuff in the city, I don't have to bring my car, I can come to the city with public transport and then take a bike, which is also a lot more flexible than a car.

And depending on the tires and car you have that can be very annoying to deal with. It's usually better to replace tires in pairs so you don't have tires of all different tread levels on your car. And if the car has off road or 4x4 tires it becomes even more important to replace them together.",

The mayor is really breaking his balls, says if there\u2019s no suspect by Friday they\u2019ll have to call in the FBI. I\u2019ve also heard Interpol has 4 or 5 known bicycle tire deflators on their most wanted list, wonder if the task force has thought to compare MOs. Probably not, frigging hayseeds. Maybe the city will catch a break and Batman will get involved, I remember back in \u201807 when that kid tried to let the air out of the tire of the Batmobile. Poor guy, I mean I know he had it coming, you don\u2019t mess with the Batmobile. But still, melting a guy\u2019s face off and playing the video at his funeral is extreme, even for the caped crusader. Anywho, yeah let\u2019s hope there are some prints",

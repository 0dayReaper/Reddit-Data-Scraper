I know what I want and where it is when I walk in, and I want to get it and get out quick. He can\u2019t keep up with me because of sausage legs and obviously he attracts a lot of attention and everyone wants a pat or a cuddle, which is cool. \n\nMy only defence for the dog is that the person was bitten on the face, which means they most likely were on their knees or squatting/bending down, but I\u2019m sorry, if they bend down and stick their face into the face of a giant dog they don\u2019t know, then they should be prepared to accept part of the blame. You don\u2019t know how a dog will react and we even tell our girls not to get in our dogs face, and our dog is super placid at home with us, and she would never hurt us deliberately but still, she is a big mother fucker, both her parents were pigging dogs, so if she was to snap and their face is there, it would be terrible. Now if the customer was in the shop and just bending down to look on the shelf and the dog was walking past, saw a face and went for the chomp, they have no defence.",

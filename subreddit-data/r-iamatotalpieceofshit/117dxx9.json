The arriving officer is holding the guy's arms at his side and is aggressively spooning him so hard that his dick is practically in the man's ass.  How the hell is he suppose to put his hands behind his back?  Where?  There is no space left to put his arms into.\n\nAlso, even if the man had space to move his arms into, I wouldn't blame him for freaking out and being non-compliant.  The way the arriving officer grabbed a hold and pressed into him was so suddenly and oddly sexual, I half expected him to start whispering seductively into the man's ear and for the Hub's logo to show up in the corner.",

We have no rights, because if a cop can beat the shit out of you or kill you for no reason then you have no rights.

It's never as simple a situation as any of us make it sound when we're commenting on a subject like this.  For the record, I'm not one of those advocating to abolish the police.  I recognize we need police. But I truly don't think it's right that police generally don't face consequences for depriving citizens of their civil liberties as in this particular case. The cop who body slammed the guy for nor reason at all I do believe should be fired and he should suffer a significant financial penalty (at least part of his pension should be used to pay the victim).  It's not fair that the taxpayers have to pay for his inexcusable actions.  If other police officers don't like that, they are free to quit.  If they stop working altogether and do nothing to help prevent crime, then they should be fired and replaced with people willing to work.",

There are cases where adults can't handle it and just lose their grip on sanity, letting intrusive thoughts win and committing some heinous crimes, to include murder. It's sick, but it is a reality. Some people should just not be around children or have them.\n\n...but this. This kind of behavior, where a person records and  flaunts the abuse of these little people, still learning what is and isn't appropriate in life, is horrifying. My opinion is that she was either abused like this as a child, and sees this as ok and entertaining, or she has psychiatric issues that are seriously unresolved and should keep her from ever obtaining a job like this.\n\n&gt;a criminal background check and a child abuse check. Both came back clear\n\nI really believe that people who are in a position of having the responsibility for the welfare of people's lives, as well as able to obtain weapons that can end them, should ABSOLUTELY have a required psychological evaluation, beforehand.",

It's a very, very difficult section of the work to get through, just so depressing.\n\nAbuse, hate, bigotry, and things of that nature are all learned. No child is born caring about the color of anyone's skin, or caring about it someone wears pants vs a dress. No child is born wanting to inflict harm. There are certain heritable  that came make someone predisposed to, say, psychopathic traits, but that's a whole different ball of wax, as the vast majority of child abusers are not psychopathic. But even heritable traits almost always require an environmental component as well. Just because you carry a certain piece of DNA, a certain gene, doesn't mean you'll exhibit it.

But a criminal complaint can't contain something like:    \n    \n&gt;Complaining officer was sent a link to Facebook video that appears to show the defendant [description of actions], etc, etc...    \n    \nThat would be a speculative complaint based on an officer's observation as a third party. To arrest and charge someone for committing a crime, the state needs a victim, and enough credible evidence provided by said victim to establish probable cause that the alleged suspect is the actual perpetrator of the crime.    \n   \nThis is a simplified explanation of the process, but hopefully it's enough to help.",

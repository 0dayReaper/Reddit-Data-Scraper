We\u2019d consider them a shack now and are almost exclusive \u201cthe hood\u201d these days. \nWe also have a lot more expenses, between TVs, video games, streaming services, etc that weren\u2019t paid for back then.\nI\u2019m actually fairly positive you could still live like a family in 1947 based off the income of one high school graduate if they went into trades/manufacturing and you didn\u2019t utilize more modern luxuries.",

If you actually factor that in, it turns out mortgages aren't really more expensive than they used to be. In fact, less interest means they are a better investment. It's gone up in the last year or so, but for example in 2020 my wife and i refinanced our home at 2.8%. We probably pay less on our mortgage now than we would on a rental for an equivalent sized home.",

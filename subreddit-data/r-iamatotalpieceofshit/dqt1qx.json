Private sales are not regulated or require registration.\n\nIn America the only illegal gun sale is from a licensed gun seller like a sports store or pawn shop to someone without going through some minor red tape.\n\nPerson to person? No way to track and completely legal regardless if that person would be denied at a licensed shop.",

You're not allowed to deal guns as a private seller - you can sell personal property but if you're specifically buying things to sell or trade you're a dealer.

(with rubber bullets.) he may have just been padded because there were also dogs. Someone else may be able to educate on why he was padded please don't quote me one this. \n\nBut this is the reality kids live with in The US now.\n\nThey have to be constantly thinking about this shit.\n\nSo the obvious conclusion is that someone makes a parody of it to cope with the sheer insanity. That kid is coping with the fact that school shootings are a thing and he has to make a joke about it.\n\nThat's my take\n\nHere's Joe with the weather",

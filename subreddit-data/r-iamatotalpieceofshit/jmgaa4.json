His dad told him go dump your whole pillow case into the bucket. Kid was totally befuddled. His dad said thats not how I raised you. Kid was 15 years old. The rest of us just laughed. As he was making the walk of shame up to the porch the dad just kept saying how embarrassing that was. Like he wasn\u2019t going to make him put it back. He said that tells him he can\u2019t trust his son to make right choices. Kid lost his phone and game consoles for awhile.",

Discarding the 'obviously staged to blazes' angle- there is a strange element of rebellion about it.\n\n\"You sniffy, cynical peekaboo camera people- let's give you a run for your money. I was only going to take one piece- but if you wanna play 'surreptitious spies' and peep at me, like this is some bogus social experiment, without an ounce of festive spirit or real generosity of any kind, I'll just fill me fuckin' boots.\"\n\nThen again- he's probably just a little shit.",

Give him a stern talking to, make him apologize to the homeowner, and give out the candy at school or something idk but the people saying he needs to be punched or some shit sound like psychopaths trying to justify their sadism.

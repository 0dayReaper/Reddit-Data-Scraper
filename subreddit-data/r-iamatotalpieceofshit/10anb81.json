It's traumatic and I'm sorry that happened to you, you didn't deserve that :(\n\nWhat my mom would do is say she was going to \"help me\" clean my room, but then if I was too slow/wasn't cleaning \"right\" or any other tiny thing, she would get wicked upset and start throwing my things into garbage bags to donate while all I could do was stand and watch. If I tried to step in and stop her, she would fly off the handle and yell at me about how I had too many toys or whatever and basically make me feel like I was being a horrible, greedy child for not wanting my things to get taken away. \n\nThat kind of trauma stays with you, and it's not dumb!! I couldn't properly clean without going into a dissociative state for the majority of my life because of that weight I was carrying, and I only managed to get better because I had accidentally turned out apartment into a hoarder den and the love of my life left because he couldn't deal with it anymore. That was what pushed me to get treatment and start the healing, and as a result I was able to win back my partner and I'm living a better life than ever \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c \n\nIf you haven't considered talking to a mental health professional about that, I would!

I\u2019m not necessarily saying that your mother was abusive, but in that case she very much exhibited an abusive behavior. Children\u2019s possessions are theirs and parents should never use them to manipulate their children\u2019s emotions. Older generations would often say \u201cI bought it, I\u2019ll take it away\u201d, and while it\u2019s true that you bought it you also gave it to them and it became their possession, to then take it away forever or break it as a punishment is just horrible. My fianc\u00e9 endured that type of behavior from her parents and now she\u2019s in EMDR for the foreseeable future so that she can unpack all of the emotional trauma that her parents inflicted on her, and she hasn\u2019t spoken to her parents in years. \n\nParents: don\u2019t do this to your children. Respect their belongings and respect their feelings, your children will appreciate it when they grow. Do you see how devastated this child in the video is? He lost a cherished possession because this \u2018woman\u2019 acted impulsively and selfishly, and you can tell by his reaction that he doesn\u2019t get cool toys like that very often.

I got in trouble for grades and my dad came up with my ds and 3ds that I'd had for years and snapped them both in half and put them in the garbage. Later, my bf at the time let me use his 3ds to play games and borrow for the day, my dad found out and smashed it. I had a charger in my bag and it meant I was using a phone (that they couldn't monitor) so I could hear him breaking that too. When I got in trouble another time, I had a nintendo switch as a gift that multiple people chipped in for. My dad threw it in the trash. (I'm not sure if he actually did though since this one was really expensive, but I saw him throw it in the garbage...) \n\nAll my stuff was monitored as a teen. An hour a day, well hidden so I couldn't use it on off times. Being that I made as much memories out of my stuff as possible, it kinda sucked to see it taken away forever. \n\n(Another incident but not a device. I have a deathly fear of bugs, and I saw a bunch of caterpillars on the walk home with my dad. I screamed and freaked out, had a panic attack, and ran home. My dad was embarrassed, came home, smacked me, and ripped up one of my books they got me as a gift as punishment. Tbh this one was my fault though lol)",

That evening, she apologized, told me she was wrong, we had a discussion on respect and boundaries (not one-sided either), and then she let me know that she\u2019d ordered the full series in hardback and it\u2019d be delivered to our house in like the near future. \n\nI was being a brat and she 100% was entitled to be upset with me. She also reacted like a brat and I was 100% entitled to be upset with her. But had you seen my mom acting in the moment, you\u2019d think she was always unhinged and reactionary when in reality, she made a bad decision in the moment, but quickly owned up to it and tried to make things right. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that this is necessarily the case with this mom. For all we know, what we\u2019re seeing is probably the kind of thing she does on a regular basis. But we also need to keep in mind that this video is not even a 20 second snapshot of this situation and be open to the possibility that we\u2019re seeing her at her absolute wits end making the wrong decision in the moment that she very quickly regrets and tries to make amends for. \n\nAgain, not saying the kid deserves it or that the mom was in the right. All I\u2019m pointing out is that we can\u2019t make a definitive judgment call based solely on one 15 second video.",

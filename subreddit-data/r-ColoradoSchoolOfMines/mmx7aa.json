    "postText": "I'm trying to get a data science minor and one of the classes I have to take for it is data structures and I'm just wondering if anyone can say what their experience is with that class. The only one that really fits into the schedule I'm trying to build is an online 8 week course at the end of the semester.\n\nI'm taking CSCI261 (programming concepts) right now, and I was just wondering is it the same amount of assignments just you have less time to do them, or is it structured differently? Same with the final project and tests/quizzes, is it just the same workload but in 8 weeks instead of 16 or is it structured differently?\n\nBasically, am I going to be suffering the last 8 weeks of the semester because it's the same amount of work in a shorter timeline or is there a difference in how it's taught/how things are assigned compared to the equivalent 16 week class?",

You might be able to email the teacher to ask for some more specifics, as I don't know how the quizzes and tests compare or if it has changed as a result of mines being more more comfortable with online classes.",

The tests felt similar to the level of test that I am taking in 262 right now. 8 weeks goes quick. If you're comfortable with the online structure, it can totally work and sometimes work better for people.",

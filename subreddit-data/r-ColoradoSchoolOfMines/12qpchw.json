Sure, but they are designed to be more private and making friends takes a lot more effort. The Trads are the stereotypical college dorm and takes pride in it. The energy is infectious, community vibes are unparalleled, and you have a lot of opportunities to get involved.",

It is a very antisocial dorm where if you aren't great friends with your suitemates you may end up SOL.  \nI would personally recommend the trads. While they are entirely worse than the other dorms, they have an unparalleled social element. You only live in the dorms for one year, so the sacrifice of comfort for a greater number of friendships is unparalleled to me personally.",

You do not want weaver.\n\nThe trads are good and easiest to have a community with your floor, if the trads Bradford is probably the best followed by Randall then Morgan. I also feel like people in the trads are less antisocial. I think this is because the trads are seen as a \u2018bad\u2019 place to live by the compsci majors of the school, when in reality the only downside is you don\u2019t have ac (which is not that big of a deal, and does not matter for most of the semesters).\n\nElm is fine and probably the most comfortable living along with spruce, but spruce seems to have overactive fire alarms, so I wouldn\u2019t live there. If you go for elm, go for the top floor, cuz those rooms have super tall ceilings\n\nWeaver and Maple seem to attract some of the stranger people at this school. Something about suite style living I think. Weaver more so tho. Weaver rooms are also incredibly small. For context, the trads and weaver have about the same amount of people living in them, but weaver is maybe the footprint of 1.5 trad buildings.",

Nearly every week, Spruce has at least 1 fire alarm go off (We've had about 13 or 14 this semester so far, compared to 2 or 3 the rest of the dorm halls have had COMBINED). Also, the bathrooms just get nasty; up on 5th floor (where I live), the drains often get clogged, and the bathroom literally floods with disgusting water. Commonly, the AC doesn't work. In the beginning of the school year, many AC units were busted and sometimes it would crank the heat all the way up to 85\u00b0F without anyway to turn it off or down. The laundry room is also ALWAYS dirty, with heaps of clothes scattered everywhere and the washers often flood on the ground. There are good things about Spruce, such as nice study areas and good views, but I just wouldn't live here again if I was given the choice. Maple or Elm would be my picks because they have the luxuries of AC and nice bathrooms, they just have less of a hassle when it comes to issues.",

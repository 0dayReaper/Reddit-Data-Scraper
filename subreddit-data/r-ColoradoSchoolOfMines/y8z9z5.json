It's an automatic thing, too; they just apply it to your transcript, you don't need to request it or anything. \n\nSeparately, could you share a little more about your experience with GPA and employers? I had a very similar experience with a shitty semester as you describe, and my GPA is...humble, because of it. Did it really pose a problem? And did you have any internships, by chance? Any tips for the similarly unlucky?",

I had 2 internships with a small company that made ultra pure water for medical and electronic applications; however they had a desalination side with O&amp;G. They weren't hiring come that summer while trying to not layoff people from the desalination side by bringing them over to the ultrapure water side.\n\nI'll be honest, I basically didn't hear back from employers that required a GPA to apply. And when it was brought up most of the time it felt like an immediate nail in the coffin for my candidacy. For reference I had a 2.8 when I graduated. Lots of B-'s but employers see anything less than a 3 as a failure in my experience.\n\nWhen I was in school Mines had a +/- system that basically led to grade deflation in my opinion.\n\nI ended up taking a shitty job having barely anything to do with my major. I worked for 9mo before quitting out of spite and desperation to leave, going back home and just networking and talking to anyone who'd listen. I now work at a major controls and automation company but it was a bumpy ride to get there.",

How you're funding your tuition, what your goals are (grad school vs. industry), how long you're okay with having a shitty gpa, and so on. Something to keep in mind is that you can only withdraw a handful of times (I think three total, but don't quote me on that). You also want to remember that if you decide to take the L and just fail whichever class (which I've definitely done), it may be a loooong time before you get that grade up and use grade replacement. So right now, you decide to fail a class. Will it have any negative consequence on your plans if you have to wait alllllll the way until the end of May to get the improved gpa on your transcript? \n\nMy experience from when I had this same dillema: For my particular source of funding (a government benefit) it makes more financial sense for me to fail a class than to drop it. I don't plan on going to grad school, and I'm okay with not getting an internship, because I've already had a couple and still have time for one more, even if I don't get one this year. So in that case, it made more sense to fail my difficult classes than withdraw from them.",

From what I understand from my own research, without yet having talked to anyone on a Friday afternoon, if he withdraws, he falls below the threshold for a full-time student and will have to pay back the VA for more than just this course as he\u2019ll become a part-time student with less than 12 credit hours. \n\nBut if he stays in and fails, the VA will pay for him to take it again, right?   With Mine\u2019s grade forgiveness policy, he potentially can correct his GPA. Even though the F will still be there, hopefully he\u2019ll do better the second time and bring up his GPA and not lose his benefit. \n\nHe seemed to get different info from his advisor today who is advising him to withdraw. I want to make sure we have all the facts before he does anything.  He needs this course for his major and it\u2019s a prerequisite by the way, Calc 1, for next level, so either way he\u2019ll have to take it again (he\u2019s 100% sure even if he got all 100% from here on out he\u2019s not going to pass).  I hate him having an F on his transcript, but if his GPA can be recalculated with a better grade when he retakes it, how bad is the F to a potential employer/internship? Anything else I missed or I should know?  Thanks!",

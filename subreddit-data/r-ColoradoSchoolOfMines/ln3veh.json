    "postText": "Hello everyone :) I am making this post to get as much behind the scenes info for the requirements of grad admissions for the MS thesis chem/ bioengineering program as I can. I\u2019ve combed through the admissions site, and visited the campus twice before \u2018rona and I love CSM. I\u2019ve gotten a lot of valuable info, but I\u2019d love to hear about your admissions/ grad school experience at Mines, and your undergrad qualifications that landed you at Mines if you feel comfortable sharing. \n\nA little bit about me: I\u2019m about to graduate with my BS in Biomedical engineering with a specialization in tissue biomaterials engineering and a minor in mathematics. Degree GPA is 3.25, BiomedicalE GPA is 3.6. I\u2019m also a very prominent student leader at my university and have over 5 years of field related work experience, not sure if any of that info will help but this is what I am bringing to the admissions table. \n\nSo, I\u2019d love to hear your honest speculations about my chances of getting in as well as your experiences/ advice, or anything relating specifically to this degree plan such as classes or professors to appreciate or watch out for. Thank you in advance for your responses \ud83d\udda4",

            "comment": "PhD in CBE at Mines. Are you planning to do thesis or non-thesis? The majority of grad students admitted to the department each year are PhD's, but there are usually a couple masters as well. (My year was 12 PhD+ 3 masters students) I can't speak to the admissions requirements for Masters, but it sounds like your GPA is decent and work experience is definitely nice too. If you are interested in a Master's thesis, I'd suggest applying for the PhD program, which has the option to exit early with a master's if the full PhD isn't working out. If there's a professor you're interested in working with you can also email them to \"talk\" about their research and see if they'd be interested in taking you. That obviously helps too. I will say that most research professors prioritize taking PhD students over Masters just because the length of time (and work) they get for a PhD student outweighs masters.\n\nIn general, I really like the department and the first year all grad students(PhD and Masters) take the same classes so you're kind of in it together in terms of struggling/learning. Feel free to PM me for other specific questions regarding classes and/or research!",

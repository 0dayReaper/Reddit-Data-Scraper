I just checked and apparently the date I had to purchase by was yesterday for next semester, and it won\u2019t let me get one online. Any advice? Is it worth it to try to email parking and see if they have any extra permits? Where can I park near campus if there aren\u2019t any? \nThanks y\u2019all. I really fucked up.",

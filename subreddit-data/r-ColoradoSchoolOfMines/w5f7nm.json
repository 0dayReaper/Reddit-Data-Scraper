Baby birds like this one cannot eat what adult birds eat (that\u2019s why their parents regurgitate into the babies\u2019 mouths). Feeding them food that is too large/heavy/dry can and will kill them painfully.  Be careful because avian influenza has been detected in Jefferson County. It is rare but can infect people.",

Bread has zero nutritional value and is too dry.",

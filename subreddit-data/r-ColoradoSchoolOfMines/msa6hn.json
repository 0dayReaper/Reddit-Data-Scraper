    "postText": "I was recently accepted into the Thorson honors program, and I was wondering whether it was worth it. I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s similar to some liberal arts classes and I have never really been into some of the classes like english, art, or philosophy; however, I have found that I have enjoyed CAD to design more practical projects. I took dual enrollment courses at FRCC and will hopefully not have to take nature and human values anyway, so does thorson have any real benefit other than replacing nature and human values and design? Without being able to go to Mines it\u2019s hard to find out what thorson is all about or what kind of community it has, so I was hoping someone would be able to help me out.",

I also think you\u2019ll get a lot more CAD experience taking freshman design than you do in IDEAS, just based off of my experience with the program",

By contrast, Intro to Design teaches Solidworks, an industry standard Cad package and is used extensively at mines. Also intro to design teaches you about the different manufacturing resources on campus and mimics other projects you will have.",

I personally enjoyed it and made close friends through it. \n\nOn the other hand, I have heard absolutely nothing good about Design. So, in my opinion, the biggest benefit of Thorson is getting out of Design. Every Thorson alumni I've talked to agrees and would make the same choice if they had another chance to decide.",

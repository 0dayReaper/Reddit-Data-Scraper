    "postText": "I'm an undergrad student right now and will be graduating in three semesters, and i met with an advisor who recommended starting to plan out the rest of my classes if i want to do a combined BS/MS (which i do). she mentioned that a full load for grad students is 9 credits, and i was wondering how much harder grad classes are. should i really only take three per semester? or is that assuming they're also TAing and i can take more? for context im in statistics undergrad and will be in data science for grad. thanks in advance!",

The homework for some of those classes were 2-3 hours after each class reading and writing reports. Some were +30 hours a week in a lab. I had peers that did not take it as seriously and I do have to say you will learn a hell of alot more if you take it seriously.",

The CS courses were the least demanding by far. The ME and EE courses had a heavier workload.\n\nA common thread I noticed is that some professors were particularly brutal because they had much higher expectations of grad students, not that the material was necessarily more difficult.",

I did do my undergrad elsewhere, but it sounds like Mines undergrad is equivalently tedious.",

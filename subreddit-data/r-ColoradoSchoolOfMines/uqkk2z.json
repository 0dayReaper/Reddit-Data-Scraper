I know the location/features aren\u2019t as nice but I like what I\u2019ve heard about social stuff in the trads. Anyone  in Grandey (or know someone) and can weigh in?\nThanks",

Push yourself to make friends and go to parties and the trads offer the best environment for that. Knowing hella people will also help you succeed academically. Trust me on this one lol",

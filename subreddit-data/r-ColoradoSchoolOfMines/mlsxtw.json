I wouldn't say the project selection is/was \\*bad\\*, but it is definitely more limited than going the traditional route (based on what others have told me). That said, the weirdest thing I've encountered was that some students (myself included) joined in on projects that were already a semester in, rather than starting their own. This hasn't been bad, it's just been strange to get due dates coordinated and assignments kept up with... \n\nIn my section this semester, there are at least 100 or so students, so plenty take this path over the traditional fall--&gt;spring. I'd say not to worry about it too much!",

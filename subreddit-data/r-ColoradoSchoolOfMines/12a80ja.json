For a civE, a = 0 (I was told this joke by a civE, pls no kill)\n\nchemE: sense the sarcasm, it's not easy\n\nMME: \"What do they do, blow glass and make swords all day?\" - my business major friend from DU\n\nApplied Math: again, not easy, I'm just giving you troll answers to a troll question\n\nmechE: they don't take ochem, how hard could it possibly be?

In recent years, new faculty, staff and graduate students have been invited to experience the event as well. While incoming first-year undergraduate students are issued hardhats that represent their class year and are asked to carry a 10-pound rock with them on the climb, graduate students are not expected to have either to enjoy the festivities. The climb is on Friday, August 20th and begins at the Intramural fields with a group going up at 8:00 a.m. and another group starting at 8:30 a.m. More information about the M Climb will be posted shortly.",

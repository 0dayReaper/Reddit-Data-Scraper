I've only poured one beer out in my life and it was their Black IPA.   I haven't been back in years, so can't really comment on the current state of things.   \n\nNew Terrain is sort of a spin off of MT.   There were four owners (3 Mines Alum, as I understand it) and as they were building the New Terrain facility, they had differences of opinion and decided to part ways, and thus Mountain Toad 2 became New Terrain.   One of the owners of New Terrain, Josh Robbins, is an alum from my era (early 90's).  I didn't know him well, but we have lots of common friends.\n\nBarrels and Bottles has been my go-to because the guests taps have been spectacular, but since they opened the second facility near the Rock Rest, they have been focusing more on their own beer vs. guest taps.   \n\nCannonball is also excellent. \n\nNever been to Coda, but I've heard they specialize in spices and additives.   They had some Milkshake IPA that is supposed to taste like Pina Colada, which just isn't my thing, so I took a pass.\n\nGCB started in 1993 when I was still a student.  We used to take empty gallon jars from the natural food store, which is now Pangea Coffee, and they would fill them for us like growlers.   On E-days, we would drain them dry.  This was before they had all the current facilities, and were brewing out of the house. They will always have a special place in my heart, and they still make great beer.\n\nAnd... Over Yonder, by the Morrison Park n Rides, is my current favorite.    Love their beer.  Plus their are fellow Dead-Heads.",

I've tried several times, and just find it undesirable. \n\nMtn toad started decent, but has gone downhill. \n\nBarrels is ok.\n\nOver yonder was ok.\n\nCoda is good. They do play with spices, so some oddball beers there.\n\nNew terrain and gcb blow the rest out of the water.  I just don't go to new terrain because it is always packed. Too many people.\n\nWhen I was at mines mid 2000s, gcb had a $5 lunch special where you got a beer, brat, and chips. And they only had a few beers then. So nice. My brother was at mines in late 90s and always raved about gcb.",

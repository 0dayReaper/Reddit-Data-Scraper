    "postText": "I'm currently a sophomore Mech E crashing and burning hard in statics. I'm honestly interested in the EE major and since statics is a core part of Mech E and I just don't understand it I'm thinking I should switch majors. So as far as classes go how's the workload and the balance throughout the undergrad? Are there a lot of programming courses? Final question how many classes would I just need a good Prof in?",

            "comment": "In my personal experience (sophomore in EE), the course load isn't too bad if you keep up on everything. Digital logic and circuits -the two courses you'd be taking- aren't a ridiculous time sunk. There is not a ton of programming, although it can increase if you're going the information and system sciences route.\nI'm actually planning on switching to comp sci and getting an EE minor (which is the flip of what I WAS doing) because I really find my classes to be a drag but that's just me. I think the introductory courses are basic enough that you should be able to pass and you won't be taking so many EE courses right off the bat that you can't switch if you hate it.\nAlso Peter Aaen is great. Super nice, super willing to spend time after class and outside of school helping with learning etc.\n\nIf you hate programming I think EE can be a good fit where you can avoid programming for the most part (you're only required to take CSCI 261 after all). \n\nIf you like programming, I'd say switch to comp sci and get an EE minor",

            "comment": "EE undergrad and MS here, I took the ISS track for background. Three classes I would use as a decent litmus test for how you\u2019ll like EE are physics II (you\u2019ll be doing a lot of similar stuff), Diff Eq (pretty much every class uses it in some form), and linear algebra if you\u2019ve taken it. \n\nDiff eq was one of my favorite classes that I took in my undergrad, and is actually what caused me to switch from MechE to EE. It is pretty much ubiquitous in the field. \n\nAs far as programming goes the state of the industry is rapidly adopting more and more programming as time goes on. I can confidently say you will be coding for pretty much every class beyond basic circuits just so you\u2019re aware. \n\nFor the final question, I\u2019d argue a good prof makes a difference in every class you take, but a lot of the Onus of success lies in your ability to work despite the prof. EE has some world class faculty, but not all of them are perfect fits for every student. \n\nI\u2019m happy to answer any more questions you may have, hope this helps",

I'm not opposed to coding completely I just don't like doing it all the time for everything I do which is what I've been experiencing in Mech E. Now are the coding and programming classes you take besides 261 teaching you new languages or would it be stuff like Arduino?",

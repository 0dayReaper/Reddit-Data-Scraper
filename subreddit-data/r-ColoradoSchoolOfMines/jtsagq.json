    "postText": "So I accidentally ran over a guy\u2019s longboard tonight in Golden when he came out of the shadows right in front of me, nobody was hurt but his board was smashed. I drove around the block looking for him after the incident but couldn\u2019t find him. If you\u2019re on here or somebody on here knows him, could you DM me the time and location of the accident and a pic of the board? I want to replace it for him but kinda hard to do when you have no idea who it is",

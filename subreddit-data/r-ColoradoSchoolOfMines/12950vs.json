I could not secure an internship during Covid, and could not find one after it do to low gpa. \n\n\nI have applied many places and I\u2019ve been ghosted every time. \nNo future for me ahead. \n\n\nEveryone else is getting job offers. I feel like such a loser. I am tired of being .\n\nI know what I probably lack a  growth, mindset or lack any soft skills. Maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m not getting a job.\n\nNetworking seems almost non existent. \nAnd no, LinkedIn doesn\u2019t count",

I applied for HUNDREDS and I mean HUNDREDS of jobs all over the US. I got some interviews and some responses but mostly no answers. I absolutely couldn't find a job I liked but in January found a great job.\n\nNow im getting paid amazing, working for an aerospace company, doing super interesting work and learning even more outside school.\n\nNot finding a job right away isnt the end of the world, the right one will pop up eventually.",

The career fair that year was a joke. It was empty tables with baskets where you could drop your resume onto a pile. Recruiters literally didn't show up to the booths they paid for. I think it might have been just as useful to drop our resumes in the trash.\n\nMy peers and I had a hard time to say the least. I was \"lucky\" in the sense that I had planned a 5 year non-thesis masters in mechanical. I ended up extending that into 2 years because I ended up doing research and dabbled with the idea of doing a thesis masters. Long story short, I didn't and went into the job market in 2011.\n\n2011 was better, but not much. I applied to 400 positions over about 6 months and it yielded 3 serious offers, none of which I wanted to move to because Colorado is hard to move from.\n\n10 years on, I have a good career and live in a decent part of the world. It was scary and hard, but my peers and I found our way. I say this not to belittle any hardships, but as a reminder that things can work out through these bleak moments. I wish you all the best and hope that this doesn't turn into something like we went through.",

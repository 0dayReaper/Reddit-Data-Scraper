    "postText": "Has anyone else been underwhelmed with the workload of field session? I was told stories of all nighters, cruel faculty, and physically daunting experiments but I've had so much free time. All I do is get drunk with the boys everynight. The hot, steamy lab conditions,  when combined with the lack of workload makes me feel like I am on a vacation in cancun, with the lovely TAs as my traveling companions.",

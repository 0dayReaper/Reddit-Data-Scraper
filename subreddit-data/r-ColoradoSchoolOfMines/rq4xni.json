I would always do the homework with friends though so that sped things up. Do most of the homeworks, all discussions, and all projects, those will carry your grade.\n\nEdit: oh and all the homeworks are online, just watch for weird due times on some assignments.",

If that does actually exist and you can take that, I would recommend saving yourself the time and money and just taking it there.\n\nI transferred Econ in as a couple of local community college summer courses. It was relatively little work and from what I\u2019ve heard about the Mines Econ, it was totally worth it since it was all online and needlessly time consuming, but ymmv.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t yet, I would at least consider transferring the econ credits in.",

You'll need to study on top of the homework as well. I suggest 30 minutes a day at minimum.",

The online book work is really easy and I would recommend doing the problems and if you don\u2019t know one, look through the book to find it instead of reading all the chapters. Most the quiz points are multiple choice and as long as you have some common sense you will be fine. I never went to class, never really read the book, and I came out with an 89 in the class for I forgot to do a couple assignments.",

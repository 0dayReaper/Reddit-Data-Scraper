    "postText": "Hey! I'm struggling a lot with my college decision and could use some insight. Basically, I'm deciding between Colorado School of Mines, Boulder, CSU, and Purdue for computer science (I live in Colorado). Some of my main thoughts are:\n\n1. I am worried about being able to make friends because I am super socially anxious and have a really hard time talking to people. Do you feel like Mines made it easy for you to find friends and a supportive community? Are there good mental health resources?\n\n2. I know Mines is a STEM school,  but I have other interests as well. Do you feel like you are able to pursue interests in other areas on the side, or would I be committing to a mostly/solely STEM experience? I did get into the Thorson honors program, does that introduce a lot of other areas or is it still mainly focused on STEM?\n\n3. I definitely want a school with good academics, but I also want time to do other things. Do you feel like you were able to find a good balance between the two?\n\n3. What are the biggest pros and cons of this school? Do you have any other thoughts on what might help me make a decision?\n\nSorry for all the questions, but I'm terribly indecisive and struggling a lot with this decision, so any information you could give would be super helpful!",

He was also accepted into CU Boulder honors but after touring, said he thought it was just too big. \n\nI can't convey enough how a good \"fit\" matters. I feel pretty confident you'll find your friends. Remember, this is new for everyone. It's one of the ways you'll bond. \n\nI'm sure you'll make a the right choice for yourself. Best of luck!",

            "comment": "All good schools, like others have said. I vote Purdue, though. Mines is great, but CS is not its forte. I would put Boulder above Mines in CS for opportunity alone (big tech actively recruits from Boulder waaaay more than they do from Mines), and I think you have to have a reeeaaaaally good reason to not choose Purdue from this lineup. Purdue has the prestige, ranks higher in CS than the other schools, has a better social environment than Mines, the top companies actively recruit from Purdue, and Purdue folk hire tf out of each other. I think -for your particular major- Purdue will set you up best out of these choices for a good future. I'm basing this off my experience working with Purdue alumni and students. With the traditional engineering disciplines like MechE, EE, ChemE, etc, I think there's more parity between Purdue and Mines, but not CS. You're having a hard time choosing between four schools, so I recommend this: drop Mines and CSU from your list, then just pick between Boulder and Purdue after visiting, researching outcomes for your major, and so on. Best of luck, and congrats on getting into these schools!",

            "comment": "I didn't do my undergrad at mines but am presently a grad student there now. I know how daunting college feels though when you're trying to decide where to go. Something that really helped me though was recognizing there is not a wrong choice. College will be tough where ever you go, but it's also largely what you make of it. You'll be able to find what you're looking for where ever you go.\n\nYou're chosing between 3 great and academically rigorous schools. You'll likely face similar challenges at any of them. The point I'm trying to emphasize is that you can take a little pressure off your self as I don't think you can pick wrong here. CU is much larger so your social opportunities will be bigger. Mines being small has its own geeky kind of microcosm (which was a draw for me personally). I havent interacted with Purdue at all other than recognizing it for prestige so I hesitate to speculate there. From what I've heard Mine's mental health resources are a little lacking but I haven't really interacted with them directly.\n\nHave you visited all three schools? That I feel like is one of the biggest things at an individual level. If you felt like you clicked somewhere better than the others, I don't think that's a gut feeling worth ignoring. If you haven't I suspect you've still got time especially if it's easy to check the CO ones off the list. And you're doing the right thing reaching out to current students. You could try looking on LinkedIn for people who went to your highschool who also went to these schools. People are usually pretty happy to talk about their experience of where they're at especially with a common background like a shared highschool.\n\nIt's an exciting new adventure you're about to embark on! I wish you the best of luck!",

I have visited all the schools, and I like them all for different reasons - I might just need to do a bit of reflection on what I'm looking for and what feels best. Also, that's a great idea to look on LinkedIn, thanks!",

            "comment": "As someone currently taking the Thorson Honors program, it replaces freshman English and freshman design, with a slight extra emphasis in English, so I would say that it does focus on topics other than stem. \n\nAs for number one, I am very similar, so I highly recommend doing a Theme Learning community. I did the Thorson Honors TLC, and it made it so much easier to make friends. Outside of the TLC I have had more trouble because I am adverse to talking, but I\u2019m sure you could find a group with common interests with little issue if you forced yourself to try.\n\nFor three and four, I can speak to this less because I am still only a first year, but it is a tough school. Expect to do homework almost every day, but you do still have quite a bit of time to do things, and often study groups are a good way to kill two birds and have fun while getting work done. The two biggest cons for me were workload, price, and distance (I\u2019m from out of state). For pros I would say the value of a degree, the instructors, the campus, and its challenging nature.\n\nIf you did well in school and got into these schools, you will do great here, but you will also do great at CSU and Purdue. No matter where you go, you will do well and find your place, but I really hope my advice answers your questions well enough, and I wish you the best in your college journey.",

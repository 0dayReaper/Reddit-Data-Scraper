    "postText": "I got accepted into Mines for Freshman admissions, and am pretty darn confident this is the school I am going to next year.\n\nJust one thing I am a little bit worried about. I have managed to take Calc 1-3, DE, Linear algebra, Calc-based mechanics, and all of general chemistry through my local CC in California. I compared the syllabi of my courses to Mines and it looks like nearly all of the same stuff is covered.\n\nIs getting my credits to transfer difficult with Mines? Just curious if any of you guys took advanced courses at an OOS CC in HS and were able to successfully (or unsuccessfully) transfer your credits.\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I did the same from a local CC in California. The transfer office will want all the syllabi, exams, etc you still have in order to \"validate\" you took the course and it was hard enough. I sent manilla envelopes fill with coursework and a short note about each course I was transferring in and I kinda doubt they went through them all but all my credits were accepted. \n\nYou'll be fine, just reach out to them soon and ask for the smoothest way to ensure your credits transfer.",

            "comment": "I did dual enrollment in high school and was luckily able to transfer my credits into Mines (roughly 20ish credits worth of various free electives and humanities classes). The process was pretty easy from what I remember, and I just had to send a physical version of my transcript from my CC to the Mines Registrar for a fee of about 2 dollars IIRC. The process wasn't too hard overall, but if your worried about stuff not transferring I'd email the transfer office or the registrar like someone previously suggested.",

I had a previous degree in a non-STEM field that took care of some HASS and Physical activity classes and 29 engineering pre-req credits. Out of all my transfer courses I only had to retake Dynamics, which I probably needed to anyway.\n\nI second reaching out to the transfer office. I've heard from some others that weren't so fortunate in getting most of their credits transferred.",

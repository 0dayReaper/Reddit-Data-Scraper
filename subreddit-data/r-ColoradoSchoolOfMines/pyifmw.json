    "postText": "Currently I am in Global Studies and I would like to know if my experience is typical of what the class is. I have a paper due tonight which is 20 points. That 20 points is also 20% of my grade. My entire class is set up so that it all equals out to 100 points total. I also have a test in a couple days that I feel woefully underprepared for, despite reading the book and attending lectures where nothing is explained. Is every Global Studies class like this, or is it just mine?\n\nTL:DR: Is every Global Studies class awful or is it just mine?",

            "comment": "Definitely within expectations. If you want easier intro and HASS classes, take them at Red Rocks. It is both cheaper and easier if either of those are a main concern. If you take at least 9 credit hours at mines and 3 or more else where you can be a full time mines student still and have FAFSA applied as if you were taking 12 hours at mines. Any FAFSA you get at one university, can only be applied to that one. So if you take some courses at a community college, you or your parents will have to pay for each course out of pocket, but they are 4 times less expensive and 3 times easier IMO",

My experience was fine, but I have friends that had nightmarish workloads.\n\nWhen registering for HASS classes, I rely pretty heavily on recommendations from friends and Rate My Professor. RMP is not always helpful or accurate, but it provides decent guidance from time to time.",

But I had a friend who said they were totally slammed with reading quizzes and multiple papers with a final and they barely passed. Always go on ratemyprofessor and check before signing up- when it comes to hass, having the right prof is seriously the difference between 1 hour per week or 10 hours per week.",

I've heard good things about the others.\n\nThe winning strategy is to get every point possible on the Essay, Discussion Posts, and Quizzes. Don't bother studying for the midterms and use your intuition. I'm personally furious that the grading in that class is so dumb.\n\nEdit: and yes, success in this class is based on professor.",

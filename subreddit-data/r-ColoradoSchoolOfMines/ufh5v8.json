With good time management, strategic class/prof selection, and extensive use of office hours, I've averaged maybe 3 hours per day. Without those things...perpetual state of stressful semi-study with many 5+ hour days to keep up/catch up. Also in those circumstances, keeping hour count low by taking the L on certain assignments. Finally, a lot of us are upperclassmen and/or transfers, so our counts *might* be lower than those of first year students going through weedout classes or having not yet settled into a routine.",

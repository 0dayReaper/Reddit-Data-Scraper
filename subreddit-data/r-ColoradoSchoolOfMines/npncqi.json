    "postText": "Just venting here because I'm incredibly pissed.\n\nIntro Econ is a lot of work and I don't enjoy it. Over the summer we are required to do \\~12 assignments every 3/4 days. This weekend I was moving out and didn't really have any time to do work on my assignments. So, I emailed the prof to ask for a 1 day extension on anything due Monday. I literally had an empty room with no desk or bed and I needed to sleep there, so the first priority was building my bed. When she responded to my email she basically said \"go fuck yourself.\" Well she didn't say that... but she said that they drop 10% of the assignments for this reason, basically telling me to not do the assignments (I have poor work ethic and already missed some by starting them too late, so this doesn't really work for me... and it also puts me at an inherent disadvantage). \n\nSo, long story short, here I am sitting on my ikea bed because I have no fucking desk yet, doing shitty econ assignments because my econ professor couldn't give a rats ass about her students mental health, or their learning. \n\nAny ideas for how to fix my econ grade lmao. I want to send her a (passive) aggressive email but I don't think that will make anything better.",

Sorry that the Econ class sucks, I know a lot of students find that class particularly uninteresting.\n\nOn the other hand, are you seriously blaming your professor here for your own poor work ethic and time management? It's pretty presumptuous to think any professor will give an extension for something as scheduled as moving, especially when not given any advance notification. You've gotta take some accountability here and point your anger in the right direction.",

Hell, someone like CPW or maybe even Baldwin would give an extension for basically any reason at all. Maybe I'm spoiled by actively nice professors and the norm should be letting students suffer.",

I'm not saying to fake stress and well being problems but I'm sure that moving and not getting any extension is a reason to get stressed and lower your mental well being.",

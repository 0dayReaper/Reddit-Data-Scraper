Ratemyprofessor gave her a 2.3 and I\u2019m wondering if I actually have to try for this humanities class or I should just switch out.\n\nThank you in advance?",

She will also email you asking for an explanation if you skip or are late to class. She grades pretty easily though. Very kind person but not a super great teacher",

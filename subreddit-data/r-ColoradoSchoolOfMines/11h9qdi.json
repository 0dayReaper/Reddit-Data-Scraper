The other nice thing about it is that you are kind of a Mines student as well ? \n\nTake a look \nhttps://www.rrcc.edu/engineering/mines-academy",

Upon successful completion of assigned coursework at a community college I will be admitted for Spring 24 semester. Are these different tracks? I am a transfer student so I guess that would make sense.",

It was great, the only things recommend is that you identify prerequisite classes and compare your transfer classes list to the degree flowchart from Mines. Some classes directly transfer, others require multiple classes (I took environmental ethics and college-level writing to replace Hass 100/200). Identifying prerequisite classes and completing them can prevent bottlenecking your enrolment in other classes in the future; most common are Calc and physics.",

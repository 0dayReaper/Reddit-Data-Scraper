    "postText": "I was unfortunate enough to lose a large group of friends the year before the pandemic, and had been looking forward to meeting new people in my in person classes fall of 2020. Obviously the pandemic happened and I was only ever in class for organic chem lab (yuck). I\u2019m lucky enough to have two close friends and a wonderful SO, but I feel like I\u2019m burdening them by trying to hang around them all the time. Any advice for combatting loneliness?",

My room was my cage and my desktop computer was my life. It's still kind of like that, but I've found studying/doing homework on campus in socially distanced but still populated areas helps. Now I savor the face-to-face interaction in in-person classes and am lucky to have found a group of friends with my roommate through playing with different people in the Mines e-sports discord. Hopping in a call just to hang out and have actual conversations with people every two or three days has been somewhat of a savior for my mental health. Also, I'm not sure if this is possible for you, but over some of the weekends I drive home to have dinner with my family. Getting non school-related contact with new people is crucial, so also watch for campus events or even those happening over zoom if you just wanna talk to new people.",

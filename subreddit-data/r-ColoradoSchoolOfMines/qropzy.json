Should I email professors who\u2019s research or class content interests me?\n\nI\u2019m really excited to see the school in person! Any advice is greatly appreciated.",

            "comment": "If you're looking at Mines as a graduate program I highly recommend emailing professors ahead of time who do research that interests you. If your coming as an undergraduate student it's not a bad idea either if research is something that interests you. There's a lot of opportunities for undergraduate research and showing interest early is going to be a good way to find those opportunities once you arrive.\n\nIf you have time, take a walk from campus down to Washington Ave. It's where most of the local shops and restaurants are located. It'll give you a good feeling for the Vibe of Golden and what's around the school.\n\nIf you have a car it could be nice to take a drive up Mt. Zion. It's the mountain overlooking campus (there's a big white 'M' on it) and there's places along the road to stop and get a good view. It's very pretty even after the leaves had dropped. Hopefully you get a sunny day!\n\nThe campus isn't super big and you can walk pretty much everywhere. Rather than looking for something specific, wander around the campus. Do stop by the building where the department your interested in is located. That's the building you'll end up spending a lot of time in. \n\nI'm relatively new as a grad student so my point of view is probably very different from undergrads. That's my two cents though!",

They serve breakfast from 7-10:30am and you won\u2019t regret it, they have the best breakfast burritos you\u2019ll ever taste. If you\u2019re staying the full day then go to bob\u2019s atomic burgers for lunch and woody\u2019s wood-fired pizza for dinner, they are famous for their all you can eat pizza buffet.\n\nAnd definitely take a drive up lookout mtn road at sunset, I bike up it every night and the scenery is incredible, you will see all of Golden, north and south table mountain and Denver in the distance.",

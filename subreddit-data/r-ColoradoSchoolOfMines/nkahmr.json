    "postText": "Hello all, I'm a prospective grad student, just got accepted into the CS Bridge program and was wondering if anyone else here has been through it.\n\nI'm mostly wondering about how the first year went, the \"undergrad\" year. Was it overwhelming? Reassuring? Did it feel like undergrad again, or did it feel different? How was the transition from \"undergrad\" into a graduate program? What was it like working with the program coordinator? Where have CS Bridge students ended up after completing the program?\n\nThanks!",

I took two undergrad classes and one grad class, and even with online learning it has been positive, yes there is a lot to catch up on but doable. With grad level classes they feel more intense, in my opinion that\u2019s because of assumption of knowledge and general work ethic of students. \nI\u2019m taking another class during summer, feel free to PM I\u2019m happy to chat!",

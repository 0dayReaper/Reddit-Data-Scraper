The team isn\u2019t super\nCompetitive I know they have tryouts and there is always a few who don\u2019t make the team. The games  are a ton of fun and recently the school has been showing up to support.",

The team trys to qualify for regionals and nationals every year, but know that academics come first. \n\nMy recommendation would be to go to tryouts to see if the vibe is for you. At least while I was there, and the guys who coached the team the last couple years were those I played with, the expectation was to show up to practice and try to win as many games as possible. However, every player knew they weren't NHL bound so we just tried to have as much fun as possible. I still talk to most of the guys I played with on a weekly basis. If you love hockey and want to use it as a break from the academic challenges at Mines, then this is the team for you!",

    "postText": "I'm specifically wondering about how the schools set you up for your career, and how well known they are in the engineering field. \n\nI got accepted to both, and am currently leaning towards Mines because of the project-based and hands-on learning, the engineering clubs and organizations, and the fact that the job outlook for graduating students seems to be better than a lot of other universities. However, I am fully aware that it is a LOT of work to graduate from there, and that many students struggle with their coursework. \n\nI'm touring VT right now, and am learning that they are also very well known in the industry, provide many opportunities for students to create a network and gain experience (like the co-op program). Certainly they seem to be a top-notch engineering school. Plus, the food at VT is WAY better than at Mines. I'm starting to question why I would choose Mines if VT provides a comparable education and employment opportunities, but has a better social scene and seems to be much better experience overall?",

It\u2019s a very dedicated and focused environment and a great sense of belonging. Then again I am biased because I do go to mines. During your first year, you\u2019re taking the same classes as almost everyone else in your year, this leads to substantial support and community building.",

Otherwise your money is probably best spent elsewhere.\n\nMines is mainly known in CO, and a little bit in the western states but still doesn't have huge name recognition.\n\nMines has project based classes, but they aren't great. Design 1 &amp;2 which everyone has to take are a bit of  a joke. The clubs and orgs are separate and your own thing. They really rely on leadership and people with the time and motivation to make things happen.\n\nThere is not an co-op or internship program out here. And unfortunately there isn't even a high chance that you will get an internship. Unless you have a good department with industry connections.\n\nMines seems to be a top notch school, but really they just force you to teach yourself everything. It's what makes Mines students desirable, if a company treats you even slightly as a human it's tons better than the nicest week here.\n\nWith a quick look at tuition and everything else, I would pick VT. If you are out of state for both it should be significantly cheaper. Unless you are dead set on the Rockies.",

Also keep in mind that CO has a high cost of living.\n\nThe Rockies are really nice, and large amounts of public land is a huge plus. You just have to decided if Mines is decent enough for you to come here.",

Even though Blacksburg is pretty far from DC metro it is easy enough to make connections to the metro area. DC metro is absolutely amazing and yes I\u2019m biased but mechanical engineers are needed in the many biotech operations out in Maryland to assist with medical equipment as well as needed in government of which there is a lot of in Virginia. That is in addition to the regular private sector. From what my friend tells me about Mines it is a more rigorous and perhaps more academic focused school. You will also make connections in a different area of the country so if you want to live in Denver it\u2019s a good move. It\u2019s worth considering though that Denver metro is smaller than DC metro with inevitably fewer internship opportunities. Really you just have to think about where you see yourself long term.",

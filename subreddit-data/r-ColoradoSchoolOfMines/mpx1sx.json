My husband is on a 7/9/11/12 ladder which means each year after graduation he gets a promotion if things go well. The pay for those is $48k/$58k/$70k/$84k. For reference, my first long term job out of school I started at $55k and five years later I was at $65k \n\nYou may know this, just want to explain government pay for anyone else that's curious! Doesn't take away from your main point about the median salary. I took on too many loans because I was expecting to get a job with $75k right out of school. So silly of me.",

I graduated in 2012 and civil doesn't pay great and geotech is the cheapest of those, so yep that is where I went. I do get to be home now unlike when I was working up in Wyoming as a site geologist for an oil field, so the pay cut was worth it.",

Have time dedicated to homework, class, studying, but also cooking, sleeping, movie night. It was easier for me to study knowing I had a set time for fun later...and I could enjoy the fun knowing I had put in a solid study session.\n\nIf you are struggling with mental health, reach out for counseling and/or medication.

Your brain needs time to relax and have fun, so following a schedule like the person I'm replying to suggests is a really good idea. Also, make sure to have a good sleep schedule!! There were so many times I'd talk to classmates on exam days and they'd say they got no sleep due to studying, and they'd later be disappointed in the grade they got. It's way better to study for a few hours and actually sleep than to study all night and try to drag your brain through an exam. Mines isn't a competition for who can be the most miserable, enjoy yourself and do your best!",

I came back for my senior year. \n\n2) Humble thyself - Mines is go-go-go, perform-perform-perform, compete-compete-compete. Once you get a job, you are part of a team. Yeah you have a Mines degree but to the average joe you may be working with or learning from, that doesn\u2019t mean shit. In fact, they may assume you are a know it all and aren\u2019t teachable. Ask lots of questions and invest in your relationships with your coworkers. You got the job, do your job well and you\u2019ll be fine. Part of doing the job though is being a good team player and I don\u2019t thing mines (or any college) does a good job in that because you are competing within your own team a lot and the workplace is not like that.",

It has worked well to let people know we aren't super human freaks, we just put lots of effort into college at the detriment off some of the social aspects.

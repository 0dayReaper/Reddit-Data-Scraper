No shame in it. But as long as you stay on top of what classes you need to take now for prereqs you can plan ahead and graduate on time but be ready to take more classes and have a lower gpa. If I had taken an extra year I could have put more energy into classes senior year and gotten better grades. Do what\u2019s best for you and especially your mental health.",

I was even suspended a semester for being an idiot in class. That said, I\u2019ve had a stable, successful career since then. FWIW, I got accepted into Rice, UT, and Carnegie Melon for graduate school as well. Mines is well known in academia!",

            "comment": "The only class I withdrew from was a summer LAIS course. The Prof imo was a sexist piece of shit. He told a gal from Kuwait that she \"obviously had wrong views\" because her description of Kuwait didn't match up with he thought of the country. Then proceeded to hound her about why she wasn't wearing a hijab and then proceeded to speak over her saying she was wrong about her own country. And then proceeded the next class to ignore her and only call on the boys and straight up rolled his eyes while she was talking.\n\nThen, I had a family funeral that was unexpected, told him hey I have to miss a class and know this assignment is due, can I turn it in early. Well apparently after I turned it in, the class I missed he CHANGED the criteria and what I was supposed to write about (it was like 10% of the grade too!!!) And when I heard about it, I told him, I'm not in the state but can update what I submitted - and resubmit it. He told me \"no you have to submit it in person\" knowing FULL well I was out of the fucking state. \n\nSo I said fuck it and had my friend give him the withdrawal form. Didn't affect any of my jobs or transcripts. I wouldn't withdraw unless you know for certain you'll fail the course, and even then if there's a chance you'll pass I'd stick it out. GPA only matters for your first job and 90% of jobs won't ask about your GPA. I'd concentrate more on making connections over having a stellar gpa but I also stick to the D's get degrees.",

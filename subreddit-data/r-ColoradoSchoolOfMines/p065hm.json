    "postText": "Hey yall! I\u2019m thinking about transferring to school of mines for chemE and I\u2019m really interested in genetics and pharmacology. I got into the biological engineering track, and I saw that genetics and pharmacology are both classes offered. I\u2019m just wondering if anyone knows how effective this degree would be for going into one of those fields (especially for research)? Any advice is helpful! For reference, I\u2019m coming out of a genetics program out of my current school, it\u2019s just too far from home :/",

I\u2019ve taken most of my classes with people on the bio track; the only time it really diverges is in technical electives at the end of your degree. You\u2019ll have to take a unit ops field session, which is absolutely god-awful for chem e. Field session for other majors is fairly manageable. \n\nOverall, if you\u2019re not set on being a chemical engineer, I would *not* join this major. It\u2019s pretty miserable.",

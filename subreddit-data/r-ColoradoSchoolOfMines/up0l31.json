    "postText": "I am sick of paying for the storage Unit, and would like to offer, the unit to you, or your crew for free. Ideally for a student whom appreciates minerals and amateur mining. The unit has a good amount of stuff for a student or transplant whom needs inexpensive items to start out in Colorado. I am currently out of state, and will be for the forseeable future. I have had this storage unit for what will be the 3rd year in October. I will end up mailing you the key and access information to the storage unit, which is located just off of route 36 in Westminster, fairly close to the 1stBank Center.\n\n5'x5' storage unit contents available, for free. I just ask that you respect the facility property and have a desire to remove most of the items within.\n\nItems include used clothing-Osprey Backpack-Several Pieces of Luggage-Good Condition Queen Mattress - Quilt and Comforter as well.-Numerous Minerals at least 25 pounds of petrified wood. Some fossilized bivalves and single-celled coral. Coral and Coral Spores from Pacific-side Mexico....So on, So on.-Used Camping Gear-Various amateur mining gear-3 acoustic guitars-Numerous Literature-Concert Art/Posters\n\nI can pay for the storage unit a maximum of 2 or 3 additional months to give you time to remove the items. As was said prior, after we arrange in your intention, and to ideally remove and use the belongings, I will send you the key in the mail, with access code information and such for the facility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I guess it would have helped if my DM's and chat were enabled. They are now. Apologies if anyone was trying to reach me via those. Also, not calling any of you amateur's, it is I whom the amateur is, looking to pass this gear off to a pro :)",

So there would need to be a third party involved in sorting out what would be of acceptable quality for the museum and such. I will have to research and dig around for their policy. Thanks for the idea!",

I've had students upset with their final grades but no one has ever gone through the full appeal process with me, but the first step in the process is to contact the professor and explain why you feel the grade is too low.  It is best to write out your case in an email. When I receive an email like this, I will carefully consider what the student has to say and then either respond with my reasoning on why the grade is fair, or if I feel the student has a good case I'll regrade their work and then file a grade change with the registrar.  I've always been able to resolve grade disagreements after this dialogue and I've never had a case escalate further. \n\nWhen you write your case to the professor, avoid making an emotional argument and stick to the facts of why you think your final grade was unfair.  Be prepared that the professor may not agree with you and be prepared to hear some critical feedback.  If after carefully considering the professor's feedback you still feel the grade is unfair you can escalate to the full appeal process.  At that point you'll have already gotten the required materials in writing from your dialogue with the professor.  \n\nI don't have statistics on how many appeals are successful but I do know Mines usually backs up the professor and you have to have a really good case to have the grade overturned.  I've been told by other faculty the success rate of appeals at Mines is much lower than that of CU, if that helps put things into perspective.",

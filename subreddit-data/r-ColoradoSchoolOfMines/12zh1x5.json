    "postText": "Hi, I earned a 5 on the Calc AB exam and also expecting a 5 on BC next month, which means I get credit for Calc 1&amp;2 at Mines. \n\nAny recommendations on starting with Calc 2 or Calc 3?  I'm worried about missing foundational knowledge and/or getting in over my head for my first semester.",

Everyone I knew that got 5s but took calc II again severely regretted it. \n\nYour mileage may vary, but generally 2 is the hardest from what I gather. I started with 3 and it worked well for me.\n\nedit: I will also add that taking the credit now means that you can probably lighten your course load once classes get tough",

They make the first 2 calc classes here needlessly difficult, and if you got a 5 on both exams then you understand the material. \n\nAs far as material you might miss, the only big thing I remember not knowing in calc 3 was vector properties and parameterization. I ended up reading about the topics online for a few days straight to catch up, but the math teachers here are generally very nice, and you could easily go to your calc 3 teacher when the topic comes up to get it explained. I was extremely stubborn about asking for help and it made my life so much more difficult, so just don't be like me and you'll be fine.",

I took the 5 from BC and placed into calc 3 last semester, and that helps looking forward with credit load. also, they got rid of the calc 2 short form so you don\u2019t have to take that, calc 3 has some intro stuff and optional review materials in case you missed content.\nedit: also, if you turn down the calc 2 credit I\u2019m not sure if you get those hours counted as transfer credits from AP. having transfer credits helps you register earlier and stay on track / ahead for graduation.",

It\u2019s still the only class I\u2019ve ever failed in my life. If you do plan on starting with calc 3 just make sure you\u2019re ready for it and realize mines classes will probably be harder than your high school.",

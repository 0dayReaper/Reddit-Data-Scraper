            "comment": "Ohhhhhhhhh boy... Strap in because I had a hell of a ride.  \n\nI graduated with a 2.35 GPA in CS in 2018 while interning at this small healthcare firm for about the last 8 months of my undergrad time. The job wasn't super fulfilling (very \"code monkey\", less software engineer) so after about 9 months full time I began looking around for something that I thought at the time was more fulfilling. After interviewing and being convinced of their \"highly collaborative and growth promoting\" environment, I got offered a job that was a 25% above my salary at the time so being a young engineer, I snapped it up and changed. Well, that environment I was sold on was a crock of shit, I got all but locked in a cube, told \"do these coding challenges as your training\", and to report back when done. I was miserable...  \n\nSo about a month and a half in, after having my issues falling on deaf ears, I walked out. I went back and got my masters degree in ETM on the recommendation of the career center (basically the only good advice I ever got from them...) and then I graduated with flying colors (3.74) in May of 2020.  \n\nNow, after being offered a dozen or so coding jobs that I knew I'd hate and being unemployed for 4 months, I got a job as an aerospace software QA engineer because the manager was \"looking for a CS major that didn't really like coding and was good with people\". I've was at that job for close to 2 years and I didn't feel the direct need to move so I eventually just opened up my search to recruiters, but was content with my job so I turned down a lot of interview requests.  \n\nThat was, until 6 months ago when someone reached out to me about being a Sales Engineer. I had originally looked at being an SE when I was doing my search when I was finishing up my master's but from what I gathered, it wasn't easy to get as a semi-entry level position. A huge raise came as a result and now I'm super happy with my job.  \n\nTL;DR:    \nSoftware Engineer &gt; Software QA &gt; Sales Engineer",

I'm a software engineer in aerospace and while I don't feel like a code monkey, it can get pretty dry at times. Things are also very fast-paced due to the nature of the aerospace industry. Overall, I like it but I'm not planning on staying more than 2 years. I can tell that if I stay too long it would start to wear down on me.\n\nAnyway, when I started college I was a MechE and wanted to design roller coasters (I know)... Quickly changed my mind to pursue a more lucrative major with higher job security, and that was one of the best decisions I ever made. Even though it took me 7 years to get through undergrad (including a 1-year break), it was worth it to get here. I'm starting to think about where to go next, so reading your comment was helpful.\n\nEventually though, I'd like to work in the arts, particularly music. There are a few routes I can already see leading there, but I need some more time to evaluate my options.",

I had an opportunity to intern for a year in Germany as a civil engineer for three separate companies - and the ONLY thing I enjoyed was underground work for the city of Lahr.  \nOnce I got to Mines, I took an Earth Science class and decided to switch to Mining Engineering because I loved geology and loved being underground.  I interned all through college at an underground coal mine with BHP and thought I had my life lined out.  \nI graduated in 2015.  Less than four months after starting at the mine, it sold to Westmoreland, who quickly laid off half the workers.  Including me.  \nI tried the quarry life and lasted nine months.  I was miserable, untrained, and lost.  I hired on to an underground civil / tunneling company in 2017 and moved to DC.  I\u2019m with my third company in DC now, still working with a lot of the same people and very content with how my life worked out.  \nI have passed my PE in Civil Construction and applied with Virginia.  I work for a large but family owned construction company specialized in industrial and heavy civil work.  I still do a lot with tunnels, shafts, and near surface structures, as well as building and refurbishing water treatment facilities.  I\u2019ve stayed focused on the structural (concrete/SOE/steel) components of these projects and do well for myself.  I get to live in Washington DC, which I love, and challenge myself with new projects and job sites.  \nI\u2019m very happy with how my life turned out, and I have to say my time at Mines definitely shaped my approach and geared my success.

    "postText": "Hello again. As you may know, the Senior Design sequence isn't required for CS majors. However, should one take both courses in the sequence, they will count towards CS electives (rather than free electives).\n\nMeaningful design is something that I personally find fascinating, and since we as CS majors already get a taste of client-driven design in our field session, I'd love to see if taking it in the future would be a fulfilling experience.\n\nI am seeking to hear about the experiences of CS majors who took the Senior Design sequence, as well as from others who've seen the experiences of CS majors in it. What exactly did Senior Design entail for you, did you enjoy it, and would you recommend it?",

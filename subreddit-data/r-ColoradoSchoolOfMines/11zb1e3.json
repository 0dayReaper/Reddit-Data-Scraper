They've all been to \"low-key\"/professional is the best way I can describe it. What clubs have a more high-energy, fast paced vibe? I'm not really interested in athletic clubs.",

The only thing fast paced is going to be Greek Life at times (fundraising, recruiting, volunteering, etc.) and outdoor clubs like Cross Country Skiing and such.",

I'm sure you know, but some clubs are inherently professional and drab, like professional organizations/societies, and some of the project-oriented clubs. But those which are more hobby-oriented will obviously be more casual and \"anything goes\". Have you mostly stuck to the professional/project clubs?",

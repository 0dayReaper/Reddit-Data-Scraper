            "comment": "you can\u2019t add munch money, but you can purchase the SoGo cards in smaller increments if you run out. Munch money is great for grab and go at Elements, or if you want a more substantial meal at QDoba or WOW. You can also use it at Starbucks and Einstein\u2019s if you\u2019re a caffeine fiend. Zime has some pretty good drink and food options, and that\u2019s the late night option. I\u2019m not a huge Mines Market fan, so Munch Money is a good option if you want non-dining hall food. \n\nAlso, hopefully y\u2019all get meal exchanges next year bcs if you maximize those they can be worth $10-$15 each, which means you spend less munch money.",

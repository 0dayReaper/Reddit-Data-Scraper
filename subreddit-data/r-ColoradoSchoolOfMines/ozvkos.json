We don\u2019t have anyone with any experience with the program yet and we definitely don\u2019t know anything about the outcome as there\u2019s no alumni. Mines is not known for their spectacular economics department/program though and that should give you at least a rough idea on what business will be like",

I\u2019ve been doing the cs+business track and I\u2019m going into my last semester of undergrad. I\u2019ve really enjoyed it and have gotten to take economics courses that I\u2019ve found very interesting. I will say it has nothing to do with the job I\u2019ve got lined up post grad and I\u2019m doing my masters in general CS. I think it\u2019s a good program if you don\u2019t have a specialized area of CS you\u2019re pursuing and are interested in economics. If what you want is to work in the business side of cs your best bet is to do a cs undergrad and then mba afterwards like someone else mentioned. Lemme know if you have any other wuestions",

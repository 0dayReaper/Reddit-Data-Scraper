There\u2019s a glass science course Gorman is offering this coming semester which shouldn\u2019t be too bad. Mech props of ceramics is also nice. \n\nIf you\u2019re including fall semester, electron microscopy and solidification are both stupid easy",

By any chance, have you heard about Computational Materials with Stevanovic? It sounded interesting too but I worry about the work load",

Engineering alloys with Yu was an absolute blast and super helpful, but some work to stay ahead. Lowe is teaching it next semester,  so it\u2019ll likely be a bit more chill.",

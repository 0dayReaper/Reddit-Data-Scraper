Elevator in Meyer Hall before it was always broken too. \n\nFeel sorry for Barbra, she always lamented that they would rebuild the building but keep the old elevator in place to save on cost. New one isn\u2019t doing much better. It was broken the first time I visited the new building too. \n\nWonder how many times Dr. Ohno has gotten stuck in the new one\u2026",

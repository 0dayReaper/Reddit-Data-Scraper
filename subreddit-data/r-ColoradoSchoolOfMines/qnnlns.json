    "postText": "Alright, so earlier there was a post about this.  And it generated a lot of really great discussion.  Unfortunately, it also contained some pretty serious... let's call them misinterpretations of the information available.  So here's a version with all the same resources and data.  Let's talk.\n\n---\n\nhttps://minesparkredevelopment.com/\n\nAn email went out that the school is planning to demolish mines park in order to renovate and more than double the number of beds. We've looked at https://www.mines.edu/masterplan/ and it seems that they have a long-term goal of increasing the student body and reaching 100 million in funded research. Students will be feeling this construction in mines park Summer of 2022-2024. The destruction of the commuter lot off of Washington was another part of the expansion plan. In addition to 1750 Jackson, the proposed expansions include ALL of the parking lots in front of the CTLM. The plan appears to include two new parking garages, one by CTLM and one behind Green Center\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the expansion? Are you for or against the increases in students and facilities?  What concerns do you have?\n\nThis is the community meeting about the Mines Park project. Please attend to express your opinions!\n\n    Monday, November 8th at 6 pm in Community Center II.\n    Or Zoom: Join from PC, Mac, Linux, iOS or Android: https://mines.zoom.us/j/96852864792?pwd=d2cxQmtGRWcyNDk2akVUaFBWV0ZMdz09\n\n               Password: 627717\n\n---\n\n#Corrections from post one: \n\n***The planned increase to the student body is 13% over the next three years***\n\n***Parking garages are being built next to CTLM and behind Green center, which I'm pretty sure will be a net increase.***",

            "comment": "Copy-pasting my comment from the original thread:\n\nIn a grand sense, it's great that Mines is capitalizing on its reputation that has been getting more widely recognized in recent years.\n\nHowever at a student level, I'm worried that they aren't taking into account how these changes will affect student life. For me, this school is becoming unrecognizable from when I came in as a freshman in 2015. If I was a HS senior applying to colleges today, I think the chance of me choosing Mines would be much lower. Especially as a student who bore the brunt of the growing pains that came with the expansions, the unique atmosphere that initially drew me to Mines in the first place, is almost completely gone. It feels corporatized and lifeless compared to a few years ago.\n\nThe thing that worries me the most about this plan is that there seems to be comparatively little to no investment in student life and mental health. Sure, by 2030 the campus will all be nice and shiny but what does that mean on an internal, personal level? If they can't address the mental health crisis that has been ravaging Mines head on, I see no reason to buy into these proposed changes.\n\nBut yeah it looks great on paper I guess",

                            "comment": "I decided on Mines after I toured the campus in Spring 2015. At that point, it felt more \"old school\" and much smaller. They hadn't yet hired PCJ as president (not to knock the guy, he's great), and many of the buildings that exist today hadn't even begun construction. Hell, some old buildings were still standing. Everything felt tight-knit, like a community where everyone knew everybody else. \n\nI knew a couple of older students who recommended Mines to me because they knew I wanted to go to a smaller, \"homier\" school. I also wanted a challenging school, which to be fair is something that hasn't changed.\n\nWell, I got most of that my freshman year, but then things started to change. My department more than doubled in size, and the school had no idea what to do with us. Classic college-style brick lecture buildings were demolished or renovated to build modern glass and steel ones. Mines Market was forced on us as the only affordable food option.\n\nIt doesn't help either that Golden has changed as well. It went from being a fairly accommodating college-vibe town, to a yuppie-fied tourist destination where almost everything is overpriced. Many students are priced out of Golden and are forced to live in other cities, because they're the only places they can afford. \n\nI'm not saying this to discourage you. Tons of students younger than me love Mines, and they love what it has to offer. Maybe I'm being a crotchety old man whining about how things used to be, but this is my truth, and I don't see it very often on this sub. I still believe 100% that Mines is a fantastic university, and that if you can motivate yourself to get through it, you absolutely should. I've made some lifelong memories here, even if the school has its weaknesses.\n\nI've said enough at this point. Hopefully campus life will be more stable in the coming years than when I was here, and I wish you the best of luck making your decision. Take care",

Every CS professor I've talked to has been outspoken about how little the school has done for them even though they've grown so rapidly in the past few years.\n\nIt took more than a couple years for the university to recognize that CS grew as rapidly as it did, and in those years, everything was extremely disorganized, which made life harder for both CS students and CS faculty. To this day, we still don't have a designated building even though CS is the 2nd largest major at Mines. The best we have to show for it is the 2nd floor computer lab of CTLM, and a small portion of the old side of Brown. Alamode lab is a consolation at best, and it isn't well taken care of. The last time I was there, it smelled like old pastrami and B.O. CS students who have no choice but to learn and code on campus deserve better.\n\nMost CS classes are taught in Marquez, which Mines built during a petro boom, and designated as the Petroleum Engineering building. But now that oil &amp; gas is experiencing a decline with fewer students entering PE, the best they can do is funnel CS classes into that building, because they don't know where else to put us. The Mines CS department is hilariously fragmented across campus and there has been little effort to consolidate it into the cohesive community that many other majors benefit from.",

I didn't mean to imply it was their fault, just that growing like that is always going to be a problem, but that's particularly bad handling from the school.\n\nThough I thought that physical fragmentation was normal (undergrad civil).  We nominally have part of two buildings (Chauvenet and Coolbaugh), but our classes were still all over the place--lots of Marquez and Berthoud, some Coolbaugh.  Our faculty are pretty much all in the same place but our classes definitely weren't.",

And that's obviously concerning, given they want to budget money towards expansion but I still have to haggle my schedule every year because the registrar is in a constant state of flux and the department doesn't have enough professors to teach my required classes.\n\nMines has given us now more of CTLM but at the cost of removing us more from Brown. I wouldn't say they gave us any more space, they just moved us so we share less buildings with other departments.\n\nThe above comment also doesn't mention that many of our classes are taught by Graduate students, sometimes not even with an overseeing professor. I don't know how similar this is for other degrees, but it's concerning given how much tuition costs that we don't have professors to teach even over half the classes in our discipline. (Seriously, my experience has been that a solid amount (30-40%) of my CS specific courses at ALL levels have been taught by graduate students. (Some of which were not qualified to teach the class) Issues like this make it very hard to know if students are legitimately struggling in the curriculum, or are being so poorly mismanaged it's hurting grades and college experiences.",

I don\u2019t see anywhere listed in this that calls for an expansion to the health center and it\u2019s services.  I think the health center only being open on the weekdays and then closing pretty early isn\u2019t grand.  Wish there was a way to hire more staff for the weekends at least.  And don\u2019t even get me started on their \u201cmental health\u201d services.  That\u2019s still one of the biggest issues.  While I like that they are wanting to expand academic spaces and hire more teaching staff, is this going to fix the issues with Registrar and how they can\u2019t keep staff?  Is scheduling for students going to be fixed (mostly talking about the nightmare that is finding 300/400 HASS).  This plan also leaves out something that REALLY concerns me, non-academic student spaces.  And what I mean by that is, spaces for relaxing, playing games, watching movies, club storage spaces, more dinning options, spaces dedicated for extracurricular activities.  I did see they want to allocate spaces for parks and green spaces, but this schools social issues stem partly from a less than vibrant campus life.  Mines admin really needs a fixer upper on SAIL and BSO.  \n\nTLDR: I want Mines to succeed, but I don\u2019t think new shiny buildings are going to be our saving grace.  The internal issues need to be resolved first.",

Mines was much more \"engineering for engineering\" to me, but I also switched majors in the process (CS to civil), so that's a confounding variable.\n\nTransferring turned out to be a very good decision for me, but whether that generalizes depends on why you want to.",

They\u2019re focusing more on the arts and giving less support for the tech programs they\u2019re known for. Everyone is required to take a 3 class liberal arts immersion, regardless of interest. I get it- well rounded students and all- but I\u2019m going to school for engineering, not sports or arts or whatever.\n\nI\u2019m looking at Mines because 1) it\u2019s literally at the base of the Rockies and I\u2019m an outdoor nut 2) it appears to be what my current school was advertised as- nerdy, specialized, committed to engineering, solid support for academics, and not trying to be something it\u2019s not 3) has classes and electives I\u2019m actually interested in and 4) has solid support for the maker community",

If you\u2019re trying to stay in Massachusetts long term, you\u2019d probably be better off somewhere in the northeast (I toured WPI and remember being impressed). If you go to mines you can expect to be employed in the Rocky Mountain area, Texas, and maybe the Midwest. My roommate last year was from the northeast as well and I\u2019ve gathered that mines isn\u2019t really known. He\u2019s trying to set up life in this general part of the country, though. This is really what this new initiative is trying to change. More students and research funds would mean more publicity. If you dig enough through the career center website, you can find data on where students end up. My guess would be Massachusetts is pretty rare.",

It\u2019s not always sunshine in rainbows and there are weeks that totally suck, but that\u2019s just what engineering is. Any decent engineering program is going to be challenging.",

The average person will talk to many multiple companies and never hear anything back from them. Thats whats common. \n\nHave you had the experience of trying to reach out to faculty for help and they tell you you're an idiot? I've had that happen, though thankfully that professor is gone and will not be returning. But most others still aren't that willing to help.\n\nWhat kind of new skills have you learned? Because if you are talking about how to use a screwdriver or how to solder, those are not skills you need to go to college for. Unfortunately I've seen students learning those skills before. \n\nI expected rough times coming in. But a school that doesn't care about you doesn't help anything.",

I guess there isn\u2019t really a way to prove I didn\u2019t know anyone, but I didn\u2019t (if you can think of a way for me to prove it to you, lmk). Not every internship is a product of knowing a guy - with a ton of work and maybe a bit of luck, it just worked out. I researched career fair extensively, had about 30 companies I wanted to talk to. I talked to maybe 12 of them and applied to 8 or so internships. My guess would be this is a lot more than most sophomores do at least. The company I\u2019ll be with is relatively small, based in the Midwest (not my homestate or CO), but had an office near my hometown who was hiring, and just got back to me first. I\u2019ve turned down 2 interviews from other companies since then(1 of which was a second round interview). The most consistent advice for career day is to talk to as MANY companies as possible in order to increase your chances/stumble onto an opportunity and that\u2019s what happened. There definitely exists faculty that shouldn\u2019t be here. I\u2019ve been lucky enough to not really encounter that so far. Bad bosses and bad teachers are a part of life unfortunately but it seems that the majority consensus is that the faculty here is great. I can\u2019t speak for MechE, who I will admit I\u2019ve heard bad things about.\n\nIf I went into detail about the skills Ive learned I\u2019d risk doxxing myself as I learned most of these in a relatively small but well known club/organization and have said enough about myself - but the main one is that I was able to pick up Revit pretty well which definitely contributed to my career fair prospects. Beyond that, I\u2019ve learned a lot in construction, particularly code compliance and residential electricity. I may not have to be in college to learn this things but where else am I to learn it without delaying my education? This was something I sought out as I heard it could be useful and I want to be knowledgeable when I hopefully own a home one day. Like any college, mines is what you make of it and I\u2019ve just been really focused on getting everything I possibly can out of this school. It\u2019s not always easy, but it\u2019s been more than rewarding and likely wouldn\u2019t have happened at most other schools.",

            "comment": "I live in mines park and eat all my meals at mines market to save time. And since the rover permit got revoked, that means walking to and from campus at least twice per day. I think I speak for everyone who lives up here when I say that dining services and a gym would be absolutely HUGE. I\u2019m willing to put up with whatever construction is needed to create a \u201cmines park market\u201d or a \u201cmines park motion lab\u201d. Seems long overdue.\n\nAnd yes, additional beds totally makes sense, especially if it could lower the rent and allow more undergrads to actually live at mines. I\u2019ve talked to so many people who say they moved off campus 10-15min away for cheaper living which makes it harder to get together and study or recreate, not to mention the freezing snowy drives or the fear that you won\u2019t find a spot and miss class. Sure, off-campus will always be slightly cheaper, but even a tiny cost-reduction for mines park could be the difference between on/off campus for hundreds of us.\n\nAnd speaking of parking, mines is extremely far behind with their EV charging network. Before coming here I visited other schools that had an entire side of the parking lot devoted to 100% EV spaces, 15-20 chargers per lot, around 60 total. For an institution that advertises \u201cEarth Energy and Environment\u201d, it really makes us look bad to only have 6 chargers on campus. I\u2019m hoping this new project will bring an extra 20-30 stations, one per building in mines park, on a shared network with blastercard activation. If we can run electric autonomous shuttles then we sure as hell can provide the infrastructure for EVs and PHEVs.\n\nOverall im definitely looking forward to this project, let\u2019s bring it on and see what we can do",

A rather ridiculous rule. \n\nWhy would you ever choose to eat at Mines Market? It is ridiculously overpriced, especially for the quality of food served. You could go almost anywhere else in Golden to eat and save money. \n\nMines won't lower rent in their housing. Its already been established that students will pay their ludicrous prices so why would they lower them? I moved out of mines Park to a place closer to campus and immediately saved $200 a month.\n\nDon't think you speak for everyone if you advocate for overpriced, poor food. Its in really bad taste.",

We all know mines market is run by sodexo and serves the cheapest stuff they can to make a profit, so low quality is kind of a given. And yes I\u2019ve been to all the local places- bobs woodys bonfire... The only reason I still eat mm is because it\u2019s convenient and saves time. For ~10 bucks you can be in and out in 15 minutes with a meal that you don\u2019t have to shop for, prepare, cook or clean, and you don\u2019t have to order or wait in line. I\u2019m awful at cooking and the time it would take to whip up something higher quality would be nearly double or triple the time I spend in mm. Nearly all the golden restaurants close at 8, and I\u2019ve walked into mm at 9:59pm and still gotten a half decent meal. I know many people in mines park who have a commuter meal plan for this exact reason. Yes, good food is good and I enjoy plenty of it back home, but I don\u2019t mind sacrificing taste for convenience, and a mines market-like cafeteria in mines park would help with late night productivity without the hassle.\n\nI\u2019ve got 2-3 more years left here and I plan to stay in mines park and see how this project plays out.

Barring the unlimited plan if you went 4 times a day. Although I don't believe they have an unlimited anymore. \n\nIf you felt like it you could easily get the same level of quality food for a lot cheaper and minimal time. For lunches a good sandwich is all that you really need and takes maybe 5 minutes to prepare at home.\n\nFor dinner there are plenty of frozen options, just like sodexos food, that can be tossed in the oven and then you go back to work while its cooking. Or get stuff like hamburger helper, it may take a little longer but its worth it.\n\nCooking serves many purposes,  it let's you take a much needed break from studying, it will be better food and you have to do it to get better at it. A good frying pan will do the majority of what you need, either go with a modern non-stick, the copper ones work great. Or go with cast iron, the cast iron takes a little more work to maintain but I think it gives better results. \n\nIf you're only here 2-3 more years you are unlikely to see many if any benefits from a mines Park project. The school is notorious for hiring very slow contractors. For example theres a project right now that there was a ground breaking ceremony for a few months ago. There has been absolutely no work done on it. Also, being part of Mines master plan doesn't guarantee that anything will be built. There some items that have been on there 20-30 years that haven't been done.\n\nI would also highly recommend that you move out of mines Park. I made the mistake of living there for one year. I now live closer, pay significantly less and don't have to deal with Mines for my housing. An added bonus is that where I live I don't even have to bother with the non-autonomous rovers, that cost a half million that could have been used for something useful.",

I live in mines park and I eat breakfast at MM most days and it\u2019s pretty solid. $760 for 80 meal swipes and $240 munch money breaks down to $6.5 per meal swipe which is very reasonable. I also get my fruit for the day from MM and if you take advantage of what they have, it\u2019s more than worth it. Unless you have dietary restrictions or are extremely picky, MM will almost always have something and you can check ahead on the Bite app to see what\u2019s being served.\n\n3) mines park isn\u2019t cheap but I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth it considering the alternatives. I don\u2019t have to drive to school, which means I don\u2019t need to buy a parking pass. Mines park does a 10 month lease, while most other places do 12 month leases.

So, no need for a parking pass. I save about $200 a month from when I lived there, and I'm fairly certain rent has only gone up there. By saving that much over the ten month period is $2,000 that pays for the last 2 months of a 12 month lease and saves money still. My utilities do come to a little bit more than yours, but that's primarily due to internet. Not having to deal with mines bureaucracy is also a huge perk. Overall, I definitely save money.",

This was more of a convenience decision rather than a financial one. Is saving a hundred bucks worth having to deal with one more meal everyday for an entire semester? For me, no. Less shopping trips, more sleep, and a mostly decent care-free meal almost every day. I mainly spend my money at Wow and elements and it isn\u2019t cheap but I wouldn\u2019t call it unreasonable. You can get a really solid meal from wow for ~$7 and elements has a nice selection of snacks and drinks. When the alternative is walking down to Safeway and back up the hill, yeah I\u2019ll pay an extra $0.50 to $1.00 to get it from elements and have more time in my day.\n\nMines park wasn\u2019t my first choice but things fell through mid spring and it worked out pretty well for me. Better/cheaper places exist but housing in Golden can be cut-throat if you aren\u2019t on top of it. A lot of people just want to apply and not have to worry about a house hunt, and mines park fills that roll pretty reasonably. \n\nYou just mentioned your utilities are more than mine so I\u2019m not sure what happened there but only  paying for electricity and negligible gas is nice when the alternative is electricity, water, gas, and (probably worse the mines park) internet.",

                    "comment": "  \nThe \"external reputation\" of a school is basically  \nthe only reason for choosing it. I am going to college to get a good job when I  \ngraduate, end of story. If the reputation of my school can't help with that,  \nthen it is of no value for me to go there. I don't care about student  \nfacilities/organizations, the \"college experience\", or any of that  \ngarbage. Mines was talked up to the sky by my first advisor in community  \ncollege (who is a Mines alum), but when I finally got here in 2019 I quickly  \ncame to the realization that Mines does a great job of selling itself but  \ndoesn't really live up to the hype. In many ways I feel like I got a better  \nquality of education at the community colleges I attended than I have at Mines.  \n\u00a0  \nProbably the biggest problem is PCJ. He may have an  \nengineering degree, but he isn't an engineer as far as I'm concerned - he's a  \ncareer bureaucrat and politician. He was brought in from ASU for one reason and  \none reason only: to make the foundation more money. That's all he cares about,  \nand it shows. Before COVID he was trying to cram as many students as possible  \ninto classrooms. When the student complaint website was still up and running on  \nTrailhead, students were reporting some classes being so overfilled that they  \nhad to sit in the aisles (a violation of fire code, btw). Sure, Mines is building  \nparking lots and student housing, but what about increasing classroom space and  \nthe number of instructors? There is not a lot of available real estate on  \ncampus for them to do this even if they wanted to (which they obviously don\u2019t).  \n\u00a0  \nI have read posts on this subreddit from alums and people in  \nindustry about how there have even been times when administrators have  \nliterally walked out on them when they were trying to make recommendations or  \ntell them what they need to do to increase the value of a Mines degree to  \nemployers and industry. Talk about damaging Mines\u2019 external reputation! They  \nalso mentioned how the geophysics and mining departments have been declining  \nfor years. Mining after all is \u201cdirty\u201d and, true to form, PCJ is pushing the  \nschool towards more \u201cpolitically acceptable\u201d industries. Under his leadership the  \nschool is also becoming more \u201cwoke\u201d, which is a huge turn-off for many current  \nstudents (myself included), prospective students, and alumni. Apparently there  \nare many in the alumni association who are not at all happy with the direction  \nthat Mines has taken under PCJ\u2019s \u201cleadership\u201d.  \n\u00a0  \nThe bottom line is that Mines is an institution that is  \nresting on the laurels of its past accomplishments and hoping that it can  \nmaintain the fa\u00e7ade of its reputation and name. Part of why I came to Mines is  \nthat it was an exclusive school \u2013 the number of applicants admitted was something  \nlike 33% or 40% - which made a Mines degree more valuable. If Mines is going to  \nkeep increasing the number of students it admits then soon it will be no  \ndifferent from any other major engineering school (except perhaps in the cost  \nof tuition, which is egregious). If the administration keeps pushing the school  \nin the direction it has been, eventually the coveted silver diploma won\u2019t be  \nworth much more than the silver it is etched on. Personally, had I known what I  \nknow now about Mines, I would never have even applied to come here.",

    "postText": "The snow removal team might have campus taken care of, but the roads to get here are still sketchy af. And we haven\u2019t had a full snow day once this entire semester. Spring 2020 which was already over by now had at least 1-2 days where classes were cancelled completely for storms with much less accumulation. So if there\u2019s one time this entire winter for mines to call it quits, seems like tomorrow\u2019s the day. What do you all think?",

It\u2019s supposed to taper off overnight so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was cleared out by the morning.\n\nEdit: I stand corrected \n\nColorado School of Mines will be closed tomorrow, Monday, March 15, due to weather conditions. All in-person and remote classes and activities are canceled. Evening common exams will be rescheduled, and instructors will notify students accordingly. Mines Market will be open for on-campus residents only; all other dining services will be closed. The COVIDCheck Colorado testing site on campus will also be closed. Employees working remotely are not required to work on snow days. Please monitor the Mines website for updates.\n\nhttps://evb.gg/n#6vxxxxoqnw",

But also if it doesn\u2019t keep going through the night all the roads could be clear by morning, meaning no snow day. \n\nMy personal gut feeling is 65% chance of snow day, more likely to happen than not but I wouldn\u2019t be shocked either way.",

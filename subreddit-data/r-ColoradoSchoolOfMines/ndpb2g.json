    "postText": "I am an incoming freshman, and I was wondering whether the EGC tlc or the trads are better. I\u2019m not sure if the tlcs move every year but this year it says it is going to be in Maple hall. I would probably prefer more of the open door social dorm halls, and I was wondering if anyone could suggest which one would be better for this. I would love to hear opinions or anything that might help me get a sense of what it might be like in either of the dorms.",

Idk if I got lucky but I got a big friend group from elm and pretty much all of us are still friends 3 years later whereas I've met people that say they don't talk to anyone from their dorm days. \n\nI think it really comes down to how much you apply yourself to it, EGC was good because we also had a special freshman design class just for EGC members so everyone got pretty close",

            "comment": "If you're more interested in open door halls, the trads are definitely your best bet. I lived in the trads last year and everyone's doors were always open (even at night when it gets too warm)! Sometimes, it gets overwhelming because I need my alone time, but our floor was really close. I could send a message in our group chat, and everyone would just come over to talk.\n\nI also spent a lot of time on the EGC hall last year, so I feel like I can speak on that. It was on Elm when I was visiting a ton, but I personally hear that it changes from year to year; EGC my freshman year was consistently active, but I heard other things about EGC this year.\n\nTo summarize my experience in both halls: you can take a chance with EGC or stick with a more consistent option such as the trads. Either way, I made friends that I could depend on for any situation.",

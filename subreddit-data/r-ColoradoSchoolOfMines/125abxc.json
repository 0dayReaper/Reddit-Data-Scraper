Once this is done we're about 15 minutes into the class\n3. Do a little bit of quasi yoga stretching for 15-20 minutes\n4. Lights get turned off, everyone lays down on the yoga mat with their eyes closed for 5-10 minutes\n5. Pack up\n\nYou decide if that's too much work.",

There are parts of this class I didn't take seriously, I faked reflections on meditation exercises and journal entries. But the parts I took seriously, exercises like Worry Grids, I still use to this day. It's a good class to get the PAGN credit without worrying about the anxiety of performing physically, being exposed to others in that way, and it can be genuinely useful if you choose for it to be.",

    "postText": "I just graduated, but with the recent email from Dean Morgan, I'm a bit curious as to approximately what the death/suicide rate at Mines is. I know I've received a \"loss to the community\" email basically every semester and peers from other unis (Boulder, Anschutz, CSU, DU) jest about the high fatality of Mines. I would definitely see Mines having a higher rate than elsewhere, but is it actually \\*that\\* high?",

And it\u2019s sad that the email has the connotation amongst our community.  \n\nIn another note, maybe this is the wrong forum for this, but Sam was a blessing to the Mines community. She had the pre existing stuff, but she didn\u2019t let that stop her from the college experience. She brought joy to the people around her.  She was bright and inquisitive.  She knew how to tease you and make you feel right at home.  I\u2019m definitely going to cherish the memories I had with her, and it was a reminder to me how fragile life is, even at college age.  Tell people you love them and care about them.  You never know who you\u2019re going to impact.",

That goes to about a third of a person per year at mine's enrollment of 6600. \n\nAntecdotally it seems as though while I've been here it has probably been closer to one-ish suicide a year, which, 3x is a pretty decent amount higher than expected, but probably not quite as much as it seems is sometimes joked about",

I have a buddy who worked in housing and he said that it has gotten so bad that they stopped reporting some of the off campus stuff and the deaths that are happening all the time in Mines Park (non-student related).",

It is high, and the school understandably doesn't want to make that info public on their website. \n\nI will also say that there are several new initiatives started by the school in 2019. They are still gaining momentum and the university is really bad at sharing what's happening around campus in my opinion. \n\nShameless plug, but if you'd like to see all the school resources in one document (or as many as I could find) check out my book pinned at the top of the subreddit.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's an archived post on the subject. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ColoradoSchoolOfMines/comments/9qxkc8/suicide\\_at\\_mines/.",

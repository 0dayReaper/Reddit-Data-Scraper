Regardless, you\u2019ll want to keep your GPA off your resume and start applying as soon as possible. Applying in less populous states / less desirable locations is also strongly advised.\n\nGet your resume looked at ASAP and start applying, you\u2019ll be fine.",

Don\u2019t put it on your resume and don\u2019t tell anyone unless they ask. If they do ask in the application write a cover letter to add to the good things you\u2019ve done. If they ask in the interview give a brief \u201cI had some personal/family commitments outside of school that kept me from studying as much as I liked\u201d. If they act like that\u2019s not good enough or try to pry get out. You don\u2019t want to work for them.",

I didn't put mine on my resume (it was like 2.7) and I never got asked (entry-level construction testing jobs for geotech firms). I think GPA matters for super competitive and high paying jobs that get tons of applicants. But if it's a company that is struggling to fill positions, like many companies right now with such low unemployment, they probably only care that (a) you simply did graduate, (b) you have some relevant skills, and (c) your interview shows you're a normal person who can work with other humans and you can learn stuff.",

    "postText": "Hey yall, with my HS graduation coming in the next few weeks I have been thinking about my college experience a lot. I'm signed up to be roommates with 2 of my best friends and looked at the Chemical Engineering track online. If Mines honors my test scores I should be able to skip fall chem and maybe spring. Is this a good idea? Is there any advice you could give for my degree or campus life/ study habits? Maybe dorm life hacks? Thanks!",

            "comment": "Definitely skip Chem 1 and 2 if you are given the choice, it'll lesses your workload in the coming semesters. As an incoming junior in chemE, you NEED to keep track of what classes you need to take in the fall or spring at any given time because the chemE department will only offer classes once a year. I basically have a 4-year plan just in case it all goes south. Another thing I would recommend is build a solid study habit: if you want to do well and get enough sleep, do your school work during any free time you get. You need to adapt to all environments because you won't have the opportunity to go to your favorite study spot with the time you are given, so you'll have to make do with what you have in the now. Also, make friends in all your classes. They're the reason I'm passing my classes, especially ochem.\n\nLastly, take breaks. ChemE is workload heavy. There will come times where you have to sacrifice one class over another, so pay attention to your syllabuses and to how much/what you can drop. Take advantage of that to determine what class you need to prioritize.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have any other questions! I'm going into the process engineering track and getting a minor in energy. :)",

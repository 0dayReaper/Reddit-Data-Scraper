Some people were sad and lonely and never did anything with anyone except study. We made burgers on a george foreman grill in our room and had people over for burger night lol. We had star trek watch parties in our rooms. We did roller chair jousting in the hallway. We got busted for drinking. We also studied a lot. It is what you make of it.",

I made a few good friends and don't have any gripes besides the fact that there are no water fountains super close by. Get a fan for the warmer months though",

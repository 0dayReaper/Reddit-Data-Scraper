Lots of old, bawdy songs. It was led by the head RA, IIRC, and horribly not politically correct. (The term politically correct wouldn\u2019t be coined for years.) A good time was had by all.\n\nThe next year\u2019s songfest occurred, but the bawdy songs were gone. The year after that, there was no songfest. \n\nI suspect that the dorm RAs were ordered to confiscate the mimeographed lyrics. Mine disappeared somewhere during my first semester. No one else could find theirs, either.\n\nSome of those songs deserve to be forgotten. Others were just good, clean dirty fun. I can remember only a few song titles. *sigh*",

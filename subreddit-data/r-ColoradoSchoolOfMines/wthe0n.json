They don't check who the vehicle owner is so I figured it might work. Not sure if there's some weird thing with only one vehicle can be parked on campus at a time or something like that",

I would imagine what you're suggesting is not ideal, but if you don't park at the same time you may be fine. If there is even a few minutes of overlap it's probable they will figure it out and you'll get a ticket. I'd recommend reading the policy or calling and asking, just to be sure.",

I know my roommates do this with two cars and share but as others have said you can only have one car on campus at a time. Not sure how that would be checked and if you\u2019ll get flagged say you arrive after your buddy leaves campus but can be helpful if you can carpool.",

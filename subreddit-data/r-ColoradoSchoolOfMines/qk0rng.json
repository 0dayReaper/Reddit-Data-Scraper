    "postText": "I\u2019m trying to decide between applying to Colorado School or Mines and University of Denver, so I\u2019m trying to learn more about each school directly from students.\nI\u2019m applying as either an Electrical Engineering major or Computer Engineering major, but my interests also extend to Bioinformatics, Biochemical Engineering, Data Science, Machine learning and signal processing for medical applications, and Virtual reality development.\n\nI really like the vibe I\u2019ve gotten from Colorado School of Mines, and I like that it\u2019s more tech focused. However, I was born and raised in cities, and I worry that Mines is a bit to rural. I love the idea of being able to hike in the mountains, but I don\u2019t love the idea of needing to drive everywhere off campus.\n\nWhat have your experiences been like at Mines? Do you feel like the school has helped you get internships in the areas you\u2019re interested in? Is it okay for kids who aren\u2019t really looking for a party school? Is it at all bikeable? Is it easy to get the classes you want and participate in hands on learning opportunities?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit: Also wanted to ask: How are disability support services? I have level one autism(very low support needs), so that\u2019s just something I want to be aware of when choosing a college.",

Mines isn\u2019t cheap either though, even thought they\u2019re public. Consider CU Boulder instead imo, but idk how \u201ccity like\u201d Boulder feel tbh.",

            "comment": "For anything science related, go to Mines. DU is predominantly business and law. It's overrpriced, as well. DU isn't also that \"urban\". While it definitely is closer to downtown Denver, you still have to drive to most things. Golden itself is pretty small, but Mines is actually close to the important parts: restaurants, Coors, grocery stores.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI personally felt that Mines was really painful. Sure, I now have a superiority complex and judge every non engineering STEM major at my new grad school, but Mines still left deep wounds in my psyche. In my experience, the students are amazing. There's no rivalry and no animosity. We're all in this together. The faculty are a bit sadistic tho. Mines has very good disability support (because the curriculum often exacerbates underlying mental issues).\n\nDU is great for an MBA or law school. Everything else is pretty much a joke. Their athletics is amazing, so if you're a good athlete, there's that. In Colorado, going to DU for undergrad usually means you have rich parents and don't study that intensively.\n\nI'd also that Boulder is potentially a good medium for this (someone else in the comments mentioned it). Boulder is urban (I think it's cringe, but it's a solid city with fun things), and CU Boulder is often viewed as a party school, but perhaps a competent one. CU has a solid engineering program (which rivals Mines in some things, but lacks the edge field session imparts) and is moderately well respected. Still a party school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut most importantly, the Light Rail exists. DU is possibly the most convenient location on the light rail, as only the W line services Golden and you need to take a shuttle from JeffCo to the actual Mines campus (The DU station is across the street from the Ritchie Center). I think Boulder has a Light Rail line as well, but it's only one line.",

You guys are the most supportive group of engineering students I\u2019ve ever encountered, which is awesome! I live out of state, but I\u2019m planning to take an in person tour soon. I really like the campus based off of the virtual tour, and I remember loving the Denver area last time I visited. I\u2019ve decided to apply to Mines, so thank you to you and everyone who commented on this post!",

            "comment": "Mines without question as said above. From the people I know at DU, their STEM programs are underfunded, as it is a liberal arts college. I think you'll find that Golden feels fairly urban, just because it's surrounded by mountains. It does not feel rural near the campus. We also have close proximity to downtown Denver (20 min drive).\n\nGolden is very bikeable, although it's also very hilly. There are good connections, especially to the light rail and there's a grocery store a block from campus. I know many people who get by at Mines perfectly fine without a car, there is a lot to do in downtown Golden even thou it's small.\n\nMines has very good hands on curriculum and once you are in your major classes, you can get to know the faculty.\n\nAs for disability support, I personally have not interacted with them but I have never heard anything bad, and support is taken very seriously by faculty to make sure you can succeed.\n\nMines is very much not a party school. They do happen, but they're nothing compared to Boulder.",

            "comment": "&gt; I worry that Mines is a bit to rural. I love the idea of being able to hike in the mountains, but I don\u2019t love the idea of needing to drive everywhere off campus.\n\nMines is not rural--Golden is definitely part of the Denver metro area.  You're an hour, by bus, from downtown Denver, and for most stuff (groceries, restaurants, outdoor gear, etc) downtown Golden (~10 minute walk, if that) is adequate.\n\n&gt; Do you feel like the school has helped you get internships in the areas you\u2019re interested in?\n\nYes, and more than usual.  Most people I know who did their undergrad elsewhere got significantly less career support.\n\n&gt; Is it okay for kids who aren\u2019t really looking for a party school?\n\nUnequivocally.  Most Mines students aren't partiers.\n\n&gt; Is it at all bikeable?\n\nLots of cyclists on campus. Golden is a huge cyclist town.\n\n&gt; Is it easy to get the classes you want\n\nReasonably.  Some of the top-choice humanities courses fill up very quickly, but I don't think I missed out on any technical courses for lack of space.\n\n&gt; and participate in hands on learning opportunities?\n\nYou can't avoid it.  Design I and II and Senior Design will all require hands-on work (edit: and field session, don't know how I forgot that).",

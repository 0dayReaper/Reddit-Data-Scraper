    "postText": "Welp I've had probably the shittiest week of my life and it's all thanks to this school :) I got emailed two days ago about possible academic misconduct on my notes submissions which seems pretty wack to begin with. In phys 2 we have to submit out pre class notes and our in class notes, what I've been doing all semester is just submitting my pre class notes twice, while still doing normal lecture notes, so I don't have to worry about assignments. Apparently that's academic misconduct and despite the fact that I showed the course coordinator my notes and everything she didn't care. This will be my second academic misconduct and as the final is tomorrow I'd like to know a couple things. I'm losing my scholarship and will be a semester behind if this appeal doesn't go in my favor. So I'd pretty much lose everything is it even realistic for me to hope on my appeal? I was told today that the appeal would be in January so I'm really not sure what to do.",

It was my second offense, my first being for clicking in for a student in phys 2 lecture who wasn\u2019t in class that day. I\u2019m an alumni now too fwiw. If you want a real conversation/answer, dm me. I\u2019m happy to provide some advice",

That's a lot to keep track of, it's the lowest stakes assignment possible and it's legit a thing to worry about forgetting to turn it in when you also have 20 other submissions in other classes to worry about that week. I think that submitting in class notes is a bit silly anyway because previous semesters never had the requirement, we only had clicker questions.\n\nLike technically it is academic misconduct so there's not much you can do but ask for forgiveness and explain why you did what you thought you needed to.",

I don't know the full extent of your situation, these are just my thoughts, heed them at your own risk.\n\nSo unfortunately, you're pretty boned here. It looks like the case against you is:\n\n\"\u2022 Dishonest Conduct - general conduct unbecoming a scholar. Examples include issuing misleading statements; withholding pertinent information; submitting previously graded work as new and/or original without acknowledgement and permission; not fulfilling, in a timely fashion, previously agreed to projects or activities; and verifying as true, things that are known to the student not to be true or verifiable.\"\n\nSaying \"I didn't know\" isn't a viable defense because:\n\n\"Academic misconduct may also occur when a student is negligent in their reasonable responsibilities as a student to be aware of or proactively confirm or clarify appropriate conduct with coursework, assignments or exams, and subsequently proceeds in a manner befitting of misconduct\"\n\nOn the bright side, according to what you said it looks like you'd be getting the minimum punishment out of the following:\n\n\"If a student is found to have engaged in such misconduct sanctions such as change of a grade, loss of institutional privileges, or academic suspension or dismissal may be imposed.\"\n\nIt looks like the only way you can get out of this scott-free is if you can prove you weren't granted due process. From what I can gather, it is unlikely your current appeal will be approved (again, this depends on what you wrote and how things actually happened which I do not know)\n\nIn either case, I would start documenting everything I can related to this case if I were you.\n\nIf your appeal is dismissed, and you find a discrepancy in due process, submit an appeal review as outlined below:\n\n\"In such cases [where the appeal is denied], the original decision of the faculty member is considered binding upon all involved and the matter will be considered closed unless the student can provide evidence that the Dean of Students made an arbitrary decision without fully considering the information presented. If that is the case, the student requesting the appeal must notify the Associate Vice President of Student Life in writing within two business days and request that the appeal be reviewed again by the Associate Vice President of Student Life.\"\n\nIt would be a desperate attempt, but if you find any evidence it's better than nothing at that point.\n\nIf the appeal is granted, then it's still not over. You'll have to go to an appeal meeting (which is kinda like a court) and there you will plead your case. I can't really advise here without further knowledge, but yeah that's basically my 2 cents.",

While I personally don't think what you've described is a big issue, they apparently don't believe so. Expect nothing less from this school, it's a way to make you do useless things and then squeeze more money out of you.\n\nWhat I would recommend is preparing as much as you can for this appeal. Organize all of your in lecture notes, so that you can show you still did the work. Go through the syllabus and see if there is anything against it. At the very least, you should be able to argue that it was all your work.\n\nAlso, this should be a minor thing that would warrant an email asking you not to do it anymore. Before pinging you for misconduct.\n\nOf course it all looks worse, since you apparently have another strike.\n\nHonestly, at least from your version about this incidence, they shouldn't expel you. After all they love money more than life here anyway. So what's a little misconduct?",

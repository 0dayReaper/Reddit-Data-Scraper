He seems to think there won\u2019t be much competition but I don\u2019t know what gives him that impression (based on what I know of mines).",

I'll be doing a grad program starting next spring, and one of the professors who I asked to write me a letter of rec told me that they would vouch for me to the other members if needed. So your professor might have a lot of influence in admission outcomes since they're on the review board.",

Research consortiums in the department are small tight teams that are often run with \"soft\" money so they have to ensure that you're a team player and willing to put the time in to ensure results &amp; future funding.",

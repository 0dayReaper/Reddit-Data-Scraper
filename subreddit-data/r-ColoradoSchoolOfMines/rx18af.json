But also, something to add - CS industry is very easy to get into. It\u2019s more experience based then anything.\n\nTake me for example, my undergrad was at Mines for geology, I\u2019m now at Cal Poly Pomona for my MS in industrial engineering and I get recruited for data science roles continuously because I have done a lot of basic work with AWS databases, statistical modeling, and just being very adjacent to the Dev Ops &amp; back-end software teams - no CS courses ever taken.",

I can say that the CS program (CS@Mines) has grown tremendously and is on par with other majors. As mentioned, the professors are great and the department offers many opportunities to network, on top of providing a rigorous computer science curriculum rich in theory, application, and research.",

During my time, you got out what you put in \u2014 including any side projects you might have been doing along with coursework. Nowadays, the opportunities don't require so much exploration outside of class, though that style of exploration will enrich everything you do in the classroom.\n\nAfter graduation, I got hired at Pivotal Software (later acquired by VMware), and I'm now at CircleCI. Not FAANG companies, but I love what I do. I thrive in the mid-size multi-billion valued company because I can have a wider impact across the organization.",

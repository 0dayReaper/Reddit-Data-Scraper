    "postText": "[Download here!](https://diggingdeeperatmines.wordpress.com/)\n\nI've spent over a year creating this project. It includes extensive research and student survey responses giving their tips for success.  It is designed as a guide for anyone looking to improve their wellness at Mines. While I'd like you to read it in full, I know you all are busy. The table of contents has clickable links so you can skip to the section(s) you have interest in.\n\nI highly recommend new/prospective students give this a look because it condenses most of the school information into one place. For current students and alumni, the mental health section may be of interest of you. There are dozens of student perspectives on the subject. Have a look and please enjoy!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have started a go-fund-me to get printed copies made. They will be free and available on Mines Campus if if can get the funding. \n\n https://gofund.me/cb990343 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan a mod please pin this post?

Not eligible for the [gold mine](https://www.givecampus.com/schools/ColoradoSchoolofMines) either because I was independent. Gofundme is in the main post if you'd like to see physical copies around campus!",

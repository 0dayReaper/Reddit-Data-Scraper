Curving aside, it diminishes the reputation of the university if it becomes widespread; the whole reason employers like Mines (as far as I know) is because of a tough program.  That counts for nothing if a large portion of students are cheating.\n\nOf course, we could just do projects and do away with the whole issue, but for how many classes is that practical?",

The education system has not kept up with technology as teaching/exams follow the same process as they did in the pre-internet days. It seems hard to justify an exam based on someones ability to memorize a formula rather than today's working world which is more focused on collaboration/communication than memorization.   I have hired interns/employees from CU, CSM and Metro and I make the assumption they are all smart since they made it to the college level.  I want interns/employees that can continue to learn. Mines is a great school and you will do well!",

Some employers seem to give (unduly?) elevated status to Mines--the place I interned at this summer exclusively recruits here.\n\nI will say that I don't think I've had a single memorization-based exam at Mines, though. In any formula-heavy class there's been a formula sheet or we've had to bring our own note sheet.",

The assumption on an exam without \"this problem cannot be solved\" as an option is that all problems are solvable. I guarantee I would waste time trying to find a solution on my own and my score on other problems would likely suffer.  \n\n\nA much better option would be to put a subtle error in the chegg solution that still isn't an easy mistake to make. Like a completely wrong math error in an intermediate step.",

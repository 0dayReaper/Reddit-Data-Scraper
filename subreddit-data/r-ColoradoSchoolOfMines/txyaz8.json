            "comment": "Took it over the summer, it was pretty good. If you don\u2019t have much music background it might be tough because the professor mostly assumes you already know that stuff (There is some review at the start but not a lot). Analyzing songs took some time but it wasn\u2019t anything too difficult. If you\u2019re into jazz that\u2019s what the class seemed mostly centered on, by the end you\u2019ll be listening to a wide variety of music though. \n\nAs far as pacing, it\u2019s been a year so it\u2019s hard to recall, but I think Cullison tries to keep a fast pace for the most part. It is a 3 hour long course, which was tiring after an 8-5 shift, but if I remember correctly it was once a week. \n\nOverall, chill class, it was fun to just listen to music and see how it has evolved for the past few hundred years. Very manageable as someone who was doing 40 hour work weeks",

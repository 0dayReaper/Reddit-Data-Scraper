    "postText": "Hey all, I saw [this](https://twitter.com/nanaoseiopare/status/1449763151566753792) twitter thread detailing an incident at Mines where Coach Brandon and a handful of football players got confrontational over a classroom scheduling conflict. No one I know has heard of this incident, and I was wondering if any of you experienced it and/or know someone who did.",

            "comment": "As of this point, we have yet to hear any word supporting this claim from anyone outside of the professor's family, here or on Twitter. Given that this was reportedly a class of 100, that leaves these claims looking highly suspicious.\n\nAdditional issues:\n\n- Does Mines even have 100 person classes? Maybe some of the freshmen level gen-ed requirements. \n\n- It seems unlikely that an incident could be witnessed by nearly 10% of the freshmen class and none of them would have talked about it publicly. \n\n- How did none of the 100 students present record anything on a phone when they started getting threatened? \n\n - It has been two full weeks since this incident apparently occurred, and five days since the tweets were posted. Nobody else has come forward to say they witnessed this.\n\n***If anyone has evidence of any sort that this actually happened, I will update this***\n\n*Update: it appears the school did receive a report of something happening. They refused to comment when asked by press, but did state that no student athletes were involved.  So either the school is lying to the press, or the professor's family is embellishing the facts. I have no idea which.*",

            "comment": "Yea, this was a soil mechanics class that many of my colleges took part in. They have class in Marv Kay. The football coach came in during class and ordered ALL students and the professor to leave. He ordered his football players to physically and verbally remove all students from the classroom. They got their way, and kicked everyone out.\n\nAll I know for the outcome is their soil mech class was moved to Hill Hall now. The football coach \u201capologized\u201d, but he also threatened that he would get his way, and he did. I know this angered many students, and obviously the professor. Who knew that being a football coach with players under your command meant you could kick out an entire Junior Level Soil Mechanics class and harass Mines Students? \n\nSuch a sad look for Mines Athletics.\n\nIf anyone has questions feel free to ask, I know multiple students who were in the class when it occurred.",

I don't see it being real at this time, although could see it happening at least on the schools side, based on the seeming non-reaction. \n\nIf there's any solid details, we could actually try and figure out what happened.",

It\u2019s doable, you just have to make sacrifices, and most of the time that was my social life and involvement in clubs/activities that got cut. \n\nIf I could go back I would absolutely dial back the amount of time I spent working. You are paying a significant amount of money to go to school, and that includes the social aspect of it as well, so get your moneys worth. There is plenty of time to be working after you graduate.",

It can count towards tech electives, or you could apply for MURF so you can get paid a little bit through the semester. During the summer professors themselves will often pay for undergrad researchers. Just go to faculty page for your major (or whatever department you seek opportunities) and click around on professors to see what research they\u2019re doing and then reach out to them. Guarantee you\u2019ll get a position, professors are required to serve students, it\u2019s part of their tenure. Good luck!",

If it feels doable after a month or two (or whatever feels natural), you can adjust your job/schedule to have a good balance without too much stress. So it's definitely possible, depending on your work ethic, scheduling skills, and stress management.\n\nAlso, an important note: don't back yourself into a major commitment to your job, where you can't easily quit if you need to. My old job relied too much on me and made it difficult to leave. That was partially my fault. \n\nWork hard, but make it clear that the job isn't a priority in your life. Not unless you want it to be your career.",

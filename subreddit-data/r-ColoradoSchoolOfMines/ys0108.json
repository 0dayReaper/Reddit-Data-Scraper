It punishes people who need help and TA hours are always overloaded and under staffed so good luck getting help. Sometimes they don\u2019t even show up. It\u2019s bullshit that this class is required even if it\u2019s not a pre-req.",

Like to the tee, exactly what they teach in the class. I will say the spatial reasoning tests they have you do are completely useless, and I think the instruction leans a little too hands-off. But nah, otherwise I think it's a dope class, especially for mechanicals.",

There was this like 7 foot athlete that sat in front of me and would constantly lean back and physically bump me often. I couldn\u2019t move because the classroom was so small so idk, I dreaded going after the first couple weeks. Ended up taking the class at RRCC instead. It\u2019s not any better, busy work wise, but the class only had 10 students. That alone made it infinitely more bearable. Also no labs, everyone is done in class which was nice.",

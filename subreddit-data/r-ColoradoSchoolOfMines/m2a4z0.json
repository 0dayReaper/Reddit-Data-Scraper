MARCH RIGHT UP TO PCJ AND TELL THAT MAN THAT HE'S PAYING FOR YOUR TICKET CAUSE YOUR PAYING FOR HIS $12,000 A YEAR STARBUCKS HABIT WHILE YOU SIT IN YOUR APARTMENT AND WEEP OVER YOUR ONLINE CLASSES.\n\nYOU GOTTA GET MAD!  YOUR CAR MADE THAT LOT BETTER, YOU TELL THEM I SAID THAT CAUSE WHEN I SEE AN ILLEGAL PARKED CAR IT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER, AS IF WHAT I'M DOING AT MINES IS RIGHT.  DON'T PAY, MAKE THEM PAY!",

            "comment": "You can try calling the office and speaking with someone before filing an appeal. Appeals go to neutral referees who aren't affiliated with the parking office and their decisions are final -- pretty strict on the policy.\n\nSounds like an interesting problem you could talk to someone about. I can't guarantee they will wave it. Mines Park residents can only have their Mines Park permit, which is outlined in the policy. EDIT: so from what you wrote in another post that is where I think the problem might lie, but I can't be \ud83d\udcaf\n\nYou also have to realize enforcement officers only know what they see -- so when a vehicle is flagged and reads \"misuse of permit\" that's what they go with. They don't know how long you've gotten away with it or how long you were parked.. etc etc. The office has also been short handed this year so it's possible you could have \"gotten away with it\" this long.\n\nSource: I work in the parking office. I'm happy to answer questions but you can call us tomorrow. \u263a\ufe0f",

            "comment": "So with a misuse ticket, the ticket applies to both vehicles, meaning you have to pay both. I've had success in appealing and only paying for one ticket if you make up a good excuse or compassion that they are double charging you. Technically you aren't supposed to have two people using the same pass but it's pretty (very) stupid if you're only on campus for a few hours a week",

I only come to campus once a week, so he uses it when I am not there. They gave him a ticket at the commuter lot because he was on two passes and we both got fines. We haven't had this issue for the past 6 months, so I am pretty confused because I thought this was ok.",

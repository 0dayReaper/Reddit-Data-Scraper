    "postText": "I got accepted into the Thorsons honors program and I need to decide if I actually want to do it. I looked at some of the other posts about the Thorsons honors program and it seems like the consensus is that both freshman year course options (Thorsons or Design/HASS) kinda suck, is this true? And if so, which path is the lesser of two evils? (For context I like visual art, and reading fiction, I don't mind reading articles, I am not a fan of writing poetry/artistic writing, and I will be studying ME.) Thank you so much for any/all advice and insight.",

            "comment": "Current Thorsonite here.\n\nIt is very fun but it is a lot of work. On the bright side, from what I hear the work we do has more purpose and is far more meaningful than that done for NHV and Design.\n\nThroughout the year, you keep a sketchbook for drawing and notetaking called an IDEA Journal (IJ for short). You have assigned entries and weekly reflections in your IJ. Some assignments are good and others miss but there will be a solid half you will enjoy and another quarter which will be a breeze.\n\nIn the first semester, you explore your creativity through a series of assignments involving a fairly equal mix of both art and (keyword) creative writing (don't worry though I mean the fun kind not the poetic English nerd stuff) including an autobiography of place and an op-ed. You end with an introduction to the design process in a short design project focused on process.\n\nThe second semester starts with a 10 week long design project, but this time it's for real. Both process and project deliverables matter in your final grade for this. Concurrently you also have to learn CAD software. In the past it has always been SketchUp but starting this year you can now choose between that, SolidWorks or AutoCAD. \n\nThe rest of the second semester involves exploring a broad topic with a professor and also working on a portfolio to exhibit your journey in the class. These topics can range from things like satire to thermodynamics, but you get to list your top picks and chances are you'll get first pick.\n\nA recurring theme of Thorson's extracurriculars is the House Cup, where you are sorted into a \"house\" (like Harry Potter, minus the transphobe POS author) and compete for points. The houses with the highest points as well as the highest contributing students can get prizes throughout the year.\n\nSome extra features of the class are events and trips for Thorsonites that you can sign up for. Additionally, if you plan on going to Antibes, France for your first semester there will be a special version of Thorson catered to you that semester.\n\nIs it easy? No, but again, the work is a lot more fun and meaningful. The community of Thorsonites is very diverse and one that encourages discussion on a variety of topics.\n\nI would highly recommend applying and accepting your spot here if you are admitted into it. If you have any more questions feel free to ask!",

            "comment": "NHV and design are both somewhat difficult and it really depends on the professor. In NHV I averaged around 4 hours of out of class work per week, including papers, reading, lectures, etc. but I have friends who professors assigned work that took them closer to 8 or 10. On the contrary I have a really strict design professor. Tbh I don\u2019t really find design hard at all still. We have a 70 page document that 5 people have been working on all semester and I just have to sit down once a month for 2-3 hours to get that complete. Besides that practically no work.\n\nBoth classes you get what you give. It\u2019s easy to get through the work and just get good grades or pass the class, but they are classes that have a lot of skills and lessons that can be applied to other parts of life",

            "comment": "Thorson is a double edged sword. You get out of NHV and Design 1, which is nice, and you also get to be a part of a community of people who are similar to you. On the flip side there have been several times this year where I have been frustrated or angry with the class. \n\nMost significantly, the design project at the start of the second semester is less about design and more about ethics/process work. This didn\u2019t mesh well with me, and I spent a lot of the time feeling frustrated. But then you get through that and do module 5, where you pair up with a professor in smaller groups and learn about their passion, which so far has been great.\n\nAll in all, I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth it. If you do decide to join Thorson, absolutely sign up for the Honors TLC. It\u2019s a floor of all Thorson kids and really easy to find a community. I also know the RAs for it next year and they\u2019re great people.",

NHV and design teach you solidworks and other stuff important to that major and if you take Thorson, you'll be behind by a lot going into your sophomore year because they don't teach solidworks in the program. That being said, if you're not a mech-e, I recommend it. It really is easier and a lot less work than design and NHV and you won't be behind at all for sophomore year.",

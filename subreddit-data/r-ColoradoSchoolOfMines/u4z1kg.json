Earth sciences (geology, geophysics, mining, petroleum, and maybe enviro) folks will definitely know and be impressed worldwide. \n\nOutside of that if they're from the region they'll know and be impressed. Outside of the rocky mountain area no one will have a damn clue unless they looked at it themselves or know someone who went there. It's a great school but the programs for the most part aren't anything special on a national level and frankly the barrier for entry is quite low compared to top top schools.",

But ime, the brand name is strongest in the rocky mountain region; pretty well-known in the midwest; not-unheard-of on the west coast, and basically unknown out east. I've gotten internship offers/interviews from every region of the contiguous US, but mostly from the rockies and west coast, and only a single interview from the northeast. \n\nMaybe someone else could chime in with their experiences, but I've gotten the impression that on the west coast, it seems like WA is disproportionately familiar with Mines. I know there are a couple reliable employers of Mines alumni up there, and I've had almost as many internship interviews from WA companies as CA ones. Not sure if it's really a thing, but that's the impression I get.",

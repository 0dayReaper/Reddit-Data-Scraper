    "postText": "Hi. I'm about to graduate with my BS in Computer Science and BS in Mathematics and am looking at PhD programs for CS in the Western US. I'm originally from the Southeast, so I've no real knowledge of the area.\n\nAnyway, Mines has caught my eye and I'd love any more information y'all could share about the place! Here are some questions I have, but I'd appreciate anything else you think is useful:\n\n1. What's campus life like? Are there a lot of clubs and organizations (besides Greek Life)? What kind of events does the college try and organize?\n2. Does the university feel more like a big city, small town, or a something in the middle?\n3. What's the climate/weather like? Where I'm from it's normal to get into the low triple digits in July/August, and in February it usually gets into the teens for a week or two, but on average I'd say the spring, summer, and fall are hot &amp; humid, and the winter is mild/cool.\n4. What's the outdoor scene like? I live in the Appalachian mountains right now, so hiking is one of my favorite past times. How common is backpacking, rock climbing, kayaking, camping, etc?\n5. How does living on campus compare with living off campus?\n6. What can you say about the Computer Science program? Professors, class sizes, difficulty, research areas- anything is helpful!\n\nI appreciate any insight you can offer.",

            "comment": "Two: It's def a small, tourist town. Has way more bars/beer gardens/etc. then a town normally of it's size. This is a good and a bad thing. \n\nThree: It can hit \\~100, but it cools off at night in the summer, but no humidity when it does. Way more comfortable than the south east. In the winter, not weird for it to be 18 out with 6\" of snow on the ground. Unlike the midwest, the snow does melt though. Don't expect 5 foot snow drifts all winter.\n\nFour: All of those things you can do within 15 minutes to 2 hours of school. Some great climbing walking distance from campus. \n\nFive: I would never live on campus personally. The grad housing is expensive, IMO. \n\nSix: It's a busy, very full department. The highest growth department at mines. Expect ordered chaos. But it's also a good department.",

            "comment": "1. There are a good number of clubs; there's a club fair in the first few weeks of the year.  You see a good number of sports-type clubs, a lot of professional associations and similar, plus a good selection of random things (philosophy club, fencing, whatever).  Graduate Student Government also organizes various social events and the like.\n2. The local area feels like a smaller town (the touristy kind), but there's easy access to the Denver metro area.\n3. Summer highs hit the 90s and might occasionally break 100.  There are frequent thunderstorms for parts of the summer, and we get substantial snow sometimes.  Winter lows do occasionally drop to the single digits.  It's very windy in the winter.\n4. Fantastic.  Mines is a wonderful place for an outdoorsy type.\n   * There are a few solid hiking trails you can get to on foot from campus, and I don't mean \"a flattish stroll around the park\"; Chimney Gulch Trail, the closest, has several hundred feet of elevation gain and leads into Beaver Brook Trail, which goes on for something like 10 miles and traverses rock fields and the like.\n   * There's climbing a few miles away at North Table Mountain.  Beyond that I don't know about serious climbing, but you can get to lots of class-3 fourteener routes nearby (14ers.com lists six class-3 routes in the Front Range).\n   * You're within an hour and a half of tons of Front Range hikes.  That's mostly National Forest, so it's great for backpacking too.  I go hiking in the Rockies most summer weekends and throw in a few backpacking trips as well.  Two hours will get you to Mount Elbert, which is the second-highest peak in the continental US (a 10-mile hike with 4500 feet of elevation gain).\n   * There are kayakers (and lots of tubers) on Clear Creek in the summer.\n5. The graduate student housing is a bit pricey, but it's convenient.  Can't comment on off campus housing.",

            "comment": "1. There are tons of different clubs, from the gaming club to robotics to guns and more! The school offers few events, such as homecoming and (more recently) Oktoberfest.\n2. Golden is very much small-town, though as other people have stated it's close to Denver\n3. I cannot say much about the summer, but I know for certain the winter gets really cold and the roads get icy and dangerous if you're not careful.\n4. There are many hiking trails around Golden, as we're located right next to the rocky mountains. It's a pretty great town for people who like outdoors-y places\n5. There are pros and cons to either situation; for example, living on campus requires you to purchase a meal plan, even if you plan to buy your own food. However, looking for housing elsewhere can be tough and expensive if you don't start early enough.\n6. I'd say that even though CS@Mines is the newest department of Mines, it's one of, if not the most organized departments; the classes can be challenging, but not over-the-top difficult-for-no-reason, like Physics. I'd wager the average classroom will have about 40-60 students, so expect a lot of classmates. (I could be wrong about those numbers though)",

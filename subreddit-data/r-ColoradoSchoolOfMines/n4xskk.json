I\u2019m an undergrad and have no idea if we are doing a graduation ceremony practice or just winging it. How has the ceremony gone for alumni? The school has not told us much info considering that its in a week and a half.",

We all met in the field house, you checked in and they handed you a card, the card put you into a marching order and you had it scanned before you walked on stage. No practicing, it was all day of. \n\nI hope they send something soon because I need to know when/where to be from a carpooling standpoint with my family!",

If not I would send an email to commencement@mines.edu, and they can add you. If you weren\u2019t automatically added though I would double check that your request to graduate has been confirmed because it should have put you on the canvas page automatically if it was.",

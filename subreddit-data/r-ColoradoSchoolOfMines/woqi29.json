All of the software I\u2019ve needed were compatible and all the profs were familiar with the Mac version. There are also lots of windows/Linux computer labs if you end up needing them. No sense shelling out money for a new computer.",

As long as you are familiar with how Windows and Mac are different you should be okay. And for the first 2 years, most of what you\u2019ll need is internet access to various books/homework sites. Oh and chegg. Never forget chegg.",

    "postText": "It makes no sense why mines requires to take 2 random Science classes with no relation to your major. It heavily limits those who want to do a minor in something requiring to take a class that has no relevance to there interests. \n\nWhy can\u2019t I take some more advanced science classes instead? Or just have them be free electives.",

            "comment": "Engineering students have this idea that they need to focus on their *one thing* in order to be successful. This does not translate well to real life. There is immeasurable value to being well-rounded in addition to having your specialty. Taking an upper-level course in your major is not a substitute for having basic knowledge in a field adjacent to your major.\n\nI studied Physics. My job is in the world of optical communication, shooting lasers down optical fiber. I don't use Biology in the day-to-day. BUT when we had a customer come to us wanting to use our equipment for a system that uses lasers for health monitoring, it was a massive benefit for me to know enough basic biology to follow along with their goals. If I *only* knew my wave equations and E&amp;M, I could only have a very surface-level discussion with them and not understand well enough to probe into the future potential (for my company) of their device.\n\nAlso, recognizing that CSCI101 is kind of a dumpster fire of a curriculum, having basic programming knowledge is indispensable these days. I'm not a software developer, but I need to know enough about programming to translate between my R&amp;D team and end users, in both directions. *That* is outside my major and absolutely part of my day-to-day.",

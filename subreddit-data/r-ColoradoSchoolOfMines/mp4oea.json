    "postText": "So I'm registered for the civil field session this summer and I'm wondering what it's like, what we do, what the workload is, etc. I've heard very little about it so I'm just trying to get an idea of what I'm getting myself into. If anyone has any information, I will gladly accept it.",

            "comment": "It's great, one of my favorite classes.  The general subject is surveying.\n\nMost days, you'll start (at 7 or 7:30 am) with a lecture, which could be anywhere from half an hour to most of the morning.  That'll cover theory, how to use the equipment, what you'll be doing in the field, etc.  You'll learn stuff like aliquot parts (how we divide land for surveying purposes), unit systems, a bit of spherical trigonometry, that sort of thing.\n\nThe rest of the day will be in the field doing a lab.  You stick with the same survey crew (3 people) for the whole class.  Labs aren't scored 0-100; you either get it right (within tolerance) or you do it again.  Almost everyone repeats a few labs, sometimes multiple times.  (The big hill towards the back of the survey field is called Repeat Hill for good reason.)\n\nThe lab will generally require you to measure something, or, later on, stake something out.  You'll start with basics like pacing out distances, then move on to steel tape (similar to a tape measure) and hand levels, then engineer's levels, and then more sophisticated modern equipment; the hard part is that you need to measure distances and elevations very precisely, often over uneven terrain.  You do learn how to do \"real\" surveying at a basic level.  I interned on a survey crew (just basic stuff, though) and already knew how to do everything we did.  (Survey field session was instrumental in getting the internship, actually.)\n\nLab can run as late as 6:30 before you have to leave, but that's fairly uncommon.  Unless you hit that time limit (and have to finish later), you'll stay until you're done with the lab for the day.  Some days we were done at noon, and some days we got pretty close to the cutoff.  Saturdays are used for quizzes/exams (classroom and field).\n\nIt's a lot of fun and very useful.  Do dress for sun protection or bring sunscreen and use it regularly; some people got really badly torched in the first few days, since you will often be out for most of the hottest part of the day.  Personally, I decided to pick up a few long-sleeved workwear shirts from Goodwill after the first day, and a wide-brimmed hat is helpful.  A bandana is useful to protect the back of your neck.  Also, bring a water bottle (there's a water fountain at the parking lot, but you won't want to trek all the way over there every time you get thirsty).  You're required to have long pants and over-the-ankle shoes to protect against rattlesnakes, and you'll want the shoes (and all your clothes) to be comfortable for a lot of walking around on uneven ground in hot weather.\n\nThat's everything I can think of off the top of my head, but I'm happy to answer any additional questions.",

I may be looking in the wrong places, but I haven\u2019t been able to find much information regarding either program and whether people think it\u2019s worth doing or not. Do you guys have any input?",

            "comment": "I took the Thorson honors program a year ago, it started out okay but rapidly snowballed into chaos. There are 6 professors teaching the class and they don\u2019t communicate so your grade is entirely based on your ability to guess what they want. You\u2019ll spend hours and hours outside of class working on unless design concepts that are graded on \u201cyour process\u201d instead of the final product. For a certain type of student, this class is good at introducing new ways to think of design processes. But for most of my peers we found that it was kind of a joke class (almost impossible to get an A btw). Also last thing, you can\u2019t get the solid works certification in thorson so don\u2019t take it if you\u2019re a MechE unless you can teach yourself.",

I think I would have liked to take NHV more than this, but I have definitely liked Grandey more than regular design 1. If you're able to manage the projects and complete the work it's not too bad. It's hard to say really if it's more or less work than the regular freshman classes. If it seems interesting I would say go for it, but Grandey hasn't really been amazing or terrible enough to give a strong recommendation either way.",

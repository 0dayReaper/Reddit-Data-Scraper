                                    "comment": "I really enjoyed my time there and I'm usually in favor of recommending Mines, though everyone is different. The physics professors I've had have largely been great and I know the school provides many research opportunities. It is one of the smaller departments. For reference, my undergrad graduating class had roughly 60 students from Physics, while the largest, Mechanical Engineering, and about 400+ (out of a total 900-1000  graduates that year).\n\nI quickly skimmed through the faculty and the only one I recognized was Dr. Carr, who I figured would be on there. Before the program existed, if I'm remembering correctly, he had offered a quantum-based research opportunity to 3 students in my class. My aforementioned friend applied, but wasn't selected, so I didn't hear anything about that afterward.\n\nSo even if the QE program is new, they have been teaching quantum mechanics classes for a while and have staff well-versed in it (or so I would hope if they're starting a whole Master's program around it).\n\nAnother thing to note it that, when it comes to science research, Mines usually gets knocked off the list by Ivy League or other larger state schools. But when it comes to engineering specifically, Mines consistently ranks toward or at the top in the U.S. So I could extrapolate and say they are a great university for Quantum Engineering especially over other Quantum research, but I don't have quite enough data to stand by that.\n\nI did find that in their [FAQs](https://quantum.mines.edu/program/) they provide a link to schedule a Zoom call to speak to them about the program, if you're interested.\n\nOne final note (since at this point I'm just dumping whatever's coming into my head), though I didn't have any personal experience with it, the International Student Services office I hear is pretty good and supportive of, well, international students. I think international students make up roughly 7% of the student body, but don't quote me on that. Point is, just from an international student perspective, Mines gets a lot of international students (mostly students from the Middle East in the Petroleum Engineering program from what I know) and I hear provides good resources and support for them. But again, I wasn't involved, so I don't have any personal experience with it.\n\nI don't know how well that answered your question, but I hope it helped.",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm a prospective senior in high school, and I've already been accepted to Mines and I'm probably going to accept. I've heard about Themed Learning Communities, and since I'm pretty dedicated to my school's orchestra as a cellist, I was considering applying for the Visual and Performing Arts Themed Learning Community. Is it worth it? Does it have any extra benefits for someone who wants to perform?  And, if it isn't worth it, then is there a residence hall you guys recommend? I watched the video discussing each one but I'm still not sure.\n\nIn addition, are there any classes that I would have to take to be in the Mines orchestra? Maybe a music minor I would be required to complete?\n\nAlso, other posts have said that the Mines orchestra is really laid back and if that's the case, is there a more rigorous one near Mines that I could join while still living on campus? I really want to continue playing the cello I'm just not sure how to continue to challenge myself with it while at Mines since its more engineering focused than most schools.",

The previous orchestra teacher just stepped down at the end of this semester, so things might change, but I don't have any knowledge from the inside to offer. If you looks at the Mines course catalog (you can Google for it), music is listed under LIMU, with some classes like music theory listed under humanities (HASS).",

            "comment": "VPA alum here. B.Sc in Physics, minor in music technology. Played in orchestra/band/jazz/choir/lots of small ensembles. The music directors will probably be able to name me based on that description \ud83d\ude05\n\nThe main benefit is that you're living with other artsy folks. This helps a lot with making friends (which is a huge priority your first month or so of college), and also sets you up with connections to other artists on campus. \n\nIt doesn't provide any kind of benefit to an orchestra/band/choir/etc member, but the connections it can provide might open opportunities outside of the music classes themselves. I got involved with pit orchestra because my theater friends told me who was directing the music. I got into high grade (the CSM arts journal) because someone in my floor needed an accompanist for their poetry/rap.\n\nAs for the \"seriousness\" of the orchestra, it really depends on what you put into it. This *is* a STEM school and that's everybody's first priority. But there are opportunities for those who want to put more effort in. There's usually a string quartet that plays several small gigs a semester (often at alumni association events, so lots of networking potential there). We had a cello choir my first semester because we had a ton of cellists that year. There's a Music Technology minor, but that's mostly about the science behind recording studios (not exclusively that, but it's the main focus). And while it is a laid back environment, the directors do push you and make you play real music. We did The Planets, Barber's Adagio for Strings, Peer Gynt, The Barber of Seville, and plenty more that I can't recall off the top of my head. \n\nAs a serious lifelong musician myself, still performing after graduating and getting my big boy job, the laid back CSM music department is what I needed to stay on touch with music while going through the rigorous engineering curriculum. At times I could barely manage my course load with the laid back orchestra, let alone a super rigorous one. I ended up quitting a band I was in outside of CSM because I couldn't handle that much time commitment.",

            "comment": "I was in VPA for 2021-2022 so it was slightly different for me because of COVID but from my experience, it's basically just an opportunity to live with people who have common interests. Sometimes they plan activities (bob ross painting, going to see a theatre show, etc.) and the RA gets some funding to do that but there are no obligations to show up or anything, it's just for fun. The only thing is that your roommate also has to be in the VPA, so if you had someone specific you wanted to room with beware of that.\n\nI don't think there's really any benefit to being in the VPA as far as getting connected goes. In my experience higher-ups in the performing arts department weren't involved at all, it was more like just a community of kids who liked to do things performing arts related, and our RA was really the only one leading things. There's also lots of musical people at Mines that don't go through VPA who you'll find playing pianos, performing library concerts, etc. so don't think you need to be in the VPA to find those people (I'm pretty sure a cellist performed a library concert this semester). I actually spent a lot of time doing music/art while I was in VPA but didn't really participate much in the actual VPA-organized activities.\n\nI think being in the VPA was a good first-year experience because my roommate (who I found beforehand) also got into the VPA and we connected over lots of other things besides music/art. The people in the VPA also all got to chat before we moved in so it was nice to be familiar with some people before living with them for a year. Other than that community aspect I don't think there's a huge benefit to being in the VPA, but I had a positive experience and am glad I chose to be in it.",

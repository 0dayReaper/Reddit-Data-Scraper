I'm also concerned about Energy and Society because I don't know how bad the workload is going to be or how much participation is required. If they're taking a grade for attendance or giving out long writing assignments almost every week, I will have to reconsider that one.",

Both are massive time sinks and the homework each is a solid 3-4 hour endeavor a week if not more. Manufacturing processes varies heavily from a pushover to a pain in the ass depending on the professor. I graduated last year so I don\u2019t remember which prof was bad but ask around.",

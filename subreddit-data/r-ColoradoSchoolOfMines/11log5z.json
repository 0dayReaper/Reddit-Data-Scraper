It wasn't until career fair of my last semester at school that I got picked up by a company. \n\nSince you go to mines, assuming your GPA isn't trash, every employer is having a hard time deciding who to hire out of the several dozens of candidates, so they look for other things: your people skills, how well you carry yourself, your initiative. \n\nIn this post you have demonstrated to me that while you may have drive to apply to several places, you don't carry yourself very well, and that you may not be the best person for the job because your personality might drag others down. \n\nInstead try believing in yourself. You may not even get a job in your field when you graduate. If that doesn't happen, then oh well. Get a temporary job to support yourself while you network and find the job you want. Life is not a race. \n\nYour value isn't based off of the decisions of others. It's based on your actions. Right now you're in a rut. Both high and low value people get here. You may feel down, or even worthless right now. That doesn't make you a low value person. The difference is that high value people don't give up. So far you've shown that you haven't given up yet even if you're contemplating it. Obviously, you should take breaks from time to time to keep your sanity, but never lose hope of living a good life, even if it's not the one you planned to live.",

I work for a local city government and we are desperate for people in all sorts of fields. We're doing hiring bonuses and even with that, we're struggling to find people to hire. \n\nAlso, many companies don't care about your GPA at all, it's not important. If it's under 3.0, just don't put it on your resume. Also make sure your resume is one page, no more. And make a different version of your resume for each job you apply to. If the job posting says, requirements A, B, and C, you can practically copy that list (if you have those skills) so that you're just an easy hire because it's obvious you fit what they're looking for.\n\nAlso, nobody wants to hire a student who is still in school. They want full time employees who have graduated already. And they want you to start next week. So, I almost guarantee you'll have better success in a couple months after you're done with school. All the work you've done so far, applying to jobs, call that practice. The real job search begins once you actually graduate. Real jobs don't hire students, so once you graduate it will be a whole lot easier.\n\nLike me right now, I am hiring. But I wouldn't hire a student. But I would 100% hire somebody who graduated a week ago, especially from Mines. Mines still has a great reputation in the front range area.\n\nLast thing, it's also OK if you don't get a job right away. It might take a few months, even after you graduate. But that's ok. Your worth as a person is much longer term than that. A couple months of unemployment is not a big deal.",

Every position in my career has come through networking, be it friends, family, friends or acquaintances through mutual hobbies / interests. \n\nIt is difficult, just cold calling and sending resumes off into the ether.  While people will say there are so many resources available, they also fail to acknowledge the fact that because of this, it's a much more competitive job market.  Also, because of this, creativity is sometimes required to find another angle into industry.  \n\nI like the Mike Rowe dirty jobs approach.  So much of the mantra out there these days is on finding your passion, not settling etc.  That's all we see on social media these days.  It's all bullshit, and frankly somewhat toxic.\n\n There's other avenues and paths to allow people to get there that aren't straight lines.  I'm talking jobs like the Peace Corp, Armed and unarmed services, etc:. Small companies don pay as well, but can gain you a ton of experience.  \n\nYou got this.   You're finishing up at Mines and that is something that very few people have accomplished.\n\nDetails on background, major, etc are needed to give further advice.   PM if you like.",

    "postText": "Does anyone have confirmation of whether the Red Rocks equivalent for Global Studies is LIT202 or HIS247? Because I feel like it changed recently multiple times. Like it used to be his247 but then I remember a few months ago they stressed that it's no longer transferrable. But now when I check it says his247 is the equivalent again. So I am kind of confused. Thanks",

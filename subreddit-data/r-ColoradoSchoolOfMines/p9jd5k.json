The first few meetings will be slightly logistical in nature, but beyond the first meeting, there will almost certainly be a one-shot every week, barring some extraneous circumstances. During the pandemic was difficult as we had to transition to online, but we are planning on being back in person this year.\nWe also have a Discord server here, so feel free to join and ask questions: https://discord.gg/JRS8mPab\n\nWe look forward to hopefully seeing you around!",

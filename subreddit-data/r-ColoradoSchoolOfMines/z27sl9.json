Was never really taught anything, didn\u2019t have any actual lecture and instead was emailed slides to read with rather obtuse math that didn\u2019t have work shown without skipping random steps. This may have changed since the remote days but unless you\u2019re already experienced and interested in AI/ML I would not recommend the course.",

I know at the bottom of the MechE flowchart on the department website, it lists out all of the class options for major electives, and a lot of them are EBGN classes like engineering economics, business analysis, management, etc. Those are much easier than a lot of the typical STEM classes, from my understanding. I even took an extra math class as my last elective for MechE and found it much more straightforward and manageable than most of my MechE courses. I only bring it up because I've been burnt out hard before, and I know I would have done well to take some easy electives instead of plowing through the conventional ones.",

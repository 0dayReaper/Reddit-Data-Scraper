    "postText": "Trying to make the decision on which mid-level HASS I should go with, does anyone have experience with either one? For reference they are Intermediate Poetry Writing with Mairead Case and International Relations with Elizabeth Davis respectively. Which one is more difficult? Will I hate both of them? Thanks for the help!",

She is a expert in her field and her entire family is engineers so she gets the struggle and is accordingly kind. \n\nThat aside, I took her 400 level Asian Dev course last semester and it holds the rare accolade of being a course I actually ENJOYED going to. Her 300 level course will probably be pretty easy seeing as how her 400 was also quite easy.",

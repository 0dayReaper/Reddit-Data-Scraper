Plus its such a small major so you\u2019re kind of forced to get to know your classmates cos you\u2019re stuck with them through your time at Mines. A lot of courses are only offered once a semester and only one section.",

They\u2019re one of the smallest departments on campus (although mine is smaller) and have probably somewhere of 80 undergrad total, so statistically, you\u2019re just not going to run into them as often. As well, since this sub is 50% incoming students anyway, most of them probably aren\u2019t too concerned about declaring majors yet, thus don\u2019t ask about it yet.\n\nI\u2019m not a geology major, but I do work and interact with the department a lot since I\u2019m a major of a similar nature! If you have some general questions, feel free to dm me! I can answer some of them, or probably direct you to someone who you could email.",

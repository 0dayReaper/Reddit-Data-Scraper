    "postText": "I got a severe injury to my leg yesterday, we're unsure if it's a small fracture, a bad high ankle sprain, or a torn/ruptured tendon. Regardless, I can't walk and am on crutches, spent most of a day getting assessed, and cannot focus on studying due to pain. I have a final Monday and my professor told me if I want to get it delayed I have to go through the \"proper official channels\", which I'm assuming is disability services. I submitted an application but they don't open till Monday morning. Is this the correct process or is there something else I can do?",

Tickets are free and you can get them via this link: [https://mines.universitytickets.com/w/event.aspx?id=1686&amp;r=59ed6ce43e704126ac3c8efc7515ab8c](https://mines.universitytickets.com/w/event.aspx?id=1686&amp;r=59ed6ce43e704126ac3c8efc7515ab8c)\n\nIf it looks like you can't get tickets it's likely because you aren't signed in. \n\nWe've worked really hard on this for the past few months so please come! It should be a really fun time!",

That being said, we currently have over 300 sign-ups so the event should be pretty large and should be a blast regardless!",

    "postText": "Hi, I am an incoming transfer student from CU (kind of.) I have always planned on majoring on something in STEM but I've been going between pure math and mechanical engineering for a while. I think I've finally decided on being a mechie (especially since I'm transferring) but I have some questions for those that have chosen to go that route at Mines.\n\nI'm choosing to do engineering because I'd really like to get into designing sports equipment. My mentor advised me to focus on studying polymers and composites. I know there is a metallurgy/materials science major at Mines, but I am not as interested in the industrial applications that the major seems to focus on. My first question--do mechies have opportunities to take classes that focus in materials science? Are those mostly upperclassman electives? If you have any experience with classes specifically focusing on polymers or composites as an engineer, I'd love to hear about them.\n\nI am also pretty passionate about math. I know that Mines is not known for its pure math department, the extent of it seemed to be abstract alg and analysis. Are there opportunities as well to study higher level math even as an engineer? I'm interested, for example, in taking PDEs, or a numerical solutions class. Are those generally reserved for applied math majors or is that allowed for engineering students as well? (If there are any math lovers out there that are well-versed in the department, I'd love to chat.)\n\nI have contacted the registrar and my advisor and have received no response. I would really appreciate any insight you could give me :)",

            "comment": "Numerical methods was an optional class for undergraduate ChemE\u2014very applied mathematics and computation based. I think it might be part of the required curriculum for grad students. \n\nPDEs is available as a grad class; we certainly had some ad-hoc exposure to it in upper level undergrad. You can get waivers for entry into grad classes with a relatively low amount of bureaucratic bs if you can demonstrate the prerequisite skills. \n\nHonestly, unless you\u2019re looking for some sort of professional certification of your advanced math skills; all of what you seek can be found online for free and self-paced. MIT has an awesome open course program with recorded lectures by the top faculty, psets and exams with solutions. Harvard, Stanford, lots of big name universities have followed suit. \n\nIt sounds like you have an advanced hobbyist level interest in advanced math, so I\u2019d stick that route and let the engineering degree put food on your table. \n\nConsider carefully what aspect of \u201csporting equipment design\u201d You want to be involved with. Material selection (Materials Eng.) is one part of that. Physical shape and function is another (Mech. E). Aesthetics and marketing might be more Industrial Design than engineering. Engineers tend to specialize. \n\nAlso consider your options if that doesn\u2019t work out as a career. A Mech E degree is hella versatile and can be a ticket into a lot of different industries. Materials E is somewhat more niche.",

Engineers I know in the field said I should major in mech e with a focus on CAD and materials science. From what they were saying it sounds like the materials aspect of that is pretty closely intertwined with form and function, especially in boots.",

                            "comment": "Super cool. Sounds like you're on the right track--Mech E is really the way to go here; I was a ChemE so I can't speak to whether the MME dept has a minor or will allow you to take classes as electives but I'd think that they'd love to help you out. Reading the major curriculum should give you an idea if the material you're seeking is covered and in how much depth. \n\nThe professors at Mines love to see intrepid students taking an interest in their work. At worst, they don't mind taking your money to sit a class. Although you're not supposed to do it, I don't think I ever saw anyone enforce who's actually signed up for a class if you want to informally audit one--just don't be a dick and take a signed-on student's seat.\n\nI'll speak as a semi-seasoned engineer here: DESIGN FOR MANUFACTURING is a huge fuckin' deal. I used to work as a process engineer on a new product and process team and we'd have very enthusiastic discussions with product designers and toolmakers about what's physically possible (and at what cost). I don't know much about manufacturing of skis, but ski boots are an injection molded product and the cost of mold tooling for those is substantial--well into hundreds of thousands of dollars depending on what tolerances, number of cavities, slides, etc. are required to get a good fill and freeze and a clean ejection. I'd really highly recommend getting an internship at a moldmaker, or with process engineer at an injection-molding plant so you can understand the challenges faced on the manufacturing side when you sit at the computer drawing up designs for cool shit.\n\nOne of my mentors--a molding engineer--used to make ski boots and had lots of fun stories. :)",

One of the engineers I talked to is a head developer at K2 and he more emphasized the marketing/testing aspects of boot development. What I'm really interested in though is what you mentioned--the actual design and production. I am not experienced in CAD to any real degree, so I definitely agree that having solid knowledge of the process would be helpful.\n\nAnother engineer said the companies look for interns around junior/senior year. Will I be expected to have any sort of injection molding or specific plastics knowledge? I would love to start learning early on in my undergrad career but tbh I haven't gotten the feeling I have a lot of flexibility in my first two years. When can I take design for manufacturing?\n\nThanks again :)",

I\u2019m only sharing some of my salt earned on the job. \n\nNobody really expects interns to know very much haha, but yes, internship recruiting is usually done for junior and senior summer.\n\nAnother alternative you may explore is to land a 2nd shift job as a molding operator. It\u2019s kinda a sucky job but then the more empathy you have as to the difficulties of the jobs of the people making the stuff you design, the better. If it\u2019s a really good company they\u2019ll pay part of your tuition, too.",

I have no clue how I can look at apartments that will be available in July 2022 but it feels like I need to be planning ahead for this. How do people normally go about finding apartments? Is anyone able to pass down their lease to me? I need advice \u2014 I don\u2019t know where to start",

Sophmore housing through the school generally opens in early February. You are absolutely right that postings are not very common right now, but you will start to have more luck around March or April. In the meantime, if you can find people to transfer leases that's great, but most lease transfers are done for rooms out of a house. It sounds like you want to live on your own?",

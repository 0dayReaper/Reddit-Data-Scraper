I\u2019ve been feeling pretty defeated recently trying to maintain a \u2018good\u2019 GPA and feel like I won\u2019t be able to get into grad school. I rarely hear people from mines discuss applying to grad school and am looking for some success stories of non 4.0 holding mines grads that went to grad school to give me some hope :,) thanks y\u2019all",

Finding your interests and reaching out to professors at the grad school before applying is great.\n\nI got plenty of rejections too, don't let them discourage you!",

This can be very helpful for your application. Also, do you have meaningful engagement in an extracurricular activity? You do not need to have multiple extracurriculars on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Rather, one activity where you demonstrate a deep commitment and/or a leadership role will help you stand out to an admissions committee. Best of luck!",

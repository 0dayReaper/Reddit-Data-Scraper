I've 2+ years of relevant field experience in energy sector and now I'm doing a master's program.\nDoes anyone know if it's possible to get an internship during my 1st semester(fall 2022) or do I need to wait till summer? If yes then where to find an internship related to the energy sector?(I'm already looking at LinkedIn, Indeed)",

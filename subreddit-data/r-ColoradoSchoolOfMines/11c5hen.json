So does this mean an employer views CSM as good as one of the other schools mentioned above. If there were two equal candidates for a stem related job from each school, would the guy from MIT be picked first?",

For mechanical engineering it's good, but it really isn't at that level reputation-wise. I don't think having Mines on your resume is going to have *nearly* the same effect for mechanicals that having Caltech/Stanford/MIT on there would, but I think it does factor into the employer's decision. Ime it's more of a cherry on top if you're already decently qualified and/or interview well.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a prospective student in the process of picking a college, and Mines sits near the top of my list of choices. However, most of the other schools I\u2019m considering are located in particularly open-minded regions, or have a strong LGBTQ+ community, but I haven\u2019t seen as much of that from Mines. I know Mines has an active oSTEM organization, but that\u2019s about it. I was hoping to glean some knowledge from LGBTQ+ students as to their experience at Mines, and if they felt threatened/supported. Also, how does Golden feel about the matter, I haven\u2019t really been able to pinpoint its leanings. I appreciate any and all responses, and I hope you\u2019re having a lovely day :)",

            "comment": "Gay alumni here. Started in 2015 so relatively recent. \n\nLike some of the other commenters have pointed out, Mines as a whole has a very neutral response to LGBT stuff on campus. I was never a part of oSTEM but I know that it was a helpful resource to others and I think it helped me put myself out there and meet other LGBT people when I walked with them in the pride parade in 2017. \n\nDorm life was pretty good! I lived in the traditional halls and although I held off on telling everyone, the people I did tell were very open minded across the board regardless of what religious, political, etc background they came from. My roommate was a super religious dude from the western slopes but he was super accepting and one of my best friends in college. The 1 or 2 on my floor who I knew weren\u2019t quite as accepting I just wasn\u2019t friends with and never told. \n\nMajor also plays a big role here. I was a Bio/ChemE and my major was very LGBT heavy (probably like 10% of people in the major?) compared to the rest of the school and so I made a lot of LGBT friends that way as well. \n\nOverall, I think the way Mines treated LGBT folks aligned with how I intend to live my gay life, which is, no different than anyone else on campus. Between all of the people I came out to in the dorms, music groups/programs, my fraternity, and my major, I never had a negative response to a coming out experience. I think that in itself says a lot.",

You might try a search of the sub.  \n\nSpeaking on Golden, however, I\u2019d say the town is pretty indifferent. Denver seems fairly progressive on the matter.

The overall consensus is that dating is hard (especially for my gay guy friends, I've noticed) but no one is actively for or against it. I feel like I've totally found my crew though and you'll definitely find yours if you decide to come here. Besides, it's easy to get to both Denver and Boulder if you want more of an LGBTQ+ dating scene (Tracks is awesome and I see lots of queer Mines students there on college nights).",

Most seem fine but there have been multiple people who've basically been harassed/bullied until they had to move back into LGBT housing. OSTEM is pretty active and full of a lot of good people as well :)",

I've been presenting female since I got here and I also started hormone therapy while attending.\n\nJust a freshman about to finish my first year, the gender inclusive housing has been pretty good! Everyone living in the section is really nice and we all take care of each other, and you get to meet a lot of other LGBTQ+ people just there. I can't say I know much about OSTEM, because I've only been attending during COVID. However I will say I've seen multiple (like 3-4) students move to my floor in Elm from other dorm halls due specifically to homophobic bullying, so it's definitely an issue in other dorm halls at least. But hard to say how bad of an issue it is, considering class sizes and all. Oh and with the name change, it was super easy for me to change my name and gender in Mines' system, despite them not being my legal ones. However a trans friend of mine has found very little luck with either of these, and has repeatedly asked for them to be changed in the system with little luck.",

            "comment": "Mines is pretty purple. I think people across the political spectrum will find something here that pisses them off. It's by no means outright liberal (at least by my assessment), but you will see professors and staff state their preferred pronouns, you'll get emails about mental health emergencies and LGBT issues, a lot of people wear masks, there are trans students, etc. One thing that might trigger you (but in general the cons I know do an okay job gritting their teeth and powering through) is you have to actually learn what Marxism is in Global Studies, and the HASS professors in general lean that way. NHV is also essentially an ethics class, so you might have to write an essay about a moral dilemma that you feel some type of way about through a specific lens of moral philosophy that you personally reject. But tbh that's standard college stuff; learning about other worldviews and how to think through them. You'll probably have to seek an explicitly conservative school to avoid all of that. Conversely, I don't think you'll find too much to complain about from the engineering profs; most are politically/socially uninterested STEM nerds, and I kind of get a conservative whiff about more than a handful I've had. Plus, Mines is a very industry-minded school. Private industry and job placement is emphasized all throughout the curriculum, so that might resonate with you. \n\nBut try not to get pissy about differences. Many *many* conservatives have gone through college and lived to tell the tale, and if you are not insecure in your beliefs you should have no problem putting them aside to learn about people and cultures and other ways of living and thinking and shit. The more you know, right?",

There's also some racist/sexist people on campus, as well. I'm sure you'd get along with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFortunately, Mines is definitely somewhat liberal. We have some LGBTQ organizations, minority organizations, female organizations (women in stem for example). It's definitely a little bit more conservative than places like UC Denver, Boulder, Anschutz (anschutz is definitely very liberal because we view diversity as helpful in improving health outcomes).",

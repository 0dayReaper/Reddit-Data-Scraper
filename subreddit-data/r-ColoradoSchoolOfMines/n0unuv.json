            "comment": "According to the school's respective websites, mines MechE graduates can expect on average $20,000 more on their starting salary.\n\nAnd the Mines MechE program is rated #4 best valued engineering schools in the country, which looks good on any job application. \n\nOther notable things: Mines MechE has a dedicated prosthetics lab, ties to the Space Resources program (first of it's kind in the nation), and a bounty of paid undergrad research opportunities.\n\nBeyond that, the CS program here is excellent as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only things you should factor in: the social atmosphere at mines is VERY different to CU Boulder. The classwork here is significantly harder as well, regardless of your major. If you're not dead set on having a STEM major mines might not be the place, because there's not a whole lot else offered.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, it can be rough but if you\u2019ve got friends taking the same classes as you, it\u2019s much easier and you learn more form group studying. I considered boulder as well but at the end of th day realized that 1) holy shit boulders engineering building is a depressing concrete coffin and 2) it\u2019s not something that was pointed out to me but going to a school with ALL engineers is really nice because you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re missing out on the \u201ccollege experience\u201d because your business major friends with half as much work as you fuck about and have more free time. At mines, we all suffer together.",

However, Mines recently added two faculty who specialize in high rate behavior (impacts and explosives). After looking at the programs/faculty  it doesn't look like that option exists at Boulder. \n\nIf you want to get into research as an undergrad that could be something you want to consider. I know my lab will be eager for undergrads in the near future.",

            "comment": "I attend mines as a mechanical engineering undergraduate, and I have a large number of friends that have graduated from both programmes (mines and boulder) in the major. All of my peers at mines can have a summer internship after sophomore year if they'd like, and especially have been able to find work after graduation. I cannot say the same about the people I've seen graduate from boulders program. That said, the quality of student definitely affects it, but I find hirers in the Denver area seek out our graduates above boulder graduates.",

A lot of Mines folks end up at Lockheed, too, but SNC, Ball, and ULA are waaaaaay more active in the space/aerospace community at Mines. \n\nThen, it's been my experience that smaller engineering companies all over Colorado really like Mines and buy into the brand, so to speak. I've received way more interest from these small companies than from the large megacorps, and I'll be interning for one this summer despite having no experience relevant to their line of work.",

            "comment": "Some random thoughts:\n\n-For MechE, Mines and Boulder are basically equivalent as far as content and pace of courses go. My roommate goes to Boulder for MechE, and our classwork has looked  pretty much the same (except for the design sequence, see below). It seems like Mines profs do grade harder, though.\n\n-Since it's usually a factor in the Boulder vs Mines dillema, I'll weigh in on the prestige/name recognition thing in my target industry (space industry). For the average student, Mines MechE has a definite, slight-to-moderate advantage over CU Boulder *in* Colorado, with OOS prestige up for grabs. Boulder has a greater nationwide presence in that industry, but Mines is fairly well known amongst engineers (we all saw it in those \"Great Colleges for B-Students\" lists when we were applying to school; same deal with the engineers who will be hiring you). So yeah, at least in the space industry, Mines MechE seems definitely but maybe only slightly more sought after than Boulder MechE. I know of some Boulder students who are putting most Mines students to shame in that industry, though, so just know that the school name alone will not carry you.\n\n-The design sequence at Mines can be a pain in the butt, but it is basically what separates Mines from Boulder. You get a lot more hands on experience with CAD, machining, PCBs, design, prototyping, etc much earlier than the Boulder folks. Thus, what the other commenter said about sophomores at Mines getting internships is true; by that point, most students have a lot of project experience to put on their resume. \n\n-The Mines network is not the hottest for MechE, outside of extraction industries. I don't think this is an issue for most people, but if you have more involved business aspirations (e.g co-founding a startup, getting substantial ownership of a growing company, etc) CU Boulder is *definitely* better for that sort of networking/shmoozing intensive stuff (again, I can only speak to my experience in the space industry). Like I said though, this isn't a problem for finding general employment.",

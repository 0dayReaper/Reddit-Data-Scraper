    "postText": "Hello Mines Community!\n\nSeveral of my roommates will be moving out at the end of this semester, and I'll have a couple of rooms opening in my house. \n\nIt's a 4 bedroom, 2 bath house in Lakewood. The drive to Mines takes 10-25 minutes depending on traffic and weather (but it's usually on the shorter side). We share the entire unit with 2 others who live in the separate, downstairs unit of the house. They're very kind but we also don't tend to see them very often. We have a fairly large driveway, big enough for everyone to have a car, and even room for one car in a garage. The inside of the unit is pretty big, especially considering rent. Our living room is great for movie nights, and the kitchen is both spacious and well-equipped. In terms of utilities, we have 2 refrigerators as well as a washer and dryer.\n\nYou would be joining myself (a CS Master's student) as well as my Undergraduate friend. We are one man and one woman, so our roommate search is not restricted by gender! We're fairly outgoing and are looking for friends as well as roommates. We would like roommates who like to keep their place relatively clean. Of course, we're not perfect, it doesn't need to be spotless. We both enjoy gaming on PC and Switch, a variety of genres. TV show binging will also likely be a common occurrence. \n\nThis is also a very pet-friendly household. I currently live here with my hedgehog Linus, and we're planning on getting a cat in the near future. Additional animals are welcome as long as they would be okay with the aforementioned cat and hedgehog. Note, however, that all pets may be subject to an Animal Security Deposit of $500, possible one-time Animal Fee, and possible monthly Animal Rent.\n\nRent prices are currently shifting a bit, but it is likely to be under $750 monthly. We tend to split the rent evenly 4-ways. There is a small $30 fee to apply, this comes from [Apartments.com](https://Apartments.com). Please do not hesitate to DM me or respond to this post, I'm happy to answer any/all questions you may have. We can arrange for you to come visit, or we could give you a virtual tour if you're not nearby.",

            "comment": "The two most common class durations are ~50 minutes for classes held three times a week (say, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), and ~1.25 hours for those held twice a week (e.g Tuesday and Thursday).\n\nMost courses will have options that meet 3x a week and 2x a week, so you can choose whichever you prefer. Some courses are only available in 2x/week sessions; notably, most courses in the design sequence.\n\nThe number of classes per day depends on your course load and preference. I reeeeeaaaally prefer 3x/week classes, so usually Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays I'll have 3-4 classes. Then on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I'll only have 1 class (again, usually from the design sequence). Some people like to spread them out more evenly; just preference.\n\nMost courses have options available throughout the day, so if you're an early-riser you can enroll in like 7:00am classes, or you can enroll in later classes if you want (which end at 8:00pm I believe, but don't quote me on that). \n\nWhen it comes time to schedule, I recommend you hit up ratemyprofessor to read reviews of the different profs for your class. Pick allllll the best ones you can.\n\nEdit: 2x/week classes are usually 1 hour and 15 minutes",

MWF classes are 50 minutes, while TR classes are 75 minutes. Labs that occur once a week are usually 3-4 hours long. I had about 3 classes max a day. One in the morning, one right after or an hour later, and then a class in the early afternoon after lunch. There is much flexibility in making schedules in college, but I suggest you consider your preferences. I liked having some classes back to back and then going home, as I could just do all the hw then. I also liked having a gap for lunch and going to the gym before a class.",

    "postText": "Anyone else not eating as much as last semester? Looking back on the last few weeks I've been averaging one meal a day. I think this is party because campus doesn't have any \"affordable\" ie less than $12 meal options, and honestly I haven't had the time. Between work and school I have around 2 hours of free time during the week.\n\n\nI know the solution is meal planning but I ultimately wish campus could bring back affordable meal options.\n\nAnd the meal plans are close to affordable at around 7.50 per meal but let's me honest I don't know if that counts as food.",

This fall is the worst I\u2019ve ever seen it, longer lines for everything and mines market is always running out of breakfast. Today at 9:15 grillworks was out and 10 people in line for the waffle irons, really feels like the school is neglecting us. The food is worse in quality AND they\u2019re charging us more for it. And using all plastic when there\u2019s a conveyer belt dish machine sitting right there that literally never runs. I\u2019ll never forget the days of custom omlets, froyo in brown and smoothies in the rec center. Sodexo is pathetic",

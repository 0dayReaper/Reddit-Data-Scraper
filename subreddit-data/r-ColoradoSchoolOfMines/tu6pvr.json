I want to know what tests will be like and if it's worth or if I should just do the homework like I'd do the tests (so is the nspire allowed on tests)?\n\nEE for reference",

We (civil) all got through fine with, usually, a Casio FX-115ES, which one of the civil professors always recommends as a good FE calculator (and therefore good to learn to use early on).",

It's expensive, but with the amount of time and headaches it saves me from, it is worth more to me than anything else I have for school. I rarely ever graph in it (I can't even remember how), but the advanced functions are incredibly useful. Also to answer your question, I've been able to use it on all my tests where they allow you to bring your own calculator. \n\nSome might argue that you can get by just fine with a regular calculator, and they're correct, but I highly recommend getting one.",

I also transferred in, so not all my classes were at Mines, so keep that in mind too.\n\nMy take is this: You really don\u2019t need a nice calculator, I just bought it because I wanted to splurge and it looked fun. If that\u2019s the kind of splurge purchase that sounds fun to you then I highly recommend the calculator, it\u2019s amazing! But it won\u2019t get you through school any better than a basic TI. You also will need other calculators for some exams, including the FE (should you chose to take it).  \n\nI hope that helps! Good luck!!",

I\u2019m not a good programmer by any stretch but I can apply myself because I recognize how useful a skill it can be. \n\nBut 101 basically takes tenuously related CS concepts and mashes them into one course, offering nothing but brief and high level overviews of a multitude of concepts. The course design lacks focus the way other classes might. \n\nIt just feels like an afterthought and idk, as I get older I\u2019ve gotten less tolerant of that sort of thing.

Also learning one language helps you learn every language there after. While it may seem useless now, knowing python is an incredibly valuable resume add and I know a few friends who use it in their daily work (mechE and finance majors). As a graduated cs major at mines, in my opinion there is no better language to teach non-cs majors than python. But I\u2019m also sure 101/102 is most likely a waste of time and taught poorly knowing the CS department at mines.",

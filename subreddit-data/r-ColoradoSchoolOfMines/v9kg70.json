Your rights to not disclose are way more important.\n\nThis is Merica for God's sake.  \n\nI know some people are pretty dense on here so I was being sarcastic.\n\nJust fill out the damn form.  Do your part to be a decent human.\n\nDon't be like this peice of shit above.",

You know how many shots I got when I went into the service, you know how much shit I had to disclose as a Special Forces recruit.  Fuck you.  Service men and women don't fight for your rights to be a shitty human to everyone else.  My rights, my rights, when talking about TB?

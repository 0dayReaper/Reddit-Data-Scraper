It has two doors, one on the highway-facing side of the building and one on the other side. Both have ramps going up to them, I believe.\n\nThere are quite a few other doors on the building, but it's also a large rehearsal space and facilities/shipping",

If you want a piano, there's one in the upstairs of the student center in the first ballroom, one in bunker auditorium, one in maple and weaver, and the one in brown of course.\n\nIn my opinion, the best place to play music is in brown. There's a community of regular musicians that play there, and the people who study in there aren't worried about loud music because they're choosing to study in the one public place on campus meant for music.",

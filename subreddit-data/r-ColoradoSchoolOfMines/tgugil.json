    "postText": "Intro to Sci comp makes hw due at 5pm and often only gives students access to them at the start of class. I get this is because we are supposed to work on them during class but it's hard todo when there's a lecture going on. I can't take notes, do the in class, and pay attention all at once.\n\nSo instead I skip class stay home and finish the assignment, where it's quite and I can focus. This would need to be the case if it was due at midnight. Instead of being due at 5pm or right when I get off from work. Also some of the major hw assignments are due at 5 and it just puts added stress on me to finish it.",

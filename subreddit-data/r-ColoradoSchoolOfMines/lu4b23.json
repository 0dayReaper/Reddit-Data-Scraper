The worst that can happen is that the post is removed. \n\nAny way, down to the business:\n\nI am wondering if any of you are Eastern Orthodox. I know that there is a Catholic club, as well as numerous protestant clubs on campus. If one is looking to get to know other Orthodox Christians, however, there doesn't seem to be any options currently, which is why I ask. If you are a part of the EOC, I would be interested in getting to know you. Feel free to DM me.\n\nThanks,\n\nWoollyMammothMan",

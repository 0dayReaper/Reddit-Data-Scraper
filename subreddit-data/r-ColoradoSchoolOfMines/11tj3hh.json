    "postText": "I am a junior in high school here in colorado and plan to go to CU boulder or mines for mechanical engineering. I was wondering if anyone in the program or the school had any thoughts or advice about living on campus or off campus, the food, the classes, and the professors. Whats student life like? Stuff like clubs. I see classes called physical activities courses and I don't see that at CU. What are they? Is a freshmen dorm required? I currently have a good GPA and college credits from high school, will those matter? Kind of just looking for a overall review of the school. Would you choose it again, why or why not?",

                    "comment": "If you're talking about CU overall, the university is comprised of 6 colleges. The median salary for people studying engineering after graduation is 86k. You can look that up from CollegeScoreCard and its also posted on the university website. The school's overall median is 51k and that is because the university graduates people with \"soft majors.\"\n\nI have never taken a class from the College of Arts &amp; Sciences, Leeds, College of Media and Communications, College of Music, etc. Those colleges themselves operate like their own campus and each have their own libraries, graduation cutoffs for honors and separate college-wide policies.\n\nFor perspective, the undergrad + grad student head count is 8,264 engineering students. This is a little more than Mines' total enrollment. 30% of Boulder engineering students are women and 39.4% are minorities. The Ann and HJ Smead Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences has over 1,000 students and they have their own campus on the east side of the university, with buildings just dedicated for aerospace students.\n\nMines is small enough that you can almost generalize the culture of the student body, but I think that's very hard to do with Boulder. This would be like saying \"someone from LA is really rich\" while ignoring that there are impoverished crime infested areas. Los Angeles is too big to \"own.\" Even at UCSB, there was just no way to typify the student body because the spectrum of students even within the same major was so diverse.",

That can be googled fyi. I got out of Chem 1 and 2, calc 1, and two HASS classes because of transfer credit.\n\nAs for the professors I have found many to be excellent. As a junior, I have had the privilege of having classes with Prof Eberhart, Ackerman, Rickey, Hisham, and Rodriquez; to name a few, and all named are world class. Sure there are some worse than others but I have yet to personally have a professor who didn\u2019t seem to care or be willing to work with me. \n\nClasses: \nIn short: if you are willing to put in more work than most others you can excel every time, in every class. \n\nLong version: In my personal opinion most classes are not overtly challenging. My lowest credit semester was first semester freshman year at 17 credits and since then I have taken between 18-19 every semester (I am doing the aerospace minor). After enduring all of that my current GPA is 3.87. However, I know that I put in much more effort than a good majority of the student body. I know many students who regular miss assignment deadlines\u2026 in college. This extra effort does come at a cost to my free time (ie I have little since I also work) so just be aware of that. \n\nHere\u2019s your nail in the coffin reason to come to mines over CU (if you are willing to make it worth your time, i.e come here for school and not to screw around): I am a Colorado resident and many of my friends chose CU over mines. None have obtained an internship, added to their resume, or have had any unique experiences while at CU. I interned with an aero company my first year, a thermal fluids company my second and have accepted an internship offer with a large aero company for the coming summer. I have worked on projects with professor Madrid, and I even competed in a global competition in which we were sponsored by Lockheed to design a lunar rover. \n\nNone of the above would\u2019ve been possible at CU. I would just be a number. Instead I have gained invaluable experience, connections, and possibly a company payed for Masters degree (pending summer) :)",

I am taking a class called Electromagnetic Waves and Transmission and we have juniors and seniors who've interned at Raytheon, Northrop Grunnam, Qorvo and other RF amplifier companies. Our professor is a Lockheed Martin Senior Researcher and can direct her students for a summer internship. I've interned sophomore year during the summer and will be interning at the same company this summer so its not actually hard if you apply yourself.",

I went to CSU for mechanical engineering. To be frank I get tired of CSM kids shitting on CSU and CU Boulder. It's mostly kids that have little to no real world industry experience. I'm a 30 year old lean process engineer in the area, recognized by Toyota MC executives for my lean process work. What I'm seeing are alot of youngsters speaking in sweeping generalizations and assumptions of entire schools based on stereotypes. In other words, fallacies and lack of critical thinking. Behaviors that do not give me favorable impressions of recent engineering graduates. Since engineers should not make generalizations or logical fallacies. I worked very hard for my BSME at CSU. Anybody who looks down on me for it can shove it. You will in all reality be working with engineers from other schools. Learn respect or humility now or it will cause you problems in the workplace. Lastly, CU has a full aerospace major and a very well known heavily NASA funded program. CSU is known for bioengineering and biomedical mechanics research. Its possible to recognize other schools strengths. I respect and admire CSM myself. And it might be my autism here, but if a potential candidate displays ego or arrogance just because of where they went, it tells me they aren't a good team player and not the best hire to work with others.",

We normally have 2 major internship fairs for STEM people during the semester and its divided into either Aerospace/Defense or Computing/Engineering.  I've been approached by Qorvo and L3Harris and got an internship over the summer and also had an interview with Lockheed Martin. One of my friends is an EE major but is interning for Amazon Web Services.\n\nIn terms of academics, CU Boulder is definitely time consuming and even if you are genius you will stumped by a problem on pset or a project that requires you to think creatively. By your junior year, almost everyone in your major with decent grades would have been approached by a recruiter.\n\nI was accepted to both Boulder and Mines but I choose Boulder because their EE program was better and Boulder is connected well with the industry. At UCSB I couldn't even get any employer's attention. The life here is pretty rough for an engineer, if you are a serious student and you want to make the top grades you don't have a lot of free time. I don't think choosing Mines over Boulder or vice versa would hinder you.",

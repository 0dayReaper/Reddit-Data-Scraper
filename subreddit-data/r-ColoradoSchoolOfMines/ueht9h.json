    "postText": "What's your experience with a full summer course load? Two classes per six week session, mostly technical. I feel like it would be busy, but not ridiculously so. I'm not the strongest studen, thought; I usually take four classes in a normal semester and definitely have to work. How comparable is the same credit load during summer? \n\nFor reference, I'm taking Solid Mech. and Intro to Prob. fpor the first summer session, then Global Studies and MEGN 201 for the second.\n\nPost-Summer Edit: Yeah it wasn't bad. Maybe a little easier than a normal semester tbh. Try to avoid early morning classes, though. One of these classes required me to wake up at like 6:00am. Another required me to stay up past midnight, every night. Combined, it caused a lot of missed sleep, poorly done assignments, and absolutely *zero* will to go to any office hours. MEGN 201 was not at all pared down for the summer lol, there was a lot of work due every night (fortunately, it was usually very easy). Solid Mech was chill, Global Studies was probably chill compared to normal semesters, but I suck at essay-based classes so it was still stressful for me. So yeah. Hope it helps any future students.",

            "comment": "I took 4 summer classes last year. It's certainly manageable but a word of advice. Don't pick classes you realllllly need to understand. I took Diff-eq, Probability 334, History of War, and Physics II over the summer and I got straight A's through them.\n\nPros:  \n\\-Some classes are vastly easier (cough cough physics) because of extra credit variations\n\n\\-It lets you take really painful classes in 3/8 the time you would be taking them\n\nCons:  \n\\-You Don't learn the important material as strongly (I'm struggling heavily in Math 335 because I didn't have a strong basis in Math 334)\n\n\\-Some classes are incredibly brutal because the summer professors grade them identical to a normal course\n\n\\-The workload is WILDLY less consistent than a typical course. For example in History of War, we spent 3 weeks where we had maybe 2 single-page essays, and then we had to write 6 essays over the span of the final 3 weeks. You really never know what you're going to get\n\n\\-The initial drop date is typically before the first exam and the final drop date is typically before the second midterm. So you have a lot more to lose than a fall course. Risk is involved.\n\n\\-The burnout is real long-term. After being in school for 5 consecutive semesters (not going to count winter break as a real break) I am completely burned out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, you can certainly succeed in a summer course load of 4 classes. But there are a LOT of inherent risks, the classes are way more unpredictable than normal course semesters, and you increase the likelihood of burnout along the way. But I for one am graduating a semester earlier because of it so I can't really say I regret it, but I certainly would never do it again.",

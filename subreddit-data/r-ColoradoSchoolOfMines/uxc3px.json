From my understanding, people in Colorado believe that Mines is the better engineering school but Boulder is a top 25 engineering school. I got into Mines for M.E. and Boulder for Aero and it's so hard to decide. Mines is a smaller tighter knit community but in California, Boulder Engineering is more well known and they have a big alumni network. Not sure which school to choose !!!",

            "comment": "As someone who grew up in CO, Mines has a better national reputation. You would be surprised how many people when I tell them I went to Colorado School of mines go oh wow that's a really good school (and I'm in the Midwest now). \n\nI chose mines over Boulder because I liked the smaller campus, and the fact that I'd be surrounded by a ton of like-minded people that are all suffering together vs going to school and meeting friends that are just partying and not caring about their schooling because they are in for an English major instead of something difficult. \n\nI had a few friends drop out of Boulder because they either party too much, or just didn't feel like they fit in, and I'm pretty confident though that they would have done fine at mines as they were wicked smart. \n\n\nThat being said, if you are planning on going to aeronautical Engineering, mines is relatively new in that field and I'll be honest most of the friends that I had that went to Boulder and wanted to be an aeronautical engineering ended up getting good jobs, but on the flip side my friends that went for mechanical at mines and got into NASA/Lockheed/and a few other well known space programs, but they were super duper into the space club at mines! \n\nHonestly I would say that program-wise I consider them equal, with mines having a bit of a lead just because of the reputation of not necessarily being a party school unlike Boulder, But I would really base your decision on the campus, do you prefer a larger school where you're surrounded by not just engineers or do you prefer a small school where the only people you meet are engineers and super (too smart for their own good) people?  Like for reference, I'm not saying we don't party or do anything dumb, but often times when my friend group would get drunk we would plan about how we take over the space station and create our own country bit off of it and how we do the engineering to figure out how to provide life support for it... I'm pretty sure my friends at CU didn't do that stupid shit \ud83d\ude02",

Over that summer I realized that because of Mines I had an extremely high work ethic, I had no problem working 12 or 14 hour days when deadlines absolutely needs to be met. ( I want to preface this by saying this was an extremely rare event) \n\nI'll be honest Mines is hard, but it's also a ton of fun. I loved working in the Mechine shop is awesome. \nOn a bit of a tangent one thing that really bothers me about csu and cu, is it they don't allow students to use the machine shop until their senior year. If you like making things in your free time this is a major blow if you go to Boulder and ultimately was the deciding factor for me.\n\nAlso the class size is small enough the teachers actually know who you are maybe not during freshman year hit in later classes.\n\nTldr\nYou'll be left with \na high work ethic,\nGreat hands on experience,\nProfessors you can be friends with.",

Class sizes, distance between housing and the campus, parking, cost of living, all those things factored into it. Mines just seemed like a smaller / cozier / quieter campus where you could more easily find a spot in the library to study or whatever. Plus, the town of Golden is really cute and small, versus Boulder which is quite large. They're both nice places though. But yeah whenever I say \"I went to Mines\" people always react with either \"you must be a genius\" or \"that's a good school\" to which I reply \"yeah it's a good school but trust me there were some dummies there\".",

I know very competent Boulder alums (my dad and half brother went there), but it's just not the same as Mines.\n\nBoulder indeed would have more alums and possibly be well known due to just having more students, but Mines is better for purely academic and functional reasons. Graduating Mines is itself a struggle, and your GPA might be shit but you will be resilient.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, we are all biased here because we're Orediggers, but Mines &gt; Boulder for school reasons. Boulder has better mental health, a more fun college culture, and will not actively make you consider hanging yourself. \n\nRegarding major, Boulder is better than Mines for Aerospace but Mines is better than Boulder for mechE.

            "comment": "First of all, are you absolutely certain that you want to do engineering? If not mines is not the school for you.\n\nBoulder is a bit larger and has options. And according to the supposed cost of attendance is a little bit cheaper. It's also much better known outside of Colorado. If you say you go to Mines outside CO, the majority of people will ask where it is or what they do out here.\n\nAs u/Totallynotthebanana said you come here to suffer with people. That is completely true. Unfortunately, a lot of the courses/ professors are set up so badly that you have to almost completely teach yourself or learn from friends that have a natural understanding. This is made even worse if you are unable to make office hours. There are also many professors that are unwilling/unable to answer questions.\n\nFrom everyone that I know that has graduated Mines really just changes your perspective so that even a heavy work week is light and less stressful than Mines. Also known as a work ethic it sadly just allows companies to treat people horribly. If companies can hire Mines grads, pay them the same and get more work out of them with less complaints, why wouldn't they?\n\nGolden itself is a pretty area. But it's quite expensive to live here and is a tourist town at it's core. Not as bad as Vail or other well known mountain towns but still for tourists.\n\nThis school may be considered good but it's still pretty poor. The administration doesn't care about you, just your money, just as any school will. The supposed hands on projects are mostly jokes, I've had to teach people which way to turn a screwdriver before. I also have to mention that even passing courses doesn't necessarily mean that students know the content. I have a friend that took a fairly intensive surveying course, yet doesn't even understand the basics on how a transit works.\n\nOverall, you'll be mostly counting on name recognition of the school to get you a job once you graduate. After that, where you went to school doesn't really matter.",

    "postText": "I know this is kind of a stupid question but I still thought I would ask it.\n\nAfter seeing my financial aid package Mines won\u2019t be an option for me unless I get significant funds from scholarships.\n\nI have a 3.86 gpa, 1480 sat, first gen student, am in state, and would definitely meet any demonstrated need requirement for any of the scholarships.\n\nEdit: also I\u2019m a white male so no qualifications in those departments. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just wondering if any current students who had similar stats could shed any light on how significant the general scholarship application can be. Is it at all likely to get 10,000+ in funds in my situation?\n\nI should also note that I\u2019m just looking at the general scholarship application right now. I do plan to apply to the E-day scholarship but they only award like 3 students or something so the odds of that are crazy.",

I think my My SAT and GPA were a little higher (genuinely don't remember) but I think you have a good shot of getting it. Best of luck!",

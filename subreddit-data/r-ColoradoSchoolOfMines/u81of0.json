    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm a prospective student from MA looking to study Mechanical Engineering, and I'm wondering how intense the workload is at Mines. I've heard online and from a student that the workload is particularly brutal and that students don't have much time for anything except academics. I want and fully expect to be challenged in college, but I need a school-life balance to be happy. Is that possible here?\n\nThanks in advance",

            "comment": "It's definitely manageable. I really only have a bad 2 or so weeks hw wise per semester, in part because I value my social life. It also depends on your expectations, because I prefer having a decent GPA (with As, Bs and the occasionalC), sleep, and a social life to being miserable with a 4.0.",

I think the workload and difficulty is a little exaggerated here, but it\u2019s certainly not easy. You\u2019ll be busy most of the time, especially around exams. But with good time management and not allowing yourself to fall behind, you\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019d say most people have a decent amount of time each day to hang out with friends, relax, and of course sleep. I\u2019m only a freshman so this is liable to change, but it\u2019s what I\u2019ve observed so far.",

            "comment": "I found the workload to be fairly brutal in select classes, and less so in others. But that difference I think comes down to personal strengths and you can only retain so much sippin from the firehouse.\n\nMy opinion is that professors are going to expect a pretty sizeable workload as a baseline average. Then it will fluctuate from class to class. How heavy each class feels will probably come down to three things:\n\n1. Do you enjoy or excel in that subject matter\n\n2. The professor \n\n3. Do you squad up with classmates from that class and knock out homework together\n\nI can't even describe the power of that last one. It's literally the most overpowered thing. Like you alone would probably do ok for most of your work. Especially if you got into Mines, you're probably a nerd lol. But you *and* your other nerdy classmates.....bruh.....the workload never stood a chance. Like literally *hours* of time get shaved off when you get stuck, and one of your squad mates goes \"oh yeah you have to do this weird middle step\". \n\nI wish you the best of luck, and wherever you go remember that STEM is a team sport. So find your people and watch the workloads get obliterated.",

Admittedly that's a skewed sample (one doesn't generally get to know people who do nothing but academics), but it's certainly possible and common to have time outside of coursework.\n\nIn my experience, the end-of-semester crunch can tend towards \"no energy/time outside of coursework\", but that's just a couple of weeks.  The rest of the semester is manageable.\n\nPersonally, as an undergrad here, I made some good friends, did a lot of hiking, and sank plenty of time into gaming, while getting enough sleep and maintaining decent grades.",

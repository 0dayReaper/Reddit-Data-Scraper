The smaller ones were definitely the most humble and willing to talk, but all of the non-primes were cool to meet. I'd say SEAKR was the most down to earth aero company there. They didn't seem to get much attention, but they do cool stuff and the people I spoke to were nice and talkative and supportive and what not. Also, the career fair plus app sucks; there were several more aero companies at the fair than the aero category of the app listed out. But yeah, no bad experiences. Anyone get to talk to Lunar Outpost?",

An (older) friend of mine went there many years ago and said it was quite conservative with a dominant white male population, is this still the case today? Thanks",

            "comment": "Still very dominant white male. I think last I checked it was around 70% male, with similar racial demographics. Probably more conservative than the average public university, but I wouldn't say that it's super conservative.   \n\n\nMines has a lot of good things about it. I graduate this month and feel that I got a great education. There are some amazing resources, professors and classes. So I don't want to say that Mines is all bad.   \n\n\nBut for me Mines was a huge sacrifice to my social life and general sense of community. In four years at Mines a perpetual sense of isolation and lonliness has been one of my biggest struggles, and I've made some \"I'll sit with you if we have lunch at the same time\" type friends, but I don't think I've met a single person I'll still be talking to a year from now.   \n\n\nMines' idea of \"improving diversity\" is getting more women into STEM. Which, since their gender ratio is abysmal I get it, but the diversity office struggles to even consider issues beyond that. Any activism or progress on LGBTQ, racial, disability, etc. issues is 100% the work of students who don't really have the time to be doing this but are anyway, ofttimes by threatening to sue the school.  \n\n\nObviously there are POC, women, and LGBTQ students, and even student  organizations for these groups. So it isn't totally straight white dudes, but Mines still lacks diversity and support for diverse students. \n\nI wouldn't say \"don't go to Mines\" but I would at least consider other options if diversity and a community of non-white dudes is important to you. I personally wouldn't go so far as to say that I \"regret\" coming to Mines. But I also doubt I would make  the same decision if I could do it all over.",

I'm pretty solidly liberal (left-libertarian) and it hasn't had any noticeable social impact.\n\nIt is still very white and very male.  The undergraduate population is about 70% white and 70% male.  The M/F ratio depends heavily on major, though; environmental engineering, for example, is 65% women.",

I can't comment on how the admin operates internally, but the admin and student culture are way better than the alternatives I know of, and the education is vastly superior to what I was getting before I transferred.  It's probably not the best school ever, but it is decisively the best that I have direct knowledge of.\n\nI'll come out to defend Mines because I get the impression that a lot of the criticisms lack context, but I have my own biases, of course--and \"better than most\" doesn't mean \"no room for improvement\".  If the admin doesn't care, that should change, but what I've heard about it at Mines is much less bad than what I've heard about at (from a friend there) Stanford.",

You'd think we were going to different universities.  I know that Mines is a hellpit for ChemEs, for example, but it's a great place for civil.\n\n&gt; My friends have advisors and professors that care about how they are doing and that they are learning, rather than purely passing the courses.\n\nAlmost all of my professors seem to care about how we're actually doing and how well we're learning.  I haven't actually interacted much with my advisor, but they're a professor whom I've had classes with and who seems to care.\n\nI do know that that's extremely variable with department.  In my experience, civil is excellent for that sort of thing.  My friends and I of course do the shared suffering thing, but I've never heard anyone complain about a professor in civil other than \"boring lecturer\".  Off the top of my head, I can list... 12 professors I've had that I think care, and that accounts for almost all of my upper-level coursework.  That also doesn't count several others about whom I've heard glowing reviews from my peers.\n\n&gt; I'd like to know where you came from that the education here is a vast improvement.\n\nUniversity of Texas at Dallas.  Here's an example: my \"calculus-based\" physics class basically used calculus to derive the kinematic equations and then had us just use algebra for everything.  I barely paid attention and had grades in the high 90s.  Thankfully, that class didn't transfer because I hadn't taken the lab; even having taken the supposed equivalent, I came in with very little advantage in Physics I here, and it would have been a major struggle to pass statics had I not retaken it.\n\n&gt; And if you think the cost is worth the improvement.\n\nDepends on individual affordability, but yes (at least for in-state tuition; I'm a Colorado resident, but UTD hands out scholarships like candy so I do pay significantly more for Mines).\n\n&gt; At this point I think it would be better to go to an easier school, get good grades and actually be able to find a job. Especially since so many companies these days seem to care about GPA as their primary factor.\n\nThat seems to be a field-by-field culture thing again.  For internships, at least, I don't put my GPA on my resume and I've never had anyone ask, and I and all my friends in civil have had no trouble at all getting at least one internship, which is leading directly into a full-time job for many of us (and into a master's thesis for me).\n\nIn civil, the Mines rigor seems to be highly valued.  I've never had anyone ask for my GPA, but my last internship recruited exclusively at Mines.",

The people I've interacted with in industry tend to have decent people skills, and civil tends to draw people who like working for the public good and are willing to accept lower pay for it.\n\nIt's not just civil, though; I've also had some fantastic professors in the geology department, good professors in mechE (dynamics) and geophysics (free elective), and I've heard (second-hand) that the mining professors are decent and the engineering physics professors are great.\n\n&gt; Physics 1&amp;2 aren't taught well and you end up learning what is actually needed in later classes.\n\nOkay, are we actually at the same school?

Of course some majors just wouldn't touch on them, but my chem 2 coursework definitely came in handy for (chiefly) fundamentals of environmental engineering.\n\n&gt; The networking means someone actually had an idea of who you were. If you don't have that GPA matters a lot more. Why do you say that mines supports networking? Is that through your department?\n\nEven just a well-supported career fair and the career prep booklet thing are a huge step up compared to UTD, where the career fair existed but was tiny and barely publicized.  Same thing for Diggernet, and I know people who got internships through it.  In general, the Mines mentality seems much more focused on industry connections.  Mines' reputation also helps there, since a lot of companies, at least in civil, will come here to network with students.\n\nThe other part, for me personally, has been through ASCE (the Mines student chapter); I don't know how well other industry association chapters do that.  People do a ton of networking with the guest speakers at ASCE meetings, and they also organize networking dinners, which is how I got my second internship (the first one was through a professor).\n\nSeveral of the guest speakers at the intro civil course also gave out contact information, and I came very close to landing an internship with one of them (had a good interview and was strongly encouraged to try again for the next round; the person who did get the spot is another Mines student I know).",

More and more females... some racial diversity.  Perception is that politics is not a visible passion there.  They say they are too busy doing math and don\u2019t want to be distracted by politics.  \n\nSilliness aside, I love the culture of Golden Colorado as a whole.  It has a \u201cmountain town\u201d feel, active people, hikers/mtn bikers etc., elegant classy educated people who are calm\nand mature, cultured and wise.  Student body can be a bit cynical and stressed but are also bright and amazing people who give me hope for humanity.",

They\u2019ve been trying to increase diversity but it\u2019s not working well; the bipoc_at_mines insta page can give you a pretty good understanding of race relations here. The main thing all students sympathize with is constant exhaustion and burnout, so since we\u2019re not the most socially adroit crew that\u2019s the prevailing conversation and point of bonding for pretty much everyone.

I\u2019ve read through every single post and never saw more than a name, however many of the submissions included the name of the submitter and not the offender. this part is my opinion, but if someone actually said or did something that was claimed, there\u2019s no reason they shouldn\u2019t be named. if they didn\u2019t say or do what was alleged, nothing actually came of the posts and therefore nothing really happened to them. \n\nagain, opinion, but I feel that the page did more good than harm (mainly because it did no harm and at least some of the stories have to be true). that being said, yeah, don't base your entire opinion of the school on one post, which goes without saying. however, there was a reason people posted these, and if at least a couple are true, it paints a decent picture of the environment. also, while I\u2019m not a student of color, the submissions seemed pretty reasonable as something I would see happen at Mines, as I have a lot of experience hanging out with minorities here. and I am a gay woman, so a minority in another sense.\n\nedit: phrasing of a sentence",

The people here are pretty chill.  \n\nAs some others have said, it's more conservative than a lot of colleges, but mostly on the fiscal side. I've hardly encountered anyone that was super socially conservative, and literally only one person that made themselves a problem on that front.\n\nIt's also a distinctly queerer school than some people on here seem to think. It just doesn't really have a big \"I'm queer and everyone knows it within five minutes\" population, so you wouldn't know by looking at it. I think my straight friends are the minority of my social circle at this point, and it's not something I seek out (none of them are from oSTEM meetings, etc).\n\nMines is a school where people that are politically active beyond \"I vote once a year\" are fairly rare.\n\nOverall, whatever your demographic is, it's not gonna be a problem for you.",

I don't think you'd have any issues fitting in like politically no matter where you lean. I really haven't encountered any batshit crazy conservatives or liberals.\n\nA lot of dudes obviously as mentioned.

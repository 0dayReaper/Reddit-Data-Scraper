This is inconsistent with the requirements of the publicly approved JeffCo Central Plains Community Plan which calls for the top and slopes of South Table Mountain to remain as open space. If you care about some of the few remaining open spaces, please call into the public hearing to voice your opinion and please send an email to the case manager opposing this proposal. \n\nWednesday, April 6th at 9 AM\n\nCase # 21-132287VC\n\nsturnbac@jeffco.us \n\n[Public Hearing Link](https://www.jeffco.us/Calendar.aspx?EID=8801&amp;month=4&amp;year=2022&amp;day=6&amp;calType=0)",

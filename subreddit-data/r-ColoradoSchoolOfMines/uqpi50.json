But ever since I started looking at the advice and discussion on this subreddit, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll regret my decision to come here.\n\nSeriously, every thread I look at shows at least one person saying all they do is homework and that they barely have time for anything else. It\u2019s extremely discouraging and it makes me really intimidated.\n\nWhat I\u2019m asking is if this stuff is true for the majority of people. I don\u2019t plan on having a high credit count (15 or below for freshman year), but it sounds like I\u2019ll still have no time.",

This is a place where people can vent with likeminded people.  Even my semesters where I had 18.5 credit hours, I still had time to do the things that I love, and work on top of that. You have to learn how to budget and make time more efficient to maximize said free time. Don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s college, have fun, grow as a person, and make money",

And if whenever you're not working you're just guilting yourself about how you should be, that's not really a break. You're not actually recovering, you're just stressing about working instead of working. You need that dedicated time to get out and do something, guilt free. And taking that few-hour break to go and do something fun with a club or friends or something will enable you to get way more done in the work time.",

One thing I should have mentioned in my main comment that you reminded me of is that here, the Spring semester workload goes up A LOT the week before, *during*, and after spring break. Yes, I've typically gotten more HW than usual to work on over Spring break. And the weeks before and after usually have midterms. So don't make the mistake of taking your foot off the gas heading into Spring break while you're here. That's really when you'll have lean into it the most, and you can wreck your GPA by not taking it seriously.",

            "comment": "Engineering's tough everywhere. I've studied at a couple other universities during out of state internships, and the workload and course contents seem very very comparable across institutions. It's just, if you go to UW Seattle's or UCLA's or CU Boulder's subs, most of the posts are not going to be from engineering students, so those subs don't really show the suffering, haha. Mines is almost entirely engineering students, and further...everyone I've asked has said they're on reddit. So you're getting a *very* concentrated dose of engineering student despair here, but I don't think the situation is too different at any other school you'd want to attend.\n\nI also think the lore of Mines can fuck with people's heads before they start and while they're here. I was in the military before college, and I noticed that units that had an air of eliteness about them (or wanted to) would play up a lot of normal, mundane difficulties as being more profound than they were. It seems like if people are primed to expect a lot of unique hardship going into something, they're likely to see every hardship as being more torturous than it is or needs to be.\n\nThe one thing I'll say about Mines is that, compared to other schools, grade inflation is not so much a thing. My buddy at CU Boulder gets curves on every exam in every class, and some are massive -he recently got like a 30 point curve on a midterm. At one school I went to, your lowest 6 out of 12 HWs got dropped, lowest exam got dropped, and there were curves on each exam plus rounding to the nearest high point when calculating final grades. You really can't count on that stuff at Mines. *Some* classes will do *some* of those things, but for the most part, what you get is what you get, here.\n\nSo yeah, don't psych yourself out. You would struggle about as much studying engineering at any other school you'd want to attend. Just manage your time, go to office hours (seriously), try to have a life outside of class, and you should be golden.",

Hardest major on campus, but you get to brag about your pain to everyone.\n\nDon't feel intimidated. The very act of surviving Mines is an achievement. While there are people who just understand everything, get amazing GPAs, and also go party.... they're mostly the outliers and privately have struggles as well. \n\nIt's ok to feel discouraged. The only thing keeping me from giving up at Mines was the shame of being called a \"dropout\" by my family. I made it out, and so have many others. However, don't feel discouraged by having to do a ton of hw. You just have to suck it up and do the hw. I kept gaming at Mines, but I enmeshed it with doing hw (do HW, game for a bit, do more hw, etc). \n\nYou probably won't have much time, but that's not a bad thing.",

I always prioritized sleep ahead of cramming for an exam, because when you cram, you\u2019ll just be tired and forget everything for an exam, but if you sleep, you\u2019re more likely to remember stuff from class.

Obviously I might transfer some credits to cut down on time but I\u2019m kind of still deciding on my major",

I don\u2019t plan on having a high credit count (15 or below for freshman year), but it sounds like I\u2019ll still have no time.\n\nNot that I've ever seen in person.  Most people who are thriving don't bother talking about it on the Internet.\n\nEveryone I knew as an undergrad at Mines had hobbies, a social life, and decent physical health.  (Though \"people I knew\" introduces its own selection bias, since people who do nothing but homework don't socialize.)\n\nThe end-of-semester crunch is usually brutal, but other than that month or so each semester it's completely manageable with good work and time management habits.",

There\u2019s plenty of fun to be had if you look for it. \nYeah it\u2019s hard work sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t have to be your whole life. A lot of people at this school just stress themselves out for no reason\n\nMines is really fun if you want it to be. Also if you have any social skill whatsoever you\u2019ll be leagues ahead of many of your peers.",

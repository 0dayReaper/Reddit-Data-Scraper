    "postText": "With freezing temps and slick ice everywhere, most mornings I\u2019ve decided to just take the L and drive to campus for my 8ams. With some strategy and speculation I can usually avoid a ticket 3/5 days per week, but occasionally costs will get high if parking is on their A game. \n\nBut I was thinking what if we can get a carpool of 4-8 people every morning from digger/infinity to ford or ctlm. Tickets are never more than $30 so absolute worse case would be ~$20 per person per week. And we could switch it up- different vehicles, different lots, different spots. By avoiding 1/3 of the tickets, it could get down to $5/person/week. Plus the drive back up would be kinda nice if its dark and snowing\n\nObviously timing might be an issue, but on MWF I have to leave by 7:30 and T/Th by 10:40 so maybe this works for a few others? I\u2019m driving most days anyways so I could take a few people to start and we could go from there?...",

She's not a very good presenter, though, and she assigns a truckload of readings. Also, her exams are 100 multiple choice questions in 50 minutes, so do with that as you will.\n\nOne of my suitemates had Archer and said he was very chill. I've heard from the Discord that Horan is bad and should be avoided. Other than that, I'm not sure.",

I also had someone tell me that Horan gave the easiest A he's ever gotten. I can't verify if that's true or not since he still hasn't finished grading my first paper.",

He's an easy grader as well, hard recommend.",

    "postText": "Apparently, I'm registered for a 262 class that's supposed to start halfway through the semester that moves at twice the pace, is completely online, and is self-guided. I have the option to switch to face-to-face if need be. However, the online version is really appealing to me since I didn't struggle through 261 or 101 and I have a much better time teaching myself. Has anyone done this before who can speak for it, or is this completely new?",

The research primarily concerns flow assurance engineering, but more info can be found in the links below.\n\n[http://hydrates.mines.edu/CHR/Home.html](http://hydrates.mines.edu/CHR/Home.html)\n\n[https://www.mines.edu/hydrates/research/](https://www.mines.edu/hydrates/research/)\n\nAn ideal candidate would have finished Material and Energy Balances (preferred but not required) and would be able to stay for 2-6 semesters.\n\nIf you (or someone you know) are interested send me a chat/message on here (or comment if it doesn't work), then we can converse through email or text to talk more.",

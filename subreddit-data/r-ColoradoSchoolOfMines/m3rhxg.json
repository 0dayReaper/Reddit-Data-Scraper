The profs I\u2019ve spoken to by going onto campus have said there\u2019s limited space to work due to restrictions, and that their undergrad research space is full. I\u2019ve cold emailed many (10+) profs who have their projects posted and haven\u2019t gotten any responses. Idk what your friends are doing but I can\u2019t find anyone who\u2019s hiring undergrads for research.",

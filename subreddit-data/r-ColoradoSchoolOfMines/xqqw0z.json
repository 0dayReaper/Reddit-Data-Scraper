    "postText": "I took the initiative after reading [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ColoradoSchoolOfMines/comments/x3rcp0/hungry_orediggers_need_to_change_platforms/) to create a Discord server to (perhaps) phase out the overcrowded and outdated GroupMe! If you're interested in joining, it's on the Mines student hub or you can join with [this invite](https://discord.gg/uXVqwHCn8q)!!!\n\nHere's some cool features this server has that the GroupMe could never:\n\n1. You can chat in addition to food pings!! You won't get banned for expressing gratitude like poor Sofia the other day who said \"God bless. Mines breakfast this morning was so bad.\"\n2. You can post your favorite recipes and gourmet dishes in Chef's Corner! We're all Hungry Orediggers, meaning some of us can cook to satisfy ourselves.\n\nHave fun food hunting! u/Ore-igger I hope this satisfies you.",

            "comment": "The problem with the groupme is people posting non-free food post of any kind.  This discord creates more of the flurry of notification problem imo.  Yes, users can mute channels but if anyone can post in \"food pings\" and that's the primary \"free food channel\" it can be abused by trolls like the group me.\n\n\n\n\nThere's 1100 people on the groupme, people posting anything that isn't free food is a nuance to everyone there, many of which rely on services like blaster's basket and hungry orediggers.  YOU might be okay with people posting their gratitude or jokes, but it's a nuance and gives someone who skipped the last 2 meals false hope.\n\nEdit: it should only be Food pings all the other channels should be a different community I hate seeing notification dots on discord, that would make it better.  People want free food not a social sceen",

If you're in the Discord server right now, you can see that people are talking in all sorts of channels and no one is getting notified unless pinged. Someone spamming pings? Permanently remove them. In GroupMe, people could rejoin because they weren't permanently banned. There could also be a role given to only trustworthy food announcers that gives them permission to ping everyone.",

My whole thing with using Discord is that it's simply what I view as a better platform for organizing chats like these, whereas the food ping channel has slow mode and any trolls are banned permanently rather than removed from the chat. Plus, the timeouts for anyone that harasses users or beats a dead horse (as opposed to a full on ban) create a stack of better integrated moderation tools.\n\nI completely do get why people prefer GroupMe and more concise chats overall, obviously I'm not one of those people but I also don't see why you're being downvoted for raising valid criticism on this manner (but that's just the Mines subreddit, I guess).",

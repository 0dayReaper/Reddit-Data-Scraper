    "postText": "I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of posts about students being unable to find internships and I figured I\u2019d share some valuable information.\n\nNo matter your major, full professors are expected to teach and perform research. They seldom do this research by themselves and instead enlist the help of grads and undergrads. Go to the faculty page for your major, and see what research is going on and reach to some professors to see if you can work in their lab. Doing research is just as valuable as working in the industry, what matters is you are applying what you know which is what companies care about. Professors are essentially expected to take on and mentor undergrads and grads alike, they can\u2019t get tenure without doing so. So chances are they will likely find a way for you to help in their lab.\n\nMoreover, you can do research for tech elective credits (I did undergrad research to cover 12 of my tech electives) and you can also get paid either by the professor themselves or through MURF. I got paid through a grant for summer research and got credits for regular semester research.\n\nYeah, interning with a company is awesome, but undergrad research is a fantastic way to strengthen your resume and make you a more competitive candidate. Don\u2019t just lay down and die.",

Got 2 job offers at Spring career fair my senior year.\n\nA few years out of school, getting involved in the hiring process at my companies, I can confidently say that working at a grocery store or a burger joint for a summer is 100% worth including on your resume. Truly, half the difficulty in hiring is finding someone who will reliably show up and do the work. Holding down any job, even non-tech, proves some level of competence there.",

You have the diploma, that should you likely have the baseline technical knowledge and ability to learn. \n\nAny work experience shows you can arrive on time, accomplish something, hopefully have a sense of working safely. These basics can be found anywhere from Walmart to Intel. \n\nAll other things equal, if hire a new grad who went back to the same shitty minimum wage job 3 summers in a row than one who bounced between 3 different companies for internships. At least if you went back to the same place, someone was willing to work with you again. I just rejected a candidate who had really good internship experience because when we checked references none of the 3 different companies this person worked for were willing to hire them back.",

I turned her down because at the time I already had a summer internship lined up, and I mainly just wanted to earn some money and get away from Golden.\n\nIt was only years later when I was in grad school, did I realize what doors I may have shut by focusing purely on industry.  In applying to PhD programs, I was a weaker candidate because I couldn't point to formal research experience.  Once in a program, I found the students who really hit the ground running all had previous research experience.  These same students were then the ones who knew how to make compelling cases to apply for fellowships.\n\nIt took me at least a year to get over the mindset that doing well in grad school was a matter of doing well in class.  While industry experience prepared me to be a good software engineer, I had a lot of gaps in terms of research including knowing the value of literature review, identifying interesting problems, experimental design and publishing.  \n\n\nThis was quite a long time ago.  Nowadays I hear getting into graduate schools has become even more competitive, and it sounds like it is almost a prerequisite to have undergraduate research on your CV to get into prestigious PhD programs.",

I\u2019m in a chemistry PhD program now, and I am definitely one of those students that hit the ground running because I already knew the basics. Now that I\u2019m no longer in classes and strictly doing research, I can honestly say I\u2019ve learned more in the past few months than I had in any class I took. This is because I\u2019m applying everything I learned to try and solve new problems that a dusty chemistry textbook doesn\u2019t have an answer to. Classes don\u2019t mean anything if you don\u2019t applying what you learned in them. This is why when I TA\u2019d I told all my students day one that the ey need to do UGR, and many of them have come back and thanked me very recently.\n\nThanks for sharing your anecdote!",

I (a PhD student) have included undergrad researchers on my publications and have even led them to first-author their own papers. Having a publication, even as a supporting author, is rare for undergraduates and will definitely help you stick out in a crowded job field.\n\nOne caveat to this is that every research field is different when it comes to publications, even within the same field of study. You could help for several years and only get a mention at the end of a journal paper or you could jump into a fast moving area and get your named tacked onto the end of a conference paper after only a semester or two. If you get involved at a lab, don't be afraid to bring up the topic and ask if ugrads get listed as authors. Showing interest in the publication process could even help open up more opportunities.",

            "comment": "If you have a car, the commute from Lakewood is easy, particularly north western Lakewood or anywhere near 6th avenue. It\u2019s much cheaper than golden would be, I pay 1100 for a 2 bed in a 4-plex but got super lucky. I\u2019d expect at least 1500 for a niceish 1 bed or 2 bed in a non desirable area. Oak station apartments are fairly new and well located but a lot depends on what your budget is, if you want an apartment or house, and how nice of a place you want! Most places allow pets but for an extra charge.",

We rent from Laurel Property Services, highly recommend, check their website for listings.\n\nThere are other houses in our neighborhood and near campus that are rented out but think it's just like one landlord at each one instead of a property management company. You could check Craigslist housing or Mineslist.\n\nOther common apartment complexes are Altitude apartments (pet friendly) and West 8th Apts. Rent is typically cheaper if you live towards Denver (Lakewood/Arvada).",

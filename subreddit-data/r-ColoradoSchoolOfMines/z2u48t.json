    "postText": "I swear there is no reasoning with the CS department. In CS 200 it\u2019s impossible to get help because of the long lines and they also forbid you from asking other students for help. CS 200 is a completely unnecessary weed out course. They don\u2019t even give you leniency when you\u2019re sick either. \n\n\nFuck the CS department",

I've never waited more than 10 minutes during office hours and have always left with my problem solved. During the night or on weekends I've asked Piazza Questions and usually have them answered within 2-3 hours. I really struggled with Set4 but with 3 weeks between deadlines I was able to go into office hours 5-6 times and still finish with time to spare. Even the exams are questions that were explicitly covered in class and on ZyBooks.  I realize computer science clicks for some and not others but I don't think I'm very good at it. My first time coding was in CSCI 101/102 and I've had more than enough help to make it through 200.\n\nEdit: Professor Scholten has been very accommodating with extensions due to Illness but don't know how other professors handle it.",

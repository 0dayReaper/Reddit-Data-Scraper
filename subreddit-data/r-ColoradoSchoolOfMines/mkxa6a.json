    "postText": "I\u2019m currently choosing between CSM and CU Boulder and I\u2019m having trouble deciding between studying an aerospace major at Boulder as opposed to a MechE major and Mines with a minor in aerospace, since I recently read that it will be offered this fall. I feel like I would value the education at Mines more but the aerospace program at Boulder is really good as well from what I can tell, so I was wondering if anyone could provide some insight as to how the programs in Mines are in comparison? Thanks.",

As for the \"party school\" scene, that area has a niche more similar to Mines. That campus is slightly split from main campus. Go to both in person and tour. Get a feel for it.",

I think I\u2019m leaning towards CSM anyway unless I hear anything else that would change my mind but I\u2019m not 100% sure yet as you can see haha",

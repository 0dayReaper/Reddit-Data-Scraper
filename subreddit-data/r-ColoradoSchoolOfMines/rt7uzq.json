I grew and matured pretty substantially as a person, and learned a good deal about leadership and respect. \n\nAs for advice, the most important thing is to be yourself! You don't want to get stuck with a fraternity that you don't vibe with just because you were putting on an act. Be honest and let them know what you are looking for in a frat, and what you want to get out of the experience. Lastly, there may be some awkwardness, but try to just ride it out. It is Mines after all, and most people aren't used to meeting a hundred or so people in a week. Don't forget to have fun! And good luck finding your people!",

Go for the ones you are interested, wost case you don't get an invite. When I was there each house was quite different from each other and I'm sure it's the same now, and rush week is the time where you can get a feel for the houses while they can get a feel for you as well. Think of it like a two way interview. I won't comment on which house is \"best\" or even mention the one I was in because I honestly don't know the culture of my old house right now nor how it would work for you personally.\n\nI definitely recommend it. It helped me immensely in getting through Mines. Awesome group of friends from all the majors and at the very least is a solid resource for your classes. Whether that's looking at old notes and tests or getting help from upper class men. Plenty of opportunities for social events, philanthropy, networking. I don't see any negatives to it really. Of course you should still be involved in your specific major organization/club but greek life is another layer of help and assurance",

As an alum, I found that being a mines student amplified the weirdness of Greek life culture and personalities. When I was there, the frats had a very bad reputation, and deservedly so. Even if I was ambivalent about Greek life culture, I wouldn't touch them because the criminal activity and assholes that were drawn to the frats.\n\n If you need a social life, find a study or join a club or IM team.",

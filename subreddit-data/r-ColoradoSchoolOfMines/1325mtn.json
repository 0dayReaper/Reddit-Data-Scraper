    "postText": "So I know that this is very late seeing as I have to commit to a school by May 1st, but I am having an extremely difficult time deciding and would just like some last minute insight. I am OOS student looking to study computer science and possibly computer engineering. I was accepted to Mines but was admitted to exploratory studies at Boulder. I have some scholarships to each school but the price difference isn\u2019t big enough to swing me either way. I\u2019ve also visited both schools and quite frankly feel that I would be happy at either one. \n\n1. Academics. \nSo I\u2019ve heard that Mines is extremely rigorous but i\u2019ve also heard that some of it can be over exaggerated because the students have a culture of \"who has it worst\". I would expect any engineering program to be challenging but is Mines exceptionally difficult, especially in CS? And does having everyone in the same boat/more caring professors make it any easier, or at least more enjoyable? Also how is Mines in terms of undergrad internships and is it realistic to get one during your freshman summer? \n\nI understand that the IUT process is relatively straight forward but being in exploratory studies at Boulder has me a bit nervous if I were to go there mainly because I wouldn\u2019t be a part of the engineering school for my first year. I know that the curriculum for a first engineering student and exploratory studies student are virtually the same but what are the disadvantages to being in exploratory studies my first year. Would I make like minded friends in engineering? Would I have a well balanced life while grinding to get into the engineering school? Would I be set back in terms of graduation or getting an internship/job? Are there any clubs or maker spaces that would be off limits? I\u2019m just having a tough time seeing the real downsides if you want to be an involved engineering student but aren\u2019t in the school. Also, is Boulder like Mines in the sense that they help students get internships/jobs or is it kind of just every man for himself?\n\n2. Social life\n\nWhen I visited the Mines campus I was a bit thrown off by the lack of energy and people. I knew that it wasn\u2019t going to be anything like Boulder but there were so few people it felt borderline abandoned which i did not expect. Now granted I did go on a freezing cold day only a couple days after spring break ended, but does the campus always feel that lifeless? Something that intrigued me about Mines is the greek life. The frats there seem more genuine and productive than those at other schools. Is that actually case with them? Also how are their parties and/or other parties at Mines? I\u2019m not a party animal but definitely like to go to them and want my school to have some sort of scene.\n\nAs for Boulder I feel like the social scene mostly speaks for itself. \n\n3. Growth \n\nThis may seem weird but I feel like a lot can change in four years of living somewhere, so how are the schools growing? Are they changing or expanding for better or for worse?",

            "comment": "can\u2019t speak to CS since I\u2019m not familiar with the department. But, the career fairs are large and you are exposed to opportunities for internships. \n\n\nI can say campus feels much more alive on weekdays and as the weather gets nicer you\u2019ll see people hammocking, slack lining, studying outside, etc. You may have hit a lull when you visited, as you noted it was a very cold day. You\u2019ll see plenty of people :45-:15 since that includes when most classes get out, as well as the student center, plaza, Kafadar commons, and the rec center are pretty much always occupied. \n\n\nfor Greek life, I will say it feels less intense than larger state schools like Boulder. it\u2019s about 20% of campus, but higher for women. It\u2019s a good way to make friends, get involved, have a leadership position, and the houses are located near/on campus. I\u2019ve also seen that a good chunk of leadership in Peer Mentors, USG, etc. are people involved in FSL (fraternity and sorority life, the school official term for Greek life). Frats generally throw parties once a month or so (excluding holidays like EDays and Halloween), which totals to 1-2 per weekend. Mines is not a school where parties are happening on weekdays, functions are typically Friday or Saturday only. I can\u2019t say much of house parties as those are more you know a person kind of thing. If you\u2019re looking for a party scene, you can find it, but it\u2019s not prevalent. Also, if you\u2019re a guy you generally can only go to your own fraternity\u2019s parties and if you\u2019re invited to another by a friend. If you\u2019re interested in learning more about the fraternities, you can look them up online or Instagram, IFC (inter fraternity council) also has info. \n\nfor growth, Mines seems to be expanding some departments. from what I\u2019ve heard, your first-year cohort should be smaller than previous years, as current first-years and sophomores are the largest classes ever and there have been growing pains (not enough class sections, housing, parking, etc.). So it seems like Mines is growing but approaching a carrying capacity. \n\nOverall, best of luck, this is a difficult decision!! Just know you\u2019ve worked hard and you\u2019ll be successful whichever school you choose.",

            "comment": "Concur with what others have said, the one thing I have heard from buddies that went to Boulder is there is slightly more variety of courses available within the CS department and there is a larger amount of embedded circuits/computer engineering courses at Boulder over Mines. This is changing and as we get more professors in the EE and CS departments more classes and variety may be opened but that may not be known by now.",

            "comment": "General opinion is that mines CS dept. is good, but not incredible. The real speciality of this school is the earth sciences. Now, I haven't taken any computer science classes here or elsewhere so this is based on what I've heard from other people. \n\nAs for social life, once the sun comes out, the campus comes alive. The big green space on campus gets spiderwebbed with slacklines and is full of people hanging out. (Additionally, everyone I know was getting their asses academically kicked post spring break, so that likely contributed to what you experienced.)\n\nI'm not in greek life, but a frat boy pissed in my trash bin freshman year so they're definitely up to something.\n\nAs for growth, there's complaints that the school is letting too many new students in each year, it's making it hard to get into necessary classes. The parking and housing situations are kinda abysmal but supposedly they're working to solve them. But, if you come in with more credits than your peers and manage to find a place to live near campus, these issues are largely alleviated.",

            "comment": "I cannot speak directly to comp sci (I'm doing MechE here) but I have a lot of friends that are comp scis, their workload I would say seems ever so slightly more difficult than average, but this could also be because of the comp sci department making lower level courses harder than they need to be. Granted, I'm only a first-year and my friends are too, so I do not know what the upper level comp sci classes are like, and they still have plenty of time to hang out and do fun stuff. As far as Boulder goes, I did a lot of research before I committed here and have talked to more people since, and the engineering program at Boulder is just as good as at Mines. Some people say it's better, some say it's worse. I think any difference in education comes from the students, not the program. \n\nI also can't speak to Exploratory Studies at Boulder, but I can talk about some of the main differences between the schools. Boulder is a regular, stereotypical college: big parties, everyone seems pretty social, a lot of kids more focused on socializing than school. Mines is pretty unique, it feels quite small. I don't know if I've met a single person here more focused on their social life than school; almost everyone prioritizes homework, even on Friday and Saturday nights. That being said, almost everyone I've met here is super kind and awesome in their own way, and I've met some of my best friends here. Hardly anyone is outgoing though, which is not that big of a problem, it's just that if you want to do something fun, you usually have to be responsible for planning it and gathering people. There is a huge mix of people here too; lots of nerds that are happy to talk about the development of AI at dinner, and plenty of people that join Greek life and are generally more chill. \n\nAs far as the frats go, they do not go nearly as hard as frats at other schools, but they still have a good amount of fun. I've been to one or two frat parties, they were solid parties but not crazy or anything. There are really only two/three big party frats, all the others are very chill and just sort of normal dudes. As far as parties in general go, my experience has been thoroughly ok. During events like fall kickoff, homecoming, and E-days, the parties are amazing, tons of people go and they're a blast. Those are really the only times parties are thrown though; you won't find any parties on a random weekend. There have been lots of times where I've finished my homework on a Friday night and wanted to drink a bit and have some fun, and I cannot find anyone else that wants to do the same. Campus is definitely dead at night, however during warm weather you'll find a lot of people playing games on Kafadar Commons during the day. \n\nAgain, I do not know how Boulder is growing, but Mines is definitely putting effort into expanding. They are building a new parking garage, likely new dorms, and a building which is rumored to be mostly for makerspaces and workshops. They would clearly like to take more students. I believe there might be more funding going towards clubs and organizations, but I am not sure about that. It is clear though that Mines is working hard to expand.",

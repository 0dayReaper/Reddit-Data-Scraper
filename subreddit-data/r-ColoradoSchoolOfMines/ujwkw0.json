            "comment": "I can't speak too much on Maple, but as for Weaver...\n\nThe Weaver suites consist of: two bathrooms, 5 rooms (3 doubles, two singles), and a small common/living room with a table, couch and armchair. There are 4 suites per floor of Weaver (minus the 5th floor), so roughly 32 people per floor.\n\nThere is a study room on the ground floor of each side of Weaver, but no \"single person\" study room, so to speak.\n\nWeaver is a 50/50. You could end up living with people you really like and stay friends with for your entire time at Mines.... Or it could be the exact opposite. My experience was the former, but I have talked to plenty of people that experienced the latter.",

            "comment": "Maple has one study hall per side (so 2 per floor) and one social lounge per floor. The suites are 2 double dorm rooms (so 4 people) sharing a bathroom in-between the rooms. There is a Maple Hall tour video on Mines YouTube so you can find it. There are also single rooms available where you share a bathroom with another single but your rooms have doors on them from that area. The study rooms are open to everyone on the floor so study in your room if you need absolute quiet. I had a bit social group on my floor so it really depends on everyone else in Maple that year. I really liked living and Maple and recommend it. Laundry is free and has some amenities. Not perfect but it's fine for college.",

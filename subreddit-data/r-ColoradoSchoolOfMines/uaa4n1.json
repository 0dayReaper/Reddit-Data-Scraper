I will say I was in the same boat as you when I entered Mines, but the humanities professors I\u2019ve had have all been stellar.\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t actually answer your question. The humanities requirement for all majors is HASS100, HASS200, two 300-level, and one 400-level. Which makes 15 hours of non-STEM work, unless you\u2019re also counting economics, which makes 18. If you\u2019re entering in the Fall, you\u2019ll also have to take a 1 credit hour freshman seminar",

So if you\u2019re looking to transfer credits from an institution in the US from things like summer classes, there are some details [near the end of this page](https://www.mines.edu/registrar/tcaprocess/) about getting transfer credits approved. It\u2019s just a form you send to the registrar and your academic advisor. I\u2019m not super familiar with the international transfer credit process, but more info about it can be found [here](https://www.mines.edu/registrar/intl-transfer/).",

            "comment": "Yeah, you're in luck; Mines has one of the lowest humanities credit requirements of any university I've seen. As the other posters said, taking the classes at a nearby community college is an easy way to knock them out. Make sure you check ratemyprofessor to see which professors are going to be the most chill. \n\nBut a word of unsolicited advice from an older student: try to avoid becoming a STEM lord; it will only limit your early-career options. There are a lot of social factors that play into the real world of professional engineering which are unavoidable but difficult to anticipate when you're just starting out. Like, convincing an engineer they're wrong can be impossible if *all* you do is show them that their math is off, or that they made the wrong assumptions, or what have you. It shouldn't be that way, logically, but the reality is that engineers are stubborn monkeys just like the rest of us, so a good systematic knowledge of how to make convincing arguments is probably one of the most important skills you could acquire in your career. Also be aware of in-group biases when it comes to hiring; most hiring managers will have a bias for hiring people like them. You can often (not always) sort of tell when someone has neglected their non-STEM development just by interacting with them (i.e during a phone screen). This is relevant because, despite the stereotypes, most engineers have a pretty normal demeanor and variety of interests, so someone who does not come off similarly will likely experience a bit of bias against them during the hiring process. Again, that's not how an objective, logical hiring process should work, but that's the reality of working with monkeys.\n\nSo anyway, to wrap up this weird rant, try to pick humanities classes you're interested in, take them seriously, and try to figure out how practioners of those fields compose their own work. Then incorporate those learnings into your own life ----&gt; come across as a well-rounded person ----&gt; have more success getting internships and navigating your career.",

I've spent more time talking about my music tech minor than my physics major in most interviews.",

My HS prepared me well for that, and had it not I would not be as good of an engineer as I am today.",

    "postText": "I am a grad student joining CSM this spring. I am looking to get an apartment or something in Lakewood, denver, arvada area because golden is just way too expensive. But other areas are still pretty expensive:( \n\nSo I'm looking into getting a roommate, but since I do not know anyone in colorado, it's low-key, not possible. I'm curious if there are websites mines students use to find roommates or something.",

I would second that Mineslist is your best bet, and you should also keep an eye out for info from your department. Sometimes they try to play roommate matchmaker for incoming students.",

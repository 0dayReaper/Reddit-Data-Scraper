So you don't have to worry while you're in class, but you might have to fight to get to your next one!\n\nQ: What weapons are allowed? \n\nA: Nerf weapons and foam swords are the main weaponry of the game! Target has cheap nerf blasters and Amazon has cheap dart refills!\n\nQ: I saw this post [any day after Monday but before Saturday], is it too late to join?\n\nA: Nope! As long as the game is still going, ***It's never too late to join!***",

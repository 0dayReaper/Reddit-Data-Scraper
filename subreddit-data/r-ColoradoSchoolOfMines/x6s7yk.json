Also, you're right that your first goal as a freshman should be getting comfortable talking to employers. It's pretty unusual for freshmen to get an internship, but mining engineering students have a better chance than any other major.",

The #1 most helpful thing to getting a good job when I graduated, were the internships I had each summer. \n\nSo for now it's ok to just dress up and walk around and talk to recruiters and ask about summer internships. If they don't have any yet (too early for summer), it's just good practice. Then at the spring career fair you'll be ready to actually interview and all that.",

Not everyone gets one, but it\u2019s not an impossible feat. Find something in mining that will set you apart- your personal connection to mining, a mine you\u2019re interested in, or a problem in mining you want to learn more about. Find a way to show recruiters your ambitious, motivated, and passionate. Internships are a way for companies to cultivate talent. They, in no way, expect you to know the answers. But they\u2019re looking for someone who they can easily mold into a good employee when the time comes. \n\nThere\u2019s definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to talking to recruiters. I would suggest not going to your first choice, or even a mining company, to get your legs under you and understand how the conversations go.",

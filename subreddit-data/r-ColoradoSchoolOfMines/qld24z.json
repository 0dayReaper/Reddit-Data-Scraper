The themed units are things like musicals and westerns. The actual work for the class is discussion of the films and a few papers. It is supposed to be very easy, but it is also very selective.\n\nEdit: it is HASS416",

She'll give you a list of questions that will be asked about the movies. And there will be times she'll reference a specific part of the movie as well.\n\nSo I would say at least answer all the reading questions and movie questions that are provided. From experience, it can be difficult to follow along with class if you didn't watch/read the assignment. \n\nShe does give you the list of every movie she's going to have you watch so you can always just watch the movies beforehand.\n\nHonestly, the teacher for that class is amazing and super understanding. As long as you show that you're trying your best and keep her updated if something goes downhill, you'll be perfectly fine.",

            "comment": "I graduated this last May as a ChemE. If you need a technical elective anything with Jechura is incredibly easy and rewarding (Petro Processes, Energy, etc.) Brewing is also VERY fun and I highly recommend it, but it is a LITTLE more work than Jechura\u2019s electives. If you want an Easy A then Jechura is the way to go. Stay away from Barankin\u2019s electives at all costs.\n\nFor a 400 HASS I have to say that Film studies was probably the easiest class I took at Mines. Anything with Shannon Mancus (I think that was her name) is an easy and pretty fun class.\n\nFinally, if you need any free elective the most valuable and interesting class (and probably most applicable to my career so far) I took at Mines is Engineering Economics with Andrew Pederson. It is an EXCELLENTLY designed course and the only class I recommend to anyone I talk to at Mines.",

This class is the easiest HASS I have taken at Mines. \n\nAlso kind of the best class ever if you're into talking existence, finding purpose in life, meditation, spiritual practices of the world etc.. Roel is legit THE MAN. \n\nThursday Nights 6-9pm once a week. Not sure the course number. Sometimes its listed as a HASS special topic. \n\nThis class is dope!!!!!",

Taking it currently and it\u2019s not too bad, we have weekly or every other week reading questions to answer but they\u2019re really easy compared to other hass I\u2019ve taken. 2 papers per semester but he grades super easy, I got 100/100 on my first paper after writing it at 3am the night before, all that matters is word count. It fills up extremely fast but if you can get on the waitlist you are guaranteed to get a spot. Cullison is a great guy, I actually enjoy his lectures.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, I am a rising sophmore in Computational and Applied Mathematics and trying to figure out if I can graduate early from Mines, but I\u2019d have to take 18 credits per semester up until I graduate. Is this a sure fire way to drive myself into the ground? I could possibly graduate a semester early with less credits per semester, but I don\u2019t want to have to take out more loans. Any advice?",

Summer classes allow you to have some breathing room, but they aren\u2019t covered by financial aid.\n\nI also discovered that graduating early isn\u2019t as big a deal/beneficial as people think lol",

Unless you\u2019re one of those wunderkinds where engineering is your god given star crossed ultimate destiny of fate, you will almost certainly develop intense and damage burn out. \n\nThe unfortunate situation is you\u2019re staring down the barrel of the predatory American education system. Wanting to graduate in a way to reduce loans is super super valid. But just know that there\u2019s a reasonable chance it\u2019ll destroy you mentally and physically. And I say this as someone who just graduated and really liked their time at mines. \n\nI know its shitty and privileged of me to say this but I can\u2019t in good conscience recommend you do 6 (?) consecutive semester of 18+ credit hours. It\u2019s simply not healthy",

Furthermore, I feel like I learned FAR less than my peers who had the ability to actually learn in their classes. I was taking classes for the grade, and not for the material -&gt; something I highly advise against. If it is the only option then it is doable, but I cannot stress enough that the burnout and strain are not worth the money saved.",

The loans will suck, but it's gonna suck a lot less than the mental toll those extra courses are gonna take. If you do want to load a bit, talk to upperclassmen and figure out which courses are the brutal ones and take the lighter loads on those semesters and possibly look into a part time internship or something similar for that light last semester.",

Aside from repeating the general advice that the burnout is not worth it (esp while finding a job), consider changing one of your majors into a minor. If you've only finished your first year, downgrading to a minor would probably put you on track for a much lighter 3 semesters while still saving money.  imo Math and CS are too overlapped for applied versatility academic or career wise (vs paired with some sort of engineering for example).   \n\n\nAfter my freshman year, I had to choose either finishing in 2 or 2.5 years.

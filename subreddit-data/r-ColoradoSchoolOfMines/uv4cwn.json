    "postText": "Hello!\n\nFor those that have taken Advanced Software Engineering,\n\n1) What were the hours like when working during the summer? Were they flexible and how long were they (e.g. 9-5 pm) ?\n\n2) Is it possible to balance doing advanced software engineering and a software engineering internship simultaneously? I do not know how work-intensive the summer field session is but is it possible to do both?",

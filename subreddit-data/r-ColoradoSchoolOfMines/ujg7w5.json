If you randomly look up top 100 engineering school, if they offer civil degree, I can assure you that you they are not requiring you to take this class(survey, this is not a CAD class, C3D is survey). unless you are a surveyor or work in LD, I don't think a person with a civil degree will ever be using this class again. so, what's the point of requiring this class? (same as foundation, however, we're not talking about that class and I'm using it, so...)  \n\n\n there were definitely a few more, but I don't remember anymore, it was years ago.",

The teaching is really phenomenal and they are more than willing to help if you ask. If your group starts falling behind because of rework, then the hours seem longer and it's not as fun. Just be sure to stay on top of everything and you'll be more than okay!\n\nIt's a fun time; don't stress about it too much. You'll get through it and you'll definitely have a better understanding of Civil Engineering on the other end!",

You'll have the whole day to not worry about exams or other classes, just field session. Make sure you bring sun protection, and some water/snacks, and make friends with your group mates",

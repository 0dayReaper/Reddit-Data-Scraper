My roommate and I (both foreigners) love to play soccer, so as we haven't been able to meet people yet I would like to know if someone here is down to play soccer during the semester. Hit my DM if you are interested.  \n\n\nI wish you all a great year.",

At the very least we will continue doing that for the next couple of weeks, but we'll see if we keep that time and location or not as the fall semester starts.",

Then you can take the W line to Union station and transfer to the A line (I think) and it goes straight to DIA. Govt station is right next to Jefferson County court on Jefferson St. \n\n 2 hrs trip but it is free if you also have the student RTD pass. You can get it printed for free in the Busar office in student center.",

More seats, better ride, better train overall and less walking to transfer trains. Wheat Ridge/Ward station is closest but RTD may want you to pay a few bucks for parking there long term. Olde Town Arvada station is free parking up to 30 days in the parking garage. \nAlternate option I use a lot is to Uber to 40th and Colorado station. Much cheaper than a full trip to the airport and not much more timewise. Not sure I would be comfortable leaving my car there long term though.",

But when I was a student I\u2019d park at the jeffco courthouse light rail stop and take that to union station and then transfer to the train directly out to the Airport. That\u2019s the cheapest way with the student light rail pass for sure",

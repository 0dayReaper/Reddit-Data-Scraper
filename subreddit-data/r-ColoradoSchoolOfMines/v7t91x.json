    "postText": "I\u2019m thinking about getting a cheap car for some stuff this summer and wondering if it would be worth it to bring to school as a freshman? I\u2019d imagine it might help getting to the snow, hikes, stuff like that. But maybe it would be mostly a burden. And where would I park it.\nThoughts?\nThanks",

Idk what you do in your free time but it can be very useful to get to the mountain, climbing walls, target, etc.\nNow you can always find a ride somewhere if you want one but it's super nice to have that ease of access in my opinion.\n\nBut if you don't do any of those things then no you likely won't be using a vehicle all that often",

I was also very active freshman year and wouldn\u2019t have been able to do half the stuff I did without my car. Also for snowboarding, you\u2019ll have no way to get to the resorts unless you make a friend with the same pass who has one\u2026 not a low chance but certainly not guaranteed either",

Plus maintaining a car on a college student budget\u2026 just not a great idea I think.\n\nIt\u2019ll be a good opportunity to make friends with cars that have similar interests imo",

It's fantastic being able to just drive to Boulder, Denver, Arvada, etc. \n\nAn on campus permit is $150 a semester at the cheapest. It's your best bet for parking your car somewhere you don't need it all the time.",

For me personally it was worth the cost + working weekends. Just don't expect to find a parking spot quickly and close to your dorm if you leave in the middle of a school day.\n\nAlso keep in mind being the person with a car in your dorm means you're gonna get asked to chauffeur people a lot",

Mines is mostly on a hill, there are swarms of student pedestrians *eeeeeeeverywhere*, and Golden has a lot of intersections that start at the base of hills which are nearly impossible to get up in the snow/slush. Definitely not a good place to lose traction, plus half the parking is streetside and on a slope.",

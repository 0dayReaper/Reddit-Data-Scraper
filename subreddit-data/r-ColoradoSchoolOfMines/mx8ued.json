    "postText": "I know we all have our favorite online learning platform of Lon-Capa, /s but the physics department has finally decided it's time to move away from the 90s tech used in Phys 1&amp;2. After fear that a Chrome update would break the security certificates on Lon-Capa, they are now moving to WebWork, transferring the curriculum over during the summer.\n\nI know this change will be in place for next fall so it's a bummer that freshman will no longer experience the suffering that is working with Lon-Capa's buggy numerical and Algebraic systems, (let alone it's waning compatibility with modern browsers).\n\nI know a lot of Alumni and current students will know the frustrations of Lon-Capa but it's nice to see them updating to something from this century.\n\nAny condolences for death of Lon-Capa and the green box?",

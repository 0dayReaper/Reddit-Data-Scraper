    "postText": "I\u2019m a freshman, just moved here from Georgia, without saying too much about my student loans, my dad\u2018s credit tanked right before co-signing my loan because he lost his job during the pandemic and tried to start a business instead of getting another one (I\u2019m not blaming him for this because it\u2019s his job, his life, his money, he can do whatever he wants, but my interest rate is insane)\n\nI\u2019ve done some math, I\u2019m a computer science major, and even with salary growth and paying as much as I can during college and the maximum amount to still be able to eat and live after college, it will take me 38+ years to pay them off.\n\nIs it worth it? Should I just transfer back to in-state?\n\nEdit: so it turns out I\u2019m a dummy with math (I know, compsci major who\u2019s bad at math), I calculated this awhile ago and didn\u2019t bother recalculating before posting, which I should\u2019ve, and I think (not positive) the mistake I made was calculating how much I\u2019d spend a year as how much I\u2019m spending a month, which would become 38 months instead of years paying the absolute maximum, so by choosing a more comfortable monthly payment, a five year plan seems a bit more reasonable.\n\nStill, based on some responses, I\u2019m going to talk to my parents about it. They both moved to Florida a month before I came to college, but my technical new residence is a family friend\u2019s house in Georgia, I\u2019ll do some research on the legal aspects of where in-state would apply because of this, but as of now I\u2019m completely undecided. Colorado has always been my dream state to live, and I don\u2019t think I could survive three more muggy Georgia summers tbh (94% humidity the other day). I love the community here, both state wise and school wise, and I think that might just be worth it, but I\u2019ll see.",

On the other hand Mine's isn't really *that* special. There are plenty of extremely successful computer scientists from any school, so I don't think you'd be throwing your life away or whatever by returning to Georgia or somewhere else more affordable for you.   \n\n\nAs others have said I would try to look into other financial aid or loan options, because frankly 38+ years does not make sense for a mid-high income degree like com-sci. Mostly the only people I know taking that long to pay off loans are, like, k-12 teachers. \n\nWhatever you do just trust yourself because it'll probably work out. There are many paths to a happy and successful life and I'm fairly confident that you can find those paths at Mines or with transferring.",

Getting a job definitely isn\u2019t guaranteed and not every company pays the same, but as someone in industry\u2026 I\u2019d be very surprised to find that to be the case. My fianc\u00e9 has nearly 100k in loans at a rough rate and even without my salary their repayment wouldn\u2019t take close to that long.",

If you were in mining, petroleum, or possibly metallurgy/materials then maybe CSM would still be worth it... but the cost of out of state tuition is so high I just don't see the benefit for the other majors that can be found at a good in-state school as well.\n\nAnd I'm not saying you should change majors, I think CS is probably the most versatile and useful thing you can go after right now (kind of wish I went that route).  It's just not something CSM is known for",

If you can keep a high GPA then you will be looked at all the time by companies (Pretty sad most in Colorado look at a GPA over experience and projects). If your college in state is accredited then it is worth going back to save the funds and stress of Mines.   \nFor myself since I lacked the 3.0 GPA and internships I am stuck with a talent agency job making 56K a year for the first 6 months. The Mines degree doesn't really mean much to companies if the GPA isn't there.   \nA lot of my Comp sci friends have good jobs due to having family give them references.   \nAs long as you get experience from internships or projects, improve your skills and do your best, a degree anywhere can top Mines.   \n\n\nBest advice I can give is do personal projects and often and add them to a resume.",

Not compsci but I can offer this advice:  if you stayed in state or went to another SEC school what would your job prospects look like if you had a degree from say UGA or Tech versus if you had one from Mines?  If you are extremely concerned with the debt you\u2019re going to rack up, consider going back to the south even with the muggy summers.  I can give a bit of insight on Auburn, two of my friends there did computer engineering and now are doing great in their respective careers.  I can\u2019t speak much for mines CS program since that\u2019s not why I went to mines, but I know people did make the most out of the degree.  Hopefully you find the best path forward for yourself! :)",

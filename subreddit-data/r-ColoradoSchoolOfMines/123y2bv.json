    "postText": "Hi everyone. So I\u2019m currently a NYC based HS senior and atm it\u2019s looking like I will be going to Mines. I got in EA here along with WPI and RIT and have been rejected almost everywhere else lol. Before I commit though, I have some doubts/worries that I was hoping you all could help me with.\n\n1: The dating scene.\n\nSo as a straight guy, I can\u2019t help but notice that nearly 70% of students are men. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m much of a player per se back home, and I don\u2019t exactly want to be single for all of college lol. Can anyone speak to what the dating scene is like for guys like me?\n\n2: Low graduation rate in 4 years. \n\nSo I don\u2019t remember the number off of the top of my head, but it seems like only something in the 60% range of students graduate within 4 years. Does anyone know why? Is it something I should be worried about?\n\n3: First year Honors.\n\nSo I\u2019m currently applying to Grandey and Thorson, and of everything I\u2019ve seen on their websites, it seems like a great experience. Unfortunately, everything I\u2019ve seen on this subreddit says the opposite. Should I not even apply?",

Covid, surgery, and other issues really fucked up my plans. Life isn't perfect. I wouldn't expect a 4 year graduation if there's any significant circumstances. \n3. Honors programs don't add anything special. The themed living communities in the dorms are a better investment.",

I made some friends up there and it was fun to go to a party school and experience that from time to time, but I liked being further away from that scene than immersed in it. \n2. I took a senior lap as well. Getting a degree from this place sets you up for life and the institution knows that so it\u2019s hard to get through. Get past the core classes and you\u2019ll be looking good for you major classes. \n3. Can\u2019t speak to this\n\nIf you buckle down and get a degree from this school, it does a great job to set you up for success.",

Note that RIT's numbers are similar. Lots of Mines students just need an extra semester or so. (Also, 67% is pretty good for a public university. CU Boulder's 4-year rate is 53%.)",

As others have noted you can enlarge your search area into Denver, but there are still definitely women at mines. \n2. Mines is hard. It isn\u2019t anything to scoff at, and some people underestimate the work needed. If you work hard and accept that you are going to a difficult school, I am sure that you can get out in 4 years, if that\u2019s something that really matters.\n3. I can\u2019t personally speak to this, but Thorson and Grandey have been good for friends of mine. Getting design 1 and NHV out of the way was good.",

You\u2019ll find that it\u2019s not hard to meet more women, just make an effort to talk to them or join clubs to meet more of them. Many of my guy friends have vented to me about their concerns finding a girlfriend but most of them are now in happy healthy relationships because they just randomly met someone in a class or at a party. And if being in a frat if your kind of thing you could also join that because there are a lot of frat-sorority cross over events.\n\n3. I would absolutely not take Thorson honors again. I took it last year and it was a horrible experience, especially if you\u2019re a MechE because you won\u2019t learn solid works like they do in Design 1. The grading scale is basically made up and all super subjective so if you don\u2019t fit their exact image of a student you won\u2019t do as well as those who do. There is little to no oversight for the program which means the professors basically can do whatever they want and it\u2019s very difficult to get admin help to change the course.",

Greek life + meeting people in classes will boost this.\n\nI don\u2019t know about grandey but I was involved in Thorson and it was an overall net positive for students who \n\n1) don\u2019t mind reading/writing and simple assignments that involve drawing/art/discussion\n2) aren\u2019t mech-E\u2019s (who will benefit more from solid works curriculum that you get in design 1, which Thorson replaces) \n\nTaking Thorson replaces design 1 and Nature and Human values, which (depending on your professor) can be major headaches for a lot of people. It\u2019s also a nicer environment for group projects bc people who joined it and got in are more motivated and easier to work with then the randoms you might get stuck with in Design1/NHV - this also leads to meeting cool people and making friends.\n\nIf you want to learn solidworks at a decent level and/or you really don\u2019t like reflection/reading/writing/discussion/drawing, then Thorson is probably not for you. Feel free to dm any other questions",

A few are stuck up and think they're hot shit, most are very down to earth and easy to talk to. Dating apps also exist. The Denver metro is a big area with lots of college aged people. You'll be fine if you put in the effort. \n\n&gt;2: Low graduation rate in 4 years. \n&gt;\n&gt;So I don\u2019t remember the number off of the top of my head, but it seems like only something in the 60% range of students graduate within 4 years.

But i also came in with a decent amount of credits and took summer classes. Not impossible to graduate in 4. Again, you'll do fine if you put in the effort.",

            "comment": "1. There are a lot of dudes with *no* social skills that you can effectively \"remove from the competition\". My biggest protip is to never bitch about \"the ratio\", as that is a pretty instant turnoff to most women. Make friends with girls without the ulterior motive of them all being \"prospective girlfriends\" and not trying to be the first person on your floor to get laid. I'm not exactly a ladies' man, but I *did* meet my wife at mines so I did something right. Also, there's the whole city of Denver outside of mines. Thousands of single people out there looking to date.\n2. The US average 4-year graduation rate is 33%. 6-year rate is 63%. That's based on total incoming students rather than graduating students so it's probably a different stat than what you're talking about. But it's actually quite common nationwide to take more than 4 years. It's absolutely doable, but you don't wanna get caught slacking because one missed class can set you back a whole semester, some even by a year.\n3. Honors programs are great if you end up in a job interview conducted by someone that *also* went through that honors program. But with how selective they are, that's pretty rare. So it becomes a question of \"does the material in this program actually interest me?\" If so, awesome. If not, don't go arbitrarily prestige-seeking.",

Colorado dating is, to start off, not great anyways but I wouldn\u2019t say the dating game here is necessarily bad. Since you seem nice and aren\u2019t currently a player, you shouldn\u2019t have a very difficult time dating. But you definitely don\u2019t have a very wide or deep pool to pick from. My current partner I met outside of campus, but before meeting him I thought there were many options for dating at Mines. The dating scene isn\u2019t the biggest b/c everyone is so busy.\n\n2. The graduation rate is so low (in 4 years) because of the high credit requirement and many, many, students had to re-take courses which are only offered once a year. Recently the school decreased the number of required credit hours by 10, so this shouldn\u2019t be as much of an issue. However, retaking a course because the grade isn\u2019t high enough for your major is a possibility to be aware of, as it can significantly set you back in graduation time. I know multiple people from my freshman year who will be graduating late because of this. However, summer classes and online classes are options that can help avoid this &amp; allow you to graduate in 4 years (sometimes less!). I personally had to take summer classes and multiple semesters of high course-loads to graduate in 4 years.\n\n3. Unfortunately, I cannot comment on first-year honors as I did not participate. I have heard the same as you though from my peers - it was a mixed bag of whether they thought it was worth it. Not sure what it does for you overall, though beyond a community to live in first year.\n\nWhether or not you should apply is up to you - do you want to live in CO? What kind of college experience are you looking for? Hope this helps!",

If you learn your material well, you can do it on a standard 4-year schedule, be aware that many of the the upper-level courses are only offered once a year, so if you get off schedule, that's another year maybe added to catch that required course.

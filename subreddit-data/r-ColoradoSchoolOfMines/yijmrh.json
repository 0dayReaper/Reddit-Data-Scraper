Not sure who the prof is and if this is in jest. \n\nBased on my experiences, any time the prof feels the need to chew out an entire class because they did so poorly on the test\u2026 it\u2019s the profs fault not the students. \n\nThis is said with age, experience and humility too.\n\nIf it\u2019s a joke great. If it\u2019s not, these kinds of professors are some of the worst.",

Covid hit and he was too lazy to teach the class over zoom so instead he just posted his slides to canvas along with an mp3 file of him talking over them.",

I have tried looking around on Google and couldn't find anything. The local news should do a spotlight story on him because it was quite interesting and funny at the same time.",

He was our hype man for all those years, but he loves Mines football so much he comes back for a lot of the games. He is a great dude and has a lot of passion for Mines.",

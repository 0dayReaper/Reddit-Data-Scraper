    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nIn the fall I'll be an incoming physics PhD student and I've been looking at housing options in the Golden/Denver area. The purpose of this post is just to ask: does anyone have any recommendations on decent places to live? I'm realizing the housing market around Mines is pretty expensive, and it looks like a 1br apartment is going to be about double what I'm paying now. \n\nTrying to see if I can avoid having roommates, at least for my first year, and if anyone has any recommendations for apartments that would be great. I'm hoping to find something decent in the $1300-$1400/month range (before really looking I was naively hoping for something around $1000/month but I was quickly disillusioned). I'm pretty flexible about location so long as its not too far from campus. I've also of course been doing my own traditional housing search- I just figured why not ask to see if anyone has suggestions/horror stories.\n\nPlanning to visit in about 2 months to do some tours, so hopefully I can find some options before then.\n\nPS if anyone has any advice for someone moving to golden (from TX) as a grad student, I'm all ears, I just joined the sub!",

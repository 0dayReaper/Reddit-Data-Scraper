I really don't want to lose internship opportunities due to CSCI 370, but I wanted to hear how hellish the fall course is compared to the summer course first.",

It's definitely manageable during a regular semester since it's spread out over like 4 months, but in a summer session you'd be doing the same amount of work in like half the time.\n\nPlus, your concerns about internships are valid. A couple months working a compsci job looks better than a couple months taking a compsci class. I'd say knock out your field session as soon as possible and take Software Engineering during the academic year.",

This means it's easier for you to collaborate with your team and focus on getting the work done. It's also closer to working a regular job/internship with the hours you put in. Bonus points if you have a client who can offer a paid internship at the end of the field session, though this is not always guaranteed. You're doing this over five weeks, but it's really not that frenetic as it's your only focus.\n* In the fall, you're juggling a regular course load over 16 weeks. It's harder to gather as a team outside of the scheduled course hours (of which, you typically only go to one or two in a given sprint). Because the field session is so long, if you're not careful, you can inadvertently stack up a ton of work at the end of the semester \u2014 at the end, you're putting together a final report, final presentation, *and* delivering the project to the client. I wouldn't describe this as hellish, but there's a lot more opportunity for stress and weekend work (I never worked weekends on my summer field session).",

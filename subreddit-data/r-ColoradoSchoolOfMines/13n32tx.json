    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI'm currently a rising senior in electrical engineering from Texas A&amp;M University &amp; Colorado School of Mines is one of the schools I'm looking at for graduate school (Being in college station has been extremely difficult for me with the lack of hiking and outdoorsy things to do). I wondered if anyone on this thread knew of bioelectronics professors to contact for information regarding this research area. \n\nI'm specifically interested in the electrochemistry/materials and experimental side (trying to get away from EE) and currently researching lignocellulose materials for supercapacitors (which is similar to the area I want to). I specifically want to go into renewable energy and using bioelectronics in energy production. \n\nIf anyone has any information, I would appreciate it! Thanks in advance!",

Those folks will have preferred faculty at mines to work with, so identifying NREL projects that want you is the more important part.",

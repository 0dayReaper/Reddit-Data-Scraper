    "postText": "I am a few weeks into Math 335 statistics and I am completely lost. Not only are the homework assignments becoming unbearably difficult but the quizzes feel disconnected from the rest of the class structure and I am bombing them hard. Normally I am a good student, and I didn't feel like Math 334 was all that challenging (I did take it over the summer, however, which may be contributing to my lack of understanding a bit). But I got a pretty easy A in that class. Is anyone else finding this class ridiculously challenging and for anyone who has taken it, what have you done to make it understandable? I have a midterm coming up soon and I don't really know what to do.",

Go to office hours, talk to a TA or the professor. \nI was taking Circuits, and I got to a point I felt I was in waaay over my head and knew I was in real trouble for the final. I sucked up my pride and went to see the prof during office hours. Get some help, it's okay to ask for help in classes, whether from peers or from the professors.",

I've gone to office hours but it's like there's an expectation of mastery for the prior materials. I just need like more example problems but we haven't been given anything at all. We have a discord to help with work but it still feels like most of the answers are formed from equations that have barely been explored.",

Sitting down with the textbook is the best way to work with the material at your own pace.\n\nEdit: wanted to add you can dm me for a copy of the textbook if you need it, it's optional for the class but it's a handy tool",

    "postText": "Hi, so on Ellucian it shows that I have a work study award for $1,500. It also shows estimated hours at 0. Im a little bit confused at how a work study can be 0 hours. I tried emailing the financial aid office but all they said is work studies require work\u2026 I just want to know why it\u2019s showing 0 hours and also if anyone knows if I could start working second semester.",

            "comment": "You might want to try looking in banner. Typically, when you get a work-study award they give a cash amount to be paid to you over the course of the term. It might not list the number of hours because not every work-study job has the same hourly rate. Also, this is all approved through FAFSA and federal funding, so if you don't have the work-study award I think you'll have to wait until next year. Best of luck!",

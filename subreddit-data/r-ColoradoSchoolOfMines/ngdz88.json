Just graduated but was a Phys 2 TA for the past 2 and a half years so I know a thing or two.\n\nYour decision should come from one of the professors (Probably Dr. Kohl) in an email format. I believe it should be happening right about this time, or it may have already happened. I must confess I am not sure if he sends out emails if you are not selected, cannot remember exactly. But it should be here soon if you haven\u2019t received one by now!",

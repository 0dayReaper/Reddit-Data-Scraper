            "comment": "There's usually around 50-60 of us, all classes combined. EDIT: I should clarify that\u2019s just at Mines, the entire detachment usually has a little over 300 people. \n\nCommuting for class isn't bad. Freshman normally only have to commute to Boulder for LLAB as their professor for AS class comes to Mines. Sophomores also generally commute once a week, but their class will be in Boulder right before LLAB. Juniors and seniors normally commute twice a week, since they have class twice a week on top of LLAB. Obviously, there are some exceptions to the rule, and things are pretty subject to change to whatever, especially while we still deal with the covid stuff going on. There's usually a Thursday afternoon LLAB and a Friday morning LLAB, you can sign up for whichever best fits your schedule, but Thursday is by far the more popular option at the moment. Again, these things are always subject to change.\n\nThe schedule is not bad or unmanageable, but keep in mind it is a pretty significant commitment. If PT is in person again in coming semesters, you can expect to be waking up before 6am 2 or 3 times a week. As a freshman and sophomore, you won't have many responsibilities outside of class and LLAB. Upperclassmen will have significantly more, as they are put into jobs where they need to be running and leading different aspects of the Cadet Wing or are in charge of underclassmen. But upperclassman's class also gets registered as 3.5 credit hours instead of 1.5 so it's reflected there a little bit, I suppose. It's not uncommon for people here to extend to 4.5 or 5 year undergrad degree programs to manage the workload. As far as total time commitment goes though, the best answer you can really get is that 'it depends.'\n\nBeing a crosstown has its advantages and disadvantages. You won't have as many opportunities to interact with the detachment at Boulder, obviously, and probably won't be joining any extra-afrotc-curriculars like Arnold Air Society or Honor Guard, but you'll be at Mines and interacting with a bunch of rad people and enjoying fun car rides. In the end, if you make it through everything, you'll commission with the same 2nd LT rank everyone else does. I know you didn't ask for advice, but if I were to give you some, I'd say first - choose what school you want to go based on the school itself, ignoring AFROTC. AFROTC isn't a guarantee commission, and things are starting to get extremely competitive with a decreasing demand for new Air Force officers (50% of the sophomore class nationwide is about to get 'cut,' starting today actually). You don't want to be stuck at a school or too invested in a school that you settled for if AFROTC doesn't work out.\n\nAll in all, AFROTC here is cool, you'll have plenty of opportunities, and if you want to be an Air Force officer, it's a great way to get there and you'll meet a lot of cool people along the way. If you want me to elaborate on anything or I wasn't clear enough on anything, let me know.",

I just want more insight than having to dig on the school website for the gender inclusive housing. I would love to be able to attend mines in the fall, but to some extent this stuff could be a safety concern and I haven't been able to tour yet so I just want to know more. \n\nThanks a lot.",

The Honors undergrad program, McBride, ended up being the only place I felt like I was really in a comfy environment though.\n\nedit: half of a single eye open morning reddit sentence structure",

            "comment": "Personally, I never felt unsafe at mines but I did not love being a queer person there. \n\nWhile there is oSTEM (a queer professional organization, which also serves as social club and advocacy group) I never felt like there was anything resembling a vibrant queer atmosphere. \n\nAdditionally, the school offers very little support to queer people. Just a few examples: SAFEzone trainings were run by unpaid, untrained student volunteers (I believe I heard they are now run by low-paid, untrained student volunteers) rather than any sort of professional diversity coordinator, which literally every other school I've heard of has. The school fought us for years over allowing preferred names in the school websites such as Canvas. We were asking for it my freshman year and it still wasn't done when I graduated. I don't know if it's happened by now or not (again, this something others schools I've worked with have done and had no trouble with). I never had an (openly) queer professor (though I have heard of a few, so it's not completely unheard of). None of the counselors at Mines seemed remotely qualified to handle queer issues. I think you get the idea. \n\nIf you really want to go to Mines I don't think that being queer is a dealbreaker. It's a *safe* place to be queer. There are certainly a fair share of queer people there. But, if having a strong queer community and support is really important to you I might look somewhere else. Or, if Mines is only one of several choices you're interested in, again, might look somewhere else. \n\nI did get a great education from Mines, so I don't want to rant and say that no one should go there. But also I feel so much happier and have made much better friends being in a new environment now that I left, and I would not choose Mines again if I did it all over.",

While I think there's some things Mines could do better to support queer students, (more gender inclusive restrooms and mental health resources for example) I know I at least feel safe on campus. The students I interact with are very supportive and I personally haven't had any negative experiences with faculty. (Heck I even know an awesome professor who goes by they/them)",

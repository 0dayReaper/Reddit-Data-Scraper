            "comment": "Mines park was fun as hell, I lived there sophomore and junior year and had the time of my life. I lived on the far east side right next to 19th, so there was not exactly road access (had to walk the sidewalk) so the police couldn't just drive by and see what we were doing. We drank outside on the lawn, did stupid shit, had small parties, and some studying sure. My upstairs neighbors just studied all the time and never had people over. My friends in the next building over were party boys and we hung out a lot, played beer pong and everything else. And it's soooooo convenient, being uphill and right next to campus, I could ride my bike down the hill and be at any building on campus in 5 minutes.",

The benefit was an excellent location (5 minutes from campus, right next to 19th to go up lookout mountain, and that little forest area as a \"back yard\"), and the social life was great. I made some lifelong friends up there. Parking was easy. We had freedom to do as we pleased.",

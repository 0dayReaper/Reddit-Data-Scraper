[Here's the route info.](https://www.rtd-denver.com/app/route/16/schedule)  The 16 goes along Colfax from Civic Center Station to Golden, and then along South Golden and Jackson/Ford.\n\nYou can *get* to Mines by bus from any RTD stop, since it all connects together; the question is just how long it takes.  A lot of routes will involve switching between the W Line (light rail) and 16 (bus) at Oak Station.",

Or the 16L (fewer stops, same general route).\n\nIf you're going to be riding the bus a lot, it would be a good idea to familiarize yourself with RTD's website, especially the schedules and the [trip planner](https://www.rtd-denver.com/app/plan).",

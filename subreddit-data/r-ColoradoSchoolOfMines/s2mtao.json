I\u2019ve looked through the housing options, but I feel like it\u2019s probably best to talk to the people who\u2019ve actually lived there. Thanks in advance!",

The rooms range from \"trad size\" to \"cubicle with two people in it\" and the problems only get worse from there.",

If you are, go for Maple over Weaver - Weaver is a very old building with tiny rooms. I wouldn\u2019t recommend the trads, but opinions on them vary. They\u2019re known for not having air conditioning, and you don\u2019t need to be friends with your floormates",

Data for academic performance has shown the trads residents have the highest gpa and the lowest drop rate after their first year.\n\nThe rooms are smaller sure, but I honestly wouldn't have wanted to live anywhere else my first year. That belief was further strengthened when I was in charge of building a community in those respective buildings.",

Trads are the most social but have the worst quality forms (small, no AC, etc.)\n\nTLC\u2019s are usually in elm or spruce and it\u2019s basically a floor of people with like minded interests. For mine, the ALC, none of the events are mandatory, so there\u2019s no real commitment, but most people end up going.\n\nBesides that, maple and weaver are pretty in the middle for quality. I think that weaver is one of the least social dorms though.",

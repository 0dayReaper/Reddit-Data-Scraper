    "postText": "I'm a prospective student, and at the moment I'm leaning heavily toward Mines. I've been talking with the Office of Financial Aid regarding a change in income and a reevaluation of my financial aid package. Has anyone had a similar experience that resulted in you getting more aid? And if so, how long did it take? Thanks!",

            "comment": "I did talk to them about a change in financial aid last year and did not get anymore money, but that was also during the beginning of the pandemic. They have a net price calculator online which tells you an estimated based on family income (I was offered around 10k less than what the calculator told me as an out of stater). It took them roughly two weeks to reevaluate my financial aid, but sadly didn\u2019t get more money.\nIdk if you\u2019ll have similar experiences because my experiences were during the pandemic, so other people definitely needed the money more. It definitely shouldn\u2019t be too long to hear an update from them.",

I\u2019ve personally have struggled dealing with the financial aid office a lot so I don\u2019t have the most positive views of the office (ie no responses from chains of emails or charging me for a meal plan that I did not choose). I know many people who have also had similar issues as you with the financial aid office, but did not get offered any more fin aid at all. You never know though. I\u2019d just wait it out and try to stress the situation to them (if they take awhile to respond, keep reaching out frequently)",

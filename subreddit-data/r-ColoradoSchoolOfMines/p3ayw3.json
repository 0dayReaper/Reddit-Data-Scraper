I'm curious as to what the course load looks like and how difficult it is. Also the professor I will have is Paone. \nThanks",

Also there is a digital textbook called Zybooks, but it is easy to complete the activities in it. There are 3 tests I believe, one is a written test, one is code based and the final is a mixture in some way. Feel free to DM me if you want some discord servers or course material. The websites for the CSCI classes stay up so you can go to the current 261 website and see what the course load is looking like right now for the summer semester (expect it to be a bit lighter than the regular semester work)",

Sure, the zybooks can get annoying but the rest of the assignments actually teach you how to write decent code. I easily spent 6-8 hours per homework to program the solutions but the process is totally worth your time and it\u2019s so satisfying once you get there. After finals I even used the stuff I learned in 261 to build my own apps outside of class, no joke. They teach you coding skills you will actually need and use.\n\nIf you\u2019re stuck go to the student-held office hours, they will find that one error that\u2019s driving you crazy. But honestly I did almost everything through trial and error and it wasn\u2019t nearly as hard as people say it is. The biggest downer is the zybooks, but if you keep up with the grind Paone does free homework pass giveaways in class for students with 100% on the zybooks.",

The zyBooks is the worst part in my opinion, but it\u2019s better to stay on top of it and get your credit than it is to fall behind and try to do hours and hours of catch up. Homework assignments are usually pretty self-explanatory, and I didn\u2019t think the exams were too bad. There\u2019s extra credit opportunities and the only very time consuming thing was the final project (I chose to do it independently, would\u2019ve been easier if I did it with a partner). The quizzes can be rough, but that\u2019s why staying on top of everything else is important",

I basically never worried about the class, and then procrastinated and had to pull 4 18 hour days to get all the assignments done that were due on the last day of the semester. So this is one class you can't procrastinate on.",

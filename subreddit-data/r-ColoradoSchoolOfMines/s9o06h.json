If they\u2019re not interested I can\u2019t help you there - but I do recommend taking some other route to help save money - go to red rocks community college for 2 years, save up some money and attend the last 2-3 years at Colorado school of Mines. That\u2019s a much more frugal option, and you\u2019re not missing too much with the Gen Eds.",

After he gets his PE, we will be making the same salary. The big difference is he has zero student loans from his engineering degree while I have plenty of student loans. \n\nI agree that looking into community college or other, more affordable, programs is a great idea. Even if it's for just the first two years, you'll save yourself a lot of money. And places like red rocks have a great transfer program to Mines",

Also, my personal experience was the first year was brutal for lack of aid, but it went up every year. I did have a good GPA from the start that I was able to maintain through all 4 years (even though I got a couple C\u2019s) which helped. My senior year, tuition was covered in full and all I had to pay were the fees (still rough but better than everything).",

From research I know everyone prefers to live at Lakewood, but I'm having a hard time finding duplex's available for rent. Any advice is greatly appreciated, thank you.",

I would say keep your eye out, most places require a 2 month notice if you're going to move out or not, so in June is when you'll start to see a lot of listings of desirable places for Mines Students.",

It's a garden-level in an old house/quadplex and you'll have a super chill, if a little messy, roommate (m35ish) until August. I haven't been living there for about 8 months, so I worked out an agreement not to pay my full half of the rent and don't remember exactly how much it was. I think around $650 to $700. All utilities included in that price, but no washer/dryer unless you make friends with the upstairs roommates. Feel free to send me a dm if that sounds like something you're looking for.",

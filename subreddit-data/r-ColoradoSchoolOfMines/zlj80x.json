    "postText": "I applied to both of these schools but I've been told that they're both competitive for engineering. I know that at Mines you need at least a 3.9 and good test scores to get in. I thought Boulder was easier to get in but my high school counselor said that last year their incoming engineering freshmen average was a 3.92 unweighted and the average SAT math was 710 and reading was 685.  I could get into their exploratory studies program but that doesn't seem like something I want to do.\n\nIf I can't get into either of those schools and go to Colorado State, can I easily transfer?\n\nMy grades so far are good but its a 3.74 unweighted and I had a 29 on the ACT so not sure if either Mines or Boulder engineering will accept my application.

Even if both programs are about the same level skill wise what sets you apart is the weight the school carries in the real world. People who know about these things (mainly scientists and engineers) love mines graduates but the average person knows nothing about mines. This will help you down the road when getting a job.\n\nAlso I agree with doing Gen Eds at a community College if money would be a problem.",

When I applied in 2020 I applied in August right when applications started with a 3.75 weighted and did not submit an SAT. However I did have 6 clubs, sports, volunteer hours, and work experience.\n\nIf you were to not get in then transferring shouldn't be too hard as long as you have a good gpa at your college before transfer.",

I have a friend who has a 4.0 gpa and good sat who didn\u2019t get into Boulder immediately and went through the exploratory studies program, but that worked for him since he got into the engineering program pretty quickly after that",

            "comment": "I cannot attest to Boulder's admittance however what I can say is one of the things that is considered when it comes to your application to Mines outside of your GPA and ACT/SAT is your extracurriculars. If you are taking mostly AP/Honors/IB classes that will certainly help especially if it is Math and Science heavy, as well as if you're in any clubs or volunteer, etc. outside of school. They're when I sat down and talked to admittance about it they said they take the whole picture of a candidate outside of the GPA and scores before making a decision.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnswering your other question I assume you could easily transfer but you would want to knock out as many courses as possible prior to transferring.",

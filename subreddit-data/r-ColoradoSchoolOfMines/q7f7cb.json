    "postText": "I'm a 21y/o guy who's traveling to Golden from Atlanta for the first weekend in November with my mom. She is going to be in a full day seminar sunday and monday, so I will have the city to myself for a couple of days, and I figure fellow college students might know what's fun to do around town.\n\nI'd like to explore the city and national parks if possible. Do you guys have any suggestions for what I could do to get the most out of my trip? I have absolutely no idea what's around there, and I will probably not be able to make it out west again for awhile, so I'd like to do as much as possible. Thanks in advance!",

You could send it to Red Rocks for a show (BTSM is headlining on Sunday, that'd be lit if you're into that type of music). \n\nDenver itself is not that far away so if you're ok to drive a bit there's lots of cool museums to check out downtown. Also the aquarium, meow wolf, there's some cool nightclubs, botanical gardens are awesome altho it'll probably be a bit chilly, lots of cool areas like RiNo, etc",

    "postText": "I'm a stats major and CS minor graduating next Spring. I've kinda dropped the ball on getting internships or doing any research over the past three years. My only work experience is as a TA or part-time at restaurants. \n\nMy question is if this is going to be a significant issue when finding a job? And if it is, can I still remedy it in my senior year?\n\nFor various reasons, I only need to take a minimal number of credit hours my last year, so I'll have a lot of extra time outside of class. Also my gpa is very high. Not sure how much that matters though since I hear that stats is one of the easiest majors at mines.",

This doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be research, but it\u2019s the easiest for people to grasp and relate to. Almost every interview I have had I\u2019ve talked exclusively about my research. Idk what i would\u2019ve done without it.  If you know stats and some R it shouldn\u2019t be that hard to find a job as a data analyst or something along those lines. Very in demand and pays well (gf does it for a living).",

Not having an internship is the one commonality for all resumes that I\u2019ve been passed by someone for feedback or guidance to see if I could help a graduate get a first job. \n\nGPA won\u2019t matter and that goes for every major.  You\u2019ll get filtered by hiring managers or someone along the way looking for a quick way to thin out the stack of applicants because you don\u2019t have internship or career related work.\n\nAs a technical manager I always held one intern position each year just to give to someone that needed it because they had nothing else resume  wise.\n\n\nEdit:\nHere\u2019s one option I found in 10 minutes: https://boards.greenhouse.io/angi/jobs/6729063002?gh_src=61bee8d12us#app\n\nBalls in your court now.  Pick it back up and get it in play.  It\u2019s on your shoulders.  You can do it!\n\nSearch LinkedIn and other sites for some data science intern positions in denver area to see if you can find a couple more.",

Just go to faculty page for your major and click around on Professor bios until you seem something you like. There\u2019s not any specific time frame when you need to ask about research opportunities and a lot of professors are willing to pay undergrads for research over the summer out of their own grants. During the main semester you can either do MURF or do research to cover tech elective credit. But yeah, you don\u2019t even need to wait until this start of next semester to do research.\n\nEdit: if you are gone this summer, I still think you should hit up professors\u2026 I can\u2019t imagine why you shouldn\u2019t be able to do stats research remotely",

It shows that you have the basic ability to shot up on time and get your job done without getting fired, which is like, *surprisingly* rare.\n\nThat said, if you can get any kind of undergraduate research experience in your senior year, that's probably the best industry-relevant work experience you can get (seeing as summer internships are likely already hired and starting in like 2 weeks). Talk to professors you like and see what they're working on, peruse your department's website to see if any profs you *don't* know are doing cool research.",

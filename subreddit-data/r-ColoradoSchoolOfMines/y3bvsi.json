    "postText": "It is pretty clear that the school has declined over the last few years, with absolutely abhorrent price gouging for students in resident life, worsening food quality due to switching to Sodexo, and a general worsening of department quality of life (looking at you Computer Science and Geology departments in particular).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe rankings have finally slowly started to decrease for Mines (In 2017 we were ranked #75. In 2021 we were ranked #83. This year we dropped to #89 in national universities rankings).\n\nWith the current mismanagement of funds and the universally despised influx of new students increasing to a ridiculous 1450 freshman this year how much longer do you all think we have until we start dropping in the rankings even faster?",

Even just recently there was a faculty murder-suicide.\n\nThey definitely are not doing well with hiring faculty and providing resources. Faculty has been pretty low quality my entire time here and doesn't show signs of improving. Parking and housing have been a joke for a while. Housing at Mines park at least is way overpriced and gives very few benefits while restricting your rights. \n\nFor parking the last parking garage built was \\~8 months behind schedule I believe and has been filled to capacity the majority of the time now. This is also compounded by the school saying they were going to redo parts of Mines park and people moving out. Those students now have to drive to campus, flooding the non-existent parking. The best part is that they have decided to not even do the renovations.",

Comes up a lot when I lurk on r/Professors.\n\nAlso, students in calculus 1 are selected for folks who didn't take/have access to/pass AP Calculus. (I don't know how the distribution is overall, I was a transfer student and came in with the full calculus sequence taken elsewhere.)\n\n&gt; I saw a decline in difficulty of classes as well.\n\nInteresting.

That's probably the biggest factor in the drop there (though selectivity being a factor goes to show one way the ranking algorithm is questionable). Odd that they'd be doing that when the school isn't exactly starved for students.\n\nNot to say that rankings should actually be a factor in admin decisions. Increasing admissions rates when the school is packed to bursting just seems like a bad idea in its own right.",

The admissions office admits students with the expectation that a certain percentage of students will decline. The last two years, the percentage of students declining was much lower than anticipated (likely due to shifting pandemic numbers) so the total number of attending students increased. They intend to grow by about 1-3% per year, but the last two years have been between 10-15%",

With the recent economic downturn accelerating the decline in student enrollment at four-year universities, my guess is that future students are going to be looking at the ROI of their undergraduate education rather than the rankings of the school. It will be more important for university to place students in good and well paying jobs, then it is for students to get a prestigious but useless degree. Also, US News rankings are broken and easily gamified (see what happened to Colombia as a recent case study).",

I believe the CS department here has hired five in the past year, and are looking to hire a good deal more over the next few years --- that's actually a decent hiring rate. There are definitely plenty of shrinking computer science departments (see Wyoming), so the fact that Mines looking to add more faculty is also a good sign. There will likely be a number of talks in the spring semester from potential faculty candidates; make sure you go to those!\n\nMines is far from the only university to use students to make up for the lack of faculty, but I agree it's a problem. It's also much (MUCH) worse at some other universities, trust me. (Especially large state schools)",

It may have been a good school at some point but now there are only a couple of programs that can even really be considered worthwhile.\n\nIts ridiculously overpriced, especially for what you get. Mines Market is a prime example of that. I haven't checked prices in a while but when I had to get a meal plan it was cheaper to pay per entry than the plan, unless you went unlimited and went more than 3 times a day. And thats for fairly low quality food. I've been to and worked at places that have to feed more people in a shorter time frame and its almost always been better food.\n\nSo many of the professors also have been in academia their entire lives. So they don't have any actual experience with making things work and unfortunately are too stubborn to learn. Often times they also will not answer questions, rather forcing you to go to their TA if they have one who half the time will also be unwilling to help.\n\nMines may have been a good school at one time, but now its simply a way to squeeze money out of people. Companies don't hire Mines students because its a good school, its because we'll put up with more junk. Just about any standard work week will be better than one at Mines.",

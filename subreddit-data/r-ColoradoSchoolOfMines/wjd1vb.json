    "postText": "Pretty much the title. This school has gone drastically downhill over the past few years. Especially in the CS department, there are some of THE WORST teachers I have ever seen, some of which are EARNING their master's degree at Mines and teaching the fundamental courses. The acceptance rate has blown up, and I know first-year students that cannot even take derivatives. This school has gone down the gutter, and it's honestly such a sad sight to see. This post is mainly for prospective students who want to learn more about this school. Don't come here. There have been so many first-year students the past few years that they don't even have enough classes for the first-year students and have them take 12 credits. The suicide rate is incredibly high, and Golden sucks. Run.",

            "comment": "This post is missing a lot of context just based on the fact you give no information about yourself. Did you just fail 261 and blame it on the fact that it wasn\u2019t a seasoned professor? Or are you succeeding but feel like your money is going to waste because you feel you aren\u2019t learning enough due to professor quality?\n\nThe reasoning for this post would change my perception of it entirely. \n\nRegardless, I will give my take. \n\nOvercrowding has definitely become an issue at Mines. This problem is not exclusive to Mines, but it is very noticeable. \n\nA first year student being unable to take derivatives is either a lie or something you encountered in the first month of their first year. Either way, this is a nonissue. \n\nYou mention professors being bad. I had a much different experience. I had some grad students teaching 2 of my into CS classes. One was great, the other not so much. Professors in CS definitely become more knowledgeable in your later years at Mines, however. Again, hard to really talk about this point without knowing more of your reasonings for this post. \n\nI can\u2019t even begin to reason with you about Golden being bad. Maybe you never leave your dorm, or you have never been to another town in your life, but Golden is amazing. \n\nMy personal experience with Mines has been wonderful. I had a few bad professors, and hated a few classes, but I finished and got a rather high paying job. I have interacted with CS majors from other schools in Colorado. I can honestly tell you that I have experienced that the education received and projects completed at Mines have been superior to most of what I have heard from other CS grads I have talked to. This is just my experience, and others may have the opposite experience.",

Also I feel atleast with comp sci courses I\u2019ve taken (only csci 101 and 102 admittedly) I feel that cost college grads could easily each this course with a proper lesson plan and ability to speak to a crowd. Also the golden sucks thing I feel can be somewhat biased, as someone who grew up in a similar town in the PNW relative to size I felt like Golden was a nice transition for me to college compared to going to a large state school, also being in Golden and 5 minutes away from hiking, biking or tubing in clear creek is amazing.",

I\u2019m at MSU now because they offered me a ton of scholarships, benefits, and opportunity. It\u2019s not prestigious by any means, but ask anyone in the industry and they\u2019ll tell you:\nUnless your career is going to be in academia, nobody cares where you get your CS degree from as long as it\u2019s a credible university. Abet accreditation helps because it signals that the program has been around for a while at whatever school you decide to go to, but is by no means a requirement. As long as you\u2019re learning CS from good professors, retaining that information, and putting it to use in projects, it\u2019ll take you much further than the name of a school. \n\nI had a professor give me a piece of advice that improved my quality of life substantially:\n\nSometimes it\u2019s better to make yourself the big fish in a small pond, rather than join all the other big fish. Go somewhere where the workload is manageable so you have time to work on projects, because is CS, a portfolio is everything.\n\nI also just hate how accessibility to professors at Mines is so difficult at times. I hate working with TAs. No offense to all the dedicated TAs out there, just not my style of learning. Especially when I\u2019m paying thousands upon thousands to be there. \n\nAnyway, forgive my rant, and best of luck with everything. I\u2019m sure at the end of the day, you\u2019ll make the decisions that best fit your needs. That could be mines, or that could be somewhere else. Just keep your options open c:",

I do think that more work needs to be done to give resources (teaching staff, classrooms, chairs) to first year courses that are seeing crazy high enrollment.\n\nI am an alum and recently graduated from the Geology and Geological Engineering department with my bachelor's, which I believe has a COMPLETELY different environment than described above. Many amazing TAs/professors I've had in this department don't come from an engineering background (and therefore may not know how to take a derivative) and are extremely skilled and knowledgable in this field. The faculty and TAs are qualified, smart, and dedicated to helping their students succeed in and out of school.\n\nThis is a reminder that even the departments within Mines are all run differently, some better than others. This is something for prospective students to consider as they decide what they want to study. Golden and Mines have much more to offer than described here.",

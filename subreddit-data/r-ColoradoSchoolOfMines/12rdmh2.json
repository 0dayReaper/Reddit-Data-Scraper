    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming geophysics major going into the PhD program in applied math. Anyone else join the program coming from a non math or non physics program? What\u2019s it like?\n\nI\u2019m excited and have always enjoyed math. I\u2019ve completed linear algebra, diff eq, calc 1-3, and a \u201cmath methods for physics\u201d course that briefly touches on PDEs. They weren\u2019t terrible and I enjoyed the real world applications of math while disliked the more abstract stuff.",

                    "comment": "I (kinda) did the opposite - undergrad in both math/statistics &amp; GP, masters in GP. So I don't know much about the graduate level math courses. But the other comment about proofs is correct. Many of my math courses focused solely on proofs. Also, AEM only covers a fraction of what you'd learn in the PDE course. \n\nWhile your GP coursework obviously require a significant amount of math, be prepared to bring your theorems out to the 9th+ degree vs only the 2nd or 3rd on a regular basis. Your math courses will focus more on the theory while GP put more emphasis on the results which is why the theorems will be extended out to such a high nth degree. That level of granularity doesn't significantly effect the results in a meaningful way.\n\nEdit: Oops! I meant to make this a separate comment instead of a reply. I'm just going to leave it as is though.",

If you\u2019ve taken all the calcs and diffeq and maybe some PDEs then you should be able to learn all the math stuff, but proofs are kind of a different and importantly formal way of going about things that we didn\u2019t do in physics at all.",

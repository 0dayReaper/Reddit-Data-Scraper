I don't know any EE + CS combos, unfortunately, so I can't offer anything specific to your situation.\n\nIn any case, what got you thinking about double majors? Interested in both EE and CS and having a hard time choosing?",

A friend and I both did comp sci minors (he did EE major and I did ChemE) and then we both ended up as software engineers for our jobs. A minor in CS is plenty for a job in tech. \n\n\nBut if you\u2019re planning to double major it will probably just take 5-ish years. It\u2019s more classes and classes are hard here haha. \n\n\nAlso if you reach out to the registrar I bet they\u2019d lay it out for you",

Only difference with a comp sci minor is your electives go out the window. Also you could consider mastering in comp sci if you get a comp sci minor, allowing you to graduate in 5 years with a masters. I'd say graduating in 5 years with a masters is far better than 5 years with two majors.",

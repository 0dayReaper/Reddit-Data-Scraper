    "postText": "I got a job during the pandemic and left Mines a year before finishing ChemE, and I'm considering going back but switching over to QBE. Do any of you have thoughts on the program? I'm already fluent in Python and know my way around genetics and immunology, plus it's the same time-to-graduation. I seriously don't want to go back but my cheif medical officer is really encouraging it so I'm trying to see if QBE might be a little more enjoyable than the ChemE life.",

QBE wasn't a thing when I left Mines, but I was taking those classes off-major anyway, so I'd be coming in at junior level if that helps.",

Im a peer mentor as well as a calc ta and I have time to do all that with 5 clubs and Greek life. I'm also a semester ahead in credits which helps me from having heavy credit hour semesters (I usually take 13-15).",

The work is much more programming / analysis focused, and the workload has honestly been very doable. I work two jobs outside of school and haven't had any issues with my classes in QBE. They're still in the process of refining the courses (things like required courses and possible electives) but there's a lot of variety, and a decent number of interdisciplinary courses if you have the background of a different major. Already knowing python is a plus, but the profs are super understanding (and Dr. Beeler is the BEST) and are very willing to help!",

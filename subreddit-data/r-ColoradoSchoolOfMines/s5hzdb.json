    "postText": "First year Spruce resident here. As the title suggests I'm looking for some apartment that I could split rent with. I'm flexible with where (as long as I can walk/ride a bike to campus) and am not sure about budget right now. \n\nFor an apartment, I'm looking for 1-2 people.\n\nA little about me would be:\n\nI'm an 18 year old woman from Broomfield (family possibly moving to Arvada within the next year), I love to bake and cook as well as be around my pet bird. \n\nI am a rather messy person, which I am working on. Until I feel like I am much better, though, you may have to be willing to put up with me being messy. Chores I would love to split 50/50 as well as rent.\n\n As far as pets go, I love animals! Reptiles, mammals, birds, you name it I'll give it affection. With exception to bugs, which I would rather enjoy from a distance. I'm totally fine with pets and if I could, I would bring my bird. However she is FAR too loud for an apartment.\n\nIf you're interested in renting with me next year, please PLEASE respond! I'd love to set up a time to talk in person and get to know each other more before making a decision. \n\nThanks!",

    "postText": "[https://minesparkredevelopment.com/](https://minesparkredevelopment.com/)\n\nI just received an email from a very excited administrator that they are planning to demolish mines park in order to renovate and more than double the number of beds. I've looked at [https://www.mines.edu/masterplan/](https://www.mines.edu/masterplan/) and it seems that they have a long term goal of increasing the student body by several thousand students and reaching 100 million in funded research. Students will be feeling this construction in mines park Summer of 2022-2024. The destruction of the commuter lot off of Washington is another part of the expansion plan. In addition to 1750 Jackson, the proposed expansions include ALL of the parking lots in front of the CTLM.  I'd assume these buildings include underground parking, but I don't know. Regardless, I feel that the impact this construction will have on student life, commutes, and the Mines culture will be extensive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the expansion? Are you for or against the instruction if it means new facilities? Personally I think it's too much. I was happy at with the first phase, but having four phases and doubling the student population defeats the reason I came to this school over CU. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n This is the community meeting about the Mines Park project.

That's an increase of around 800 students over the next few years.  A lot, yeah, but not thousands, and certainly not doubling the whole student body.\n\nParking lots are part of the plan.  If you follow OP's source, you can verify that for yourself.\n\n##I'm going to lock this thread and put up a new one, sans the sensationalism, with all the same resources and information.  This is an important topic to discuss, and you can agree or disagree with the school's plans.  But for that discussion to be productive we need to have the facts straight first and not just be reacting out of outrage.\n\n^(Friendly reminder I don't work for the administration. I do this in my free time. Nobody fucking ordered me to do this. You don't need to message me calling me a pawn of PCJ or whatever BS again)",

            "comment": "In a grand sense, it's great that Mines is capitalizing on its reputation that has been getting more widely recognized in recent years.\n\nHowever at a student level, I'm worried that they aren't taking into account how these changes will affect student life. For me, this school is becoming unrecognizable from when I came in as a freshman in 2015. If I was a HS senior applying to colleges today, I think the chance of me choosing Mines would be much lower. Especially as a student who bore the brunt of the growing pains that came with the expansions, the unique atmosphere that initially drew me to Mines in the first place, is almost completely gone. It feels corporatized and lifeless compared to a few years ago.\n\nThe thing that worries me the most about this plan is that there seems to be comparatively little to no investment in student life and mental health. Sure, by 2030 the campus will all be nice and shiny but what does that mean on an internal, personal level? If they can't address the mental health crisis that has been ravaging Mines head on, I see no reason to buy into these proposed changes.\n\nBut yeah it looks great on paper I guess",

            "comment": "Expanding the school is gonna lead to a lot of good things for the school business wise. Obviously they have more people coming in and paying tuition but they'll also get more funding for research like you mentioned. This increase in student body will make the mines experience more enriching because there's just more culture. However I hope it doesn't muddy the education experience and create more conflict amongst students. A larger student body is always harder to manage and with that a lot more people are gonna be doing a lot more dumb shit. I'm also concerned that with people flooding in mines might have to bring down the extensive rigor in their programs. We've already seen it this year with them having to push back common hour exams because of how many freshman they accepted. It honestly might make things more stressful for everyone.",

The \"several thousand students\" is approximated to be around 800 more students by 2024, and the \"doubling\" is just doubling the ON-CAMPUS population, not the full student body. They're also (if i read this correctly) going to start building another parking area.",

I\u2019m glad I\u2019m graduating next semester so I can get the hell out before this shitshow is put into play.  It\u2019s gonna be a mess for new students trying to find places to live, park, and pick schedules.  Not against them expanding, but considering that many departments are lacking the assistance they need, as well as are inability to add new departments (aerospace, actual geology (not engineering), biology, etc.) I don\u2019t see this as a positive.  For the money you pay, might as well travel 20 min north to Boulder.  Also, this even fails to mention how shitty extracurricular are at this school.  One year of helping run a club has taught me that trying to start, maintain, and do outreach for students is a nightmare because of how things are run and managed by higher ups.  There\u2019s a reason people aren\u2019t hanging out on campus during the weekends\u2026..",

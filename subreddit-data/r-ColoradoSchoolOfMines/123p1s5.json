Quantitative bio-science is a new and strong program, very stellar professors.  If you can take organic chemistry at a community college you should, it will save you a lot of stress. I would look into an chemical engineering degree with bio specialty from what your interest are and then you have a very productive option if you find that medical school is not what you want after a few years.",

I finished my freshman year with a 2.8, but finished my degree with a 3.439 before pursuing my M.S. in another field.\n\n It was reasonable to get a 3.7 + each semester as an EE (one of the 3 hardest on campus - one of the factors mentioned above is degree choice), but since I started with a low GPA I was unable to finish with a higher GPA. \n\nMind you, this was attending classes and doing homework and test prep with my \"squad\" (me + 2 EE colleagues who built the same schedule for 2.5 years) from 8am - 7pm M-Thurs, 8a - 3pm Fri, 12p - 3pm Sat, 12p - 5p Sun (again EE is one of the 3 most difficult degrees on campus). \n\nIf you start high and keep the work consistent, it isn't too bad! You'll get your groove down over time, just don't drop your GPA while getting your groove down.\n\nEDIT: I was able to start my career at P&amp;G as a manager making $92k annually with 3.44 BS in EE and 3.67 MS in ETM from Mines if that provides any information for outcomes with a certain GPA out of Mines \u26a1\ud83d\udc4d",

I do have a colleague who just got into San Diego State Med School (among a few others) who did work within the Biochem course path at Mines, however I'm unsure what her degree was formally within. ChemE is one of the other big 3 along with Petro for difficulty (note - Mining Engineering is its own tier/beast as it is the #1 Mining Engineering program in the world). \n\nI'd reach out to the Biochem people on campus and get a better understanding of their course path, course work, and the opportunities that arise for that degree path.\n\nVery Important Information - your career path is going to be defined primarily by your internship choices and activities that you become involved in (undergrad research, etc.). Anyone within a Chem field (Chem, ChemE, Biochem, etc.) can work within a Biochem field and realistically a ChemE degree may better prepare you than a pure Biochemistry degree. \n\nBest recommendation is to understand the industry (do your own research) and touch base with Biochem peeps at Mines (both undergrad and grad since all you're looking for is information - departments and students if you can find them) and ask them questions you've determined to be important for your decision.",

Plans and majors change often, even when it feels like you\u2019re 100% decided on &lt;insert career&gt;.

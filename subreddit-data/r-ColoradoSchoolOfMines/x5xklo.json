And you might not get your money back this semester, I believe you had to have purchased some sort of insurance if you want to get your money back after dropping a class. Also, if you wait until after census date then it'll appear on your transcript as a Withdrawal\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss.",

As others mentioned the biggest problem will be any financial aid you have being ineligible for but that\u2019s not a for sure as general financial aid eligibility is 6 credits or more but as others mentioned full time status is 12 credits. Otherwise you should be fine CSCI 101+102 some people wait to do it until senior year just because they don\u2019t need it.",

            "comment": "So CSCI 101 (and 102 bc i think it\u2019s the lab) is required for all majors, it\u2019s a general requirement for everyone (unfortunately lol) from my understanding. However, you could probably drop it and either take it online (like I plan to do next summer) or take it later and not run into too many issues with your major\u2019s track because I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a pre-req for much besides more CSCI classes. I\u2019m not sure on all the details, but I know you run into issues with under 12 credit hours because you are then a part-time student. It complicates things like housing and tuition payments. \n\nI would definitely recommend scheduling a meeting with either your CASA advisor or someone at the Registar. It\u2019s possible that you could drop that class and add on a few electives like Engineering Your Career or something with less credit hours and far less work so that you could keep your full time student status and lessen your workload to something more manageable. They\u2019re going to be able to help you a lot more than anyone on Reddit and will have some real options for you. Wish you the best and I hope that you find a good solution!",

I just called the registrar, asked if I could have an emergency withdrawal from one class due to the death of an immediate family member, and they took care of it from there. It was very easy. I should say that I don't have any scholarships or anything, so I don't need to maintain a certain number of credits or gpa. But there were no consequences for simply being a part-time student; it's normal and there's nothing wrong with it. I would encourage you to withdraw from whatever class you think will help lighten your load, and don't think twice about it. It's just school; you've surely realized yourself that there are more important things in life than that. I wish you the best, and I hope you take some time to process things and heal.",

But rest assured you\u2019re not the only one struggling with the class \ud83d\ude05",

While I\u2019m over here struggling to understand what the professor said and how he calculated the problem within a split second:(((((  I felt as if I\u2019m the dumbest one in the class rn\u2026.Do you happen to know where I can find a study group ?",

I also know last year in spruce someone put up a sign up sheet for different class study groups and used those. If you don\u2019t know a ton of ppl in the class though I would recommend trying the CASA tutors or hiring a paid tutor. Hope you figure it out, best of luck!",

Honestly, I spent time outside of class catching up with videos and practice problems because I was afraid of falling behind so early into the sem. I totally get feeling like the only one who doesn\u2019t get it but trust me you\u2019re not the only one. Im trying find a study group too! Do you wanna meet up sometime and study??",

(This was 20 years ago - the course contents could have easily changed though I imagine the same awful professor is probably around still.)\n\nBut when I struggled, Schaum's Outline really helped.  (I had to get the physics one, too.)\n\nThe library shows advanced Calc is available online in PDF now - you don't even have to buy it:\n\nhttps://mines.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01COLSCHL_INST/fmq2oa/cdi_mcgrawhill_accessengineeringlibrary_ccn00337368\n\nThere might be online resources available too, but this is an old standby that \"you kids\" might not be aware of and thought I'd throw it out there.  They are really the original \"for dummies\" books, but really \"for dumb engineers\" (like me).",

Taking math in the smaller, more intimate CC classes with good professors is the only reason I was able to get through math, tbh.\n\nOtherwise, hit up tutoring and CASA. Study, practice, and practice some more. Math is a lot of ripping your hair out, but eventually you'll get there.",

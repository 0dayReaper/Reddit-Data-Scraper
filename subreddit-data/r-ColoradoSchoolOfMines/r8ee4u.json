If so, Mines has incredible hydrology-related faculty (in the civil/env and geology departments) and research.  If you're headed that way I would unequivocally recommend Mines (and probably environmental; you'll be a little weaker on the actual hydrology, but it seems to have much better employment opportunities).",

I'm a high school senior going into environmental engineering and I only applied to Mines and Michigan Tech because those were the only ones that interested me. Both are out of state for me and rather far away. I visited both, Michigan has slightly better food, is a bit cheaper, and has an extremely rural, cold atmosphere. Mines definitely feels more modern and will likely land you a nicer job at the end of the day but also seems more challenging. Currently I'm leaning Mines despite Tech's clearly superior mascot. If you are in state for either of them I would probably choose that one but the decision ultimately comes down to which one you feel most comfortable at. Feel free to DM me for anything.",

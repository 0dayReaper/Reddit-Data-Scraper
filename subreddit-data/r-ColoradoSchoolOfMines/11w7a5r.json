    "postText": "It's a few semesters before I can take any of the ME advanced electives, but I'm trying to get a feel for them. MEGN 412 is the only one that I don't know anyone who's taken it. So if you have, I'd love to hear about it! Like is it more like solid mechanics or more like the engineered materials class? And what do you think about the level of difficulty? Really any thoughts that come to your mind :)",

            "comment": "I took it in 2009 from Dr berger. I always liked taking his classes, as he was the smartest professor I ever had, and taught the material well. \nThe course built on mechanics of materials (or strengths, as we called it) content. But then added linear algebra. You can do a lot of cool stuff combining matrices with mechanics of materials.",

            "comment": "This class with Dr Berger was my favorite class at mines. I only took it because I happened to have Berger for reg. MoM and loved him as a prof. I had an interesting journey though. I failed the first test (67% or something). This was my worst test grade of all tests at mines and this would prevent me from getting an A. Dr Berger had an amazing test review and motivational / encouraging speech after this (a lot of people did bad). I perfected the second test (100%) and ended up with an A in the course because Dr. Berger saw my improvement. \n\nAlso one of the most interesting subjects I had studied, I especially enjoyed fatigue / fracture portions and solving 3d stess/strain. \n\nHope this helps. Everyone has different interests but there no denying how great of a Professor Dr. Berger is.",

I wish I'd taken more 400/500 level classes over the bs like cs101 or whatever electives I took.\n\nPoint is, don't think you have to limit yourself to 1 of the advanced classes. They are very rewarding so don't be scared to choose!",

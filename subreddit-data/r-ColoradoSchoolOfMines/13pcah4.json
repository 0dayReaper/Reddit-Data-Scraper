But as someone else said, it's not in Golden. If you are just looking to lift. Once upon a time, I lived in Wheatridge near their rec center. I have typically found city rec centers cheaper than most other places. So, as someone else said - I would check out Golden Rec Center. I know ... just full of useful advice - do what the other guy already said.  That being said I think it depends on what you are trying to get out of it or what you want to do otherwise. I have a buddy that's a climber and his climbing gym has a decent weights area with some cardio machines as well. I also went to that 24 off of union once in a while during school.",

            "comment": "DONT TAKE TOO MANY CREDITS YOUR FIRST SEMESTER! This is my biggest piece of advice. It will cause a lot of stress and it could kill your GPA. You can decide to take summer courses to make up for a class (taking one class over the summer is cake compared to doing it over the semester.)\n\nAlso, its hard. If my dumbass is capable of making it through, I know anyone else can. That being said, its still very difficult. I usually study anywhere from 15-25 hours per exam on top of homework. If you study you\u2019ll be fine and the hard work will pay off. Despite the immense workload, it\u2019s crucial that you don\u2019t give yourself crippling anxiety over it, although that\u2019s easier said than done. Just keep in mind that you\u2019ll be okay no matter what happens. You\u2019ll have enough time for yourself to relax and keep up your hobbies. Despite what people say, you aren\u2019t locking yourself in a box for four years and working the whole time. You\u2019ll still have a life.\n\nAlso, the community is great. You\u2019ll meet a lot of people. During my senior year of hs, I joined a discord server set up by incoming freshmen to mines. It helped me meet people before the year started and I made friends that way.",

Figure out which coffee shop/kiosk is closest to your classes/your favorite and be nice to those baristas. They will become your saviors for late nights/bad days. \n\n3. Get involved with the department early somehow. There are lots of hackathons or work in the department as a front desk rep. It gets you access to professors to build a relationship that will help your career both academically and professionally. Some departments have department specific scholarships that are determined by professors which applicant wins. Helps to be a name well known by the department. \n\n4. MINES IS A MARATHON NOT A SPRINT!!! Take breaks. Allow yourself to completely collapse at fall/winter/spring break if they need to. Taking a semester off is not the worst thing in the world (I wish I had done that\u2026 would\u2019ve saved me a ton of money in therapy costs post graduation). \n\n5. Mines is hard. If you feel like you don\u2019t belong, give it 8 weeks. I found sometimes it was just a hard spot in a class or a stress response to a bunch of assignments/tests coming in all at once. If you still feel that way 8 weeks later - there is no shame in transferring or taking a semester off to reevaluate. \n\n6. Time management! No one way works for everyone and it\u2019s a learning process that you will likely try and fail for the first 1-4 semesters. I finally figured it out going into my junior year and it made a world of difference. You\u2019re a helluva engineer - prototype and test and redesign. \n\nBest of luck!",

If he can get in the groove (even if it takes some bad/failing grades in a few classes to figure things out) it will get easier. \n\nI had a lot of friends drop out in the first two semesters - they probably would have been okay had they stuck it out. Things got much easier in Junior year once I was in my major.\n\nAlso, if he is struggling in a class I would recommend getting extra help early rather than sticking it out and hoping it gets better.

Don\u2019t worry about placing out of classes or trying to get in the highest possible class. In math, for example, Mines requires three semesters of calculus, which Mines labels MATH 111, 112 and 113. Your student likely had lots of calculus in high school, but there is nothing wrong with starting in MATH 111 at Mines. If it\u2019s a little bit of review, and he gets an easier A, there\u2019s no harm in that. (Notice that I said \u201ceasier\u201d A because there are no easy As at Mines.) Also, MATH 111 will be all first years, so he can meet his peers. What is the rush to start the first semester in MATH 112???\n3. Office hours, office hours, office hours.\n4.

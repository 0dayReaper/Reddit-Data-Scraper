            "comment": "This is going to sound like a non-answer, and it kind of is, but focus on something you are interested in and want to pursue. For example, if you want to go more into hardware choose computer engineering or robotics. If you want to work with spacecraft choose space or Intelligence Systems. Business go the Comp-Business route. \n\nThe general track is far easier in the sense that you have a lot more freedom in what you choose to pursue. You'll likely finish faster than the other more specialized tracks. So it really depends on how you want to sell yourself. Let's be frank, you can go into anything with any of the specialties - they aren't a pre-req. But do you want that extra knowledge going into a career? I don't know. \n\nThere truly is not a \"best\" focus area just as there isn't a \"best\" engineering major. Pick what you're interested in and run with it.",

I took classes in ML, cryptography, and business and all of them counted towards my degree. Employers don't care about you getting signed off on a focus area as long as you can show you learned the right stuff.",

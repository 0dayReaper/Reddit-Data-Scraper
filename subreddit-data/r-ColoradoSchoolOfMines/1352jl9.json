At least, that was my experience. They didn't help when I was in school during the late 00s, they didn't help in the mid 10s when I was trying to change industries. They also inflate their job placement numbers by counting grad school acceptances in their stats.\n\nI don't have any real help to offer, but I'd agree with other posters. Get any job. Look on craigslist, and all the job boards for engineering jobs. I think there would be good student, it looks level science tech positions with the govt. Look at USAJOBS.gov.",

Maybe I\u2019m a little biased because I worked there over the summer, but they do a lot more than other universities in terms of services to students. They are some of the nicest people to and have helped me countless times outside of their normal 8-5 hours. They also do all the data collection for the average salaries of each major per year.\nAs for getting a job, it took me till mid March to get an actual interview with a human instead of a technical coding assessment. What really helped me is applying to the companies that aren\u2019t as major or well known/smaller companies. I wish you luck with your job search",

It was like I was a different person showing up at career fair asking for full time positions instead of internships. Reps wanted to talk to me, I got interviews; it was as advertised.\n\nI only ended up getting an internship between my senior year and first year of grad school because of a personal connection. I'm convinced that's the only way to get one without either huge persistence or some major distinguishing qualities like major extracurricular involvement or presenting yourself significantly more professionally than your peers.\n\nYou're not a failure for not landing an internship. I'd bet over half of Mines students never get one in their whole time here. If you get one, great, that's a big leg up, but if not, yes it sucks in the moment, but you'll do just fine.",

You've been lied to if you think you'll get a real job before you have even graduated.\n\nWait until you graduate. Then apply for jobs. And you may have to apply for shitty jobs. And it might take a couple months. When I graduated I got a job testing concrete in the hot sun all day (my degree is geotech engineering), because you have to start at the bottom. I quit and was selling solar panels in best buy. I was a Lyft driver for a summer. Then I went back to shitty construction jobs. You have to do the shit jobs. \n\nYou aren't a failure yet. You haven't even started. Applying for jobs before you graduate is practically meaningless. Nobody hires students. Especially not in a recession. You need skills to get a good job. If you don't have skills yet somehow (thanks a lot mines), you'll have to settle for a bad job. Work a bad shitty job for a year to get skills. Then apply at a different company and move up.\n\nAlso. Get a damn drivers license. Almost nobody hires people who can't drive. You are not eligible for any job that says \"requires a valid drivers license\" or similar verbiage. Entry level jobs usually require you to drive around and do field work. You are shooting yourself in the foot by not being able to drive. Your parents are to blame for this, but you need to just do it yourself. Take a class, get a drivers license. Kind of crazy that you don't have one yet. \n\nSorry but this is the truth. You're blaming the career center, but you are missing some fucking important pieces right now. No wonder nobody is hiring you. You are a student with no drivers license, even if I wanted to hire you, I am literally not allowed to hire you, because you don't meet those basic requirements for most jobs (can drive, has a degree). You can fix this. You can do it. It is NOT over, you've got plenty of potential. Graduate, get a license, apply for shitty entry level jobs. Look at government jobs. Work a shitty job for a year and then make a lateral move. It took me 3 years at a shitty job before I got a good one.",

I have several friends who were EE majors, and worked in physical places doing physical electrical work, like server room maintenance for google, for example. He had to drive to a building to go fix things with screwdrivers and a soldering iron.\n\nYes, there are jobs where you don't drive. And there are jobs where you do drive. And yes you can commute by bus, and then drive the company car. I did a job where I commuted by bike, and drove a company truck to job sites. I strongly recommend you learn to drive and get a license EVEN IF you don't own a car. It's a very important skill, for a million practical reasons and many legal ones. It's just an option every adult should have. You're limiting yourself by not having that option.\n\nI am trying to help you with practical advice. Would you rather (a) apply for great jobs that pay well and don't require a license and NOT get those jobs because they're extremely competitive; or (b) lower your standards, increase your skills and hireability, and get a mediocre job which is a stepping stone to get your career started? The choice seems to be yours. I'm trying to be encouraging but honest. I'm sick of these posts like \"I can't get a job I'm a failure I'm worthless\" like dude, you can get a damn construction job the day after you graduate. Electricians are in super high demand. The trades are desperate for skilled physical workers (and they will train you on the job). You have to drive to a house and fix a light fixture and you'll get paid very well to do it. Or you can fight a thousand other people with more experience than you for a cool desk job in a cool company.",

I am not an US Citizen, and it's really hard to find a positions that i can apply., let alone getting accepted to one.  i got rejected by all the summer internships/research programs. \n\nI looked up research I was actually interested in and emailed the authors, mostly professors but also some industry people.  While I only have an unpaid research position  at my institution for this summer, (I was too late when i started emailing), I now have two unofficial offers for next summer, 1 from well known institution and 1 from a company  just from cold emailing. \n\nAlthough you may not get what you want this summer,  you may get what you dreamt of next summer.",

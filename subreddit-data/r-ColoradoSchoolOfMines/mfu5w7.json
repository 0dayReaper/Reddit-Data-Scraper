    "postText": "I was recently accepted into the AES masters program here at Mines and I am not sure who my primary advisor is. My acceptance letter listed my primary contact as the administrative director, who I had been in contact with for some time during my application. The student orientation says that this person should be the same as my advisor, but my trailhead lists another professor. I do not want to appear rude by emailing one when I should have emailed the other, any advice? Could I call the registrar?",

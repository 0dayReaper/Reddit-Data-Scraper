    "postText": "I unfortunately need to take DiffEQ and Chem 1 online over the summer to stay on track in my major. Does anybody have any advice as to which community colleges have the easiest classes?   \n\n\nThese are my options: \n\n* **ACC, CCA, CCD, CNCC, DCC, FRCC, MCC, NJC, OJC, PPCC, TSJC**\n* Arapahoe Community College\n* Community College of Aurora\n* Community College of Denver\n* Colorado Northwestern Community College\n* Denver Community College\n* Front Range Community College\n* Morgan Community College\n* Northeastern Junior College\n* Otero Junior College\n* Pikes Peak Community College\n* Trinidad State Junior College\n\nAll of the CCs will transfer classes to Mines and should have asynchronous online classes for Chem and DiffEQ\n\nThoughts?",

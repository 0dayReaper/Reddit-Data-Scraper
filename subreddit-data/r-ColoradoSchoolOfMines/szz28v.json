I\u2019ve been using a 15\u201d Dell I got when I started Fall of 2020, and it has no trouble with the newest solidworks. \nThe 17\u201d laptops are a beast to carry around. \nThere are quite a few labs and library computers that you can use too. A desk top will always give more performance for your dollar. So if you are also planning to game, that might be better. Personal I have an old desktop, and like the flexibility of the laptop. \nA number of professors do tests and quizzes online in class. So a laptop would be more helpful than a phone for those.",

I got these laptops for two oldest children when they went to college - - one who was in Computer Engineering. Worth the price tag.",

The only thing I regret about the XPS 13 is it not having a touch screen. Everyone I know who has a tablet or a 2 in 1 loves it, and it greatly simplifies the process of taking and organizing notes.",

            "comment": "I'd advocate for a gaming laptop with very good battery life. Obviously the more powerful a computer is the better it is in SOLIDWORKS or the like, but you'll probably want the additional study spaces that open up to you if your battery will last as long as you need it to last. \n\nThe Asus ROG G14 felt like a default recommendation back when it was a $1200 laptop, but with steep price hikes that is no longer the case. Ideally, I would look for anything with a graphics card and an 80 watt-hour battery. If you've got more of a budget, you'll want a Ryzen laptop or something with Intel Iris XE for better integrated graphics. As an example of that, the Framework laptop is an awesome machine for an engineer to have.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone. I'm an incoming transfer student for the fall semester. I have already set up my trailhead portal but I was trying to find out where can i apply for scholarships? And is it normal that I only got a 3,000 grant from financial aid for the fall semester? Usually this number at UCD was somewhere around 5k.",

I recently graduated (and got hired), but a common sentiment was that Mines' students got pushed to the top of the pile. I've heard some places even exclusively hire only Mines' graduates.\n\nThat being said, there's a reason the average GPA at Mines is below 3.0. It is hard, so be prepared for it to consume a large chunk of your life.",

As for professors, we have really great ones with a few exceptions. However the bad apples are rare enough that a rate my professor search can weed them out and you can avoid them when registering. The main downside of the program for me is the lack of industry area specialization, specifically in aerospace. We have only one, maybe two as of this semester, specific industry level aerospace courses when the field employs a majority of our graduates.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone - I am currently a senior in HS (out of state) and am down to deciding between CSM (accepted) and Virginia Tech for a major in Mining Engineering. I am leaning towards attending Mines but I have a few questions I think would be best answered by current students at CSM. \n\nFeel no pressure to answer all of these - if there is just one question that you think you can answer, that's alright with me :)\n\nHere goes:\n\n1. As mentioned above, I am planning on majoring in Mining Engineering - what can you say about the program in general? Pros/cons? Good/bad professors? Anything you know would help!\n\n\n2. I am interested in also minoring in explosive engineering - I noticed that most of the class options to fulfill the 9 hours that aren't the required classes are classes I will have taken anyway as a mining engineer major. Will those classes count towards the minor and the major at the same time? How to \"free electives\" from my major factor in to this, if at all? Keep in mind that I will have tested out of a decent amount of classes from high school (calc 1,2, and 3 to name a couple) so hopefully this means I'll have some extra flexibility for extra classes\n\n\n3. My sister attends CU Boulder and has some friends at Mines. Some of them say that the culture is a little competitive - what has your experience been like with other students at Mines, especially during your freshman year?\n\n\n4. Residence hall recommendations? I am thinking Spruce Hall based on a small amount of research should I attend Mines - feel free to let me know anything you know about residence halls pros and cons\n\n\n5. How are the sporting events? I am a huge sports fan so wondering if football games/other sports are well attended and have a passionate fanbase\n\n6. Anything else you think would be beneficial for me to hear is welcome!\n\nThank you so much for helping me out!",

            "comment": "Of the 4 people I knew that did Mining Engineering, only one still works in mining. I think the program is pretty good, but I would look around at what career you\u2019d like to pursue in Mining before majoring in it. If you\u2019re passionate about Mining careers, Mines is a great school for it. There\u2019s the Edgar experimental mine in Idaho Springs that is pretty dang cool, it\u2019s even got an underground classroom in the Mine. \n\nI also recommend the trads, they were the most social when I was there too (but that was 10 years ago\u2026 now I feel old).\n\nCulture is much more \u201ccollective suffering\u201d than \u201ccompetitive\u201d, I\u2019d say. \n\nI can\u2019t accurately answer #2 but I\u2019d imagine that things in-major will count towards the minor. An advisor for Mining might be able to help out more. \n\nHappy to answer any other questions you might have.",

            "comment": "I can throw in some input about 3. and 4.\n\n3. I'm a freshman this year and I haven't boticed any conpetition really amongst students. So far it seems everyone is happy to work together and struggle through classes together. At the end of the day everyone is here to get a degree and get a job. Classes can be hard and you probably wont always make A's or B's, but keep in mind C's get degrees so having friends who can help you study is important.\n\n4. Personally I chose to live in the traditional halls because of how they were advertised as being the most social dorms. Everyone on my floor just leaves their room doors open and just sort of hangs out when not busy. While I have heard that some dorms in the trads arent as social (Thomas and Morgan) I've had a great experience so far in Bradford. At the end of the day it really just depends on the other people on your floor and how you interact with them. I know some people living in Spruce and from what I've heard everyone just sort of does their own thing and leaves their doors closed. The lack of air conditioning in the trads really has not made me regret anything, just make sure you bring a fan of some sort and leave your room door open. After the first month or so it cools off and by that point you are used to the warmth. Some of the best ways to make friends though, regardless of dorm, is to go to oredigger camp if you can and especially go to the events during the first couple days on campus.",

            "comment": "Though I cannot answer the first two, for 3, I do not believe the culture is that competitive. In fact, the students here are often understanding of the difficulty everyone must go through and may even help you reach the same level of success they are pushing towards. \nFor question 4, Spruce is a great option, with its modern rooms and surplus of amenities. Many freshmen stay in the traditional halls, and though they may show their age the community established there is often stronger, which can be seen as vital to someone coming into a new school.\nFor question 5, yes, there are many sporting events. The Mines football team has been on a winning streak this semester and their games are interesting. The cross country team is also impressive, with Golden being a great place to go running in general. Any sport the school doesn\u2019t support (tennis :/ ), can be accessed nearby in town through another recreational facility.\nFor question 6, I would check the menu options online before eating at the Mines Market Cafeteria. The food there can be questionable in quality sometimes.",

Spruce has the biggest rooms of all the dorms and is overall nice, if you hear complaining about spruce, that is because last year, when we lived in it, it was drill under construction and was a massive shit show. Now that it is done, it is a very nice dorm, when I was there is was moderately social, not as much as the trads but not reclusive, which I liked as it allowed me to hunker down when necessary, but still be able to build some community.",

            "comment": "For #1, I can\u2019t say as I am not in the field. \n\nFor #2, I would check in with the school on that because I can\u2019t remember off the top of my head but I know there\u2019s one major/minor combination that is disallowed due to the massive overlap of credits. I doubt it\u2019s mining/explosives but it doesn\u2019t hurt to check.\n\nFor #3, as it is an engineering school, there certainly is a deal of competitiveness, but as long as you do the work and pay attention in class and seek help when needed, you\u2019ll be fine. \n\nFor #4, I\u2019m not sure how residence hall life is now as I was in the dorms before and at the onset of Covid. The advice I can give, however, is that if you\u2019re looking to be social and make a few to a lot of friends, most people say the the Trads are the way to go. I was in Bradford my freshman year and Maple my sophomore year and definitely preferred Maple, but that\u2019s just my advice. \n\nFor #5, even living off campus, it is easy to tell how passionate Mines is about its sports. Again, due to Covid stuff, I\u2019m unsure of how things have changed, but I\u2019m pretty sure Mines students get into football games for free. \n\nFor #6, my only other advice would be to not try and rush through here just to get your degree. Take it easy (but not TOO easy) and enjoy your time, regardless of whether you come here or choose to attend somewhere else. I\u2019m a senior but need to take an extra semester, and now I honestly wish I could go back in time to 2018 and tell myself to calm down (and tell myself to invest in some stocks, but that\u2019s besides the point). Also go to career fair and take advantage of the events on campus that offer free food and drink.",

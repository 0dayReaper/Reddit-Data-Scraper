    "postText": "Hey y'all, been a while. I'm taking Data Structures. Personally, it's been a good class so far.\n\nOne part of the syllabus has always struck out to me: \"You must pass the final (60% or higher) to pass this course\" despite the final only being 20% of the overall grade (rather than the largest part of the overall grade).\n\nAs someone who has averaged about 72% on my midterms, I'm not too worried. However, I am curious as to what happens if you actually fail the final.\n\nLet's say you have a 92% A thus far but you get a 59% on the final (brutal). Would the grade entered be the corresponding B (since that'd be an 85%), a D, or a horrifying F in your transcript? Highly curious if anyone has had or seen this experience.",

So I\u2019d assume as long as you\u2019re close to the cutoff and have a decent overall grade you\u2019d *probably* be fine",

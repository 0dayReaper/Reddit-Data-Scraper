    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nMy name is Adam Schwartz, I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Colorado School of Mines (CSM). My senior design team \u201cPeak Load\u201d is 14 engineering students and professional engineers taking on one of the most ambitious Capstone design projects in Mines history. Our team is called \"Peak Load\" and we will hand-build a world-class desert racing automobile at the bleeding edge of electric vehicle technology. As a group we will implement AutoCAD, advanced machining, and a wealth of knowledge to re-design the suspension and install an electric drive train. We will be entering our project into the E-class of the international Baja 1000. This mission is part of CSM\u2019s senior design capstone project and will be entered in the school's competition. As part of CSM, we have access to the best engineering departments in the United States, if not the world. We are confident in the skills we have learnt throughout our degrees and believe we will be amongst the first to complete the E-class division of the Baja 1000.\u202f\u202f    \n\nThe Baja 1000 has been around since Halloween of 1967. It is an annual off-road motorsport race held on the Baja California Peninsula, and it is the most dangerous race in North America. Teams from around the world attend this race to test the absolute limit of automobile's physical capabilities and the breaking point of human technical performance. The race vehicles include motorcycles, quads, and numerous classes of cars including Baja Bugs, Trophy Trucks, Baja Challenge cars and UTV's. Not only is the terrain treacherous, but locals create additional manufactured obstacles to take this race to the next level. They are notoriously known for booby trapping the racetrack, digging hidden trenches, redirecting rivers, and building pits to swallow trophy trucks. The E-class (electric) is new to the Baja 1000 and very few have even attempted using a 100% electric powered vehicle. Most participants are professionals that have been given stupendous budgets from their sponsors, but we are the only school to ever compete in the Baja 1000. Our team, being student led and converting an already gas-powered vehicle to electric, make us frontrunners to make history coming this November. \n\nWe are currently sponsored by some of the biggest names in off-roading, such as Fox Factory (previous winner of the Baja 1000), Ride Hard America, AEM Performance Electronics, and more. Our project reaches hundreds of thousands of people and raises awareness for our project and sponsors associated with the project.  \n\nFurthermore, we have a non-profit through Colorado School of Mines. This means that all donations (including parts) can be used as 100% tax-deductible tax write-offs.  \n\nIf you are interested in learning more, please DM me. We are currently looking for battery sponsors. Thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7sz7ij71iax81.png?width=1106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2c962af8f64772c714e118b5027fc7f596035945",

I have been a judge at the senior design trade fair for the last several years, and I love seeing how much improvement year after year there is in the program as a whole. In the late 00s, the senior design program was a joke.",

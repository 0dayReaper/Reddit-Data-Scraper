            "comment": "Hi there, former Weaver resident here back in freshman year! First of all, I think you made a great choice as I loved Weaver and thought it was an excellent place to live! \n\nAs far as maximizing space goes, both my roommate and I for a time had our beds up high enough such that our desks and a couple of other things (mini fridge for example) could fit underneath them without taking up extra space. I would HIGHLY recommend doing this as it really opens up the rest of the room and helps it to not feel so cramped. Other than that, try your best to keep most of the looser items in the closet area in order to reduce clutter in the room. Won\u2019t make a huge difference like the beds but it definitely plays a part in helping to open up the space. Other than that, there\u2019s not much to it! \n\nOutside of just your room, Weaver is an amazing place to meet people, so USE THE COMMON AREAS! Talk, be social (I know it can be hard at Mines) but there\u2019s always someone cool to get to know better! Spend time outside, enjoy the beautiful Colorado weather and get involved with any and all clubs that pique your interest. Also last thing, Weaver does have a kitchen on the first floor so absolutely make use of that if you like to cook/bake in your free time. \n\nThat\u2019s pretty much it! Have so much fun, Mines is a special place and you should be proud of your achievement!",

Also, finding a good study space outside your room (ie the main rooms at the bottom of each floor, or just going to Brown) is good because otherwise it can get cramped in there.",

I had a great time my freshman year because we would all go out and do stuff together, but I know this isn\u2019t the case for many weavites. The girls across the hall hated each other and I know a few either dropped out or moved dorms because of it. Weaver is kind of weird because it ends up feeling like you have 7 roommates because of how much time you spend in the common area so it\u2019s a really good idea to be friendly and sociable.",

            "comment": "I would really recommend bringing as little stuff as possible, and asking your roommate to do the same. I got stuck in one of the E rooms, which felt like one of the smaller ones. We both brought too many things, and barely had room to walk through the room. My roommate also brought a whole chair, one of those round cozy ones, and it became a spot to pile shit and it just got in the way. In some rooms there's a shelf above the closet, it helped me to have a bin up there for extra stuff I wasn't immediately using that month (like winter coats during the summer).  \nYou end up being so busy doing college things that you really don't need all the stuff you think you do.  \nMaybe talk to your suitemates ahead of time to see if they're down with storing bathroom items in the bathroom, or if they'll be keeping them in their own rooms. It helps saves space, but also will screw you over if someone is hogging the bathroom with all your stuff in it and you need to get ready for the day.  \nThe common areas have a fair amount of room for storage, I've seen folks set up a shelf out there to help hold things, especially if they brought like board games or a tv they don't mind sharing. You could even ask if your suitemates mind a mini fridge being out there to save space in your room.",

            "comment": "I got my MS in mechanical more than a decade ago. Granted, the Recession was in full swing and jobs weren't to be found, so I chose to stay in school. \n\nHaving the masters has not provided me any benefit in my career. Except, I was able to take the PE a year sooner. I learned some cool, higher level science/engineering, but i hated my life for two years. It was not rewarding. I've not used any of that knowledge in my career, and it's not been considered as a leg up in any position I've gone after. \n\nNow, if I wanted to stay in academia or research, it might have been worth it. This isn't necessarily related to getting the degree at mines, just that I think for most engineers, a graduate degree is a waste of money and time.",

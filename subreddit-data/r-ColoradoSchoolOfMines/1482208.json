            "comment": "I dont have any pictures, but maple is a pretty good size. Size really depends on room type though. The singles are nice. The doubles and true triples are also good. The forced triples are a bit tighter but are pretty good for being a forced triple. \n\nForced triples are doubles turned in triples because there's not enough rooms at mines. \n\nMy biggest reccomendation would be stay away from Weaver if you care about having decent sized room. The common space doesn't make up for the tiny rooms whatsoever.",

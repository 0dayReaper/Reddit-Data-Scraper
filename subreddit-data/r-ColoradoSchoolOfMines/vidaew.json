    "postText": "Hello! I am currently looking for new tutoring clients! In the age of the internet there are online resources of all kinds for every course, however, are those resources really going to sit down with you and work through a problem set making sure that you understand the material every step of the way? I don't think so. I am extremely passionate in chemistry as well as biology and would be more than happy to help you on your journey in really, truly understanding the material and succeeding in your summer classes. \n\nDetails: I charge 20$/hour and I am competent in biology, chemistry, as well as biochemistry courses. I can do in person or online tutoring. Please send me a PM if you're interested!",

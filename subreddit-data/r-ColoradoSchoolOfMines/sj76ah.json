Our candidate pool is open for a few more days.",

HEC-RAS in particular gets named a lot, and I get the impression they don't see many people who know it well.\n\nIn case it helps anyone, when I was new to career fairs, I thought that if they had your resume and seemed excited they'd get back to you, which probably contributed to my never hearing back.  You actually still need to follow up.  Now (after the usual intro stuff) I ask about what they want from an applicant that wouldn't be on the job posting and use that to more closely tailor my cover letter.",

            "comment": "I thought I wouldn't get any luck this year either because no one really wanted me for an internship as a sophomore or junior. As a senior looking for a full time position however, I not only have I had an interview, but less than 6 hours later they wanted to proceed with an offer. I also have another company wanting to initiate an interview. One thing that helped me out was experience speaking with employers in previous years because it helped me work on presenting myself and speak well under pressure.",

Most companies just showed up because their competition was there. All the companies told students to apply on the website. The employees working the booths often had no idea if they actually had job openings available. Interviews were easy to come by, but many companies would ghost interviewees. There weren't many success stories from my peers during those times. \n\nI fully acknowledge that I graduated during the Recession, but the Career Center was not helpful.  Sure, they were able to get me access to several companies at once. Beyond that, they were not helpful. \n\n Sidenote: The career center has always made bold claims about their job placement rates, but they included graduate school placement in their stats.",

I\u2019ve seen other people saying their physics classes and professors are garbage, with professors who don\u2019t even know the material (although this seems focused on introductory physics courses?)\n\nCould any physics engineering majors tell me what their experience has been with the department from start to finish? Is physics at mines great, or something to avoid?",

            "comment": "First - I might be biased but yes, it is the best in the school.\n\nSecond - Phys 1&amp;2 are not indicative of the entire department, most complaints against the department are from those two classes as there are huge class sizes and everyone at the school is required to take them.\n\nI would say we have incredible faculty. We have a great student to faculty ratio so you can start to get to know the professors by the second half of your sophomore year. We only have 50-60 majors in each class, meaning our department is small and you get to know your peers. Our curriculum is hard, but not punishing and we have an excellent mix of hands-on and theoretical coursework.\n\n If you really want a good run-down of the Phys department I would recommend you email Dr. Kuo, a teaching professor in the department.\n\nEdit: I'm a junior currently and so far it's been great. I know the faculty teaching my classes over the next year and they are excellent at their job.",

What I would warn against is having a BS in physics by itself. It is not typically valued in the work force as a standalone. \n\nAlso, if you are considering taking the FE and going the PE route as a career choice, I would shy away. At least a decade ago it was commonly held that the eng phys program did not focus on engineering as well to prepare fully for that exam. Others may have a different experience.",

            "comment": "I can honestly say my decision to do physics for my undergrad is one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made. The department was amazing. \n\nOne example I share a lot is when a friend and I were working late one night on our homework. We were really stuck, and even though it was almost 11:00pm we decided to see if our professor was still around. We went up to his office, and he wasn\u2019t there. However, the professor in the office next door was and saw us. He asked what we were doing, and immediately invited us into his office to help us thru our problem. That kind of genuine desire to help students learn was amazingly common in the department. Sure, I can\u2019t say that every professor I had in physics was perfect, but I can honestly say that 6 of the 10 best teachers I\u2019ve ever had were in the physics department, including a definite number 1. And the professor that helped us that night isn\u2019t even in that list. \n\nI also really enjoyed the culture in the department. By the time I graduated I felt like I genuinely knew every person in my class, and we all were at least casually friends. That was even true for a lot of people from the classes above and below mine. It really felt like we were all in it together. \n\nI do agree with some other comments that having only a BS in physics can make yourself hard to sell to employers. Trust me, it isn\u2019t that you aren\u2019t capable of excelling at a variety of rolls, it is that industry doesn\u2019t understand that. I did the EE combined masters program and really enjoyed it. \n\nPhysics was a lot of work, but it was 100% worth it. I would highly recommend it if you are interested in the subject matter and willing to commit.\n\nEdit: Ok, this got me thinking about all this and I dropped it from 7/10 to 6/10. Forgot about one of my EE professors from grad school. Honestly, I\u2019ve just been lucky enough that it\u2019s hard to narrow down to a top 10.",

It definitely is a ton of work but it's been well worth it so far. \n\nOne of the biggest complaints is the phys 1-2 classes. Mostly they're weed-out type classes made specifically to be difficult so don't worry if you have to retake them. They are some of the worse classes I've taken so far but honestly they weren't that bad.  \n\nIt's really cool because the dept isn't that big, so I already know a lot of my fellow students. It's really a fun place. Summer session is also a high point from past students. I'm taking it this summer so we'll see but I'm really excited.",

I'm a sophomore currently (Junior by credits) and all of the faculty I have worked with and have classes with are phenomenal. Also due to there being about 60 physics majors in each class, you get to know all of your peers which helps a lot when doing homework. I definitely recommend it!",

They still use mid 90's tech that can't even really handle an entire studio on it at the same time.\n\nI haven't really heard anything past that, but I also don't know any engineering physics majors. If its as good as others here have said, you will actually be in a much better place compared to other majors. \n\nOn the other hand, after seeing how the department has handled physics 1&amp;2 for the last several years, it doesn't give me high hopes for the rest. But I've also had horrendous professors teaching their \"good\" class. Hard to reconcile when they spew off bad information.",

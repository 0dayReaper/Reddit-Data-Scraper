I\u2019m 3rd year ALC and am currently in the car with 4 other ALC people 10 hrs into a 15 hour drive back from spending a week dirt bag climbing, skiing , and mountaineering (Owens River Gorge, Skiing Mammoth, and hiking Mt. Whitney) and it\u2019s the best choice I\u2019ve made in college. There\u2019s always someone doing something outdoors. The best friends I\u2019ve made in college have been because of ALC. I can\u2019t recommend it enough (also if you\u2019re an extrovert, we do have some good parties and other events).  If you like outdoors stuff, there are some of the most talented skiers, climbers, and hikers that you can learn from. The shenanigans is immaculate.",

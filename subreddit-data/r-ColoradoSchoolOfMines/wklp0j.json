If you just want one for your laptop when your working on stuff in the library or whatever, it\u2019s not worth it and is prolly more trouble than it\u2019s worth.",

Having an ethernet cable will be very nice in this situation.      \n\n\nOtherwise, you won't need one for just general internet usage on your phone around campus.",

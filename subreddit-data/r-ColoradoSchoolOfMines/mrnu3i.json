    "postText": "So I applied for a masters in September of 2020 and I've been checking my application pretty consistently but I haven't seen an acceptance or rejection update yet, should I be worried? I was hoping to see if anyone else is in the same situation I'm just starting to get anxious if I need to start looking for a job or not. Also it was the Data Science program and I'm a current student here too.",

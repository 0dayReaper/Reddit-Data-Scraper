It seems a full 50% of people I talk to in CO are like \"Why did you go to *mime* school??\", but then I have international colleagues who immediately recognize the name somehow.",

He was a mines grad and had graduated with a mining degree. He spent only 2 years doing work involving his degree before he decided he wanted to do something else. Having a degree from mines allowed him to completely swap his field of engineering because 99% of employers understand that classes at Mines are set up so that any major has exposure to almost all engineering types. After just 4 years at his next job he switched gears again now works in the aerospace industry as a senior engineer at SPACEX. 3 totally different career paths with 1 degree. \n\nCurrently at Mines now, totally worth it :)\nIt really can be difficult and you\u2019ll find yourself occasionally overwhelmed, but don\u2019t be dismayed.",

I went for Mines largely because it felt (accurately) like a place where people actually care about engineering for the sake of engineering and because it had a (correct) reputation for being challenging.  Where I transferred from, there was a very strong sense that it was ultimately all about the paycheck.  (The paycheck matters, but I didn't want to be somewhere where people were *only* in engineering for the paycheck.)  I had also been bored with the coursework and wanted more of a challenge.\n\nAs a grad student, I already knew I loved the overall environment of the place, I knew my prospective advisor, I liked the research options, and it's one of the best programs in my field.  I didn't apply to any other grad programs; wasn't worth gambling on advisors, campus culture, etc for me.",

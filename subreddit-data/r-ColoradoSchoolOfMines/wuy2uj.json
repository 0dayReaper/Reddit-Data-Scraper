Parking will almost always be insane, because everyone has to drive or they are not allowed to participate in society. It\u2019s the same reason the roads are always backed up. People have no other option.",

Based on the comment it seems RTD has never really cared for the extension, even before their finances were as bad as they are currently.\n\nThat said, in my perfect world the G Line and W Line would loop around Golden and meet at a station near campus",

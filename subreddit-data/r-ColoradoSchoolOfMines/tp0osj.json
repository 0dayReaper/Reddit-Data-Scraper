I know the campus has a bit more of a conservative lean than other schools in the area, but the vast majority of people are kind, helpful, and accepting in my experience.\n\nI have yet to meet anyone who I think avoided helping people because they feel a need to protect their chances of doing well on an exam. Pretty much none of the tests are curved, and I think it\u2019s because the school is making an active effort to preserve that part of the culture.\n\nGenerally, everyone is happy to help everyone. I\u2019ve really enjoyed the community here and the culture on campus.",

I\u2019ve legit had random people walk up to me asking for help on an assignment or to work together on stuff. We\u2019re all in it together",

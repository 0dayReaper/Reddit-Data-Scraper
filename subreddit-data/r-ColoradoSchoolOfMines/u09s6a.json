            "comment": "I may be in the minority but flipped classes worked well for me because of my weird learning style. I enjoy learning stuff on my own and then going to class to \"test\" out how well I learned the material through the in-class activities. I also liked asking questions about stuff I read beforehand much to the annoyance of my classmates. For some reason it just worked out for me.",

            "comment": "I have had three variations of the flipped class style while at Mines: watch full length videos to get the material and do partner work in class (MATH 112), watch videos to cover the concept for that days part of the project (CSCI 306), and watch videos to cover the basic concept/ easy version with a full lecture to cover the multi variable/hard stuff (MATH 307). The latter two I felt worked pretty well since they were not designed to teach you as much as to increase familiarity with a concept and give everyone a chance to come with a couple of questions if they had any. It basically gave an extra 20 minutes per class to get the boring stuff out of the way. \n\nThe version that was made to fully teach you and then practice in class did not go so well for me since any questions I had I had to hold on to or go on faith that I knew what was happening until class. I also felt like it was doubling class time without the benefits of the pervious two since all class was just filling out a work sheet, but we still had to show up.\n\nOverall I feel like there are some okay ways of doing it, but would still much rather stick with either a traditional class style or maybe the MATH 307 so concepts are introduced but then learning can be interactive and not limited to a video only.",

That class drives me insane (for several reasons). I firmly believe that flipped style does not work for that class. You do not get to code much except for projects, so the class is incredibly theory heavy and it's brutal.",

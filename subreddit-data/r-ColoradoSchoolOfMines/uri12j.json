There are some food options at PT (like sushi, where you can also get gf soy sauce if you ask), but not guaranteed to be free from cross-contamination. Not sure about Zime\n\nI believe there is someone with MM that you can talk to who specializes with dietary needs about what you can or can\u2019t eat. Worth a try to reach out to them",

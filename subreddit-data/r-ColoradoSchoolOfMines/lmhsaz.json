    "postText": "Not sure if anyone here will have a good answer for me but I'm curious how the quarantine works if you test positive for Covid. I get my results back tomorrow and like 99% sure I'll be positive. I live at Mines Park. I know that I'll be quarantined in another dorm.on campus but I have quite a few questions for anyone who is willing to or can answer.\n\n1. Am I placed in a room by myself or will I be with someone else who has also tested positive?\n2. Am I able to bring my tv with me so I have something to for two weeks or is there already a tv there?\n3. Am I able to bring my xbox with me so I have a way to watch tv and movies on said tv?\n4. Is there a kitchen in the room or what am I supposed to do about eating?\n5. If I were to door dash food or soda to the room, how would I pick it up since I can't leave the room? Does one of the covid response team bring it to the room for me?\n6. I'm going to work on schoolwork when I can but as I've noticed so far the last couple days,I don't have the energy or focus to be able to sit on my phone, let alone pay attention in 400 level classes. My professors have already excused me if I test positive except for one professor that has chosen not to respond to me yet. If he never answer back, what should I do?\n7. Are there other people I'll be able to talk to at least? I'm a social person and don't do well when I can't talk to people.\n\nThanks in advance",

Am I able to bring my tv with me so I have something to for two weeks or is there already a tv there?\n\nWhen you move into your quarantine space I'm pretty you bring whatever you need, so if you need your tv then bring it along\n\n3. Am I able to bring my xbox with me so I have a way to watch tv and movies on said tv?\n\nSee above\n\n4. Is there a kitchen in the room or what am I supposed to do about eating?\n\nYou will be delivered 3 meals to your door daily\n\n5. If I were to door dash food or soda to the room, how would I pick it up since I can't leave the room? Does one of the covid response team bring it to the room for me?\n\nYou can request door dash stuff from the CRIT team, just email them and they will try to make accommodations\n\n6.

My professors have already excused me if I test positive except for one professor that has chosen not to respond to me yet. If he never answer back, what should I do?\n\nIf you test positive, the CRIT team will send an email to all of your professors that you will need extra accommodations. Obviously just work it out with your individual professors, they will likely be quite lenient\n\n7. Are there other people I'll be able to talk to at least? I'm a social person and don't do well when I can't talk to people.\n\nThis one is the sucky part. You will be required to be in your room at all times except for a daily scheduled exercise/outdoor time. Not trying to scare you, but I recommend joining a few discord servers and pulling out the snapchat because it could be a long 2 weeks.",

    "postText": "Hello. I am a prospective high school senior from the Northeast. I have a 95 (3.8-ish) GPA, a 1570/1600 SAT, a fairly decent amount of ECs (standard volunteering, robotics, a club sport, etc), and some APs in Science and History. I also come from a somewhat higher-middle income family. \n\nI want to ask, if it is worth it for me to come to Mines. I\u2019m considering CSM primarily because I want to major in MME. I have a deep interest in metallurgy and I want to make a career in either research or as a production engineer of some sort. I haven\u2019t got all the details nailed down (as expected) but I generally want to do something in Metallurgy after Mines. \n\nI\u2019m primarily worried about whether it would be worth it to come to Mines given the (potential) cost for me, and if the MME program at Mines is worth it. I know Mines does very well for Mining and Petroleum, but I haven\u2019t heard a lot about the MME program being recognized.",

Apply for any other scholarships you can (there probably aren\u2019t much since you\u2019re out of state but you can still apply for the general scholarship) and see what the cost ends up as. Something else to consider, Colorado is a big and growing state for tech and mining and metallurgy so going to Mines is a good way to get into Colorado if your home state isn\u2019t very big on employment opportunities. (I could be making that up or exaggerating so do your own research). But yeah, see what the cost comes out to and weigh the pros and cons.",

Your class size might be huge which is the only downside, they keep letting too many freshmen in (source: a freshman this year). Hopefully they get a little more selective this season (you\u2019d still get in, you have great stats)",

If you apply early, show interest (do the all the \u201coptional\u201d essays and try to get a visit in), and get your FAFSA stuff in on time, you have a good chance of getting merit aid (assuming your ECs are strong as well). come Jan/Feb, look into applying for the Vanguard scholars program if you\u2019re a female-identifier. it\u2019s $7,500 per year if you\u2019re out of state, iirc (on top of your initial merit and need based aid offer). as another commenter mentioned, coming in with transfer credits (AP, IB, Community College, and/or dual enrollment) can save you time and money. \n\nas for return on investment, here\u2019s the 2020-2021 career outcomes report: https://www.mines.edu/careers/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2022/01/Career-Center-Annual-Report-2020-21_R4-optimized.pdf\nand you\u2019ll also want to look at other databases, such as Payscale, which ranks Mines #7 for in state and #10 for out of state on colleges with best return on investment. \n\nbest of luck and reach out to admissions, the MME department, and/or other departments on campus that can support you (such as the multicultural engineering programs or WISEM)",

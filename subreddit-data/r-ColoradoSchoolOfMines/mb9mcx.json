No final but there was two projects: a presentation on a Game Theory and Networks paper and paper applying Game Theory to a topic of your choice. \n\nI thought the course was really interesting and he wasn't too difficult of a grader. There's no coding if that's something your looking for. Overall the material felt similar to discrete math.",

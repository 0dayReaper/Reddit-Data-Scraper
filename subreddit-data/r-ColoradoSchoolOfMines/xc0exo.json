Being completely honest making friends at the beginning of the year is a lot easier so make the friends now! You can always chill with us. \ud83d\ude02",

College is really all about how much effort you put into it id how much you get out of it.\n\nIf you talk and try your best to make friends you will have more friends than not trying at all.\n\nIf you are in any dorm talk to your roommates and connect with them, and as always clubs are accepting. Just try to schedule things with people and have fun. \n\nLet me know if you need other ideas or help on campus. School should not be too stressful.",

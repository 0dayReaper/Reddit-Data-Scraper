    "postText": "I am wondering what made some ppl here choose Mines over these other schools. My brother went to Fort Collins and he landed a great job at a UAV company and he works along side with Boulder/Mines/Fort Collins graduates. He says that the school doesn't matter, it's entirely up to the individual's strengths and resume of accomplishments. In my CC we call these schools the Big Three. \n\nWith all else being equal, I'm wondering why ppl would say Mines better for them personally. I've toured Boulder and it's a really nice campus. The engineering ambassador said that Boulder is the state's flagship engineering school and lots of employers recruit there. I've heard the same about Mines. The kids at Boulder/Mines are typically extremely smart and the resources at both schools are great, so it makes the decision super hard. I've also been to Fort Collins and couldn't tilt the scale one way or the other",

Check if it has ABET accreditation. Mines has a much smaller class size and it\u2019s a stem only university, which is neat, but they can be really stingy with transfer credits, so make sure that they transfer over well before you commit to mines if you decide to go there.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve heard Boulder gets more FAANG people at job fairs due to their national recognition, but mines is very respected in the industry as well(if not more) from companies that have heard of it, which is the vast majorities of companies within colorado(and some in Texas I believe).\n\nSincerely, a prospect engineering student who\u2019s trying to decide what school to go to as well.",

All of their engineering buildings are far away from the main campus so it's like a separate university almost. The engineering ambassador said that to get in you must have no grade no lower than a B in all of the prereqs, so the students are definitely smart. Their freshmen average GPA is a 3.9. I've also seen videos of the student projects at Fort Collins and Boulder, they're really impressive. Its just so hard to commit to the \"right school!\" I have a 3.78 at Red Rocks CC so I know all 3 are reach schools",

I personally chose Mines over Boulder because of smaller class sizes and while the Boulder campus is beautiful, I prefer the smaller campus at Mines. I feel like if it's a choice about money, go with who ever is cheaper, accounting for housing costs since Boulder is more expensive than Golden. However you'll get a great education either way, companies actively recruit out of both mines and Boulder, although Boulder might be better for aerospace-related topics if that's what you want to persue.\n\nEdit: I wanted to add that there is a large number of students at mines from RRCC and they make transferring credits easy.",

I wouldn't say Boulder is the state's flagship *engineering* school, more so the flagship *party* school. Sure, the engineering students are smart, but Mines is just less flippant. My dad and older brother both went to Boulder because they couldn't get into Mines, so that should tell you a bit about the skill floors at Boulder vs Mines",

The majority of the proffs don't have industry experience and a frightening number of them will not be willing to help you if you have questions, which you should. If you really want to come here, just know the odds will not be in your favor while in school. After you graduate other grads will be likely to hire you. They know that the majority of work places will be a much better experience than this school. In other words, you can be mistreated but you will appreciate it, as it's better than being at Mines.\n\nFrom the people I know at CU Boulder, in Engineering, they have a lot more free time and more importantly seem to actually get something out of their classes.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that Mines is not very well known outside of Colorado. You will get the occasional person that recognizes it, but not many. Outside of mining and petroleum of course. After your first job that shouldn't really matter though. For your first, CU Boulder will have the better name recognition overall.\n\nBoulder is also cheaper than Mines. If you have any other questions let me know.",

I couldn't tell you about companies back east but in my experience Mines is a well respected school here in the west, no matter where you are",

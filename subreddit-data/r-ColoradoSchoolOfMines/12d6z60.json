Computer Science is Algorithms and theory, companies want a CRUD developer and C++ debugging wizard. If you think more school will help you get a job (I am skeptical, entry level jobs shouldn't need any kind of specialized frontend or backend experience) - then a webdev bootcamp might be more up your ally. And cheaper.",

            "comment": "I finished an MS in CS at Mines and based on my experience, no.\n\nI would argue that there is a nice mix of theory and applied work in the program. What you should expect to get out of it is a deeper understanding of CS concepts and background knowledge in various applied fields such as ML or Robotics. As others have said, having the degree can help open more opportunities especially if you are going into a job where those applied courses (ML or Robotics) are useful. Do not expect to be taught technologies (i.e. specific tools that are actually used in industry). As someone else mentioned, there is an undergrad course on application development and you could take that as a grad student but don't expect much more than that single course. Not only is there a lack of grad courses on web development at Mines, learning how to use current libraries and languages probably wouldn't be taught anyways if grad level web dev courses did exist. If that is what you're after then you're probably better off teaching yourself whatever the current cool thing is in industry and highlighting personal projects on your resume rather than spending time and money on an MS degree.",

            "comment": "I am a MS CS student. Just starting out. It would seem to me that most of what Mines offers is theory-based, focusing mostly on data science (machine learning, AI) and algorithmic robotics. That being said, there are front-end development skills you will get through a MS, and you\u2019ll stand out more than you would with just a boot camp certification. \n\nEven more importantly, the MS will open doors for you that a boot camp cert won\u2019t. I\u2019m talking back-end software engineering and such. If you want the skills for front-end work as well, I\u2019d do the Master\u2019s AND learn stuff like HTML/JavaScript over the Summer. Then you have a choice of what you want to do.",

            "comment": "The value of a college (*especially* Master's) education is not necessarily that you graduate loaded up with \"hot career skills\", but rather that you have a strong theoretical base to allow you to pick up those \"hot\" skills rapidly as the tides change.\n\nBecause the tides *will* change. They always have and always will. New buzzwords will float around C-suite offices and get passed on to HR and recruiting teams. Someone that knows their fundamentals can adapt quickly to the changing tides, as they can see how the new fad is built upon a foundation of those fundamentals. You're learning a new flavor rather than a new technology.\n\nIn an interview, you mostly just need to be familiar enough with those hot topics to speak intelligently about them, not a subject matter expert. Especially for a company that's hiring fresh grads. They're likely going to be putting you on a team *with* subject matter experts, and they just need someone smart enough to learn fast and not fall behind.",

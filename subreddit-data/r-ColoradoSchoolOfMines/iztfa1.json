Compare that to Boulder where the county banned 18-22 year olds being in groups of any size, including in cars, to cut down on spread. \n\nThank you, fellow Orediggers. Very cool! \n\n[https://www.mines.edu/coronavirus/covid-19-cases/](https://www.mines.edu/coronavirus/covid-19-cases/)",

When there is spread (e.g. in other universities), it seems to happen in dorms and fraternities/sororities (see e.g. CU Boulder)--which means we'd notice it.  Honestly, given the precautions in place I wouldn't be all that worried if the person sitting nearest to me in a classroom was coughing up a storm, since it'd have to get through their mask, past two empty seats, and through my mask to infect me.",

    "postText": "I'm just finishing up this semester:\n\n- CSCI 200 (Foundational Programming Concepts and Design)\n- CSCI 303 (Intro to Data Science)\n- MATH 307 (Intro to Scientific Computing)\n- MATH 332 (Linear Algebra)\n- MATH 334 (Intro to Probability)\n- HASS 111 (NHV Short Form - let's just say I had a bad first semester here)\n\nMy grades were good enough this semester. CS200 is a known weed-out class, CSCI303 and MATH334 were both cakewalks, other three were somewhere in the middle. This is the schedule I'm considering for next semester:\n\n- MATH 300 (Foundations of Advanced Mathematics)\n- MATH 310 (Intro to Mathematical Modeling)\n- MATH 324 (Statistical Modeling)\n- MATH 335 (Intro to Mathematical Statistics)\n- CSCI 220 (Data Structures and Algorithms)\n- CSCI 403 (Database Management)\n\nI don't think this should be much harder than my current semester. I've heard 300/310 are a lot of writing, but not too difficult. I've heard 403 is a cakewalk, and I don't think any of them should be nearly as difficult as 200. \n\nThoughts?",

I've heard the new data structures is pretty difficult, but I don't know from experience since I took it before they changed it. I think it's a reasonable schedule, the only reason I would be concerned is because 18 credits is a lot.",

I have Munson for both 335 and 324, and Scott Strong for 310 who I really liked with diffeq. \n\nMost of my difficulty with my current 17-credit schedule stems from CS200 and NHV since I'm not great with project time management, as long as 220 is easier than 200 I think I should be fine then.",

I think I'm going to keep it but I might have to drop something. the hardest concepts for me in 200 are classes/inheritance/templating/etc, rather than the data structures or algorithms we've discussed in 200, so maybe there's a chance I'll have an easier time with it?",

    "postText": "Hello all! I will be a first-year graduate student this fall doing the CS Bridge Program, and I'm currently looking for a place to live. I've applied to live in Mines Park, but I'm not sure when to expect to hear back, or how good my chances are. If anyone could let me know their experience with the Mines Park housing lottery, it would be greatly appreciated. \n\nIn that same vein, I'm looking for housing! I will have a car with me, so the location is rather flexible as long as it's within 10-20 minutes of campus. I'm a fairly neat and tidy guy with a pet hedgehog. I love hiking and mountain biking, and I'm also very into video games (PC and Switch). \n\nFeel free to DM me or respond to this post to get in touch about either Mines Park or a roommate opening. Thank You!",

Do you have any idea what percentage of applicants ultimately get housing in Mines Park? I'm trying to decide if I should just entirely give up on the lottery",

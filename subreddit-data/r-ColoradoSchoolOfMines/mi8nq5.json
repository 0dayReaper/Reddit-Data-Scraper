    "postText": "Hi, I'm a high school senior going to CSM this fall. Currently, I am going in as an Applied Mathematics major, but I think I want to change to geophysics/geophysical engineering. I was wondering if anyone a part of that program has more information about it. I am also a pretty shy person, so I was wondering if anybody had any suggestions for how I can connect with other students before I go in the fall and once I am at CSM. Thank you!",

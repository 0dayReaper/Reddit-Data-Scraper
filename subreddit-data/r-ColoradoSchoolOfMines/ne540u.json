It would be a shame to have taken so many thermodynamics related courses just to put myself at the will of mother nature with the temperature!",

Just stay away from the single hose floor standing units- they are very inefficient. \n\nEven better in Colorado are swamp/evaporative coolers, they work well here for a fraction of the cost of AC. You can make your own pretty easily as well.\n\nPersonally, I have found that just keeping windows open at night and closing them in the morning keeps my apartment pretty cool. I keep my shades/blinds down as well.",

Window unit ac systems are a bit less effective but I would say if you're already struggling with the heat, it would be worth it.",

They cause me so many problems, like forcing me to use a separate phone app to check, not being integrated with many 3rd party email softwares. I'm definitely exaggerating but I'm honestly really pissed that the more official-looking email we get (mines.edu, not mymail.mines.edu) is tied to Outlook instead of Google. I set up forwarding to the MyMail account because I still refuse to use the other one\n\nEdit: I was very angry when I wrote this, please see my comment",

It only stops after they changed their email password. I believe they allow you to store more emails than your email account capacity. They do this buy using POP to push emails to their server.\n\nI also recently found they use their own servers to send out emails from your email address. Recently some employees reported the emails that they sent are going into the recipients' SPAM folder and are even marked as SPAM or blocked completely. It happens even when they sent within the same organization. After some investigation, I found that these emails are being marked as SPAM because they failed the SPF. It turns out the emails are being sent by an unknown server that were not authorized. Further reverse lookup directed me to a server in NL that belonged to the company running MyMail app. It means our staff was using the app for our company email to send his emails. Instead of using our company SMTP to send the emails, the app used their own servers which caused the SPF to fail.",

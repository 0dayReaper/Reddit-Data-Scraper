    "postText": "Hi guys, I'm a prospective undergrad student interested in Mine's CS + Robotics path.\n\nFrom stalking the subreddit, it seems that CS at Mines was very bad in past years. Understaffed, few research opportunities, etc. I would like to know if that has changed. Has the CS department improved? Are the career fairs as good as they advertise? Mines vs CU Boulder CS? General thoughts about CS @ Mines.\n\nAny info would be appreciated. Hope you have a nice day.",

            "comment": "Comparing Mines and CU Boulder for CS will be a tough decision, but I will definitely take the time to visit both campuses, speak with current students, and attend information sessions before making a final decision. While student life seems to be substantially better at Boulder my sister graduated there this year and had a great experience. Parties, girls, and sporting events are way better at Boulder. I have to admit that when I was touring that campus years ago, I experienced a heavy influence of politics in the classroom setting during the Trump/Clinton election at Boulder. The school leaned heavily to the left, which in my opinion, shouldn't occur in a classroom unless it's directly related to the field of study (like Poli Sci). This wouldn't matter if it were right-leaning to me, I just don't believe it belongs in the classroom.   \nAttending Mines is more of a statement compared to Boulder. When you attend Mines, you're strictly there to study your field and be the best at it. The Career Day at our school is no joke, and I've seen many students get hired on the spot by companies that Boulder students couldn't imagine working for. The quality of people you get introduced to can have a highly impactful effect on your career and studies.  \nIn my opinion, Mines is the better long-term bet. However, I will give you a heads-up that this school is like a 9-5 job with overtime to do well. I'll be graduating this year with an M.S., and if I had to do it over again, I wouldn't change a thing. If you want to have the \"typical\" college experience, Boulder will fulfill that with no problem. Having Mines on your resume does carry weight, and people look and speak to you differently when they realize you're a Mines student. I believe Mines is the opportunity that others wish to have. At the end of the day, Boulder students will work for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck in your decision process!",

            "comment": "CS@Mines has gotten a LOT better over the past few years. A ton of resources have been pushed into the department by the school. There a lot of great professors in the department that are passionate about what they teach and their research as well. They have also redesigned the entire starting course load to be more up to date and rigorous in the teaching they do.  \n\nThere are plenty of undergrad research opportunities to take advantage of, I did research over the same summer as my field session project. \n\nSpeaking of the field session, it\u2019s basically an extended technical interview with an industry partner that you get a grade for. It\u2019s a great experience, especially if you can do it early on when you may not have an internship yet, I even got my current internship from it. \n\nMines CS ranks above Boulder on Niche for the undergrad program. Mines is also one of the best return on investment schools in the country. \n\nTake advantage of all of the CS programs that you can like C-MAPP, which is a scholarship funded by industry partners. Attend their events and you\u2019ll make a ton of great industry connections. In general, CS@Mines holds a lot of mixer-type events where you can talk to alums or just industry partners that come to Mines for the events and make great connections.\n\nI am currently in the robotics track going into all of my senior classes before I go to grad school with the combined masters program here and I have loved it. If you continue on the track you\u2019ll eventually take Robot Ethics with Dr. Williams. He is a great professor with some amazing robotics research opportunities, definitely reach out to him if that\u2019s something you\u2019re interested in.",

Just work hard and be willing to learn on the job. Most of the skills you use at work are not learned in school. Half the battle is just being a good communicator and a decent person to work with. That will get you further than you think.!",

For myself, when I could do that, I'd excel, otherwise it was dropping the class and retaking the next semester. (Took 5 yrs to finish with a 9 month internship thrown in the mix) \n\nNot sure if I buy the whole 'tougher school is better' mentality, because teams in industry need all sorts of minds and backgrounds to get products and services out the door and into the hands of customers. \n\nWe need more engineers and less bean counters in charge.   The world would be a better place \nLook at Intel as a prime example! \n\nTwo of my favorite quotes from Dr. Bill Parkhurst \n\n\"Acknowledge, move on.\"   \n \n\"Preservere, Understanding will come later\" \n\nYou got this, seriously and if you pivot to a career that is non-technical, you'll still have a serious leg up over others with that 2.4 from Mines!",

To the point where I didn\u2019t start applying for career jobs and drifted working odd low skill work for a few years. 3 years after graduating I started applying and got a job within 6 months.\n\nGuess what - I am a perfectly good engineer and worker. I\u2019ve moved up in my career normally and have *almost* stopped feeling like an imposter who\u2019s about to be found out.\n\nETA - it\u2019s been a decade since I graduated and I am 7 years into my career.",

            "comment": "College, particularly at Mines, is a self-esteem destroyer. It doesn't matter whether you have a 2.4 GPA or a 4.0, the grade is not a measure of your long-term success or potential. Neither does your lack of work experience. It's true that you will have a harder term in the near future getting the \"high-end\" position like Lockheed or whatever, but that's not representative of your overall career. Get a smaller position that excites you, something that can boost your esteem, and use that as a jumping-off point for the rest of your life. The last 2 years have been some of the hardest years of my life, and seeing from your post I can see I'm not alone. I am also going to graduate soon, and I have squandered both academic and social opportunities to the point where I likely won't have anything to show for my college years. However, I have seen myself at my worst and I am motivated to move forward and have a successful future. I will graduate at the end of the day, and that's all that matters long-term. So don't get so caught up in the moment, and realize that you are NOT ALONE in the way you feel. COVID was an incredibly damaging period of time, but college can be a bubble that doesn't have to affect your future. Move on from Mines, and take your life one step at a time and you'll learn to be proud of what you achieve.\n\nSincerely,\n\nOne struggler to another",

You learn everything you need to know when you start the job. \n\nI had a 2.8 gpa and what people told me was, don't put your gpa on your resume if it's under 3. So just make a good resume, with \"bachelors of science, geological engineering\" or whatever. No gpa needed. Put down some skills even if you didn't become great at them, just put them down. You'll be surprised, once you start a job it's pretty dang easy and the company wants you to succeed so they'll help you. Jobs are 10x more supportive than school teachers or even classmates. They basically hold your hand until you can do the thing well enough on your own.",

Get that first job, gain some experience, and with the right attitude you'll go as far as you want to push yourself. Work is much different than the classroom.\n\nTake it from me, someone who failed out of undergrad, worked 40 hours a week and went to community college. Got back into the same program I failed out of, and finished with a strong major GPA, but a low overall. Some jobs I interviewed for wouldn't give me the time of day due to the GPA, but many would. I started the first two years of my career as an engineering technician, getting to do a lot of hands on work and some design work. Once that experience was there no one cared about GPA anymore. 6 years into my career I returned to Mines for a MS in Materials part time, while working full time and couldn't be happier with that decision. Not trying to boast or anything, but just telling you life isn't some straightforward path for everyone. You may feel really down right now, and trust me I understand that better than most. You'll realize quickly in the real world, most people don't know that much and you can quickly carve out a niche and bring a lot of value to the table. Try to be proud of what you've done so far and look forward to whatever adventures may lie ahead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeep your head up.",

What matters is making it out of Mines alive and fighting through. My GPA went from a 3.8 to a 3.4 because of field and I was crushed. Yet, it rarely comes to mind anymore, and I have gotten past it. \n\nDon't worry, buddy, you're not a failure at life.",

The thing is people like me who are triple vaccinated will probably end up getting COVID. I can definitely accept that. What I can't accept is the students that aren't worried at all and aren't taking precautions. This could lead to me coming home with COVID and unintentionally getting my 85 yr old grandma sick and in the hospital. And I'm not the only student who has loved ones in the high risk category.",

Also no one seems to be talking about long COVID. Imagine debilitating fatigue for months of your life \u2014 goodbye college! Imagine never tasting or smelling again. This is not about oh 1-2 weeks of getting sick. Everyone has an obligation, including the school, to help protect the health of everyone else. Preferring in-person classes is not reason enough for you to potentially spread something that could kill a loved one, a stranger, OR ruin their lives long-term. You might not be worried, but others are. You\u2019re only as fast as the slowest person in the group. Mines should have gone remote, and it\u2019s despicable that they havent. \n\nAlso, isolate for more than 5 days. The CDC literally shortened the recommendation to appease corporate interest, it\u2019s not in the interest of any one\u2019s health or safety.",

I really believe we should have at least taken the first 2 weeks after break to stay remote. Till then I'm personally double masking, carrying around hand sanitizer, and keeping to myself. \n\nAlso the idea that everyone has an obligation to each other to stay safe is something I agree heavily with. Just because you have 3 boosters doesn't mean that everyone else has that protection. \n\nHopefully we all can stay safe while we're in person and can get proper protection against COVID.",

It's not optimal for anyone when everyone has to take a week off for isolation. Think of it like the flu. You don't *want* to get the flu, right? People generally accept that if you get the flu, you shouldn't go to work/school for about a week thereafter, right? Well, we know a butt-load of students are going to get sick and have to go remote for about a week, probably the instructors as well. Why not hard-code remote classes into the first two weeks? It's not hard to do, and would honestly be less disruptive than leaving it to the profs to deal with each Covid case on a case-by-case basis. \n\nSo yeah, most students will get it, most students will be fine, but I'm disappointed the school actively decided against everyone's best interest -including their own- despite the incredibly low opportunity cost of being safe in the middle of a hypercontagious wave in the middle of travel season in the middle of a pandemic.",

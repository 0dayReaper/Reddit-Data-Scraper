    "postText": "Howdy all, my roommate and I are looking for a third to join us. New lease starts June 1. Our place is a two-floor townhouse 15mins away from campus. Room upstairs, desk/study area downstairs. We are generally clean people, so looking for someone of the same mentality. Great landlord too :) the place is in excellent condition and things are fixed very quickly. DM if interested!",

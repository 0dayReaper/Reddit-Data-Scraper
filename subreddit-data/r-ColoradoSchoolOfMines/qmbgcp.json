    "postText": "I'm planning to take it in the spring to support my thesis work, but I've only taken one CS class ever and none at Mines.  So I have two questions (both somewhat generalizable to the CS department as such):\n\n1. How important/intensive is the Data Structures prerequisite (or how important does it tend to be)?\n   * I haven't taken DS, but I'm a reasonably proficient programmer.  Am I going to need to have a rock-solid understanding of all the data structures stuff or can I get away with figuring it out on the fly?  (I do plan to brush up on basic data structures over winter break.)\n2. How intensive is 575 or how intensive do grad-level CS courses tend to be?\n   * For context, I write a lot of code for work, but I don't have much exposure to CS proper (algorithms and such).",

            "comment": "I took CSCI 475 (same lectures, different classwork) without Data Structures, it was doable. Pretty sure the 575 students work was more intense, though (they had a solo project vs a group project, plus a longer presentation and paper at the end of the semester). \nGrad students are allowed to take a couple 400 level classes for credit, if you have that option I might suggest doing 475? You get a good background in Machine Learning that way, and still get some credit. \nEither way I suggest being pretty well versed in python and pandas data structures. When I took it it was all done in Jupyter notebooks and we were using pandas nonstop.",

            "comment": "I'm a little late, but here are my thoughts (for context, I took it Spring 2021 when it was asynchronous): \n\n1. DS is universal in all upper level CS classes, so they show up in this class as expected. However, in my opinion, not taking DS beforehand isn't much of a big deal. You could probably manage learning on the fly, and, assuming the class is somewhat the same, there's only one programming project (at the very end).\n2. 575 is the only grad level class I've ever taken so I wouldn't know any comparisons. I took 404 (AI) at the same time and felt that class was more work than 575 so go figure.",

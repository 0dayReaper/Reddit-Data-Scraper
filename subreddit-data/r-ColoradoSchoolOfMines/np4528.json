    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI was wondering if Mines has dedicated groups/clubs to play/discuss board games like Catan, DnD and card games like Yu-Gi-Oh. Maybe even a dedicated Facebook group for Super Smash Bro tournaments? My undergrad college did and they had a group on Facebook to coordinate tournament times and book campus spaces. So I was wondering if Mines has something similar or if you guys could guide to some local groups in Golden or Denver that are centered around those interests.\n\nThanks in advance!",

For Smash Bros Ultimate, there is a much broader appeal, so the Residence Life folks will usually put on one or two bigger tournaments a year for charity.",

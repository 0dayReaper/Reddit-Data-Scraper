    "postText": "I'm moving into the Trad Halls here at Mines after summer ends, and I wanted to bring some of my figures/model kits to display. I wanted to put them up on something other than my desk, preferably some shelves I could hang on the walls. Anyone have advice about putting shelving on the walls (and if it's even allowed at Mines) or with experience with this in general? Would it be better to just leave that stuff at home?",

Not saying things would be stolen, but the trads have no AC so you better be okay with your figs being in 100+ degree weather. You will also have to clean out between semesters so its probably best to wait till you are settled in an apartment your sophomore-senior year to set up figs.\n\nOnce your ready, i recommend getting detolf glass cabinets as they are really good and worth the money.",

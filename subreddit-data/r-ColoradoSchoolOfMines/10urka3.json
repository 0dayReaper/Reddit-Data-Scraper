    "postText": "Good Afternoon Colorado people!\n\nI am a student at the CCD hygiene school in Denver and am desperately in need of patients who regularly have 6 month appointments to do cleanings on.\n\nPlease see poster below. This current semester patients are needed! Please give the number below a call or text below on the poster to make an appointment!\n\nThese cleanings and x-rays are at a very discounted price (insurances not accepted only medicaid)\n\nKids are also a requirement for this semester and their appointments are shorter without screenings needed, please!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fk1o2nrojgga1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1832b01dd9e61585b7a81643d08db36f0ba7fb28",

    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman that has decided to go into the Thorson first year honors program, and I can't decide whether or not to sign up for the associated themed learning community. The description of the Explore Honors Community sounds all well and good, but I can't find any mention of the experience it provides except for on the themed learning communities page on the official Mines website. \n\nI don't want to cordon myself off from everyone but the Thorson students, but the description of the community makes it seem like a jolly good time. Does anyone have any experience in this situation that could help a new Oredigger out?",

Personally, I've met like half of my friends at mines from dorms and the other half from classes and clubs. A TLC is just another way that people try to build a community at mines, so there's no real pro/cons aside from where you want to start your friend group, you'd have to try to  limit it with just your floor.",

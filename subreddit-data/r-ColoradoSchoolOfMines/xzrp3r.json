It really helps to have a one-on-one with your professor.\n\nIf that doesn't work, talk to people. Even if you don't know anyone in your class, just ask people if they've made study groups and ask to join. \n\nKeep strong dude! The first semester of Mines can be rough. I was in a similar position a few years back and I can totally empathize.",

Maybe I\u2019m too sensitive but I definitely didn\u2019t feel support from the professor or TA. I\u2019ll try to find some fellow students to try to work with this week.",

Hopefully it works out with fellow students, you could try the casa tutoring because they're different from the professors and class TAs. Also if you are in any clubs you could ask folks there for help, or even your RA.",

If you have availability.. and are okay with trying again, try going to different office hours since we rotate every hour, sometimes it\u2019s a hit or miss, unfortunately, but there\u2019s lots of options and I really hope you are able to get the help you need.",

I'm going into my final year of undergrad and I can promise you that I've been there, most of us have.   I had a 4.0 in hs and now I have a 2.6 (and that's okay!). My recommendation would be to email your professors and TA's for the classes you're struggling in and let them know that you're struggling but you want to learn the material. One on one office hours with your professors is great! It's hard to ask questions that you feel may be \"dumb\" in class when you're surrounded by your peers but it's easier when it's just your prof or TA.  I promise that most professors want you to succeed and will help you get there.  I spent plenty of nights in my dorm wondering if I was too dumb for this school but I promise that you'll get through it. \n\nI may not be able to help you with your academics but feel free to reach out and I can help you get the help you need.  I wish you well!",

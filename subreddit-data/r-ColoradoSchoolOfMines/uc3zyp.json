When you have a support system, it makes it a much more enjoyable and easier experience, even if they aren\u2019t the same major as you. I guarantee that most people who hate this school aren\u2019t very social, it\u2019s a tough school but not impossible, and can even be fun. I say this as someone who has spent all four years here and is about to graduate",

People who are content with their experience don't yell about it on the Internet.\n\nPersonally, I like Mines so much I voluntarily stayed for grad school (I had a job offer and don't need an MS for my career).  I don't make posts about how I have interesting, challenging (in a good way) coursework and typically put in 40-hour weeks.",

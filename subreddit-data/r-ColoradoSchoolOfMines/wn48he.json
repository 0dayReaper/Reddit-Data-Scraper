    "postText": "So I, and incoming freshman, have a move in time of 2:00 PM. I also was unable to get tickets in time for my parents to attend the convocation ceremony. I don't necessarily want to rush to unpack all my stuff in an hour, then run off to an event my parents can't attend. I know that it is being livestreamed and my parents and I do not care. Is this event mandatory for me to attend or can I just skip it?\n\nTLDR: Is convocation mandatory for new students?",

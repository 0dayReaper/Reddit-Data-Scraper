    "postText": "Colorado School of Mines has partnered with Undergrad &amp; Grad Student Government and the City of Golden to launch a new campus shuttle program.\u00a0 The program will provide free shuttle service in and around campus and to popular areas near campus, including Mines Park, Jackson Street/Safeway, Downtown Golden, the RTD \u201cW\u201d Line Station, and South Golden Road.\u00a0 This service will operate on 10-minute intervals and will be a free, hop-on/hop-off service (no pass required). Accessible service will also be provided. Exact timing of the launch of the new campus shuttle program is dependent upon the acquisition of the needed vehicles to provide the service. This service is expected to launch prior to the Fall 2024 semester but could be in place late Spring semester 2023.\u00a0 Stay tuned for further details and announcements on this exciting program!\n\nhttps://www.mines.edu/parking/campus-parking-and-transit-enhancements/\n\nSuper exciting news! Now they just need to get the W-Line up and running again. Golden is pretty isolated from Denver and RTD as a whole and this is a great step in the right direction.",

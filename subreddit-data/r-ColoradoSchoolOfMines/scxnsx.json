    "postText": "Hey guys, I\u2019m a senior in a high school with plans to become an engineer. A few months ago I made it into mines with a scholarship and I toured the campus. Colorado and the town of Golden are such comforting places. I currently live in Texas and have been living here for almost all my life, but I\u2019ve always loved Colorado. The campus itself was really comfortable and easy to traverse. I do like the campus a lot and I\u2019m stuck at making a decision. I also made it into Texas A&amp;M which has a good engineering school. My entire family pretty much went to A&amp;M and I\u2019m so familiar with the school. The social setting there is so much more massive and louder than it is at mines and that is both good and bad. Personally I\u2019m a mix between an extrovert and introvert I can\u2019t decide between a smaller, comfortable , and less familiar setting or a massive, personal, and familiar setting. Any tips on making a decision?",

            "comment": "Well, mines' social atmosphere is much much much much more subdued than A&amp;M. Mines is also extremely difficult (I don't know in comparison to A&amp;M). \n\nI think you should look at some more data points than size and location. Look into the major specific programs you're interested in or want to do. Starting salaries for graduates in each. Look into clubs that you think you might like and see what each school has and doesnt.\n\nI can tell you that I personally adore CO, though my opinion is skewed because I am a native, and I love to ski and ride mountain bikes.",

Someone would be very willing to help you out and take you around their department to labs and classrooms!  Texas A&amp;M is an excellent school, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll miss out if you chose one over the other.  Best of luck on your search!",

My roommate transferred back to A&amp;M after the 1st semester of freshman yr at Mines. But that was back in 1991 :) Student support services at Mines is much better now, both mental and academic.",

            "comment": "Hey there! I'm actually an A&amp;M grad and am now at Mines for a different degree (long story).\n\nI love Mines. I love the community, I love the size of the campus, I love the town.\n\nThere's a huge difference in atmosphere between the two. As you know, A&amp;M is HUGE. When I was there I never really felt comfortable and felt insignificant. I had a very stereotypical weed out class my first semester and the professor let everyone know that it was. That's just me though. I think A&amp;M just wasn't the best fit for me in the long run and when engineering got hard, it was easy to drop it and change to another major. I was also interested in the military and was in the Corps of Cadets, which is another reason I chose to go. That may have had an impact on my experience there. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAt Mines the student to faculty ratio is a bit smaller, at least in upper division courses. I feel comfortable approaching professors and enjoy the smaller atmosphere. Its not perfect, for sure, but really no campus is. \n\nIt's really your preference, but I'm happy to answer any questions about my experience at A&amp;M and Mines.",

Plus CO tends to be one of the more expensive places to live in. \n\nAlso, if you are planning to do mechanical engineering don't do Mines. The department is horrible and only has a very small numbers that have any real experience. \n\nI would only recommend Mines if you know you want to do Mining engineering or Petroleum. But if you're thinking Petroleum you might want to look deeper into the field first.\n\nThe Chemical engineering and chemistry departments are nothing special and computer science is a mess as well.",

As well as giving completely incorrect information. In what was supposed to be their best class. There have also been multiple times where the proffs had no idea what was going on and handed everything off to the TA who would refuse to actually do anything useful.\n\nThis school should be better for its price. If the proffs are incapable why are they here?\n\nWhy do you like it?",

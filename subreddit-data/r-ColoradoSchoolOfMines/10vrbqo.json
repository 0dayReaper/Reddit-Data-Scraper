Both CS Mines and UTSA seem to offer bridge courses. Which one would be better for an MS CS - based on aspects like value of the program, Internships/co-ops, companies hiring, etc?",

It is cheaper to attend, so take that as you may. As for mines I know lots of companies take special interest in hiring from mines, we have lots of good connections to good CS companies and tend to have a good reputation. The downside is ofc it\u2019s more expensive.",

Even so, Mines does carry a bit more weight than UTSA. That said, UT Dallas is better for compsci than UTSA. Take what you want from that last bit of info.",

Lots of other people have pointed out some good things to consider but here's my two cents:\n\nI didn't do the bridge program but I've met several CS students that have. They all seemed to be satisfied with the progress and I think the program has a good success rate. Depending on your background, there is a steep learning curve. Some folks complain about how hard some of the courses are (namely algorithms and theory of computation) but people who have a background in CS also complain about these courses. I believe that the students in the bridge program go through it as a cohort, so there seems to be pretty good comradery among them.",

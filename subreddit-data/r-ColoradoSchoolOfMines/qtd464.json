    "postText": "I am taking a lighter load next semester, so instead of both I will only be taking one. I'll probably take the more difficult one just to get it out of the way but I'm still undecided. Any info or experiences would be appreciated \n\nThe professors for Heat &amp; Mass Transfer are Chauhan and Gardner and the professors for Separations are Carreon, Wu, and Barankin",

Separations had more complex concepts but H&amp;M was just tons of assignments, homework, projects, etc. \n\nAlso, if possible I would wait until separations is taught by Professor Morrish again. She\u2019s one of the best professors I\u2019ve taken at Mines. Made seps a million times easier than it would\u2019ve been with Barankin.",

Both of those classes are only offered once per academic year (spring semester), and they are prerequisites for a lot (all?) of the classes you would then normally end up taking the following fall.

I\u2019m considering it as a class next semester and wanted to see if anyone had any insight into how much the workload is/if it\u2019s a worthwhile class to take. (I\u2019d mostly be taking it bc it sounds interesting and I don\u2019t have anything better to put into my schedule)",

I also ended up working in nano science for whatever that's worth, so it ended up paying off more than I expected it to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n The workload was light-moderate: the easiest chem class I took during my undergrad but still harder than some of my other electives. Can't speak for other profs though.",

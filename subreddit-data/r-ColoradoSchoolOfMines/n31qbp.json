    "postText": " I was wondering why my Residence hall\u2019s application on mines.starrezhousing has the status of \u201capplication pending\u201d. I submitted the application multiple times to be safe and it keeps saying that. Was it not completed because everything was filled out? Is my application to TLC still valid because it would suck if they never got it since yesterday was the deadline.",

I know they are trying new things with the TLC applications this year by combining it with starrez so that might be causing the issue.",

            "comment": "When I applied for mines park my application said something similar. Still received an email a week later with a housing offer. But mines res life is totally hit or miss, they haven\u2019t told me anything about summer 1 housing which starts in nearly 2 weeks and I\u2019ve called every day for the past week and no communication from anyone.\n\nAt this point I\u2019ll probably request a refund for the app fee and look off campus, idk. Had a similar experience when applying for sophomore housing, i never got an offer and had to contact reslife just to find out everything was taken.\n\nBasically if you applied for summer housing I\u2019d consider it a lost cause unless you\u2019re ok with extremely last minute notice. I\u2019ve spoken to at least 3 different people on separate occasions who all claimed they would \u201csend an email and follow up\u201d but my inbox is empty. Silence.",

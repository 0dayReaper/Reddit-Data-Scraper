    "postText": "I was going through the curriculum of the MS CS program [here](https://catalog.mines.edu/graduate/programs/cs/#coursestext). The curriculum seems a bit peculiar as compared to that of other universities. I cannot see general CS courses being offered here and there seems to be a greater emphasis on robotics courses.\n\nI am not from a CS background so I will need a program that also teaches me the fundamentals. It seems the MS CS program at CS-Mines is not designed for that.\n\nAny current students of MS CS here? What are your opinions?",

It's just that the first few listed are robotics.",

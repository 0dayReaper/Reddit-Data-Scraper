    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently got accepted to Mines and (barring some other pending results) there is a good chance I attend. I am planning to major in Chemical Engineering but I am still undecided, so I know my course schedule will be difficult. \n\nDespite all of my enthusiasm, I have been taking a good look at this sub and I am a little discouraged by how hard Mines is advertised as. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I know I will have to work hard to get a degree. But the overall attitude seems to be much worse compared to other schools I applied to. I already have two years of experience in dual-enrollment, so I already have some experience in Community College, but I don\u2019t know if even that will be enough to prepare me.\n\nAnother question I want to know is how much Calculus will I need to know for my first year/courses? I haven\u2019t been in a Pre-Calc course in two years (in Calc II at the Community College now) so I\u2019m not sure what to expect.\n\nI really don\u2019t mean to be a bother, but I want to know what your experiences were with these things. Also, sorry about any grammar errors I made. It is late and I\u2019m tired \ud83d\ude02",

If you tend to easily find your communities, that shouldn't be a problem. What I will say is that, as far as I've heard, chemical engineering is the hardest major here, but you seem to be well ahead in classes so that might be just right for you.",

They all explained how versatile the major was, and it proved to be true as they were all in wildly different careers (finance, pharmaceuticals, environmental, etc). I am still not 100% sure what I want to be in life, but I am incredibly interested in each career that has stemmed from the degree. The options and versatility are a huge selling point.",

ChemE is NOT chemistry, its much more \"process engineering\" with some chemical reactions mixed in.\n\nI would recommend getting a minor in Computer Science wherever you go to school, as that will open the rest of the doors that ChemE doesn't. Whatever career you end up in - being able to write a python or VBA script to automate most of your job is super valuable, so you can't go wrong with some CS.\n\nAlso - Calc doesn't really come back around in ChemE till your 2nd semester junior year and on. By then everyone has forgotten everything and you all re-learn it together. You'll be fine, no one remembers all their past courses - everyone is re-learning whats needed as they go.",

I've done dual enrollment and was a transfer student, and Mines coursework was significantly more challenging than either.  That said, I didn't find that they artificially made it harder than it had to be--they just didn't make any effort to make it easy.  For example, in Physics 1 and 2, you're expected to understand the calculus and be able to apply it intelligently on the fly, rather than just deriving algebra and using that.\n\nPersonally, I love it here.  The students generally actually like engineering, and it shows.  I've found the challenge to be appropriate and worthwhile.  I also like the social environment, but I'm not a partier and don't want more than a few good friends.",

You are definitely seen as a paycheck here, rather than a human or student. \n\nGeneral Chem is actually a great example of this. There are a number of the labs that require high accuracy testing in order to not fail totally. They act as if everyone knows how to perfectly do these processes after reading about them before the class. I'm not sure if that's due to an entitled outlook that people that comes to Mines should have had previous lab experience or its done out of malice. Either way its a great example of how they don't actually care to teach.\n\nAs far as calculus, it really depends on how well you grasp the concepts. If you get them well you'll do ok. Unfortunately most of the math classes are abstract without showing applications. And there will of course be filler that will never be used.",

If anything, I would go out on a limb and say that Mines has more professors who are experienced, or who have chosen to be primarily teaching professors (rather than primarily doing research).",

Thats because they are still in school. And typically speaking undergrad TA's tend to be better than grad students. I don't know why but thats the case. \n\nMines doesn't have very many with actual experience in industry. One that I've had was my favorite teacher I've ever had. He retired from industry and then came back to help out. He would both answer your questions and then ask more of you.\n\nAlso, choosing to teach all your life doesn't mean you are any good at it. One of my worst professors was one that spent her entire life teaching about 15 years if I remember correctly. She was incapable of answering questions and would deflect to her TA's. Those TA's would typically feel it was under them to answer questions as well. That was in 2 classes under the same prof and different TA's. And one of those was the profs \"best\" class according to everyone I talked to. Thankfully that prof is no longer around, and I helped to make sure she never returns. \n\nSo please tell me more about how inexperienced the professors are. Let me know about ones that are actually decent.",

This is definitely true, but for being such a \"prestigious\" institution there are many solvable problems.\n\nAttending a research engineering university that claims to be different. In fact Mines policy even states that teaching and research professors to be different roles. It was a big talking point when I was recruited that the ones teaching were there to teach, not find minions for their research. Section 4.1 if you're interested https://www.mines.edu/policy-library/academic/  The research side of Mines isn't all that bad, but that's not what i'm paying to come here for.\n\nAs for a school that doesn't have these problems, it probably doesn't exist. But a school the size of Mines should have a much better handle on them than it does. Especially since it claims to be at the forefront of engineering.",

We agree that Mines is overhyped and overpriced, and also that the problems of teachers' experience and effeciveness are not unique to the school. The latter point was essentially all I wanted to add, so as not to mislead prospectives, and now that you agree with me, I don't think there's much more to say about that.\n\nThis became needlessly hostile exchange, though. Your thought in your first post about Gen Chem teachers potentially making the class difficult out of malice indicates a severe emotional immaturity for an adult. Your tone, defensiveness, and disorganized ranting also indicate such. I guess from here, I would want prospectives to know that most students at Mines are not like this. Most students will go through their program at Mines without causing or experiencing as much social friction as you seem to. That's one thing I like about the school I guess. That and all the experienced professors ; )",

The vast majority of students here don't realize that.\n\nI'm sorry that you feel that my reflection of your response was hostile. You tried to insult me so I decided to treat you as an adult in the response.\n\nIf you don't believe that people can make things difficult for others simply because they can, the world will love you. I've experienced enough professors at this school that could help or improve things and refused to that I don't see it as a stretch.\n\nThe so called social friction is just seeing reality, at least on my end. Even if not everyone recognizes it, its there.\n\nI enjoy the experienced professors here too, most of the time. It just so happens there aren't that many around with experience.",

That's a perfectly valid general criticism of the university system as such, but it doesn't say much about Mines specifically except that Mines is also vulnerable to it.\n\nAs long as professors are making what they're making, it's going to be difficult for any university to attract people with industry experience.  Simple as that.  A civil PE makes more than your average professor, and civil is underpaid.  (Which might be correlated with the civil department having lots of good professors.)\n\n(Incidentally, I just noticed that every single one of the civil professors I think of as being among the best are indeed teaching faculty.)",

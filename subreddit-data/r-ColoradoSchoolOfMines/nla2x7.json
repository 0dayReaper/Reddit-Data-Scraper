I got kicked off the Mines track several times as a student and our club sport was denied use of it. I have no idea why Mines won\u2019t let people use it but luckily Bell is just down the street! Golden High School has some weird restrictions for public use too in my experience. I\u2019ve been successful there once but was also asked to leave once. Just my experience.",

So right now is probably a decent time because the people still competing are at nationals  rn so I doubt there\u2019s going to be anyone having a formal practice on it right now. If the gate is open I\u2019m sure you\u2019re fine to do a quick workout but if a coach is there it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask.",

Enjoy your visit! If your daughter is interested in the school I'd highly recommend she come back for a second visit in the fall. Campus will be online for the summer semesters but will be fully in person for the fall, so a visit then will give her a much better feel for what attending mines is really like.",

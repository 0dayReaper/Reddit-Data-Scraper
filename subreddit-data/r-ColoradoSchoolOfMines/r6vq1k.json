(2022) \n\nI\u2019m looking to go to Mines to see my significant other during my spring break, but being in college, the trip is kind of expensive with hotels and flights. \n\nI will pay rent and everything for the week, all definitely good with me. I\u2019d only be there to sleep at night. \n\nAny help is appreciated. Thanks in advance! \ud83d\ude0a",

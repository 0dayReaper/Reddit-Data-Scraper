    "postText": "I have been accepted into Mines\u2019 Civil Engineering program as an undergrad, but I\u2019m hesitating on whether or not I should go bc I\u2019ve heard that students are often drowning in work. I\u2019m open to taking challenging classes, but I don\u2019t want to destroy my college experience with homework like I kind of did with my senior year. If anyone could give me some insight into how manageable the workload at Mines really is, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

There are some challenging classes but honestly if you do your homework you\u2019ll be fine. Occasionally you will feel overwhelmed but I think it is fine and won\u2019t ruin your college time. I will say if you can take less credits or take classes over the summer at red rock it helps a lot.",

            "comment": "Mines purposely makes certain classes very challenging early on with a high work volume and difficulty in hopes most will drop, many students will go in having easily achieved a 4.0 in high school to have a gpa in the 2s at mines. Imo it's a very brutal school that makes you work hard for an engineering degree and the rates of burnout and unfortunately suicide are rather high to reflect this fact. So to me if you want to have a chill experience I personally wouldn't recommend it but who knows maybe it'll be easy for you.",

I flew through clac 1 and am doing good in calc 2. Skipped chem 1 and did well in Chem 2. Physics is the main issue here. It's just hard. If you use your TA's and study with friends you can do it. Also if you took physics in Highschool it really helps. But Mines will teach you what you need to be the best in your field and get a great job. Everyone here is also struggling but you do it together. Make sure you have good friends and have something else to take your mind off homework when you need a break. Your hard work gets rewarded so just stay on top of your work and you will be fine.",

I think most civil students that I know (myself included, as an undergrad) enjoyed their coursework and had a healthy workload, and outcomes are very good.\n\nI was a transfer student as an undergrad, and Mines is significantly tougher than the more typical state university program I attended, at least based on freshman-level courses.  But it's within reason, and the toughness comes with a *much* better education (two classes didn't transfer and I had to retake them, so I can make a direct comparison).\n\nThe experience is very department-specific, so I'd look to comments from people who are in civil or environmental.",

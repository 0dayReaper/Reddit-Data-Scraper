(Since the 15th, Mines has done roughly 1,200 tests).\n\nI was expecting us to do well, but I'm a little blown away by *how* well... and unless stuff gets really bad in the rest of the state, at this point I'd wager on staying hybrid for the rest of the semester.",

The testing rate is more or less constant, but the case and positivity rates have been declining.  Assuming about half of the undergraduates live on campus, the testing rate is consistent with testing the large majority of undergraduates every two weeks.\n\nFrom 8/17-8/31, they did 2,494 tests with 12 positive results, a positivity rate of 0.48%.\n\nFrom 9/1-9/15, they did 2,334 tests with 7 positive results, a positivity rate of 0.3%.\n\nAs of 9/22, they had done a total of 5,970 tests, which means that from 9/16-9/22 they did 1,142 tests with zero positive results and zero new cases reported from other testing.\n\nAll of this information is available in the source I linked at the top of the OP.",

CU Boulder did try to fudge the numbers (by not including off-campus testing)--and guess what?  Everyone knows about it.  And it showed up in Boulder County's stats big-time.\n\nOn top of that, all the student behavior I've seen would suggest students are, in fact, more or less complying.  I know someone who lives in a fraternity, someone else who works in residence life, and can vouch for Mines Park myself.  I hear from them, and see myself, that people are wearing masks and distancing.  I know the seniors are taking it seriously, and I'm told (by res. life guy) that the freshmen got a handle on compliance after the first few weeks.\n\nBesides that, yes, I do believe the school.  I know senior administrators and I trust them.  Why are some people so determined to see the school as evil?  What would their motive be for fudging the numbers?  It's not a for-profit institution.  They need to keep the school afloat, but beyond that they're not in it for money.  They're not elected officials (unlike at CU Boulder, since the CU board of regents are elected), so they don't need to have good numbers to run for re-election.",

If it could be pinned again I'd appreciate it and sorry in advance for promoting it again. I figured  this was a good time to post with a new set of students looking at Mines. \n\nYou can download my book/guide at [diggingdeeperatmines.wordpress.com](https://diggingdeeperatmines.wordpress.com)\n\nIts designed to be skimmed, and the table of contents is linked for your convenience. \n\nThanks :)",

I did my best to accurately describe the good and bad of mines, so please don't let the negative aspects completely discourage you. I just felt like the university isn't transparent sometimes and this should help give a more overall look.",

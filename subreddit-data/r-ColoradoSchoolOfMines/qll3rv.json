    "postText": "So I am currently thinking about taking the requirement for CSCI 101 at Red Rocks and I am wondering if anyone here had any experience with it. From what I understand I have to take two 3 credit courses and I was wondering what the workload and difficulty was like for these classes. Any input on this will be appreciated.",

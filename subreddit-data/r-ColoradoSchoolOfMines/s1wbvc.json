If your son wants to do business + engineering he should double major at a different school that has a good business program. Even better In my opinion is an engineer bachelors with a MBA.\n\nJust my thoughts.",

For CSM thats how I would combine Business + Engineering - as it opens both doors most effectively IMO.\n\nhttps://econbus.mines.edu/engineering-technology-management/",

    "postText": "It feels weird going here sometimes as a science major. After suffering through EDNS and seeing my meche roommates homework it's reinforced how much i don't want to be an engineer. So many people i meet ask me if i can help them with their code or solidworks designs and I'm just like \"Please ask me about chemicals so i don't sound like an idiot\"",

I eventually earned my PhD in Biochemistry and I couldn't be happier with where I am in my career.\n\nMost of my friends in school weren't chem majors, as obviously there aren't many, but it never felt weird to me.",

Happy to say it isn't something that stuck with me years later, so I guess just grin and bear it. If you have any questions about the path I took both at and after Mines, shoot me a DM. Good luck with everything.",

            "comment": "Math major here! Graduated last year. It did feel weird every now and then, especially since out of my friend group I was the only one with my major and everyone else with either electrical or computer science. I didn't find another math major until spring semester sophomore year because there's so much overlap between majors and classes before that point. \n\nThe only time I saw the most disconnect was during career fair and job postings. I know the majority of students are doing some sort of engineering, but its like they forget that math majors also exist. And whenever they advertise jobs or internships for math majors, they're really only looking for either a computer science or math/comp sci student. \n\nIt can get a little frustrating because in that aspect it feels like there's little to no support for your major, but there is. You have faculty and other students in your majora there. You just got to go out and find them. There might not be many of them as MechEs or Civils, but they are out there.",

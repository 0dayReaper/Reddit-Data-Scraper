Class names have changed since I took them so I don't know what specific classes your talking about, but I'd say the most valuable intro DS course is applied statistics. If you can tell me the names of the classes I can give more specific advice.",

I haven't personally taken it, but based on the course description it seems like an extremely useful class, since GLMs and Mixed models are fundamental to advanced data analytics. The rest of these classes besides Multivariate are more special topics. If you have a particular interest in any of the other classes then I would suggest it, I've taken the rest and they're all good. If not, you will get the most value out of 436. \n\nAnother thing to consider is spatial is taught by Doug Nychka, my favorite professor and bona fide stats daddy.",

However, it requires a solid linear algebra background and many found it challenging, the median on the first midterm was like a 55/60 (though the prof offered generous test corrections). The homework workload is not too heavy.",

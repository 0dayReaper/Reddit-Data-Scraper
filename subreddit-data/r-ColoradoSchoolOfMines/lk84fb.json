    "postText": "In EPICS/EDNS 151 they show you a bunch of shitty prototypes that led to awesome innovations; sharpies and bent paperclips that google engineers used to simulate the form of google's iglass and whatnot. Have any graduates or interns *actually* made a prototype for something out of, like, toilet paper rolls and bubblegum and been taken seriously? Just curious; I've never had to for any of my internships, thus far. But would love to hear from people who tried it out!",

            "comment": "Oh yes, I've made a lot of janky prototypes that worked surprisingly well.  The key to do this sort of work is to work with start-up companies that have tons of ambition combined with almost no money. That being said, I've also done some pretty janky stuff in government labs too, mostly because they have so much stuff lying around. Here's a selection of my favorite bodged-together prototypes:\n\nI was using a fancy optical sensor to detect a laser in a NASA facility that simulates reentry conditions for heat shields.  The sensor was picking up stray light from the room instead of light from a window to the chamber where the experiment took place.  I found a cardboard tube in a pile of discarded shipping materials and spray painted the inside black.  Then I slipped it over my sensor and put the other end on the window to the experiment.  No more stray light problems.\n\nA start up I was working with needed a fancy instrument that spins material in a clear drum and watches how the material flows.  The real instrument was expensive so we built one out of an old drum that used to hold ketchup, plexiglas, some lights from Home Depot, and a tool for mixing drums of chemicals that rolls them on their side.  We used a cellphone to record video and found some free software to get the data we needed.  Used the data in a patent application.\n\nWe needed a method to stir materials in a drum full of chemicals.  We couldn't afford a real piece of equipment so I modified a Harbor Freight concrete mixer with 2x4s and bike inner tubes to spin a drum.  That bodge worked for at least a year.\n\nI was working on a process where I had things in a sealed process vessel and I needed them to stay in place during the process.  I ended up using cheesecloth and kitchen twine from the grocery store. I tied up the product like a roast before it went in the process vessel. It worked so well the company sold $20k worth of product from the process and the customer was thrilled with how it turned out.\n\nThose are a few memories that stand out.  There have been plenty of systems that require a sharp tap with a hammer along the way as well.",

            "comment": "I can second this, I\u2019ve definitely made some janky stuff. You might think it sounds ridiculous to show your boss some rolled up pieces of paper with rubber bands and sticky notes all over it, but what\u2019s really ridiculous is to try and describe an abstract idea. I would obviously never present anything like this in a meeting, but just talking to my boss at my design-based internships it was really encouraged so that we don\u2019t waste time modeling or prototyping something that has an extreme flaw right from the beginning. Sometimes it just really helps communicate an idea. I\u2019ve also had coworkers who are much better at drawing than me, so they would communicate their ideas that way, but I\u2019ve found the janky prototypes to be a bit easier for someone with my art abilities.",

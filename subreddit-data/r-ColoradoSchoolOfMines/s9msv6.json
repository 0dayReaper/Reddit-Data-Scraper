    "postText": "Hey everyone. My stepbrother and I are freshmen and have been living in Spruce so far this year and are now looking for other dudes(and possibly dudettes) to live with. I am 23 and a mechanical engineering major while my little bro is 18 and a petroleum major. Here\u2019s a little about myself: I play the drums and practice constantly. It is my dream to one day have my own band kind of like Megadeth or Gojira, so I practice every few hours. Im very much a night person and will prefer to sleep during the day whenever I have the chance. We both have a very high tolerance for messiness, so if you dont mind living in squalor this is the place for you. Other activities i engage in involve gaming, watching streams, listening to heavy metal, watching movies and shows, watching youtube, watching podcats, browsing the internet, and browsing memes. I am definitely more of an indoors type and don\u2019t go out if i dont need to. We are willing to share food but we don\u2019t cook, I\u2019ll probably end up living off takeout and frozen food which I love. I also own a couch we can use for furniture, but will need to find other stuff i think. Anyways, let me know if you are interested. We have a good budget and want an actual house.",

Some fucking assholes were shitting on OP and his brother when he was looking for roommates just because of his honesty when he first posted it in the freshman discord.\n\nIt's actually good though tbh being honest about things that matter to roommates.",

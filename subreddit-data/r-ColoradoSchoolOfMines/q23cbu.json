    "postText": "With many students taking midterms right now, it's important to realize that failure isn't the end of the world. It can be incredibly hard to accept a grade, particularly when that grade is below the class average, but it's important to stay positive during hard times. It is not often that a singular grade will tank an entire class, but if it does or if a grade becomes irrecoverable withdrawing from a class will not  ruin your future.  Keep working hard, and realize that you all belong here. Taking an extra semester, or retaking a class is okay, and more students have to do so than it seems. \n\nAnd take the wins when you get them. If you get a grade that you are proud of, make sure to celebrate  and give yourself credit. It's so easy to focus on the negatives, putting yourself down when you don't meet your own lofty standards, and many times we forget to congratulate ourselves and others for our accomplishments.\n\nWe're all in this together. Make sure to step back occasionally, take a deep breath, and look at how far you've come. \n\nHave a great day Orediggers",

Granted, some of the reasons it took me this long were out of my control, but I made it. It took a lot of finding my limits, tons of patience, and of course, a fuckload of hard work. I'm not a failure, because I didn't give up, and *that* is something I'm proud of.\n\nDon't let small missteps distract you from the progress you're making. You can do this!",

Remember most great scientists were not successful in classes but they had that extraordinary ability to think and worked day and night to achieve their goals. As long as you are engaging your brain and thinking about things, you will do great. Classes and grades are not the most complete assessment of your abilities. Cheers Orediggers!!",

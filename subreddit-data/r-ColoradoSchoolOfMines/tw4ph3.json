What I will say, however, is that you really stop doing things with the group after the first month of the semester just due to how busy Mines gets.\n\nIt was a really nice way to meet people during the first weeks of the semester and most of my friend that I have made at Mines, I made through VPA.\n\nIt was a really nice way to meet people during the first weeks of the semester and most of my friends that I have made at Mines, I made through VPA.\n\nEDIT: And to actually answer your question: basically all TLCs do ore digger camp 3 and move in a week earlier than the rest of campus, and do more floor events together. For me, the biggest thing was meeting people that I knew had things in common with me. One thing that I noticed about VPA, in particular, is that most people in it are artists and painters. The next biggest portion was musicians followed by theatre folks.  \nFeel free to DM me with any questions about VPA and/or Mines.",

TLCs will host little community nights here and there, as well as a handful of excursions throughout the year. you'll be interacting with these people since each TLC is based in its own dorm.\r  \n\r  \nsome TLCs are better established than others, there's some out there where you'll maybe meet once and do a service project and that'll be it. i don't suggest the newer TLCs as i've heard they don't meet up as much/aren't as tight, but VPA, as well as Athleticism and Wellness, are some of the tightest communities. i really enjoy the people, and VPA activities are fun.\r  \n\r  \ni decided to live in Morgan hall not knowing that it hosted a TLC, so it turned out that half of the second and third floors were members of VPA. it seemed dope and i already had experience with piano and graphic design so i just asked to tag along in their outings and stuff. easy honorary vpa member",

            "comment": "VPA Alum\n\nBasically, the Themed Learning Communities are just a bunch of people with similar interests put on the same floor of the dorms so the first people you meet all have something in common with you. About half of the people in my VPA floor were at my wedding (my wife was also VPA), so you can definitely form some long-lasting connections there.\n\nEvery RA needs to put on regular events and activities for their residents, it's part of the job. The TLCs just have a bit more of a theme to them. VPA does art and talent shows, ALC goes camping. Non-TLC floors sometimes go bowling or see a movie.\n\nThere's no obligation tied up with the TLCs: It doesn't require you to be in band/orchestra/choir/theater/etc. But, a lot of your floormates will be. It helped me a lot because I knew who to talk to when different arts crossed over: Music folks weren't getting info from theater folks about the upcoming musical and if they needed musicians for the pit. I knew the theater folks in my year's VPA so I helped get them in touch with the band people. One of my friends wanted her poetry in high grade, but wanted to rap them to a beat. I recorded some bass tracks with her and she submitted it to the journal. We made a music video for a Halloween contest, putting together our musicians, actors, theater makeup, and video editors... And then placed 2nd because the soccer team showed up to the party with all their friends, voted for themselves, and immediately left before results were announced :-/",

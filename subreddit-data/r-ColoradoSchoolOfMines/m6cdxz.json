The rooms are a bit bigger here than the other dorms, and when stuff works (first year resident here, there have been a lot of bugs being slowly worked out with construction) are really nice. The ceiling lights have adjustable brightness and color temperature. Each room has individual temperature control (within a range). Each wing has a large coed bathroom with 7 showers, 7 toilets, and 8 sinks. The stalls are large and walled in so the coed part is a bit less weird, you just have to deal with with the other sex's hair in either the sink drain (facial hair) or shower drains (long hair). The center wing is a bit larger than the other 2 wings so their bathrooms are a bit more crowded. Each floor has 2 small study rooms with a table, 2 medium study rooms with some furniture and a sink, and one large communal common room with a full kitchen and a couple large couches. The lobby has an even larger kitchen and a good lot of seating. The basement has a foosball and ping pong table and another good lot of seating, as well as the laundry room. Each floor is supposed to have a tv in the big common room but they aren't quite all installed. yet.",

    "postText": "Hello all, i am trying to get a degree and play with cement. A couple of my friends GPAs plummeted  when they took calc 2, which is a little scary to me because both of them love math and are dedicated students. I am wondering if it is better to get into mines while my GPA is acceptable for transfer, or stay the course at CC and save some money.",

And yeah  if you build up your GPA a bit before taking the hit from calc, it looks better. Honestly it never hurts to just reach out to an advisor at mines and ask if you\u2019re worried!",

If you look at the curriculum flowchart for any major, the classes that flow from that one will be project based. There are, of course, many project-heavy classes at Mines, but the project/design classes that can hold a transfer student back a few semesters are the ones that follow EDNS 151.",

            "comment": "Like others have said, there are some pre-reqs required to be eligible to transfer and a minimum GPA. However, another important thing to consider is when you transfer (fall or spring), it is possible to transfer in either. being a transfer student, the flowchart doesn't usually match up perfectly since its designed as a freshman to senior track. That makes some semesters more difficult because you may have to take sophomore classes as a junior or even a senior because some courses are only taught in either fall or spring. That being said, I'm not sure if it applies to civil, but senior design is a 2 semester course based on a group. Obviously you can't/won't need to plan everything so that it lines perfect but depending on your circumstance it may be smart to see what other courses transfer (diff eq or econ for example) to try and match your courses up to best fit future pre requirement courses that are only taught once a year. This isn't a big deal as exceptions can be made, but It will behoove you to get your courses squared away so that you can be on track so you don't have to back load a bunch of courses later or stay a semester extra for only senior design. \n\nI'm not a civil, but I'm a transfer graduating soon. Feel free to pm me with any questions.",

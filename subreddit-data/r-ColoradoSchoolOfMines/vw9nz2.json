    "postText": "I know, more questions about what kind of computer I should be getting... sorry. I'm just trying to figure out how much RAM I will actually need for my laptop, I'm planning on ME or ChemE, and I'm curious how much of your computer's RAM you actually use/think is necessary, and how often you use the school's computers. (I'm ok with using the school's labs for the occasionally large project that uses a bunch of RAM, but would like to be able to do most normal things on my machine.)\n\nThank you all so much in advance!",

So it seems like for the time being school computers and a smaller personal laptop will be fine?",

School computer use depends largely on your schedule, as for the first couple of semesters of ChemE the most you might need is Excel for tedious calculations. Computer use becomes more important for later classes, mostly Computer Methods and Separations since you need to use Aspen Plus which is only on the school computers. Again, everything else can more or less be done in Excel on your own device. During summer field session, most work can be done on your own device (word processing, excel calculations, etc.) except if you need to use Aspen.",

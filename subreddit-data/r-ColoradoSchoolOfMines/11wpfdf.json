    "postText": "Hey everyone!\n\nI know a bunch of us are nerds with anxiety, so I wanted to offer an open invitation to anyone who has ever wanted to try LARP, but was too nervous to go without anyone they know. \n\nThe event this weekend is with Dystopia Rising Colorado, which is a post-apocalyptic, hope punk LARP with an amazing community that is really welcoming to new players. The event is from Friday night to Sunday afternoon, lodging is provided, and a meal plan is available so you don't have to worry about bringing food. Boffer weapons and Nerf guns can be borrowed from the game for your first few times, and I am happy to help with costuming if anyone is nervous about putting that together. \n\nI can bring one person for free if money is a barrier, and any other new players get their first game for half price. I can also provide a ride down to the site for up to three people. \n\nIf you've been looking to get into LARP, I highly recommend this community. They've done a really great job of creating a welcoming environment for new players and a safe space for queer folks and POC. I've been attending for almost 2 years now, and it is become a great source of community and stress relief for me that I wanted to share with the rest of the Mines community.\n\nI hope everyone's spring break is going great and I look forward to hearing from folks if anyone is interested :)",

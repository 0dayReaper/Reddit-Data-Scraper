I was hoping to get Chem when it's still fresh in my mind. \n\nI know seats filled up stupidly fast, but anyone have any thoughts?",

A lot of my friends added classes after the first week since they felt they could take the course load, but I definitely recommend talking with your counselor!\n\nEdit: grammatical errors",

It looks like most of the deadlines are in July, but you can check here: https://www.mines.edu/graduate-admissions/fall-deadlines/\n\nPretty sure I got an email once my application was actually sent to the department for review, but you could always call/email grad admissions.",

However, your application might have been in waitlist incase some students decide to not attend mines (which happens a lot). I would email the department/admissions and ask about the application status.",

I use an old iPhone 5, and DUO is not compatible with that device, and every time I go onto canvas, it says i need to approve it with duo before i can log in. It's super annoying to have to borrow a device every time i need to log into my summer class, so is there a way to turn duo off, or not need the app or something?",

Then you can set it up with mfa.mines.edu. Push notifs won\u2019t work, but whenever it says pushed a login request on your computer click cancel, then Call Me. Answer the call, press 5 and hang up, and you\u2019re in. I\u2019m jailbroken on iOS 11 and this trick works great.",

That won't keep you logged in permanently, but it lasts for a few days (maybe a week?) before it kicks you out.\n\nI'm not aware of any way to properly stay logged in, which is really stupid and unusual for 2FA.  Everything else I use with 2FA lets you stay logged in for at least 30 days.",

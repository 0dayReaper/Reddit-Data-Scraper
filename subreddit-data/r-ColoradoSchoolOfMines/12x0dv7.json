I was just wondering about what the workload would be like in hours per day on the weekdays and then for the weekends for a cs major? One last thing, do my highschool senior grades matter much?? Thanks",

If you are coming into college with little to no prior experience, which is the norm, then you should expect it to be difficult as all majors are at Mines. If you have existing experience, it could potentially be easier.",

            "comment": "the cs department is going through a revamp, so classes tend to be more difficult as professors figure out how to balance their expectations within the class. also, you will be taking 12+ credits of STEM classes (with a few HASS or econ classes)... professors tend to forget that, especially in cs. i have had professors admit that their class should come first (looking at csci306). \n\nyou'll be fine if you have experience with Object Oriented Programming, especially in C++ and Java. it's a hard major if you have very little experience with OOP, or programming in general. but, also, this is Mines where our fight song is about drinking... if you want easy, don't come here.\n\nbut also, that silver diploma salary is very nice, especially if you have social skills + cs",

            "comment": "It really depends on the classes you\u2019re taking. CSCI 400, 406 and 442 all have a well deserved reputation for being difficult and taking a substantial amount of time to be successful in outside of class. You should also keep in mind that you need to take a lot of STEM classes (3 semesters of calc, diff dq, physics etc), so if you need more time to learn those things then the workload will be bigger.",

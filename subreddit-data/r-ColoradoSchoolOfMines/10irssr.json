    "postText": "I recently got accepted into the master\u2019s program in economical geology with an RA position. I have two questions for you guys. \n\nI wanted to hear from current students where the most affordable area to live is that is within 30 minutes of Golden. The stipend is certainly not enough to live off of in Golden so I will be needing extra income from fellowships, scholarships, jobs, etc. but even with all that I would still need to live in the most affordable area if possible. Do any of you have recommendations?\n\nThe second question Is in regards to the program itself. Does anybody have experience with economical geology in terms of classes, projects, and prospective jobs?\n\nThanks!",

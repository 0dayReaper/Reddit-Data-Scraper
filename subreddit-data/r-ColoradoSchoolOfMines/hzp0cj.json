I was hammered and went into the bathroom in the Green Center (on the left side of the auditorium) and there\u2019s that little door that you can open above the leftmost urinal. Well I opened it and there was literally a pigs head in there. Must have been a prank of sorts cuz it didn\u2019t smell bad but there was a damn pigs head in the bathroom. Wild",

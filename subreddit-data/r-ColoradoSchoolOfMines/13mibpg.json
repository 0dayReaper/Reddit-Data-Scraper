From your experience, is there a way to increase the chances of getting a single room dorm? Please let me know, thanks!",

It\u2019s probably not happening. \n\nNot only are there a very small amount of singles on campus, they\u2019re also very likely to diminish even further since Mines keeps upping the freshmen numbers and converting more rooms to doubles/triples since we already don\u2019t have enough space. The only thing would maybe if you happened to have a very early deposit, therefore a very early housing assignment, or you happened to lose your roommate early on, but it\u2019s totally possible they\u2019d still stick another person with you anyway. \n\nMy only advice is to stick to the newer dorms like Spruce and Elm, since I think they have a fraction of more designated singles (although they\u2019re typically reserved for RAs and those with accessibility needs, etc), while I\u2019ve never even heard of singles in the older dorms like the trads or Weaver.",

    "postText": "I just wanted to pop in and wish the Freshman good luck. The school is hard and the challenges ahead are real but you will leave with the tools you need to be a great Engineer. A lot of people feel overwhelmed or as if they cannot do it and most of them look back at that moment and realize that is what we came here for, to learn something and you are not expected to know it, you are expected to learn it. So be strong and have faith in yourself, if I can do it you can too!",

I by no means exemplify bias towards Mines students and want other candidates to thrive in interviews, but I consistently see students from Mines stand out from others. \n\nI realize some will argue other universities can provide similar programs and will get students prepared for their careers which I\u2019m certain they do, but Mines exemplifies this to another degree as shown in the candidates I see. Personally, the work ethic I gained from Mines geared towards my specific industry has allowed me to be successful in the work place and that is why it changed the trajectory of my life.",

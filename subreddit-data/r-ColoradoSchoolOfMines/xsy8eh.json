    "postText": "I got a 4 on my AP Chem exam 4 years ago so came into Mines with Chem 1 credit. I\u2019m thinking about changing majors and would need to take Chem 1 &amp; 2, as well as organic chemistry, but I don\u2019t remember anything from my AP Chem class. Does Chem 2 at mines work heavily off of Chem 1 knowledge, or would I be fine taking Chem 2 and organic Chem without retaking Chem 1?",

I took the chalange exam and passed, so 2 weeks into semester, I jumped into Chem 2. Bit rough, but if you know your stuff and can study, no problem",

In general, taking courses out of sequence or in a non-traditional manner *does* cause some difficulty, but you can certainly pass Chem 2 without having reeeeaaaally taken Chem 1.",

Even if you don\u2019t feel super confident a quick look over your AP chem notes should suffice and you should be good to go for chem 2.",

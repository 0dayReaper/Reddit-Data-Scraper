    "postText": "Hey y'all, this is just a post to remind everyone that regardless of what you are majoring in, regardless of the classes you are taking, or regardless of how you all are struggling, none of you are alone. Mines is a really hard school and it is so easy to feel like you are the only one that is having a difficult time. Stick with it. You all belong at this school, and struggling is normal. People may be at different points of their learning journeys or careers, but comparing yourself to other people isn't a way to justify that you don't belong or that you aren't smart enough to succeed. Everyone is progressing at their own pace, and sometimes it's important to step back, take a breath, and look back at what you've achieved to get to this point. You all matter and we as a community need to support each other to get through this happy, healthy, and optimistic about the future.\n\nHave a great day Orediggers, and please continue to support each other in the future!",

Don't dwell on it... you're not supposed to know what you're doing yet.  The unfortunate truth is that your college education will only account for a small percentage of your professional knowledgebase, with the vast majority of it coming from on-the-job training and direct experience in the field.\n\nSchool can never prepare you for the details of how every company does business, and it's easy to fall into the mental trap when you start work that you don't know what you're doing and must not have been paying enough attention.\n\nYou're fine... you graduated for a reason, just give yourself some time to figure out how to operate in whatever company you end up at.",

I had never interacted with web dev in my life, and that's what I was assigned to do. \n\nIt's normal to have to learn a lot of new stuff for a job. It doesn't mean you fooled them, it doesn't mean you didn't learn the things you were supposed to, it doesn't mean you are not good enough. ***All jobs will require you to learn things and that does not mean you are not qualified for the position.***",

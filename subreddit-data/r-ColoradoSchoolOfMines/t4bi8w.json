    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all I\u2019ve been accepted into Mines for Civil engineering for fall 2022.  I\u2019m not good at math, even with studying and many late nights I\u2019m barely going to pass calculus (not AP and not honors) my senior year of HS.  I barely passed Precal as well.  I guess I\u2019m asking if going to mines would be a mistake for someone who is genuinely bad at math.  I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ll get in way over my head and won\u2019t be able to pass the majority of math and basic engineering classes.  Any advice would be great.",

If it\u2019s the latter, I wouldn\u2019t come here.  \n\n If you do decide to come, spend a lot of time this summer brushing up on algebra and trig. You won\u2019t be expected to know any calculus, so don\u2019t worry about that. Be prepared to put in more effort than your peers and struggle in the beginning. But it\u2019s very doable, and if you got accepted clearly someone believes in you. Good luck!",

            "comment": "There is a lot to be said for a change in setting changing your academic performance. Your professors will have tons of office hours, and if you just go to those office hours to study they will be willing to work with you to help you pass. Hell, when other classes require calculus concepts, they will eventually become low-key second nature - which is really cool. \n\nBut Mines is one of few colleges where every major requires a math emphasis to some degree. So you can't transfer into the humanities if you find you can't do it. And Mines is a difficult school! Is it really that much harder than another school with the same program? I think so, but you'll have to learn math to be a civil engineer regardless. \n\nThe one thing I'd say about Mines (or maybe it's engineering generally) is that you have a ton of classes to take, so if you're worried about being overwhelmed be prepared to take summer classes, or graduate in 5 years, to slow down the rate you're taking classes. \n\nIt's hard to give advice here because I'm not in the business of crushing dreams. But damn, did I struggle hard at Mines - and especially with math. It was long struggle that wasn't necessarily healthy for me, but I did graduate! \n\nI guess TL,DR; it's going to be hard. You can do it. If you want to be an engineer, you owe it to yourself to try.",

But u/LevitarDoom has a hell of a point...if you like math you can get through it.\n\nI barely passed any classes the first year I was at Mines, but year two got a little easier, then year three even easier, and year four too. If someone wants to try and put in the work, Mines has a number of resources that you can utilize to help you. From learning how to study to actually helping you with the homework, there are tools like CASA or Office Hours or even your peers that will help along the way.\n\nAs a Civil tho, let me say, once you're done with the Calcs and Chems and Phys classes, the Civil Classes will be so much fun. The profs like Jeff and Dre are super awesome and helpful. You can do it, it'll be hard work but it pays off.",

            "comment": "You'd be surprised at how many engineering classes are actually mostly math with conceptual stuff thrown in there. I sure was. I hate the math side of things, but love everything else about engineering. If you still really want to be an engineer, it might be worth looking into doing your math courses at Red Rocks CC then transferring them to Mines. I've heard it's easier to do math and physics there than here. Mines likes to make these classes tougher than they need to be.  \nThat being said, a good chunk of people here suck at math and still get okay enough grades to graduate. You won't be alone in your struggles!",

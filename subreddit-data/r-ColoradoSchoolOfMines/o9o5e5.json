One thing I really wish Mines Park had is Covered Bike Racks- just something to keep them dry in the rain and cool in the sun. More than one Ethernet plug in the living room would have been nice as well I guess.",

I lived pretty far from the community center and never went there. Would have used bike repair stations, workout equipment, grills, picnic tables, etc.",

They (Mines) moved her to another unit, where a pipe subsequently burst a few months after she moved in. It seemed the apartments were built cheaply the first time around and I know there was probably a strict budget, but solid piping seems mildly important. After hearing her horror stories I decided to not live there and looked elsewhere.",

I was on the north end next to 19th st so fewer campus police snooping around but they still did come say hi sometimes. Feels like an off-campus apartment but you still get to be around tons of other students so it's very fun and lively (if you want it to be), and if you have a bike it's like 5 minutes down the hill to any building on campus. 100% would recommend. There's also a little area of woods just uphill from the upper parking lot where you can ride your bike or have a beer or smoke in private just please don't leave trash in there.",

            "comment": "You do not need an SUV for winter conditions. If your heart is set on an SUV, go for it, however, you can get by in a car just fine. The important thing is dedicated winter/snow tires. If you really want to feel comfortable, get something with 4WD/AWD, but front wheel drive will perform well, again with good tires. All the 4WD does is make it easier to get moving, but it won't help you stop or turn. Invest in good tires. \nIf you want specific recommendations, what is your price range?",

Part of my reason for upgrade is that I want to be able to visit the deserts in Utah and other such offroad-ish adventures with no issues.\n\nI'm going to be buying used, since my budget is $7,000-$10,000, so I know my options are limited. I'd love to hear your recommendations.",

                            "comment": "I think its doable to find an suv under 10K, especially if you look at stuff that's 15+ years old. My personal preference are Toyota 4Runners, either 3rd or 4th gen. Reliable, runs forever, capable off road out of the box, passable fuel economy, huge amount of aftermarket support. However, everyone else knows that 4Runners are great, so the prices reflect that. You can probably find one in good condition with okay mileage from like 8-10k, (that's a guess, I haven't looked in a while). A few ther recommendations include the FZJ80 and FZJ100 Toyota Land Cruiser, Chevy Tahoe/Suburban/GMC Yukon. There's more than that too, that's off the top of my head. \n\nOne last thing to consider, SUVs have big wheels and tires, and that makes tires considerably more expensive, and not to sound like a broken record, but again, tires are the most important variable of the whole scenario, so keep that in mind as you're shopping as well.",

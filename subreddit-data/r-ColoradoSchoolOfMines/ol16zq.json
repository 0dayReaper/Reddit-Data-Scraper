    "postText": "My current company is currently looking to hire several entry and mid level positions in Minnesota. We also have some drafting roles open if anyone is interested! These are NOT remote positions, and you would have to relocate to Minnesota, but the pay and benefits are EXTREMELY competitive, and the overall company for me at least has been amazing! \n\nWe are in the industrial and agriculture area and work closely with many different companies including within medical, food processing, and utilities areas! This is a great opportunity to experience many types of engineering and industries! \n\nIf interested feel free to shoot me a message and I'm happy to share experiences!",

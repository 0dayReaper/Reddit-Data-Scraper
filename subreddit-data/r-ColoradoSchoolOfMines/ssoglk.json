            "comment": "I want to assure you that it's not a problem with you, that's just the social dynamic at Mines. The vast majority of students here are not that receptive to new friends for various reasons; they're awkward engineering nerds; they came to Mines with a friend group from high school/CC; they're too busy/depressed/stressed/whatever. I've been to a few other schools, and I'd say generally 4-years have a clique-based social scene that's tough to penetrate as an outsider. At Mines, that seems especially true given the above. \n\nIn my experience as kind of an outsider student, you will have the best luck forging a social life through clubs/organizations, *plural*. I can't make you do anything, but if I could, I would say you HAVE to join a professional interest group first (SWE, AIAA, ASME, etc). They're usually big and active, there's no stressful time commitment, and it seems like people go into them with somewhat of an expectation of meeting and socializing with others. After that, I would say to join a an engineering and/or hobby club. If you can take on more responsibility and time commitments, the engineering clubs (SAE, robotics, etc) are great for making friends because you usually *have* to work as part of a team. I wouldn't say they're quite as social as the professional interest groups, but you can count on making a few acquaintances this way. If you don't really want the time commitment of an engineering club, there's always a hobby club (art clubs, cooking clubs, etc). I don't have experience with these, so if someone else could chime in that would be great. My impression is that a few are really active, but most are not. Absolutely worth doing a bit of research on this, though.\n\nAnyway, yeah. I know it doesn't help to simply say it, but it is seriously not a problem with you; it's just the way Mines is. Join an interest group, and explore the other clubs if you can. It's an important part of the college experience, and the easiest way to get yourself out there!",

One's early college years are already disorienting; you had Covid thrown into the mix, and seem to have suffered greatly from it. \n\nMy take? This is an internal battle you're fighting during a confusing time, and you should find a professional to help you navigate it; I'm sure you already know that. Intellectually, you should know that most people are too caught up in their own world to be so hateful or suspicious of one person such as yourself. But it's one thing to know that, and another to believe it. You should try to give yourself a strong sober moment, now, and [schedule an appointment with the Counselling Center](https://www.mines.edu/counseling-center/request-appointment/). Make yourself schedule the appointment, show up (it may be a few days from now), and get all these thoughts and others out there so a professional can help you make sense of them. \n\nThat's about all I can offer you as words on a screen. But please do me a favor: you've just read my whole comment. Don't do \\*anything\\* else, except schedule that appointment right now. Click the link, fill in the required fields, and you'll have finished taking the hardest step in getting help in \\~2 minutes.",

            "comment": "I'm really sorry you're feeling that way. Mines being a small school of engineers makes finding friends (particularly post-freshman-initiation) harder. The best suggestion I can give in regards to getting more friends is to join clubs, sports, etc. Join things where you'll be seeing the same people repeatedly in a non-class setting as much as possible. Greek Life is another good bet for this issue. Regardless, It's not that people hate you and are just being friendly to you, it's that people, in general, don't make their friends through classes or by living near you. All of my friends have come through the organizations I am in.   \nIf you're still feeling isolated after joining organizations, I second the comment I saw earlier about reaching out to the counseling center. They have counselors that specialize in helping people with lonely feelings and meeting people.",

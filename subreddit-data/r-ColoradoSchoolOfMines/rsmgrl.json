    "postText": "**UPDATE: After carefully taking multiple perspectives including but not limited to these replies, I have decided to take Phys 2 in the summer instead in order to maintain a more reasonable workload that works better for me. Thank you.**\n\nI'm a first-year who came in with a ton of transfer credit from high school, the bulk of it from dual enrollment through CCD. (EDIT: More specifically, I brought in Calc 1, Chem 1, all 18 credits of my free electives, Global Studies, both of my HASS mid levels, CSCI 101 and 261, and econ).\n\nFor my first semester, CASA gave me 16.5 credit hours, 6 classes total, namely Calc 2, Phys 1, Thorson, Freshman Seminar, Intro to Linux, and Data Structures. While my other classes were fine, I ended up barely passing Calc 2 and Phys 1.\n\nThis upcoming semester, I am taking a whopping 18.5 credit hours. This consists of the same number of classes, this time being Calc 3, Phys 2, Thorson (the second part), Comp Org, Software Engineering, and a phys ed.\n\nI have been told by a few peers that I've talked to that my schedule is already excessive and that I should drop a class as to not completely demolish my GPA (standing at a 2.7 and I lose my scholarship if it hits below 2.5).\n\nMy goal is to graduate early. Credit-wise, it is possible for me to graduate as early as Fall 2023 even by taking the minimum credits required for full-time status.\n\nAs such, this summer I plan on knocking out Diff Eq, Linear Algebra, and Statistics online at CCD once more. Given that my schedule for this spring may be excessive, I am considering dropping Phys 2 (since it's not a prereq for any CS classes and I've heard good things about taking it online at a CCCS institution) for now and taking it this summer with these classes.\n\nWith that, am I better off taking Phys 2 at Mines this semester or at CCD this summer?\n\n*Note: With Phys 2, I'd be taking 14 credit hours both this semester and this summer. I'd say I'm pretty comfortable with the pace of summer classes. The most I've taken at CCD is 17 credits, the hardest that semester being Chem 1. Last summer, right before I started here at Mines, I took 12 credit hours (all mid-level: my humanities electives and both econ classes) to transfer here.*",

Taking an extra semester or two is nothing compared to leaving your health on the backburner so long you have no choice but to wash out. You need to set yourself up for success in a more broad sense than just exceeding your own expectations; allow yourself some room for failure. Graduating on time is already admirable.\n\nJust my 2 cents. Good luck.",

            "comment": "In my 4 years as a student who made dumb decisions, and as a peer mentor, etc. I\u2019ve learned high credit hour semesters aren\u2019t indicative of a \u201cdifficult\u201d semester. It\u2019s usually the types of classes you choose that will make the semester more or less difficult. I\u2019m not too familiar with the CS classes you are scheduled for. I would point to other redditors/casa advisors/students to tell you that. My general advice here is as follows:\n\n-Balance your classes based on difficulty and work content. Not on credit hours. \n\n-Tailor your balance to what YOU can handle. Not what other people can. Everybody is different. If you have experience taking heavy courseload/difficult classes (i.e. IB, AP, Com. College) you might be set up to take more difficult courses that take more time. If you are a person who doesn\u2019t fare well with a loaded schedule (like having classes and extra curriculars) maybe steer away from the heavier loaded semesters\n\n- What\u2019s your rush to graduate early? My personal argument is that college and life in general is a marathon, not a sprint. You might burn yourself out sooner than you think by pushing yourself too hard to graduate early. If this is a financial decision, I can respect that. Do you anticipate going to grad school? If you want to attend grad school at a place other than Mines you may want to spread things out so you can prepare for the tests, make connections with PI\u2019s, etc. Also, being a recent graduate, I miss Mines honestly. I rushed through it for financial reasons and still regret it despite being very in debt.\n\n-do you anticipate only taking courses during the summer? depending on what you want to do after school, you can make yourself an extremely competitive candidate for positions via internships and research experiences. In my experience 9/10 people with a decent GPA get chosen for jobs if they have work experience rather than a higher GPA. Even if you don\u2019t have a solid GPA, having work experience is almost MORE important than graduating early. Unless you plan on doing Med school - that\u2019s a different story but you\u2019re a CS major so I don\u2019t think you are. If you have solid family or friend connections with a company or know someone that would likely hire you regardless of your GPA and work experience and that\u2019s what you want to do - then godspeed my friend.\n\n\nI hope that wasn\u2019t too much advice. Hopefully it helps and other people agree. Feel free to disagree, this are my observations from mentoring 90+ students. Please DM me with any specific advice anytime.",

Not chump change by any means.\n\nOf course, graduating early is hard mentally and socially, losing your scholarship might put you in a deeper hole, and typically it's much harder to find a job with a sub 3.0 GPA especially with minimal internship experience. So definitely a balancing act, it's a hard school",

And while my grades weren\u2019t much of a problem I would say taking longer while maintaining a higher gpa is probably preferable. \n\nOverall you do you but don\u2019t kill yourself to graduate early.",

You seem to be trying to pull off the same thing I assume?  Want to know my secret?\n\nI took 12 credit semesters (well, sometimes more with fun extra classes). If I had been crazy, it was possible for me to graduate in 1.5 years with maxed out semesters and one summer semester like yours. Instead, I stretched it out to 2.5 years so I could live and, well, even enjoy myself a bit.  \n\nWe mostly transferred in the same credits, but I came in with all the calcs and phys classes. I don't think my model is possible with your timeline, and that's okay. Take an extra semester or two. Your hard work from HS has bought you that luxury, those poor ChemEs are sobbing at our privilege lol. \n\nI get it if it's for financial reasons. If I had stayed at Mines a semester longer I'd start going into debt. Money is always a big factor. However, from what I've read of your post, jeopardizing your health, grades, and scholarship has a higher cost. \n\n(oh, and internships are definitely a better use of the summer than classes if you're able to secure one, otherwise your resume is going to look a little lean when you're a new and early graduate, especially if your GPA isn't too hot either...)",

I highly commend you for pulling through and getting your degree done so quickly, I honestly look up to that.\n\nThe funny thing is, after this semester and the fall (where I'm taking 14 credits), I'm planning on taking a similar amount of credits for my last 2 semesters if everything pans out (12.5 per semester, just a little more because I have to get my phys eds knocked out which is also the reason 2.5 years is my minimum).\n\nBut in the end, my primary motivator for this is indeed financial reasons. While I'm lucky to have a scholarship that enables me to be here, my current situation which I won't dive into kinda forces me to get my degree as soon as I can.\n\nI do have to admit I have internships on my mind, but so far each one that I was interested in for this summer has fallen through. If I do end up getting one though, I'll probably end up splitting my summer semester whereas I'd still take Statistics and Linear Algebra this summer (because I can handle that part-time and they're prereqs for some CS electives) but wait to take Diff Eq and Phys 2 until the next (since they don't affect my degree path at all). \n\nAgain, I appreciate your input since it gives a very realistic and relevant insight as to what I'm trying to do.

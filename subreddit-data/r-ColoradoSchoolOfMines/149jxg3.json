    "postText": "We were originally the Mines Housing Hub, and collected around 35 students by word of mouth to meet to form housing groups. Now that the housing group period has ended, and I see that there are a few students on this subreddit looking for roommates, I thought that I would post a link here.\n\nCheck out the introduction section to get to know other students, and get verified to join the weekly hangout sessions before school begins. I am doing my best to keep things as formal as possible, but also am trying to get to know other students as a freshman myself, so feel free to dm me, or just come to a weekly hangout and i'll be there.\n\n[https://discord.gg/myzaXGxSQv](https://discord.gg/myzaXGxSQv)",

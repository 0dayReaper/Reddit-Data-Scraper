    "postText": "I'm an incoming CS Major this Fall and looking at different places, such as DiggerNet, I've found my estimated graduation to be December 2026. While I understand a degree can take more than 4 years at times, an estimated graduation date 5.5 years after the first semester starts seems a bit odd to me. Is this accurate and/or common or should I have this date changed?",

Depends on how many credits you have coming in, but it\u2019s course requirements are relatively low compared to other majors",

    "postText": "I go to Periodic Table a few times a week, and sometimes I drop by wow cafe. However whenever i order chicken tenders or something like that they ask what kind of sauce I would like. I do like sauce but I don't know enough about each one, so I am hoping someone can recommend one to me. And many of them have unfamiliar names without a description. \n\nIt's been hard because I don't want to choose a sauce I don't like because then it will make the meal less adequate, dare I say ruin the whole meal. It's been a bit of a gamble lately because I want to try new ones so that I can find the superior. \n\nAlso I been nervous to ask, and I am wondering if I ask for one of each of the sauces, will they allow that? Then I could try each one and perhaps make a tier list for future reference. If not I may make many separate trips throughout the day and just ask for one type of sauce at a time without actually purchasing anything. Or will they catch on to that?\n\nSo far though, I am a fan of the Kansas City BBQ, and the honey mustard is pretty good. So I figured I would ask everyone else's favorite (and maybe least favorite) so I can come to a conclusion. Thanks.",

I ask for 2 or 3 of the ones I like then add them to my stash of sauces. So now I can pull out an emergency kansas bbq or something if necessary.",

Naturally I touched it.\n\nSuddenly I was in the center of a bustling medieval town. At the moment I knew: I had been summoned to a fantasy world as a hero to save the kingdom. Clearly an unexceptional fellow such as myself was perfect for the task.\n\nBefore I could wander the town and seek my fortune a lovely maiden approached me.\n\n\u201cYou seem to be a gentleman who has achieved mediocrity. Could you, perhaps, help me carry these baskets up to the palace?\u201d She spoke in a voice like honey. I of course could not turn down such a fair and voluptuous specimen in her time of need, so I complied and carried her cargo up the palace steps.\n\nAs I delivered her items a seedy looking chap at the palace gates solicited me. \u201cOh, this is dreadfully urgent business! You seem an average bloke. Have you any experience in the field of cooking?\u201d I replied that I was a decent enough chef and he grabbed me by the hand and dragged me to the kitchens. He informed me the royal chef had quit that afternoon and the king had not received his afternoon pasta.\n\nI protested that I had never served food to royalty before but he beckoned to proceed regardless. I began to panic and knocked pots and pans left and right. I had never made pasta from scratch before!\n\n\u201cDo it or face the executioner!!\u201d The seedy man bellowed.\n\nAfter nearly an hour of frenzied work I had a dish that would hopefully be presentable to His Majesty. I swiftly brought a large plate out to the Great Hall where the king sat awaiting his meal. I watched nervously as he wrapped the noodles around his fork and took a large bite.\n\nSuddenly he gasped and went into convulsions! He writhed around on the floor while his skin dried up like a raisin and then he crumbled into dust on the floor. Only then did I realize my fatal mistake.\n\n\u201cYou fool!\u201d The seedy man yelled. \u201cHow could you have forgotten the most important part of spaghetti?!\u201d\n\nThe entire royal guard burst through the doors with a unified warcry:\n\u201cYOU FORGOT THE SAUCE!\u201d",

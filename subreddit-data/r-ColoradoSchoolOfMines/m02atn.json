    "postText": "Hi all. I\u2019m considering transferring to Mines from CU. I\u2019m currently a sophomore at CU and was looking at the biochemistry department at Mines. I have never really fit in at CU, and I think I\u2019d fit in well at Mines. What\u2019s student like like at Mines? How are class sizes? Any insight into the differences between the two other than the obvious?",

            "comment": "Small classes are nice, although with your major CU has a much better reputation for it grads at the moment.  CU seems to be a more causal experience, Mines will be hard core.  Students are alright, people talk about the gender gap we have here, but it isn't a problem if you can talk to girls as over a third of our boys can't even get that far.",

            "comment": "my usual answer when someone asks this is the student life is gonna be what you make of it. basically, you'll be able to make friends and find a place among others without much difficulty, at least in my opinion. I don't know a ton about boulder, but im guessing you maybe didn't fit in due to a difference in lifestyle as a stem major compared with the other kids at boulder. one great thing about mines is that all your peers share your struggles, so if you can find a few who also share your interests, you'll make some great friends.",

            "comment": "I did Biochem for undergrad - there were 11 of us and we basically all had the exact same schedule because they only offer classes once a year so everyone takes them. I imagine that\u2019s different then CU, where you might have more flexibility in your schedule. Also, I wish someone had told me an undergrad degree (even from Mines) in biochemistry is basically only good for being a lab tech or pre-med so I\u2019d see if any of the profs will take you as an undergraduate assistant so you can get lab experience if you want to do graduate school. That\u2019s something Mines will have over CU too, almost every student was able to work with a professor.",

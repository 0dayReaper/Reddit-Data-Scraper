The thing about mines and engineers in general which you\u2019ll come to notice later on is that majority of them are not sober if they have the chance. There\u2019s plenty of social life at Mines it\u2019s just not high key raving and more low key house parties",

First year was easy to be social, they basically force you to meet other freshmen and you're living in a dorm so that's really fun. Joined a bunch of clubs too, made lots of friends. Second year I was in mines park apartments and we really got to know all our neighbors and had them over all the time. Constant friends coming over and frequent small house parties. Then 3rd year I joined a frat and my social life became so full I had to cut some things out. And settling into my major and making a small group of great friends in my classes, who I'm still friends with today. It was the most social time of my life by far and just an incredible experience.\n\nOf course there were shut-ins too. You can always avoid people if you don't want to make friends, or just game and study. But yeah I had no problem at all making friends and being social, simply living at a college and going to classes and joining clubs gives such a huge opportunity for social life and making lifelong friends.",

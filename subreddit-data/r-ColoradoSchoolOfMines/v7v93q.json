If you have an extra spot in your garage this weekend or next week I\u2019d love to pay to use it for the day, probably 8-10 hours. Have my own tools just need a legal place to set up that\u2019s not in the direct sun. Won\u2019t be working with oil or anything that can spill just electrical stuff",

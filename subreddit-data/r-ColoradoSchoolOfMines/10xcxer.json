Already lost my opportunities during Covid. GPA is too shit for most employers. Sick of all this stupid gatekeeping from these low level freshman classes. \n\n\nI guess I\u2019m not cut out for engineering",

Eventually got one in May, after finals, and only because I was their second choice and whoever they originally hired dipped last minute. So you never know. if you apply to enough places, you'll eventually stick in someone's memory even if you aren't the best candidate. Also, you could try taking some freshman classes at red rocks or smth.",

Job hunting sucks even with the solid skillset you get from a Mines education, but once you manage to find something, your experience will matter so much more than your college GPA.\n\nAll I can say is hang in there. I did, and after some trial and error, managed to find a job that is a great fit for me. Really hoping you can find the same.",

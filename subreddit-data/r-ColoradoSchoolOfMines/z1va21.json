    "postText": "Are you stuck on campus with no plans for Thanksgiving? Want to hang out with dogs and cats and fight a food coma? Do you believe Die Hard is a Christmas movie? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you're invited to join my family for Thanksgiving!\n\nI'm a grad student in the Comp Sci department, and I know how hard this time of year can be. Instead of stressing about all the end of semester stuff, come on over  and eat too much food with us! We make enough food to feed an army, and spend the day playing board games and watching the Die Hard franchise on repeat. Send me a DM and I'll send you all the details.",

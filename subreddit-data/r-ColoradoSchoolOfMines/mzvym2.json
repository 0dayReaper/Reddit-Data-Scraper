    "postText": "  Hello, I\u2019m an incoming freshman for the fall 2021 term. I\u2019m planning to major in Engineering Physics. Studying physics is really appealing to me, but as Mines is dominantly an engineering school it does me me wonder how reputable the Physics Department is. How does E-P compare to other majors at Mines? How does this major compare to a standard physics degree? Would you recommend this path? Any insight into the department, coursework, or major would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

            "comment": "I mean we are essentially one of the best E-Phys programs in the country according to my knowledge, problem is that employers don't understand the difference between E-Phys and normal physics degrees. At most schools physics is clumped into the \"arts and sciences\", meaning it's not really a technical degree. E-Phys is accredited by ABET and we do a lot of hands-on, working with electronics and lab equipment. Our degree doesn't just teach us the math and how to solve the physics but we also do design work and build experiments. I personally love the Phys department, it's pretty laid back, great faculty and a lot of ongoing research you can get involved with as an undergrad. If you know you want to do Engineering and you like Physics, I would encourage you to do E-Phys as the 4+1 masters are also great. \n\nLike I said in the other post, you should email Dr. Vince Kuo, you can find his email on the department website, he's a teaching professor in the department. I'm sure he can do a better job with a lot of these questions than me.\n\nEdit: if you like doing hands-on physics, this degree program is great. If you like theoretical physics and don't want to work with equipment or electronics, a normal physics degree somewhere else might suit you better. (It's all up to preference)",

                    "comment": "Strong agreement with the sentiment there that if you go for engineering physics, do the 4+1. And dont do what i did 11 years ago and keep changing which +1 you go for until you screw up and cant do it in just 1 anymore. I opted to walk away with the BS only, because i was tired of school, and I made it work and have had a great career, but it was a hell of a lot harder than it needed to be if i had just stuck with a +1 that worked.\n\nSaying that... really wish Mines did something with systems engineering, as I would have loved that to have been the +1 and probably would have stuck with it.",

As others have said, the 4+1 is a great program, and having a Masters in something other than Physics can really help you in the job market. It isn\u2019t that you \u201cneed\u201d it to be successful, but most companies are hesitant to hire straight Physics. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ColoradoSchoolOfMines/comments/mx3i3d/physics_engineering_education_quality_at_mines/gvm3mu8",

You can walk to several foothills hiking trails and I think a few climbing spots (not a climber), and Golden is as close to the mountains as you can get without actually being in the mountains - tons of great access within an hour's drive.\n\nI can't comment on the mainline sustainability stuff, but we're just down the street from NREL.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a grad student that works at NREL doing solar cell research. Here\u2019s what I hope will be some useful advice for the kind of work you want to get into. If you want to be an engineer working on something technical like solar cell manufacturing or the power grid, your best bet is to pick a traditional engineering program (electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, materials science, really whatever fits the thing you want to do the best) and get really good at the fundamentals. It\u2019s not super useful to employers if you do a broad degree that samples topics related to renewable energy without deeply developing technical skills. If you want to do policy, a broad degree can be useful. Environmental engineering is mostly related to water; don\u2019t fall into the trap of picking it because of the name. If you want to do water related stuff, it\u2019s a great major. There\u2019s all sorts of renewable energy research happening at Mines and in collaboration with NREL, so talking to professors at Mines to help you understand what your options are will be really helpful. Also, you\u2019ll have an easier time at most getting an internship at NREL if you are at mines (still is hard and you need to get your grades up), which is the one of the best places in the world for renewable energy research.",

Every weekend you gotta get up at 5 or risk sucking the I70 dick. When there's a pow day it becomes an actual hazard - too many non snow drivers on the roads, it's legitimately dangerous both on I70 or the passes to eldora or winter park. For skiing specifically better colleges would be Montana or Utah state (montana has a great engineering program). Utah's got similar problems but at least SLC has a much smaller population than Denver and the resorts are more spread out rather than having everyone drive west from Denver.\n\nI don't even know if you ski but that's synonymous with mountain access for me so that's my two cents.",

                                    "comment": "My sister goes to Montana State and I go here. There are basically two ways to think about it. Montana state has a resort called Bridger bowl ~20-30min away I would say and big sky a little over an hour. Bridger bowl is the most convenient option you will have at almost any school, but it\u2019s pretty small. I\u2019ve been there 3 times and by the second day you\u2019re repeating a lot of runs. Big sky is a bit bigger. So the convenience is there, but the diversity is not. \n\nFrom Golden on the other hand, you have crazy diversity. Obviously depending on traffic since I-70 can get nasty, you have several huge resorts within 1-1.5 hours. You get Loveland, keystone, breck, winter park, copper, and A basin all within 1.5 hour drive (though you usually plan for at least 2 for traffic if you can only do weekends). Nothing 30 minutes close, but you get a ton of huge parks in a congested area. So one Epic or Ikon pass and you will never get tired of it. Another note, I\u2019m a morning person so I never minded getting up really early for skiing, but tons of people despise the traffic. Kinda depends how you are. \n\nBoth schools are some of the best for skiing. It\u2019s a matter of if you value a bunch of options with much larger parks a little bit further away, or that quick convenience if maybe your classes end in the morning and can do a quick half day. \n\nFor hiking, both are fantastic. I generally prefer Golden to Bozeman just because you can get into dense forests with good altitude hikes a lot easier since we are basically kissing the Rockies. Got tons of state parks and rocky mtn national nearby. For fall colors, CO &gt;&gt; MT imo. Idk if you\u2019ve visited Bozeman yet, but Bozeman as a town is actually pretty flat. It kinda sits in a valley of sorts, so you don\u2019t get immediate hiking options (like walking literally from your classes), but obviously going any short distance towards Yellowstone gets you some gorgeous ones. Hope this helps in that regard.",

I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard all about the social life here, and it\u2019s partially true. There definitely is a fun, outgoing social part of the school, but you really have to look/work for it.

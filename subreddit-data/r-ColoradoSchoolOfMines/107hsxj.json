Our household is working on where our Freshman will live next year, and maaaaaybe just owning something for 3 years might be an approachable route.  Looking for input on what it might be like to call that area home.",

We're all just a bunch of poors here; that sub is where you'll find the land owners. \n\nSeparately, I would consider going for the dorms; especially freshman year. This can be a *very* lonely school, and it seems like most friend groups are formed in the dorms during first year.",

            "comment": "My info is several years out of date, so take it with a grain of salt.\n\n306 isn't so much hard as it is time consuming and tedious. Group projects can be draining, especially if you have to pull teammates with you. If everyone is pulling their own weight, it's not so bad. There are lots of small projects and several things due in a given week, so it's just a lot to manage. Nothing like real software engineering from my 4+ years of experience (spanning from the associate to the staff level).\n\n341 is somewhat rigorous, but if you're not familiar with low level details of computers, the material can be hard to grok at first. Just keep studying and grinding and you'll do fine in this class. Reading the textbook is actually really useful to understanding the concepts.",

It does slowly ramp up in workload, so you have time to get up to speed with Java before the workload gets more intense. \n\nYou have two languages you\u2019re comfortable with, a third will be easier to learn. You got this!",

It come and goes for me, but it never really goes away.\n\nNo one will ever look at you funny if you ask questions to try to better understand and be on the same page. You should always feel free to do that. When I switched jobs last year, I probably stunted my onboarding because I was too nervous to ask questions. When I finally broke through it, things went better. It's never easy to sort through imposter syndrome, but those of us who tend to be good at what we do have the worst cases of it.",

The MIPS assembly programming assignments can be daunting at first--mainly due to the low-level nature of the language itself--so I always recommend you give yourself ample time to get acquainted &amp; hit some of the inevitable pitfalls early... it gets a lot less scary with a bit of practice, I promise :)\n\nFeel free to shoot me a message if you have any specific questions!",

            "comment": "306: My biggest piece of advice would be to find a time you and your partner can consistently meet to work on the project. If you don't need it some weeks, great, but it's good to have it set aside, especially during the second half of the term (Clue project).  The coding isn't super hard, and it's not supposed to be. This is a class on test-driven development and how to work with a partner, not on coding. \n\n341: Get ready to learn how things work at the tiny level. It's hard to grok for a lot of people and it can be hell if you don't, but it's also super interesting and programming in assembly is a cool thing to know! \n\nIf you end up enjoying 341, see if you can take CSCI 410!  It's not always offered, but you build an entire computer from nothing but the most basic boolean circuit: a NAND gate!",

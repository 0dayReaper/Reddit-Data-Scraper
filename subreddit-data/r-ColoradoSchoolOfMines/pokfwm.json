Ever since Mines shifted, I am unable to have my Mines Outlook and RRCC Outlook open in the same browser. I have tried clearing cache and cookies and calling the IT departments of both schools. The only \"fix\" any of them offered is to have two separate browsers open, which is a complete pain in the ass (especially since one of them is MS Edge \ud83e\udd2e). I also like how they removed the option of auto-forwarding Mines emails to an outside account under the guise of making things \"more secure\". Great job Mines ITS! \ud83d\ude44",

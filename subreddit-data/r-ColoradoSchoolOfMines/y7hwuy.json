    "postText": "Hey y'all. Midterms can be really terrifying, and you may think your life hinges on a test but it truly doesn't. I'm personally one of those people where the more stressed I get the less productive I actually am, and I know there's a decent number of people who can relate to that. So just calm down, get SLEEP (multiple studies have proven that sleep is the highest predictor of academic success so stop those all-nighters), take a breath, and do your best.\n\nThe thing that always makes me feel better is that if I try my best in preparing then I can just accept the outcome of the test. If I studied and I worked hard, then whatever I get on the exam is the best I was going to get, and thus I might as well accept it and move forward. You are all going to do fine and I guarantee one semester from now you will not remember a single one of these midterms. This is just a tiny blip in your life.\n\nWish you all the best on these upcoming midterms and let's all keep each other motivated through the end of the semester.   \n:)",

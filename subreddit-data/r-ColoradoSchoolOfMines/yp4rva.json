    "postText": "As an alumni, I recently was put in a situation where I needed to report a struggling friend to Mines SOS due to large mental health concerns.  \nThis was done with their knowledge as they had already reported themself, and my report was to add additional urgency to the situation.  \n\n\nMines SOS is one of the first resources Mines provides for reporting students that are in some sort of crisis.  \n\n\nYou would think that Mines would be quick to respond and assist a student struggling with suicidal thoughts!  \n\n\nThe report was returned with a case manager emailing my friend, asking to set up a meeting over call or zoom. My friend responded  \nasking to meet as soon as possible, and no response has in over 24 hours. I had also sent a personal follow-up to please  \nmeet with my friend.  \n\n\nOn further investigation, I found that the mines SOS team is comprised of two directors and a SINGLE case manager.  \n\n\nOnly ONE case manager is responsible for getting back to students in dangerous mental health conditions.  \n\n\nI googled the case managers' name, and found their socials, which I was able to confirm with a tattoo present in their  \nimage on the SOS team page on the mines website. On their socials, they have been happily posting on their stories instead  \nof responding to a potentially dangerous situation.  \n\n\nWhy doesn't Mines have more then one case worker for SOS? Why is this team comprised of three people total?  \n\n\nIt is clear that mines barely funds this program, what is even the point?  \n\n\nMines should prioritize it's huge mental health issues over expanding and making more money. PCJ (what does he even do)  \nshould have his salary reduced and that money should be placed into these crisis prevention systems.\n\nIf Mines SOS isn't the way to go, what even are the proper channels?",

You can't get through one session without them firmly telling you that you won't be talking to them again and that you should get a \"real\" counseling at full counseling price. You can kind of force another couple sessions, but the amount of time they spend on you as opposed to insisting that you don't come back goes up like crazy. Especially frustrating when it's a relatively small problem that could be worked through in less than a whole session, but if it isn't specifically school related, they don't care.",

I made a project because I felt that way, if you feel it might help your friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[diggingdeeperatmines.wordpress.com](https://diggingdeeperatmines.wordpress.com)",

Thinking about it, two years worth of credits at Mines is over 70 credits. I don't know, but it seems tough for a high schooler to rack up that many credits, let alone 70+ credits that Mines will actually accept. Unless you did dual enrollment at a community college or something like that, but in that case, you may be considered a transfer. What major are you going for?",

Even if they don't accept all of your credits, it would still save you a lot regardless.",

One or two Econ classes. Two gyms. One or two ethics/humanities classes. A group \u201cengineering\u201d project class.

I've been able to reduce my overall course load in the time I've spent at Mines, usually taking about 15 credits a semester instead of having a bunch of 18 credit semesters, which has been really nice and allowed me to not do school 24/7. The only thing I would say to be careful about is what Mines will let you transfer in for credit, as some classes will transfer for Mines classes, but some will also come in as general \"Free\" elective credit, of which you only need 3 to graduate, at least for MechE's.",

I found it to be a pain to flip through notes on a screen, and using it to reference for homework I got frustrated (such tiny reading area).  I would endorse it if you have a dual monitor set up where you can have your class notes on the monitors while you work on your tablet.  Also if taking notes on a tablet, buy the best stylus you can, the cheap ones will just make you get a new one within a month.",

As far as just taking notes, I think it's alright; I use onenote probably 1-2 hours a day. Just takes some practice, some customizing, and you can get it like 70-80% of the way there to a working solution.\n\nHaving spent the whole spring and a bit of summer trying to find a combo that worked, I guess I can just recommend that you're better off buying for the physical aspects of the device than the software, and go from there. Specifically, make sure you buy something that is bright enough to read, and that has a nice, functional pen that doesn't feel like trash, with enough buttons you don't need a bluetooth keyboard. The rest is details IMHO",

My favorite app is notability because you can backup your notes to pretty much any cloud service. There\u2019s also options to submit PDFs directly to canvas from the app. Someone mentioned flipping through notes was difficult but you can split screen to view 2 notes at once in notability or with the iPad you can split between 2 apps. I haven\u2019t used paper for the last two or three semesters! It\u2019s an investment but if you are tech savvy you may like it :)",

It made organizing and finding notes much more effective and efficient, and when professors inevitably went too quickly, I could just snap a picture of the board and keep up instead of languishing a few sentences behind the instructor. \n\nI'm done with coursework, but I would never go back to pen and paper again",

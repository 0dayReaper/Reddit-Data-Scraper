This should be after all grading curves are applied.\n\nI'll start things off with CSCI442 Operating Systems at 60.6\n\nDo you have a class which beats that? Please post it!!\n\nEdit: final exam grade. Not final grade.",

At least Dr. Morrish actually cares about teaching quality and the success of her students; but that can't make up for shitty instructional design. I wouldn't have passed ChE Thermo without attending every one of her office hour sessions. Somehow I always left Ely's office hours--when he actually bothered to show up for them--knowing less than I did prior.\n\nSp14's PChem was the cherry on the cake. Under Ely's \"leadership\", he tried to make up for shitty instructional design by doubling down on shitty in PChem the next semester.\n\nPChem taught by the Chemistry dept was totally fine. Still very challenging; but fair; and I learned a lot.\n\nI avoided anything Ely like it was the plague after that. I have zero respect for that creature; unbelievably smart as it is; it is a shitty human being. Not just unhelpful, but antihelpful. I'm done now.

I gave the \"pure chem-e\" career-track a chance, and I had some fun but it just didn't turn into what I wanted.\n\nIn school, I really wanted controls to work out. I feel like most people hated that class, but I think it might've been my favorite. I just couldn't find the right opportunity in the field at the right moment to launch a career in it. Just seems that all the jobs in controls are 90% travel and that doesn't really work with my life situation.\n\nI found a startup that does machine-learning/AI process control systems. Not sure if they'll ever really find their way into heavy chemical process industry because neural-network model control is a way of explicitly acknowledging that we don't know what's going on in the process, but we have a statistical model that makes hopefully good predictions before critical failures happen. Can't learn from failure if failure = explosive death. I'd love to be a fly on the wall in the HAZOP meeting when AI model-control is proposed.\n\nReally cool stuff.",

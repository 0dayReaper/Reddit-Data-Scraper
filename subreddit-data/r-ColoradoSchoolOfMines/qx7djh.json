            "comment": "Used to be a TA, graduated last May: do ALL of the final exam review questions on LON-CAPA! Do them more than once with different numbers if you have to! Traditionally, most of the questions are pulled from that pool. If this set of problems isn\u2019t up yet, simply revisit the exam review questions from each topic, those are great too!\n\nBeyond that, take a look through your old exams for problems you missed. Occasionally we will take the most missed problems from their respective exams and toss them in the final as well. As far as optics are concerned, that changes usually depending on who the coordinator is. I would generally expect about ~5 questions on the topic, spanning from studio/HW problems as well as the review set. Best of luck to you, remember that it\u2019s only an exam and that you will be just fine no matter what happens!!!\n\nAlso, feel free to DM me if you have any further questions. I\u2019d be happy to help!",

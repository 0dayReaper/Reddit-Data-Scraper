    "postText": "Anyone frustrated at the lack of spots in CEEN 314? I tried to get a spot, but apparently Mines thought it was okay to only have 30 spots! It also seems to be a prereq for a lot of the structural classes I wanted to take and now it seems I won't be able to take them if I want to graduate on time. Anyone had this issue in the past who found a decent solution?",

Check for spots after drop date, after finals week, and a few weeks before the semester starts. (also email the prof but someone else already suggested it)",

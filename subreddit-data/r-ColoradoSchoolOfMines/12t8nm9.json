Beyond that, extras would just be for you (if you want to play games or something). When you need to do something heavy like solid works or training a neural network, most people have to use the lab PCs or remote into one of the super computers anyway.\n\nEdit: Having an HDMI port (or something that can convert to one) might come in handy as well",

There are plenty of computer labs you can use for solidworks, but sometimes its nice to be able to run it on your laptop; those newer cpus have integrated graphics that can do some modeling. Also an HDMI port is nice to have, or at a minimum a USB-C port with an adapter to HDMI.",

Or you can be a cool kid and roll into class running Gentoo or something, but you probably wouldn't be asking this question if that's you ;)\n\nIf you want to have Solidworks on your laptop, make sure you meet the [System Requirements](https://www.solidworks.com/support/system-requirements). But there's also several computer labs on campus that have it for you, so you can do your homework there. Unless things have changed, one of them is in CTLM, which is where a lot of freshman classes are anyways. So you can knock out your solidworks homework there.\n\nOther than that, there isn't a ton of \"intense engineering software\" you'll need to run on your own. Maybe Matlab or Mathematica, but those don't have very stringent system reqs. The *real* intense stuff, you'll probably not need until your junior year, and you'll be using that in your major's computer lab rather than on your own computer.\n\nIf you have Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer, and a web browser, you're set.",

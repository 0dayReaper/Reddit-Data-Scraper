    "postText": "Hello all, I am currently a transfer student that will be arriving at Mines this coming spring semester. I will be taking 15.5 credit hours and one of my classes will be CSCI 101. I was considering dropping it at Mines and taking it at Red Rock (CSC 119), to allow myself a more \"diverse\" and a potentially easier first semester load since it is a pretty difficult school. Does anyone have any insight on this, such whether or not to worry about about CSCI 101, any good profs to be on the look out for at Red Rock when it comes to this class, or just whether or not it is transferrable (I believe it is, I am not entirely sure about it though)? From the looks of it, it appears CSCI 101 is just another massive class taught by the TA's and overlooked by one particular teacher, like a lab. If anyone could give some insight into the class as well and its structure that would be sweet. This class seems to be very different from the programming class I took at my current university a year ago.",

Like others have said, it's a waste of time. \n\nA particular point is that 101 assumes you know python programming already and doesn't really go over that. 102 is the class/lab that does that instead. CSC119 actually taught me how to program so take that info as you will.",

I still wholeheartedly recommend you transfer in since, again, 101 is a waste of time (and frankly, a lot of money).",

    "postText": "The calendar says that the 6-week summer session goes through Friday, June 23rd. I was looking to plan a trip starting that Thursday, but I'm not sure if that type of overlap would be allowed. In prior summer classes I've noticed that most have their finals a few days before the \"last day of classes\" so would it be presumptuous of me to plan a trip starting that Thursday?",

            "comment": "What happens on the last days of com sci field session is that everyone has to present their final project/watch other's final projects. So if the class is scheduled to go until those days, there's a good chance the last two days will be presenting the final project (which u definitely can't skip if you want to pass the course).\nThe time each group presents is dependent on when the \"clients\" have time to watch so they probably won't change scheduling so you can go on ur trip unfortunately.",

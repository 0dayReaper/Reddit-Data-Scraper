    "postText": "My son was interested in attending Mines. When they visited Mines, his Dad, a fan of gear, bought him a Mines sweatshirt, long sleeve technical fabric Mines shirt and a technical fabric Mines polo. My son is 6\u201d4\u2019 and 220 and the gear is all XL. It\u2019s barely worn and from a non-smoking home. \nI\u2019d rather give the items to students than donate them.  If you\u2019d like one of the items, please let me know and I\u2019ll send it to you.",

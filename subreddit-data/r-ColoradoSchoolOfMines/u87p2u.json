    "postText": "Hi!\n\nWe are a group of exchange students (4 males) looking for and apartment that could accommodate all of us at a reasonable price, do any of you have any recommendations? We are willing to pay around $1000 each. \n\nWe'll only be at mines for the fall semester so we're looking for a short lease term. availability has been a big issue for us as almost all units that fit our criteria are unavailable. \n\nThanks in advance.",

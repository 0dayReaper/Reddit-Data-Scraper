    "postText": "My junior daughter is interested in Mines as well as running. She doesn\u2019t think she is fast enough to walk on: 2:33 / 800, 65 / 400. 5k: mid 21. Very low mileage program. Are these times too slow for the program? She doesn\u2019t want to contact the coach unless she knows there is a chance she could walk on.",

The team has gotten significantly better since then, especially on the women's side.\n\nIt wouldn't hurt at all to reach out to Chris Siemers, the head coach. You can find his email on the Mines athletics website. He is sometimes awful at responding to emails, I had to email him 6 times before I finally got my first response from him. But he's still a very nice guy and if your daughter wants to know if she has a chance, she should definitely reach out.\n\nI'm not on the team anymore so I don't have much knowledge about what's going on. But based on those times, there's definitely a chance of her walking on, especially if she lowers that 5k time in cross country season. Good luck!",

That should help give an idea of what a freshman is expected to run, and how their times can improve over their collegiate career. \n\nAnecdotally, I walked onto the women's track team with a 2:28 / 800 and 57 / 400 and was cut after my sophomore year. Not meant to discourage! I would suggest reaching out anyway, you never know! A lot can happy in your daughter's final HS seasons. Scott Van Sickle is the middle distance coach for the Mines track team.",

Even if your times aren\u2019t good enough now, showing improvement and consistency over your last few seasons is a good sign to them. Also, the coach isn\u2019t very responsive by email so keep at it if you don\u2019t hear anything!",

            "comment": "I walked on in 2004 for xc and track. I didn't score at regionals or nationals, but I did train with the men and women that did. I did improve enough to run at the conference meet several times. In case you're not aware, the men's xc team is the best in D2, and the women are a top 3 team in D2. This has been the case for roughly the last decade. This also translates to the track and field teams, which are both top 10. When I was on the team, they never cut athletes. But the slackers, or people who needed to commit more to school or other things, naturally were weeded out.\n\nSure, i know several men and women that were recruited for their athletic and academic accomplishments, but I also know lots of men and women that were walk ons. Some never made a state meet in high school, but with good coaching and training, they became nationals-level runners and All-americans. \n\nYour kids high school performances are good indicators of future abilities, but I wouldn't let that hold your kid back. Also, for high school age men and women, they mostly all tend to do the low mileage programs. This is good while they are still maturing, but you often don't know their true abilities. \n\nI would recommend reaching out directly to the head coach, Chris Seimers.",

I was told 3 days before signing day that I no longer had a spot on the team. Granted I wasn\u2019t super fast and it\u2019s an incredibly competitive team. Idk if my times will help, but some of my best ones were(all at 6000ish feet): 2:02 800, 9:58 3200, and 4:37 1600. I was also league champion for 5k in cross country.",

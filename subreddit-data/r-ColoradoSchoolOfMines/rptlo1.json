    "postText": "I was doing some degree planning and it looks like I can graduate in a fall semester for winter commencement. I can max out my hours to have it easy that last semester, however, the catch is that it would have to be part time given I won't have enough credits left in my degree to go full time.\n\nMy question is how does graduating in the fall look, especially for financial aid? I heard that all that usually happens is that your aid for the spring half of the academic year is forfeited, but I don't know if taking it part time solely to complete your degree would impact it as usual. Would your aid not be renewed for taking your semester part-time, or would mercy be granted given it is your last semester?\n\nThought I'd mention: I could re-arrange my plan so that the fall semester I'd be graduating can be full-time, but I thought I'd ask if that would impact my aid before doing so. I would love to have a lax semester especially given that the classes I would take would be my most intense, but if my aid that allows me here in the first place would vanish because of it, I'd rather go full-time and distribute my classes more evenly, it'd be lax anyway.",

I know some scholarships/grants require full time. Again, best to call the finaid office",

            "comment": "In addition to the ramifications of graduating a semester early, you should investigate whether you have a minimum # of credit-hours to keep your financial aid status.\n\nYou kind of need the stars to align just right (or wrong, rather) but sometimes taking 1 fewer credit-hour can make the semester *more* expensive if you lose a scholarship over it. So you might want to take a chill PA class or something to keep yourself full-time.",

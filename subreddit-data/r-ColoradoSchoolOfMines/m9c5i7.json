Mines definitely looks good, but you need to do more than that. \n\nThe other thing Mines doesn't tell you is that while Mines looks good, other schools look good too. If you apply to a job and the other candidate was a Boulder grad with the same GPA and resume, you both still have about the same chance. Don't let Mines fool you, having Mines on your resume isn't gonna give you a huge edge over other schools\n\nEdit for background: This is coming from a recent ME grad, and I graduated with a 3.7-4.0 GPA",

I'd expect a CS student from Boulder would probably be on a level playing field.  Underground construction and tunneling... not so much.  MechE isn't so much of a Mines specialty compared to mining, MME, UCT, etc.\n\nBut, yes, you do get what you put in.  Mines is helpful on that front though, by really encouraging professional development and internships and stuff.  The place I transferred from wasn't nearly as aggressive about it; I barely heard about career fair there, for example, and if they had an equivalent to that career booklet thing (with help on resumes, interviews, etc) they weren't noisy about it.",

I came in with a lot of AP credits and the assignments that they give in entry level classes are made way too difficult for the content they are teaching.\n\nWe also have a mentality of industry, industry, industry. The school targets itself more than I think they should to a \"get an internship and get a high paying job and make lots of money with the skills we will drill into you\" mentality.\n\nLike: I am a physics major, and we have a great if not the best student-faculty ratio at mines. I really enjoy talking with the professors and they are very nice and overly willing to help you out if you need it. I don't think this can be said about other majors though, as they have a lot of different culture and different availability of professors and teachers.",

This results in a very high stress environment causing countless mental breakdowns among students. That sparked  the rumor that Mines has the highest suicide rate in Colorado, or even in the USA depending on who you ask (I can't find a statistic). \n\nThe school does have extensive mental health programs now, but that's one well known downside. \n\nThe upside is future career success, and a really good chance you'll have a job right out of college. \n\nThat's really all I can say though, any other Pros and Cons depends on your personal goals and needs.",

Everyone has a similar amount of hard work to do and no one was in a major where it looks more fun and seems easier (communications, poli sci, etc). Those majors are hard in their own way and I wouldn\u2019t succeed in them, but they also often go with lots of free time and socializing and partying where engineering typically doesn\u2019t. The comradery  at Mines is motivating and encouraging and something I missed at a bigger more diverse academically school. \n\nThe social life you have to build up more for yourself, but I don\u2019t know anyone that didn\u2019t have a social life they enjoyed and regrets going to Mines.",

And limited non-engineering electives \n\n-very male, very white, very straight. There are more diverse communities but it\u2019s limited. \n\n-limited support for students seeking grad school or any post graduation options other than a traditional job in industry. \n\n-historically there\u2019s been a very toxic culture that depression is good and if you aren\u2019t crying and losing sleep over classes you are weak. After many suicides they\u2019ve finally been making roads toward being more supportive toward student mental health but the counseling department is still deeply underfunded and there are still problems there. \n\n-maybe the classes are harder. Mines students love to talk about how about how much harder mines classes are than any other school. I\u2019ve never been to another school but tbh I don\u2019t really buy it. I thought IB classes in highschool were harder than 95% of my mines classes. \n\n-higher average after-aid price than most other schools (though mines would argue they make up for this with how high their graduates are paid with one of the highest ROIs out there, which is true)",

The work is tough, but it's not artificially difficult--and, coming in as a transfer student, I appreciate that it's not artificially easy either.\n\nThe major con is that all of those points seem to be major-dependent.  Some majors are notorious for having a toxic culture and unnecessarily difficult coursework.  They're still a great education (as far as I know), but it's a lot less pleasant.\n\nEdit: another major, and more general, con.  The freshman/sophomore-level gateway courses are brutal and not necessarily all that necessary.  The physics and chem sequences were my toughest coursework until I got to senior-level structural engineering classes.  For Physics I that was helpful down the line, but I've never touched on Physics II (E&amp;M) since and only made modest use of chemistry.  A lot of civils get to run into the same issue again down the line with dynamics, which most of us don't really have any use for.",

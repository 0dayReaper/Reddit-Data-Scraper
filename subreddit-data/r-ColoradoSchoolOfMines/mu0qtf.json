It is also important to consider those that are reflecting on their experiences if they are currently in school or graduated and looking back.",

            "comment": "I probably have the least conventional Mines experience. I came from a family with no money, took a gap year because I didn't know if I wanted to go to Mines or art school, got into Mines with no scholarships, lived with crippling anxiety without realizing for the entire 6-year undergrad experience, failed a few classes, worked part time to full time for 5/6 of the time there.\n\nBut I made some of my best, lifelong friends, I learned how to think, I learned humility, and I learned some really cool math along the way. I'd suggest Mines to anyone, with the reminder that you don't have to suffer. If you find yourself acting differently in a way that you don't feel comfortable with and holds you back, reach out for counseling immediately. I probably could have graduated on time if I knew what anxiety felt and looked like. From what I understand, the school has done a lot in terms of academic and mental health support services since I graduated.",

I\u2019m torn between Mines, which is fairly expensive for my means, and a full ride to a mediocre-ish college near my home. I just know that most people who attend the college near me really hate the campus life and quality of education, and I don\u2019t want to suffer through my college experience.",

I'm super in debt from Mines (not salty about it, I make great money but haven't highly prioritized paying my debt down), despite having had in-state tuition, but remember that I was a poor, underachieving super senior. If you're already in Colorado, Red Rocks Community College has plenty of students who plan to transfer to Mines, but aren't there yet, for various reasons.\n\nIf not being in debt is most important (I'll tell you, it wouldn't be for me), take the full ride. The choice is ultimately yours, so be honest with yourself, do the best you can, and don't worry about what anybody else thinks about your decision.",

The majority of them also don't care if you learn, just grades.\n\nI think the major problem with the school is that a lot don't have meaningful industry experience, and those that do tend to actually care.\n\nMines sets you up for the future by making the school harder than most anything you will ever encounter in industry. Unfortunately, it's by making you do stupid things that don't matter.\n\nI know grads that have been asked to work a little overtime, and their boss worries that they will want to leave. But even that overtime is so much less than a light week at Mines.\n\nOn top of all that, the administration won't help you. I and others I know have tried to get improvements made around campus, even going to faculty that should be willing to help, and gotten nowhere. I've been told multiple times that the menial amount of work it would be for them is too much.",

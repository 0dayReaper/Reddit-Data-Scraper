Proximity to the rigs in the DJ is great. Absolutely hated chemistry and calculus courses we had to take. Barely passed them but excelled in the petroleum courses. Field sessions were awesome. Internships were hard to get with a GPA below like 3.2 so work hard. Met my wife there which was totally unexpected. Glad I did because I was close to failing out. She was from Colorado so we spent a lot of time away from campus.\n\nI worked overseas right out of college and was shocked by the reputation the Petroleum Engineering department had abroad. Pretty cool when you are offshore in the North Sea and a guy from Aberdeen had heard of your college. The alumni network is pretty awesome. Found out we were relocating to West Texas and reached out to a six alumni out here. All six replied and helped us get settled which was great. One got me a new job.\n\nFeel free to reach out. I am the alumni leader for our area",

In the case of an industry crash or if you end up wanting to do something different, mechanical will give you options. I work right alongside engineers without petroleum degrees and nobody notices or cares once you\u2019re in the workforce.",

                    "comment": "This should be the #1 comment.\n\nIf you want to go into petroleum but have the work ethic to succeed in mechanical engineering, do yourself a favor and get your degree in mechanical. Not only will you not pigeonhole yourself, you will learn valuable skills that you can apply to your job in the petroleum industry that are not necessarily taught to the petroleum engineers. Also, you might find that you like a different industry more than petroleum, which you can then easily pivot to because you won\u2019t have to change your major.\n\nMany of my petroleum engineering friends eventually got tired of the industry and living in middle-of-nowhere Texas. They then wanted to switch industries and come back to the Denver area. They then found it EXTREMELY hard to find a job in a different industry even though they had had stellar resumes along with leadership experience. It was all because their experience was deemed non-applicable. They have told me that they wish they actually thought about their degree selection and didn\u2019t just go with the degree with the highest starting salary.\n\nI have one friend that did his degree in mechanical and went into the oil/gas industry. He had a pretty easy time finding a job after school and integrated quickly and seamlessly with the petroleum engineers on his team.\n\nTLDR - if you get your degree in mechanical engineering, you will have an easier time transferring to other industries like petroleum. This is not the case if going from petroleum to other industries.",

            "comment": "To add onto /u/claire303's comment: A lot of people are swayed by the stats the school puts out about the average starting salary of each major. This *really* depends more on the *industry* than the student's major. A MechE working on an oil rig will be making pretty similar salary compared to a PetroE, but has more options to pivot their career if they want to make a life change a few years down the line (which happens to almost everybody).\n\nI'm a huge proponent of learning as many fundamental skills as possible that make it easier and faster to pick up trade-specific skills. *Every* job is going to have training specific to its role that you'll never learn in college. The better your fundamentals, the faster you can get through that and onto more impactful roles at your company.",

    "postText": "I'm aware this may be a dumb question. I'm currently a cc student planning to transfer soon. I know Mines is an engineering school, so I'm wondering if the engineering physics major would still provide a relevant base for someone who wants to be a theoretical physicist or if CU Boulder's physics department would be a better fit. From what I can tell, I think I'd prefer the overall environment of Mines to Boulder, which is why I'm considering it; I don't really like the feel of large flagship schools. But, obviously, academic fit is most important to me.",

            "comment": "Mines does some pretty cutting-edge stuff in the Physics department. If I\u2019m not mistaken Dr.Wiencke is leading some projects on high energy cosmic waves and back tracking their trajectories to find what could have created them out in the universe. There is also so cool stuff with feptosecond lasers that I couldn\u2019t quite understand during a talk I attended. I know EPhys majors that have worked on components of those research projects as their senior design project. Definitely can see a route into theoretically from projects like this.\n\nIf you are looking for a contact that would helpful for the theoretical side of things at Mines I would recommend you contact Dr. Laith Haddad. He was a great professor and he is very interested in the theoretical side of things from what I know.\n\nAlso, it is undergraduate physics major so you will learn everything that an physics major anywhere else would learn, its really up to what you do and who you talk to after that.\n\nGeneral relativity and particle physics are offered to undergrads if that is a draw at all.\n\nMines is definitely the place to go for physics majors if you want the community. The EPhys community is one of the tightest on campus and we have a whole lounge and everyone knows everybody. Something I personally think you cannot get at boulder. Our Society of Physics students chapter has gotten many awards for this stuff.

            "comment": "I think it's also worth mentioning that to actually do theoretical physics you pretty much have to go to grad school anyways. The Mines Eng Phys degree will prepare you well for that, but I'd definitely be looking at other schools grad programs if I were going that route. In fact a few of the people that were in my cohort have gone on to do more theoretical physics based PhDs, all at different schools. \n\nI've glanced at the Boulder undergrad physics degree requirements before and from what I could tell the curriculum was pretty similar to the Mines curriculum. Either will get you into good grad programs if you do well. The only thing that would push Boulder over the edge is if you could find a professor there you knew you absolutely wanted to do research with, so definitely take a look through Boulder's staff and see what their recent papers have been (I'd reccomended doing the same for Mines).",

I do know that Mines is a Research School, and they encourage you to dive deeper into your major(by getting a graduate degree) and to pursue research in your preferred area.",

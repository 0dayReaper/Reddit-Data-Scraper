    "postText": "Hello. \n\nCurrent high school student here wondering if I should apply to Colorado Mines. Reading about the university, it seems like it would be a great fit for me in terms of cultures, etc. However, I noticed that there is no general or pure mathematics major, only an applied math and stats major. \n\nI want to go into mathematics. I don't know exactly what I want to do, whether I want to go applied or pure. However, I very much want to go into a research position, whether that be in academia or industry. I'm leaning towards potentially doing research in the intersection between CS and math, though I still don't know. Given this, is it worth getting an applied math degree? Would it hurt my chances of getting into grad school if I decide to go into the pure math route?\n\nMy other issue is the number of advanced math courses offered. I'm taking calc II as a sophomore, and assuming I follow my planned courses throughout HS I'll have Calc I-III, Diff eq, and linear algebra done before going to college. Would I be able to find more math courses at Colorado Mines or would I quickly run out and be left with a lot of other electives? Does Colorado Mines allow undergrads to take grad level courses?  \n\nThanks.",

Sprinkle is a good guy, we were friendly back when he was a student. \n\nStudying applied math isn\u2019t lesser than pure math; you\u2019ll get your foundation in logic and formal proofs that you\u2019d need in a pure math environment.",

            "comment": "I'm an applied math major at mines and I will say, first and foremost, this is not the place to go if you're interested in pure math. The pure math courses are extremely limited. As for their applied math, however, I have great things to say.\n\nResearch opportunities are abundant and the professors are awesome. The department is incredible and that's a large reason why I ended up studying math here. Mines is also very career focused and there are a lot of opportunities in that regard.\n\nAs for advanced math courses, there are plenty. I was in a similar boat as you minus diffy q coming in, and I'm currently a sophomore and have taken 3 grad math courses, and I know someone who took a grad math class as a freshman.\n\nI'm not that knowledgeable about grad school admissions, but I'm pretty sure you'd be fine getting into a pure math program out of mines. If you take advanced courses and do research I'm sure you'll be fine, but it would obviously be better to do pure math more before a pure math grad program.\n\nAll in all, the mines applied math program is amazing, highly recommend it, can't say enough good things about it. but if there's a decent chance you'll want to do pure math, go somewhere else. Mines is not the place to do pure math, period.",

            "comment": "First off, going pure math won't hurt your chances at getting into good graduate schools, regardless of where you decide to go for your undergrad. Graduate schools often take candidates with undergrad degrees in semi related or even unrelated fields; they're looking for the right person, you'll get all the catch up education you need and or want during the program. Pure math also sets you up with good foundational knowledge and problem solving skills for a lot of different science and engineering fields. If you want to get into research you're looking at a PhD, and to be honest once you have that no one is gonna care what your undergrad is in or who it's from. \n\nThat being said, many a high school student has entered college with plans for a PhD, but decided after 4 years that they're sick and tired of school. A pure math bachelor's can often not look quite as attractive to employers if that's your only credential. It by no means makes you unemployable, but it can be less of a plus on your resume than say a mechanical engineering bachelor's. To be clear, this isn't because the degree is less rigorous or prestigious but because the pure math undergrad will have less immediately useful skills to an employer than an engineering degree would. \n\nTo go back to my original point about graduate schools being less concerned about your bachelor's degree, it may be worth considering doing an engineering or computer science program for your undergrad, then getting into pure math in grad school. Engineering and CS will both set you up with the skills you need to continue into a pure math graduate program, while also giving you the flexibility to enter industry immediately if you decide you're not interested in continuing your education down the line. Something to consider, from someone who was practically obligated to get a master's after my math undergrad. \n\nThere's a lot of math courses at mines, you won't run out. The classes you mentioned are really just the tip of the iceberg. The department will expect you to have those done before you start any math major specific classes. Almost all grad classes at mines also have an undergrad equivalent class, often taught at the same time in the same room. The work load is the only difference.",

I received my first degree from Mines in math and the majority of my job options were for jobs that required a degree, but not a specific degree. I ended up in entry-level support &amp; QA for a mid-cap software company. It was so boring.\n\nAfter working a few years I realized I was unhappy with my career trajectory and ended up back at Mines for a geophysics bachelors and masters. That opened so many more doors.\n\nMy math degree is no more than a footnote on my resume now. Get an undergrad degree in something with \"engineer\" in the title and minor in math so you build connections to the department. If you still want to get a PhD in math then continue on. If your GPA is high enough you'll be fine.",

A lot of it is theoretical, using theorems to write proofs, or using code to model mathematical things like differential equations. Applied math and stats major is broken up into computational emphasis or statistics emphasis. The computational one is more \"pure\" math in the ways mentioned and is sort of a cross between CS and pure math. There are a lot of math electives, but i found some of the pure math ones like abstract algebra to be brutal. I also took a grad course as an undergrad when I didn't have any other options.",

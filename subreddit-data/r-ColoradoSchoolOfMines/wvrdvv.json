You could get 40 meals a semester for around $450, but if you run out you can purchase more.   \n\n\nWhen I started in 2017, the dorm meal plans was unlimited for a certain price, so paying a high price means you can enter and exit every hour if you really wanted to.   \n\n\nDoesn't help that Sodexo is one of the worst food services. I heard even CU Boulder is 10x better cafeteria wise.",

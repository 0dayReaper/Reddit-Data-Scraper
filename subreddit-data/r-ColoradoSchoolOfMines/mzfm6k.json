    "postText": "yo, i really really want to get into school of mines but worried my gpa and rank aren\u2019t gonna cut it. i got a 1350 on my sat, but only have a 3.7 weighted gpa, and am 600/950 class rank. (even tho i go to a fairly competitive and educated school). i\u2019m already a junior, but do you guys think i have a shot at acceptance? is there anything i can do in particular that would help give me a boost?",

I feel it\u2019s easier to get accepted coming from a cc, more affordable, and likely not as difficult.",

You\u2019re in the average admittance range, but for what you lack in GPA you might want to make up for in SAT or ACT. My GPA was I believe around a 3.7(?) but I took the SAT 3 times and went from a 1400 to a 1560. Might be worth it to get that score up, but you\u2019re not below the means of acceptance imo",

As someone else mentioned, you might consider taking the SAT or ACT again to boost your score, but you also have time to strengthen your involvement in extracurriculars and stuff you're passionate about your senior year",

Ask to meet specifically with admissions director when there.

Let your passion shine through and you\u2019ll be Golden.... pun intended",

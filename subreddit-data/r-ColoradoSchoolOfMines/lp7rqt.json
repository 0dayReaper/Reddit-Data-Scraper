    "postText": "I saw it hit the news today about students spending more time than every before. I wanted to do a poll of current mines students to figure out how much time we have been spending. For me it definitely feels like there's more homework than time in the day so I want to compair with others to see how they feel. \n\nhttp://www.strawpoll.me/42677049/r\n\nThank you so much and have a fantastic day my freinds.",

In my Machine Learning class and Cyber Physical Systems Security class, no. It's worth noting that I haven't actually done anything for the second two classes that involved implementing something. They're both extremely theoretical at the moment and all the work I'm doing is just based off of slides and lecture.",

Projects and Essays obviously add to this, with tests adding a good hour per night for studying. All in all, I probably spend 1.25-1.5 hours on homework for every hour in class when averaged across a semester... I've definitely felt an increase with COVID, though more so last semester than this one.",

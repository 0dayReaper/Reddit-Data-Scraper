I'm aware of the Mineslist and CSM Housing Facebook groups, although currently there aren't many posts for housing in the fall. When should I expect posts like that to start appearing?\n\nAlso, if by any chance anyone is looking for a roommate for next fall, be sure to let me know.",

You can do a general apartment search to find something in budget and apply for it as if you were not in school. I've had the most success renting homes from rental companies and apartments through leasing agencies.",

We are currently working through issues with them that are preventing full service.\n\nThe EasyMile engineers have been fine tuning to the best of their ability, but we currently only have two shuttles that are running well enough to operate. One of those must be used for training, and the other doesn't have the battery life to run all day alone.\n\nUntil we have at least three shuttles ready to operate, we will not be running routes. EasyMile has told us that we should be good by the end of the week, but I wouldn't get your hopes up.",

If the whole route is 10 minutes, knowing it's coming sometime in the next 10 minutes or so doesn't tell me anything useful--I'm not going to stand around for 5 minutes to avoid walking a mile.",

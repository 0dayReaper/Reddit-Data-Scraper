Mine was because I had great metrics for everything except for my ACT score. I wrote a letter to them, and flew out to CO to have an appointment with the advisor and gave them a pitch as to why Mines was my dream school.\n\nNot saying you need to do what I did - but at least maybe find out who is in charge of your application and maybe pry out if them why you were waitlisted. You could ask a question like \u201cI understand I am being waitlisted for X, and I would like to know what I can do from now until the deadline to make you change your mind\u201d or something like that. They might really see your dedication and change their minds, or make a deal with you.",

Not sure why I didn't get in, maybe my essays weren't that good. Maybe one of my teachers wrote me a horrible recommendation haha. I would be curious to find out why I didn't get in though",

Wouldn\u2019t recommend it because I lost tons of social opportunities from not being here for fall of freshman year, but if you want to do it they will let you in. Probably makes more sense to do cc first, get your core classes out of the way and come in as a junior or just commit to somewhere else. When I met with the admissions guy in 2019 they said it\u2019s pretty much impossible to get in for freshman fall off the waitlist, and it feels like the  class sizes are only getting bigger so I wouldn\u2019t get your hopes up too high.",

I didn\u2019t get in out of high school, went to community college with actual adults (I find most freshman here insufferable), saved a ton of money, and did well there + did some relevant charity projects, work and tutoring. Let\u2019s be honest, calculus, basic physics/chem and statics is gonna be the same no matter where you go so you might as well not spend tens of thousands to take those classes. Good luck!",

The thing that doesn't make sense to me is that I got a scholarship as well? Why would I have gotten waitlisted if they were willing to give me a scholarship? I'll take it though. I'm still going to wait for my other decisions to come back, but the likelihood that I'll go to Mines is high. Thanks for the help everyone!",

You may be granted work study if you\u2019re below a income level, and that opens up a lot of positions in food, service, admin, etc. on campus. If not, some departments have budget for those without work study, so you could be doing something admin or front desk related. Your best bet could be TA-ing, because that would be more in your subject area and should pay decent.\n\nedit: also if you have an interest/hobby like photography or working out, they have media roles and you can get certified as a personal trainer. Additionally, if you have a car you can look elsewhere in Golden and neighboring towns for part-time jobs that may pay better.",

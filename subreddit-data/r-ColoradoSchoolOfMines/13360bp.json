    "postText": "I have been looking at zipcar for my kid to use to visit friends at CU - Boulder.  The school website says it has zipcars on campus, but when I look at zipcar online, it does not show anything on the map.  Can anyone confirm if Zipcar is still active on the Mines campus?  Or is there another way to quickly and economically get from Mines to Boulder without a car?\n\nThanks!",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I just found out today that I was waitlisted at CSM after applying in mid December with the Golden Admission App. I applied as a female out-of-state Petroleum Engineering major, had a 1560 SAT, a 98.2/100 UW GPA (on the higher end between 3.95-4.0) at my county's Magnet engineering school, National Merit finalist, and some other STEM-y activities/awards. I was wondering if anyone had guidelines as to what may have gone wrong with my application, as I thought getting the Golden Admission App email was a good sign. Was it my major--I know Petroleum Engineering is super competitive? Or because I didn't demonstrate enough interest--in addition to not really demonstrating interest, instead of writing a Why Mines essay I put in one of my own because it gave you that option. Or because I applied after Nov 1? I totally get that none of y'all are in the admissions office, but if anyone has any guidance based on trends they've seen, it would be really helpful! CSM was one of my top choices and now I'm super scared for the rest of the admissions cycle.",

            "comment": "Current sophomore here. When I first applied to mines out of high school for freshman admission, I knew absolutely nothing about rolling admissions, so I thought, \u201cI\u2019ll just wait a few more weeks and polish up my application before submitting it\u201d. I ended up waiting until just a few days before the deadline, and as a result, I was put on the waitlist in February. I emailed dozens of people, even went and visited mines and talked to admissions, and everyone was saying the same thing: when people apply, we look at their applications as they come in, and enough people applied that all the spots were taken. There\u2019s simply no room left. I had a good act score and completed the entire application thoroughly, but at this point none of that mattered anymore. \n\nNot knowing about this was easily the biggest mistake of my life, and is still my biggest regret to this day. Had I submitted my application before it was \u201cperfect\u201d and not procrastinated to the last minute, I\u2019m sure I would have gotten in as a freshman. Instead, I never got off the waitlist and had to attend my second choice school for the fall semester, and apply as a transfer student. Luckily I was admitted halfway through my freshman year and started as a transfer for the spring semester. But of course it had to be Spring 2020, so I only got to stay for 2 months before being sent home for covid. This basically meant I didn\u2019t get to meet anyone or get to know anybody for my entire freshman year, and I\u2019m now approaching my junior year feeling like a complete isolated stranger at this school.\n\nSo bottom line is, if you\u2019re on the waitlist, you\u2019re most likely not getting off it, and if you still cling onto mines like your life depends on it, you might end up in a similar situation. I\u2019ve transferred schools 7 times in my life and I can easily say that transferring to mines was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done, and my experience will never be the same as if I was admitted as a freshman. Maybe it\u2019s possible to transfer and do okay, but that wasn\u2019t my experience and I don\u2019t recommend it.",

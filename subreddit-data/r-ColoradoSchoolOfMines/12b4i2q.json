    "postText": "For anyone that has taken the Comp Sci field session in the summer, what are the typical hours like in a week? Geode says 8-5 but I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re actually working all day, every day on it. \n\nAnd for anyone that took it in the fall semester, what was your experience with workload and time spent on it? Thank you!",

            "comment": "This is my experience last year so not sure how helpful this will be, but it really depends on the group and ur client. If ur client doesn't have their stuff together, sometimes u don't even do much of anything client related for a week or two. Or you're immediately thrown into working like 9-5 tops. \nThat's the client side of things. Then there's the class portion. This was I believe once a week for a couple hours where they have guest speakers to talk about the \"real work com sci experience\". And also some cool stuff related to doing com sci out of college. There's also a proper lecture where they teach u agile, how to work as a team, ethics, etc. U also have to meet with ur assigned professor once a week to talk about ur client/project and also turn in projects/do mini presentations for a grade.\n\nTldr: depends. But u will have a lecture that's like 3ish hours a week, 1 hour of assigned teacher time, then the rest of the time is for talking to ur client, doing ur project, and doing the assignments/presentation stuff for class. Some teams had crazy projects so worked 9-5 most days, some teams only worked like 10 hours a week tops cuz their client wouldn't get back to them or their project was easy.",

            "comment": "I took it in the fall. Workload is average but it largely depends on what project you have. If your project is easy you can do it all very quickly and have a lot of time leftover. If you choose a more difficult project your workload will much higher. The projects range from simple coding applications to complex research and development projects. My group choose a more complex project and we agreed we definitely could not of finished it if it were a summer field session.",

You are not guaranteed to get your choices but they are taken into account. You can also decided if you want to try and select a teammate of your choice instead of a project.",

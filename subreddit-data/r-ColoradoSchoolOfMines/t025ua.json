            "comment": "I'm a PhD student in the QBE program. My understanding is that the graduate program has existed for a while and they created the undergraduate QBE program this year. I can only speak for my experience in the graduate program. \n\nThe graduate QBE program was created as an interdisciplinary program at Mines for students interested in Bio research. Because of that, the graduate QBE program has a lot of flexibility and we're allowed to work with labs in multiple departments: I'm with the chemical engineering department, but some of my classmates work with labs in the Chemistry, Math and Material science departments. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the program, it's mostly up to you and your advisor to pick classes that will complement and help in your research, which I appreciate, because my interests are very varied and I'm not bound to just take electives in my head department.\n\nThe downside of it being an interdisciplinary and new program is that it doesn't have its own building. Its mostly headed by the Interdisciplinary program office of the Graduate Studies office, which is in Alderson Hall 4th floor. This means that we don't have a dedicated staff that can guide us in case we have questions. Some faculty are appointed as Program heads and these faculty are also our professors for our core classes, so that's convenient because I can ask program questions after class. \n\nAdditionally, the department is trying to create some cohesion by organizing weekly talks and inviting speakers from other schools and departments to talk about their bio oriented research. That's a good opportunity to meet other people in our program.\n\nHowever, the fact that they don't have a dedicated program space and staff would have make it very hard for me if I had been an undergraduate in QBE. I did my undergraduate in Biomedical engineering and Chemical engineering at Hopkins. The reason I chose Hopkins for undergrad was because they were very flexible in allowing you to explore all your course options, so I jumped around between majors. Because I was constantly switching, I needed a lot of mentorship and guidance from my department heads, staff and advisors to basically tell me the pros and cons of choosing one major over the other. Thus, I benefitted immensely from having a dedicated program space, activities and bonding opportunities. Now that I'm in grad school, I don't need that that much since most of my development is dependent on my lab and my PI is the one that guides me in my class selections.\n\nI personally like that since I can choose my classes, I'm given the freedom to take more Econ oriented courses, programming courses, etc. That would have been very hard with a larger core curriculum. \n\nMy recommendation for you is to ask yourself what you want out of the program and what works best for you. If you're someone who needs a lot of structure, then maybe the QBE program isn't the best fit because it's just starting and they're still laying the groundwork about its direction. However, if you're someone like me whose research is very niche and who would benefit from customizing the program a lot, then it would make a good fit.",

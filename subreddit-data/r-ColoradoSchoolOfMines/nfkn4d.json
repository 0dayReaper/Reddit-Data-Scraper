Congrats on the housing!\n\nI personally wouldn't keep the rooms so empty, but it's a strong stylistic choice at the very least!\n\nEdit: just realized this is supposed to go with another text post... Just edit the original post with a link to the images? Making an entirely separate post made it look like this was a standalone post on my front page. I thought this was just a weird mistake, no wonder I was confused.",

You need to register but then you can park in their parking lot overnight. Free WiFi is provided with the help of a local ISP and there are showers and storage in the building you can access. While not monitored Golden PD does say they keep an extra eye on the space.\n\nhttps://goldenfirstumc.org/news-more/home-in-golden/",

I don't know rules in Golden about that but I've seen vans there parked for multiple weeks with people constantly near/in them. Mines doesn't allow camping in campus parking lots but I honestly don't know how strictly they enforce that over the summer.",

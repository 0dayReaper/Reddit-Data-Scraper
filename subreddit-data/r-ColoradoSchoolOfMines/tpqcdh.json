Some of them are mainly lecture based but even then it\u2019s in a relatively small room where it is still easy to ask questions or get help as needed. Other classes that have you working on stuff in class will be smaller or have TAs roaming about to help.",

There's so much material to be covered in each class that class time is mostly for lecturing. Professors do answer any questions when you have them in class as well. The personal help really comes from office hours because there's no time in class no matter the size. Obviously project based classes are different but you're talking only about 10 of those through your 4 years. No joke, sit closer to the front of the room and it will feel like a smaller classroom. It's entirely what you make of it. If you want a collaborative environment, than make it happen by talking about the lecture with your neighbors in class and going to office hours when your confused.",

    "postText": "Hey everybody,\n\nOne of our roommates is moving out, and we're looking for someone new. I would post this on Mines List but I don't have facebook.\n\nIt's a 4 bedroom, 2 bath house in Lakewood, about a 12 minute drive from campus. There are three of us staying: we're all guys, 2 of us Comp Sci, 1 Stats major. I wouldn't say we're tidy, but we aren't slobs, and generally try to keep the place clean. We're open to anyone, if you like to play basketball, tennis - there are nearby courts, or video games that's a plus. League of Legends players need not apply. In general we're all good friends, pretty chill, and try to be respectful of each other. We'll be signing here for another year.  Rent is a bit less than $750, which includes high speed internet. We have parking and in-unit laundry. The house is decently spacious and we have a great kitchen.\n\nIf you're interested or know someone who might be, dm me or reply to this post so we can meet.\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know, happy to answer!",

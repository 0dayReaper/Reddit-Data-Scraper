As an undergrad, I transferred here and, since I hadn't taken the lab, my Physics I didn't transfer and I had to retake it.  The first time was at a standard state university.\n\nThe topics covered were nominally the same, but Mines physics was far more rigorous (in an appropriate and useful way).  For example, when Mines says calculus-based physics, they mean actively using calculus to solve problems.  When [previous university] said calculus-based physics, they meant using calculus to derive the kinematic equations, and then using those for everything (which means exclusively problems that can be solved with the kinematic equations, e.g. constant acceleration, etc).  Mines requires you to understand the physics, not just be able to guess which equation to use.",

            "comment": "I obviously can't speak with certainty but I can think of two things that I've been told that illustrate Mines being different curriculum-wise. (This is from a civil/structural perspective obviously)\n\nNumber 1: Theory above all else. The professors were very dead set on not teaching core classes on things like CAD. The argument was that you could go to any technical college and learn that same stuff. They also prioritized the math and physics of things way more than the codes. I think other schools give you more on the code books, cause you use them in your career. \n\nNumber 2: diverse content. Up until like 2010 the degree people got at Mines was a general engineering degree with a focus in mechanical engineering or what have you. Students in electrical, say, still had to take X number of life science classes. This is sort of strange, and other schools don't do that. We all get our actual selective degrees now, but there's some legacy to this train of thought. It encourages a more well rounded engineer. But tbh I'm still bitter I had to take circuits and a MechE fluids.",

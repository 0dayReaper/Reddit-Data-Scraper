            "comment": "First, get the option with less munch money. There's no reason to pay for them to hold your snack cash hostage. \n\nSecond, consider how often you eat out, and how much variety you demand in your food. Mines Market food has decent variety (especially if you eat more than grillworks and pasta) but it still manages to feel pretty samey. I had no issues with that and happily got full value out of the 21 meal per week plan. If you are going to want to go out to eat frequently and/or are ok missing a couple meals per week, the 14 meal plan may be a better option. If you're unsure, I do recommend the 21 meal plan, being able to just get food when you're hungry is quite nice, esp. if you're overwhelmed.",

There's no reason to get more munch money as it is 1:1 with USD and the on-campus convenience store that accepts it will price gouge you. There is a 14/week option but it only saves you $65 PER SEMESTER for 5 less meals per week.",

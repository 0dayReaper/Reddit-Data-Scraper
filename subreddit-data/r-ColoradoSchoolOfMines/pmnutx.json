    "postText": "Okay so Mines is kind of like my top choice right now but I\u2019ve been reading posts on here that are making me doubt my thoughts. \nI\u2019ve read that the MechE and CS department is like meh. And like I know about the work hard die harder culture but god is it only mines or...?\nAnd like why do you guys sound miserable? I know that everything we learn in college is pretty much like 90-95% useless in the real world but is my education like gonna degrade or some shit? Am I better off looking at other places?\nALSO how\u2019s double majoring here? I\u2019m thinking of CS and MechE (because I\u2019m stupid and can\u2019t pick) I know of the tour guides double majored in em.. I forgot his name tho\nI suffer with imposter syndrome every once in a while pretty badly so at least I\u2019ll make a couple of friends through that LMAO.\n\nI\u2019m going to be attending the Mines Discover Event.. so that\u2019s that. Any questions I should ask to get the most out of experience? \n\nI mean my bad, I\u2019m a naive high school senior if you can\u2019t already tell.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve received a ton of words and advice and such and I am very grateful all of it! Thank you guys!! Had to take a break from replying bc it\u2019s homework time haha\nThank you for also correcting what I\u2019ve gotten from diving too far into the subreddit. It doesn\u2019t help that it was 2 in the morning almost LMAO thanks once again!",

I really love it here, and it hasn't been too bad for me, and most people I've talked to are doing really well if you can stay organized and not procrastinate. If I was in your shoes, I would pick Mines over a different school if:\n\n1. You know for certain you want to study STEM but have no idea specifically what discipline you want to go into. That was probably the biggest thing for me. Mines really gives you the chance to explore all your options before you declare your major. I came in as a comp sci, switched to physics, and then switched to math before finally declaring. For a lot of other schools, it's going to be really hard to switch majors, especially in engineering.\n\n2. You would rather go to a small school than a big one. Going to a small school gives you more chances to make friends and connections, and it makes getting into classes a lot easier. I know people who are struggling to get into their intro classes and it's ruining their chances of graduating on time.\n\n3. The location is also really, really nice. You're literally against the mountains and it's a 20 minute drive to Denver and a 30 minute drive to Boulder, both of which have a lot of fun stuff to do. The sun is usually out and it rarely snows an insane amount.\n\nThat being said, it's not going to be the \"typical\" big-school college experience. Mines only guarantees housing for your first year (maybe 2 years?), there's only 1 dining hall with pretty average food, the sports games aren't too exciting, there's a 2:1 gender ratio and campus is pretty tiny. Golden is also definitely not a college town, it's more of a town with a college in it. But if you're a real nerd about STEM and you're in-state, there's not going to be a better choice than Mines. Hope this helps!",

And the pedigree you get graduating from mines vs other schools (especially if you do a mines specific thing like geology/chemical/geophysics) you will be set for employment. I did civil and went into underground construction and the mines pedigree was big. In general, employers know you handled a ton of work and got it done, and can learn adapt to any aptitude in the work place. TLDR.

Why do people sound miserable? Genuinely, some people are. That's a by-product of going to a challenging school, you'll find similar mentalities at MIT and CalTech too. I am not miserable, but some people are, and frankly, the ability to complain bonds people together, so there is a bit of that here.\n\nI wouldn't say you're \"better off\" looking at other places, I would encourage you to look at a broad range of schools, and then decide which one you want to go to. It's a very personal decision, so Mines might not be the right school, but I wouldn't necessarily discount it based off what other people say about it.\n\nMy biggest recommendation is to talk to other people at Mines Discover, and see if it is the type of people you want to spend 4 years around. Keep in mind that a lot of people who go to the event don't go to Mines, but I would listen to your gut and see how Mines makes you feel.",

I personally didn't challenge myself in high school and my mental health set me at a disadvantage. I had to relearn a lot of the calculus skills and classes were much more fast paced than in high school. If you're one of those people who enjoys math and/or has tutored in the past, the rigor wont be hard.  It's taken me about two years to finally figure out how to be successful here and I still feel like an outcast at times. \n\nIf you make friends/allies and don't try to do things on your own its alright. I have a few other struggles just by being on the spectrum and not understanding some aspects of relationships with other people as well. If I can do it, you can too. It's not necessarily guaranteed you'll be miserable, but it does take a lot of work to be happy/healthy. \n\nI wouldn't expect to graduate with a double major in 4 years. Be prepared for setbacks, but you can likely get it in 5 maybe six if you're dedicated. I guess what I'm saying is don't set yourself up for failure with super high expectations. \n\nI wrote the e-book that's pinned on the top of the subreddit. If you want to learn more about the \"recipe for success\" that I learned the hard way. Go there.",

Engineering is generally tough at almost every university around the country, and I wouldn't say Mines is necessarily harder than others. But it all depends on your mindset and what you want to get out of school. Like others have stayed, I would not go in trying to double major.

CS is a lot of repetitive grunt work that in some classes (data structures, algos) it will be useful repetition but other classes it\u2019s a waste. You won\u2019t use 50% of the math you need to take unfortunately (only use basic integrals, simple ODEs and some matrix stuff) As for teachers and their willingness to help: I haven\u2019t had a single teacher who wasn\u2019t willing to go the extra mile to help me understand a concept if I shot them a quick email. Work ethic is going to be your biggest takeaway from mines by and far.

Mines is very tough (speaking as a transfer student; I've got a direct comparison), so students do tend to be under more stress than elsewhere.\n\nIt's a lot better if you put forth the effort to have a good social life and hobbies.  It's more work up front, but it makes everything easier and more fun when you have a constructive way to relax, people you trust to do group work with, etc.  I think a lot of the miserable people probably have somewhat deficient social circles, because my friends definitely made my experience.\n\nI'm not really familiar with double majoring, but it's a tough push as it is to graduate in 4 years here, so I'd be inclined towards a minor instead unless you have a very good reason.  The extra time is probably better spent on internships or research.\n\n&gt; I know that everything we learn in college is pretty much like 90-95% useless in the real world but is my education like gonna degrade or some shit?\n\nFrom what I've heard from industry folks and experienced in internships, this is... overstated.  You're not going to be doing the exact work you learned, that's true.  That doesn't make it worthless: the point is to learn (1) crucial background for good professional judgment and (2) how to learn quickly.  At least in civil engineering, Mines is great for both--and, since it tends to be more applied than theoretical, I've actually directly applied a lot of what I learned even as an intern.",

I have taken exactly one CS class in my life, but I write a lot of code and I'm the semi-official programmer for my research group.  It might not be application development or other \"serious\" programming (although I've done a good bit of that for work too), but it seems most everyone benefits from being a halfway-competent R programmer these days, at least in my field (for data analysis, mostly).  I also use R to make figures and such for class.\n\nProgramming is also a lot friendlier to a limited formal background than most fields, since it's mostly more of a craft than an engineering discipline.  I need to be comfortable with a lot of physical principles to do hydrology work, but I get by just fine with no formal background in algorithms.",

I wouldn\u2019t plan on finishing a double major in 4 years though, but you\u2019ll have time to figure out what you want to do once you get here. if you get here. \n\nfor the love of your mental heath do not do chem e",

I\u2019ve found that I don\u2019t really make friends in classes unless someone is super extroverted and makes a point to talk to me. I made a few good friends in field session because we were all going through hell together, but otherwise I\u2019ve mostly met people in McBride, the Mines Green Team, and as an editor for the arts journal. I\u2019ve noticed that if you get involved with a few different organizations, you\u2019ll find other people that do the same. \n\nIf you\u2019re not looking to get thaaat into Mines, I\u2019d suggest joining some other clubs (or PA classes) based on your interests rather than the school. I recently met a bunch of really cool people through the climbing club and a climbing class. \n\nOverall, don\u2019t get discouraged if you aren\u2019t really making friends in classes. It\u2019s an intense school and you won\u2019t have time to talk to people during class if you want to do well. You\u2019ll probably meet a bunch of people you don\u2019t really want to be friends with, but there are friends if you look :)\n\nOne more thing: I\u2019m a transfer student and never lived in student housing, and I believe people do develop some friend groups of people they live with. So you\u2019ll have that to look forward to as well!",

If it was the price of a more normal school it'd be more understandable, but for the price is unacceptable. \n\nI know multiple people that went to CU Boulder for engineering, their experience was much better. And they actually have had free time to enjoy their lives. I've heard similar things from friends that did engineering back in my home state as well. Its also much easier for them to find jobs as a comparable amount of work there accounts to a much higher GPA.\n\nYou asked about the usefulness of the education. Most of the MechE teachers don't have much if any real world experience. There have been multiple times where I've had to correct them on very simple tasks and terminology. In addition the majority of classes aren't really applied to anything in the real world, meaning that if you make it through you won't even be able to use that information. \n\nI know someone else mentioned that they went through the McBride program. Its a bit of a joke from what I know from people that went through it. They don't seem to actually get graded on the quality of their work, just if they did it. And then eventually improve throughout the semester.",

Mines is definitely a school where you have to work hard and be productive. But it is also a very collaborative school because everyone wants to succeed. What is also nice is that your first 2 years basically everyone is taking the same classes so there are always going to be people you can ask for help. \n\nI don't know much about any of the major departments because I am a QBE but I'm sure you already you responses from others on that.\n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to pm me!",

Used xps 13 or something similar is what I would do if I had my desktop here (or the MacBook Air is so temptingly cheap and performant but if you like windows obviously not lol)",

            "comment": "If you don't care about durability, I highly recommend the Dell Inspiron 15 5510. It's probably the best laptop out there for $750. It's got an i7 and 16 GB of RAM, but it's very lightweight. Should last your career. I've had the Inspiron 14 5410 (previous generation of this laptop) and short of some issues of physical damage (I am quite clumsy and have dropped it easily a dozen times) it is great. The new generation just has a newer processor.\n\nHere's the link. https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/inspiron-15-laptop/spd/inspiron-15-5510-laptop/nn5510fndts",

If it's from Dell, Acer, Asus or Lenovo you are good. If you don't need it right now just wait for back to school sales on dells site and get some killer savings. Best Buy also runs deals. Just watch out and if you can snag a 5700u, 16gb RAM, 512gb ssd, 1080p screen for under $700 I'd call that a really good deal. Don't go with less than that cause those specs will last you all of college.",

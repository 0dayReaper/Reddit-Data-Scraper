    "postText": "Hey all! As a recently accepted student who looks to continue their academic endeavors at CSM, I've opened my scope to some of the opportunities mines holds. I am curious to see and hear if anyone has any input on mining/geological engineering. What are the classes like? What job experiences have you guys had or heard of? What does the field look like? I find this major to sound interesting but as someone who has never been involved in mining I don't know what to expect. Any information would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Exact same experience as jcrocket. Got a job immediately after graduating as a geotech soil/concrete/asphalt tester. Long days in the field, sometimes shitty conditions. Sometimes boring, sometimes interesting. Local geotech firm. Not great pay. Got promoted into drilling, then eventually actual engineering after like 3 years of field tech work. Worked as staff engineer writing soils &amp; foundation reports for a few years, got more responsibilities, was a project manager in all but name. Got my PE, jumped ship, got a big pay raise to work for a city instead of private. Job security unless there's another 2008 style housing crash which seems unlikely. \n\nMy friends in Mining had a similar but different experience. They also did field work, but it was more like real geology. Mapping, scanning, surveying, drone imagery, logging long drill cores, 3D modeling of ore deposits. Then cad and slope software stuff to determine how steep you can make the sides of the mine, that kind of thing. \n\nThe miners would all have to live at the mine, or in some tiny town nearby. Elko Nevada was a popular place to live. Many would live in a trailer on site or in a shitty motel a short drive from the mine. Versus me, I didn't get paid nearly as much (the miners made bank) but I got to live in Denver and have a stable life, do all the city stuff, date and make relationships, etc. Mining sends you to where the mines are, civil engineering and geotech sends you to where the construction is, which is mostly in the city, where houses and apartments are being built. I'd say the mining is more interesting from a geologic standpoint but the geotech is more stable. Mining also fluctuates with the price of the commodity, like if the price of gold drops then the mine will shut down and everyone gets laid off.",

I had an easy transition into underground construction, and just got my civil PE.  I live in Washington DC and love what I do.   Cannot recommend the mining department enough.  They were really like a family to me.  It\u2019s a much smaller group and a lot of the major specific classes are very hands on and fun.  One of the classes is just physically working out at the experimental mine.   Survey, explosives, and the geology classes were also very field heavy.  My advice is to take the freshman Earth Science class to see if you are interested in mining/geology, and talk to the department at orientation events.",

            "comment": "I would say if you are unsure about what major you want that you just stay undecided for the first semester (unless you want to go into comp sci at all as you need to start those classes right away). By the end of the first semester most of the people who I know will have at least narrowed it down and there is no penalty for choosing your major by then. I also know people who came in wanting to do one thing and changed it almost immediately because they realized they loved or hated something",

            "comment": "Graduated in May 2022 with my BS in Mining Engineering.  Loved my professors and the department.  I got a job 6 months before graduating and I moved to the SW for work.  I am actually getting a raise and being transferred closer to home in March/April.  While what wastingtimeonreddit said can be true for mining peeps (and I know plenty of my former classmates working in Elko) It is dependent on what kind of mining you end up doing.  If you want adventure, go into hard rock/heavy metals.  Want more stability?  Go into aggregates/industrial minerals.  I chose aggregates and definitely do not regret my decision.  Regardless of what you decide on choosing, both are excellent career paths.  I would recommend touring both departments to help with your decision.  Best of luck!",

    "postText": "Sorry if this is not the place to ask, but im debating on going to Mines and a few other colleges and have been trying to find actual people to ask who may have been in a similar situation.  \nI have ADHD and it has caused a problem in school and such for me for a long time, ive been able to get by with decent grades and such, but its never been easy, and I dont want to put myself through another 4 years with basically no support (My schools have not been very supportive or helpful dispite me asking).  \nHas anyone on here gone through something similar or has ADHD that can comment on what kind of support they were given? How much do you have to fight for support? Is it expected that I deal with it all myself because college is more independent? I know Mines is a harder more challenging program, does this expectation mean that support is harder to get?  \nI'm hoping to learn more because I've been invited to the Mines Challenge Program, which might help me learn more about what kind of support id expect to get if I went to Mines.  \n(I'm probably going to do something like Computer Engineering, I don't know if that changes it but yeah)",

            "comment": "Mines is very supportive of students who need accommodations and there are plenty of other students with ADHD. However, Mines has a bit of love affair with a culture of suffering. The amount of busy work can make time management difficult. Start learning strategies now! I\u2019ve found that good time management systems and behavioral tricks are as, if not more, important than medication.",

This program will allow you to take intro to calc, chem, design, and a bunch of workshops that could be very helpful to you. The program is free and doesn't give you any credit for the classes, so even if you change your mind you can always pick another school (you might have to return the books though if you leave mid-program).\n\nSome of the classes you might have to take during the school year will have long lectures and labs. You can contact DSS (Disability and Support Services) if you need accommodations and can communicate with your professors as needed. Some might give you extensions, but others won't.",

Wasted effort.\n\nAlso, I have ADHD and nobody at that school gives a F about mental health lol. I was put on the wait-list to see a therapist and then they just never got back to me.  Pretty weak for a school with such a high suicide rate. \n\nAaand I had extra time on tests &amp; quizzes because of my ADHD... I had one professor who straight up refused to give extra time on quizzes. I failed all the quizzes and almost had to take an extra year. And then she got an award at the end of it lmao.",

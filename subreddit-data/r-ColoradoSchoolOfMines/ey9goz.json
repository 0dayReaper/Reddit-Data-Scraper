Half the tree branches hadn't yet lost their leaves, so they were heavier than usual under the snow load and cracking under the weight. Mines sent out an e-mail essentially saying \"we have heard reports of tree branches falling and hitting sidewalks or damaging cars. These branches are heavy and dangerous...so please be careful as you walk around campus today!\"\n\nNever change, Mines.",

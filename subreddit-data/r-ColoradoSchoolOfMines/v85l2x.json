Stay away from chrome books though\n\nIf you want to do some editing and stuff on your laptop, or play games, then you\u2019ll want more specific recommendations.",

The more you spend the nicer stuff you'll get but those 2 specs are probably the important ones. I splurged on a core i7 and it's nice to run lots of stuff at once but definitely could get by on a lot less. If I were buying a laptop right now I'd check out the M1 macbook airs (if you like mac os), any $700 - $1300 windows laptop (dell and lenovo are good places to start), or what would be even better is a 2 year old used workstation laptop from some business somewhere, you can get a $2500 laptop for like $1000 if you 'know a guy'",

I know they do their intro courses in Java I\u2019m fairly sure and there\u2019s thousands of students coming in with macs every year, so there is an extremely low chance that Mac isn\u2019t supported. And if not then there are a bunch of IDEs you can use instead. I\u2019d only be worried if I was going in using Linux.",

It\u2019s like a laptop and an iPad all in one so I\u2019m planning to take notes in OneNote on it.\n\nIf you\u2019re not worried about notes or games tho, I\u2019d say what other commenters said. Anything that\u2019s getting good battery life and has 16 gigs of ram should serve you great. Read/watch reviews to figure out battery life tho, don\u2019t go off the advert. And I\u2019d say make sure it can charge through usb c/thunderbolt. If money is tight, don\u2019t be afraid of \u201cused\u201d options. I got $600 off my laptop cuz someone put a scratch in it and didn\u2019t want it anymore. Thing works just like new tho",

Since Alienware computers are Dell, I'm pretty sure the Help Cemter in the CTLM can get a Dell Tech on site within a day if you got an extended warranty and your computer needs service.",

In CS, if you get into heavy machine learning stuff or open a lot of chrome tabs, this PC can do it all and more.\n\nGot this in my second semester as a freshman and it was worth it!\n\nThe only disadvantage is the battery life but I do not mind sacrificing power. You can always lower the power and increase the battery life.\n\nThe only reason I chose this over the mac book air/pro is that I needed power and the ability to customize my laptop. The air/pro is fragile, pricy with little or no advantages(other than being lightweight).\n\nThe only reason I chose this over the mac book air/pro is that I needed power and the ability to customize my laptop.

            "comment": "So I recently became a commuter student and I am a CS DS major. I recently purchased this [laptop](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-envy-2-in-1-15-6-touch-screen-laptop-amd-ryzen-7-8gb-memory-512gb-ssd-nightfall-black/6479178.p?skuId=6479178) since I wont be able to easily access my PC anymore. I got it on sale for $700 it was easily a steal. Powerful, compact, and good battery life.\nIf you decide to get something similar I would recommend doing the following:\n\n\nUpgrade the ram to atleast 16gb 3200mhz (I upgraded mines to 32gb bc lol why not)\n\n\n Nuke windows 11 and install windows 10\n\nDefinitely get a PC and avoid macs if able.\n\nHope this helps :)\n\n\n\nEDIT: Why to avoid macs: I work for ITS aswell and 98% of the software used throughout the school is PC only. Not to mention that PCs are easier to get assistance with from ITS should anything happen. 80% of the time someone comes in with a device and we are unable to resolve the issue it is a Mac. Just food for thought!",

            "comment": "I think it\u2019s pretty reasonable. Especially given how many people traveled for spring break, E-Days, and all the in person classes. Testing literally takes less than 5 minutes, and that\u2019s if you have to drive from a parking lot to the testing on your way home. It\u2019s an almost zero cost situation for the students and *will* prevent the mass quarantining of a lot of students who are just trying to make it through finals.",

But the insurance companies and the payment structure is entirely regulated by the current Covid relief legislation and if it costs insurance companies a little, \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f they can suck it.\n\nI think largely in the US the PPE and testing chains are about as recovered as they\u2019re going to get. I\u2019ve been getting test results from the campus company (CovidCheckColorado, who\u2019s also been doing a ton of the states vaccination logistics) in less than 24 hours.\n\nI still think biweekly testing is a perfectly reasonable and sound decision. I\u2019d bet money the schools reasoning is that it\u2019s a small change, will reduce stressful finals-season quarantining, and will allow students to continue to celebrate EDays and other in person things. Probably also helps when negotiating with the county and state to say \u201cwe\u2019re doing biweekly testing\u201d",

If people were allowed to hang out in the dorms, I'd be very surprised if that didn't significantly contribute to the spread.\n\n&gt; Rule: a mandatory 1 week quarantine after spring break\n\nIt can take a few days after infection for the person to test positive for COVID-19.\n\nAlso, allowing spring break at all was a risky choice that many universities decided against.  It's reasonable to be extra careful to mitigate possible spread.\n\n(Are they actually making you all do remote classes for a week?  Everyone else is sticking with their normal class schedule, but no in-person stuff outside of class.)\n\n&gt; There is no definitive plan for returning to normalcy\n\nThey've stated that they're planning on going full in-person in the fall, case rates and vaccination rates permitting.\n\n&gt; Complete incongruence in policy between returning from winter break and returning from spring break.\n\nI don't know what the difference you're referring to is.\n\n&gt; Having three vaccinated individuals who all tested negative in a dorm room together is not allowed.\n\nThis is a fair point.  CDC guidelines are that social distancing restrictions can be dropped for small gatherings among fully-vaccinated people.\n\nI would assume that, since students mostly became eligible less than a week ago, there hasn't been time or need to update their policy.  Especially for the students who live in the dorms (and thus mostly don't have cars for more distant vaccination locations), I'd be surprised if a large enough share are vaccinated by May for it to matter much.\n\nThere's also the concern of unvaccinated people seeing how vaccinated people (reasonably) loosen up their own restrictions and follow suit.  It's dumb, but it definitely happens--not to mention that it can't help with COVID fatigue to see a quarter of your floor (or whatever) going back to a semblance of normalcy while you're still stuck.\n\n&gt; Edit: forgot about this one, halving the amount of freshmen on campus after thanksgiving break and before Christmas\n\nDid they actually kick people out?  My understanding was that they just advised (not required) people not to return if they went home for Thanksgiving, since classes were going online anyway.\n\n&gt; I know this is beyond the school, but covid-19 is being treated like the Black Death.\n\nIs it?  There's been maybe a month or two this whole academic year where you couldn't go to a restaurant (indoors) in Jefferson County.  Restrictions in Colorado have mostly been capacity and distancing, not actually lockdowns except during major surges.  That seems like a reasonable response to something like COVID.",

When CU Boulder in the fall wasn't even bothering with widespread real testing, I could see that discouraging the students from taking it seriously.\n\nIf they might have been a little overzealous on some points (I don't think they were, but if), that's a small price to pay for having hybrid and in-person classes available, especially when one's social circles are so important for stress management here.",

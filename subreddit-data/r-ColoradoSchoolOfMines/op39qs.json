    "postText": "Hello all! So I was looking at the course catalog for electrical engineering and saw that for one of my distributed science electives I have the option of CHGN 122 (chem 2) or CHGN 125(molecular engineering &amp; materials chemistry). I was hoping I could get some insight into the differences between the two. Thanks!! :)",

            "comment": "CHGN 125 is the MME version of Chem 2. It's a very materials oriented course, with emphasis on you learning rather than being able to regurgitate facts. The tests were online open book/note but that may change if Professor Selinger retires.\n\nCHGN122 is set up really similarly to Chem 1 at mines and is a more traditional class without a focus on materials.\n\nTypically if you're MME you want to do 125 because it's directly related to your major, but a lot of people do it because it's \"easier\" as well.\n\nEdit: Eberhart, not Selinger",

I knew a lot of Mech-Es that took it as well and it was a better course that what I heard about 122 from peers.\n\nIf you arent a chemistry major, I would highly, highly recommend the course especially in the fall semester, the class is somewhat small and it's easy to get help cause it was only 35ish students in the entire course when I took it, if it is Eberhart, the class is a blast and it's been one of my favorite classes at the school so far.\n\nEdit: just saw you're looking at EE! Would highly recommend, you talk a lot about semiconductors in the end of the course which is highly applicable to EE and doesn't get talked about as much in depth in any other course besides the special Semiconductor Processing graduate course.",

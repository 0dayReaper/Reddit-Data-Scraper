Also, should I wait until class starts to order them (to ensure I\u2019ll actually need them) or make sure I have everything before? Thanks for any advice!",

The library has textbooks for every class I took so if you only need them a couple of times it might be better to just take pictures of the sections you need. libgen.li also has tons of textbook pdfs online for free. In terms of where to buy textbooks just look wherever is cheapest. It doesn't really matter what store you buy them from.",

            "comment": "Wait till classes start unless it's obvious you'll need the book. Regardless, try to search for it online using the ISBN. If possible, purchase the international English edition with the same ISBN as it will be sometimes 75-90% cheaper than the European/NA version.\n\nI did this all my years and the only issue I ever came across was that the book problems might be ordered differently or ONLY in SI. Just go to the library and make a quick couple of copies of the book problems for that week if that's the case.\n\nNo sense paying $300 for the US version when you can get the same info for $50 and whatever you spend making a few copies at the library.\n\nGood sites to use:\n\nhttps://isbnsearch.org/\n\nhttps://www.alibris.com/\n\nhttps://www.abebooks.com/\n\nDon't forget to look for coupon codes and deals. You can normally knock off the shipping that way.",

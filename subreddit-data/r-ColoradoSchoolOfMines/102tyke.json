    "postText": "Hello! I am a prospective student for the fall of 2023 and I was wondering if anyone could tell me a little bit about Mines\u2019 marching band. More specifically, how would I go about getting involved? And, would it be a big issue if I don\u2019t have previous marching experience? (For context, I am a band student but my highschool does not have a marching band).",

It gives you a little bit of GPA padding (you'll appreciate it when junior year classes hit you like a fully loaded truck) and helps the music department get funding.\n\nMines band is very chill: they recognize that nobody is here explicitly *for* music, but they also recognize that there's a ton of talent in musician-engineers so they *will* push you to do your best. Marching band is pretty low key, in my time out was mostly \"Park and bark\" shows where you just walk out in one formation and hold it for the show. Only exception being homecoming, where we'd \"split the atom\", but even that was pretty simple choreo.\n\nThere's also orchestra, which often does a piece or two with strings + winds, of that interests you. Jazz band if you're interested (my first semester I played tenor saxophone in jazz band...but I'm actually a bassist. So no worries about being out of your element if you're at least somewhat competent). And a minor in music technology that I'd recommend. It's only a few more classes than you're already required to take for your humanities and social science credits, and Bob/John are good profs. I actually had them as my references when applying for jobs my senior year, rather than any of my Physics profs.",

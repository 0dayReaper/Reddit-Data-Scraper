On the academic side, every professor I have had has been genuinely interested in what they are doing, and has been effective in communicating that passion to their students. I\u2019m biased since I absolutely love my major (MME, best major only major) but I learn fascinating things every day from industry experts who\u2019s eyes light up just like mine when talking about their subject. Mines is THE place to be an \u00fcber dork, and I wouldn\u2019t trade that for anything.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m no longer a student (graduated last may). The absolute best thing about Mines in my opinion is how much it sets you up for success in the workforce. I landed a pretty prestigious position at a fortune 100 aerospace company and had competing offers all while graduating during Covid. The workforce, especially in Colorado, knows about Mines and respects it. It has only helped me move forward in my career. The only drawback that I think everyone should be aware of is MAKE SURE you want to be an engineer. Mines is amazing and perfect for learning to be an engineer, but not for much else. If you\u2019re dedicated and willing to put in the time it is one of the best personal investments you can make.",

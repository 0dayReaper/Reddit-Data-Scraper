            "comment": "I graduated in May 2021 so it\u2019s possible some of the courses have changed. \n\nDatabase Management: You can sleep through it \n\nLinux OS: I guess it depends on your familiarity a little but should probably be sleeping through this one too. \n\nComp Org: kinda sucks but workload shouldn\u2019t be too bad. The programming hw is in assembly so it\u2019s nothing too complicated and once you get the hang of it it goes quicker. I skipped ~month of class near the end due to some reasons and had a mild panic when I can back for the last two weeks and had no idea what was happening but I still ended up doing fine. \n\nAlgorithms: 80% of the semester you can cruise through 20% you\u2019ll be panicking. Most of it is easy but some of the projects I would recommend not putting off. I did not get to choose my algo bowl group and with a less cooperative group on top of procrastinating gave me a rough 3 days getting that one in. But that\u2019s pretty much worse case. \n\nThe rest of these I didn\u2019t take myself, but data science should be easy, the math class will likely be like every other one at mines, and machine learning is probably similar to algorithms, maybe a bit harder. Just guessing on those though. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine with a handful of painful weeks thrown in there.",

            "comment": "Database and Intro to Linux are historically both pretty easy. CPW doesn't teach Database so no guarantees, but SQL is pretty easy.\n\nCompOrg and Algorithms are both middle difficulty. If you pay attention to the lectures you should be fine, if not you're kinda toast. And the tests for both are brutal. Like, \"class average in the mid 60s\" brutal. Oh, and if you get Qi Han, *do not do anything to upset her, ever.* She seems super nice at first, but the second she's upset with you or your class she gets real nasty real quick. But if you avoid that you should be fine. \n\nCan't speak to applied stats.\n\nMachine Learning and database aren't too hard. Term projects aside you can get most of the work done in class IIRC. That said, don't leave the projects to the last minute. Hopefully since I took it they made Hua fix the homeworks for ML, at the time the code they give you was broken and the TAs had to tell us how to fix it so we could even start it (and it had been that for at least 3 semesters). Which was a pain.",

            "comment": "From my experience with the course materials as a recent grad. In order of difficulty:\n\nI dont remember 403 if that speaks to the difficulty if it is a required class. If it isnt required I likely didnt take it though.\n\nDatabase Management was straightforward and all material was easy. The projects werent too bad and I didnt spend much time per week on the class.\n\nData Science and ML have very much so overlapping material and a lot of the stuff covered will be in both. That being said the combo shouldnt be too bad. Just focus on learning scikitlearn for these classes and you will be good!\n\nApplied stats was a pretty standard math class at mines. The coding isnt too bad in it and the class now really focuses on that so as a comp sci you should be good. (Assuming cs from all the classes)\n\nComp Org may be harder but its all doable. The projects need a bit of work but I dont know how they have changed post mips. And you can use notecards on the exams (at least when I took it)\n\nAlgs is the hardest but very doable if you spend the time focusing on the projects. They are the majority of the grade so I lived in algs office hours.",

            "comment": "I took data science last fall. Tbh it was a waste of time. If you are doing data science track I guess you have to take it, but for me it just counted as a general elective not a cs elective (which I didn't know at the time). The class is very easy. I went to lecture maybe half a dozen times and every time it was useless. The class has a final project very similar to database's final project, if you can find someone who is also taking both and get in a group with them for both classes you can probably reuse a ton of stuff between the classes. I haven't taken database yet, but I was in a group with 2 guys who already took it and they just reused their database project so I hardly had to do anything. Free A\n\nTook Linux last fall as well. It's a free A. You need to study a bit (mostly memorization) for the exams but there's basically nothing else you need to do.\n\nTook comp org last fall as well. It was tough, other people already said more about it.\n\nAnd I'll be in algos with you next semester.\n\nI'm taking 18 next semester. Probably easier classes though: Algos, CS Field Session, Intro to Real Analysis, Intro to Math Modeling, Abstract Algebra, Programming Challenges 2, and a half credit PA. I am most worried about real analysis.",

However, they will stack: DS, ML, and DB all have big final projects at the end so the last few weeks you might regret your schedule a lot.)",

    "postText": "I got off the waitlist at Mines a few days ago and I have to decide whether to go by Sunday. It\u2019s $10k more than my 2nd choice, Oregon state honors college. But it shouldn\u2019t be a problem as long as I don\u2019t take 5 years. I\u2019m very happy and honored I got off the waitlist, but I\u2019m worried Mines is going to be too much for me. I\u2019m an above average student but I\u2019ve barely touched coding (CS major) and I don\u2019t think I want me college experience to be 90% coding. How\u2019s student life at Mines? And do you think an average guy can maintain a good GPA and graduate in 4 years here?\n\nP.S. I know this applies to very few people but if you have any advice that\u2019d be great. I\u2019m also an Australian Dual Citizen and have been looking at Melbourne University which I think would be a good experience and way cheaper. If I get went there would I struggle getting a US job with a foreign degree? Or would the 3-4 compared to 4-6 degree length give me an advantage in the workplace?\n\nAlso my Girlfriend is likely going to University of Denver so that\u2019s be a major plus.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1304yy6)",

Junior year and beyond it when the coding really starts actually ramping up. \nStudent life isn\u2019t phenomenal, it\u2019s not a \u201cfun\u201d school. The workload is tough and the gender ratio is brutal. But you can thrive if you make the right friends and groups and work/study with them. I think 4 years is very feasible, but it\u2019ll take hard work and knowing the right people.\nHonestly, I\u2019d just go for what\u2019s cheapest. Mines has a great reputation locally, but out of state tuition is brutal",

I think it\u2019s like that at most US colleges lol, though I will be coming in with like 3-6 AP credits (idk what mines takes) But yeah one of the parts I\u2019m most worried about is just how brutal the degree is. Also Melbourne would be 5k tuition if we\u2019re going by cost!",

I'm cureently a junior in comp sci, and while the topics can be rough sometimes, there is also a ton of support and they're constantly trying to improve it.",

Also if you want your college experience to be more than just coding, that is totally manageable. Most of our CS majors choose to play league whenever they have free time, but that choice is up to you.",

I came in as a Mechanical and switched to CS after my first semester, and I\u2019m slated to graduate in three years with no major hiccups. Admittedly, I did have to grind a lot (mainly this semester), but if I can do it you can do it (I would also typecast myself as the average guy). I would say go for it, and it sounds like you have other good options if things don\u2019t work out.",

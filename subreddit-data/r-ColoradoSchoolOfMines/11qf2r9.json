I\u2019ve heard a lot about the \u201cPathway to Mines\u201d program but don\u2019t know a whole lot about it. If I were to be rejected what would be the most efficient way to get accepted? (Preferably for 2024 Fall enrollment)\n\nI\u2019m out of state by the way, if that makes any difference.",

Idk how it works if you\u2019re rejected. It is a lot easier to transfer in then to apply right out of high school though and you save money going to community college.",

I'd guess that there are better options, but if it's what you really want, go ahead.",

What major did you apply for?",

            "comment": "Parent here of a prospective student who also got the \u201cPathway to Mines\u201d offer. Like most of you, getting to the ground truth of what that means has been difficult and Mines admissions has been unresponsive. So, after lots of calls, emails, finally driving to up to speak with one of the coordinators, I believe I have the answer.\n\nWhat Pathway to Mines is: An agreement between Mines and the Colorado Community College System (CCCS) to guarantee the transfer of credits for students that meet all the conditions for acceptance. Those conditions include, earn an AES degree from ANY of the CCCS schools, get As &amp; Bs in math/science classes, graduate with a 3.25 cumulative GPA.\n\nWhat it is NOT: There is no guarantee enrollment or admission. The agreement between Mines and CCCS is the guarantee to transfer credits IF your transfer is accepted. No small task and they will hold you to every criterion; for example, we were told if you graduate with a 3.25 GPA or higher, but say you got a C in calculus\u2026 you will be rejected.\n\nGoing to Red Rocks CC does not guarantee you admission or a \u201cspot\u201d at Mines. What RRCC offers is a program called Mines Academy which you apply for after you enroll at RRCC. Basically, it does two things: 1) gets you extra counseling support (to keep you on track to meet all those conditions) and 2) connectivity to the Mines community through visits, tours, even a class on campus so, should your transfer request be accepted, you\u2019re familiarity puts you in a great position to be successful there. Mines Academy does not guarantee you enrollment at Mines nor does RRCC give you any special advantage over any of the other CCCS schools like Pikes Peak State College (note: this revelation came directly from the Mines Academy director at RRCC). RRCC does a great job to put you in an excellent position to transfer, but at the end of the day, Mines won\u2019t care which of the CCCS schools you attended.\n\nAll that said, if you meet every condition to the letter, the chances are pretty good your transfer to Mines will be accepted\u2026 but no guarantee (even if you meet all the criteria). Hope this helps!",

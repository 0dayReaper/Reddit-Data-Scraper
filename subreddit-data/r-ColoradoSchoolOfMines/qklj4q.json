    "postText": "Hey Everyone,\n\nLoss can come in a vast variety of ways. Losing a loved one/friend, having a break-up, failing a test or class, it comes in a lot of shapes and sizes.\n\nThe easiest thing to do when loss happens is to give up, isolate yourself, and lose yourself in your suffering. Mourning is a necessary part of grieving, but letting it take over your life can be crippling to your mental state. For anyone suffering right now, try to do positive activities that you enjoy, or start new activities, in order to force yourself to move forward. \"Fake it til' you make it\" is a very true sentiment, as the more surrounded you are by friends, family, and activities, the more you can start to heal. There isn't any cure-all for recovering from loss. It is a slow, painful process that can take over your life, even when you are making a conscious effort to move on. But keep at it. Even at the lowest point in your life, there is hope.\n\nI've been there, and I'm sure a vast majority of students have also been there. Move forward and take control of your life. We are all here for you.",

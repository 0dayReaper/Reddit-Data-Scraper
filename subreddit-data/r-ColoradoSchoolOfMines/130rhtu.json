    "postText": "Mom of a Mines sophomore here. Just want to know if it\u2019s fairly common to dislike Mines (workload, some BS busy classes, sparse social life) while at same time not wanting to transfer at all. I think child is really invested in that silver diploma and also just \u201cdoin\u2019 what you gotta do\u201d to get thru it. I look back on my college years at a Seven Sisters college as some of the best of my life, even though it was also intellectually challenging. Are things really, really different there?",

            "comment": "I just looked up Seven Sisters and it says it's a liberal arts college. I dont think you can really compare that to going to an engineering school. Being someone who has both a liberal arts (Sociology from TexasA&amp;M) degree and an engineering degree (ME from Mines), the workload and expectations are just different. \n\nI'd argue classes get better after sophomore year, and even then \"busy\" classes are required for accreditation. Mines is what you make of it. I'm sorry it sounds like you don't like it, but if your son does, it's a great investment. \n\nGood luck.",

Did my undergrad at a different engineering school before coming to Mines, and if anything Mines \u201cculture\u201d is more unique and enjoyable IMO.\n\nBut any statement attempting to summarize the average experience at a school is misleading. Majority of the time, it is what you make of it. If you feel your social life is lacking, there are so many clubs to choose from and get involved in.\n\nI will also say that I think there has been a culture shift in the country at large, however - particularly for younger people since covid. The online-only courseload during lockdown and the proliferation of online interaction (social media etc.) has prevented many from developing normal IRL friend groups in the past few years. To be honest I think we\u2019re all still recovering in one way or another.",

There's no way to cover that thoroughly and have it not suck a bit.\n\n(Edit: that's not to say that engineering programs can't be/aren't enjoyable and interesting. I loved my undergrad at Mines.

Many of the people I was in classes with thought of the ethics, language arts, writing, and econ classes all as fillers that were a waste of time and a money grab to make us have more credits. \n\nEvery job I've had since I graduated I have needed to be able to communicate results, findings, documentation in general and the project I deliver to the client is in a report. The writing classes in college would not have been enough if I really believed that \"engineers don't write good\" and that that is okay because we are good with STEM and don't need liberal arts. Being well rounded is supremely important, mentoring engineers right out of college reminds me of that regularly.",

My mom was worried about this exact thing back when I went to Mines.\n\nI graduated in 2014, and work/life balance got considerably easier after graduating, which I\u2019m sure a lot of alumni would agree. The idea is you suffer for 4 years to give yourself a higher chance of getting a job that pays well and let\u2019s you do the things you actually want to do (travel, hobbies, etc). I wouldn\u2019t change it, even remembering how hard it was balancing the schoolwork/sports/social life/sleep.",

    "postText": "My son took several AP/DE classes during high school, now his freshman schedule looks like this: Thermodynamics 1, Physics 2, Statics, Differential Equations, IDEAS (he is a Thorson scholar). A total of 17.5 credits (considering freshman orientation class). Is it too much? I am asking him to consider to drop out a class. Which one is the hardest? CASA advisor tell him just to try for the following weeks then decide, but I still not sure if this schedule is doable for a freshman. (He also has to have a GPA of 3 to keep a scholarship )",

            "comment": "Wow. Smart kid! That\u2019s going to be brutal though, I\u2019d suggest dropping physics 2, in my opinion it\u2019s the hardest class in his sequence. He could take it next semester and then do feedback control systems and scientific computing 1st semester sophomore year. I\u2019d suggest looking at his flowchart and seeing if there are any potential blockages later on his course load if he doesnt knock out any of them now. Thermo dynamics is another decent idea to drop since it only flows into heat transfer which is a course most students dont take until senior year (after taking fluids and scientific computing).",

            "comment": "I was placed in 17.5 credit hours my first semester, and took AP classes in HS. They also placed me in mostly classes with additional lab hours and it was pretty rigorous but it was doable. Honestly if he can use those extra hours this semester to get a semester or year ahead in his degree with that and his ap credit, all the best to him, that's what I'm doing, I have gotten a full year ahead on my track to graduate and maintained a gpa above 3.0\n\nIf it is too much, it's not that bad to drop before the cutoff day. Just have a class in mind to drop so that can get put on low priority if it does become too much work.\n\nEdit:\nI took Chem 125, Phys 2, Design 1, Honors Calc 3 as well as the freshman success seminar that first semester\n\nEdit 2: and Calc 2 short form the first month",

            "comment": "Personally having taken all of those classes except IDEAS, I would switch out Thermodynamics for something else. It\u2019s a pretty difficult course, and it is designed to be taken by students that have several semesters of college under their belt already. Combined with physics 2, it would be absolutely brutal. 17.5 isn\u2019t a horrible number of hours, but try and find some a class geared more towards freshman. Maybe Nature and Human Values, or design 1? Just to help him adjust to college classes first",

I personally take 18 a semester and know people who take up to 21, but if your son is worried there is no shame in taking an easier first semester to get settled.  Dorm life can be tough to adjust to, particularly due to COVID, and I saw plenty of people sink and plenty of people swim, regardless of credit count.\n\nEither way as your son has so many credits coming in, he could very easily take an easier first semester while still graduating early.",

Sure, if you already have healthy habits and a determined mindset its possible. I'd rather take the first semester a bit more easily and then increase the rigor after you know more about your limits. It's easier to pass a smaller workload than to fail a class because you were doing too much.",

It's not hard content-wise, it just has so much work associated with it. It has 4 homework assignments a week and you spend a lot of time in that class learning engineering formatting.\n\nKeep in mind that your kid doesn't have to drop classes for a couple weeks. Maybe he can check things out and see what he thinks.",

My only saving grace was I was well versed in writing lab reports and I picked up good study skills my previous semesters. \n\nI think his schedule is doable since it\u2019s not inundated with labs. But the most important thing is that he gets a break. So many people push themselves to their limits here and that\u2019s why you see a lot of mental health issues around this school. Given he also has a required GPA to keep, that also adds to the stress.\n\nIf he wants to do that, that\u2019s fine. But remind him that he needs to be able to escape mentally from school throughout the week and to never think less of himself for needing to drop a course.\n\nEdit: I would honestly say he should drop a class and if he wants do a loaded schedule like that next semester. I think it\u2019s good to get your feet wet first at this school. Because they really do expect a lot from you and it can be overwhelming.",

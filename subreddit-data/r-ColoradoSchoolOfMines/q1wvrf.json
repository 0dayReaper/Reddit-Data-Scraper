    "postText": "I have two leads for job opportunities for the following majors - seeking graduates in Civil / Process / Mechanical / Electrical in Minneapolis OR Software / Computer Science in New York! \n\nOne is a consulting firm in agricultural and industrial engineering in Minneapolis who is currently hiring. Great wages, amazing opportunities for growth, and good benefits is currently looking to hire entry level engineers and consider mid level engineers willing to relocate! \n\nMy best friend's company is hiring software engineers in Rochester, NY. Looking for talented individuals with C+ knowledge or willing to learn. I believe they are department of defense contractors working on communications equipment so you will need to pass a background check!\n\nIf you are currently interested in relocating feel free to reach out and I'm happy to get you in contact!",

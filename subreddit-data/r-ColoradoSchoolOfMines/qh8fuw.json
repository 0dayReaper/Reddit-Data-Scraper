Mines' policies have to take into account 10% or so of students who aren't vaccinated and against whom they can't really enforce specific policies (because faculty aren't allowed to ask about vaccination status).",

            "comment": "If the situation is soooo dangerous that people still have  \nto wear masks REGARDLESS of injection status then Mines should not be having in-person  \nclasses at all. Period. At the very least, they should be continuing to offer  \nthe option to take classes remotely if students so choose. The infrastructure  \nand networking is already all in place and instructors have been teaching almost  \nall classes remotely for over a year. Instead, the Mines administration has  \noutright FORBIDDEN instructors from making any part of their classes available  \nremotely if their class is listed as \u201cin-person\u201d, even if they have the  \nmaterials to do so and have done so previously. The cognitive dissonance that  \nthe administration must have in order to make decisions like this is absolutely  \nastounding. One of my instructors informed me that Mines was losing \\~ $40M per  \nsemester when everything was remote. Once again, the administration\u2019s actions  \nreinforce the truth that the only thing they really care about is money. I can\u2019t  \nWAIT to be done with this institution.",

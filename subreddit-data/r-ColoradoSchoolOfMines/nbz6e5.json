    "postText": "Getting this error anytime I try to modify my schedule in any way. If I type in a CRN and click register or click drop on the web, nothing happens and this annoying message pops up.\n\nI\u2019ve already had a zoom meeting with someone from the registrars office, I shared my screen and showed them the exact issue and they said I was still on the waitlist, but I don\u2019t believe it because the class shows the same number of spots full/empty on the waitlist and my schedule has not changed or updated. And given how unreliable the admin are at this school, I\u2019m skeptical to trust someone who just says take my word for it without giving any confirmation.\n\nI\u2019m trying to get into a summer class with a small waitlist that\u2019s filling up quickly. Already emailed the prof and he usually admits the waitlist, but I cannot register, waitlist, or drop classes because of this error.\n\nAnybody else run into this issue or know a solution? It\u2019s really stressing me out.",

            "comment": "Kind of a hacky way but could you add another class that\u2019s at a different time, then drop the previous class, and then add the new class you want, then drop the temporary one? If you\u2019re having issues with a time conflict I think this would work. You can\u2019t drop a class and then add a new one if you\u2019re only signed up for one (even if it\u2019s doing both actions at once. Ugh trailhead)\n\nIf it\u2019s not a time conflict between the original class and the class you want, register for the new class first and after that drop the old class, that way you\u2019re never \u201cdropping\u201d your last class",

Click on the button that says \"Student Registration\" and then \"Register for Classes.\" There should be an option there to drop classes, which worked for me.",

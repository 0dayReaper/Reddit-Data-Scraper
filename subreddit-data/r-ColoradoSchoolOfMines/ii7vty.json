People\u2019s behavior towards RL staff can be rude at best, dehumanizing at worst. \nThis is destroying us. Trying to build community while trying to understand and enforce new policies is miserable. People have come to me crying almost every day about their worries for residents, themselves, and each other. Some people are even scared to leave their rooms because of the constant fear of residents berating and harassing them. \nSo please: be kind and wear a damn mask.",

If somebody walks the wrong direction or sits at the wrong table or something Mines staff really need to start trying to figure out how to tell us what we should be doing instead of flipping out on us for doing it wrong",

There was no signage at that point indicating to use another entrance.\n\nSome of the food service people are great, but an equal number always seem like they don\u2019t want to be here and are rude.

Believe it or not, the RA's have to follow the same rules that every other student on campus does. The rules can suck ass but honestly it's not asking much to wear your mask and keep a safe distance from people. I agree, I wish that we wouldn't have to treat people \"like criminals\" and write people up and stuff, it sucks and I hate having to do it. I wish that people would wear their masks and follow guidelines not because there's a big mean scary person in a blue polo out to get them, but because they want to keep our campus community safe and on campus. Unfortunately though, a large minority of people just aren't taking this situation seriously, and it seems that you are in that camp. The risk people run of sending us all home by not wearing a mask, not obeying occupancy limits, and not using hand sanitizer frequently is a lot higher than many people realize.

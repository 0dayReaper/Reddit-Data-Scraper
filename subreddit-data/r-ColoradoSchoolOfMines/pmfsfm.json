I thought my health insurance waiver lasted for one year, and since I submitted in January, that it would cover me for the fall. I was just informed that this is not the case. Online, it says that they accept late waivers for a $125 fee, which I'll happily accept over the cost of health insurance that I don't need, but there is nowhere to submit the late waivers (the portal is closed). Does anyone know how the late waiver submission works? Again I realize I'm an idiot but that is a lot of money and I'm pretty desperate not to pay the full fee.",

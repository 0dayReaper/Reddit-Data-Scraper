South Dakota she would graduate with no debt. Plus she could run cross country and track there whereas at Colorado she likely would get cut. She will likely be a CS major.",

I'd look at the decision through the lens of money and college experience. If South Dakota will be fun with XC, the campus/area isn't bad and has things to do, and theres no debt....go SD. The strength of the CS program won't matter unless shes planning to be an algorithms researcher, most of us do the exact same work and the 'theoretical' strength of the degree could not matter less. I minored in CS at CSM (major ChemE) and jumped right into a software job and didn't look back.",

Iowa State also has a good CS program if you are coming from that part of the country.",

Many studies have shown that the name recognition of your alma mater matters very little, and the quality of education from SDSM is gonna be of a very similar caliber to CSM.\n\nHave you and your daughter talked about what the debt repayment would *actually* look like? How much would she be paying per month/year, and for how long? Subtract that from your \"expected starting salary\" the career center parades in from of visiting students and ask whether the debt is really worth it.\n\nI wasn't an athlete but I am a musician and the fact that I could fully participate in CSM's music program rather than just the \"non-major\" ensembles at some other universities was a big plus for me. Not sure how important that is for your daughter.\n\nComputer Science isn't a specialty of CSM, but that's not to say that it has a *bad* reputation by any means. I know people that certainly *did* get a great CS education here, but the ones doing the best were very self-driven to explore new technologies in addition to their coursework. Their success is more attributable to their personal GitHub than any prestige from the CSM name.",

If one of the big drivers of the decision is cost I would recommend keeping her options open and trying for as many scholarships as possible and making a decision after she knows what her financial situation actually looks like.\n\nActually touring both schools is also obviously an important consideration. She should make sure that she will be happy at the school she ends up at. Engineering degrees are hard and you\u2019ll only make it through if you enjoy your life outside of school/are happy in your college environment. One of the big things I chose CSM is because I love the campus and the SDSMT campus wasn\u2019t really my vibe.",

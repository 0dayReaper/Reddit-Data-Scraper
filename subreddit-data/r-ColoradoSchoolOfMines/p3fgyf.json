I don't remember what I wrote for mine but I do know it wasn't that great. If you get the Golden application, Mines already had you essentially on priority. If your gpa and test scores are decently good and you show you want to do engineering, it's pretty likely for you to get in.\n\nThat being said, I think that a good thing to say would be something along the lines of: your personal experiences give you a unique perspective and a unique way of approaching problems",

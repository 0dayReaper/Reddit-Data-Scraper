But the symbol itself was used and continues to be used for unrelated purposes.  There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with a swastica unless the intention behind the symbol is to evoke the same symbolism that was intended by the Nazi\u2019s.   \n\nPeople seem to look for negativity and purposefully try to be offended these days.",

It\u2019s immature and gets rather old when people find these accidental swastica and attempt to place some negative meanings on them.  \n\nA symbol only bears what meaning you give to it.  That desk bears no meaning.",

The way I saw it, the point the post is making is that it\u2019s funny nobody responsible for putting that desk there caught that the top of the desk looks exactly like a swastika, a design people generally try to avoid using because it causes visceral reactions and pointless debates.\n\nThe desk itself clearly means nothing. The fact that it   looks like a swastika from the top and wasn\u2019t removed or changed to keep people from getting offended about it is amusing, not because it\u2019s offensive, but because running the risk of somebody flipping out about a swastika desk is almost always more trouble than it\u2019s worth, and the person responsible is running that risk.",

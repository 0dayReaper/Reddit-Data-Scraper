    "postText": "Hey guys,\nI\u2019m thinking about applying to the MS CS Bridge program here, and I have a few questions about it:\n\n1. I was wondering how hard it is to get into? I\u2019m a pre med major with little CS experience, and my gpa is around 3.3? Also is GRE required?\n\n2. Is there value in getting a MS CS here? Do y\u2019all have a hard time finding jobs?\n\nThanks!",

That's not to say that you won't get in, but try to spice up your application with other accomplishments.  The CS department is excellent at mines; I took a lot of the undergrad classes and a few graduate classes and they were all great. I had many friends in the CS undergrad program that are all doing well in lucrative jobs. The CS program and Mines in general put an emphasis on practical skills and job placement. If you choose this program, I would be surprised to learn you had trouble getting placed afterwards. I didn't have to take the GRE but only because I was at mines for undergrad iirc. I'd encourage you to reach out to the department directly to ask about admission requirements. I'd also suggest looking into their masters in data science program; with your background in pre med this would give you a good stepping stone into the bioinformatics world. Good luck with the school hunt!",

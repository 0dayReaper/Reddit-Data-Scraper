I have it with me in my dorm and is wiped clean to factory standard so none of my stuff is on it anymore.\n\nSpecs:\n\n\\- i7 10750h CPU\n\n\\-Nvidia 2060 mobile GPU\n\n\\- 1TB m.2 SSD\n\n\\- 15.6\" 1080p resolution screen\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't had it for too long, a year and a half tops. Looking to sell it as I recently built a desktop. It'll run SolidWorks or anything you need (games too). \n\n$800 for sale, and you can come on up to the dorm to check it out.",

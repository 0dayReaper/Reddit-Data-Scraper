    "postText": "Does anyone have experience renting a house with different people? The house is \\~$3000, and I have two other people who I plan on living with. I will be paying about $1000 per month.  How does the lease work in this situation in most cases? do we all sign a separate lease? or do we combine the money and pay each month as one check?  Also, how trustable are facebook market ads?",

Usually it depends on the lease and property owner want but we all signed the same lease in addition to any co-signers necessary. At the apartment I rented and house I\u2019m renting currently we were each able to pay separately either by an online portal or by check/Venmo/PayPal, however have heard folks who had to collect and pay as one entity but that\u2019s rare. Would highly recommend taking a tour of the place prior to signing any lease or agreement as a unless there is a time stamp those photos could\u2019ve been taken at any time and I have seen instances of houses or apartments in renovation being posted online showing other units or pre renovation photos. Otherwise I\u2019d say the ad is fairly trustworthy.",

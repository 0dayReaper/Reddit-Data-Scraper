You must provide alternative day to be called within the next 6 months. You only get one postponement.  \n\nThis all should have been included with the jury summons paperwork mailed, as well.\n\nThe FAQ for the state for: What if I am a student?\n\n   Jurors who are temporarily out of the county or state:  If the juror will be out of the county on their appearance date but lives in the county more than 50% of the time and will be returning within the next 6 months, they should be postponed to a time when they are back in the county.",

I didn\u2019t end up getting selected thankfully but the profs seemed fine with giving me some flexibility for HW quizzes. \n\nWould be interesting if there is an exemption though, had not heard of it before.",

Fortunately, jury duty is a valid excusable absence so I went to the courthouse for my duty....then got sent home because they already got all the members they needed. I actually ended up still making it to class that day, which was pretty cool.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn summary, you might have to appear, but you'll probably get sent home",

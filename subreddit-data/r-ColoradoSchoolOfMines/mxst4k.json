    "postText": "Took the second dose of Moderna yesterday and have been completely knocked out for about 15 hours now.\n\nI have a high temperature, body-aches and dizziness. I feel tired but I cannot sleep as I have a headache as well as because of the fever\n\nPart of me is happy that my body seems to be responding well to the vaccine and that I have proof that it works. But this is unlike any illness I've ever had and it's messing up my schedule for doing assignments over the weekend:(",

I didn't get hit as hard, but I was still too tired to do any meaningful work for about three days after the J&amp;J and spent a week digging myself out.\n\nIt is supposed to be safe to take over-the-counter anti-inflammatories after the shot (just not before).  That definitely helped me; got rid of the headache.",

These include, but are not limited to:\n\n\u2022 \u2060Rudeness towards other Redditors, \u2022 \u2060Spreading incorrect information, \u2022 \u2060Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.\n\nAm I banned from the Reddit?\n\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.\n\nI don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?\n\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n\nHow can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nAccept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",

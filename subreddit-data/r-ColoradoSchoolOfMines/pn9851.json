I've mostly seen emails about getting a resume ready (which I can somewhat do myself) but what do I actually do to prepare other than that?",

Go through the career fair book tonight and look at all of the companies in your field listed as offering undergrad internships this summer in your field. Pick your favorites and spend a few minutes looking into the company and the position. Apply, if it's open, on diggernet. Go by the booth and say hello and drop off a resume. Ask about their experience at the company. Ask for details about the internship that aren't covered in the listing. Does the company have a training and development program? Does it have a hands-on component? What software will you be using? If you can note that person's name and email and that evening write them a note on linked in or email thanking them.  If the company has an info session go to that and leave a resume with them again. With that, you've made 4 points of contact on your preferred internship positions.",

Do some research on the companies you\u2019re interested in (this part is really important, you want to ask them questions and be interested in the work they\u2019re doing. That\u2019s what will lead to talking about you and what you\u2019re interested in). The most important part though is just talk to as many companies you can. The more connections you can get and experience talking in a professional setting the better. And as hard as it can be, make some damn good eye contact with the interviewer you\u2019re talking to",

A $30 suit from ross that's super baggy and weird will give the impression that you aren't aware of social norms. People often hire based on appearance (partially, at least) which sucks but it's the truth. (also a suit is not required at all, just nice pants and a button down, shave, etc.)\n\n1-page resume is important. If your GPA is below 3.0, don't put it on the resume. Just don't put the number on the page, often people don't even care, as long as you have some relevant skills.\n\nIntroduce yourself to people, talk to the reps. Don't just drop resumes, actually meet people. Often those reps will be setting up interviews on the spot, so you can actually ask for an interview, don't wait to be offered. \"So, how long are you here for? Having interviews later today or tomorrow? I'm interested in working for you this summer.\"",

    "postText": "I am hoping to take a class over the summer to make my next semester a little lighter/not pay as much for some credits. I'll be working over the summer so I'm looking for a decently easy class that I can get a passing grade in and then move on with my life. Does anyone have any experience or thoughts on taking calc 3 or a global studies equivalent at red rocks? \n\nThanks!",

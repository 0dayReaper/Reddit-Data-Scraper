    "postText": "So I was a fairly lackluster high school student, I had always thought of coming to mines but knew I would get rejected out of high school.\n\nI\u2019m now in my 4th semester of college at Texas tech university as a mechanical engineer. I have calc 1,2 and 3, chem 1, and physics 1 and 2. As well as statics, and I\u2019m currently taking differential equations and dynamics. I have a 3.28 gpa.\n\nSo I kinda have 3 questions, what are my chances of getting in as a transfer, how many credits can I expect to transfer, and what would life look like as a transfer at mines?",

They accepted me for admission and I didn't even transfer any credits.\n\nI only knew one transfer student during my time there, and it was because he went to high school with an acquaintance of mine. Nonetheless, he seemed to have a great social life at the school. I think it all depends on the transfer student.",

            "comment": "You'll get in, the minimum is a 2.7 for transfers,  However I would try and get your chem 2 in before you start at Mines.  I had around 20 credits not transfer (and I'm an instate transfer) so you might be a little frustrated there.  Student life is nice, everyone is here for engineering and everyone is pretty serious about their degree.  I like being around engies, and I'm a fan of the lack of liberal arts majors in the mix.",

I know in CO everything is pretty standard, so maybe this summer take it at a community college in Texas.  If you get a C you're G2G and won't have to do any chem here.  And once you're in getting a C over the summer won't affect anything",

            "comment": "There\u2019s a lot more flexibility for transfers regarding gpa (over HS admissions). 3.28 is great! I transferred from a community college with something similar, my high school gpa was not good. In my experience they accept credits for most courses (calc physics and Chem), but they had specific agreements with the Colorado community colleges. Overall, you lose less credits than say if you were transferring to CU Boulder, I was going through the transfer process there and it was not so good. And if something doesn\u2019t transfer, the credit hours goes toward free elective credits which is helpful. \n\nLife as a transfer is what you make it. I loved mines so much more than my previous school, most everyone takes their studies seriously and you can get involved in clubs around campus. Introduce yourself to people in your classes, you\u2019ll probably find more transfers than you think. Feel free to dm if you have any other specific transfer questions!",

You may need to fight with them over math credits, they denied my Calc credits at first but then I contacted the math department head and they worked it out with the registrar and gave me all the credit. It may be more difficult to transfer overall since you\u2019d be transferring into the most impacted major at the school. But still try!!\n\nAs for what it\u2019s like, you will likely be placed in a bunch of classes with freshmen your first year. So it may be a bit weird being the oldest of the bunch. But after you get all the mines required courses out of the way you\u2019ll be with your people. Overall, mines isn\u2019t the most social bunch of individuals, so may be some awkwardness in group work to begin, just push through!",

    "postText": "I am an incoming freshman and can technically place out of Calc 1&amp;2 with my AP score. I am concerned about jumping right into Calc 3 since it has been a year since I took calculus. I feel pretty comfortable taking Calc 1 credit, but I am not sure about the jump all the way to Calc 3. Has anyone else had experience (good or bad) with placing out? Too hard? Will I miss out on important concepts my HS may not have covered? Should I just take the credits and move on? Any advice is appreciated.",

            "comment": "I'll speak for my personal experience in Calc. I could have jumped straight to Calc 3 but I waited for the same reason you are worried about. I should have just jumped straight to Calc 3. Calc 2 is the 'weed out' math course at Mines and it feels artificially inflated in terms of difficulty. Calc 3 (which is essentially just an extension of Calc 1 as it doesn't build off of anything learned in 2) is a cakewalk in comparison. If you feel confident in Calc 1 I would say there's really no need to stay for Calc 2 unless you are a math major.",

            "comment": "If you took AP Calculus BC and got a 5 you can place out of calc 1 &amp; 2 and honestly you should.   There is, or at least used to be, a sort of Calc 2.5 class that they made all the freshman going that route take.    The class was offered at 7am or something and one was one big section, and only half the semester.   But it covered the bit of calculus that is taught in Calc 2 at Mines, but not in AP calculus BC.  Then we were all in \"honors\" calc 3 which was in effect just \"freshman calc 3\" and was a bit harder because of the way the prof taught it and did homework.     \n\n\nThis is the route you want to take.  Calc 1 and 2 are effectively weed out classes. They make them purposely hard so that anyone who cannot handle the rigor needed for later years will realize the school is too hard early on.  That is why first year retention is low relative to other schools.  The school denies that there are weed-out classes, but everyone knows this is a lie. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are no easy A's.   Even if you think, \"oh I already know calculus, I will take calc 1 and not have to study.\"   Wrong.   That class would inevitably be the biggest pain in your ass.      \nAlways take the credit when you can.   If you want to refresh your skills because it's been a while just help your friends in calc 1 on their hw and it will come back to you.  Or start watching Khan Academy right now.",

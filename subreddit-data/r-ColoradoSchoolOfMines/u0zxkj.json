    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nThis is an alt-account because I\u2019m trying to gage the atmosphere here without giving away my identity (to family/etc). Seriously, if people found out I was getting some important life advice on Reddit they might laugh at me.\n\nBut anyway, I was recently accepted to Mines on a scholarship, which I do plan on taking. I\u2019m very grateful for this opportunity, but I do have a few questions on the lifestyle and other aspects of this University\u2026\n\n1.) What is the social life like here? I understand that Mines is very school-focused, but I really want to make connections during my (theoretical) time here. Social activity is very important to me and helps with a lot of my anxieties.\n\n2.) How hard is the work? I know this school will be difficult, and I know that I will give my all to succeed, but this subreddit is really discouraging me. If it helps for reference I am planning on going into ChemE.\n\n3.) Is the male to female ratio that noticeable? I understand that it is a STEM focused school, but an estimated 75% male population sounds crazy.\n\nIn the end, I\u2019m really nervous about attending this school and college in general. I know that I can put in the work, but I also want to enjoy my time here too. I don\u2019t want my entire time in college to be work, because I know for a fact I would get severe depression or anxiety from it (I have a history of it). If I have any further questions then I\u2019ll ask them in the comments, but I\u2019m just looking for some help",

It's a lot of work. Just this week I have an exam and a project due. Then two weeks from now another exam. And in three weeks it's finals review week then finals. It's pretty hard cramming it all in, but if you put in the effort and commitment you'll get through it",

There are lots of clubs to join, and Mines has a very collaborative attitude - you can always find people to study with and help each other in classes.\n\n2.) Most of it depends on you - there\u2019s really no objective answer. The workload has never been unbearable for me, but it is busy and it\u2019s up to you to ask for help if you need it. If you have the motivation and you\u2019re willing to work hard, you can definitely do it. Keep in mind people like to complain, and dramatic stuff is always more popular. \u201cI got a B on my Calc final!\u201d isn\u2019t as likely to gain traction as something like \u201cI\u2019m failing half my classes!\u201d - what you see here is not most people. \n\n3). Again, depends on who you ask. Don\u2019t know much about this issue so I won\u2019t offer any advice on it.",

While I don't have much to compare it to, the professors for the department are genuinely really nice and want you to succeed. You are going to be overworked at times so it's important to learn what deserves your attention. Try not to obsess about grades, anything above a 3.0 will give you great opportunities at graduation. Whatever you choose, best of luck",

I never paid too much attention to it so I suppose I\u2019m not the most qualified to speak on this matter.\n\nI feel as though ChemE will be difficult and take a lot of work regardless of where you go and what admissions says.

            "comment": "1) Social life is what you want it to be, essentially. I would argue that maybe you have to work harder for it here than other places, but it really isn't difficult to find friends and make connections if you are willing to put yourself out there. Join a bunch of clubs first semester, see what you have time for and what you like, you can always leave clubs later if you don't get anything out of them lol. I am in my second semester right now and I joined 3 clubs last semester and attended campus/residence life events, which really helps a lot. \n\n2) I am a chemE (only in my second semester at mines rn), and I haven't gotten into any of the really difficult chem classes like Organic or physical chemistry yet but chem 1 and 2 weren't that bad. The work can be difficult and time consuming for most classes (especially taking more than around 16-17 credits) but that's kind of the point. There are lots of support options available from office hours to tutoring to review sessions. Time management is key in my opinion, and joining clubs/sports/etc can actually help with this. ChemE is considered by a lot to be the \"hardest\" major, but it's not like people haven't graduated with a degree in it so if others can do it so can you. \n\n3) For reference, I am a girl so my perspective might be a little different. In class, the male to female ratio isn't super noticeable unless you actually count, but in other places ex. the cafeteria and walking around, I'd say it is a lot more noticeable. This isn't really a problem for me, maybe it is for guys but that's a sacrifice they have to make I guess lol. \n\nYou can pm me or just reply if you have any more questions, need recommendations for clubs, or have any questions about specific experiences or need any other help :)",

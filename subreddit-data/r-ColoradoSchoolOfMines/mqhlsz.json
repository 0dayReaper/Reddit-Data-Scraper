Idk, worked for me. \nThere's also social media esk things that others have brought up. \n\nAlso, make sure you and your potential roommate are somewhat solid on the same things\n\nSleep schedule\nAlcohol or whatever ur gonna do in ur rooms\nNumber of people who hangout there/ atmosphere of the room\n\nI've seen a lot of people hate each other over these things. Communication is key.\n\nBest of luck! And welcome to Mines",

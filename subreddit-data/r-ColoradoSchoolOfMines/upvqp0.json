    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm a prospective student for CS@Mines Bridge program and considering enrolling this fall. I've looked for a more detailed information outside of the Bridge website but I could not find much. Has anyone been through the bridge program, and if so, could you please let me know how your experience was?  \n\nBelow are some of my questions:\n\n1. What were some positives and negatives of the program?\n2. How is the relationship between students and the instructors? Does it start out with big lecture-type classes, and then the classes become smaller as you take higher level courses? Does the instructors have industry experiences or are have a more academic background?\n3. How many students are in the program? What's the vibe of the student community? (collaborative, cut-throat, etc.) Are students mostly from in-state, or are there many from outside? Do many students work part-time while completing the program?\n4. What's the scholarship situation? Is it quite competitive?\n5. How is the professional networking/internship opportunities?\n\nThanks in advance! I'd greatly appreciate any inputs.",

            "comment": "1. No idea, I did the main CS program (which has all the bridge classes + more). Someone else will have to answer this one. \n\n2. Professors primarily an academic background, but there\u2019s quite a few with industry experience. Since the school is engineering-focused, there\u2019s definitely a central theme around application though. Class sizes are very different from a big state school \u2014 you won\u2019t have 400 people in a single lecture hall like you would at Boulder. Expect 60-80 students in a single section until you hit graduate or special topic classes. \n\n3. See (1)\n\n4. There\u2019s quite a few, and given the size of the CS program, I\u2019m always surprised at how few applicants there are. There were a couple where I was the sole applicant\u2026\n\n5. 10/10. Mines has a massive \u201ccareer day\u201d with hundreds of companies (over half of which want CS folk), and the department goes above and beyond with the \u201cc-mapp\u201d program. I had an internship every summer (including after freshman year) because of how well structured the various programs are.",

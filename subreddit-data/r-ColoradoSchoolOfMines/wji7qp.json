Rent/housing prices are crazy and the Mines parking policies are so anti-homeless and against these (camping is explicitly banned under ANY, even clean circumstances) to the point where I wonder how it can be done. where would you park and how far would it typically be?\n\nMotivation for making this post: seeing the housing shortage for first-years AND have been watching urban car/van life videos like crazy lately.",

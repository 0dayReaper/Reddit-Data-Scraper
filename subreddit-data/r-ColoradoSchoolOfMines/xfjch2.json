Golden has tons of opportunities for fun outdoor stuff, restaurants, and shopping, as well as being close to ski &amp; other mountain stuff. \n\nI\u2019m a freshman so I can\u2019t give a ton of advice but I got most of mine from searching this subreddit, reading stuff on the website, and connecting with current students. \n\nagain congrats and good luck!",

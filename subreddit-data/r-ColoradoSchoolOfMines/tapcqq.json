I've met a lot of bright engineers from larger state schools and they still have good engineering programs.  If you're getting the in-state rate it makes much more sense, but out of state is so crazy expensive that I don't believe it's worth it in most cases.  \n\nThat's not because Mines isn't a great school, it's just that it's not a 3-4x as good as an in state option (which is roughly how much more you'd be paying I'm guessing based on quick research).  You don't understand how debilitating it will be to have that much debt before you really start your adult life.  It's really not worth it",

They both will have about a \"new car loan\" amount of student debt to payoff.   \n\nAdvice another friend gave was that where you go for undergrad doesn't matter as long as you kick a** and get into a good graduate program.

It might have been because PCJ used to be the dean at the Arizona State University Engineering School and they wanted to steal a good student away from ASU?    Idk.   Without that extra amount, there would not be an Oredigger in the family.  \n\nHousing situ on campus in 2018 was not great, they were tripling up in some of the trads. (Thomas was the one my oldest was in) then at the end of Freshman year, kicked out to go fend for yourself in Golden.    Rent is $900 X ( three people ) for a place along the bus line,  in S. Golden about 12mins from campus and the lease runs for a year.   \n\nWith a STEM degree, I'd say that about a new car's worth of student loans is acceptable.    30-50K max   Maybe if you're going to an MIT, Stanford / Berkeley then you can double that?  In those instances, IMHO you are paying for the location and the access to networking opportunities.   \n\nYounger son was waitlisted at Univ of Chicago, Wash U (St Louis), Vanderbilt (horrible year to try to get into schools because of covid slots from the prior year were held for people that got in, but delayed for a year dues to the height of the pandemic)    \n\nThe only other out of state school that came thru with fin. aid was Univ of Virginia, but the cost was even higher, and like in your situation, they would only award one scholarship. In that situation, ASU made much more financial sense as he would have been looking at 80K+ in loans for a  PoliSci/Economic/Business type of degree. \n\nNail the undergrad in Bozeman then work your way into Mines for grad school?  Or as other posters mentioned, do as many classes at the community college level and xfer into Mines to save money. \n\nLast summer, my oldest Son did his CompSci field session instead of an internship, and also took Chemistry online from ASU (to avoid having to deal with it his Senior year)   The pandemic paved the way for more liberal transfer policies at some schools",

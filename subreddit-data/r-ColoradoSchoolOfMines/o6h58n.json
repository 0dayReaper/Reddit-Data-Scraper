    "postText": "Hi, 34 year old woman currently attending Colorado School of Mines, looking for a roommate. I also work in software engineering.\n\nI am currently in a 2 bedroom near downtown Golden. I am looking to either move into the unit below me or find another 2 bedroom near the current area. I have a dog and can have one more dog at my current apartment. Looking for someone to move-in sometime between July and September.\n\nI don't drink or smoke, but don't mind whatever you do. I stay pretty busy and am also quiet. If you want your privacy I can 100% respect your wishes. I am low-key and just looking for someone that is the same.",

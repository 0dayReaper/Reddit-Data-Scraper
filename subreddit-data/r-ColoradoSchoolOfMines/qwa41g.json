    "postText": "I\u2019m adding courses for the summer on Geode, and I will most likely have an internship over the summer so I\u2019m only adding online/distance courses. One course has nothing under \u201cDay(s) &amp; Location(s)\u201d and the other says \u201cOnline NR\u201d, does that mean it\u2019s still asynchronous or will there be a zoom lecture? Or what makes those different?\n\nI swear this past summer if a course had \u201cOnline NR\u201d it still had scheduled zoom lectures but I didn\u2019t really care this past summer and didn\u2019t pay attention to that, and I (eventually) need to make sure any class I take is asynchronous",

            "comment": "Summer 21 is still View Only on trailhead which means you\u2019re looking at last year\u2019s course list. Same thing was true for spring 21 back in August, it didn\u2019t get updated until about a month before registration. So you should assume that most of the Remote/Distanced/Online NR courses will change to in-person, and they might even get shifted from summer 1 to summer 2 or have a different professor.\n\nRegistration for summer and next fall happens in the spring around March, so I\u2019d say by late January or early February it should be *mostly* up to date. I say mostly because last summer I signed up for 3 courses- one was shifted from in person to online 2 weeks before it started, another one was moved from summer 1-2 without warning, and the last one said unassigned so I had no idea who the prof was until day 1 of class. Unfortunately it\u2019s really hard to make any firm plans with the way mines summer sessions work, I\u2019ve had to call my employer multiple times every summer due to a spontaneous schedule change.",

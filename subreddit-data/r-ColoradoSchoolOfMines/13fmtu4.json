Like if they have a favorite quote see if you can find a nice wall decoration with the quote on it for their office. Or something silly if that\u2019s more their speed, like a coffee mug with an engineering joke on it or something. It\u2019s hard to recommend a gift when I don\u2019t know them.",

Another one gave me a felt microphone she made by hand (I teach speech and debate). Another group from my debate team gave me a coffee cup with their faces on it. \n\nI think as long as it\u2019s not over the top your professor will be thrilled with whatever you give them. I love all these gifts because they were given to me by my students and hopefully it means I made a difference. And I\u2019ll keep them forever.",

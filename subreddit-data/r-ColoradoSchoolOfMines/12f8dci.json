However, I\u2019ve heard many people say students have committed suicide for several reasons. I assumed that it was because it\u2019s a hard college overall. Can anyone confirm or give more detail on this? Thanks!",

Don\u2019t let that one factor keep you from coming though. If you are confident in your stress management skills and mental health, Mines isn\u2019t too bad.",

Yes it\u2019s expensive but you can leave at any time and shake things up if you really hate it. No reason to keep suffering if you truly cannot stand to be here.",

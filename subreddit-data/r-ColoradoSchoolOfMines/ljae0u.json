I\u2019m looking for a 1BR or studio apartment in the Morrison/Lakewood area since it\u2019s cheaper. If anyone has apartments they recommend or just good/bad experiences it would be great to know. Also, Mines Park Apartments seems decent so I\u2019m curious about that too. Thanks everyone.",

I don't think it's worth it for what you pay. Dice roll on whether or not you get AC, no in unit laundry, super fast internet but impossible to use the network for anything (smart home stuff barely works, can't run servers etc), wack ass covid rules, no weed if you're into that, no covered parking and there's been multiple times where my parking lot was just completely full so I've had to park far away from my apartment.\n\n The plus sides are the maintenance people are great and pretty quick if you have problems, decent amount of space, updated apartment with stone kitchen counters if you're lucky, nice bathroom and shower, close to campus. Overall I haven't hated my time here but I feel like I'm spending a fortune for how many amenities I don't have",

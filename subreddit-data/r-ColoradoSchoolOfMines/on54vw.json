They would give you 5000.\nUnless the scholarships are external, they won't stack them.",

Mines usually fairs pretty well in this kind of exercise, but if you can get a similar degree for half the price or something I\u2019d strongly consider that option.",

Looking at the data seems like a masters is needed to make decent money as there\u2019s a significant increase in pay compared to the $60k per year for bachelors. \n\nAny thoughts on the geological engineering major?",

Lower student debt will absolutely change your life in a great way. I'd go somewhere cheaper and focus heavily on internships, research projects, and networking events / job fairs. Sounds dumb and they're not fun things to participate in - but they help a ton. Good luck!",

In the end, what matters is your experience and work ethic. \nMines doesn't offer a lot of scholarships for out of state. Most of their really big ones require you to be a colorado resident, which is what mine required. \nBut, if you really really wanna go here, apply to as many outside scholarships as you can. I applied to about 20 and out of those 20 I got 4. And I wasn't even going to apply to those last 4, but I did anyway. \nDepending what your major is the SMART DoD is a good one and so is the Shell scholarship.",

If you think social distancing is \"security theater\" to \"enable narcs\" you're an idiot, people who genuinely care and understand the dangers of transmitting covid accidentally violate the guideline all the time.\n\nThe 4th amendment is to provide protections against unreasonable searches and seizures, requiring documentation to enter somewhere is not a search or a seizure. It is true that the government cannot arbitrarily intrude into your medical records. A border crossing or international flight is not an arbitrary action.\n\nMost of all you are not a court or a judge and it is not down to you to determine what is \"unconstitutional\". To be honest, I don't really give a shit what the constitution says if it is not in the interest of public health and safety.\n\nNew Zealand hasn't had to do a single lockdown measure for a year because - guess what - nobody whined about the constitution and everyone just followed lockdown guidelines for 2 weeks. It's selfish and actually harmful to both yourself and the society you participate in to not follow the public health guidelines.",

I stand for most of its principles, but as a document to be pointed to as a be-all and end-all for any justification or argument, it sucks ass.\n\nAlso it's not like right to protest is 100% absolutely protected anyway, public health and safety is already used as an excuse by local administrations and police to shut down protests and implement curfews.",

            "comment": "First off, the COVID-19 shot is **not** a vaccine. A vaccine, by definition, is a *\"suspension of weakened, killed, or fragmented microorganisms or toxins or of antibodies or lymphocytes that is administered primarily to prevent disease.\"* ([https://www.britannica.com/science/vaccine](https://www.britannica.com/science/vaccine))\n\nNormal vaccines cause the body's immune system (and **only** the immune system) to create its own antibodies, while this COVID-19 shot causes most, if not all, of the body's cells to produce a particular protein ***indefinitely***. This is unlike any vaccine that any of us took as kids, and the long-term effects of such a radical alteration are still unknown. \n\nSecond, this shot is **not** FDA-approved like other vaccines for precisely this reason. The normal FDA approval process for any new drug takes years. The COVID-19 shot is currently operating under what is known as an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). ([https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/eua/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/eua/index.html)) It is unclear whether it will ever get full FDA approval, but given the serious side effects associated with it so far (including Bell's Palsy, miscarriage, and death), I'm skeptical. Several countries have already banned certain variants of this shot because of the prevalence and seriousness of the side-effects. \n\nThird, because this shot is not FDA-approved (unlike the MMR vaccine that some of you mentioned), it **cannot** legally be mandated by any government agency or public institution. If you want a great example of this, the military can't even legally force service members to take it, and many are in fact opting out. ([https://whdh.com/news/us-military-says-third-of-troops-opt-out-of-being-vaccinated/](https://whdh.com/news/us-military-says-third-of-troops-opt-out-of-being-vaccinated/)) Many frontline health care workers are also refusing it (a recent number I saw said somewhere around 50% in some localities). Speaking as someone who was in the military and was forced to get vaccines throughout my career, I can tell you that if it was actually lawful to order a service member to take the COVID-19 shot, those that refuse would be getting prosecuted under the UCMJ (Uniform Code of Military Justice). They aren't because it isn't. It is also worth noting that Mines requires the MMR vaccine (or proof of immunity) because it is a **state** requirement...it's not something the college implemented on its own.\n\nThis leads directly into my fourth point: proof of immunity (antibodies) can serve in lieu of taking a vaccine. When I first enrolled at Mines, my vaccination records did not show that I had the MMR vaccine. However, I didn't ultimately need to take the vaccine because I had blood work done which proved my immunity. My wife had the same thing happen during the immigration process. She didn't have a particular required vaccination in her records, but because her blood tests showed an immunity the requirement was satisfied without her having to take the vaccine. Never in any of this discussion of the COVID-19 shot have I heard anyone talk about proof of immunity being used, which is actually the norm for every other disease that has a vaccination requirement associated with it. The reality is that many, if not most, of us have already been exposed to COVID-19 and have antibodies, so if Mines is genuinely only concerned about the safety of its students and faculty, then a blood titer showing COVID-19 antibodies should allow a student to attend in-person classes. If this is not the case, then it proves that the Mines administration is more concerned with toeing a political line than making decisions based off of data and evidence.\n\nWhich leads into my final point: ***informed consent***. This is especially important given the COVID-19 shot's **experimental** status - the Nuremberg Code absolutely applies here. According to the Code, *\"The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, overreaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision.\" (*[*http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/nuremberg/*](http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/nuremberg/)*)*\n\nMost of us at Mines are training to be either pure scientists or engineers. As such, we are expected to not only make decisions based on evidence, data, and sound reasoning, but also to conduct ourselves in an ethical manner. (If not then why did we all have to take Nature and Human Values?) The ethics of informed consent involves a patient/subject to be **fully informed** as to the risks and side-effects associated with **any** medical treatment or experimentation. It is up to each of us to do our due diligence and decide for ourselves whether or not we consent to taking an experimental drug. It is simply not the place (either ethically or legally) of any governmental agency or educational institution. If the administration of Mines has any respect for the values and ethics that it teaches (and supposedly cherishes) as well as for the law, it will not even attempt to make an experimental and non-FDA approved drug a requirement. (Somehow I suspect they won't, because like all for-profit institutions, they have a desire to avoid lawsuits and bad press.)\n\nEach of us has the responsibility to think for ourselves and make our own determinations and not base our decisions off of what a career bureaucrat on TV or in a college administrator's office tells us is good for us.  I myself will not be getting this shot under any circumstances.",

They do cause your cells to produce the spike protein, but only for the amount of mRNA delivered.  The Johnson&amp;Johnson uses established vaccine technology (and not mRNA), so it's interesting that you don't disambiguate.\n\nThe definition you're using would also exclude the smallpox vaccine, which caused an actual infection with a much less dangerous virus.  That one let us wipe out one of the deadliest widespread viruses ever.\n\n&gt; Second, this shot is not FDA-approved like other vaccines for precisely this reason.\n\nWrong reason.  They're only approved for emergency use because \"years\" is far too long in a major pandemic.  And the non-FDA approval isn't a secret.  It's repeatedly emphasized in the information packet they give you before you get a shot.\n\n&gt; (including Bell's Palsy, miscarriage, and death)\n\nSource?  A few people have died after the AstraZeneca vaccine, which isn't in use in the US--and it was all over the news.

So we don't have to worry about Mines mandating it until the FDA actually does approve it.  I'm not sure how this is a problem.\n\nIncidentally, I need neither a career bureaucrat nor a college administrator to tell me to uphold my role in the social contract by contributing to herd immunity.  I have had COVID, but the long-term immunity effects are as yet unknown.  As a general adherent to the social contract, I believe it is appropriate to make every contribution to the possibility of ending this pandemic, regardless of mandates.",

                            "comment": "Smallpox has a mortality rate of \\~30% in unvaccinated individuals ([https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/clinicians/clinical-disease.html](https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/clinicians/clinical-disease.html)). That is *huge*. According to updated CDC COVID-19 data published March 19, 2021, **the current best estimate of the infection fatality ratio for those in the 18-49 age group is 0.05%** ([https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html#table-1](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html#table-1) \\- Table 1). Most, if not ALL, of the student body at Mines falls into this age group. Even the 50-64 age group, which some (or many) of the faculty may fall into, has an infection fatality ratio of only 0.6%. COVID-19 is ***not even close*** to being as dangerous as Smallpox and characterizing it as a \"major pandemic\" is laughable, or at least it would be if I didn't know people unironically do.\n\nSpeaking of side-effects, it's interesting that you mention the J&amp;J shot considering that multiple injection sites in the U.S. (including one right here in Colorado) have had to close due to people having adverse reactions to this brand specifically ([https://kdvr.com/news/dicks-sporting-goods-park-vaccine-site-shut-down-after-patients-experience-adverse-reactions-to-vaccine/](https://kdvr.com/news/dicks-sporting-goods-park-vaccine-site-shut-down-after-patients-experience-adverse-reactions-to-vaccine/) ; [https://www.theepochtimes.com/4th-us-site-pauses-covid-19-vaccinations-after-adverse-reactions\\_3770213.html/amp](https://www.theepochtimes.com/4th-us-site-pauses-covid-19-vaccinations-after-adverse-reactions_3770213.html/amp)). Leaving aside whatever role (if any) the mRNA delivery method plays in the side-effects, there is compelling data that points to the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) in both the Moderna and Pfizer shots as being a major contributing factor in the adverse reactions associated with these injections ([https://www.oyetimes.com/views/columns/330446-polyethylene-glycol-the-prize-in-every-vial-of-covid-19-vaccine](https://www.oyetimes.com/views/columns/330446-polyethylene-glycol-the-prize-in-every-vial-of-covid-19-vaccine)). Apparently PEG has ***never*** before been approved in a vaccine, and much of the population has been sensitized to it due to it being ubiquitous in household and food products ([https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/polyethylene-glycol](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/polyethylene-glycol)). Somehow I don't think this bodes well for these shots eventually getting full FDA approval.\n\nMost people don't get vaccinated (or get their children vaccinated) against diseases with a high mortality rate (ex. Smallpox) out of some desire to \"adhere to the social contract\"....they do it out of self-interest and a desire to avoid unnecessary suffering (either their own or their children's). With a disease like Smallpox it makes sense to get vaccinated because there is a substantial chance that one could die fighting off the actual disease without already having antibodies. Given the current data and evidence, the same cannot be said about COVID-19. Most people who contract COVID-19 have mild symptoms, which would tend to reduce the fatality rate even further considering that many such individuals don't even go to the doctor for treatment and thus don't get counted as COVID \"cases\". Given the extremely low mortality rate in every demographic (*except* the elderly and those that have complicating comorbidities) and given that, unlike the Smallpox and MMR vaccines, the COVID-19 shot is not only unproven but is also increasingly being linked to adverse side-effects, the juice simply is not worth the squeeze. \n\nThe reality is that herd immunity is not a \"strategy\" that humans implement, it is something that happens naturally and continuously over the course of human evolution. Herd immunity occurred countless times before germ theory was ever a thing and before humans figured out vaccination, and it will happen with COVID-19 regardless of how many individuals do or don't get these shots. In fact, even going by the PCR test  - which the man who won the Nobel Prize for inventing it points out is being grossly misused and misinterpreted ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPs86XB1OjE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPs86XB1OjE)) - cases of COVID-19 continue to decline ([https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home)), even in places that have lifted (or never had) COVID-19 related restrictions (ex. Florida, Texas, Sweden, etc.). \n\nGiven all this, it is absolutely reasonable and fair to say that a valid evidenced-based argument for **forcing** individuals to get any one of the experimental COVID-19 shots as a prerequisite for them to just continue going about their daily lives does not exist. The only arguments I hear are based on appeals to emotion and/or virtue signalling, neither of which have any place in the rational application of the scientific method. \n\nIn the spirit of informed consent, why isn't the Mines administration including any of this in their \"Mines Climbs Together\" updates? What happened to the risk analysis that we are all taught to do as aspiring scientists/engineers? What happened to comparing the likelihood of an event happening to its severity? According to the data from the CDC, which is one of the authorities whose data institutions like Mines are supposedly basing their decisions on, if an average Mines student doesn't get the shot and contracts COVID-19 they not only have a 99.95% chance of surviving it, but they also a 0% chance of experiencing any of the adverse reactions which are increasingly prevalent with these experimental injections. Yet all we are hearing from the administration is, \"Vaccines = good. Get vaccinated.\" Why?\n\nWhile you are correct that Mines is a public college, increasing revenue is a top priority for the Mines Foundation and Board of Trustees. This is exactly why they brought PCJ in from Arizona State, and it is also why he made such a big push pre-COVID to cram as many students as possible into classes (arguably to the detriment of educational quality). It isn't difficult to connect the dots and come to the conclusion that, in the interest of the bottom line, the Mines administration is doing exactly what \"good\" bureaucrats/politicians do....they are taking the most politically expedient path of least resistance. While I am not surprised by this in the least,  it is still nonetheless extremely disappointing coming from an institution that tries to put forth the appearance of being devoted to STEM and the scientific method, which among other things requires constant (and ***public***) debate, discussion, and scrutiny of assertions, hypotheses, and the decisions based on them. \n\nI stand by my determination to not needlessly risk endangering my health by getting an experimental shot for a virus that I have almost no chance of dying from should I contract it (if I haven't already).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#",

Just that the cited definition of \"vaccine\" would exclude the smallpox vaccine.\n\n&gt; Speaking of side-effects, it's interesting that you mention the J&amp;J shot considering that multiple injection sites in the U.S. (including one right here in Colorado) have had to close due to people having adverse reactions to this brand specifically\n\nA handful of people reported effects such as nausea and dizziness.  Two people (out of 1700) went to the ER and were released the same day.  And \"By Thursday evening, state health officials said they were confident there was nothing wrong with the vaccine and that clinics would go forward.\" [source](https://www.cpr.org/2021/04/08/colorado-covid-vaccine-clinics-johnson-johnson-reactions-update/).  I myself got the J&amp;J the very next day.\n\n&gt; there is compelling data that points to the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) in both the Moderna and Pfizer shots as being a major contributing factor in the adverse reactions associated with these injections \n\nThe concern with PEG appears to be allergic reactions.  That's why they have you wait for 15 minutes, but severe allergic reactions appear to be very rare.  Judging by the 15-minute thing, they have the same concern with such routine practices as the flu vaccine.\n\n&gt; Most people don't get vaccinated (or get their children vaccinated) against diseases with a high mortality rate (ex. Smallpox) out of some desire to \"adhere to the social contract\"...\n\nI wasn't arguing that that *is* the typical motivation.  Just that it *should be* relevant.  (Incidentally, the same age range that's safest from COVID-19 is still expected to register for the Selective Service.  I think I can legitimately object to it theoretically being possible to send me off to some foreign war against my will, but not to expect people to get a vaccine in order to attend a university.  COVID-19 has been a much bigger problem for the US than our eventual defeat in Vietnam was.)\n\n&gt; cases of COVID-19 continue to decline (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home)\n\nDid you read your own source?  The nationwide case rate started to increase in mid-March and has continued to do so.\n\n&gt; The reality is that herd immunity is not a \"strategy\" that humans implement, it is something that happens naturally and continuously over the course of human evolution. Herd immunity occurred countless times before germ theory was ever a thing and before humans figured out vaccination, and it will happen with COVID-19 regardless of how many individuals do or don't get these shots\n\nSure.  The question--as has been pointed out countless times since people started talking about this a year ago--is how long it will take and how many lives will be lost.  Oh, and how many new, nastier mutations we get in the process (some of which are quite capable of reinfecting people).\n\n&gt; Given all this, it is absolutely reasonable and fair to say that a valid evidenced-based argument for forcing individuals to get any one of the experimental COVID-19 shots as a prerequisite for them to just continue going about their daily lives does not exist. \n\nWhich is fine, because the present context is not a universal mandate, and that has never been (that I know of) a popular proposal in the US.  The kind of vaccine mandates we're talking about are a simple exercise of free association.\n\n&gt; 99.95% chance of surviving it, but they also a 0% chance of experiencing any of the adverse reactions which are increasingly prevalent with these experimental injections. Yet all we are hearing from the administration is, \"Vaccines = good. Get vaccinated.\" Why?\n\nBecause so far, lethal adverse reactions (like the blood clotting issues with AZ and J&amp;J) are on the order of 1 in a million, and everything else goes away within a week.  That's called a good decision.\n\n&gt; I stand by my determination to not needlessly risk endangering my health by getting an experimental shot for a virus that I have almost no chance of dying from should I contract it (if I haven't already).\n\nAnd I stand by my stance that refusing to accept a vanishingly small personal risk in exchange for hastening the end of a pandemic and reducing the risk of dangerous mutations is a dick move.",

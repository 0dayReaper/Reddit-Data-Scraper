    "postText": "As graduation approaches, I couldn't help but notice the class rings on the link our school sent out for our caps and gowns. It got me thinking - have any of you considered getting one? I must admit that it's never really been on my radar until now, but the idea of having a tangible keepsake to commemorate this significant milestone is starting to grow on me.\n\nPersonally, I would only consider getting a class ring for sentimental reasons. It would be a meaningful symbol of my academic achievement, especially since I will be the first in my family to attain the highest level of education. However, I am still undecided and would love to hear your opinions on whether it's worth the investment. So, what do you think - is a class ring a worthwhile memento to mark this important occasion in my case?",

            "comment": "I considered getting a class ring also for sentimental reasons since I'll be the first in my family to graduate college. I am honestly still occasionally considering it, but the $600 price tag is very unconvincing. \n\nHowever, it is YOUR graduation to commemorate. If you are able to and really feel the sentimental value in it, then go for it. I know personally, I want something to commemorate that achievement that no one has been able to do in my family and having a symbol of that to remember to be grateful I got that opportunity is important to me. If the item for you is a class ring, then you should go for it if you are able to, regardless of what everyone else thinks.",

Instead I worked with an artist on Etsy (I can link them if you're interested) and they were very involved with the design. I got to customize it to my style but only $99, way less than the ones Mines offers. I wear it every day and love it.",

I graduated over ten years ago and I\u2019ve never seen anyone my age with one.\n\nI figured I gave the school enough money.\n\nAlso my brother\u2019s an ER doctor. His stories really put me off rings of any kind. My wedding ring is silicone. It\u2019s the only ring I\u2019ll wear.",

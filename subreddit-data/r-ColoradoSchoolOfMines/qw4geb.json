I work on a team that builds software in c++ that runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android. We buy whatever machine developers are comfortable on as a primary dev box and most of them choose Mac because the tooling (XCode, lldb, llvm) is so good and it's very portable. Mac has built in python and shell interpreters so build systems and utilities can be written that run on other systems as well. This is not to say you can't develop software on Windows (clearly you can!), just that a lot of developers choose to develop on Mac even when they have a choice.",

I would **love** to hear some preparation stories from some of the students here!\n\nI am fully aware how Mines preps students to like go into the workforce immediately. I know I\u2019m like super young but I\u2019m just wondering out of pure curiosity how it would turn out! I\u2019m planning to do a PhD and aware of the 4+1 program at Mines as well but yeah!",

            "comment": "Current PhD student here who did not do undergrad at Mines, but thought I'd chime in and say we have several undergrad researchers in our lab, and typically you just email the professor whose research you think is interesting to see if they have spots open. Most labs I know of have undergrads that work in them. Typically you get your name on papers you helped contribute to, so that's pretty helpful for grad school applications.\n\nThere is also an undergrad research symposium every spring for undergrads to present their research, which is great experience as well.",

            "comment": "Hi there,\n\nI went to Mines as an EE undergraduate and went to UC Berkeley for graduate school. \n\nThere were a couple of things I did throughout my time at Mines that helped me be able to get into my dream school. Being a graduate student is different than being an undergraduate student, and so I took advantages of some opportunities to get a feel for what it would be like. I was engaged in research and on-campus activities such as Hyperloop. I found that despite it being challenging, it was honestly very cool to be at the forefront of novel research that could potentially have a great impact not just in STEM but for society. I also took EE classes with graduate students and so I was able to get a feel for what the expectations for them were. \n\nOne thing I highly recommend is to go to office hours. I frequently went to office hours not only to get help on homework but to also to get to know professors. It will pay off in the future because if the professor knows you and you did good in their class, they will write you a very stellar letter of recommendation. Professors at Mines are very supportive, no matter if you are going into industry or graduate school. \n\nLet me know if you have questions. I will be happy to answer them.",

            "comment": "Current Undergrad here at Mines who has recently been accepted to grad school! I will say that Mines does a really good job at preparing students for the grad school route. One example that I took advantage of is the MURF fellowship, an undergraduate research fellowship that gives a student the opportunity to partake in a variety of research projects with a professor of his choice. Of course, like some have stated, you would initially have had prior communication with the professor of Interest before singing up to the project. The experience leads you through integral skills you will need as a grad student apart from just research such as being able to present, independence, and poster making to name a few...You even get paid!",

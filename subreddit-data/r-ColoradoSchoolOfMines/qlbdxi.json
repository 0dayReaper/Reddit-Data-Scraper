    "postText": " Registration is approaching and these classes are still a tossup for me - Chemistry 2 or Molecular Engineering and Materials Chemistry? I\u2019m an Engineering Physics major so this decision doesn\u2019t have much bearing on my overall course - I\u2019m just curious to see if anyone else has any insight or advice on which of these is better. Neither sounds particularly more interesting than the other. I\u2019ve also only taken calc 1/chem 1 thus far. Thanks!",

Id say the way thermodynamics is presented from a microscopic view, emergence of material properties, and the examples from solid state systems you'd see again.",

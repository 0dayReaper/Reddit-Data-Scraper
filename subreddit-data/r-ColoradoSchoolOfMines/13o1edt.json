            "comment": "If you\u2019re doing CS things that don\u2019t require solid works (controversial opinion ahead), perhaps consider a MacBook of some type. They have a native Unix shell and when combined with a package manager (home brew is good) you can do all of the Linux things you need to do, including utilize native ssh and stuff like that. \n\nFor the windows side of things, a general good recommendation is a Lenovo of some description. The Yoga and ThinkPad lines are both dependable and well balanced in terms of features and power. They hold up well to physical abuse than many of the offerings from HP or DELL. Less deck flex when typing powerfully. That may not seem like a huge deal, but sturdiness can absolutely save your butt if you accidentally drag it off a table or drop your backpack. 2 in 1s are great, so the yoga line, because you can use OneNote to combine your bag full of notebooks into your computer and a single stylus. Good shit. \n\nIn terms of specs, I would recommend to be generous in specc. No less than 16gigs of Ram, especially if you plan to do any kind of mobile SolidWorks, programming or utilizing any other high powered software on your personal machine. The school has labs that are equipped for you to do solidworks and stuff on if you decide a Mac is the best choice, but keep your major and interest path in mind when choosing a device. 512 gigs of storage is generous, but you will realize you\u2019ll use more storage than you think with all those canvas downloads for assignments. \nTake advantage of the huge storage space provided by the one drive under your Mines account when you get it. You can map the Z-drive in your personal machine to the one drive so you can access school files as if you are sitting at a lab computer.\nRyzen 5 or higher and i5 or higher preferably in terms of CPU. Dedicated graphics isn\u2019t necessarily a must but if you\u2019re going the gaming laptop route, you\u2019ll probably be specing those anyway.\n\nGet something with good IO. Lots of ports. USB, A and C. HDMI if possible. micro Sd slots are great. If you can\u2019t do that. Get a good dongle or dock that has those ports.Also super helpful to connect to on campus displays or put files on Sd cards for 3D printing if those are things you want to do. \nOther stuff comes down to personal opinion.\nHope this helps",

Definitely get a Windows machine, unless you're a Linux guru in training (and expect that to meet some friction here and there, as Linux will do). Nothing ChromeOS or MacOS.\n\nAny \"intense engineering software\" you might need to run, you'll likely be using in a computer lab rather than on your own machine. [Here's the system requirements for SolidWorks](https://www.solidworks.com/support/system-requirements), which you'll need for EPICS. But again, just use it in a computer lab. It's a bitch and a half to remove from your PC, it leaves behind a tun of junk even after running the uninstaller (or at least it did several years ago).\n\nOther than that, just make sure it can run League of Legends or whatever  online game college students play these days.\n\nLenovo is a great brand right now. They make a lot of business-grade laptops that are absolute workhorses. You can usually find refurbished ones that have minor cosmetic damage for a *huge* discount. My personal laptop was like 40% off because the [Trackpoint-style Pointer](https://xkcd.com/243/) was a little worn out.",

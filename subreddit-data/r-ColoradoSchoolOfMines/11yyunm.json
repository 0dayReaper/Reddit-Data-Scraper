It seems like quite a few people just *hate* it at Mines. Common complaints have been overworking, lack of support for students/poor student life, bad food and classes.\n\nWhat has your experience been? Are these just the inevitable few who didn't like a good college, or is it really such a bad place?",

Places like Reddit will pretty much always breed negativity\u2014 people don\u2019t exclaim about how much they love the school, but they feel motivated to cry out when they hate it. \n\nLike many, many other similar institutions, Mines has its issues. There\u2019s an incredible lack of diversity, a downtrend this year in acceptances of minority and female-identifying students, and a campus culture that pushes you to your working limits without the resources to back you up.\n\nAll of that said (and really please soak in those topics, I\u2019m not just rattling off complaints, these are serious issues), Mines has been a positive experience for me overall. There are plenty of opportunities to grow, learn, and party (if you know where to look). You have a personal freedom at Mines that will let you succeed in any department. This year, I worked as a Resident Advisor, which isn\u2019t something I would do if I hated the school. I\u2019m also LGBTQ+, and while the campus culture in that regard isn\u2019t amazing, it\u2019s certainly not unbearable. \n\nAll that to say that Mines will be what you make of it. It\u2019s not some STEM kid utopia generating the strongest minds of our generation, just a bunch of people figuring themselves out like any college, maybe slightly better at math than most. Keep the acceptance in your back pocket in case you hear back from other schools.",

You have to work harder here for something than you would at most other institutions, it\u2019s true. At the end of the day though, when you get that piece of paper for suffering (and I use the word suffer endearingly) through 4 years here, it means something. The other thing too is that everyone around you is going through the same stuff as you. If you don\u2019t know how or aren\u2019t sure about the school provided support system, create a support system for yourself by surrounding yourself with people who are smarter than you and you enjoy spending time with them. And there will be lots of people here that are smarter than you. Hope this helps.",

I just didn\u2019t get the correct advising and support I needed, now I\u2019m a senior graduating with a degree in a field I want nothing to do with. I even got an apology from my department head saying he was sorry that I was failed so badly in terms of advising.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t like Mines or a good/challenging college, the lack of student support has just been extremely disappointing and to me that\u2019s unacceptable. I\u2019m just happy I\u2019m graduating, the friends I started with in my program ended up dropping out.\n\nIf I could go back, I wouldn\u2019t choose Mines. I regret my choice, but it\u2019s not like I knew it would be this way. I have a lot of built up resentment but I\u2019m not trying to scare you away, I think a lot of it is based on department, advisors, etc. Please trust your gut and don\u2019t let anyone pressure you into doing something you\u2019re not sure about (I\u2019m talking about professors here), stand your ground, make sure you\u2019re doing what you love to motivate yourself through the tough times, and please have a hobby.\n\nAbout the hobby\u2026 seriously. Everyone says that, but I\u2019m graduating with regrets not only because I have a degree I don\u2019t want, but because I didn\u2019t even do anything fun or make good memories along the way. All I did was work and it definitely paid off (I\u2019m starting my PhD in the fall somewhere else for something else) but it wasn\u2019t worth ALL the things I missed out on either.

            "comment": "A bit late, but I wanted to write this before you have to commit. When I applied to colleges, I applied to about a dozen different schools, mostly in-state. The only school I got accepted to was Colorado School of Mines, an out of state school, so I didn't really have much of a choice in where I enrolled. Knowing what I know now, if I could go back and choose which college I would attend, I would have just ducked my head down, went on the community college to higher education university track instead of enrolling in Mines, and saved myself a bunch of tuition money in the process. You should know these things about the school before enrolling:\n\n1. There aren't that many clubs at Mines, especially hobby related ones, and the ones that are hobby-related struggle to get any funding from the administration.  A lot of this stems from the smaller student body, something I was worried about when I enrolled in this school and a major reason why I want to transfer to a larger school. There are of course things you can get involved in around the Denver area but considering that other colleges do a better job of having a good academics-extracurriculars balance without having to leave their campus, that's not saying much. It's even worse if you don't have a car since it's near impossible to go anywhere fun or interesting without one (if you do end up going here and you don't have a car, make sure to become friends with someone who does, otherwise you'll be stuck in Golden all year since public transportation around the area is lacking).\n2. Very few of the classes are hands-on, at least until the very end of your time getting your undergrad here. I'm finishing up my first junior-level courses and I've only had three courses (out of around \\~24) that could be considered hands-on while the rest have been completely pen and paper theoretical. For comparison, my older sibling who got the same degree as me (mechanical engineering) from a different prestigious but not completely engineering-oriented school like Mines, had taken at least six hands-on courses by the time he got to my same standing credit-wise. As previously mentioned, there's not many hobby-related, hands-on clubs so getting that kind of experience is definitely a bit harder despite our school's insistence to the contrary and will largely be dependent upon yourself if you choose to attend Mines.\n3. Kinda goes with the lack of clubs but there are very few appealing elective classes to help balance the rigorous academics. There are music and writing classes which are nice, but they're fairly difficult to balance because of how much work and commitment are required on top of a typical engineering workload (speaking from personal experience). Again, not unique to this school, just more of what comes with the engineering experience. That said there are very few lower-commitment electives or art classes that would help offset this. The only ones that fall into that category are the glassblowing and knife making classes, which are both extremely limited due to the small size of the hot shop on campus, and the knife making class mainly gives priority to MME majors. Meanwhile, most typical colleges have tons of elective classes in things like pottery, painting, etc. that help alleviate stress. Compound this with the lack of clubs and you get a pretty lopsided work-life balance at Mines.\n4. I and most people I know are having a pretty difficult time actually getting any internships or engineering job experience. Unfortunately, having Mines listed on your application doesn't exactly mean employers will be jumping at the chance to interview and employ you. As far as I can tell most people work temporary jobs for their first two summers and then maybe secure an internship after their junior year. Once again, not unique to this college (my aforementioned brother did exactly that despite an impressive academic and extracurricular record), but I still have to question how people conclude that Mines is better than other schools for employment prospects. Maybe I'll change my mind after actually graduating and entering the industry but for now it really doesn't seem much better than your typical 4-year university. Doesn't help that Mines is essentially unheard of outside of Colorado as far as I am aware (coming from a Californian).\n5. The people at the school are fine but they aren't all \"one big community\". People say that the smaller class size leads to better and more tightly-knit community compared to larger schools, and while I can see where they're coming from, that simply has not been the experience in my case. I've tried to join friend groups but they always fell apart or splintered into smaller friend groups, often due to the pressure of school making it hard to stay together. Of course this can mean you might have a really tight-knit group of 2-3 other people but don't expect the super large friend groups that  may have had in high school. If your social life in college is at all a priority to you, I would advise to steer clear of Mines. If anything, I've been closer socially to my old high school friends than anyone I've interacted with at Mines. Part of the problem is that I've found it difficult to actually get into existing friend groups especially if you don't have any common ground. As far as I can tell, if you don't find your community or friend group by your junior year than it will be much harder to do so later on. For what its worth, I've made a lot of memories and done a lot of cool things at Mines but for the most part have made them alone. Being at Mines didn't necessarily make it any easier to make these memories and I could have made them at any other school. I haven't exactly met my \"life-long friends\" or had epic, life-changing experiences that people are always going on about. Maybe it'll change after I get out of college or if I transfer to a different university but right now I'm pretty dissatisfied socially.\n6. The mental health services here are pretty poor. They're underfunded and understaffed especially considering the amount of students who have mental health issues. Since I am from out of state, I can't use my insurance to pay for typical therapy and so I've tried to use the school's resources but anything past short-term therapy is difficult to obtain. A lot of this is compounded by the aforementioned issues, so again I would definitely consider your options carefully if mental health is at all a priority.\n\nAll of this is to say that Mines has been a disappointment and is simply not worth the price they charge. If they charged less in tuition or I was an in-state student, than I probably wouldn't have as many grievances. Its not like there hasn't been any positive parts about the school, but considering how much tuition I'm paying, the cost of traveling between home and school, and the toll its taken on my mental health, Mines really doesn't seem that much better compared to other schools. If anything it seems less so, so really make sure you consider your options before deciding where to enroll at. That said, I already put in my transfer application for schools back home.\n\nTLDR: Save your money and attend a different serviceable 4-year university: same tough engineering workload and prestige, better academics-life balance.",

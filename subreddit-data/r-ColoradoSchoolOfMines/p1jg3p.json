I know its a very good engineering school however I haven\u2019t seen much people talk about biochemistry. I plan to go to medical school and don\u2019t want to hurt myself financially. If anyone could help me out I\u2019d appreciate it a lot!",

            "comment": "I can't speak to your question directly because I'm not familliar with the biochemistry program, but I would recommend an engineering track over a science track for a pre-Med, but that's just me.   I think the engineering mindset is sorely lacking in the medical field.     So I'd recommend the biological engineering specialty in the chemical engineering department, but that's just my 2 cents.\n\nAlso, LOL at \"I plan to go to medical school and don\u2019t want to hurt myself financially.\"    Sorry, I don't mean to poke fun, but those two statements seem completely against each other.",

            "comment": "The biochemistry department is still extremely brand new and while I am a ChemE student, I have a couple of friends in biochem currently that struggle since the department isn't as fleshed out as other departments on campus. However, I believe every major at Mines is difficult but fulfilling in their own ways. There's so much hands-on experience you can get here and the electives are extremely helpful as well if you want to learn more about a specific topic. I just want to emphasize again that this is a new department at Mines, so if you're looking for something well-established that you know will be worth your money, I would personally go elsewhere. However, there are plenty of research opportunities here at Mines in the medicine field since pre-med is a popular track for ChemEs (there is specifically a biomedical minor if I'm not wrong under the ChemE department). There are plenty of advantages and disadvantages, but in the end, it's all up to you. Good luck on your search and I hope more people can provide more significant information!",

Not only do you learn the core things that more premeds learn (ochem, biochem, physics), you have the option of going into engineering if you wish.\n\nThe ChemE dept also has Norrgran, who is an MD and was a neurosurgeon. I was a ChemE with a BiomedE minor, and am currently going to grad school at Anschutz (Structural Biology &amp; Biochemistry), so that can show you what a med oriented track is for a chemE",

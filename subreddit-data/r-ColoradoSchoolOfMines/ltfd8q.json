Everyone fails tests, even multiple choice tests (which can be very difficult if written well). The important thing is figuring out what you need to do to better understand the material, take a couple days off to recover when you can, and then get back to it.",

Many of us who got accepted into Mines were used to being the smartest, having the best grades, and just having things come to us naturally. What you find out is that it really does take a lot of work and effort on your part here.  I enrolled in a bounce back course that's helped me figure out better study habits and techniques. You'll find out that you aren't the only one going through the same feelings. Learn from the mistakes, figure out what you did wrong and do your best to understand the material. I know it can be hard, but reaching out to classmates, going to office hours and using those resources will be helpful. It's better to do it sooner than later. I found that out the hard way. Do your best to hang in there, keep your head up and keep persevering. You're not alone in the boat feeling this way. Work on that time management, setting aside time for hw/studying but don't forget to give yourself breaks (this helps with the brain drain) Self-care is important. I just got some test results back and they're not the greatest, but you still have time to turn it around. We're all human and we're not perfect.",

My physics 1 class didn't transfer, and my second time taking it at Mines was significantly harder than my first time taking it elsewhere (and I finished with a worse grade the second time).\n\nThe average Mines class is almost as hard as an honors class--meaning an honors program you actually had to apply to etc, not honors math that anyone can take here--where I did my freshman year.  The sort of students who got close to a full-ride merit scholarship there (most people in the honors program) would be a bit above average at Mines.",

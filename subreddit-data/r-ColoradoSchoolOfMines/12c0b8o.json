See the syllabus on our site!\n\n[http://syllabuddies.com](http://syllabuddies.com)\n\nRight now all syllabi are student contributed and we would really appreciate it if you could upload any classes that you have taken but are not listed.\n\nThis is a project for an upper level CS course and we are still developing the site, so let me know if you have any feedback on the structure, interface, or overall experience :)",

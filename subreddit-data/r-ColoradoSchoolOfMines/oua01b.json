Because I kinda want to get a commuter meal plan, but i don't think it would be worth it if mines market is take out only or whatever. I dont even know if commuter meal plans were a thing last year. Thanks.",

The hours that they serve is pretty strict, but that may also be because it\u2019s summer. I\u2019m getting the cheaper commuter plan this semester myself",

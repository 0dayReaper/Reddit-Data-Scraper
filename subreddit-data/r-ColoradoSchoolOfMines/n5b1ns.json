            "comment": "2nd row is optimal: close enough to the front to feel engaged and participate, but small distractions like pulling out your phone for a short amount of time or saying something quietly to the person next to you don't carry as much guilt.\n\n You can also look at the back of the heads of the people in front of you. I don't know why but when there's no one in front of me, classroom boredom is way worse. The 2nd row is just ideal: feel immersed and included socially in the room (people on all sides) and maintain a somewhat engaged relationship with the instructor, all while taking the forefront focus off yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTry to sit next to someone that seems like they aren't amazing at the class but will do the work: best study/homework partners. If you see someone sitting with their laptop open and they're running any form of linux or have discord open in full windowed mode, do not sit next to them. Even if it's a computer science class.",

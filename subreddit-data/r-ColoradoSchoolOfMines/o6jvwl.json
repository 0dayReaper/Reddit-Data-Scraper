Everything I\u2019ve heard implies that we\u2019re starting 12 July. Anybody know what those two days are?",

If you\u2019re receiving this message, you\u2019re currently enrolled in the Second Field Session for Chemical and Biological Engineering (CBEN 312/313, Unit Operations Laboratory). I\u2019m sending this message with an update regarding the beginning of our course instruction.\n \nAs you may recall from the original (Jan/Feb) Field Session entrance survey, the 2nd Field Session was originally planned to commence on July 5, as our long-running custom is to begin Field II on the Monday following the 4th of July holiday. This year, Independence Day falls on a Sunday, and the University Calendar Committee decided that Monday, July 5 would be the observed day for the holiday, and campus would be closed. Since our schedule is strictly aligned across multiple weeks, this would disrupt our execution of the course.\n \nSo, I\u2019m writing today to notify you that the course will begin exactly one week later \u2013 our orientation will be on campus at 9 AM on Monday, July 12. More information will follow on the course Canvas site when it is published in advance of our session kickoff. Please let me know if you have any questions \u2013 the only other detail I\u2019d like to provide is that, although the course is listed for six total weeks, the sixth week is a contingency week that is only used for instruction/student activity if there is a catastrophic infrastructure failure that disables all or part of the Unit Operations Lab. I have been at Mines since 2012, and we have not had the occasion to use this contingency week at all. Please expect that the course will end for student activity on Friday, August 13.\n \nWe\u2019ll see you all, in person, on July 12!\n \nSincerely,\nJason",

It seems like a common sentiment that it's harder to meet new people nowadays, so a friend of mine just started one for finding friends! It's called Burros &amp; Miners and it's not perfect, but it's an attempt at somewhat methodically connecting current and prospective students during Covid and we haven't found anything like it.\n\nYou submit a survey with interests, hobbies, and a few open-ended questions. For the people who are looking for study buddies, it also asks about majors and graduation years. You can give whatever contact info you're comfortable sharing, so I'd encourage anyone to join even if they're not on social media much.\n\n[Instagram (@burrosandminers)](https://www.instagram.com/burrosandminers/)\n\n[Google Form](https://forms.gle/TpLrXM1SvBsxCe8k7)",

The multiple choice questions about conversation topics and activities will help with the basics, but we're also just going to read through the free response questions and match people based on their answers. Hopefully knowing about some similar interests will help!",

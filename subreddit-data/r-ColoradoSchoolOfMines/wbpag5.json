            "comment": "Mines admitted to too many kids. They said they cut down on how many they accepted but too many enrolled. Anyways, that's out of our control. What you can do is find what class you're missing and reach out to the professor that teaches it. The professors are your best advocate and will likely be able to help and/or give great advice on what you should do.\n\nAnd if you're really worried - which you totally have a right to be - call the registrar or schedule a meeting with your CASA advisor. I suggest you call, not your parents. When I called, I was able to get enough information out of the registrar to work with my professors and advisor to figure out my schedule.\n\nHopefully this helps and good luck!",

Take a look at your degree audit on Trailhead and talk to CASA when your schedule is released if you have questions about what else to try to waitlist for\u2014or what you can just take next semester!",

Depending on what credits you received from things such as AP tests, you might not have that many general classes left to take.

Mines GenEd weed-out courses can be tough and having 12 credits might be a blessing to get through those and figure out a social life.

Once the semester starts you\u2019ll be able to talk to CASA and sign up for more courses. For reference they signed me up for 18 credit hours my first semester, so CASA is all over the place. Also, I was a freshman last year and part of the \u201clargest freshman class\u201d which just meant not enough dorms or classes. It\u2019s gonna be rough, good luck.",

I wouldn't go beyond 1 class there especially since you're enrolled full-time at Mines, it can be exhausting, but so as long as you get a C or above it'll transfer. They do have cool online options, highly recommend those too.",

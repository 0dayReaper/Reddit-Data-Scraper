    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI'm a PhD student at Mines and I'm currently commuting between Denver and Golden. The commute by bus is longer than I expected (it's 1 hour some days and even 2 hours depending on the snow and how many stops are requested). It's getting rough because I have classes late at night this semester. I'm thinking of moving closer to campus, but I can't do that before next semester because of a lease.\n\nMy question is: are there any ride sharing groups that commute between Denver or Golden? Or someone who can reliably commute with me? I can pay for gas/we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",

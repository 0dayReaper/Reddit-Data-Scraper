I remember an end of semester paper on a topic of your choosing. Class included meditating, learning about other world views, etc. Might not be everyone's jam but I thought it was interesting. Class can get intense b/c some folks share some deeply personal events",

You only to write like 1 full essay about a film, make a 30 second silent film, and of course give a presentation since its a 400 level course. Take it with Dr. Shannon Mancus. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say it actually changed the way I watch movies and TV shows.\n\nEdit: Someone mentioned it\u2019s hard to get into. You can account for that by just taking it your senior year when you have top registration priority. She was also very down to add people to the class if they just showed up first day and were on waitlist.",

I know everyone says it\u2019s super hard to get into, but\u2026I\u2019m a sophomore (junior by credits) and I got into it, so like it\u2019s not unreasonable. If you\u2019re a junior/senior according to registration time, I\u2019d say you\u2019ve probably got a good chance. I was originally waitlisted, but at the beginning of the semester she absorbed the waitlists so everyone got in.\n\nI love Mancus!! She\u2019s very easy going with work (although there is still enough to do) but she\u2019s forgiving with things like deadlines. She\u2019s pushed back things several times when the class has been busy. Also, her syllabus states that if she\u2019s ever late on grading things/feedback, she\u2019s obligated to bring us chocolate, which is so kind, especially when other professors (especially HASS) can wait until the end of the semester for any feedback at all. There\u2019s really a feeling that she cares about your well-being and that\u2019s so nice at Mines. \n\nThe class itself is very interesting and not too much work. Usually its about 1-2 movies a week and 2-4 readings. There\u2019s a variety of modern and old movies, you cover about a genre a week and start with early film all the way to contemporary stuff. \n\nAlso, if you end up getting into it and need the assigned textbook for next semester, hmu!",

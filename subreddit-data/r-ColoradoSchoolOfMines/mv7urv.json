    "postText": "Hey y'all. High school senior + local here.\n\nFirst off, I'm happy to say that this fall I'll be an Oredigger. I plan on majoring in CS. \n\nThroughout these past few years I've accumulated concurrent enrollment credit over at CCD. Part of this credit translates into the Mines CS sequence up to 262. \n\nWith that, I'm debating whether or not it would be a good idea that I re-take 261 at Mines and deny my transfer credit. The reason for this is because I've followed the CS sequence thus far in Java, whereas Mines teaches 261 and 262 in C++. \n\nWhile this may not be as big of an issue in regards to 101, which is taught in Python but only seems to touch base on the fundamentals of programming (which I am comfortable with as is), I don't know whether or not this would put me at a disadvantage in 262 specifically, as I've read here that 262 seems to be a rough class to grasp.\n\nThat being said, I feel that I could instead just as easily save time and money by studying up on C++ this summer. I've done it before with the web trifecta and Java rather easily prior to taking any CS class, so I might just pull it off if I gave it an effort.\n\nWhat would you all say about my situation as Mines students? Could I pull it off picking up C++ over summer to prep myself or is it better to deny the credit and take 261 at Mines?",

If you feel like you can self study up that material over a summer (which I'm sure you could if you can hold yourself accountable) then I'd say skip the class. Keep in mind I haven't taken 262, just observing that 261 really is the kind of course that could be covered in a 4-6 hour youtube c++ tutorial if you do it right and know how you learn.",

Really though you don't need too much prior coding knowledge beyond conditionals, loops and functions in c++. If you are fluent with those in java then it prob wouldn't be hard to learn how to translate to c++ syntax bc the logic is all the same. I personally took 261 with the prior experience in python and it was (kinda) easy.",

However, I also took data structures in high school, so 262 here was just a review for me and allowed me to focus more on the syntax of c++.\n\nAlso, somewhat related - not sure if you have transfer credit for 101 but I would try and get out of it if you can, especially since you have prior experience programming. The challenge exam (from my experience at least) wasn't awful, but it had a lot of vocab thats available on quizlet to study.  It'll free up a few credits, but up to you!",

I was in your shoes with only Java coming in freshman year. 262 almost made me want to quit CS the first few weeks in my first semester, but I doubled down and learned the syntax on the fly. Ended with a high A and still one of my favorite classes.\n\nAs long as you have solid programming concepts and skills down, you'll be fine. It'll be a bit rough to understand the syntax in the beginning but soon after you get a momentum. Best of luck on your decision.",

If you're comfortable with Java and have the time to self-study C++, I'd do that and take the transfer credit. From seeing my classmates struggle in 261, a lot of the projects are a mixture of learning concepts with a lot of busywork. I'd advise skipping 261 if you can and feel comfortable enough to do so.",

I'm in 261 right now and it'll probably be really slow for you, since it's catered towards people who have never programmed before. I took 101 last semester, and transferring my knowledge of Python over to C++ has been easy once I learned the syntax. IMO the class only gets a little difficult about mid semester with sets 5 &amp; 6, the rest is pretty easy and I rarely worry about 261. If you brush up on C++ over the summer, you'll definitely be fine.",

Your passion for it will help overcome any unexpected challenges. \n\nHave a look at other comments and the coursework, I've never taken it and can't speak to it specifically. I will confirm school is hard.",

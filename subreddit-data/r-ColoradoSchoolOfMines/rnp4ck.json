    "postText": "I am a 3rd year mechanical engineer at UCSB and I am taking some time off school and considering transferring.\n\nI would start August 2022 and also pursue a minor in business. My brother just started at Mines and loves it, and that\u2019s how I learned about your school. I toured once with him and it seemed incredible (but I am aware that the food is not so good).\n\nDoes anyone have any advice or input? What\u2019s life like outside of the classroom? What do you love or hate about Mines? Do you think you\u2019ll go back to ZoomU like the UCs did??",

            "comment": "Something that every MechE transfer prospect should know is that Mines has a sequence of seven design classes that \"have to\" be taken one at a time, in order. \"Have to\" is in quotation marks because you can get an exception to take a few at a time, but the end result is similar: you will spend *several* more semesters here than other places to catch up on the design sequence, in addition to the normal ME courses and any from UCSB that may not matriculate. If you're serious about transferring here, make sure you talk to admissions about this.",

Haven\u2019t discussed it explicitly with admissions but I did look heavily at the flow chart and how those 7 (or what I presume to be those 7) are linked.\n\nTheoretically one could take 200 and 300 at the same time, then 201 and 301 the following semester. I assume you\u2019re a ME, is this advisable?\n\nCredit wise I\u2019ll technically only have 3 semesters left if I transfer but expect it to extend to 4 given that some things won\u2019t transfer. Might that be expected or should I figure 5?",

You'll have to take NHV, you'll probably have to take EDNS 151, you'll have to take HASS 200, you might have to take econ too (you only get off the hook for econ if you've taken both macro and micro). Then you have the normal junior/senior core classes, and the design classes. \n\nNow, if you combine 200 and 300, then 301 and 201, you have two semesters right there. You'll then have to do Senior Design 1, and Senior Design 2, which obviously can't be taken at the same time. So 4 semesters to get the last 6 design classes, but I think you'll need at least one more semester to accommodate those other classes I mentioned. More realistically 2 more semesters. So that puts us at 5-6 more semesters overall.",

I can't speak much to the difference in academics, but Mines is definitely rigorous and requires a big time commitment to stay on top of work.",

But my request keeps getting rejected/ignored.\n\nI'm a neat and clean tenant who's just looking for a Townhouse accommodation near mines for under 1000$ rent. If any of you good peeps still looking for roommates, please let me know. Or atleast guide me what other places I can look for accommodation.\n\nPS: I'm an international student",

Other sites you may want to try include apartments.com or Facebook Marketplace.",

    "postText": "I've recently seen more and more posts showcasing the negative sentiments felt at Mines and I just wanted to give a post to really drive home the point that this is a \\*relatively\\* small blip in your life. While college can be a place to thrive, meet people, make connections, etc, it is not always the case. Some people will graduate with no friends, and some will not graduate at all. BUT THIS IS OKAY. There is not one path in life. Life is a marathon, and it's easy to get caught up in your own head thinking about the short term. Everyone makes mistakes, and sometimes it takes failure to become the person you want to envision yourself at. I know in the moment you feel alone. But regardless of whether your experience at this university is positive or negative, everyone is going to have periods in their life going through this. Some people are going to go through Mines and have a pretty positive experience (which I commend you for if that's the case), but if you don't that's okay too. You'll push through stronger and you'll know you can survive at rock bottom. You'll thrive in the future. \n\nFor anyone who's felt like this before I encourage you to post in the comments and support each other. We are a community and we need to be there for each other.",

It's just going to make you feel worse. It showcases only the highlights of people's lives and if you're feeling low that likely won't help.\n\n2. Take time to do productive hobbies that envigorate you. If you have one already, Do It! If you don't, take the time to try new things.\n\n3. Schedule, Schedule, Schedule. Planners can be your friend when you are struggling. It keeps you moving and keeps you focused.\n\n4. Find someone to talk to. A friend, a family member, a counselor. Anyone. Letting yourself get in your head can eat at you and make you feel even more isolated and alone.",

It was hard, it wasn\u2019t always rewarding or fulfilling, and we all drank more than a human should be able to drink. \n\nWe hit our 10yr reunion this summer. Mines helped jumpstart our careers and brought us together but wading through the shit stunk. But I\u2019d probably do it all again if I had the choice because work has been a breeze since Mines, I can think very critically and operationally, and those skills were definitely developed in Golden. I don\u2019t even do ChemE anymore but Mines\u2019 rigor helps my current career. \n\nBut fuck Calc2 and (non-summer) Ochem though.",

            "comment": "Dad here. This is great advice. My son had sort of a mixed experience last year and I know there were times when he really started to doubt himself. My message to him is to approach academic challenges like you would approach an engineering challenge: prepare and plan the best you can, try to implement your plan, and if that doesn\u2019t work then try something else. I want him to know he has the freedom to fail, and that I\u2019ll help him get back up again. I love that kid and I know he\u2019ll be fine, with or without Mines. \n\nThat goes for the rest of you too.",

The few friends I made lost touch cuz they got busy and life happens. I\u2019m on my final year at mines then I start grad school here right away so I hope I can branch out and make friends. It\u2019s been a lonely few years not having a friend to talk to or hang out. Getting off of social media has definitely helped and I feel much happier these days. Thank you again for posting this, it really helped.",

I personally did not allow the stigma of failure to bother me, even though I encountered it many times. Make what you can at the school and you'll be pretty happy.",

There were stressful times, but those are always short lived compared to positive memories. And I have never found this school to be as hard as some people say.\n\nI think it could be because i struggled in high school, but have excelled much more at college. Many mines students are the opposite.\n\nEdit: I also did community college first, which is a pretty boring college experience compared to mines.",

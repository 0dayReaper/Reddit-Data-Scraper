    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI have been admitted to School of Mines as well as Rose Hulman Institute of Technology for mechanical engineering. What I really love about Rose Hulman is that the class sizes are small (ca. 30 max for freshman year) and that the curriculum includes many projects.\n\nHowever, I got into the Grandey honors program at Mines which would provide a smaller class size for 1 course only (to my knowledge at least) in my freshman year. I know that Rose Hulman is a lot smaller than Mines, which I think is great, but Mines' location is hard to beat compared to basically in the middle of nowhere in Indiana.\n\nHere are my questions:\n\nHow small and how lecture based are classes in your freshman year at mines? \n\nAre there many projects in the curriculum? \n\nAre there any innovation centers/ workshops/ makerspaces in which clubs such as Formula SAE or robotics clubs etc. are housed?\n\nHow well know is Mines in the industry? I am looking to get a mechE job in the space sector, preferably near the coasts (east or west).\n\nHas anyone heard of the space mining minor at mines? I read about it online in an article but have not found much information on it on the website.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to dm me or leave your response in the comments. Thanks a lot in advance!",

            "comment": "Current Junior in Mech E at Mines here minoring in aerospace.\n\nFreshman year classes are very unrepresentative of what classes will be like in your sophomore year and beyond, and in my opinion your decision shouldn\u2019t be based on freshman year classes. But to answer your question, they are usually pretty large (100+ students) and very lecture based. Physics has a studio portion where you\u2019ll work on assignments with other students. Chemistry has labs. Upper level classes are much much smaller and some are lecture based while others are project based.\n\nThe mechanical engineering department has project based classes you\u2019ll take every semester sophomore year and beyond. There is also a basic design class you\u2019ll take freshman year where you\u2019ll do one big project.\n\nThere are an incredible amount of workshops and makerspaces around campus for you to do any project you want. There are also a ton of clubs. Join ones relating to your career and ones that interest you!\n\nMines is very well known within Colorado but not on the coasts. That being said, you should have no problem getting a job in the space sector in Colorado or the coasts. Colorado and especially Denver is the second biggest state in the aerospace industry, not sure if you\u2019re aware of that.\n\nThere\u2019s no space mining minor that I\u2019m aware of. There is an aerospace minor and space resources master\u2019s program.",

I feel as if this would greatly reduce their credibility among research fields that have a high number of PhD applicants, but I digress. \n\nJust pick a school and get a degree.

We never visited RHIT, but I liked how the campus was organized around the lake. And definitely smaller and most likely a more intimate feel. But it is hard to pass up Golden, and relative to other schools, Mines is far from being \"big\".\n\nOP - Iwould visit both and ask yourself which ones feels more like \"home\" to you. I believe your decision will be obvious.",

    "postText": "hi y\u2019all, I\u2019m currently a high school senior who\u2019s 99% certain I will be attending mines in the fall. If someone could give me advice on which dorm hall I should pick I would appreciate the help.\n\nI\u2019m a fairly sociable person but I like to have some quiet time every once in a while. Since i\u2019m from out of state I definitely need somewhere where I can get to know people.\n\nI also would prefer somewhere with good access to a nice outdoor area where I can chill outside when its nice out.\n\ni\u2019m not sure if i am going to visit anytime soon because of covid so any advice is appreciated!",

Weaver is a bit outdated, and you can get to know people in your suite pretty well, but you don\u2019t see people outside of it much. Maple seems similar to elm, maybe a bit nicer because of the private bathrooms. And I know nothing about spruce, but have heard it\u2019s nice when it isn\u2019t under construction. As for outside space, everything is a super quick walk but Maple has a nice little courtyard with a few benches and tables and the trads have a pretty big courtyard where everyone can hang out. Most people I know walk over and hang out at Kaffadar commons though if they want to be outside. Elm doesn\u2019t really have an outdoor space right by it and I\u2019m not sure about spruce. Weaver has a few benches and a little lawn. Hopefully that all helps a bit.",

It isn't as social as the trads, but it still can be fairly social. The rooms are bigger here than any other dorm I'm fairly certain and the walls have decent noise proofing, so there is stir potential for privacy.",

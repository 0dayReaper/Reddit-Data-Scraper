I don't know if you went to career fair, but fwiw, a lot of the companies there either didn't care about GPA, or had a special Mines GPA threshold of around 2.9ish. This is not a grade inflation school by any measure lol. \n\nCongrats on the GPA bump btw! I know it's \"just\" from swimming, but take it anyway you can get it, my friend!",

It might not always be the MOST important thing but if you are competing with someone who has a significantly higher GPA it is definitely a factor that comes into play. I\u2019m not sure why everyone says employers don\u2019t care. If yours is a bit on the low end, this shouldn\u2019t discourage you, it should drive you and push you to really get it up. It definitely isn\u2019t the end all be all, but I think a lot of people make themselves feel better by saying \u201cGPA doesn\u2019t matter much\u201d and that just isn\u2019t true. For a first job, that\u2019s all they have to go off of besides your personality. To land the interview in the first place it can be a big help.",

So I would like to remind people (especially upperclassers) with low GPAs that they *do* still have prospects, and they *can* get their start regardless of that number. You may not get *the* job right out of college with a low GPA, but you can absolutely get *a* job.",

As a non-trad transfer student, I can say without hesitation that prioritization is a skill that is undervalued but absolutely necessary in the real world. You can either obsess over a 4.0 at Mines and (probably) burn yourself out or decide where you want to focus your efforts and accept somewhere between a 3.0 and 4.0. I chose the latter and it looks like I will be graduating with slightly higher than a 3.5\u2026.I\u2019m not at all worried that this will prevent me from getting a job.",

I went to graduate school after graduating from Mines and then got a job at a national laboratory in California. \n\nOh geez, where do I start...\n\nOne thing that I tell students is to get to know your professors. They are all devoted to wanting their students to succeed in their classes. Furthermore, you can get a kickass letter of recommendation from them and also access to lots of connections they have to industry and research institutes. \n\nAlso, I highly advocate for people to check out cool projects and research opportunities. I sometimes felt like I retained and  understood theoretical concepts better through application rather than just doing practice homework problems.",

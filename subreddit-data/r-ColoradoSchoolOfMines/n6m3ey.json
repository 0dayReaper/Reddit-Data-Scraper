I understand we should connect with the professor/researcher beforehand, but is it expected that you come to an agreement that they want you to come on board? Some of the questions seem like things you would discuss after being selected for a project. \n\nWhat about applying for multiple projects? Any advice would be wonderful!",

            "comment": "While I had an overall good time with MURF during my undergrad, there are some annoying things about the program. 2 years ago, I applied to multiple projects and had really good conversations with both professors who basically said I was going to be their pick. One of the projects I was really excited about, the other was a backup. I ended up getting the backup project assigned to me by the MURF people basically because that\u2019s what they randomly decided even though I was more qualified for the other project. I wish they would have given me my choice. \n\nIn addition, the $1500 they pay you is way too low in my opinion. They say that it equates to 4-5 hours a week at 12$ an hour, but it\u2019s going to be real tough to do significant amounts of research in that little time per week. Not to mention that even 12$ an hour is pretty ridiculous for how high quality and difficulty of work some MURF students do.\n\nA lot of professors require their students to join in on group and personal research meetings which for me, were up to 2-3 hours per week. If I were to follow the recommended 4-5 hours, I\u2019d never have accomplished anything. I was really motivated for the work and ended up working between 10-15 hours a week on it but my professor didn\u2019t have the funds to pay me extra. \n\n3 years ago, MURF still paid hourly and that was a much better system in my opinion. It incentivized hard work. All this isn\u2019t even including the lengthy time requirements that MURF requires at the end of the year for their symposium thing. They make you do a presentation as well as do some training thing. \n\nMy advice would be to set clear expectations with your professor for time commitments and ask if they could pay you from other sources on top of the MURF money. Otherwise, you\u2019re going to either barely do any real research , or work a ton for very little pay. \n\nIf you have other questions, feel free to pm me.",

I\u2019m pretty sure as long as the prof is on board and you can give a general answer you should be okay. Good luck!",

            "comment": "Yes, in my experience you want to meet with the professor and work out the project before you apply for the MURF. MURF definitely seems to present itself in a weird way like that. I would think of it more as \"I want to work on this project and am applying for funding\" than a \"I want this fellowship and am applying for a project\".   \n\n\nLike, if you and a professor work out that they want you on the project then the application becomes mostly a formality as long as you don't put anything too stupid down, or unless the prof is trying to sponsor multiple students for the MURF. But if the prof says \"I want this student to work on this project\" the MURF peeps will usually say \"okay, I guess we can give them money then\". At least that's the vibe I've gotten; I don't actually know how the decision making process works so I could be wrong. \n\nI've never applied for multiple projects but would probably not recommend doing so. I don't think they'll let you work on multiple projects, so I would find someone you want to work with and then apply with them.   \n\n\nAs others have said, they pay is a little lackluster based on how much work I think it ends up being but honestly you're doing it more for the experience/resume than the money (or at least I was). And to be fair MURF's expectations and requirements are also fairly low so I guess that balances things out.",

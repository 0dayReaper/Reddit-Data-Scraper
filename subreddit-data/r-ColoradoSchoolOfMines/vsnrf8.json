    "postText": "Anyone who is currently in either program would be great to hear from.\n\nI\u2019m a geophysics undergrad at UMD right now and eyeing CSM for grad school. I have a cumulative 3.44 GPA and a 3.83 in all major related classes. How does this fair to the competition?\n\nThe main point of my post is this. Though I am a geophysics student, I\u2019ve been considering applying to engineering programs due to an interest in it. The geophysical engineering program requirements looks like it would be a great opportunity for me to blend the two specialties in one program. Anyone have any words of warning, suggestions or info on the program?\n\nMy second point is that what I hope to do with my career is to essentially develop and utilize technology to build infrastructure and obtain resources on the moon and mars to sustain a human community, regardless of its size\u2026 so in other words exactly what the Space Resources program is for. Anyone in this program and have advice? I\u2019m hesitant to consider it because I\u2019d hate to pigeon hole myself into something so specific.",

He has a deep seated interest in both topics and is a great mentor. I was able to get funding through the geophysics department that will also apply to my space resources masters so you should definitely consider that as well! \n\nI have very similar interests to your own, so if you ever have questions feel free to ask!",

I know a degree in mining is considered STEM but I already am making things difficult for me by choosing to get into geology. So a degree in mining would probably stretch my already small chances of getting accepted even thinner.\n\nIm sure a degree in space resources would have a similar effect, I just thought it looked really interesting so it\u2019s worth inquiring about.",

Space resources is mostly done through Mech-E I believe\u2026\u2026. And I would say space resources wouldn\u2019t be my top recommendation because of the tight budgeting constraints they are under as well as how new the program is.  Now you could very well do something with Space Geology as I know many professors in Geology focus on that.  If you want to do Astronaut program, look and see what earth science fields are heavily lacking in their program and that might make you an even better candidate! Best of luck!",

It was removed after the department head left for a private firm. It looks like he's back in academia at the University of Arizona in their Lunar and Planetary Laboratory department. He is hands down the smartest person I've ever met. I took several of his classes and he just works on a different level than the rest of the world. I don't know much about the University of Arizona but any degree under him would be a degree worth having.",

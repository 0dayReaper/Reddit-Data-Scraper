    "postText": " Just finished my first year at Mines with a 4.0 cumulative GPA - from what I understand this is fairly rare. Is there a way I can use this to apply for an increase in my \u201cpresident\u2019s scholarship\u201d, or any others that Mines offers? I\u2019ve also done a lot of volunteer work for the school if that would help my case. \n\n  I\u2019m not expecting anything per se, but thought it worth reaching out. I also hope this doesn\u2019t sound conceited or anything. Thank you!",

            "comment": "I was in the same boat, asked many times for a scholarship increase from financial aid. The response was consistently no because (in their words) there wasn\u2019t enough foundation money to increase the scholarship but I would be placed on a priority list for scholarship increase if \u201cfunds become available\u201d from the foundation. I was also told that as long as my GPA stays above a 3.5, I\u2019ll be in the running for an increase. A year later and nothing has happened, I\u2019ve kinda given up. A 4.0 year is an incredible achievement and I wish there were funds to incentive that kind of academic performance but I don\u2019t make the rules. \n\nReach out to your academic advisor, it can\u2019t hurt. Best of luck and congrats!",

If theres limited funds I would have liked to see that go to the people in most need financially rather than just getting good grades. Not saying you don\u2019t have to have a job or aren\u2019t struggling financially, but limited funds should not just go to  those doing the best in school.",

These were a mixture of need and merrit, but I never had to apply for them. Just kept a good GPA and found them in my trailehead. Best of luck regardless",

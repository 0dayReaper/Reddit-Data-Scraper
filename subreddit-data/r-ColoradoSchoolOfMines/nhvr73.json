            "comment": "The shared/environmental courses I took as a civil (fluid mech, hydrology, fundamentals of env eng, soil mech, groundwater) were all excellent, and in general the water-focused faculty here are great.  The environmental engineering students I know both have jobs lined up after graduation, I believe.  Can't comment on Boulder's program.\n\nAlso relevant would be large school vs smaller school, party school vs not, and Boulder vs Golden.  If you can visit both and get a feel for campus it would be a good idea to do so.\n\nI'll also second the \"pick the lower cost one\" advice.  I doubt any difference would justify (say) tens of thousands of dollars' difference in price, with the possible exception of a few niche specialties (like mining engineering).\n\n---\n\nEdit: forgot a major strong point.  If your interest in environmental engineering is related to water, we have a lot of hydrology research (including water quality stuff), which undergrads frequently contribute to.  I worked as a research technician in ReNUWIt for the last two years of my undergrad at Mines, and I got to do a ton of in-depth technical stuff in a great work environment.",

The boulder folks definitely seem more toxic and angry, which surprised me. Anyways what I love about mines is the small class sizes, I\u2019ve met with the president a few times and my department head multiple times, they\u2019re super nice and sociable. At boulder you could *never* do that. My sister went to boulder and often struggled due to the large class sizes. Although classes can be tough it really helps you become more resilient. Mines definitely has a social scene and the stereotype is really overblown. The class difficulty often drives people to work together and become friends. I would definitely recommend mines, but it\u2019s not for everyone. Either way I wish you luck in your decision and if you have any questions feel free to dm me.",

            "comment": "I was civil and my wife was environmental at mines. Mines is unique since it has environmental as a standalone major. If you want to go into research or water treatment mines is really good for that. I think mines falls short in its water resources education which is by far the most prominent career path for environmental engineers. They didn\u2019t have hydraulics when I was there and hydrology was taught on a high level with no emphasis on design. I think CU offers a more well rounded education and variety in civil engineering, but you have to deal with larger class sizes and it is less specialized. I think both can be a decent option. Also worth noting that cu is much more affordable.",

Seems similar to Boulder's Hydraulic Engineering class (which, though it's required for their civil major, isn't required for their environmental major).\n\nBoulder's EnvE major doesn't seem to require any more water resources coursework than Mines' (just fluid mech and hydrology for both), and Mines requires one more technical elective than Boulder does (which could be put towards water resources).",

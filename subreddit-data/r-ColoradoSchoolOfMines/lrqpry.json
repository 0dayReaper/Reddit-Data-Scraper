    "postText": "Hello all, I am a senior in high school currently working on the E-Days Scholarship at Mines. Could someone potentially explain to me what the Senior Design Project? The essay prompt mentions that you are \"working hard on your Senior Design Project at Mines,\" but to my understanding it is simply a project for certain majors. Any help is extremely appreciated.\n\nEdit: If anyone is interested in giving me some more insight on the Mines experience, that would also be appreciated. The prompt also mentions \"how your experiences at Mines have influenced your decisions.\"",

A few teams also do contests, like the concrete canoe (yes, you can make a working canoe out of concrete).\n\nFor example, my senior design team--which is four civil engineering majors, two environmental engineering majors, and a mechanical engineering major--is designing a fish migration barrier for the US Forest Service.  We're doing the whole design; we started by going out to the site to collect topographic and hydrologic data, and we'll finish up by submitting a set of engineering drawings and a design report.  Along the way we're doing all of the stream modeling, structural analysis, etc.",

It usually takes a full semester of more, involves project planning, time line, working with outside organization and having some kind of \u201csupervisor\u201d that you report updates to. At the end of the semester you write a project report and give a presentation. \n\nWhen I was an underground in MME (materials) I did mine on spot welding of zinc coated steels. A car company was trying to develop spot welding procedures for galvanized sheet steel. So we did a ton of spot welding at different parameters and did microstructure and failure analysis after tensile testing. \n\nA project that is currently going on in MME is: students are working to get a welding robot arm up and running and creating optimized weld beads. So this involves fine tuning the arms movements and the weld parameters and potentially using some coding software.",

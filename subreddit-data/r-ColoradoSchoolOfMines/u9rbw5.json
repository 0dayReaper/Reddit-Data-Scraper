I\u2019m planning to pick single dorm but I was wondering which residence Hall will fit me the best. I\u2019m not much of a social person so I would more prefer having less of a huge sharing with bathrooms. I\u2019m well aware that I\u2019ll have to start becoming more social as the years goes on, but as for my first year I want to pick something that\u2019ll make me feel less nervous. Can anyone help me out? Thank you guys so much:))",

            "comment": "Maple would probably be your best bet. The bathrooms are suite style, so sharing it with 3-4 people. If you get a single in Maple, you'll only share a bathroom with one other person. If you're not in a TLC, maple with be pretty quiet as well.\nJust be careful not to stay too much in your comfort zone and isolate yourself.",

Elm and Spruce are traditional style dorms with a few single rooms - Spruce is overall a nicer building but Elm has less people. Hope this helps",

I\u2019m fine with sharing bathrooms with two people, but I\u2019m probably not as comfortable when it\u2019s more than 3. Like how will the restrooms be if I were to pick single dorm in either of those two places?",

Last year for some reason I couldn't login to choose my housing for the first couple days after it opened and I ended up in the trads. \n\nOn the upside I am in a room for two people alone. So it's big and I have two of everything the room is furnished with. Sitting on my second bed that I treat as a couch right now. Down side its hot sometimes tho cause no AC and of course shared bathroom with the whole floor.\n\nI was in the same position as you, wanting to find a dorm where I don't have to be social. I assure you, if you want to be, you can be antisocial wherever you end up. The year is almost over and I don't even know the names of half the people on my floor lmao.",

            "comment": "I graduated with my bs in 2017 and MS in 2018, information systems concentration. I could have gone on to do a PhD at mines or elsewhere in the same concentration but I decided to go into industry instead. I thought it was a decent program. Strong in digital circuits, embedded systems, and power but weak in RF and analog circuits.  I had really really really terrible teachers for my advanced E&amp;M and analog circuits classes so i never felt like i understood those concepts enough to become an RF engineer or an analog person. But, as i said, other parts were good. And i found myself decently well prepared for a career as an embedded software engineer. I also don't feel inferior talking to my peers who went to big, nationally recognized schools or anything. I hope that in the last few years things have changed for the better in the EE department. The bad teachers I had have all retired or left, but some of the good ones did too so who knows.",

I started working for Procter &amp; Gamble with a $90k + salary ($87k with just a B.S. for comparison). They overhauled the department relatively recently (~ 40% of the department left and was replaced) for older, tenured professors to retire. They beefed up the Integrated Circuits &amp; Electronics area with the professor movement (I got my specialty in ICE too) during that overhaul. \n\nWith ICE, I had colleagues regularly go to AMD and start at the same $90k + with just a B.S. \n\nIt depends on your interest and specialty area I'd say! National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is right up the street (10 mins away), so if you are interested in Power or Renewable Energy Mines has a unique advantage. It's definitely a good program in my opinion - one of the 3 hardest on campus. Great people and good opportunities in industry after for sure! \n\nWasn't interested in research, but know that Master's and PhD programs typically want high (3.75 - 4.0) GPAs and due to the difficulty of EE at Mines, it may not be the best conduit (hehe \u26a1) for pursuing research unless you're heavily dedicated \ud83d\ude04",

Mines' strength is more towards power systems and electronics in my honest opinion. If you are more interesting in analog circuits, computer engineering-related disciplines, and semiconductors, then I recommend Berkeley.\n\nThe difficulty at Mines is mostly due to the amount of busy work we get. Berkeley is also difficult, but it is because of its focus on theory.",

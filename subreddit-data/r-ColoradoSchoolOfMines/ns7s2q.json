    "postText": "I actively feel like I'm losing it. The rigor and pacing of this class is making me lose hold of my sanity and I'm barely halfway through. I don't understand why field session is set up the way that it is. I don't know a single person getting a full night of sleep, yet we're expected to operate machinery that we've never seen before with minimal supervision (heard a rumor that students are sent to the ER every year for steam burns). When I do sleep, it's restless and filled with nightmares about labs and orals. It's also common to hear students complaining that they haven't had time to eat. The TAs and professors actively talk shit ABOUT students TO students. I've never felt so broken down and stupid. I've maintained a 3.9 GPA my entire time at Mines, so I know I'm smart and I know I can do the work, but field session is making me second guess everything about myself. I'm not producing quality work AT ALL with the state of stress/sleep deprivation I'm in and I am embarrassed that I'm being graded on shitty reports that I know I could do better on if I had a grip on my mental health.\n\nI know I'm bitching, and I know I need to just suck it up and do it (and I will!), I just needed to get this off my chest. Anyone else feeling like this?",

Make students pay to do free work for you. Okay. Cool. Field session should be exempt from tuition fees.",

Our teams would have \u201cshifts\u201d for eating/sleeping as needed which helped. Breaking and blocking the work can also help. \n\nThe good news is that the grading seemed to be pretty lenient after the curve and teammate ratings. I got an A/A and none of my actual reports were As individually. Also, after this tour cohort will feel way more close/friendly hopefully. And the crunch will make your IRL jobs seem easy in comparison. \n\nThe Profs talking shit to students is a red flag to me.

I almost got fired for proposing changes that would automate and mitigate all of the above except the dumpster fire--can't fix stupid.

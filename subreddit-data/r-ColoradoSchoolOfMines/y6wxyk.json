    "postText": "I am a graduate student in math, and I intend to graduate in May 2023. That means time is running out. I go to the Colorado School of Mines gosh dang it! I haven't even seen one lousy stick of dynamite.  Mining engineers - do they have a course where you get to make stuff go kaboom? Are there prereqs? Clubs? Events? Professors with explosives and too much free time? What do I have to do to make kablooey next semester? I can't go out into the world, say I went to CSM, and then explain to them that I've never even seen C4. C'mon!",

They wouldn't blow things up themselves but they would go to a mine and observe the placement and detonation as done by the professionals who work at the mine. Or so I heard. I'd ask some mining engineers that you know.",

    "postText": "One of my close friends and I had a discussion today about how we feel a bit lonely at Mines, and that covid has only made things worse (seems like a semi-common theme on this subreddit). We're both such Type A, introverted, artistic and hyper-focused and goal-oriented individuals and at times it can feel like there's literally nobody that can relate. Even aside from socially, it feels like there's so few people who work the same way we do that we can work on assignments and study with that isn't the day it's due /: \n\nSo, for the sake of me and this friend of mine, does anybody like crocheting or knitting? bullet journaling? want study buddies that like to complete things a day or more in advance? like having deep conversations and despise small talk?\n\nPlease reach out (\\_:",

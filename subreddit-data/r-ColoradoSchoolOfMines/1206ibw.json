    "postText": "Looking for recommendations for a laptop for a new student in the civil engineering program this fall.  We see the specifications, but curious if a surface pro that meets specs will be capable of running the software, or even installing the software that will be needed for a freshman?  Any recommendations for a good system to be looking at?",

            "comment": "For the most part, the only software freshmen use is solidworks in design 1. I had an i7 and it worked well for me. Anything with an i7 should work well.\nI am in my final year of Civil Engineering and I have had the same computer with an i7 processor the entire time, never had any issues.\n\nIn my experience, most of my classmates use the surface pro for notes and have a separate laptop to run software. I have a convertible laptop (HP Spectre) and use both software and take notes on it.",

All the software you need is provided by the school including the Microsoft office suite.  If you want to take notes electronically I would look into a dedicated device like a remarkable.",

Since I already had my email address, she got the \"nonstandard\" version, I think it included her middle initial?\n\nAnyhoo. At the start of each semester, I'd get one or two students emailing me with syllabus questions, and at the end of each semester I'd get one or two emails begging for extra credit opportunities. It took a lot of restraint to *not* fuck with the second group of people, but I always just gave them the email address they were looking for.",

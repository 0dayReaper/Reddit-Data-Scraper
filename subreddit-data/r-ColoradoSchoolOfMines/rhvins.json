    "postText": "Hi all! I am a sophomore in high school and while researching possible colleges to go to I stumbled across Mines. Unless something changes I would like to go for a degree in mechanical engineering. Given that I am an out of state student I know tuition would be quite high, do you think it is worth the money? Also if I were to stay in Colorado after being done with my degree would it be easy to find either an apprenticeship or full time job in mechanical engineering?",

You can establish residency which will save you quite a bit of money, but your family won\u2019t be able to help you out at all. You\u2019d need to essentially pay your own way, no co-signers on loans, etc. I even had to get my own phone plan (this was in 2010 so things may have changed). I had my student loan debt paid back within 7 years of graduating and I had 100% loans for tuition, no scholarships or grants. \n\nAs for finding a job in Colorado, I tried for two years after graduating with my masters (2013) and ended up moving to another state. About half of my friends stayed in Colorado and the other half have scattered all over the country. So if you want to stay in Colorado, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s possible. \n\nI\u2019ve been out of school for awhile, so things may have changed drastically in that time.",

I think in-state is usually like 3rd and out of state is 7th or something.\n\n You will absolutely find a job after graduation. You need to consider other things, though. Will the culture be too much for you? Do you want to live in Golden? Will you be okay not having a typical college experience with tons of parties and whatnot?",

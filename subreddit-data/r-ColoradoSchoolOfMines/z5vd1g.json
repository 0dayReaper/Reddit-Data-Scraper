    "postText": "Can you double major in Metallurgy and Mechanical Engineering easily or would I have to take a 5th year for doing so?\n\nEdit: Thanks to Mikron for answering my question. I plan to just take a minor in metallurgy and a concentration in manufacturing and materials engineering. Thank you guys for all the responses :)",

I know one person who double majored in two very different fields and graduated w/in 4 years AND still kicked ass. She is an unbelievable, picture-perfect student. A normie student like me would certainly need five or six years to pass both majors with a decent grade.\n\nSeparately, why are you considering a double major? Having a tough time picking one major over the other?",

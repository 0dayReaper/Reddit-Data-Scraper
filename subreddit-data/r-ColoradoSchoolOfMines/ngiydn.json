    "postText": "Does anyone know anything about \"Atmosphere, Weather and Climate\" (GEOC 407)?\n\nIt says in the catalog that it's offered alternate years, but I don't see it in the course search over the last few years (searching across all departments, since I don't know what \"GEOC\" corresponds to).  It sounds like an interesting class for an elective, but that relies on it actually being offered at some point.",

You may be able to register as an undergrad, but this would probably require special permission and may not even count towards your degree, I'd try the registrar's website for more info.\n\nSome 500 level courses are also the same material as a 400 level (with an extra project), and taught in the same class. The department advisor would probably know if that applies in this situation, because then you can take the 400 instead",

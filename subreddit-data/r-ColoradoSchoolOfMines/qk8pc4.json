But at the end of the day, the fact of the matter is that it always varies and you shouldn't expect a concrete answer from the community. \n\nDon't expect to get yours on X date because somebody else who applied at the same time did. And don't give up if it doesn't come in when you'd expect based off what other people said!\n\nGood luck!",

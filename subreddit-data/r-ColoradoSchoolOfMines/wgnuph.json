SigEp is another chiller frat that, along with KapSig, is also really focused on the brotherhood aspect. That is one thing about all the frats at Mines is that they seem much more genuine than what you\u2019d expect of a \u201ctypical fraternity\u201d",

During rush week I'd say go talk to as many people at as many different events as possible and just see who you vibe with most. If you dont vibe with any its nbd, most people at Mines are not part of greek life and it definitely wont hurt your social life if you arent involved in it.",

There are good people in all of them, but those are the stereotypes that I\u2019ve gathered.",

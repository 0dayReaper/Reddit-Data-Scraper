But anyway, how have you guys been doing during this pandemic (mental health, any in person classes, how online classes are going, etc.)?",

The party/riot was predominantly undergrad and you\u2019d be doing yourself a disservice to let that one incident eliminate their research topics from your potential choices especially since a phd is 4+ years",

I definitely would not base my decision on one event if I also have to consider research, but in my situation, I would be doing my graduate research at NREL, so the decision between CU and Mines is really just a matter of the culture, student life, the people I want to meet, etc.",

In our department, the grad students are close and pre-covid would regularly go to GCB (local brewery) and form ski groups. \n\nI don't know if these other comments saying go to CU are from undergrads, but at least for grad school I like the close-knit feel of Mines more than at boulder. Of course, this is heavily department dependent as well. Good luck with whatever you end up choosing!",

It\u2019s nearly impossible to meet anyone in any of your classes, work on homework with anyone, talk about lecture content etc. There\u2019s more than one class with some pretty insane grading policies and the focus on group work instead of actually teaching anything in Calc/Phys gets old quick.\n\nThat being said - lots of my frustrations are Covid related and freshman class related. The professors mostly seem to be at least competent, and I know a few PhD students who are really enjoying their time at Mines. It\u2019s a generally great place to be if you want to work hard and can come in a year not entirely focused on a global pandemic.",

            "comment": "Hi! I\u2019m a current Materials Science phd student at mines! My take on the program is that it\u2019s first of all very different from the metallurgical program, which seems to be highly structured and as someone else has said is very prestigious. Materials science just requires 3 core courses and then you fill the rest with electives. This makes it hard to form a community and get to know your classmates (but gives you the opportunity to really study what you want!). I think if you\u2019re mostly interested in doing research and getting close with your research group, Mines is a good option. The research facilities themselves are hit and miss. For example, there are a few SEMs available to use on campus, but are booked solid two weeks in advance. I\u2019m lucky to have a great research group with an advisor who has invested a lot in our own equipment, but I know it\u2019s not the same in every group. My advice is if you know what you want to focus on to pick a school based on your ability to find a group researching that topic. Feel free to PM me if you have any specific questions. I\u2019ve got about a year left so I\u2019ve been in the program for a bit and know a lot about it.",

            "comment": "I can't really compare Mines with CU because I have no experience with CU. But as someone who did his BS and MS at a small school that is very similar to Mines (New Mexico Tech) and started his PhD at a large school (Drexel) before moving to Mines, I may be able to offer some perspective there.  \n\n\nI was absolutely miserable at Drexel. The place just felt like a degree factory, and while yeah it was more social in the sense that there were more parties, I still felt like I was just a number. Grad school is inherently more close nit than undergrad, especially in smaller departments, so outside of pandemics making friends within your department is generally easier. It is entirely possible none of this applies to CU; it is just my experience with small vs large schools. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPre-Covid, I made friends with my office mates and research group during my first week here, so finding small groups of people to be social with has not been a challenge at all. We'd regularly hit the breweries after work and had a get-together at someone's place at least monthly. If post-Covid weekly parties are more important to you, that would be a point in Boulder's favor.  \n\n\nSince I noticed in your comments you said all of your research will be at NREL, critical considerations such as research facility access, and the specific research projects aren't nearly as important for you. I'd take a close look at the course catalogs for both schools, and see which one either offers the courses or freedom that interests you most. Coursework is a significant source of added stress, and you might as well make sure it is as interesting as possible. Also take a look at how the courses are offered. 3hr evening block courses would be great for NREL work, but it can be extremely difficult to actually retain any information from those, and I would recommend a more traditional course schedule.   \n\n\nA plus side for mines is that the student body in general seems to take the pandemic pretty seriously with no large parties and few objections to masking. While it likely won't be a concern for you when you get here, mines is also small enough getting a weekly test is easy.   \n\n\nSorry for the wall of text, but I hope this helps",

I currently attend to a large school and yes I want the opportunity to meet good people and be social but once I establish a good social circle of 4-6 people that\u2019s all I need. I\u2019d choose spending quality time with my friends than going to big parties any day. \n\nI will look into the courses offered, that\u2019s a good idea. I know the required courses are the same for both schools but the offered classes we could choose from are probably different.",

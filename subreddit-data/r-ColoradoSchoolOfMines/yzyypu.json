    "postText": "I am a MechE student and about a week ago when I registered for my classes, two of them were completely full and there were no other schedules available. The two courses are  **MEGN** **381** **-** **MANUFACTURING PROCESSES**  and  **MEGN** **351** **-** **FLUID MECHANICS** . These are the two courses that I need to progress in my degree, so I really need to get in there somehow. I know I'm going to have to contact the professors but I don't know if there's anything specific I should mention in my email to raise my chances of getting their approval.",

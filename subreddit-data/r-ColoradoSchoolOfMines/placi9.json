I understand it's a STEM oriented school and that explains it, however, is the gap evident? Is it tough to find other girls and make friends? Considering how small Mines is, I'm worried it may be startling.",

There are not a ton of women in the CS program at mines, but the department head, Tracy Camp, and the new one (don't recall her name, it's been a couple years) had a lot of programs to really make sure that women felt included. I think the top of pretty much every class was always a woman.",

From my classes there are fewer girls (your stat seem accurate) but so far most guys or gal I have met are nice, helpful and fun to hang out and study with. There is SWE and clubs you can join, and I often hang out with girls outside of CS too. I totally understand your concern, but please don\u2019t let that stop you! PM me if you want to and I\u2019m happy to chat :)",

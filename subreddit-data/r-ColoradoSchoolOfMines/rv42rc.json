This would give students the opportunity to quarantine and get tested without exposing each other and without missing classes... Even if it's just for a couple of weeks.\n\nThoughts?\n\nEdit: For clarification, I wasn't suggesting students stay home... Rather have the flexibility of hybrid courses to determine if in person or online better fits their circumstances.\n\nEdit 2: I tested positive for covid today, so be safe out there kids. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc (Vaccinated and boostered \ud83e\udd37)",

And considering that &gt;80% of students are vaccinated, and that there\u2019s only been 183 cases since school started, I think it would be a bit overkill to go hybrid. Although maybe giving students a remote option if they aren\u2019t comfortable might be a good move.",

I believe the Marshall Fire played a bigger part as to why they are going remote than COVID.  With as much as students pay to go to Mines, they deserve to be able to go in person.",

If you get the flu or covid or strep throat or whatever, then you'll be out of school for a week anyway, and this is the time of year when those diseases spread the most. Might as well have hybrid class capacity so the sick kids can still keep up, and it's really not hard on the school to offer it. In any case, I just got tested today at the Mines testing lot, and the place was *packed*. I suspect, if they see a lot of positives return this week, they might be more likely to make a concession.",

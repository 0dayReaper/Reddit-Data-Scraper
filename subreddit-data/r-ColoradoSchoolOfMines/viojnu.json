    "postText": "So I just signed my lease to stay at Mines Park for the coming school year and I'm thinking about what to bring for move-in. The building I'm in is in the 1800s and it says bedrooms come furnished. What furnishings is that exactly? I can't find any info anywhere. Do any current/former residents have any info on that?\n\nI've got a decent desk with me and I was planning on bringing that with me but if there's already a desk there I might just sell the one I have now. Thoughts?",

Plus, lots of fees for other apartments rack up a lot of extra costs that I didn\u2019t want to worry about month to month. Basically, it was just more convenient and much faster and easier to get secured than a regular apartment in the area",

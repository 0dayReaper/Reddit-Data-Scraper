I am probably a little early, but do you guys have any tips about stuff to do, stuff to not do, housing, meals and what to expect at Golden? Thanks in advance!",

You can get burned very fast (well under an hour of direct exposure), and you need a lot of water to tolerate the altitude, especially early on and especially because Golden is very dry.  A lot of newcomers to Colorado get both of those wrong.",

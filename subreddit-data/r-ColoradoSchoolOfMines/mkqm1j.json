            "comment": "I did (when I transferred to Mines).  I did my freshman year elsewhere in Computer Science, then switched to Mines with a major in civil.\n\nI've enjoyed it overall.  It would have probably suited my interests better to major in geo (as of transferring I was undecided between geotech and hydro), but I've heard civil has better career opportunities in hydrology/water resources, and I'm going to do a master's in hydro anyway so that's moot now.\n\nThe department is, in my experience, fantastic.  I've never had a *bad* civil professor, only mediocre at worst, and most are good to excellent, even when I haven't been interested in their class (e.g. I despise structural engineering but Dr. Liu is great anyway).  I've also had good research opportunities in the department.  The social environment is good too; I've had no trouble making friends (even as a transfer), and the atmosphere is much more collaborative than competitive.  As far as I'm aware, it's one of the easier majors at Mines, but still plenty rigorous.\n\nAlso, surveying is just wonderful.\n\nIn short, I think it's great, if it interests you.  I'd suggest taking CEEN210 (intro civil infrastructure) early on for an overview of the field.  I'm happy to answer any follow-up questions.",

It\u2019ll really help when taking my decision in to consideration.\n\nWould you recommend taking CEEN 210 on top of cal 3, phys 2, statics, and e&amp;es? It would put me at 17 credit hours, or I can take ceen 210 spring semester and have my credit hours better dispersed but would have to be fully committing to civil.",

If you think that'd be a reasonable course load, it probably makes sense to find out early, but it's not worth a massive crunch if not.",

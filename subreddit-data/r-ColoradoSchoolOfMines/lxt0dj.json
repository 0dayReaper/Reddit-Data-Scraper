    "postText": "Has anyone else in CSCI262 been constantly getting low scores on assignments for dumb reasons? On the projects I feel like I do really well then I lost points for things that aren't even true. Like saying the program crashes, when I know it doesn't. or I didn't submit all the files, which I did. I've even reached out to the graders about this and they admitted they messed something up and then gave me a higher grade. Then I lose like 15% on the midterm just because of an error in my written code portion. I wrote the logic correctly which is what I figured was important, but they get on my case over all the syntax and whatever. Like of course that's going to happen if you aren't writing in a compiler. So yeah I'm just interested in other people's experience here because I'm really getting sick of the CS department's poor grading.",

            "comment": "I'm not in Data Structures now but I've taken it recently. Couple of things to look into:\n\n&gt; program crashes, when I know it doesn't\n\nThis could be for a number if reasons. If I remember correctly, CSCI262 uses C++ so I would check a couple of things..\n\nAre you using the same edition as the graders? C++17 features won't always work if the class is using C++14.\n\nAlso, do you have the same stack size as the graders? Recursive code that isn't properly structured may go too deep and exceed the stack size. If you increased your stack to get something to run, you should change it back to the default or ask the professor what they are using or recommend.\n\nIt's either something like that, something deeper in your machine, or your code just didn't work.\n\n&gt; or I didn't submit all the files, which I did.\n\nDid you maybe forget to include your makefile? Or maybe you didn't submit a readme or something like that?\n\n&gt; I wrote the logic correctly which is what I figured was important, but they get on my case over all the syntax or whatever\n\nSorry to say but unless you were asked to write pseudocode, it makes sense to lose points for incorrect syntax. Logic is important but it doesn't matter if it's not implemented correctly (or even worse, the program doesn't run)\n\n&gt; Like of course that's going to happen if you aren't writing in a compiler.\n\nThat's not a great way to think about it tbh... Coding within an IDE is super handy since they typically catch syntax errors, but I wouldn't rely on them too much since you won't always be able to use one. Think of an IDE like a nail gun; It's really nice and saves time, but you should know how to use a hammer just in case.\n\nOverall, it could be the TAs or professor goofing up (everyone makes mistakes) but it's way more common for CS students to make mistakes without even realizing, just given the nature of CS. Data Structures is one of those classes that starts requiring you to think like a computer scientist rather than a programmer. It's a tough class but it's one of the few classes that you'll continually use, so it's pretty important that you know how to handle different structures correctly. I would check in with your professor, make sure your IDE and compiler are set up correctly, and try to write your code as simple and solid as possible from now on. Easier said than done but it's all part of the learning experience\ud83e\udd72",

It's like in class we learn about basic recursion, and then they throw two (or 3 depending on how you count the first) projects at us with recursion that is far past basic. Project 3 will either be a breeze, or a hellscape. No inbetween. I also know that the TA's are working on fixing the rubric. But on Project 1 part 2, I got knocked off for my code not working with a data set that I could not test myself. All the data sets they provided (and the ones I made myself) all worked just fine with my code. Then they throw in an absolutely massive untestable data set and poof, I now have a C for the project. Definitely seems like a weed out class (which seems consistent with this class at other universities).",

    "postText": "I'm currently majoring in mechanical engineering and considering a minor in robotics &amp; intelligent systems, but I'm starting to think it might not be worth it due to being overloaded. I enjoy building robots, but after looking at all the pre-requisites it seems like I don't need to take every single class needed for the minor to take certain classes. Has anyone else experienced something similar? How are the higher-level classes for this minor?",

If you've got the energy / willpower / availability to earn a minor, its certainly worth it.",

The admissions person (who was the head of the Structural Biology department) said that she'd accept me since I had a minor in a Biotechnology field and had taken a bunch of bio-oriented classes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy situation might be different than yours since the BiomedE minor shared a lot of stuff with ChemE and bio track courses (I think I only had to take like 3 classes for the minor). If your minor requires too many classes/isn't in a spicy field for your future goals, you can consider another minor",

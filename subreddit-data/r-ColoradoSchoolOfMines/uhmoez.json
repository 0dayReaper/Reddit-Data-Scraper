            "comment": "So I will give you minimums, and then I will give recommended (balance of price and practicality). Keep in mind that a students first year of work will utilize mostly general programs like MS office, and on the rare occasions a freshman has to do any 3D modeling, those requirements can be satisfied by a school computer. Yes, it is nice to be able to do the modeling programs on a personal computer, but it's really up to the student if they wanna load those programs onto their personal computer, or just use the school computers.\n\nMy recommendations will assume the student wishes to run these programs on their personal device, otherwise any laptop will honestly suffice.\n\nOS: Most commonly people use **windows**, as many programs are exclusively windows. Some people including myself use MAC, but we end up giving in and installing windows on our MAC through the officially supported Bootcamp. If the student doesn't have any particular attachment to MAC OS, I would recommend they choose a windows, but if they choose a **MAC, they aren't SOL.**\n\nRAM: 4gb is the honest minimum, **8gb is more reasonable**, and anything above 16gb is a luxury with diminishing returns unless they are gaming. \n\nStorage: Mines offers cloud services on the Microsoft platform, but there also exist the free ones like google drive. This however is usually going to take up only a small portion of the students storage usage, and here I say: **64GB is the minimum**, and may become a big struggle after software updates and 3D applications are installed. I recommend at least **128GB**, but more realistically support **256GB+ for the peace of mind**. If the student does choose the route of running windows on a mac, their storage will be partitioned, and I recommend 256GB minimum for the mac.\n\nProcessor: An i3 is really only going to get you by if you don't wanna do modeling of any kind. Its the base model literally, and thus the minimum I can recommend. Honestly and **i5 will be a strong balance of performance of cost**. I've done plenty of modeling on an i5. Anything above that is a luxury, and will have diminishing returns unless you are using crazy amounts of cpu heavy processes. Generation wise, I would say a minimum would be the 7th generation, but I would recommend a **9th generation** or newer. The nice thing about newer cpu's is that their **integrative graphics** performance will be plenty for light and mild CAD work. \n\nA dedicated **graphics card is not truly necessary for mild CAD work**, but it is recommended for high levels of modeling, and for any sort of gaming that uses anything above medium textures. This space varies highly, and is the only part I'm going to intentionally omit a recommendation. If you wish to know the GPU performance of a particular card, plenty of online sources will tell you the expected FPS for the card on various settings. \n\nPorts: This is all based on the compromise you are willing to accept, as many new computers omit standard USB A and only have USB C ports. Your student will likely need to interact with a USB A port, and can meet this need with a $10 adapter, or just by purchasing a computer with one. This is honestly not a big issue either way, as someone on campus is bound to have an adapter with them. What I highly recommend is that the laptop has a **standard charger (USB C), instead of a proprietary one**. There will be days that you forget your charger and need to use a friends, or even worse, if your charger breaks, at least you can still charge with other USB C around. \n\nDisplay: I'll keep it simple, look for something **13\" -17\"**. \n\nSmaller = more squinting. Larger= more weight on your back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHopefully this is enough to get a general idea of what to look at. Students at Mines are hard workers, and will find a way to do their work no matter what tech they have. But if you wanna treat your son to a nicer piece of tech, it may end up making his quality life at this school better. Keep us updated, and ask any questions you have.\n\nBest of Luck!",

            "comment": "I would suggest a windows computer over a Mac. All the other specs are more up to your budget, but try to get something that can easily run engineering software that takes up a lot of ram. Also think about the storage. There will be lots and lots of files on his computer by the end of college.",

            "comment": "75% of the time that I needed to use specific engineering software for classes, I did it on a school computer instead of my laptop. Only thing I installed on my own laptop was Mathematica.\n\n**Most software that you'll use in school is less stressful on the computer than a modern video game.** With the exception of \"I wrote inefficient code to solve an improperly-typed equation\", that can rail a supercomputer let alone a laptop. Most new students overestimate how much their computer matters coming into freshman year.\n\nGet a Windows machine unless you're a Linux buff (in which case you should look at CS rather than petro). Most engineering software is written for Windows, because most computers in an office setting are Windows machines. It can become a mark against you when you start applying for jobs if you don't know how to work Windows, because most companies don't want to shell out the extra money to get their employees macs (unless you work for Apple), or their IT doesn't want to waste time and effort supporting multiple platforms.\n\nI've said 4GB RAM minimum, 8GB recommended for years...but we're really starting to get to where 4GB is super limiting. I wouldn't buy a new computer with less than 8GB RAM. Bonus points for 12GB, 16GBis a little overkill unless you're a gamer or are addicted to tons of tabs in chrome at once.\n\nOther than that, /u/_Uxie_ said it all.",

Just get what's useful to you otherwise, since pretty much anything will easily handle the basic Office stuff a laptop is actually useful for.",

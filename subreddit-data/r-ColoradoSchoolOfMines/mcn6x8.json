You have a lot of unpack here.\n\nFirst thing, the rigor is rea, but if you go in with the mentality that you might fail then you probably won't do well. That ACT isn't stellar but I knew other people with the same ACT and they did fine. Also the rigor sort of depends on the major. ChemE for example is notorious for being insanely difficult. EE is pretty tough as well (but I know an idiot who made their way through EE so).\n\nYou speak about graduating with a potentially low gpa. For the record, the average GPA at Mines is lower than a 3.0. I think last time I heard, it was a 2.9. I got a 42% on a test once. 42%. But I ended up getting a BS and an MS in 5 years and had great job offers at the end of my education. You will fail tests and you need to be okay with that. \n\nIt is NOT worth it if you hate your life. Who cares if you have a job at the end of 4 years if you were totally miserable, made no friends, lost your self confidence ect.  You have to be smart enough to leave if it gets that bad. \n\nTo your questions\n1. Yes, the professors are generally helpful, almost every department has tutoring resources available. As for mental health resources, there is a counseling center but... They aren't... The best? \n\n2. The culture can be work hard /play hard. People generally help each other. Everyone is being crushed together, which is nice. At a school like ASU you'll be crying in the library while a fill-in-the-blank major has a coloring assignment or some shit. \n\n3. The major benefit is the reputation the school has in industry. Not ALL industries though. I've spoken to people on the east coast that literally thought I went to university of phoenix or something. \n\n4.",

Cause the work already is soul sucking.\n\nFive. Idk what ASU is like so I don't know\n\nSix. The ME department is over stressed at the moment. I would encourage EE so you can get more attention from professors. It's a much smaller major.\n\nEleven. My mental health was okay because I took it seriously! I got sleep every night. I didn't overload myself. I spent time with people that were good for my happiness. Mines attracts some masochistic type people. You need to not feed in to that.\n\nTwelve. Yes you are. I know it's a big choice but damn. You can always transfer. Also do not let your parents force you in to choosing mines.",

Some jobs will definitely care about it, sure, but in my opinion project, internship, and research experience can be way more beneficial. You can't really talk about your GPA in interviews, but if you learn to flex those types of experiences it's a real good look.",

I am a first year in the BSE/EDNS program and am currently taking entry level classes because I am an awful test taker and didn't get the AP credit to get out of them. The courses can be very rigorous yes, but what ive found is that I can always find someone willing to help. People here that ive interacted with are very similar in mindsets and personalities so I have found it much easier to work with people than I ever anticipated. I was also very nervous about failing before I got here but I just had to suck it up and do my best and be determined to prove myself wrong because I enjoy being here so much. I have had really good professors and that has also helped tremendously.\n\nI think in the end yes you are overthinking it and in my case it really boils down to where do you *see* yourself. It's cheesy yes, I used to make fun of people for just *feeling* that their college was the place for them, but if you resonate with a small college that's TikTok bio is *\"Where nerd culture meets mountain life\"* and calls their IT assistants *\"Jedis\"*  and puts geeky jokes into every possible situation *(see the ads for things like this years E-Days (*[*http://www.minesactivitiescouncil.com/edays*](http://www.minesactivitiescouncil.com/edays)*) )* then I think you should seriously consider coming here. Feeling \"at home\" or \"belonging\" somewhere changes your world and you will find everything a lot easier like that.\n\nI hope this helped, it seemed like you've been thinking very technically (like a true engineer) and wanted to offer some of my own \\~emotional\\~ insight. Feel free to message me if you want to know anything else.",

Literally, that\u2019s not an exaggeration. I struggled with and hated math through my entire childhood and teens. \n\nTook a year off and did a quick pivot when I was 19, decided I actually DID want to learn math and in the course of doing so found out that I was really interested in engineering. \n\nI graduated from the electrical engineering program in December with a 3.2. Not an amazing GPA, but if you told me at 16 that one day I\u2019d pass calculus 3 I\u2019d have pissed myself laughing. I believe if you\u2019re truly interested then you can cultivate the discipline to learn anything.   \n\nDon\u2019t stress about what the other kids did in high school that you didn\u2019t. I also used to worry about that all the time. Four years later, I have a silver diploma that says it doesn\u2019t matter.",

You have to be able to bounce back. I once got like a 35 on a test but still did find in the class. It\u2019s definitely a tight knit community and knowing that everybody else is going through the same thing helps a lot. Mines has a very high placement for jobs after graduation. I forget the exact percentage but you can look it up for each department online.",

            "comment": "Junior at mines here: mines is not really that bad. I got a 26 on act and I'm doing fine, also didn't do any AP classes or whatever. Currently sitting at a 3.7 gpa. Culture is generally pretty good, you just have to find a fun group of people. I would reccomend a learning community for your first year, I did ALC, they are a great way to meet people. Alot of student do fun outdoor stuff on the weekends which eases up the stress if school. \nAdmiattly there is a section of students(50% of the school?) who never leave their room and get really stressed/depressed. I didn't think it was super hard to find friends with similar interests though. \n\nAs for the resources, they are about what I would expect. Every class has decent tutoring and professors are pretty helpful. I had a harder time my freshman/softmore year because the classes are bigger and the professors don't help as much, but mines classes are still smaller than most other universities. \n\nI have generally found my classes to be enjoyable and applicable, and with a few exceptions especially early on, I liked them.\n\nOne good thing about mines for you is that you don't really have to choose a major until the end of your softmore year or so, because there are a bunch of gen-eds you have to do first. I personally switched softmore year without issue.\n\nI'm an EE. Most professors are pretty good, and will take feedback about their classes. Coulston is especially good, probably one of my favorite teachers. Advisors are kinda non-existent. The ee major classes are all doable, but quite math heavy. \nThe ee department is not the best for finding friends in my experience. To me it seems that there are more cagey people in it. It also has one of the worst gender ratios.",

            "comment": "Alright, current mines student here, so I'm biased, but I wholeheartedly recommend giving mines a shot, I noticed a lot of the qualms that you had were similar to the ones that I worried about going into mines a couple years ago, like test scores and prospective GPAs, but I can tell you with certainty that mines is so much more worth any other place that I have been able to find just from the support that you can get. Aside from just the community being fantastic, along with any friends you make along the way, they have wonderful counseling center, academic advising, and a system really built to help students pursue their career in the best way possible. Things like CASA, CARE, and major advisors down the line I'll make for a much kinder experience than I had anticipated. \n\nThis isn't to say mines isn't without its flaws, like you say the coursework will be difficult. You will likely compare yourself to the other students. However there's always going to be a spectrum. You may be getting a C in a class, but you will have a friend who's getting an A, and another who is failing it. This is not to say any of these people are less intelligent than the others, it's just to say that mine's classes are strategically made to be absolutely horrendously difficult, until you start getting into that perfect major where things will start clicking into place much more. For example, despite having a perfect 4.0 GPA and getting salutatorian in high school, my core class is average at a C level. However, my major specific classes have been much higher, A's and B's. This is just to say that core classes are intentionally difficult here, and you will find quickly that comparing yourself to others in them is kind of pointless, because you will really only excel in the things that you will want to pursue. \n\nGiven your listed anticipated measures, I'm not sure mines can help much in aerospace, I believe that can be achieved through a mechanical degree, but both electrical engineering and computer science (computer engineering) have the same first semester classes. In fact my brother, who went to mines was a computer engineering degree, was one class off from electrical engineering minor. there's a lot of overlap, and especially early on you can decide which you find more interesting fairly quickly. And if you find it's not for you, there's a ton of entry level courses that can introduce you to a ton of different topics. For example I just needed a random science course for my second semester at mines, and took Earth and Environmental science. lo and behold, I found this so interesting that I swapped from an electrical engineering degree to a geological engineering degree. Never have I been more happy with the decision. And I really think that that is indicative of the quality that mines provides.\n\nThis is sort of been rambly but I hope it's provided some insight for you? At the end of the day the worst that can happen is dropping out and beginning to attend ASU instead. Albeit is stressful thought, in reality it isn't so hard, because mines credits can transfer, so things like calculus, chemistry, physics, even design one can be moved around if you decide within your first year that mines just isn't for you. And I know it's a big financial investment, but it in the long run can be such a boon that it's simply worth taking on.\n\nI hope that this helps a little bit, and reminder to take a break now and then! Don't let this choice stress you out too much, just do what feels right to you and everything else will fall into place.",

            "comment": "I went to ASU and my son goes to Mines.  I recommend ASU for you.  I advised my son do not go to Mines if you are not sure you want engineering.  It is not worth the money and trouble to transfer if you change your mind.  Also Mines doesn\u2019t really have an aerospace program.\n\nI worried about my son not getting exposure to non-engineering peers.  There truly is something to be said for a well-rounded education, though I know it is more unpopular these days because people don\u2019t want to pay the rising cost of tuition unless they can get a job from it.  ASU is HUGE and there are so many majors to choose from and it would be so easy for you to change if you decide to.\n\nOf the schools I applied to, ASU had the lowest admission standards and I had high grades.  I worried that the peers would not be challenging enough for me or that the quality of the education would be inadequate.  However I think the quality was excellent.  My friend\u2019s son does engineering there and says it is almost too challenging.  My engineering student friends definitely worked hard at school (mind you that was 30 years ago).  When we were deciding I kept telling my son that ASU engineering school is actually rated more highly than Mines (I think, or very close) in USNews and World Report.  If tuition is less and I bet it is, seriously consider it if you are truly open to it.\n\nThey say ASU is a party school and that scares parents.  I did not party there.  Maybe don\u2019t live in Manzanita.  I lived on the south side over by Gammage and it was quieter there.  But you may be on the other campus now so not sure that is helpful.  \n\nYou are choosing between very small and gigantic.  Big difference.  Something to consider for sure.",

They apparently include things like admission rate and endowment size, and they're also research-focused, which is fine for big research universities but not very helpful for industry-focused schools like Mines (and much less relevant for undergrads regardless; the rankings they publish for free are grad school rankings).\n\nAs a transfer student, my first university was ranked higher than Mines in CS by about 30 places (~70 vs ~100).  Comparing the CS majors I knew there and what I heard from the seniors (started as a CS major) to the ones I know here... nope.  No way.  They were, however, a much larger research university.",

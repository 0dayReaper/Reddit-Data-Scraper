I play bass in my school\u2019s varsity orchestra and wouldn\u2019t mind carrying some musical aspect into college, so I\u2019m thinking about the VPA TLC. However, I just need a bit more information as to what I\u2019m actually applying for. Thanks a bunch :)",

TLCs will host little community nights here and there, as well as a handful of excursions throughout the year. you'll be interacting with these people since each TLC is based in its own dorm.\n\nsome TLCs are better established than others, there's some out there where you'll maybe meet once and do a service project and that'll be it. but VPA, as well as Athleticism and Wellness, are some of the tightest communities. \n\n2021-2022, i decided to live in Morgan hall not knowing that it hosted a TLC, so it turned out that half of the second and third floors were members of VPA. it seemed dope and i already had experience with piano and graphic design so i just asked to tag along in their outings and stuff. easy honorary vpa member",

Definitely a fun time, and nobody was a visual arts major or anything so we were all still engineering students primarily and the VPA was just a side hobby. They were pretty chill about skill levels in the big choir, more selective with the small groups. Not sure if things have changed in the past 5 years.",

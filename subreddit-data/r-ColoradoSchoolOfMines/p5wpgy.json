You check your name off the attendance sheet when you get there and from there you\u2019re free to workout however you want for the hour. Realistically you could leave after 20 minutes and be fine. Pretty chill class",

            "comment": "I've taken both courses, there is functionally no difference between the two. \n\nIn Beginning there is usually a little demo of some of the equipment.\n\nIn Advanced, most of the experience weight lifters take it, so you have people who are comfortable spotting you.\n\nI'd take whatever works better with your schedule, because you'll have to shower afterward for either one.\n\nCompared to using the Rec, the weight-training classes are less crowded, you don't have to wait for the equipment, but the class is only once a week, and to build muscle at any significant rate, you should workout at minimum 2-3 times a week. But, if you want to get a workout in and get PA credit its good for that.",

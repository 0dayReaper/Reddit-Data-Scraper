    "postText": "I\u2019m glad my courseload is more than 12 credits so I might not have to take summer classes, but my course list goes as follows\u2026\n\n1.) Calculus 1\n\n2.) Chemistry 1\n\n3.) Design\n\n4.) Nature\n\n5.) Physical Education\n\n6.) Freshman Success\n\nNow I know that two of these classes might not take up much of my time (Freshman Success and PE), but that should still amount to about 5 classes of work. That isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, but I hear a lot on this sub about how much harder prerequisites are than they should be.\n\nBasic question is if this schedule would be okay or if I\u2019m in for a long semester? I know this will depend a lot on teachers and time management (which I think I did fairly well in high school), but I want to gage how hard this would be?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Freshmen classes will give you what you need, just know that the professors aren't going to hold your hand (though they will lend a helping hand if you ask). The big thing for your first semester is just learning how to pace your self and how to use Google and WolframAlpha for everything you don't know. \n\nTL;DR: Enjoy your summer, deal with college as it ramps up.",

Calculus 1 (and most math classes in general) can be busy depending on how much homework your professor gives. I had one or two short assignments every week. \n\nI didn't take Chem 1 due to AP credit, but my Chem 2 homework several semesters ago consisted mainly of weekly online problem sets (maybe 40-50 problems per set) which was manageable if you understood the material and didn't put it of til the last day. Nature and Human Values (NHV) coursework may depend on the professor. However, when I took it we mainly focused on reading short texts on our own time and then discussing them in class as a group. \n\nPersonally my most stressful class during my freshman year was Design. This was mainly because the pacing was very rough in that some weeks we would hardly do anything in class and then weeks later we were supposed to present or turn something in, and we hadn't been working on it those past few weeks. Our final presentation was massively dumbed down due to Mines going remote, but I heard from other students that they are typically very involved.",

            "comment": "You should be fine with this schedule. Freshman Success and PE take up basically no time at all; you just have to show up. If this is gonna feel like 5 classes, it\u2019ll be because of the labs for Chem and Design. \n\nCalc I doesn\u2019t have a massive workload, and NHV shouldn\u2019t either (although I hear it depends a lot on what prof you get). I think your biggest sources of work are gonna be Chem I and Design. Chem is simply a lot a of busy work thanks to the lab, but it\u2019s not too difficult as long as you go to class and ask questions when you need to. As the semester goes on, Design will prove to be a much more involved class than you might initially think. Even the COVID version that I took ended up being hard to keep up with at the end. A ton of that depends on how ambitious you are with your project, though.\n\nBasically, the workload for this semester will be significant, but definitely not out of the ordinary for Mines. The really hard prereqs are Phys I and II and maybe Chem II and Calc II.\n\nGood luck!",

I know experience and GPA will play a big part for it, but I'm just curious how many people have gotten full time job offers for the following spring/summer from a fall career fair.",

It's the best chance you have as a Mines student to land a job before you graduate.  \n\nYou'll do great, GPA doesn't matter and experience only a little, if you're personable you'll get a job.  This year is back to precovid numbers and places are hiring!",

I think as you progress it becomes more hands-on, which is probably the same for other universities\n\nHowever, if you really put yourself out there and try to get involved, you can get a lot of hands on learning experiences. I was able to get on some research teams because I just asked. My experience so far has been is that there are opportunities available, but you have to go after them and can't expect for them to just land at your feet.",

There are a few teachers who are really passionate and excited like Dr. Kinzli or Dr. Marr. \n\nPlenty of hands on opportunities. EPICS 1 and 2 are hands on project classes. Then theres different enviro labs that focus on the chem side of things. Plenty of hands on labs. Also theres Field Session which puts you in the field working over the summer. i'd say 30% of classes provide experience but nothing close to what internships provide. \n\n\n\nMy experience: the most fun I never want to have again. Ive met some cool people who have made my time here much better. Its the people that make the school fun, not the actual school part. If i were choosing again i'd come here mostly based on the salary offer i received. This school has a good name, but the admin doesn't care about student well being compared to expansion.",

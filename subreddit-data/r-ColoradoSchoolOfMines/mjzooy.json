I went up to a company and asked about what type of internships they would be hiring for with the degree I was planning on getting, because I didn't really see the relationship. Their answer was 'we aren't'. Will then, glad I just spent that time taking to y'all. Now that I'm in construction, I'm glad they weren't. I've only heard horror stories of how they never you around so frequently you know no one and are expected to work 70+ hrs",

Any division.\n\nWhen I talked to them during career fair they asked if I was interested in getting my Professional Engineering licensure. I responded, \"Yes, it is beneficial to civil engineers.\" Both reps response was \"Oh, you won't fit at our company. Several things you have said make it sound like you won't be happy.\" PE licensure was the only thing mentioned other than that heavy civil was interesting to me (which is all that the division there that year did). I wanted an internship, 3 months of work at most.  \n\nMy father in law worked for them in the 80's. They haven't changed since then.",

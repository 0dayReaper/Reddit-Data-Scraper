    "postText": "Just a quick question. Does anyone know where engineering physics students mostly take classes? I can't seem to find a building on the website tour that houses engineering physics students. Would it be the Coortek center for applied sciences? I could have sworn it was an older building when I toured two years ago. Thanks for all the help!",

I\u2019ll always have some fond memories of Meyer (having spent a significant amount of time there), but it definitely had a very \u201cinstitutional\u201d feel.",

I have to admit I got a good laugh out of the \u201cOut of Order\u201d sign on the elevator. The one in Meyer was always broken too. Have to keep some traditions alive ;)",

Also see if you can get a tour of the GRLA (General Research Laboratory Annex) if you are talking to someone from the physics department. Main two rooms of interest in coor's Tek for classes is the advanced lab and electronics lab",

Multiple years ago, when CoorsTek was still being built in the spot where Meyer was demolished in ~2016, a lot of physics classes were held in the CTLM building. \n\nBut if it was only 2 years ago, then CoorsTek was still the main physics building at the time. Though, like another commenter mentioned, there are other buildings like GRLA that are also used by the department.",

Would having a lot of credits give me priority registration? I\u2019ve looked at the credit transfer form and am not certain what value there is to AP Gov and AP ES since I have all my free electives covered by other AP classes.",

My knowledge is a bit outdated (high school '18) but if you actually took Calc 1 in high school, understood it, and did not have trouble getting A's on tests, you should absolutely NOT take calc 1 again. The exception is if you didn't get it the first time, because you will be using that knowledge going forward.",

I came in already receiving credit for Calc 1, 2, Phys 1, and most of my free electives and am very grateful I did. Was able to get a minor in 4 years with being several courses ahead. Saves you some money too if you didn\u2019t want to go a minor route. Also, could make your senior year load less if that\u2019s appealing to you. Also, getting out of Mines in 4 looks better than 4.5 etc, nobody has to know you did a semester in HS.",

I only had algebra-based physics in HS, so that didn't transfer to Mines. That was probably for the best in my situation, as getting to know the physics department led to me majoring in physics (woe unto me when I hit that junior year workload, though).\n\nI think the biggest problem with skipping classes at Mines is more of the classic problem of \"I was a straight A student without trying in HS, but suddenly everybody around me was ALSO a straight A student and I have to try way harder\". It's a big adjustment for some people to make, and easier to make that adjustment in Calc I than Calc III or Diff EQ.",

Would I struggle in mechanical engineering and instead should do something like materials engineering? (I want to build machines for manufacturing processes if that helps)",

            "comment": "I started at Mines in 2015 and graduated in 2019 with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. I was a roughly B student in my high school math classes and never really cared for it, so your situation sounds very similar to mine. It was a very difficult adjustment at first. Even when I committed to going to office hours, starting the homework early, never missing a lecture, etc., I was still getting Cs in the math classes, although I thankfully never had to repeat one. \n\nIn my experience, I became better at math just because of how often I had to use it. Excluding straight-up math classes, you still use the concepts in chemistry, physics, along with all your major-specific classes. Even after my first math class at Mines, there was a noticeable improvement in my math literacy.\n\nAfter the initial adjustment, the mathematical concepts of solving the problems was not the hard part. Thinking about the problem and the tools I could use to solve it was always harder than setting up the problem mathematically.\n\nAs you progress through your courses at Mines, the math itself will be the least of your worries. I am inclined to say, \"Go for it\" if you are willing to deal with two or three semesters of adjustment, and comfortable with the idea of using math as a means to an end after that. If, however, you really don't like math and would rather not have to use it at all, stay away from engineering lol.\n\nAs for your goal to work in manufacturing, I would say that ME is a solid choice, although I would still \"shop around.\" You don't have to declare a major until your 3rd or 4th semester, so it's worth talking to faculty and students from a variety of majors. I do not work in manufacturing, so I can't speak to that part of your question, but I can confirm that I use math way less in my day-to-day than I did in college.\n\nI hope this helps!",

However, I can say that a lot of engineers I know post Mines in varying lines of work do no where near the amount or rigor or amount of math that was required in school. But the amount required in school was a LOT.",

I did alright during the first exam, struggled during the second, and I completely bombed the final. \n\nI barely passed the class, but the experience made me realize that I couldn't act the same way I did during highschool. Then again, I was 1 of two students taking Calc in my highschool so I doubt there was much effort being put there. Nevertheless, in the following semesters I changed my habits and really started to try. I'm doing much better now.\n\nIn short, math can be difficult. However, with the right study habits and willingness to learn from your mistakes, you'll be alright.",

Materials Engineering definitely doesn\u2019t have a lot of math, at least compared to mechanical engineering, but it is less able to get you to where you want to go. However- shop around. Change your major. Figure out what makes you happy through internships and research. That\u2019s the point of the 4 year college experience anyways",

            "comment": "Engineering in general is going to be not fun if you don't like math (NOT saying the job, I'm talking about getting through school) simply because everyone is required to take Calc 1,2,3 and diff-eq and a good chunk of people are required to take even more (i.e. lin-alg and stats) + a ton of classes like physics use a shit ton of math (physics arguably uses more math than calc does :(. \n\nThat being said, that isn't to dissuade you from picking engineering. Plenty of people here dislike many of their classes, particularly the ones that aren't pertinent to the real world. \n\nI always try to encourage people to pursue engineering with a single point of hesitation to keep in mind. Mines is an engineering only school (outside of a few other stem majors like applied math, comp sci, etc). If you do end up deciding you dislike the route you are on and want to transfer into say business, you cannot \\*without switching institutions\\*. You seem pretty dedicated to manufacturing processing so I would say you're the kind of person to thrive at Mines, but it's just something to keep in mind. \n\nMy piece of advice for you if you end up coming to mines for engineering is to make sure you understand the fundamentals. It can be really easy to blow off classes that don't interest you, but while you may not enjoy mathematics if you end up not understanding the fundamentals of calculus you are going to have a painful painful 4 years here. Either way, best of luck to you :)",

Graduated last month and the only job I got offered (out of like 25 applications) was at a company that I applied for a separate position, and they saw I had a very small amount of experience in an area from field session and they offered me a job they hadn\u2019t listed yet. Just look for places that might do something you have done or have a strong interest in, even if it\u2019s just a little bit of experience it could go a long way.",

            "comment": "Two of the best things you can do for yourself: apply to jobs early and do not take the job requirements too literally. \n\nMost of the people I know either had signed with a company shortly after the fall career day because they had been grinding the applications or were still looking up to graduation. Companies have hiring cycles and they tend to coincide with career fairs since they would love to know how many people will be coming in next year. Plus the fall career day is much larger.\n\nAs for job requirements, it is much more of a wishlist for an application than actual requirements. Obviously you shouldn\u2019t apply to an electrical engineering job if you have only taken a circuits class, but don\u2019t let something minor like \u201cideal candidate will have taken [random 400 level class]\u201d stop you from applying. Some companies will have auto rejection and that is annoying, but their loss. If you\u2019re super concerned about something, include a cover letter highlighting your strengths that they want",

I got an internship at career fair so make sure you go and market yourself there! I haven't gotten a job yet but just try to get experience and apply to a lot of companies is what I've heard from my employed peers. Note it will be harder to get a job as we are in a recession but we can all do it.",

We had a senior level class this spring with 55 students and 53 had full time employment secured by March. \n\nIf I could give advice, it would be to be genuine and be forward. Be both forward about what you want and need as well as open to all kinds of different opportunities! I wouldn\u2019t pigeonhole yourself too much, and always take the interview regardless of the position. You never know which company will \u201cfeel like home\u201d and interviews are the best practice for\u2026you nailed it\u2026 more interviews. \n\nBest of luck, go Orediggers!",

Out of all the jobs I applied to over the last year (around 50+ applications total), I only started interviewing with one of them right around graduation and eventually ended up receiving an offer. \n\nI think others' advice about not taking requirements too literally is good. For example, I graduated with an ME degree and got an EE job. Also, if you're unable to land an internship, try and get a research role on campus. I was in that exact situation, and the projects I worked during research really bolstered my resume and also served as great talking points while interviewing. From there, the only (and likely the biggest) challenge was finding job listings which both excited me and aligned with the experience I gained.",

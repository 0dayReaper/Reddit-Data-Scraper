            "comment": "I\u2019ve personally found the mines gym pretty crowded when covid reservations aren\u2019t in effect but it\u2019s overall a pretty nice rec center. I personally really like the track that is up above the basketball courts because it\u2019s more private. There\u2019s usually a small room with medicine balls and some dumbbells right off of the track that is really empty. For some reason they took all that stuff out recently so you can really only do body weight stuff and cardio up there right now but it\u2019s still my fav.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to lift you\u2019ll have to go early in the morning if you want to be guaranteed a rack but the weight room is pretty well equipped.",

There's also a room to the side with some treadmills/open space for yoga etc. As far as hours go, I've never found the gym too busy at any time of the day, but usually if you go after 7-8 significantly less people will be there.",

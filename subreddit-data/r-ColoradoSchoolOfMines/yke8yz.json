    "postText": "hello, i just had a question about how common is it to actually take longer than the four years to graduate. i came from a below average high school that didn\u2019t really have many opportunities to obtain college credit prior to attending an university so i came here with 0 credits. now, i am incredibly behind in comparison to a lot of students here and i would like to know if there is a reason to even try to get a BS here, especially since it looks like i will have to retake a class on top of my lack of credits or what are the downsides of the extra time it\u2019ll take.",

Aside from transferring to a less expensive school, the best way to mitigate that is to take classes from community colleges when possible instead of Mines.",

But it totally depends on you.",

The course catalog for all majors is mapped out to finish in 4 years without bringing credits with you.  Many people from your same situation have done it before you and you can do it too.  There\u2019s also nothing wrong with extending it to 5 years. \n\nI may be a counterpoint to other prospectives but finishing in 4 years and getting paid an engineering salary with freedom to spend that salary traveling and experiencing life is worth the grind.  You can take 5, 6, 7 years and nobody that matters is going to judge you by how long you want to take to finish.  I will say earning money and enjoying life has been loads more fun than spending extra years at college.",

If you have to choose between having a good time and really understanding but taking five years and being miserable and drowning from lack of understanding in four.

I did it with a combination of summer and juco/community college and some really careful credit management. I changed majors once and primary schools once and got really lucky in that transfer where the dean did my transfer and was super lenient.",

There are also \"weed out\" classes early on that are designed to suck so taking those at Red Rocks would probably help you understand the material and make it less stressful. Honestly, take all the time you need to get a college degree. The labor market is demand heavy and short on supply so even if you decide to go straight to work, make some money, then take the transfer pathway from Red Rocks to Mines you'll still end up successful.",

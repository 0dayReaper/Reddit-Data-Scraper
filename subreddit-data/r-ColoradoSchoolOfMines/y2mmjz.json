TBP is a very recognized organization with a few of the following people as members: (Jeff Bezos, Donald Knuth, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Bloomberg to name a few).   \nSo TBP gives you access to a bunch of connections and TBP has career fairs that are only eligible to members. Furthermore, employers recognize it as it's the oldest and most highly acclaimed engineering honor society.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR really easy requirements at Mines, lots of notable members, looks good",

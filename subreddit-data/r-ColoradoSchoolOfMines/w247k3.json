I was thinking about storing camping and snowboarding gear in there when I\u2019m not using it and I wanted to know if that would be possible. Thanks!",

You might be able to store some stuff, just know it sitting on the floor there for the taking of anyone with access to the locker",

            "comment": "The locker was more dangerous than keeping it in your dorm or even outside because there\u2019s no functioning camera (at least at Elm). I bought it and used it once and other people scratched the hell out of my bike and the bike rack popped my tire. Definitely NOT with it. Stopped using it after that\n\nInside there are pretty large lockers kind of like at some gyms or locker rooms, which each person also gets. If you get a padlock you can keep some stuff in there which would be pretty secure. Still I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth $200",

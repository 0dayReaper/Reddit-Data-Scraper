No fucking communication from the professor. \n\nAssignments are fucking all over the place and pack back Is a garbage platform.\n\nThe assignments are giant wastes of time and  are not intellectually engaging in the slightest. \n\nThen the professor just dumps a final research project on you last minute.  \n\nWhy the fuck is this class required?\n\nThis is just a useless weed out course \n\nFuck Econ class",

Then right after i took econ at mines, they changed the policy so i only needed macro econ. So basically i took econ here for nothing.",

I like Mines, but fuck...this school *really* shits the bed on a handful of classes for which there is absolutely no excuse to be so bad, and Econ is right there at the top of that list. Like, it's Econ -it's not at all an obscure, high level topic. I think I could point to any random *high school* in the Denver metro, and I bet they teach econ better than Mines. I think I could pick any random engineering professor here, and I would bet that they could teach econ better than the actual econ profs we have here. There is really no excuse for it to be as pathetic of a class as it is, and at this point it's a choice being actively made by Mines to keep it as bad as it is. So pissed I had to take that dog shit class.",

The basic economic concepts are important to an engineering career, because if you're trying to make money (which *is* ultimately the goal in most engineering roles) you frequently need to determine whether the time/effort/materials needed for a product improvement are going to be justified by increased sales later on. Knowing basic economics and being able to model the effect of your change makes you a more valuable engineer.\n\nNow, was Econ a total dumpster fire of a class when I was there? Fuck yeah. Sounds like it still is. The problem isn't the topic, it's the teaching.\n\nEdit: I'd like to know whether the person who downvoted me is an alumnus with a job, or a student who's convinced they know what the job market wants before they've really entered it.",

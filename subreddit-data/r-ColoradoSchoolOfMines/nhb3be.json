I didn\u2019t take prereqs here and junior level exams are tough but not as bad as what I\u2019ve heard about weed out classes at mines. Overall, do you think it\u2019s bad? Good? Neutral?",

            "comment": "Testing at Mines has gotten better during covid. A good chunk of professors have realized that they can't effectively block access to information like in the past. This makes it so the tests are more realistic, not artificially closed like in the past.\n\nKeeping information away doesn't make sense, especially in the modern world. The vast majority of the time you will have internet access in the workplace. Even if you didn't you would have access to your past work as reference material.\n\nThe weed out courses are bad because they usually don't actually teach you anything. Physics 1 &amp; 2 is really bad about it.",

Ask me if I remember anything from linear algebra. Not a damn thing. Why? Because I could just use the course notes and figure the problems out. But since I never was put in that timed environment where you either knew it, or didn't. I never fully learned anything. \n\nI think moving forward Mines should go back to the way they've always done it. I know I learned better. Even if it was harder. Engineering is hard everyone.",

And they tend to be longer and harder since they are open resource.\n\nIf you didn't learn anything from linear algebra have you actually needed it since? I find that I lose the skills that I don't use regularly. Which also tends to indicate that it isn't too important in most aspects of my life.\n\nEngineering is hard. Engineers help the world work. That doesn't mean Mines should make tests hard rather than actually teach. My best professors have stressed less about grades, they cared about learning instead. Seeking the grade causes students to find the fastest and easiest way to the solution, oftentimes skipping the reasoning behind it. That's bad for their and by extension, our future.",

The reason I don't remember much now is because I rarely used DiffEq outside of that class, and when I did, I had to look things up to refresh my memory --- and I think that's okay. And really, access to notes or not, if you don't know the material you won't do well on a timed exam anyway (generalized opinion).",

            "comment": " Last semester I had homework and projects for every class due the Wednesday before finals, so I essentially had no time to prepare for the two exams I had Friday morning... This semester was better, partially because I had prepared myself for that to happen again, but mostly because it didn't. I don't know if it was intentional, but another difference this semester was because most of my exams were open book/note. I can't speak to the core courses because I transferred most of them in.\n\nI went to Texas A&amp;M before I came to Mines and they had an entire dead WEEK before finals, which was very helpful, obviously compared to one day to prepare for exams. I think some students asked for that but it was turned down in What's Your Beef. I think one has to give -- either give students adequate time to prepare for exams or have more reasonable accommodations (access to past materials).\n\nEdit: a word.",

My entire time here I have been trying to show others, and improve conditions, but the administration and most students don't care.\n\nI am in the Mechanical Engineering Department, it has many issues. I am glad I was finally able to help get rid of one awful professor last semester. There are many more to go but removing one that didn't know the material and lied to students and administration was a very good start. If you have any that aren't doing your department justice go to the department head, or above if needed. There are a few that care on campus.",

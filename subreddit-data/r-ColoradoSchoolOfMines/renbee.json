I haven't checked but I am sure there is a computer engineering degree or focus area at CSU. \n\nIf you haven't already looked at University of Wyoming, you should totally take a look. They have a computer engineering BS and you'll likely qualify for in-state tuition with the WUE and they also have good merit scholarships. It's only about a 20 minute drive from the Colorado border, so you are still in the area. I would be paying about 1/4 of what I do at Mines if I had gone to UW.",

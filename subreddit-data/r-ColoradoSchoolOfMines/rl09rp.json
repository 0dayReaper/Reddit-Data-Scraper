            "comment": "TLDR: I really enjoyed fall session, I think it\u2019s a more relaxed and realistic experience.\n\nI took it in the fall and know people who took it over the summer. There are pros and cons to each. \n\nThe summer sessions are a full time job for 8 weeks. It\u2019s hard work. This option won\u2019t take a large chunk out of the 19 hour max per semester. If you don\u2019t have time to take all your classes by time you want to graduate or if you just want to rip the bandage off and get it over with, take summer. This option also incurs the extra cost of taking summer classes. You\u2019ll also lose the opportunity for summer internship offers.\n\nThe fall sessions are less than 8 hours a week for the full 16-week semester. Much more relaxed environment. I believe you get a more realistic and fulfilling experience with this option. If the client takes 2 weeks to get a necessary file to you, it\u2019s not a huge problem. This happens occasionally with the summer sessions and it completely scraps any chance of completing the project because of the short timeline. Working in-person with my team was way easier than working over zoom. So if you\u2019re going home for the summer, consider that. \n\nEdit: also if you\u2019re worried about the huge lab periods that block up your schedule for the fall session, know that the class only meets during those periods 1 out of every 4 scheduled times. (Made for a TON of free time on Tuesdays and Thursdays)",

                    "comment": "I'd like to correct the post above that summer FS is *five* weeks, not eight. I prefer summer FS because how quick and focused it is (30ish hours a week for a little over a month and you're done). Fall FS drags on for over triple Summer FS time on top of your other classes. \n\nThe cost of taking summer classes is extra, but the school sends out a thing before they start where you can apply for additional finaid (or apply certain renewable scholarships you may have) for the summer. Interfering with internships is the primary downside of summer FS, but in the past students have been able to coordinate and balance with their employers and FS instructors.\n\nUltimately, your FS experience is largely dependent on your client and also if you've had previous intern experience before. I had FS with a great client before having my first internship, and it was the most useful class I ever took at Mines. On the other hand, my friends who already had internships found FS somewhat useless (even if they had good clients). Keep in mind which boat you might be in when you decide on either the summer of fall timeline.",

The advisors do a good job to help your project along and mediate any difficulties with your client (not sure if Donna is still around, but she was awesome). \n\nI do know that some people like to have full-time internships during the summer(s) they'd usually take field session. The fall option is great because it allows students to focus on internships during the summer if they'd rather. I do know of people who have attempted field session **and** an internship during the summer, if their internship was flexible... difficult but possible. \n\nAlso, field session doesn't necessarily have to eat up your entire fall semester, depending on the rigor of your project. But, it does require quite a bit of dedicated team time (as to be expected)",

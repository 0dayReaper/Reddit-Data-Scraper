    "postText": "Did anyone struggle when they took algorithms at mines? Im currently a cs senior (graduating next may) and algorithms has been the most difficult class so far. It\u2019s my third time taking it and I might need to retake it next semester again. It\u2019s been very discouraging. Coding isn\u2019t my best skill but I\u2019m trying. I still have operating systems, programming languages and embedded systems to take in order to graduate but I heard all of these classes are really hard. My overall gpa is at 2.9. I just feel so burnt out and failing algorithms has affected my mental health so badly. Going through a lot in my personal life doesn\u2019t help this either. I guess my main question is how did people study for algorithms? What worked? Any resources? How do people tackle projects? I\u2019ve reached out to my professor and TAs for help but they have been quite dismissive and expect you to know all the stuff right away. I just feel so lost and idk what to do anymore.",

Sorry that we have been dismissive :(\n\nIt's my first semester being a TA, and I am still learning the balance of how much help I need to provide to people that show up to my office hours. I don't know if it's been you, but I know there have been times when people left still confused :(\n\nGenerally though, take advantage of office hours. Especially the w/f in class office hours when you have access to Dinesh. \nAlso, don't shy away from looking up explanations for concepts online. No offense to Dinesh, but uh, if you are going to have to be learning from YouTube videos anyway, then you might as well find some better ones. In particular, I like the algorithms videos on Abdul Bari's YouTube channel.",

Also, during office hours, how do I ask for help like for me I\u2019m mostly struggling with putting the concepts into code and how it all comes together. I\u2019m so confused and lost, I just don\u2019t know what to ask \ud83d\ude2d I have mostly been emailing the prof or TAs for help esp for the DP project but I know it\u2019s hard to give advice over email.",

From the TAs perspective, it is much easier to answer specific questions so we can be of more help.   \n\n\nAlso, I think Rem mentioned in her reply to your email that scheduling a meeting with a TA is an option. Crowded office hours can make it very difficult to get to a satisfactory answer to a question without being interrupted by the TA having to move on to someone else.",

Not sure if you go on w/f but those classes the professor does a pretty good job of leading you to the right answer. \n\nI also found that watching the videos on Monday and getting a head start on quizzes/worksheets is really helpful for coming to class with questions",

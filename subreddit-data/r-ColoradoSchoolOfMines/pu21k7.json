I got my application back sometime in December (i submitted my application in late October). Looking back on those stressful months of waiting for my acceptance letters to come back, the best thing i could have done is just not worry about it. If you are applying to schools this good, chances are you are going to get in somewhere good. I think you will be surprised on the schools you will get in to. Also, if it takes them a long time to get to your application, don\u2019t assume it is a rejection. I got in to USC about two days before the last day i could get my application back.",

    "postText": "Most of the books from hass are long and hard to get through so I usually opt for the audiobook to listen while driving or taking a walk, saves loads of time. Usually they\u2019re easy to find on audible or amazon but the book we\u2019re reading for the second half of summer hass 307 (Gods Bits of Wood) does not exist on any platform.\n\nAfter scouring the internet for 3 hours, I finally found a surprisingly decent quality audio version on a weird website asking nearly $200 for it. So I got a little creative and shadow downloaded an encrypted copy, manually broke the xml encryption, extracted 55 arbitrary audio files and repackaged them into the common m4b format. Then all I did was drop the output file into iTunes and it uploaded to my phone as a audiobook organized by chapter and everything.\n\nGiven how much time I wasted on this I wanted to share this magic [m4b file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/h3bp3jjqz028kr7/magicfile.m4b/file) in case anyone else in hass 307 wants audio for Gods Bits of Wood. The prof said that the reading usually doesn\u2019t change semester to semester so it might be handy if you take the class in the future, idk. It\u2019s super easy on iOS just connect your iphone and drag the file into iTunes. Should also work on android just haven\u2019t tested it.",

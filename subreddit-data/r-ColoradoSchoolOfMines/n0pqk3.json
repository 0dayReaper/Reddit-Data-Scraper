            "comment": "The Outdoor Rec Center at Mines offers a discounted IKON pass which is going to be your cheapest option. Not sure about the ski club but because the IKON pass is the only one offered most of the students who ski get that one. They also offer discounted lift tickets that vary mountain to mountain. Epic (I believe) does have a student discount but unless you\u2019re dead set on certain resorts, it\u2019s still more expensive",

I just got mine and it's $440 for the IKON Base Pass.",

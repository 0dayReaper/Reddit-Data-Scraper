    "postText": "I just found out today that I can graduate early if I move some stuff around in my upcoming course schedule, but I need to take a couple of courses at Red Rocks to fulfill the Free Electives section of Degreeworks. Has anyone taken any of those? If so, which ones, and how hard were they?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: Currently taking the 6-week course of Colorado History, as well as Human Sexuality. Colorado History is a pretty light workload, Human Sexuality has a somewhat medium courseload. HS is similar to Mines Econ in its structure, but less tedious and annoying when it's one of the only classes you're taking. Hope this helps someone else",

They were super easy I did most of them as Async online classes and they were easy A\u2019s. Literally just a discussion post every week on a 5 minute video and then 2 tests which were super easy.",

    "postText": "Hi! I am a prospective student who is gender nonconforming. I recently visited campus but am still uncertain about the support of the LGBTQ, particularly nonbinary, students on campus.\n\nOne one hand, I heard that there is a strong LGBTQ club on campus and the campus is \u201csecretly gayer\u201d than what is visible on the surface. I also saw that some professors had ally stickers on their door and some LGBTQ couples around the town.\n\nOn the other hand, when I asked about LGBTQ support on campus I felt dismissed. There also wasn\u2019t the same vocal or explicit support that I am accustomed to on the East Coast in academic spaces. No one introduced themselves with their pronouns and I also could not find gender neutral restrooms in the campus building. I also felt gawked at by some of the locals.\n\nI\u2019m curious if this is how Mines is like day to day? Are LGBTQ issues politically divisive on campus or are most of the students/professors allies? Are trans and nonbinary identities respected on campus?  I am also curious whether there is institutional support (beyond student led clubs) for LGBTQ students?\n\nSince I am not looking for confrontation or to deal with unsupportive people, normally I won\u2019t introduce myself with my pronouns unless someone else does it first. However, if I were to do that, what would the reaction be? I visited as part of an event and am wondering if that deterred students from sharing their pronouns. \n\nTLDR: Looking for perspectives from LGBTQ student about support of nonbinary students on campus.",

Most students and professors here are awkward, peaceful, and non-confrontational; I suspect that the majority would respect your pronouns. But most are not necessarily \"allies\" or particularly interested in LGBTQ causes such as you might expect of an east coast liberal arts school.",

When you have more then a surface level issue you\u2019ll get sent in circles until you give up. \nThat being said most people on campus are kind and friendly. If they misgender you or call you by the wrong pronouns 99% of people will apologize and try to do better. Of course you will find some people who just don\u2019t understand or are aholes but that\u2019s true of any population.

Mines absolutely is secretly gayer than it appears. \n\nWith that said - there are some groups on campus that are really transaphobic but in my experience that represents a minority of the students. Most students in my experience don\u2019t super care and will respect pronouns / chosen names. \n\nAll of the professors and TAs that I have had have been allies, though some are more outspoken than others (love you Westhof). \n\nI\u2019m not explicitly involved with oSTEM (our lgbt+ group), but they are often on the quad spreading awareness and hosting events on campus.\n\nWith that said I\u2019m in MLT (mines little theatre) and they are super friendly and accepting.\n\nThere is institutional support for LGBT students but in my experience it has been hit or miss.\n\nAs for introducing yourself with pronouns- I\u2019m cis and I do it when I introduce myself to classes (I\u2019m a TA) and to new groups. And the reaction has been nothing for the most part. There have a been times when people looked at me like \u201cwhy are you stating your pronouns\u201d, but that\u2019s only been once or twice. \n\nA major thing that you should know about mines is that it is not boulder and it is not super diverse. \n\nWith that said, everyone that I know states that mines feels very very safe. I know that I feel safe walking around campus and the greater golden area at night and I know that my partner feels the same. \n\nFeel free to message me if you want to chat more about this. I can also see if I can put you in contact with some other people for a different perspective as I know that my experience is not universal.",

Mines very much has the same problem in engineering and STEM fields as a whole where you are just not expected to be open about LGBTQ+ identity. My experience hasn't been entirely negative since I do have a network of support through oSTEM, friends I trust, and my department (physics) which is making active efforts in diversity, equity, inclusion, and access. (For example we just had a guest speaker the other day to talk about LGBTQ+ advocacy in physics and we have a professor who uses they/them pronouns.) As a trans person I also have the privilege of passing pretty well, so while I haven't faced any outright harassment, I know that's not true for others.0 \n\nTldr. Mines falls short on supporting queer members of its community, as it is with pretty much any marginalized group. There are many ways to find support, just don't expect it often from the administration.",

Obviously, they aren't holding pride parades or anything like that, but most of the professors, TAs, and students I've run into are supportive even if they don't know the correct steps to the dance. They'll use your pronouns and preferred names as long as you communicate directly with them about it. The bad apples are few and far in-between, and the one incident I experienced involving a TA was solved after speaking with the professor.\n\nOn the institutional level, we are failing in so many ways. There isn't the infrastructure to support non-binary students in particular in terms of gender ID. We only just recently got the ability to have a preferred name show up in our information system, but that doesn't reflect across all areas of banner. You were unable to room with the different legal sex in any residence hall except the 4th floor of Elm when I lived in the dorms. That being said, our main student organization MAC has routinely been putting on Drag Queen Bingo and oSTEM is very active.\n\nLife at Mines is fine if you don't need a strong queer community, and if you're stealth if you are trans (obviously not applicable to nb people). But I agree that you are expected to not be open about being queer",

All of my professors respected my pronouns (nb &amp; they/them pronouns) and I personally had no problems within the major. Most people I knew introduced themselves with their pronouns during class or group introductions. I graduated earlier this year and was also heavily involved in oSTEM during that time, but even my trans friends who werent in oSTEM felt pretty good about the support they got from their professors/friends. Of course like most schools not everyone will be respectful, but I definitely never felt unsafe. Institutional support is totally growing, you can choose your pronouns in places like canvas, and you are now able to change your name in most places. There is still a lot of work to do but Mines DI&amp;A is currently aware of those issues, and along with oSTEM is working on changing those. If you want to chat to some grad students who are at Mines currently shoot me a DM and I can get you the discord link for oSTEM, where you can maybe get some more opinions. Overall, I personally felt pretty safe and honestly pretty supported, but I did choose to surround myself with other LGBTQ+ people, which could have heavily impacted that. In chatting with my friends at other schools, it doesnt seem like we are considerably worse than other schools or their STEM departments in term of support. Feel free to also shoot me a DM if you have any more questions about being nb or queer at Mines, i\u2019d love to chat about it!",

I\u2019m a scientist first and foremost, but I would like to be in a community where my personhood is also valued. I am looking to be challenged academically, however I\u2019m not looking to justify or normalize who I am constantly. Given the current rise of homophobia and transphobia across the county, the general indifference on campus also makes me worry, as science does not happen in a vacuum (politically/socially). This has given me a lot to think about moving forward. Thank you again.",

It\u2019s a great school that\u2019ll give you a good education, but no matter who you are, it\u2019ll leave you feeling lonely often. Some people really dig that, though. A lot of folks fulfill their social needs beyond school and the quiet campus isn\u2019t much of an issue. Others, though, really struggle with it. Scroll through the threads in this sub an you\u2019ll see just how opinions of the school vary from person to person.\n\nI personally left Mines to pursue my degree elsewhere for different reasons (the CS program at mines is still bad and I found a better opportunity), but during my time at mines, I definitely experienced enough to understand why Mines is likable and why it\u2019s not. If an LGBT presence is really important to you, consider mulling your other options. If you just want to make sure you\u2019ll be safe, then there\u2019s nothing to worry about.

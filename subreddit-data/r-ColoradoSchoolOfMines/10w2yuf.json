    "postText": "I\u2019m graduating this fall with a degree in mechanical engineering. Got a job offer as a systems engineer. I\u2019ve been hearing that you should always start your career within your major and work outside of that if you don\u2019t like it. System engineering seems better than the normal day-to-day CAD that I see a lot of graduated meche students do, but I really have no idea. So, I have a couple questions for those with industry experience:\n\nIs it a bad idea to be a systems engineer right out of college?\nShould I be trying to get a (specifically) mechanical engineer job?\nAny other thoughts or opinions are appreciated. Thanks!",

The work inside your major thing is dumb, but it can affect you if you think you \\*could\\* want to go into HVAC or other design items. But if systems is your jam, it's still work experience. I would go for it if it interests you!",

Most places dont view it as something negative to be an engineer of a certain type with systems experience, in fact some employers and hiring managers might see that as a big benefit. Systems engineering gives great exposure to the overall process of building stuff, from beginning to end, which can make any other disciplines life easier and vice versa.",

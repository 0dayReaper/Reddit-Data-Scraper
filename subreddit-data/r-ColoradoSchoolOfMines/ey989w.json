Because I do! \n\nSeriously when they cancelled classes before Thanksgiving break I about did a double take. Getting them to cancel for weather is like pulling teeth. They hate doing it. And I\u2019ve been in and out of here for years and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen them ever move that early ever.\n\nHonestly when I got the text I was confused since I live 10 minutes from Campus and the snow hadn\u2019t started yet. So I was like \u2018What Ice?\u2019",

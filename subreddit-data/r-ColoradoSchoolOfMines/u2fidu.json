    "postText": "Really small question, and I don\u2019t think this deserves its own post, but I wanted to know if Calculus 1 at Mines expects me to know limits. I have already learned some of it in precalc (such as finding them graphically), but it was more of a precursor or intro. I was wondering if I should really hammer it out over the summer with stuff from khan academy/etc or I\u2019d be fine with the basic knowledge I have?",

            "comment": "They say Calc 1 is designed to be able to be passed by someone who\u2019s never taken Calculus before, you can\u2019t assume all students to come into Mines having taken Calculus before since it\u2019s not a standard HS class in many places, but it is very helpful to have some preexisting knowledge of calculus in general. In my case, I took both Calc 1 and Calc 2 before Mines, then proceeded to take Calc 1 again here and just knowing on a basic level what was being introduced beforehand was very helpful. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I felt like Calc 1 was lacking in a lot of the introduction of topics and fundamentals, kind of assuming you already knew what was going on and focusing more on practice of concepts despite what they say. It may have just been my professor, though. I\u2019m sure it varies across the department. I still knew people who had never taken Calculus before and did better than I did on tests. There\u2019s no reason to try and learn it all yourself if you\u2019re still going to be sitting in the class next fall and you\u2019re already ahead because you\u2019ve had some pre-calc anyway. If you\u2019re that confused on the concepts when they come up in class, you\u2019re probably better off learning it with campus resources than by yourself before you\u2019ve even been taught it.",

I got down most of it though (I memorized the unit circle, Pythagorean identities, double angle, supplement, and negative angles), is there any more that you know is used in Calculus at mines?",

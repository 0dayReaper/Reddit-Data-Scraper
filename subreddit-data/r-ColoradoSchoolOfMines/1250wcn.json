    "postText": "I'm applying for the master's program, non-thesis, for mechanical engineering (biomechanics), and I'm having mixed feelings about my personal statement.\nI get the vibe that the program is pretty chill, so I didn't try to be super formal. Polished, but personable. A couple of my friends read it for me and feel like it isn't professional enough, but they're in science PhD programs at fancy schools. \nThoughts from anyone in grad programs, particularly in ME?",

I'd say error on the side of having it be professional/polished but you still can be personable throughout. I wouldn't make it 100% personable on that note however as the idea is you're trying to say why you would be a good fit for the program and describe your character that may get a good number of applicants.",

To the point where I'm confused how I got in and am lucky to have been accepted. I hope that sounds at least a little reassuring. I'd say the most important thing is don't rush it and you will be fine. Go with your intuition as long as you're sure about it. Good luck!",

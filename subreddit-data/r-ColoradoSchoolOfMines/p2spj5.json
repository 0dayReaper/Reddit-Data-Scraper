    "postText": "Hello everyone. I was wondering what type of laptop I should buy as a ME student? What type of specs should they have? I was originally planning to buy the xps 17 with 16 gb ram, 512 gb ssd, i7 processor, and GTX 1650 graphics but someone online said that the graphics are not good for solidworks. Any help would be great, thank you.",

In computation-heavy classes you'll be in a computer lab anyway.\n\nIf you need to work off-campus, you can also remote in to the computer labs.\n\nEdit: especially with a laptop, since they aren't very cost-effective for performance.",

Solidworks ran just fine on my 7 year old potato laptop without dedicated graphics. \n\nAs others have said, if you need something more, you can always go to a computer lab.",

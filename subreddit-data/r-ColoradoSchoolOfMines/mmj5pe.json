    "postText": "I feel like this is a serious problem of mine that I don't know what to do about. Since remote learning began, I've had an incredibly hard time focusing, and it has gotten to the point where I barely pay attention in class and my participation in the class in general is negligible. I'm ill-prepared for nearly every exam, and my work is just low-quality, and I don't know the material. I *know* that I'm self-sabotaging, but I feel like I can't do anything about it. Like a lack of self-control.\n\nThis is only my freshman year, and I'm already panicking and thinking of what's going to happen to me if this continues. Almost certainly dropping out. I was on track to graduate early, and now I worry I have jeopardized my chances and my GPA.\n\nIt just feels really hopeless, so I'm just wondering if anyone has been in a similar position and has any advice to offer me. Things just feel bleak. Thanks \u270c",

I did pretty poorly my first two years in college, at a different school that is similar to Mines, and now I have a MS and am well on my way to earning a PhD in Engineering.   \n\n\nYou have the added challenge of COVID and remote learning which is extra hard on the hands-on heavy kind of majors that most Mines students are in. COVID has affected us all negatively, but there is light at the end of tunnel.  \n\n\nThe three biggest pieces of advice I can give you are:  \n\n\n* If you didn't have to study in high school. Schedule study time and learn how. Honestly that was my biggest challenge in the start of undergrad\n* Take time out for yourself. You may be overwhelmed with work, and it will at times be tempting to push through for weeks straight. Don't. Chronic overwork can be as harmful to productivity as laziness. Find a way to have free time. Maybe it is a couple hours every day; Maybe you need to hold Saturdays sacred; Maybe a 30minute walk when you get stressed will be enough. The important thing is to makes sure you get something to look forward to and recuperation time. Only sacrifice this during crunch time and if there is no other way to complete your tasks.\n* Learn from failure and move on. Don't dwell, and don't let it discourage you too much. You've got this.",

Like Ihamapotato said, breaking things down into less scary chunks helps a lot. Also make sure you give yourself breaks. Studying for 30-45 mins then taking a 5 min breather. Coming back to the material, maybe study a little bit longer, then take a 10 min breather. Keep going from there. Maybe give that a try and it can help. You can do this. We can do this. Just gotta keep telling ourselves that.",

There is not one person at this school that can say that they haven't struggled, felt like they weren't good enough, failed a class, etc. I went through that myself; I had to withdraw from Phys 1 my first time around and have had many extremely borderline-failing grades. What defines you as a student isn't how hard you've bombed your classes or how little you are getting things, but how you are bouncing back from it all. I'm a Junior right now, and I can say for sure that Freshman year is ruthless; they throw all these random classes at you that have nothing to do with your major in order to weed people out. Once you get over that hump, I wouldn't say it's smooth sailing, but you will be doing classes that you want to do and that you feel excited for. Hang in there, talk to your professors, your RA, or utilize the counseling center, but just know that you aren't alone in feeling this way.",

It feels like I have no reason to be struggling, since I was immediately thrust into classes that I *should* be enjoying, but because of my struggles it feels like I can't. I don't think professors would understand - there's just a valley that I don't think can really be bridged there - but I'll consider talking to my RA or maybe the counseling center. I just need to finish this semester and take what I can get, then worry about fixing whatever damage has been done. Thanks for your reply :)",

I notice I am a lot more productive if there's no bed or TV near by, and I have an easier time relaxing and sleeping at home if I know that once I walk back to my room I'm done working for the day.\n\nEdit: Also keep in mind we have the grade replacement policy now! That's really helping me from not feeling like a complete failure, knowing that I can at least bring up my GPA this summer when I retake some of the classes I failed last semester.",

I'm really glad they implemented that, the stress would be so much higher without it. It might set me a semester back from graduating (I was set to be done in just 5 semesters) but it would be worth it. \n\nGood idea moving around and doing work elsewhere - I've tried that a lot this year, and I guess it's just annoying that I have to wear the stupid mask, haha.

Like, calling my mom at midnight with an anxious breakdown. I too thought I was set with graduating early and transferring in all the \"weed out\" classes. Wasn't expecting a cakewalk, but I got knocked onto my ass. Adjusting to college was difficult, and during COVID I can only imagine it's harder.\n\nMaybe there's like five people at Mines who think it's a breeze, but from what I can tell everyone else is paddling like hell to stay afloat to some degree. I knew three people with full rides that got curb stomped and dropped out. While I can't speak for everyone, it did get easier. I found a groove and have been able to raise my GPA by 0.6.\n\nI think everyone else has covered the general and practical advice. Change doesn't happen overnight, but commit to those increments and you'll find a groove as well. My advice is to be patient with yourself, and don't make yourself miserable. Life already beats you enough, no need to assist. \n\nDM me if you ever want to get food or hit the gym :)",

            "comment": "You are absolutely not alone. I am in my third year at Mines and am feeling the exact way you described for the first time this semester. When you're attending a normal semester, all the students around you are studying, you constantly are talking about the work you are doing with your friends and colleagues, and a much larger portion of your time is spent in productivity-focused spaces.\n\nNow I mostly sit in my room at my computer. It genuinely feels impossible to do work sometimes, but this is also a symptom of ADHD which I have. I already struggle with productivity, and the personal reason I go to a school to learn computer science instead of self-learning is because the setting and structure helps me actually complete learning objectives. Now the setting and much of the structure is gone. Cool stuff.\n\nThis is somewhat also a personal note to myself: Yeah, you might be in a hole at the moment. So what? What are you gonna do about it *right now*? Like actually right now, right now. Write down what the problem is and what steps you are going to take to fix it. Create the structure you require. Go to school buildings if you need to do work, even if you don't \"need\" to be there. Make plans. Follow through. If you start feeling things slipping through your fingers again, remember this and the feeling it gives you. You are the only one that is responsible for you. You control you. No one else.\n\nYou got this, good luck  \ud83d\udc4d",

            "comment": "I felt very much the same way my Freshman year. I called my parents multiple times talking about dropping out. That summer I went with a student ministry on an extended trip, and I was struck by how much the people I was around cared for me and loved me. I had never experienced that from peers before. \n\nAfter starting a relationship with Jesus and surrendering my plan to him, I began to learn that my value wasn't rooted in my performance or my grades. It was rooted in the fact that I had a creator who loved me unconditionally. That idea has been life changing for me at Mines! Ironically, my grades have improved, along with my mental health and well being. By no means has it been a cakewalk, but walking with Jesus at has motivated me to invest in what really matters: relationships with people. \n\nI know all that sounds hokey, but it's how I feel. Here is some general advice I can give as a senior about to graduate:\n\n- You're in a different pond now! This school is full of incredibly smart people, so your perception of acceptable grades from high school should change! Challenge yourself, but realize that just being here puts you in an elite class!\n\n- Focus on relationships. If you're struggling a lot with an assignment, take a break and grab lunch with someone. Anyone. You'll feel better!\n\n- Office hours are key. Teachers/TAs like you more if you go, and you get one-on-one learning time.\n\n- I'm in a fraternity, and I've found the relationship value there to be extremely helpful. Greek life might not be for everyone, but join something!\n\nThanks for coming to my TED Talk. DM me if you want to grab lunch sometime!",

Incidentally, I've recently had a spiritual awakening myself - last year was a big step forward for my relationship with Christ, and I feel like I'm doing better in that department than ever. I should try better to give this anxiety and terrible feelings up to Him and go from there instead. Maybe I wallow in my own feelings too much instead of just giving them up to God and trusting in His plan for me. It's definitely not just coincidence that your grades and mental health improved after that - a close relationship with Christ seriously changes everything.\n\nThe social aspect is definitely a big player here, and I agree with you on developing relationships, something I've definitely struggled with (especially with remote learning). I think I'll take your advice and go out and do something with people today, and come back to my work with a new mindset. I don't think Greek life is for me, but I should try to be more social in general and more active in the campus community. I appreciate your message greatly, so thanks for taking the time to write it up. God bless!",

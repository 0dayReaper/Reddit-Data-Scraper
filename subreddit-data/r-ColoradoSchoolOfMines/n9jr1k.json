    "postText": "Hi all, I am an incoming freshman and was wondering if it is worth it to take econ 201 and 202 at Red Rock CC or just suck it up and take it at Mines? The counselors haven\u2019t been clear if it\u2019s actually helpful or not to have it out of the way, thx\n\nedit: Can\u2019t take it this year bc I would risk losing scholarships by being a \u201ctransfer\u201d student since I\u2019m not technically enrolled at Mines yet. (kinda a scam)",

It's a transfer credit so you don't need to try to get a good grade so long as you pass. \n\n Taking econ at Mines just doesn't matter unless you're getting an econ degree.",

I emailed the summer prof asking about the workload for the class for the summer and she said to expect 20 hours a week... NOPE. I took 12 hrs last summer (6 per session) and don't think I spent that much time on them. So I just registered for 201 and 202 at RR for this summer.",

I had lafrancois for Econ last year and I didn\u2019t think it was too bad, but probably would be less painful taking it online at RR",

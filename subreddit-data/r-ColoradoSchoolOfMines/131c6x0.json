            "comment": "You should stay in Golden if you\u2019re a freshman. If public transit is a must, there are bus routes that run up and down old golden road (to the south of campus). So finding an apartment along that route would be ideal. There\u2019s also a light rail, the W line, that goes in and out of Golden and students get free rides on the light rail and bus, however you\u2019re still a ways from campus when the light rail stops. Google that route and look for apartments at those stops.  Personally I would try to live close to campus if possible, or consider biking to campus.",

The university has also promised to add a bus line that goes down south Golden rd, but I'm not sure how far down. So anything reasonably close to south golden road should be fine and depending on how long of a commute you want anything along the W line could also work.",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve talked to an international student who lives in Mines Park, Mines might put you together with other international students there? It\u2019s close to campus and isn\u2019t too expensive for apartment/condo living in Golden. You\u2019d have to email residence life to ask more about that, though. \n\nWhen you factor in highways, traffic, snow, etc., living 30 minutes from campus can be closer to an hour for your commute. Also, I\u2019m guessing you won\u2019t have a car, and public transport can be unreliable (the W Line light rail had an issue and wasn\u2019t servicing Golden for a bit), so you\u2019ll probably want to live close to campus to be able to walk or only have one bus ride to make. \n\nIf you have Facebook, join the group called Mines List where people post apartments, houses, and rooms for rent near Mines.",

Mines should be providing housing if you\u2019re coming to study abroad. If you\u2019re just an international student who\u2019s enrolling at Mines for your degree you have to find your own housing like the rest of us.",

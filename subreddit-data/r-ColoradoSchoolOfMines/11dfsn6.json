    "postText": "Long story short, Im a junior who still hasn\u2019t completed econ 201 and csci 101 and I really don\u2019t want to take these at Mines. I know there\u2019s some preapproved transfers at Red Rocks, but I don\u2019t really have a free semester to take them before I graduate. I have field camp for the beginning of the summer, then an internship for the second half and then the fall semester starts. \n\nWould it be a bad idea to take these two classes during the summer or fall semester? I don\u2019t know how much of the classes are flexible to complete on my own time, or how much the workload is. I\u2019d hopefully be a fully online student for Red Rocks. The fall semester should be somewhat light, probably 12-15 credits. \n\nAny advice from someone who\u2019s done this or taken these specific classes at Red Rocks is appreciated!",

I remember econ 101 being pretty easy, it was during COVID and was remote. I can't vouch for CSCI 101 as I did not take it there, but I do regret not taking it.",

Total I was taking 4 classes (12 credits) there while working 40+ hours/week and thought the workload wasn't too bad. Almost all of the classes I took gave about a week to complete an assignment before due, so you have some freedom in terms of when you do homework, but you still have to follow the general pace of the class.\n\nRegarding making sure your classes transfer, check the CCCS transfer list at mines and you'll be set. When you're registering for classes, I'd also try to do the CCCS sections instead of the RRCC-online sections just to make sure your transfer is absolutely bulletproof as well.",

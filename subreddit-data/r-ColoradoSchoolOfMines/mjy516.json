It\u2019s 2 hours south of Golden but I\u2019d rather spend 4 hours in the car than 40+ hours in quarantine.\n\nIf you type in the zip code 81212 as your current location for the Walmart store locator there are still plenty of appointments left in the early morning. I got one at 7am so my plan is leave at 5am, get there at 7, and hopefully get back around 9:15 for my 9:30 class. If anyone else has a similar schedule and wants to join, there are still appointments at 7am, so we could carpool and get vaccinated at the same time.\n\nWith the extremely high demand right now it seems like it\u2019ll probably be at least another few weeks before mines is able to offer students any kind of on campus vaccine, and with E-days coming up I just wanted to throw this out there.",

There are also some in Pueblo but that's a but further.\n\n(As a side note, if anyone is wanting to get in on the Fauci Ouchie but doesn't have a car, I'm scheduled for 3:15 on the 12th and am totally willing to pick folks up to carpool - feel free to dm me)",

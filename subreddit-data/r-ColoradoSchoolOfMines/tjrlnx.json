    "postText": "I have heard that Mines is only really great for petroleum or mining or metallurgical engineering. I got accepted and am planning to study mechanical engineering, so I was wondering what everyone's thought on this is.\n\nAdditionally, I found this on a Mines post:\n\n\" Mines has project based classes, but they aren't great. Design 1 &amp;2 which everyone has to take are a bit of a joke. The clubs and orgs are separate and your own thing. They really rely on leadership and people with the time and motivation to make things happen.\"\n\nCan someone please elaborate on this more if they feel similar?",

As others have said Mines is 'world class' for the extraction engineering majors - but still highly regarded and respected for everything else. I studied Chemical with a minor in CS and got a CS job. People are still very impressed with Mines on the Resume - even though I'm not working in my field of study and that major was not 'one of the best' at Mines.\n\nBut also - in the end an engineering degree is an engineering degree and they're always in short supply - so you can't really go wrong. You can just be well off or really well off.",

            "comment": "Sure, I'm a MechE major. Put plainly, Mines is *world class* in the extraction majors, but \"only\" good/great in the others. This comment is most relevant in discussions of OOS admissions into non-extraction majors, in which case Mines usually isn't worth the OOS tuition vs whatever your top state school is. So for MechE, Mines would be comparable to CU Boulder/UW Madison/UMD CP/ UW-Seattle/etc. For the extraction majors, the comparable schools are, like, MIT and Georgia Tech. Get what I mean?\n\nProject-based classes are what you make of them. This won't be different from one school to another, it's just that Mines seems to have more of them than you'd expect. Personally, class projects are a big part of my early career strategy, so I've mostly chosen to do relatively serious projects that look good on my resume, and it's served me well in getting interships. I think there are downsides to Mines (like any school) that you should consider when making a decision, but the project-based classes shouldn't be one of them.",

His attitude totally spiked. I got a second interview in person with the engineers, then a third interview with the region exec. As my graduation is end of summer not May, they said to email monthly and before taking another position. \nBecause of my senior design video. If it gets you a job, it isn\u2019t bad.",

I got accepted and am planning to study mechanical engineering, so I was wondering what everyone's thought on this is.\n\nIt's not only those three.  Those are just the ones where Mines is the best in the world or close to it, but lots of other programs are excellent.  For example, I know the civil program is well-regarded (not *as* good as mining etc), and the water resources faculty are superb.  Likewise, I think, for underground construction and tunneling.\n\nI have no idea how mechanical engineering is, though.",

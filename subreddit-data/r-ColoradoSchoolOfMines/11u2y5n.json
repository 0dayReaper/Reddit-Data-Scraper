Are we talking taste like horse shit but is edible or is made from such shitty ingredients that you can get sick or just feel awful after eating it.",

You can absolutely tell it\u2019s dining hall food, but I\u2019ve had worse. I think the worst part is how repetitive it would get.",

If you\u2019re a sandwich fan, you can pretty much always get one and they\u2019re consistently good ingredients.\n\nAs long as you don\u2019t have dietary restrictions, you\u2019ll always be able to find something to eat.\n\nThe worst part about it is just how much it costs. $3500 for 14 swipes per week per semester is just insane. That\u2019s what I\u2019m most pissed about.",

I have no idea what company Mines uses nowadays, but I can't imagine it being worse than Aramark. At least the students have fast food options (that are reliable) like Qdoba.",

I personally had issues with the food the entirety of my freshman year because they are low quality and often times make me feel sick/sluggish if it was the wrong food choice. I don\u2019t think think I could ever eat from Wow Cafe again, their food in particular was detrimental to my gut health any time I ate it. The food on campus is edible and tastes pretty okay, but if you are used to healthier eating and home cooking get prepared for a sharp decline.",

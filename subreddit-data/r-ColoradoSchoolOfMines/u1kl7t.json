So far the only things that have been assigned is a 3 page paper about a glass blowing technique or person and a 2 question quiz about an article. The \u2018lecture\u2019 portion of it is a few minutes going over either a topic or news about the glass class, then you head down to the hot shop to watch a demo in what you\u2019ll be doing that week. The lab portion is you working in the hot shop the whole time with 1-2 other classmates and a TA. Overall it\u2019s a really fun class and a good break from other classes.",

    "postText": "I've been accepted to continue at Mines for a Master's after completing my Bachelor's. I was under the impression I could take whatever electives I wanted the same way I did for my undergrad degree. I was planning to take classes from the department I did my minor in, which isn't really relevant to my major. How hard is it to have your electives approved? What is the process for making a case that the electives are appropriate for your degree?",

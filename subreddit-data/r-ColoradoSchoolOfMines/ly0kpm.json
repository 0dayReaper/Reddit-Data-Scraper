Most people in the work force encouraged it since money is an issue for me, and its the same education in a few less years. I\u2019ll only be 20 when i graduate with the undergrad and 21 with the Masters. My computer science teacher from hs did the same thing and she said it actually looked better for her when applying for jobs.",

Jechura likes English units and emphasizes process safety in things. Wu and Gomez have weird handwriting. Gardner is fond of \"make up your own problems\" for fluids. And so it goes on and on\n\nSenior year (in which I am now) is adjusting to how stupid my exams and classes are. Granted, it's all remote so I can't interrupt the professor non stop. Ever since COVID started, collaborating on assignments has been the norm for most of us, and not being allowed (formally allowed) to do so on exams is very difficult. Open note/book/google doesn't really apply to niche topics like process (you can't just google how to make the entire model of a system in 5 minutes). Also timing is a big issue, I think we need more time for exams.\n\n\n\nThe hardest part about balancing it is knowing that because of circumstance, getting a job/internship is difficult. I've gone to career fair every time for 3 years and have only gotten 1 interview. I've applied online, but my lack of internships (ironic, to get an internship, i need to have already had experience) has prevented me from really getting one",

I only brought in 28 credits (a little under whats considered a full year at Mines) so I had some heavy semesters (took 19.5 credits one semester). The biggest advice I can give though is to plan out your classes early. I planned my whole schedule my freshman year and confirmed it with my advisor to iron out any issues early. You don't want to end up missing prerequisites later on delaying your graduation.",

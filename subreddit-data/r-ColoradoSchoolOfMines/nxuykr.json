    "postText": "I am moving to CO this summer to complete my degree at Mines and I am looking for a roommate to share a 2bd. I am an older student who has a 60 lb super friendly dog. I do not have a place yet, but hopefully will be finding one soon. Trying to keep rent at $600-$800 per room ($1200-$1600 for apartment) in the Lakewood/Arvada/Golden/Denver area. Please DM me if you or someone you know is looking. Doesn't have to be a student. Don't have any restrictions except dog-friendly. Thank you!",

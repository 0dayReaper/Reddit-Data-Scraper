            "comment": "I took 536 in Fall of 2020 with Dr. Williams. The focus is less on math concepts and more on how human interaction with robots takes place. The main language is Python - you'll be working all semester with a Nao robot to study human/robot interactions and what factors affect it. In addition, it is more essay-heavy than your typical CSCI class.",

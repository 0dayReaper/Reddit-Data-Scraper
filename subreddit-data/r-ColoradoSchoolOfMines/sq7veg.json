It's based in Java, and the class in a flipped style, meaning you watch pre-recorded lectures on new topics before applying them when coming to class. Since CSCI262 is a pre-req, the pre-recorded videos make a lot of connections to C++. We have in class pop quizzes that can sometimes be challenging, so I'd recommend really studying the pre-recorded lectures before class. Though the quizzes are only worth 10%. I'd recommend finding your partner early since you'd be more likely to find a proactive type of person!",

It's based in Java and does a decent job teaching the language, but it has some quirks if you're not used to it. The final project is a free &gt;90% if you put some effort it, and there's no final exam.",

I wouldn't say the food is great but you are also able to communicate with the dining hall staff to have your food made separately idk if celiac would fall under the conditions needed for that but there is always a gluten free choice.",

We were looking on find me gluten free and their ratings were too good to be true so we went in and had an absolute amazing experience. Gluten free pizza was great and they have a dedicated fryer too! Their hot wings were great. \n\nWe\u2019ve had positive experiences at the bridge water grill, the wine bar in town, and not to mention Holidaily brewery down the road which is a completely dedicated gluten free brewery with beers that taste just as good as any other. These aren\u2019t specific to the university, but feel free to DM me if you have more questions about Golden",

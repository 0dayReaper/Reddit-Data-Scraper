    "postText": "Could you share where Mines students tend to look for off-campus housing options? Craigslist? Is there an \"off-campus housing assistance\" office? I have a property coming up for rent nearby in Wheat Ridge and would love to work with Mines students if possible. Could be much more affordable than what seems available in Golden at the moment.\n\nI have a 2 bedroom, 1 bath, 1 detached bonus room (remote work space, workshop, etc) and single car garage, in the 38th and Kipling area.\u00a0\n\nPet friendly with easy access to Sprouts, King Soopers, shopping, public transportation, and the Wheat Ridge green belt/clear creek trail. 10 minute commute to the Mines campus. \n\nPhotos will be available soon. Showings available Sunday from 10AM - 4PM and M-F, 6PM - 8:30PM the week of October 3rd.\n\nNovember 1st move-in date preferred, earlier options may be available. $2200 / month for qualified renters. No application fees. Utilities will be renter paid, water is covered. Please reply if you have any questions or would like additional information, or to schedule a time to see the property. Have a great week and Go Orediggers!\n\n[https://nextdoor.com/for\\_sale\\_and\\_free/b19a4961-75b0-41d1-b478-f6a923d16742?init\\_source=classified](https://nextdoor.com/for_sale_and_free/b19a4961-75b0-41d1-b478-f6a923d16742?init_source=classified)",

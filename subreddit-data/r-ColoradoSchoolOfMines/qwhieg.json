    "postText": "This is an odd situation to be in, but if I fail a co-requisite course (MATH213 is a coreq for PHGN200) but pass PHGN200, do I have to retake both courses, or just MATH213? I emailed an advisor but was hoping I might get a quicker response here, as I am pretty stressed about it. I plan on taking MATH213 again next semester either way, but I\u2019m hoping I don\u2019t have to retake PHGN200 as well.",

If you don't pass the co-requisite, you very likely can't take additional upper-level courses until you pass it (unless those courses also allow it as a co-requisite)",

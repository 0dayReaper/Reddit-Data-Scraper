    "postText": "I'm suffering from a horrible stomach flu and I doubt I will be able to make it to my exam tomorrow morning. I know about the excused absence form right here\n\n[https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?COSchoolofMines&amp;layout\\_id=7](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?COSchoolofMines&amp;layout_id=7)\n\nbut it says to submit it after I come back to school. I don't know whether or not it is proper etiquette to email my professor or anyone else about it beforehand. It also asks for proof and I can't get a doctor's note because I'm too sick walk to leave my apartment. If anyone knows the answers to these questions, I would be very grateful.",

Even when I had to miss school for a funeral, I had to submit \"proof\" (thankfully they accepted the message I got saying they passed away)\n\nIf you have a fever, maybe just submit a picture of that? Usually if the professor will just reschedule you for a different time, but some professors can be..... not great. I would recommend just emailing your professor about your situation and also submitting the absence form just to be safe. Good luck, hopefully it works out and you feel better soon!",

I submitted that form before the exam and emailed my prof after they've got the notification from school that I was absent that day and would like to make up the exam next week. It's usually a pretty fast response, same day, or the day after but since it's the weekend I don't know if your professor would get notified by the school that you're excused. I would suggest emailing your professor first and telling them that you submitted an excused absence form, also don't forget to mention that you don't have a doctor's note.",

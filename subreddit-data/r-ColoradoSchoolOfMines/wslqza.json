    "postText": "Hello,\n\nHas anyone taken CSCI 303 ( INTRODUCTION TO DATA SCIENCE ). I am not very keen on taking any compsi classes here so I've taken transfers at ACC. However I did take CSCI 261 and part of 262 here. Can someone tell me what I should expect, like project wise and content wise. I did find an old page with a syllabus from 2018. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Is is similar in exam and project style and do y'all have an good resources to keep up in the class. (I just detest compsi ;-; ) Thanks a bunch!",

There is a research project but just follow the rubric and you\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s a pretty easy course imo. There are no exams but there are 3 final quizzes but they are open note and are similar in content to the projects.",

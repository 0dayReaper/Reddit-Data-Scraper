    "postText": "i\u2019m a graduating high school senior and strongly considering mines. i like the idea of being a paleontologist, which usually requires a geoscience or bio undergrad degree in order to get into a grad program. i\u2019m accepted into mines for geological engineering, which i understand to be different than being a geology major. will this still allow me to get into a paleontology grad program later?",

Would go to a school with Paleo faculty so you can do undergrad research in Paleo. Also a school with a more general Bio Dept. would be better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut yes, if you do well at Mines, you should be able to get into Paleo grad school.",

Not an expert by any means in paleontology or that field, but if you\u2019re dead set on being a paleontologist I\u2019d think about looking somewhere else. Mines is first and foremost an engineering school, and things like fossils are only talked about briefly in the entry class and a junior-level sediment class. Not saying it\u2019s impossible to go here and become a paleontologist, but this major in my experience is predominantly for mineral and petroleum exploration people and geotech people.",

Also target research and fieldwork projects for undergrads that are related to palaeontology or show transferable skills to it.",

            "comment": "I graduated over 5 years ago so might be slightly different but he's the general difference.\n\nGeology was split into engineering geology, and exploration geology. Engineering geology is more like civil engineering. Exploration geology is more like geophysics and structural geology, with a clear channel into mining or petroleum, or other more sciency sectors. \n\nI did engineering geo and so now I'm a geotech / geological engineer working in construction. I had several friends who did exploration, some got mapping jobs for mining companies, one guy went into volcanoes by way of geophysics, others went into oil &amp; gas by way of geophysics.",

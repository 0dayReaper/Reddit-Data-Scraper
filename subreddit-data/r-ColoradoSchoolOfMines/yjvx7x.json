Ofc you'll need to code as well but I definitely felt like communication was the main takeaway. Depending on your group and your project, you'll work very different amount of hours per day/week; so I would recommend either picking a project you're genuinely interested in or an easy one",

I've done the hat trick on the field session (student, client, and advisor).\n\nYour experience will depend on the client, but in general, they're all fine to work with. Some projects may appear to be more aspirational, but the client should make it clear what they're hoping for versus expecting.\n\nBiggest challenges I've seen:\n\n* Clients that aren't willing to put in the hours required to help get a team of students started on their project\n* Student groups forgetting how little time they have to get the project/product done to deliver to the client\n\nThe rest of the work \u2014 presentations, documents, etc \u2014 are all very doable, but it is something you have to be actively thinking about.\n\nHonestly, being present and responsive to your team is about 95% of what you need to do to be successful with the CS field session.",

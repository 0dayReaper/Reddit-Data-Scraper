I don't know if you have a car, but parking in the garage isn't a guarantee (and even if it is, the security is still pretty shit and break-ins still happen a decent amount of the time). Even during its first year open we didn't have access to hardly anything and they still charged us a small fortune.\n\nIf you have people you really want to move in with who also want to go Jackson, it's maybe worth a consideration, but the \"amenities\" and the location are the only two factors that would maybe make it a real option.\n\nOtherwise just rent somewhere else.",

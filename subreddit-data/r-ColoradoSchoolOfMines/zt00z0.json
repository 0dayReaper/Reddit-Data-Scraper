I'd be hard pressed to name a reasonable number of favorites, but Holley, Kinzli, Panos, Anderson (civil), Singha, Marshall, Shorey (geology), and Nychka (AMS) are all great at teaching.\n\nAdvanced surveying (taught by Holley) is a strong contender for the best class I took as an undergrad. As a grad student, the new hydrometeorology special topics (Anderson) was excellent, and watershed modeling is changing hands (will be Anderson) but it was historically great (both cross-listed for undergrads). Marshall also did a great job with surface water, which is apparently a dramatic shift from its previous iteration. I'm going to stop here before I list out my entire MS curriculum. I like the civil/water resources/hydrology coursework and faculty here as a rule.",

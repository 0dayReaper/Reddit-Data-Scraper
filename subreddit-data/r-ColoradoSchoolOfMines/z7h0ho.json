Especially in the bathrooms if you look under any crevice or hard to reach area it\u2019s just covered in nasty stuff and I did not have a good experience with them cleaning the rooms before I moved in. Then again housing in golden is expensive in general so idk how it compares\n\nAnd while I don\u2019t think they will match you with co-ed roommates, if you choose your roommates they don\u2019t stop you",

The rooms feel a bit old but if anything breaks you just do a work order and they fix it next day. And they shovel all the snow for you. Views are great and you can bike or mtb up lookout whenever as a workout. Only downside is nowhere to plug in an EV and the roommate assignments are terrible. Make sure to room with someone you know or they\u2019ll move someone in randomly who\u2019s not a good match.",

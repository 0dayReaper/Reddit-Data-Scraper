    "postText": "Hey there! I would extremely appreciate if everyone reading this can give me some advice on this. I have a full ride to any college in the U.S and Mines was my first option. Do you believe the difficulty at Mines is worth getting a bachelors or masters in terms of making money? Or do you suggest I should look at other colleges that are \u201ceasier\u201d but might pay similar amounts. In all honesty, I\u2019m not sure how much Mines would affect my overall salary in the future as opposed if I majored the same career in a different college. I was also wondering what would be considered the \u201cbest\u201d career at Mines in terms of money, effort, popularity, etc. Please let me know. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Supposedly mines grads makes more money on average, but i have a feeling that's skewed because other schools' salary reports are dragged down by non engineering majors. To be honest I don't think it makes a difference. It's an engineering school. If you do well in engineering you'll probably make a lot of money. The most important thing is to know that you can always negotiate, and jumping jobs at the right moment will give you a 10-15% bump over staying at your current company year after year. \n\nFor my own personal stats, I started out at 78k base in 2018. Now I'm at 147k base. I've jumped jobs 4 times. I was EE.",

This is something you can\u2019t really get at any other school.\n\nCS is easily the most popular major rn followed by mech E its up to you on what you want to study though and if you get with your counselor early, they can help you figure that out. \n\nMines is highly regarded in the industry from my experience. And the school makes a good job at Career fairs with over 200 employers at each one. (There are two each school year)",

I transferred to Mines *for* a challenge, and that was definitely the right call for me, even with no financial payoff. Building a really rigorous understanding of the subject matter can be worthwhile and fulfilling in its own right.",

            "comment": "A big part of the trick with these high-powered schools is: Much of the benefit comes from the school's *reputation*. I've told people I went to CSM and they reply with something along the lines of \"Wow, that's a tough school\" and immediately earned brownie points with them. I've also talked to people that have never heard of it. To that second group, I'm on equal footing with any other physics graduate. CSM has a great reputation, but that reputation is far more regional than a school like MIT or Cal Tech.\n\nSo, to maximize the benefit of going to a school like CSM, you need to look for jobs in areas that know about the school. This is mostly the Rocky Mountain and West Coast area, with a side of Southern Oil states. Do you have an idea what sort of companies you'd want to work for? Are those companies present in the American West? Do you want to/are you able to live there post-graduation?",

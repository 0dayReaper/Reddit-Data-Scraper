I\u2019m assuming though that anything super intense could be run on a campus desktop somewhere throughout the school. Not to say tho that a SP8 couldn\u2019t run cad, it most definitely can.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a device to draw on, can\u2019t really get a better one than a surface. My SLS uses the same pen as the 8, and I really like it over other systems that don\u2019t have pen haptics. Only downside I see is that they\u2019re pretty spendy\u2026 which I got around by buying my laptop \u201cused\u201d (open box without the box, barely used at all).\n\nAll in all, I think you\u2019ll be fine with and enjoy the pro 8",

            "comment": "Look up all the software that is available to students through the Mines website. You can get a computer to handle all these programs but it\u2019s unnecessary. If you aren\u2019t in the honors program, you\u2019ll need to take Design I which uses Solidworks. Being able to move freely around campus to use it was great, but not necessary. There are labs around campus which you can get work done if you don\u2019t finish in class, so honestly get whatever you find to be the most comfortable. (However I would steer clear of Apple products because even though they\u2019re convenient they don\u2019t play nice.) You\u2019ll mostly need something that can have a ton of tabs open and run pop-up programs like Pearsons mastering programs. We use mastering for chem, calc, statics, and probably more. Sorry if this jumps everywhere, I\u2019m typing this on my phone in a rush \ud83d\ude02",

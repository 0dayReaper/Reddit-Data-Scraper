    "postText": "I have this weird question, back pre covid when I would interact with other humans I noticed a lot of people had a \"I'm here to make money not freinds\" attitude. And with the pandemic I've even noticed myself turning away freinds just so I could work my butt off to get a 50% on an exam. I don't like the person I've been becoming and now that I've actually noticed it happening, I try my best to change things. To un burn bridges and reconnect with freinds I lost touch with.\n\nI was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience or if I was just allways an asshole and it took this much pressure to bring it out of me?\n\nI realized that my group of freinds I used to have has burned down to just my gf and it doesn't feel healthy.\n\nEdit: if my freinds see this I do truly miss you guys and I'm really sorry.",

Most of us are just trying to survive now.  Morale is low.  It\u2019s hard to make a friend group rn because of everything going on.  \n\nI really hope the professors are seeing it right now.  I know they are undergoing their own stress. But I hope they can feel what we are going through right now and be lenient.",

            "comment": "I haven't actually met anyone with that attitude; I'm guessing it must be major-dependent or something.  To the extent it is present, I think it's probably just something that some engineering students have, since, as a transfer student, my first university was *way* worse.\n\nI think most of the social breakdown is from the pandemic.  It's hard to keep up friendships when you aren't regularly seeing people in class and stuff, since you have to go out of your way to maintain it, which can be difficult with engineering-student schedules.  I've had no difficulty with the friends I still share classes with, but I haven't really been in touch with the others since the pandemic started.",

            "comment": "I don't share this sentiment. I might not fully grasp the workload of other majors is, but as a CS major I've found that if I really want to, it's more than possible to do both social life and study. Your friends should be people that are easy to hang out with and study with. I've personally never met someone at Mines who had that \"I'm here to make money, not friends\" attitude. Why not both?\n\nMaybe you're reading people differently or are in a different major where the climate is different, but to have friends, you have to interact with people. That's what a friendship is. Make your interactions lower pressure/higher frequency. Discord is a good tool. A group of people around you that support you and make you feel appreciated is important. If you neglect to try to create that for yourself, Mines isn't turning you into a butt, you're turning you into a butt. This shit's hard right now for sure. Sounds like you want to solve that. Good luck!",

I used to have more friends and relationships that I let fall away due to school. I learned a lot at Mines and got a good degree but I'm not sure if it was worth it due to the other changes it caused in me.",

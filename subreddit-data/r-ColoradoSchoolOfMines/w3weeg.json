If you don\u2019t want to be like them or don\u2019t want to have responsibilities like them then maybe consider taking your career a different direction. I didn\u2019t pay attention to how much stress being a PE is and wish I had chosen a different path. I could have easily avoided this by observing how much stress and responsibility the more senior engineers had when I was an intern. Food for thought.",

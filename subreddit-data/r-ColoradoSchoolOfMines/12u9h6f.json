I know for some future courses you need a C or higher, but aside from that, what other implications occur?\n\nMaybe my question is, What does Mines view as a passing grade?\n\nAny help would be great!",

This could very well be true in other departments too.\n\nSource: Geo Department head read through all course scripture and nowhere does it mention needing a C- as a requirement. This seems to be a rumor formulated somewhere.\n\nJust a reminder for people to do their own research, or ask their department / course head to verify.",

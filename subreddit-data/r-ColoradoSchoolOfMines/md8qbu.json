My friend is taking this course which is a part of his major so it would be nice to do it with him. I have a lot of options for a math minor so I'm trying to decide whether I'd like this course or not. Any info would be helpful.",

Not a ton of projects and they were pretty simple. I'd only take it if you have to, you don't really learn much. It's a good way to meet the other math majors though.",

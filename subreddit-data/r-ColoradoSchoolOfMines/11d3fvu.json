    "postText": "Hi everyone, was just wondering if anyone has experience with taking online summer classes through Mines before. If so:\n\n\u2022 What are the hours like - do you meet virtually at set times or is it work at your own pace?\n\n\u2022 What is the workload like compared to taking a regular class on campus - is it manageable while still having time to relax/do other activities?\n\n\u2022 If you needed help from course faculty, did you feel like you received it sufficiently?\n\n\u2022 Did you feel like taking the online course was worth it?\n\nThank you for any responses!",

I think it was a 6 week session and even so I had tons of time to travel and do other things. It seemed a lot easier than NHV in a normal semester as some of the readings were cut out",

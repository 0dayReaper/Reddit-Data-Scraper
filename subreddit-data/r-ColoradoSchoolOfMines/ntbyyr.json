    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nI'm a transfer student moving from a small chemistry program at another four year school to CSM. I'm undecided as to whether I should go the ChemE or just the regular Chemistry route. I'll be transferring in as a junior.\n\nI was leaning toward ChemE for the versatility, employability, and comparatively larger major size. But I'm reading through a bunch of these subreddits and everyone seems to be saying ChemE is completely awful, unmanageable, and unnecessarily difficult. I'm concerned that I don't have the background to get through it with a decent GPA.\n\nI also suspect I'd enjoy chemistry more. Maybe that's a good enough reason to stick with my current major.\n\nAnyone in either of these programs have any advice or thoughts?",

That combo was really attractive to a lot of employers, I don't think I would have had the same appeal had I majored in Chem and minored in ChemE (not even sure one can do that?). \n\nChemE anywhere is hard, Mines infamously makes it more strenuous than it probably needs to be. Super rigorous time management skills will be an absolute must, but Mines ChemE really did refine my work ethic and my time management skills and ability to judge and execute priorities to a badass degree that has made me successful and very sought after in the professional world. Nothing has been as difficult as my undergraduate degree, and so nothing intimidates me anymore. \n\nDo I think Mines should reprioritize student mental health and life balance, absolutely yes. Am I a better engineer because I went through the ringer, absolutely yes. Was it worth it...? Idk, maybe. It's over now, and I'm happy where I am.",

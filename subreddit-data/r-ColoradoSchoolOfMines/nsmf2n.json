What would be the usual amount of merit aid I might expect from Mines?  I won't qualify for need-based aid so I was just wondering what I might expect.  TIA.",

As much as I like the school I think it's wiser for me to save money for graduate school. Even though my scores are high I know I do not have what it takes to win any competitive academic scholarships outside of what Mines might give me.  Thanks for all the advice!",

Some professors at mines also teach at RRCC. About 5 k per semester for 16-17 credit hr at in state tuition. This is before the COF fund comes into effect and the foundation scholarships at RRCC have high awarding rates.",

However, if you can get yourself financially independent right outside of high-school you can play the grant game when you come to mines in 2 years, this last semester was paid in full from grants and 2 small scholarships.",

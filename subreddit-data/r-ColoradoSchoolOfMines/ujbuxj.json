I think the lab part is what guides my rec, because having to write lab reports that often while taking lecture isn't fun.\n\nCalc is just calc, there's no lab so you can focus on lecture",

But if you are just trying to get the required chemistry out of the way, then that might be a good class to take over the summer. Same with physics. Calc 1 is definitely the easiest out of those three choices, but being on campus in the summer is fun, and why would you subject yourself to an online class if you don\u2019t have to.",

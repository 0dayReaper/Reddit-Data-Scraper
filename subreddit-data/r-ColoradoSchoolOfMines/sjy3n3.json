    "postText": "Hi, prospective grad student here coming out of a school struggling with a mental health crisis that has resulted in a number of tragedies this past year. I haven't seen any news about suicides or mental health issues at Mines, but seeing as Mines is overall similar in size, rigor, and culture to the school I'm coming from and mental health has been an issue everywhere with the pandemic, I was wondering what current students' experiences have been. Feel free to DM as well.",

My friends and professors, who knew my struggle, also helped.\nUndergrads usually say that the mental health resources at mines are poor but most of my professors tell me mines has the best resources out there than any other university they\u2019ve worked at. I cannot speak for the graduate students. \n\nI hope you get the help you need. DM me if you have more questions or just need someone to listen.",

I think no matter where you are, make sure you find a support system that works for you! Therapists, friends, family, whatever you need. I wouldn\u2019t rely on a university to take care of you in that regard. At the end of the day, their only goal is to collect your tuition money. Keep talking about mental health, though. The louder we get about it, hopefully, the more resources will be introduced.",

Search suicide on this Mines sub, and you will find several posts over the past couple of years about this issue. I personally know of only one death by suicide in the Mines community in the past 12 months. To anyone and everyone reading this - you are loved, you have value, the world needs you.",

We have had multiple deaths in the past year, and for each one, at the very least an e-mail was sent out to the student body. Two families opted not to disclose the cause. Given that Mines is a similar size, I would think it'd at least be important to let students know when a classmate has passed. It certainly mattered to me.\n\nThank you for your response. Since most of these issues have been incredibly recent here, I honestly just wanted a more recent update on how things are there.",

I don't think that's a cultural thing per se, just the brutal courseload (though at least one department is notoriously toxic).  It does help that they're usually very open about the struggle--it's impossible to think you're the only one feeling that way.\n\nIn my strictly anecdotal observation, this (strain) seems to be far less the case among the grad students I know (who may or may not be a representative sample), though the new (to Mines) grad students do usually seem to find their first semester rather trying.",

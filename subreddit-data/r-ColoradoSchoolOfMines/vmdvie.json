    "postText": "I\u2019m a senior in high school, and Mines is currently one of my top schools I\u2019m interested in. I\u2019m just curious what you think are the odds I\u2019m admitted?\n\nI have a 3.5 GPA unweighted over the last 3 years with an SAT of 1360. I would be coming from out of state as well. I feel like my GPA is lower than most students who apply to this school which is what I\u2019m worried about. Though, I feel I make up for this with a solid amount of extracurricular stuff (service hours, CS related courses with other universities, etc.) I\u2019m also visiting Mines this summer, which I\u2019ve heard can increase chance of acceptance?",

I would recommend writing the best essay you can as I think that\u2019s what really helped me get in.\n\nAs other people said you shouldn\u2019t have much trouble getting in but staying in will be a whole new battle. I recommend studying up on concepts you have trouble with in school right now, calculus, chemistry, etc\u2026 and if you can start to build some study habits that actually work for you. I know that I would have greatly benefitted from focusing more time on learning how I study best, it would have saved me a good bit of pain and time during college.\n\nGood Luck!",

They helped for electives, and that was about it. I took calc 1 again, despite having a 5 on the test, and I'm glad I did. College and high school (even AP) are different enough that having some repeat material was a good way to ease into it. I recommend it. It was still plenty challenging.",

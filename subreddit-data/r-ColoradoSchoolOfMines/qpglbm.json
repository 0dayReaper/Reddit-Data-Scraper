                    "comment": "Agreed. It would be the better choice to take Algorithms and PL together but I would recommend you take PL in the fall (avoiding spring and Dantam) if you can. The difference in the class as I've seen and heard is immeasurable. I would probably recommend if you have the time for it, you look to space out those 3 classes so you're only taking 1 a semester. OS will be a hard class no matter who you take it under, but with Programming Languages I've found you can save yourself tons of unnecessary frustration with the right professor. I've had Jed and Sumner this semester and they've been fantastic, very helpful teachers.",

Last semester I probably spent 20hrs per project with a few outliers going towards 30hrs.\n\nHowever, besides the projects OS is very chill. The homeworks and tests are pretty easy. \n\nPL is abstract and weird, and the labs can be very tricky. However, I think the workload is much less than OS. \n\nAs others have said the professor is very important for the PL experience.\n\nEdit: I also took Algo and OS at the same time.\nIt was definitely hard. If you're going to do that be ready to work.",

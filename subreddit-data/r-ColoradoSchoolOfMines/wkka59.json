    "postText": "Prospective student here. I am considering transferring to mines for the fall 2024 year (I will have 60 credits by then, but will only be 18 and technically fresh out of high school, from concurrent/dual enrollment) and was wondering what campus life would be like. How are the dorms and food? What are the activities like? Is it possible at all to have a car on campus? Thanks!",

            "comment": "Pros: \n\n\\-Dorms are a great way to meet people (suite style in my opinion is more introverted then say the trads or spruce etc)\n\n\\-Golden has a ton of hiking, running, and easy access to the outdoors\n\n\\-Easy to join clubs and do activities\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCons:\n\n\\-Foods kinda ass not gonna lie. It's getting better with Zime and QDoba, but it's pretty ass on the whole.\n\n\\-While the RA's are nice in my experience, very little effort is made to have 'dorm social events' etc. I saw a few events where literally ZERO people showed up. Not sure how different this is from other universities or if other people had a similar experience but you gotta find your own friends\n\n\\-If you don't make an effort to socialize, you won't. I think this is the con of Mines as a whole. It's difficult to be incredibly introverted and still meet other people, as so many people are introverted and focused on their studies. You have to take steps to prevent your own loneliness.",

I might be going it alone so i may need to try and make some new friends. Not sure if it will change any but i plan on going in as a mechanical engineering major. Ive looked around the website. Ideally id like to have my partner over every now and then as well too and go on hikes with them. I know theres a lot of land but i do wonder if its possible to go camping somewhere off one of the trails.",

For making friends you really gotta put yourself out there and join clubs and organizations. If you don\u2019t go searching for people to hang out with, you will find very quickly how lonely it can get here.",

From my perspective most ppl found the dorms okay socially but lacking in other ways. As for the food, Mines Market poisoned me throughout the year and I lost weight due to my distaste of the food. Qdoba was my saving grace for sure. It is possible to have a car as a freshman if you win the parking lottery, but in my experience you just need a friend with a car for the random outings. Most of my friends never used their car during the year and it was a huge waste of money.",

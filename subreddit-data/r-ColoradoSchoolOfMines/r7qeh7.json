    "postText": "Hello guys. \nI am making a plan on which classes I should take but I don't want to take the most difficult classes in the same semester. I think that it would be helpful if some of you guys can describe how difficult the schedule is and let me know of possible alternatives. By difficult I mean: how much time I have to put? Is the class difficult or is it somewhat easy but time consuming? \n\nThe schedule:\n\nEENG 281 (Circuits)\nMTGN 202 (Engineered materials)\nMEGN 300 (Instrumentation and automation)\nMATH 307 (Intro to scientific computing)\nMEGN 315 (Dynamics)\n\n\nAny input is greatly appreciated.",

            "comment": "MATH307 is easy and not much work, MTGN202 isn't that bad, MEGN300 sucks because the professor is horrible, circuits also sucks because its hard, dynamics sucks for that reason too. Its doable though, I did that schedule pretty much. Also if you want to graduate in 4 years you basically have to take at least 5 classes",

I had Ciobanu for Dynamics and he was absolutely awesome....he teaches it a little differently than some of the other instructors but he boils it down to what you actually need to know to solve the problems and the methods he teaches ALWAYS work. I had Hadi for Circuits and it was rough. He's a knowledgeable and thorough instructor, but the subject matter just isn't my cup of tea. That class convinced me that I should never try to go EE. Math 307 wasn't too bad...make sure you take advantage of working with your group and stay on top of assignments, though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Looking back, if I had to rank these classes by the difficulty I encountered when I took them it would go (in order of descending difficulty): Circuits &gt; Dynamics &gt; Instrumentation &amp; Automation &gt; Sci Comp &gt; Engineered Materials \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps!",

If the mechE labs are anything like the EE labs, you will be spending the full 3 hours and longer for every lab and asking TAs constantly for help. And if you don\u2019t know complex numbers, the second half of the semester is absolutely brutal.",

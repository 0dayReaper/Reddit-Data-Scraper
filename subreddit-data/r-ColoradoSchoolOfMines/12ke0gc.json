    "postText": "I\u2019m a first-year here at mines in sophomore level classes. For some of my classes, the averages on tests can be very low (meaning my test grade also tends to be low) and I find myself stressing about how much of a curve or if the scores will even be curved at all. \n\nIs it something I\u2019ll have to get used to where the average is like 55% and sometimes they curve it and sometimes they don\u2019t? Is there anything I can do if they choose not to curve it? Or is there a standard?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I'm an alumni so maybe things have changed, but most professors don't curve after freshman year in my experience. There were times when the entire class did poorly on a test and the professor would curve that specific test, but not the final class grade. That being said, I did have one professor who'd aim for a test average of 50-60% but then give everyone who did the homework at least a B at the end of the semester. So there are oddballs out there.\n\nAlso, it's not unheard of for a profession to curve down as well. This is far less common but it did happen in two of my classes.",

Depends on the prof and department I think. But at least the way it\u2019s been explained to me is those classes also have some \u201cpadding\u201d from homework and extra credit opportunities, so if you do well on those you can still pass even if the average is low.",

If a core req class at the standard freshman level is being failed that hard (several hundred students are in the class, huge sample size) then they need to step back and rethink how they\u2019re teaching.",

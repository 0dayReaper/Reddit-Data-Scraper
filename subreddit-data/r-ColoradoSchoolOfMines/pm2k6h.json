    "postText": "Hey All, Burnout is an almost inevitable part of the college experience, particularly at a school like Mines. It's certainly easy to get behind on studies and procrastinate (look at me on Reddit at 1 AM), but nothing is worse then getting behind on studies and then experiencing the hardships of burnout and not being able to take a break. So the best thing to do early on in the semester is to get ahead of the curve and give yourself a buffer if things start going south. But if you find yourself getting burned out remember a few things.\n\n1) It's okay, you aren't alone and burnout is a completely natural part of college\n\n2) Your mental health isn't worth finishing a project if it means that you won't have the mental stamina to forage onward the rest of the week.\n\n3) Sleep. Y'all please. Even if it's just a little bit. When you get to the wee hours of the morning we all know you're spending 20 minutes working and 45 minutes drinking red bull and watching tik toks. Go to sleep.\n\n4) Remember to have fun once in a while. Whether it be shredding some gnar on the mountain, playing siege, or just binging your favorite anime take breaks. Thank me later.\n\n5) A little controversial, but PRIORITIZE your classes. If you only got 3 hours of work in you and you got a 90% in a class work on the class that takes precedence even if the work sucks more. Get the more important work done first so if you end up not being able to finish at least you got the more important stuff done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs always, remember that we're all in this together Orediggers. Have a great weekend y'all and stay positive!",

But you end up with the message: \"Practice self-care! Now here's 40 hours of work due Monday.\"\n\nAll that does is promote this culture of \"put your head down and push through it.\" Again, while sometimes that's just what you gotta do when the going gets tough, it's simply not sustainable for four years (mileage may vary).\n\nI think it boils down to Mines being pressured to squeeze what should be a 5-6 year engineering program into 4 years. Classes are too rushed. Material becomes either surface-level or intractable. Consequently, many professors struggle to arrange a feasible and effective curriculum. That, coupled with rising class sizes and thin departments, is a recipe for overworking and a poorer regard for student health overall.",

Especially long term.\n\nAlso, Mines problem isn't that it tries to squeeze a 5 year program into 4 years. Its that the education level is so low. The majority of professors don't have any actual experience. They don't know what they are teaching so how can their students learn it? In your time here how many of your teachers were actually effective? I can think of 3.5 from my time here so far.",

It'd be much easier for me to count my ineffective professors during my civil undergrad (2, might be forgetting a few) than my effective ones (all the rest).  Most of the civil professors stick closely to practical examples, often from their own experience.  When the civils are stressed out it's because of the heavy courseload; reinforced concrete is going to be tough no matter who teaches it.\n\nGranted, MechE (you're a MechE, right?) is a pretty big chunk of Mines, and I know some other departments have issues with professor quality as well.  I did notice that the MechE and the EE running senior design were... not stellar.",

For the most part our students don't actually learn the subjects, they learn how to manage hating their lives. It's a horrible system.",

But within that they haven't been able to effectively recruit decent proffs. Within that I don't think they have a real way of getting real feedback.\n\nDuring Covid I was able to help ensure that a certain professor never returned. After talking with the department head, it was determined that they had no idea that they weren't doing their job. Its one of the many problems with this school. \n\nI don't know if I just interact with more departments than you but it definitely is not limited to MechE. The Comp sci department has some fairly large issues, unfortunately for them, the department head is at least partially responsible. The mining department also has its own issues, part of it is that it is shrinking,  getting fewer and fewer students every year.",

The latter is from the MechE department, but his research seems to be materials- and energy-focused (material fractures, batteries) rather than mechanical as such.\n\nThe MechE department is the largest almost anywhere--that's not a Mines thing, it's just a popular major (like CS, which is the second-largest, and EE, which is #5 after chemical and petroleum).\n\nI agree that the issue isn't limited to MechE, but CS is also well outside of Mines' specialty.  Mining has its problems too, but inexperienced professors or lack of practical exposure aren't among them.",

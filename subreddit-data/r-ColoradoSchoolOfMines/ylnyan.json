    "postText": "How horrible of an idea is it to skip CSCI 101 and take CSCI 200 with very little CompSci knowledge? For context, I am a freshman and considering trying to challenge exam out of CSCI 101, I am planning on majoring in MME or MechE with a minor in CompSci or Data Science. I have very little experience with CompSci/coding, but studying to test out of the challenge exam seems very doable. I've heard CSCI 101 isn't really that helpful/doesn't actually apply to later CompSci classes. How true is this? And if I skip CSCI 101 should I still take 102? Or jump right into 200?\n\nAny insight or advice would be much appreciated. Thank you all in advance!",

            "comment": "CSCI 101 at least when I took it was very much more history of computers and brief foundation/dictionary style courses with hw based on those concepts and labs just sort of there. Things may have changed since then however it isn\u2019t necessary to be successful for CSCI 200. However if you do take CSCI you may be required to take 102 if your a MechE as it is a lab for 101 and goes into more depth about Python programming.",

Or just start learning C++ and go from there? (It doesn't look like its a prerequisite for anything coming up and I could always to the equivalent course at Red Rocks.)",

If you have any interest in working in robotics, C++ will make you a *much* more competitive candidate for those positions, and it's not as easy as python to just pick up on your own. So it's professionally more valuable, and from an effort expenditure standpoint it makes more sense to learn it from a class and teach yourself Python (if you want) than vice versa.",

I know that they are using VS code instead of clion, and they get into really advanced concepts like pointers and template classes really quickly. From what I\u2019ve heard the class being taught this semester was too difficult and they might try making it easier, but I\u2019m not sure if that is going to be the case.\n\nBut from what I\u2019ve seen they moved really fast through the basics, so I\u2019d be careful if you aren\u2019t comfortable with those (loops, logic, functions) because they didn\u2019t spend a lot of time on it apparently",

Since it\u2019s a GEN Ed, the likelihood your complaint is taken seriously is much lower - since so many people pass through those classes I feel they\u2019re usually resistant to change (unless you\u2019re CSCI 101/102, RIP).",

We did this for a class in 2006\u2026 it was actually specifically about a final.  Most of the class signed it including students that benefitted from the issue at hand.  The department dean did take action.  \n\nAs others have said nothing may get done due to being GENED, but it helps to not be a solo voice and being specifics about the issue at hand.",

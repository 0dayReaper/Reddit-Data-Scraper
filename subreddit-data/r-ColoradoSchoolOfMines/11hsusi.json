It has a reputation for churning out good engineers, and one of the business secrets they don't teach in engineering school is that reputation is more important than almost anything else.",

            "comment": "I got the same degree as my brother, but I got mine from Mines and he went to a small liberal arts college. I will say that the Mines job fair is MUCH better and more extensive than his school's, and I had an easier time with getting an internship/job. However, he had options to take some classes that were more fun than the elective and HASS classes here. I'm sure it'll work out either way, and I feel like non-stem schools have a ton of variety so YMMV for sure",

            "comment": "I transferred from a standard state university, and my physics I class didn't transfer (because I didn't take the lab), so I got a direct comparison. That university is reasonably well-regarded and fairly STEM-focused.\n\nThe comparison depends entirely on the specific university and department (I did civil as an undergrad, which seems to be one of the better-taught majors here), but Mines coursework is *much* better. I had a far better understanding of mechanics after retaking it here (and not because of just retaking it - I had a *worse* grade the second time).\n\nMines coursework expects you to really understand the material and goes more in-depth. That's an important difference (again, compared to some other schools, not all).\n\nEdit: agreeing with another comment, the career fair is also way better here. It's probably twice the size (even though the other university was much larger) and far more active.",

            "comment": "Starting salary, name recognition, and actual knowledge. \n\nYou will be spending 90% of your learning time learning about things directly related to engineering. And the other 10% half on engineering adjacent and the last half in PE/liberal arts credits. \n\nYou will be surprised how much a good student out of Mines knows vs a good student out of a \u201cstandard\u201d university. \n\nThe downside is it gets grueling. And the above isn\u2019t a guarantee. It\u2019s just the average.\n\nEdit: this also depends on your major of course. If you\u2019re doing something more \u201cmainstream\u201d it might not matter. If you want to walk out with a BS in something more niche or focused that is another advantage",

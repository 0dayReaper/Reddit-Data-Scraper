    "postText": "Currently most of the way through CSCI 200 and took 101 last semester. \n\n*rant*\nI really enjoyed 101, at least the coding part, which I know will change in the future. The coding assignments in 101 were difficult but also extremely rewarding. As with most things at mines, you could tell lots of effort went into the assignments and labs, which made them fun. The main thing I loved was solving the problem and creating something that was my own. \n\nSimilar to 101, CSCI 200 has assignments with even more effort put into them and structure, but to a fault in my opinion. I feel I am no longer creating something of my own. I am instead investigating to determine the way some space should be filled based on comments rather than critically thinking to solve problems \u201cmy own way\u201d. I know 200 is supposed to focus more on efficiency of code and how a computer manages memory, but I miss the way 101 did it. All of these test suites are soul sucking with lots of work required and no rewarding feeling upon completion. I have no doubt the content is valuable and is presented in this manor for a reason (though I\u2019m not sure what that reason is).\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m an EE major and curious if I can expect classes in the future to be more like 200 or 101(coding or otherwise)? And what is the reason for the structural difference between 101 and 200?",

Also you will very rarely start a project from scratch in your job, so get used to working from a starting point and satisfying requirements. I\u2019d say the later coding courses are like 200.",

    "postText": "I recently got accepted into the McBride honors program but I'm pretty reluctant to accept, especially after my workload this semester. Juggling 5 semi-demanding classes and a research position on top of exercise, a social life, and other hobbies has really sucked the life out of me. While I don't regret taking on so much (since it's helped me self-reflect and realize my priorities in life), I don't think that throwing myself into more school work is going to help me grow as a person. Although McBride seems like a great way to share deep conversations and connect with people, I'm concerned that I'll feel pulled away from other areas of my life that have been lacking. I'm also considering graduating a semester early since I almost have enough credits, but in order to do so I'll have to double up on McBride classes one semester (most likely my junior or senior year). Is there anyone here who is in McBride or who has gone through it that can speak of the workload in terms of other HASS classes? Is there a lot of demanding projects? Do you ever feel like the work is too insistent or unnecessary? \n\nIf I decide to join McBride, I'm planning on doing my practicum while studying abroad. I understand that McBride offers scholarship opportunities to help students do so. Has anyone recieved one or know someone who has recieved one of these scholarships? If so, how helpful were they?\n\nAny insight is appreciated :)",

            "comment": "I'll try to help answer in the most thorough way I can so you can have a good picture of what it'll look like :) I am a McBride graduate, loved the program but at the same time, there are occasionally situations where you're really going to wish you took the HASS route. I'll explain more below. Also note, this is my experience with the program, so while candid, not what everyone experienced.\n\n**Workload:**\n\nWith the format of the program, once you're past (sometimes even before) the sophomore level courses, it'll be a new batch of classes. Often they are offered for one semester at a time which can be great for super unique courses and a sense of \"freshness\" each semester. The con to this is that whoever is in that class that semester will be doing these things for the first time and you can't ask former classes what to expect - there can be a general lack of accountability/consistency from the professor side of things since 'Hey, I won't have to teach this again'. It's typically minimal work until the final project where they expect a lot.\n\nI have doubled up on McBride courses before, however, as I said above, it is highly dependent on what two courses you will be doubling up between on how well that will work. I got very lucky with the semester I doubled up and I know how to b.s. essays very quickly when needed. If you are a strong writer/reader, you shouldn't have a problem with a semester of doubling up. Keep an eye on deadlines because nothing is worse than realizing you have two McBride essays due in the same week. Also, know that most McBride classes are on Wednesday nights, so you'd have to find an off-Wed night one to take in order for you to double-up. Just remember, if you want to double op on classes to graduate a semester early, make sure to add that additional McBride class to your plan. Also, you can take an additional course while studying abroad and have it count for a McBride class so you double up and get Practicum out of the way at the same time.\n\n**McBride vs. HASS**\n\nMcBride Pros: generally great classmates, great discussions, extracurricular involvement, you'll always get into one, Practicum, professors know you, technically get an extra minor, specialized courses, no exams.\n\nMcBride Cons: somewhat biased professors, inconsistency, typically scheduled one per semester, limited course pool, work will have the feeling of \"this is pointless\" occasionally\n\nHASS Pros: you know what you're getting into, you can take some at Red Rocks to get them done faster, throw them in wherever they fit\n\nHASS Cons: general 'who-cares, it's a HASS class' attitude, hard to get into good ones, work will have the feeling of \"this is pointless\" occassionally\n\n**Practicum/Funding**\n\nI received funding for my practicum experience however it was an absolute pain in the youknowwhere getting it. You can have to program pay for something outright with the funding you are granted or you can opt for reimbursement. I opted for the latter based on my timeline and it became a yearlong process trying to get the funding back. I do know some people who never got reimbursed. That being said, when I was reimbursed, I essentially had 1/2 to 3/4s of my practicum paid for. I'm not sure if there was a particular number limit they give but I'd say don't expect more than 3,000. Study abroad is much easier to get funding for/reimbursed for, as an aside. \n\n**Last thought**\n\nThe big part of the McBride program is the community. It's as if you are guaranteed to have a class with people that you know and have a history with. In HASS classes, you likely won't know people simply because they fill up so quickly that you either pick a good class, know nobody, or terrible class with friends. The community makes the workload manageable and less likely to \"suck the life out of you\" as you put it.\n\nI realize I wrote a lot, but I hope it in general answered some of your questions or at least some idea of what the program looks like.",

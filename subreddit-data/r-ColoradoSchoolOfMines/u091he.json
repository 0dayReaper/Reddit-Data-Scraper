There is no way I should have gotten this far. my achievements are meaningless and I feel like I am garbage \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a complete untouchable weirdo, no job would ever hire me. I am completely unskilled and most people think I am retarded.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am almost done and have nothing to show for it.",

If not, I can absolutely assure you that you do 80% of the learning on the job, you dont need to be the smartest person in the room to get a job. The fact that you made it through school alone means you're willing to put in the work and thats what employers are looking for. \n\nI've learned a lot from my time at Mines that people, especially people at Mines and in the engineering world are genuinely nicer than you may thinj. You may think people see you as a weirdo but I can guarantee all of our colleagues at school look at you and see nothing but a reflection of themselves, just an engineering student doing their best to make it through. I think you'd be pleasantly surprised if you were to go up to even some random \"Jock\" at Mines and just strike a conversation they'd be more than willing and happy to talk to you.\n\nJust take a deep breath, look yourself in the mirror and see that you made it and it wasn't just by coincidence, you put in the work and you are worthy and deserve to reap the rewards.",

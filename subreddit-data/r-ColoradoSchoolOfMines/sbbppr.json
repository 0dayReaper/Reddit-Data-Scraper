    "postText": "I'm a high school student considering Mines and have already been accepted, however to be honest it doesn't really seem to be for me. I don't know what I want to do but majors at Mines are limited and I don't have a strong interest in engineering or programming. The benefits of course would be that Mines is apparently very good for your resume. I hear it is difficult and think that going into it like this may not be a good idea, but I want to hear what actual students think",

If you\u2019re still interested in looking into a STEM program, I would recommend picking a school that\u2019s got more programs outside of STEM (CU for example) that way in case of emergency all you need to do is switch majors instead of transferring to a whole new school.  Best of luck on your decision. :)",

Supposedly \u201825 is the largest class so far, and there are fewer sophomore campus housing options next year because of work(?) on Mines Park. We live in Boulder. He has a car. He hasn\u2019t really yet found a crew, so wouldn\u2019t have hooked up with friends to rent with\u2026and just getting mentally adjusted so I haven\u2019t been pressing him about finding a place yet, although I see on FB that other parents are renting places or buying (?!) condos for their kids already.\n\nJust wondering whether it\u2019s totally bonkers to consider the option of living at home and commuting, especially when on crappy weather days like today 93 can be a nightmare to drive.",

I know people that have commuted a similar distance and plenty of them were fine. \n\nObviously it opens up the risk of severe weather keeping him home when the school isn't open (since weather can vary and Boulder might get slammed when Golden gets a dusting) but professors are likely to be accommodating for that.\n\nThe bigger thing to consider IMO is that it means he has to get up significantly earlier to go to class. And if he has an 8am class, that's going to be pretty rough.  Obviously he *can* do it, and he'll likely tell you as much, but if it means he's getting to school tired and not fully rested, that's an impact that needs to be considered. \n\nThat said, if he doesn't find anyone he's interested in living with, and he can't get into sophomore housing, it's not the worst idea in the world. Living with random people can be rough or it can be fine, depending on both him and the other people there. There's usually a house or apartment looking to fill in a spare room after someone left, so do keep an eye on Mines list for that.  But not everyone is up to just moving in with randoms.\n\nIf you can, maybe look at the armory? It's a building like a block from campus that's all single rooms, kinda like a dorm but not owned by the school. If he likes the look of it and it's not full, a place there might fit the. I'll.",

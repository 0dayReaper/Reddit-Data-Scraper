I am president of my school's comp sci club, vice president of the red cross club, ran 3 seasons of varsity track and cross country, am in Jazz Band + Pep Band as well as NHS and Tri-M.  From what I've heard though, applying earlier gives you a much better chance of getting in because Mines fills up. Best of luck to you!",

Would recommend getting to know them, they\u2019re all typically very friendly.\n\nWorkload: I once read on the \u201cMines scale of pain\u201d from 1-10 CS is about a 4. I agree with that, compared to the other majors its not soul crushing as long as you put in the work and go into office hours. You might find yourself struggling a lot in the early classes (depending how well you grasp them) but once you get into the 300 and 400 levels there\u2019s a momentum you pick up.\n\nResearch: don\u2019t know what you mean by access exactly, but I assume how easy it is to get into it. The answer is very, CS department will happily help you out.\n\nInternships: depends on how proactive you are, but personally it\u2019s been a great experience. Was able to snag one from career day as a freshman (which is uncommon). \n\nDM if you want to talk about anything else!",

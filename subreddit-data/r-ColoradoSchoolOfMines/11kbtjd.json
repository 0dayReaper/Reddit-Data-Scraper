    "postText": "I'm graduating in two months after living up the college life for six years. And am now realizing I will be leaving all my friends and will have no plans for the rest of my life. Like of course I'll get a job eventually but that's it. Has anyone else had this crisis, and does anyone have any cool plans after graduation?",

            "comment": "This is a very real fear that I dealt with too. My closest friends from college all got jobs out of state, so I felt like I was alone here. I didn\u2019t get a job right out of school, didn\u2019t have roommates anymore, and had no idea where I would end up so I moved back in with my parents for a few months. I didn\u2019t have the luxury of just being jobless or traveling, so immediately started working a full time job not in engineering. My life felt pretty hopeless, and I felt like I wasted 6 years of my life on college.\n\nI ended up getting a pretty cool job 3-4 months out of school and I\u2019m now almost a year post grad life and it turns out it\u2019s not as bad as you are thinking. Some of my friends kinda fell off the map because they have new exciting lives also, but others I still talk to regularly, and it\u2019s kinda fun having adult money and PTO so I can plan little weekend trips to visit. I made new friends at both my post grad jobs, sure we aren\u2019t super close yet, but I\u2019m not totally lonely. I have free time now so I feel like I actually have time to date, go to the gym, find a hobby. My life feels a little mundane now for sure, but with more time/money it\u2019s so much easier to break it up with exciting adventures, both local and non-local. \n\nIt\u2019s absolutely scary, especially when you don\u2019t have a job right out of school, but your time will come. Now more than ever you need to put in the effort to try new things and get out of your comfort zone. Your life doesn\u2019t haven\u2019t to be boring and not have any plans, you just have to put in the effort to make it exciting.",

You can live and work and stay in CO as long as you want. \n\nBut honestly now is the time to do something more interesting than just ... get a job and start working. You could go teach english in some foreign country, or work on a farm in a foreign country, or hell just travel. \n\nHaving no plans for the rest of your life is a very good thing. You can do whatever you want or can afford. Most people would be jealous of you right now. We're all stuck in careers and we can't just change that. I could not just take 2 months off to hike the colorado trail this summer, but you could. You're in this amazing position that most people can only dream of or remember fondly. My job and relationship and house and pets are keeping me very much settled in my routine, so I can't really do anything wild unless it fits into a weekend. And I don't even have kids!",

When I got laid off I was so happy, I could go for a hike or a run in the morning or afternoon. Only thing I regret I should\u2019ve done a van life.",

I knew a fair number of rich kids at Mines. \n\nI was not so privileged, so I immediately got a job and started my career. Just trying to tell OP that not having any plans can definitely be an opportunity. Getting a job is easy for mines grads. But they may never again have the chance to just fuck off for a year. This is their time to do something interesting before just buckling down to the career and the rest of their life.",

All your life until now you had a clear objective - graduate from school. Loosing that objective was really strange, but it isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. \n\nI second what has been said about not loosing all your friends. Keep in touch wherever you can, it can be really helpful. \n\nAnother thing for me was I stopped exercising as much (you walk a lot getting around campus). I never realized how much the simple act of going for a walk helped my stress levels. I try to get out and walk as much as I can now after work and on weekends.",

But really, it's like leaving high school for college or hell for some people leaving middle school for high school, just different scales/time frames. I left high school and didn't know anybody here but still had a great college life, made a bunch of new and best friends, and had a fantastic 4 years, and I imagine or hope it'll be the same for work.\n\nYou'll find new friends wherever you end up working, and you'll find new hobbies and if you really want, a new lifestyle down the line that'll make you happy, it's really just the sudden change that's scary. On the bright side, you'll have a lot more money to live it with!",

    "postText": "Hello. I am writing another discussion because one hasn\u2019t been opened up since 2018. Since Corona Virus has begun, do you think the suicide rate has changed? Do you think statistics are reported correctly? I think I have received one email regarding a student death this semester. Do you think Mine\u2019s efforts to prevent suicide since 2018 have worked? \n\n\nIn my opinion, the school needs more work. There is still a general consensus that students are struggling and the counseling center isn\u2019t doing enough. I don\u2019t think Mines uses our tuition to help current students, but to increase capacity for future students. What do you think? (Current and past students only)",

            "comment": "I've never considered suicide, but I've lost a family member to it, so it's a serious issue for me. I found the counseling center very helpful. They were aware of their limitations and recognized they didn't have what I needed, so I was referred to outside counseling. Here's the thing... I had to take ownership of reaching out to those therapists and find one that worked for me. It met with two and found a match in the latter, and it been amazingly helpful so far. The Mines health plan covers a large part of the cost and I pay a $25 co-pays each session.\n\nPoint is, I think you have to take ownership of your healing at some point. I moved here from another state, I'm an older, non-traditional student, and with COVID and living alone, the experience had been lonely and isolating. But getting therapy has been helpful and there are other things I can be doing. I hope it gets better for anyone who is struggling, but you have to do the work, just like with anything else. \u2764\ufe0f",

Now I pay for regular visits, slowly getting poorer. \n\nThe issue is: Mines has no ability to even provide temporary help to students. They didn\u2019t have the resources to give me someone to talk to once or twice. They didn\u2019t have the resources beyond send a generic list of local providers. \n\nEven as an older, non traditional student, the pressure of working on my project and classes and trying to find a therapist and etc. was insane. It pushed me to limits I hasn\u2019t been at since I was an undergrad at Mines years and years ago. \n\nWhich the counseling center was even worse then. \n\nSo I imagine there are others who struggle just as hard. Some may not have the mental endurance we do. I think Mines is obligated to give more help than it is. It may not be the counseling centers fault for being understaffed, but it is Mines\u2019 responsibility to fix it.",

            "comment": "I am so happy to come across this discussion, along with all the opinions and perspectives people have to offer about how Mines faces mental health and suicides. I have been at Mines for a couple of years now, and I was almost just another addition to this heart-breaking statistic. I\u2019ve struggled with not having the capability to form friendships, severe anxiety, and major depression way before entering Mines. After an attempt at taking my own life while being here, I can speak on some the resources and my opinions towards them after the event.\n\n\r  \nWith regards to the wellness center and everything inside, I would have to agree with a lot of points that have already been made here. They do take the route of referring you to external resources, that is just fact. However, just like someone said earlier, its what you choose to do with those resources. Sure, we can be pissed that we\u2019re not receiving immediate help or anything of the sorts, or you can take it as an opportunity to seek help and run with it. The medication providers in the downstairs portion of the wellness center are also very supporting of finding a medication that works for you, if this is a potential healing path you would want to go down.\n\n\r  \nThere\u2019s been some talk about implementing outside resources on top of work and school and how it just sometimes doesn\u2019t feel like we can handle it all. Nobody wants to hear it but its what myself and ton of others have had to do:\n\n\r  \n*Take some time off*. Even it\u2019s just a semester, maybe enroll part time instead of full time, maybe cut down on your working schedule if you have a job. Just do anything you can to make time to focus on yourself and your mental health, it\u2019s so much more important than all of that. That might be hard to believe, but think of it like this; if you\u2019re miserable, or god-forbid, you\u2019re not here to take advantage of all the things that you\u2019ve worked so hard for, then what is the point? Mines is a marathon, not a race. I think a lot of people forget that.\n\n\r  \nWith regards to care-reports, yes. These are usually handled by mines public safety like someone has stated. I do believe this isn\u2019t the correct way to implement these as the whole process just causes fear to the person and personally, I was given a sense of being *interrogated* multiple times from care-reports.\n\n\r  \nOne thing that has helped me, especially with having the ability to not make friends here at Mines, is finding faculty that are understanding of your situation and genuinely show care for you, and your fellow students here. Can\u2019t forget professors are human to! (Well, at least most of them). They understand things get tough and if you can find the good apples that will work with you, and talk to you, and help you succeed, hold them close and don\u2019t be afraid to even be a little vulnerable. Forming relationships with people you see on daily/weekly basis is a crucial part of having a healthy support system.\n\n\r  \nBest of luck to all the current students on their finals and end of the semester projects in the upcoming weeks! &lt;3",

Chances are that none of your professors care in the slightest about what you're going through, they just want to come in to class, right some stuff on the board and go home. My friend died at the beginning of November (he wasn't a student here), I found him laying on the floor when I got home from school. I was really depressed after this and couldn't focus on anything for a week after this, and only one of my professors was willing to let me have extra time completing the assignments that were due that week. Every other professor that I have didn't even respond to my emails. It is incredible how little any of the faculty at this school actually care about their students, all they want you to do is just jump through a bunch of hoops and complete all of the assignments that they give you without any regard to your wellbeing whatsoever.",

In the second half of my time at Mines they definitely started at least trying to change (whether they did well is obviously debatable). There were posters about counseling and multiple professors brought it up. I remember Decaluwe and my professor from Fluids 2 (weird but great guy, cant remember the name) both giving very passionate talks to the class to please please talk to someone and ask professors for changed deadlines if you need it.  \n\nIt would be hard to argue that there isn't a problem though.",

They did try to help me found outside counseling. By that I mean they gave me a list of people to call, all of which were filled up until further notice. \n\nLiterally called 16 (emailed a dozen more) counseling centers over a couple months before one would let me make an appointment.\n\nThe center should have had someone available to talk to during that time. Not saying be my full time therapist but at least an hour a month for a couple months. That seems reasonable.\n\nIf they don\u2019t have the personnel to handle talking to every student that needs it for at least one hour once or twice before they can find more permanent care, then Mines needs to hire more people for then.",

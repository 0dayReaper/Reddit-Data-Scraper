            "comment": "Practice using Excel to propagate formulas. A large part of field session reports is making graphs and charts from recorded data. For example, the heat exchanger lab has you calculate U and stuff like that. Ahead of time, work with formulas to get equations for what you need from what you will record. Then when you have your .csv data, you can just paste it in and then begin the \"does this make sense phase\". Field session has some 24 hour turnaround oral presentations, so speeding things up is ideal.\n\nBarankin likes memes. Give him memes and you get EC\n\nA large part of field is understanding why and how things are. You might get a numerically incorrect answer. That's fine; explain why it makes no sense and explain how it got that way. Was an adiabatic assumption justified (and is your deviance an indication of heat entering or leaving the system?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe statistics exam is just remembering what you learn. \n\nAspen is easy; Barankin is very good at it and will teach you what you need.\n\nSplit up work according to what you are good at. I was more comfortable doing the math and processing data. I didn't like writing fluff (executive summary, conclusions, etc), so others did it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso one more specific thing is the hot tubes lab (idk what it's called but you put hot cylinders in water or something). There is a chart given to you for you to get correlations or something from. I had a hard time reading it. If you remember how to use pdepe, you can derive that chart in 3 dimensions in MatLab. If you select time meshes at proper spacing, you can get the actual value of the function at specific points. (you should do that)\n\nIdk what else to post but you can just ask any chemE alumnus. There's also a chemE discord that Barankin is in, so you can ask him questions about field. Ganley is also a good one to ask since he's very involved in it.",

Accept that from field session beginning to end that\u2019s just about all you\u2019ll do and you\u2019ll be fine. \n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far (at least 3rd year) in ChemE you\u2019ve got what you need to do well in field session. Go have some fun before it starts",

And just remember it\u2019s only 6 weeks! For me the experience was just a lot of grinding. No work was extremely difficult but there\u2019s just so much you are forced to give up your social life for a bit and use weekends to catch up on sleep. Also share files with your team members. Sharing excel files, equipment diagrams, and just overall advice is completely acceptable if not encouraged by professors. Also **learn to let things go! Sometimes an extra 5 points is not worth your extra 10 hours of work when you could be starting on the next assignment.** Finally just don\u2019t expect things to go the way you think they should. Shit breaks all the time in the unit ops lab so at least be prepared to come up with a backup plan.",

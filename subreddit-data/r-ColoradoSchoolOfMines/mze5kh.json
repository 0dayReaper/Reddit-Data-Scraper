            "comment": "As a current junior CS major who wanted a challenge coming out of high school, I'm kinda disappointed with the program here TBH. A lot of the assignments to me seem like the easiest non-trivial work possible, and I've had a relatively easy time keeping a 4.0 major gpa. The overall culture at mines is def more academics-focused than CU, but when I compare what I'm doing here to what some friends are doing at places like UCSD or even UT Dallas, I honestly feel like there are plenty of better options for CS than mines. For my situation at least, knowing what I know now, I think if I was in your position I'd prob choose CU. Also, if you ever plan on looking OOS for jobs/internships, I'm sure CU is a more recognized school; lots of my interviewers for such position didn't really know about mines, whereas almost everybody will probably know what CU is. Just my 2 cents though, take it for what you want.",

That's definitely the case for many majors here, but I've seen very few well-known companies in high tech come to career fairs, whereas other majors seem to have many top-tier companies seeking them out. I think CU being a bigger name school nationally will attract better tech companies than mines, although there are plenty of opportunities here to work in older, more traditional sectors. Just not primarily the kind of really awesome work that most CS majors hope to do.",

I guess I can\u2019t speak for the covid career fairs since I didn\u2019t go, but there\u2019s always a ton of companies signed up looking for Computer Science compared to a lot of other majors. Also, odds are you can go talk to a lot of the other companies for other majors and they\u2019ll be looking for computer science majors too. And as much as field session sucks for those who already have internships lined up, it\u2019s great experience/resume work for people who haven\u2019t been able to find one.",

I haven't seen any other companies on the same level as Google show up (Apple, Facebook, Amazon, etc). I have typically seen on average around 5-7 decent tech companies like HP or Salesforce. My guess would be that more well-known tech companies would be attracted to Boulder than Mines. That said, there are plenty of opportunities here to work at big companies in other industries such as defense, manufacturing or energy, but these probably aren't the most desirable places for most CS students. Also, they're offering a field session in the Fall now for ppl with summer internships, which is really nice.",

            "comment": "It says a lot that most people on the Mines subreddit think you should go to Boulder.\n\nYes, the coursework is very outdated. The Intro to Software Engineering class uses Java's Swing framework which my textbook from 2006 says WAS becoming outdated then. It was released in 2000 and your final project will look like it came straight from the 2000s. I have a friend at Boulder and their Software Engineering course uses modern frameworks and their final is very impressive.\n\nYes, many of the CS instructors at Mines are graduate students and the real professors are stretched paper thin. My Intro to Operating Systems (CS442) class was taught by a first year masters student. My Intro to Machine Learning class (CS470) was merged with the masters program. Also, literally every assignment in OS and other classes required hot fixes while we were working on them. With 200 students each paying around $1500 for that class alone, this is completely unacceptable in my book.\n\nNow, where Mines shines is its name recognition. Employers in Colorado and abroad trust the Mines name. I have no idea why this is the case because the actual program is a mess. However, the rate of internships and average salary speaks for itself. I believe around 77% of students are employed over the summer and CS internship salaries average around ~$22/hr. I have been able to get a strong internship every summer Ive been here. If you apply to enough places, it is nearly guaranteed you'll find one.\n\nAnd, due to the relatively small size of the student body compared to most schools, I have had no problem finding research positions. For the past 11 months, Ive been researching COVID-19 which has been very interesting and has introduced me to very smart people.\n\nOverall, Mines has all the tools students who want to push themselves need. However, if youre looking for a strong program or mordern classes, go elsewhere. If I had to choose again, I bet I would still go to Mines because I know it has what I need to succeed. Not everyone is like me though and I know a LARGE portion of the CS students I socialize with are frustrated with the curriculum.",

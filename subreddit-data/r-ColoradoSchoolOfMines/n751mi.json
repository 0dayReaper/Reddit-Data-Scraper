There were a handful of additional assignments throughout, but they were stupid easy, never had to write more than 2 pages double spaced. I never invested more than an hour a week and passed with an A.\n\nOn the other hand, avoid abnormal psychology, I signed up for that one and dropped it because the amount of work was going to be insane, I didn\u2019t want to invest a ton of time, and the projects had ridiculous requirements.",

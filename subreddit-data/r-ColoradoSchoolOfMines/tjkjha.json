            "comment": "My degree is a BS in engineering with an Environmental specialty. I had a lot of classes like circuits, advanced engineering math, statics, that aren't really environmental but more on the multi disciplinary side. I also had a lot of the environmental side of stuff during the last two years. Senior design and EPICS we're all multi disciplinary groups. We basically made a concrete (w/ other additives) Lego for potential uses in emergency shelters. While everyone worked on the team in many ways, most of us ended up focusing more on what was interesting to our specialty...so I focused on the environmental side.\n\nI am now an environmental engineer, I work as a technical expert for hazardous waste. I have worked in mining, consulting, and inspections. \n\nI'm an old fart now though, I graduated about 10 years ago",

This major would seem to be a good fit for him rather than pursuing a degree in one specific area. Specialization as you did with Environmental makes a lot of sense. Thank you!",

I graduated in '08 and my silver diploma says \"with Mechanical Specialty\".\n\nMines was/maybe is best known for both the breadth and depth of education in mechanical/electrical/civil engineering programs. Which is a good thing and a bad thing, imo.",

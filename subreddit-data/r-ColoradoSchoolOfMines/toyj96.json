I was ChemE so idk how true that is, but that was always the joke.\n\nThe other thing to consider is the options PE gives you compared to some of the other majors. You can easily break into the Petro industry with ChemE or MechE, but not vice-versa with a PE degree. With the way energy is headed (next 40 years, not next 5) - might be better to be flexible.\n\nThere will still be Petro jobs for hundreds of years, but they might not be in the places you want to live. Just a thought",

I know a ton of PE majors that struggled to find jobs after graduation because of the downturn. We all got laid off during Covid and struggled for those 2 years. If you don\u2019t end up with a really high GPA, be prepared to go be a field engineer and work 14 days on (15+ hour days) 7 days off for a few years before you can get a normal 9-5 office gig. \n\nSome of the most successful professionals I know in the O&amp;G sector have Mechanical or Chemical engineering degrees. I would suggest one of those majors so you can still work in that industry if you choose in 4 years, or have a much better backup plan.",

Prepare to work hard, make and rely on friends, be near mountains. \nYour first semester gets planned for you. But make friends with your advisor (https://www.mines.edu/casa/advising/) to prepare for following semesters. (I worship the ground my advisor walks on. They are fantastic!)",

The industry is very sensitive to oil prices, and these has been fluctuating like crazy.\nIf you graduate at times when the industry is struggling and oil prices are low, you will struggle a lot trying to find a job.\nBut at times like now, job opportunities would be all over the place.\n\nAs far as the program, CSM\u2019s PE is known for reservoir engineering and well completion aspects of petroleum engineering. Third year is usually the toughest at least at my time, in terms of classes and workload.\nFourth year is a break, first two really depends on your background and if you took AP\u2019s and stuff",

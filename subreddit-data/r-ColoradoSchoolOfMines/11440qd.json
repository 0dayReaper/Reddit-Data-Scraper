    "postText": "My son and I are visiting Colorado next week and we'd like to tour the school, but all the official tour slots are full.  \n\nWe're fully capable of just walking ourselves around the campus but would like to chat with a current student who can tell us a little more about the day-to-day life on campus.  If any of you meet that description and would like to walk and talk us around campus for an hour or so for some $$$, please post here or send me a DM.  \n\nThanks,\n\nrd",

Unlocked server rooms and roof access, we're talking mild degrees of trespassing, and all the statistics PCJ doesn't want you to know about.",

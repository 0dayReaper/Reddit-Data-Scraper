    "postText": "I just found out that the apartment I was assigned is a 1800s building so it does not have any A/C. Can anyone who's been in the 1800s or 1900s share their experiences with no A/C apartments? I've grown quite accustomed to the Colorado weather and like to sleep in very cool temperatures. I imagine once October hits, the temperature will not be a big deal since the apartment has heating. I just want to know how hot it gets inside during the fall semester with no A/C. Also if I should buy an inexpensive unit to cool the room.",

            "comment": "I lived there too. Lack of AC  sucks. Over the summer I spent a lot of time outside the apartment (on campus usually, sometimes coffee shops or whatever) in order to escape the heat of the apartment. Usually it's not too bad at night, as the temperature cools down enough, but the days suck and the nights are still not great. As you said, once fall/winter hits it's not a big deal though.   \n\n\nI don't actually remember how bad fall semester is. I think you'll probably be fine for everything except maybe at the very beginning on the semester. But if you plan to stay there during the summer (as I did) it gets rather miserable.   \n\n\nI'm pretty sure the lease bans personal AC units, especially window units, but if that rule has changed of if you think you can get away with it then it's definitely worth it. If not, I'd at least buy yourself a nice high power fan.",

As soon as it gets cooler outside than inside, open all the windows all the way with box fans in as many possible. Close them all early in the morning and make sure you have decent curtains to cover them during the day. kinda sucks not having natural light but this will make it liveable inside",

A window fan or any kind of fan generating air flow helps a lot.  I also had a cheap stand-alone swamp cooler for a summer that in retrospect could have been good if I had cleaned it as recommended.  It wound up getting moldy and I threw it out.",

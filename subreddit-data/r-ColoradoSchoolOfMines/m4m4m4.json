    "postText": "I am a high school senior from New York state who has a very high likelihood of ending up at mines. Since I am going so far away I want to know what the geological engineering department is like, and what experiences you guys have had in it. I am mainly wondering about what are some of the best and worse aspects of the department, however if there is anything else worth mentioning please let me know. Additionally, how is the difficulty? I expect my first year of college to be pretty daunting at mines, even though I am currently cruising through AP Chem and AP Physics 2, while AP Calc BC is tricky, but still not problematic. Thanks for all the help, from what I've seen here you guys seem like a welcoming crowd.",

If your interested in construction, field engineering, or generally being outside it's not a bad place to be. Like any department there are superstars and medium professors. In non-COVID times there is a fair amount of field work.",

As far as difficulty relative to other majors, geo engineering is about average if not slightly easier. If you like being outside and learning about earth science, geo engineering is the place for you. Theres a wide range of cool classes that you take and they help you figure out what industry you want to go into before you graduate. We have a really fun field program in the summer where you camp for 6 weeks and look at rocks and stuff. Like all mines programs, some classes are really difficult but as long as you keep your head up through it youll make it through.",

I like the department, and most of the professors are nice, at least from my experience. \nI think it\u2019s important to note that you choose the track in Junior year based on the classes you take. The exploration track is more focused on minerals/petroleum, so you\u2019ll enjoy it if you\u2019re interested in these topics. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t know enough about the other track to talk about it. \nRegardless of the department, this school can be difficult and stressful at some points, but I think it\u2019ll be worth it in the end",

            "comment": "Compared to other geo programs you experience a lot more unique field work. Difficulty is probably higher than other geo programs too, but easier than other mines degrees. Profs are hit and miss but they rotate so who we had now might be different than who you have in 3-4 years. \n\nThe most important thing as an incoming freshman is to figure out what you want to do, so you can see if mines or bigger yet geological engineering is the right tool to help you reach that goal.",

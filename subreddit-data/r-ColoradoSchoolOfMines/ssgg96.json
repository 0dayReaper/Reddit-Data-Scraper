    "postText": "I\u2019ve been trying my best to pay attention to lecture in circuits but I just can\u2019t understand what the professor is saying or how to do it on my own. I\u2019ve been scraping by on the homework\u2019s but even when I try, I can\u2019t seem to figure it out. The TA\u2019s office hours are for a total of 2 hours a week and i can\u2019t go to any of them. Does anyone have any tips on how to pass this class? The way it\u2019s going, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll pass the class.",

            "comment": "Exact same thing happened to me last semester. Circuits is really hard, don\u2019t stress it too much. The only thing I got from the class was ohm\u2019s law, KVL/KCL and current/voltage division. All the stuff about complex power and z-transforms went right over my head and somehow I still passed at the end with a B-. Unless you want to specialize in power systems, there\u2019s a lot of stuff in 281/282 that\u2019s not super important. If you can ace the lab reports, that\u2019s a huge part of the final grade and it can balance out low exam scores.\n\nNot sure who your prof is but I had Peter Aaen last semester and he was amazing and really cared about helping EE students. Even if you don\u2019t have him for the class you could always swing by his office or send an email and I\u2019m sure he\u2019d jump at the opportunity to help with circuits. I went to his office hours weekly and he lets students write stuff on the board and explains it step by step, that\u2019s what got me through honestly",

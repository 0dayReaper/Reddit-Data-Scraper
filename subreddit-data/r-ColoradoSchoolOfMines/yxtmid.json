You can check out the classes in the rec center app or website, but they range from easy yoga (there are like 5 different types of yoga classes) to harder stuff like total body workout.",

Technically it\u2019s reserved for seniors but if you make the case that you are behind on credits and worried about graduating on time you\u2019ll get the override. Was a perfect solution since I was already taking other summer classes.",

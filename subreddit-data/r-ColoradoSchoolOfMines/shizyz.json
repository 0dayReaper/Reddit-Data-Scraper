    "postText": "I got accepted today and received a 9k scholarship out of state.\n\nI want to be serious in college and set myself up well in becoming a software engineer. Of course, I plan to do projects and internships. I also want to be able to pursue my hobbies of Powerlifting and Guitar while I'm there, but I'm also interested in League and Anime somewhat.\n\nMy biggest concern is how good CSM is for CS. I want to come out of the college with good knowledge and also was wondering how life is like there too. I also got accepted into other colleges like UTD, MSU, UH, and CU Boulder (exploratory studies).\n\nThanks.",

            "comment": "CU Boulder is pretty good for CS and the other schools are alright. But what sets Mines apart from the others are two categories. First Mines has a strong program in CS where the speciality you choose within CS allows you to take incredibly versatile and complex topics, such as data science, cyber security, and computer engineering. Some of these programs (data science and statistics in particular) have really good post graduate studies at mines as well. Secondly, mines focuses heavily on FORCING you to learn a vast variety of languages. This is partially true at all schools, but as a CS major in mines I've already had to use C++, Java, R, Python, Linux, Git, Matlab, and Verilog, and I'm only a junior. I can't 100% speak for other schools but I doubt the range of requirements is this vast. \n\nWhere Mines falls short is in the non-stem secondary studies. Outside of a small econ minor/speciality within CS, you are fully railroaded into engineering. This is both good and bad, but I know CS majors who can't write a paragraph much less express their ideas cohesively in a large scale research report. So if this is a deal-breaker Mines is not for you. But I would say Mines easily has the strongest CS program of the listed schools, showcased by the average starting salary of 78,000 dollars for a bachelor's and 93,000-100,000 for a master's. CU Boulder for reference is closer to 70k respectively.",

I am a CS student here and enjoy the faculty and classes a lot - program definitely isn't as crowded as other schools are.\n\nI think you should decide where you want to go to school based on where you want to spend the next 4 years of your life. Gender ratio here isn't something to be ignored (if that's important to you). Overall, choose the school you will enjoy yourself the most at.",

The great thing about Mines is the collective push/pressure of your peers to work hard and get internships combined with the push of the school\u2019s great career fairs and career guidance. \n\nAny school will get you a CS job, the difference will be in the internship and new grad opportunities/doors opened due to going to Mines. \n\nSource: am ChemE B.S. with a minor in Comp Sci from Mines and went directly into software upon graduation",

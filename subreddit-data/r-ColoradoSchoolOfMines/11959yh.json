I don't ask this to be mean, I just want you to reflect on it.. are you actually trying to pass? I bs'ed my ay through econ and Hass.. I mean.. it's Hass. I get, as an aspiring engineer, those classes kind of suck (especially econ) and you might think they don't apply to what you want to do. \n\nYou can do it! If you've gotten this far you can finish the rest.",

Those really helped me understand some of the basics in chemistry that I suck at",

I think it\u2019s best to take most gen ed classes at red rocks. Saves money and it\u2019s less stress",

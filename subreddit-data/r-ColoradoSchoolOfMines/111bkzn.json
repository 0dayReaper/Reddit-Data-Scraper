Only a dog got shot and killed, not a student so back to class!\n\nI love knowing that if we had an active shooter Mines and Golden PD would shelter in place for 6 hours cowering alongside the freshmen in Elm. Oh, and if they caught a real school shooter who kept FALLING ASLEEP they would also accidentally let him break free.",

    "postText": "Hi. I'm coming in this Fall to the CS grad program. My advisor recommends I take only 3 courses, so I've browsed the catalog and found some that interest me by title/description. As I've never been to Mines, I don't know the professors or courses at all, so i'd appreciate any information that anyone can provide me about the courses, workload, instructors, etc.\n\n```\nSYGN 502 (1) ???\n    - Introduction to Research Ethics\n\nCSCI 423 (3) Hellman\n    - Computer Simulation\n\nCSCI 507 (3) Thomas\n    - Introduction to Computer Vision\n\nCSCI 536 (3) Thomas\n    - Human Robot Interaction \n\nCSCI 561 (3) Dantam\n    - Theory of Computation\n\nCSCI 562 (3) Mehta\n    - Applied Algorithms and Data Structures \n\nCSCI 578 (3) Can\n    - Bioinformatics\n\nCSCI 598B (3) Thomas, Han\n    - Augmented Reality\n```",

            "comment": "Welcome to CS@Mines!\n\nTheory of Computation is a brutal class, but you will need to take it eventually. Dantum uses a flipped classroom method to teach, which I found effective, but meant serious time outside the classroom needed to be dedicated to watching lectures, reading the textbook, and working on homework/worksheets. There are also large group projects programming in Lisp throughout the semester.\n\nWilliams is a great teacher; his research focuses on Human Robot Interaction and Social Robotics. I've had HRI and Robot Ethics with him. HRI was fascinating and didn't need excessive outside class work. I know it's not on your list, but Robot Ethics involves tons of reading and writing every week. I haven't taken it yet, but I've heard great things about Computer Vision. \n\nI'm going to take Augmented Reality next semester and I'm pretty excited about it. I have no idea what to expect for the work load.\n\nHope that helps!",

                            "comment": "Hri was suuuuuuper easy and maybe could have been a little better organized. Class is kind of split between actually working on a robot and discussions on different topics of hri. This results in maybe not feeling like enough time was given to either half of the class, in my opinion.\nIn hindsight I would have taken something else, but hri isn't my main interest and I am more interested in applied problems which you didn't really have much time for. Williams is a great professor to interact with though.",

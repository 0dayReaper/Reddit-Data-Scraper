                    "comment": "Yeah... It's not 1 unit op per week anymore. Or at least wasn't when I did mine during the summer of 2015. We did one the 1st and last weeks each, and two the other 4 weeks each.\n\nIt's a damn gauntlet, but it was useful and really brought all of thermo, fluids, and the xfer classes into focus. Types of labs that I remember are:\n\n- comparing the overall heat xfer coeff for different heat exchangers\n\n- Something with PSA\n\n- pumps in parallel and series and their efficiencies\n\n- comparing pressure drops across valves\n\n- something with membranes, I think it was just seeing how well it separated air into N2 and O2\n\n- pitot tube to figure out the flow profile and some mass xfer coeff deal with different wet sponges and an air tube\n\n- packed columns CO2 absorption\n\nThose are the ones that stuck with me.\n\nAlso, make sure your Excel game is on point.\n\nDefinitely agree with taking a rest on the weekends, at least one day. And be ready to sleep in Coady lab for at least one lab that goes horribly wrong.",

                            "comment": "Yup I did field session last summer and this basically summarizes it. 8 different labs with 7 different groups in 6 weeks. The labs you mentioned are all the same except the pitot tube one is now a friction coefficient and orifice meter one. The final lab you do twice to test more hypotheses. The first week is still one lab like you said but it\u2019s supplemented with a writing workshop, statistics workshop, and \u201chigher order thinking\u201d workshop. There is also a pretty easy statistics test end of the second week. Along with two labs every week following you also have homeworks and lectures around Aspen plus, sizing, and economics. \nFor tips and advice: Don\u2019t schedule anything else or work during those 6 weeks. Also, reach out to the professors and constantly communicate with them. The more you communicate with them the more work they are seeing you put into it and the better grades and professor reviews you will get. Also, if there are any group issues, specifically with the lab you have to repeat, let it be known to the supervising prof. Just think of this as your 70 hour/week job for the next 6 weeks, grind hard, and learn a lot. And bring a lot of water. They will start class telling you how hated, yet valuable field session is. This is true, so try and focus on the value and push through the resentment. Good luck",

Ran out of ADHD meds a few days before it started and couldn\u2019t get any more until my physical a few days after it ended. Needless to say I was unhinged and got the worst peer review grade for attitude out of everyone (my apologies if I was ever in your group \ud83d\ude05). Barely passed with a D-\nBut if I could make it through you definitely can OP!",

            "comment": "I can add a little update for anyone who ends up here in the future (this is from 2021)\n\n1. Length \n5 weeks, technically the last Friday is off this year. \n\n2. Types of Labs (you only do 8 of these, you repeat one for a ninth lab at the end)\n- Staged distillation (mccabe thiele etc)\n- CO2 adsorption (idk pay attention in separations)\n- Membrane Air Sep (flow N2/O2 over a membrane, characterize membrane)\n- Gas Absorber (pita, absorber/stripper combo, titrations and more sep)\n- Thermal conductivity in solids (inside, you get AC instead of brick oven, you dip things in water and read computer data)\n- Friction factors, drag coefficients (flow water through pipes, then drop things in columns of fluids, lots of human error which is kind of annoying but kind of fun)\n- Transient tank heating (most people hate this, I didn\u2019t do it but it sounds crappy)\n- Condensing steam (heat exchangers, don\u2019t overfill the tank or the unlucky people in Cd and Ff that day, like me, will get rained on)\n- Adiabatic cooling (blow air through a tube, measure it with stuff, throw a wet sponge in to turn it into a swamp cooler, measure some more stuff, super easy but time consuming and the math is kind of annoying)\n- PSA (ridiculously difficult honestly horrible just hope you don\u2019t have to do this one for an oral report)\n- Compressible flow \n- Shell &amp; tube, brazed heat exchangers (maybe this one rained on us? I didn\u2019t do either)\n- Pumping and minor fitting losses (turn a hunch of valves and read gauges, super easy)\n- Fluidized bed ht xfer (? didn\u2019t do it)\n\n\n3. Timeline (avg week for a MW lab group)\n\nM: \n- lab report draft from previous Weds due 9 am\n- pre lab meeting (know everything about everything, you\u2019ll be graded if you\u2019re group leader) \n- lab, usually ~9-5\n- work on your oral for today\u2019s lab\n\nT:\n- draft review with supervising lab prof\n- draft review with writing prof\n- work on oral report until you give it\n- oral report for yesterday\u2019s lab\n- work on your report draft (prev weds) if you\u2019re smart\n\nW:\n- pre lab meeting\n- lab\n- try to work on report draft (prev weds)\n\nT:\n- report draft due (prev weds) at 3 pm\n- a day your can finally sleep\n\nF:\n- maybe a workshop (writing/formatting/stats) or 2\n- general meeting\n- Work on report draft from this weds\n\nS: \n- maybe sleep in, work on anything\nSun: \n- finish report draft, prepare for monday lab\n\nThere are some exceptions, there\u2019s stats hw and an exam, no drafts for the final report, only a weds lab the first week, and the final (repeated) lab is presented as an oral report on the last thurs \n\nYou\u2019ll get peer and prof reviews so don\u2019t be a d*ck to anyone and do your work. \n\nThere are also two hazop assignments, sort of safety analysis for a certain lab. \n\n4. Tips and advice\n- sleep when you can, don\u2019t procrastinate\n- don\u2019t make any other plans\n- stay on top of things, use a calendar or planner and lots of phone alarms\n- try not to get addicted to amphetamines\n- definitely hone your excel skills",

    "postText": "Hi everybody! I am gonna be moving soon to Golden (or its surroundings) to work as a postdoc at Mines. I am from Spain so I am totally lost about whether the salary that I have been offered (50-60k) is good enough for me to live well in the area. I have been looking for information about this online but\nthe answer really depends on the website! Can anyone help me out? I am single with no pets and do not need a huge place to live, altho I would prefer not to share an apartment/house. I think that renting a small studio would be great for me. Is that salary ok? will I need to share a house or will I be able to rent a studio for myself? will I be able to save some money at the end of the month? I am planning on traveling back to Spain every several months so I will need to save some money up for the tickets!\nthank you all!!!",

If you are not planning to buy or lease a car, there is a good public transportation system which connects Golden to Denver and the airport. Not having a car would help you save money but you might miss out on the outdoor activities depending on how interested you are on exploring. Hope that helps.",

                    "comment": "thanks for the help! I am actually planning on buying a second hand car (which I will sell after my postdoc, so I consider that as an investment from my savings), but if I live in Golden I will probably not use it much during the weekdays, only during the weekends to go hiking or whatever I feel like doing. If I live further, I may use it to go to work, how much can expenses related to having a car (except actually buying the car) be? I am not sure about whether it is worth to move to Golden even tho leasing's more expensive just not to have to spend on gas. Again thx for your feedback!",

                            "comment": "It does depend on what car and how much you drive it. A full gas tank is maybe $50 right now and could last you 1 or 2 weeks if you go up to the mountains on weekends, and insurance for an older car may cost $50 to $100 per month. Maintenance costs maybe $200 for oil change and tire rotation, 2 times per year. If you live in Golden you could bike to campus or the grocery store or the bars and that will be both fun and good for health and save money, though you'd need to get a bike which can be a couple hundred dollars for a used bike or up to multiple thousand if you get a nice new bike.\n\nGolden is a really fun town, and in my opinion you should really consider living there during your time at Mines. If you can make the budget work out, it's a lot of fun to be right in the heart of things. If you live in Lakewood instead of Golden, you might save a little on rent but you might miss out on the \"college town\" stuff. If you live in Golden you'll be more able to do things with friends in the evenings, the bars are much more fun, you can ride the bike to house parties, a much shorter commute is good... Golden is where people desire to live and retire if they can afford it so take the opportunity to be there while you can, instead of the boring suburbs. And it's so close to the mountains. I loved living there. Hope this helps!",

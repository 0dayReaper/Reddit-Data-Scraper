I've seen people get ticketed despite having parking passes, and I've myself been ticketed for the briefest of parking violations. \n\nThey are one of the four evil entities that make the Mines experience unbearable.\n\n1) Mines Parking Services\n\n2) Resident Life\n\n3) Sodexo\n\n4) The Mines Bookstore\n\nThese 4 organizations on campus yield the power to ruin one's day.",

And thus the fact that you should go through 3rd parties and avoid the bookstore like the plague showcases how awful it is. \n\nTextbooks: Overpriced\n\nSchool spirit clothing: Overpriced and unlicensed clothing is banned by the school\n\nOther materials: Overpriced\n\nGiven that I can't see a single positive attribute of the Mines bookstore I would say that yes they are a scummy entity that should be avoided at all costs. Not the people working at the bookstore, but certainly the bookstore as an entity is terrible.",

At the beginning of the semester I got 3 citations for my car even though it was on the permit. So I emailed them pictures of the citations and a receipt of when I purchased my pass. Wanna know what their response was?\n\n\"Even though you have two cars on your account, only one got registered on the permit and the other one had to be manually added by us\"\n\nWhen I bought the pass, there was no indication that both of them didn't go on it. It was the most absurd situation ever.",

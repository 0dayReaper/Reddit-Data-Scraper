    "postText": "I'm listening to [a podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/earth-and-environmental-science-audio-podcast/id439365947) by Dr. Christian Shorey which is lectures from a course called Earth &amp; Environmental Systems. \n\nDr. Shorey makes a few references to course notes that can be downloaded from the Apple Podcasts page...I tried to find them, but they're no longer available. I tried to email Dr. Shorey to see if he would email them to me but didn't hear back.\n\nDoes anybody have this material from taking the class in the past? I would greatly appreciate being able to get it to supplement the podcast! \n\n[I doubt it matters but I've been out of school for years and I'm  listening to the podcast out of personal interest--not trying to cheat in the class or anything.]",

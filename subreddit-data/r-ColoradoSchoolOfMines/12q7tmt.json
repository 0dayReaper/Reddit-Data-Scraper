I\u2019m fairly happy with my GPA now but I know that as time progresses and classes get more difficult, my outlook will likely change(especially as I begin to enter some junior level classes). I know about taking summer credits, but what are some other ways I can ensure my GPA will stay \u201chealthy\u201d? Just looking to start early because from what I understand, things can go downhill quickly. Thanks!",

            "comment": "I don't have any advice for specific classes, but I do strongly suggest getting a good study group together once you're start taking your major-specific classes. Don't try to do tackle those classes on your own. The other people in your major will be on a similar track and you'll likely have a bunch of overlapping classes.\n\nFind a group (or make a group) of people within your major to regularly study and do homework with. This will eat into your time with friends you may have already made who aren't majoring in the same thing as you, but it's worth it.\n\nAlso, if you're bold enough, set up a group chat with all the students in your major. Obviously this is more department size dependant, but if your department is small/close-knit enough setting up a group WhatsApp with everyone is also massively helpful. From there you can post questions to the entire class, as well as setup test reviews for any interested parties. A class-wide Google doc where people add notes is also helpful.\n\nThese are all things our graduating class did second semester sophomore year of geophysics and I can't even describe how helpful it was for junior and senior year. Luckily for me, I didn't have to spearhead this personally. There was a very outgoing (and cocky) baseball player who took the time to get everyone's contact info and setup the WhatsApp &amp; Google docs for us.",

            "comment": "As much as you can, take classes in their suggested order -i.e. follow your major's flowchart. Ime, even if you don't necessarily *need* to take classes sequentially which are suggested to do so, in practice the profs usually assume you'll have already taken the previous class, and you're going to be a little more confused than your peers.\n\nI'm graduating this semester, and at this point, I'd say office hours is 100% mandatory if you want a *high* GPA (at least 3.5) and you aren't just a natural academic god. Obviously you should go to clear up any confusion you have about the course content, but also ask about what will be on exams, ask for tips for projects and other big assignments, etc. Ime, profs/TAs can be almost *too* helpful during office hours (e.g straight up tell you what's gonna be on the exam; basically hand you the answer to tough homework problems, etc). A lot of people do okay without office hours, but again, if you want a *high* GPA, I'd say they're mando.\n\nThe next thing that seems pretty much universal among those with really high GPAs is: study/do homework with friends. It's a major reason why the greek (frats and sororities) and athletic students tend to have higher GPAs. It'll help you stay engaged with the coursework even when you really don't get it and would rather ignore it; you usually have a friend who understands what you don't who can help you out; and (frankly) people who study in groups often just share answers with each other. Make sure you learn the material, but there's no denying that it happens and that it's going to give your GPA a boost.\n\nDon't burn out, and don't procrastinate. I think the best way to do your schoolwork without too much stress is to do a little bit each day, or at least throughout the week. A good way to start that habit is to do your homework at office hours. I even made it a rule that I would *only* do homework during office hours, and that helped me get into the office hours habit, stop procrastinating, and raise my GPA.\n\nI'll think of others and add them in an edit, but those are the first things that came to mind.",

I know there are companies that have gpa requirements for new hires, but those companies are few and far between. \n\nThe classes get harder, but easier, when you get to your major-specific courses. At least, for me it felt that way. The content was harder, but I enjoyed learning stuff that was relevant to my future career and stuff I found interesting so it was easier, in a sense. All the fresh and soph courses were weed out courses, and set the fundamentals that all the engineering and science is based on.",

One in particular and I'll call the company out here, was Boeing helicopter in Mesa Arizona.   The role was in systems engineering, literally to write documentation.   3.0 GPA minimum.   #ironic   \n\nLast company I worked for did the same thing, and wanted to see BSEE  transcripts from over 35 years ago!  informed me that the offer was so generous because I had a 3.0.  :-)   \n\nThe offer wasn't that generous TBH, but the work was interesting and things were okay for a couple years until I could leverage that learning and experience into a better,  higher paying position elsewhere.",

If you get stuck, ask them a question. Most profs have a whiteboard where you can work through a problem and they can coach you when you get stuck.\n\nI'm pretty sure my quantum mechanics prof passed me out of pity solely because I *was* attending office hours and still struggling, lol.",

This is assuming that you're interested in your major!   \n\nI don't think it's the classes that get any easier but that your overall skills increase.\n\nLearn and develop better time management and how to leverage all the resources available. It's a thing Juniors and Seniors have that Freshman and Sophomores don't. \n\nThe fact that you're aware and staying present is huge.  Don't let it stress you, instead, actively learn from every class and experience even if the prof is shitty or your grade on a test / project / class is not what you wanted or expected.   \n\nUnfortunately Mines doesn't have a ton of general Ed type classes to help bring up gpas.   The classes that are available still tend to have an engineering twist to them.  Finding ones that explore a cool topic, or something that holds your interest is key.",

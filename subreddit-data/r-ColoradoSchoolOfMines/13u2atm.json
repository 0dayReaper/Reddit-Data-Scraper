I also did o chem at RRCC and learned so much more than I ever could at Mines \u2013 not because it was easy, but because it wasn\u2019t a bunch of busy work and the class wasn\u2019t made to be unnecessarily stressful.\n\nThe prof also worked with me when I had a health crisis and let me take an exam like a month later than scheduled and turn in lab reports late, meanwhile at Mines I had to beg the dean to help me because the profs said there was nothing they could do for me, even if they were generally good people.\n\nIt\u2019s crazy to hear you got in trouble for having high averages in your lab sections.

I love Vyas, but in undergrad I got the lowest C you could get in his class \ud83d\ude02, but I made up for it in Grad school by getting a B+ in advanced PChem. Given\u2026 grad school classes are basically just \u201cshow up, try, and you\u2019ll get at least a B- which you need to pass the class.\u201d\n\nAnd yeah, the reason my gen Chem students had good grades was because I actually walked around and made sure they were doing things right before they turned anything in. I was never just sitting at my computer. I figured if I address problems now, it\u2019s easier grading later on and they might actually learn something. And the director hated it because my students got good grades \ud83d\ude02. I much preferred TAing OChem, I was allowed to grade however I wanted, and so every single one of my OChem students got at least a B+",

Mines was the only grad school that I applied to that functioned this way \u2013 the grad schools I visited tailored classes based on your research area, and my classes now are approved by my advisor/committee/department head. I do see the appeal for some folks, but I\u2019m in a very niche area of chemistry and couldn\u2019t justify going through the pain of p chem again. I\u2019m happy to hear that advanced p chem went better for you, though!!\n\nI completely agree with the mindset of addressing problems earlier rather than later. A B+ average in o chem is awesome, it was scary hearing about the 30-40 averages for exams and 50-60 averages for lab reports. I fortunately don\u2019t have to TA, but part of me wants to sign up for a year or semester at least so I can be the TA I wish I had. Based on your responses I don\u2019t think I had you as my TA, but I\u2019m sure it would have been a lot better if I did!",

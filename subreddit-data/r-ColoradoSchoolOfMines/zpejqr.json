I plan to go to the mountains in the summer (when it is warm), but not in winter. I have a honda accord which is fwd. I have been to Golden once, but that is all. Based on that, fwd was enough.. let me know because I don't want to die in a car accident. Thx",

            "comment": "FWD Is totally fine, but I want to reiterate that you really ought to get winter tires if you only have FWD. Accidents *do* happen here on snowy days, and Mines is on a hill; I've seen cars lose control sliding down it, or drift into the curb at turns because they didn't have enough traction, etc. Also, it's a college campus, there are hordes of people walking all over the place at all times, all over the streets, emerging suddenly from between cars parked on the side of the road, etc. It's a lot easier to drift into parked cars or even pedestrians than a lot of people here realize. So yeah, you don't need AWD, but *definitely* get the winter wheels. And remember that *you* may have control of your vehicle, but not all drivers around you do. If you see a car struggling to get going from a stop or if they're going really slow, be careful passing them or just wait behind them, they may not have enough control of their car to *not* slide sideways into you. I live at the corner of a 3-way intersection lol, winter is always \"fun\" with all the accidents that happen right outside our house.",

            "comment": "You need winter tires, even if you did get AWD - which in my view, you don't need. AWD helps you get going from a stop - winter tires help you slow down and go around corners. \n\nI drove three cars while at Mines. \n\nFirst, a FWD on all seasons. It was decent, and got me to Grand Junction through snow, but required care if I slowed to a stop on a hill and wanted to get going again. I made some aggressive maneuvers, and one time the traction control activated for a moment - but I didn't notice any loss of grip or change in momentum. \n\nSecond, a RWD on all seasons. It was bad. I drove it up Lookout Mountain in fresh snow. I got up securely, but only because I had a limited slip differential.\n\nThe third was RWD on good Michelin snow tires and it was phenomenal. It felt like nothing challenged the car. It was physically possible to lose grip, but I had to go around a corner at 30 MPH and floor it to do so - even with snow on the road. \n\nAnother factor to consider is controllability - when your car does lose grip, how much danger are you in? I had a roommate with a Honda Pilot with a good AWD system, on good snow tires, who slid off the road twice. A lot of SUV qualities, namely mass and center of gravity, make emergency handing more difficult. An Accord is pretty light and low, so I'd say you're going to do well.",

All wheel / 4-wheel drive is great to have, but completely unnecessary for urban driving even in winter, and only needed in summer if you're going up rocky roads to 14er trailheads.\n\nThe most important thing, regardless of drivetrain status, is the tires themselves. 4WD with bald tires is much worse than FWD with good tires. Just make sure they're all-season tires with a decently deep tread. I drive around all over in the snow with a little FWD car with good all-season tires. And just drive slow if it's snowy. Usually the roads are only snowy during the snowstorm and one or two days afterwards. The plows and the sun work pretty well out here.",

So while yes winter tires may be enough for some vehicles and most importantly skilled drivers it may not be what everyone would feel comfortable driving with. Golden being in the foothills can receive some pretty brute force storms and even that drive to Boulder can as well. Depending on how confident you feel driving in all varieties of winter weather should be the real deciding factor for your vehicle and your peace of mind. I do think FWD with WINTER tires would be best. There are some \u201call season/weather\u201d that claim to be winter but honestly are a waste of money and won\u2019t help much come winter. Go for genuine winter/snow tires and you\u2019ll be good to go with FWD only if you have driven in the snow some.",

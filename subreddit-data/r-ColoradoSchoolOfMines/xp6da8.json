    "postText": "Like many other Mines students, my experience with the PA classes here is that they've been absolute jokes. I've taken all 4 of my required PA classes and only one of them took any amount of effort. Walk around a track 20 minutes, show up to a class where they're supposed to teach you the basics of lifting but instead give you free reign and absolutely no instruction for an hour a week, worst of all in the covid semesters log 10 hours of activity in a google spreadsheet without needing to supply any proof. Come on! This is ridiculous!\n\nI'm all for a PA class requirement. I'm a firm believer that being active is a critical part of living a happy, balanced, and physically and mentally healthy life. I don't think the sole purpose of an undergraduate degree is to tunnel vision on a single subject; variety is a positive addition to the curriculum. I've gone into every PA class optimistic and excited to learn more about an activity that's new to me. And I learn nothing! Zilch! Nada!\n\nIt's a waste of time at this point. Why bother requiring these classes if they're not held to any reasonable standard of quality? I want to walk away from these classes feeling like I've actually learned something! I've left feedback in every course survey that I wish there was more actual instruction in classes but they never seem to change. Is that too much to ask?",

I was hoping to get some light instruction and coaching, but was given free reign, as you mentioned, OP. That's just not acceptable in my opinion. It also doesn't build whole-life habits that you can sustain outside of school.\n\nSwimming was an entirely different beast. I had previously competitively swam up until high school, so I was mostly getting back to what I already knew. The first day was easy: 25 yard swim to make sure we could actually swim. We thought it was going to be another joke PA class, but the second day, we had a 100 yard warmup on a kick board, followed by several hundred more yards of work. I think by the end, we were doing in excess of 1500 yards a class. It was intense, but really really great. It helped build life-long habits, but we don't always have access to a swimming pool we can lap swim in, sadly.\n\nSo I think it depends on the class and the instructor, but I had a great experience with swimming.",

It's so easy to injure yourself while weightlifting, running, doing sports, etc, so I would think the college would at least attempt to teach the proper form and offer guidance that students could apply throughout life. Plus, I'm at Mines because I'm a nerd; it would actually be great if the school offered a healthy, enjoyable introduction to sports since I never cared about them during childhood. But yeah, very interesting post. Have you thought about bringing it up with the school, by chance?",

When I was in middle some idiot was benching alone and dropped the bar on his face which gave him a concussion and had him out of everything for a week. If you can seriously injure yourself with just 50 pounds (which is much less than most 20 year olds should be able to put up on bench press) Imagine the consequences of more weight.\n\nIf a student got hurt in one of those classes it\u2019d be an easy open and closed reckless negligence case.",

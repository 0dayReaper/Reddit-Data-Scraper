You\u2019ll eventually figure out the tactics you need to learn to succeed on exams, because knowing the material and knowing you\u2019ll do well on an exam are different. You like it here which is awesome, so my advice is to give it a shot and if you realize its not working out after this year then you think about plan b. You\u2019ve got this man.\n\nAs a side note, I tutor calculus (I\u2019m a physics PhD student here), so if you need help let me know!",

I would also look into taking core classes at a community college (Red Rocks) to help ease you into the subjects if you're struggling this much with the workload.",

I failed many exams throughout my time at Mines, especially freshman year. It took a while to adapt, for sure. Don\u2019t get too discouraged. Reset and focus on the next",

It can be difficult adjusting to the new workload and may seem like you don\u2019t have time for anything else. However taking even an hour away from hw or studying to switch to another assignment or go outside would help out immensely. \n\nThe thing to consider regarding STEM major or not is if what you\u2019re studying is something you will actually be happy doing in life even if it is short term after college, or is there something else you\u2019d rather be working on. You can always take the course incrementally at Red Rocks and transfer back once all the pre-major requirements are knocked out, however if you\u2019re not genuinely enjoying any of your STEM courses then it may help to talk to a counselor to see what they suggest. I know a good number of people who failed Calc one their first semester only to turn it around in the spring now that they were in the groove but starting out it can be troublesome if you don\u2019t already have a system in place to help you.",

It can take a hefty amount of time to adjust to the classes here at mines as they are pretty particular in what they want and are very tricky to get the hang of. Luckily the hang ups of each of the classes have overlaps with each other, so you have figure out just one thing for the others to quickly click into place across the board. Also remember that these grades you get are not at all a reflection of how smart you are. Mines classes just are game that you haven't figured out how to play yet :). Work hard but remember that overworking and over studying are serious dangers to consider. You got this!",

In mathematics especially here at mines I have felt that I know the content but my exam scores never ever reflect it. If you're like me you didn't take AP Calc in high-schooland never had Test heavy curriculum in the past then you have to understand that this school and its mathematics curriculum will set you apart for that fact. Its purposely not designed in our favor. Keep in mind that the first class you fail is considered graced and not considered \"Retaken\" on your transcript. If you like it here at Mines and want to stay, then please do! If you can be resilient and do your best to stay confident then the reflection of a rigged system won't matter to you anymore. \n\nAnd for some tips- tell all to your Calc teacher and make sure they know your past school experiences with math, how your feeling, what's not working for you, etc. That genuineness has gotten me a whole lot of assistance with professors with incompatibility in their teaching style and my learning style, if they know then they are most likely going to work with you.\n\nNext, take really good through notes. Write down everything that's said, everything that's on the board, all of it. This has really work for me so when confused I can go back and emulate the work we did in class until I understand the concept.\n\nAnyway I know people who retook Calc 1 twice and a still motivated to overcome and get a degree here. Don't give up, advocate for yourself and good good luck! Wishing you the best :)",

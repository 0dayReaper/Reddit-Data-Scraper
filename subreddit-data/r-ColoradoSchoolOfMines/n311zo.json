            "comment": "Hey there, I went to Purdue for undergrad and went to Mines for grad school. Here\u2019s a list of observations I\u2019ve made from being in both places:\n\n1) Purdue will give you an unparalleled alumni network and opportunities to get hired at nearly whatever company you want. Mines isn\u2019t bad for that, but it\u2019s a bigger step down from Purdue than you might think.\n\n2) Purdue, being a big school, will give you better offerings outside your major. That means a craaaaazy wide breadth of study abroad options, foreign language classes, electives, services like help for writing fellowship applications, etc. A big school offers big resources. \n\n3)Living in colorado is. So. Much. Better. Than Indiana. Not really sure how much that matters for a horribly busy undergrad. \n\n4)From a culture perspective, I find them actually rather similar. I think you\u2019ll find similar flavors of people at both, but the ratios of numbers of different flavors of people will be a bit different. \n\n5) I think getting lost at a big school thing is sort of a myth in some sense, and in that regard, I don\u2019t think mines and Purdue are that different. You\u2019d more see the difference between a super small place (think Harvey mudd) and somewhere like Purdue. \n\n6)Academic rigor is similar at both. Purdue, with the better job network, is a bit better positioned to immediately turn that into an advantage for you, but I think you\u2019ll know what you are doing more or less equally graduating from either of those universities",

            "comment": "Golden really offers great opportunity for outdoor activities especially being in the mountains. But like the comment about Purdue\u2019s clout etc, that\u2019s hard to turn down too. Mines has plenty of good clout, I know the Electrical engineering department has many students working for big name contractors and companies such as AMD, Intel, Northrop Grumman, and Lockheed Martin, to name a few. But it seems if you\u2019re leaning more aeronautical, Purdue may be a better choice for you as well. \n\nSocial life is easy to come by if you\u2019re social enough. Sure it\u2019s easy to remain within your own shell and whatnot but it\u2019s plenty easy to get to know people around you and find those with common interests. Many students still like to party and do traditional college activities with plenty of really interesting clubs and sports to participate in. E days is essentially one big party for the whole school and joked to be \u201cschool sanctioned drinking\u201d. So while we are often seen as social recluses, I haven\u2019t seen it that way as much as long as you put yourself out there. \n\nMines has a majority of MechE graduates with a rapidly growing compsci department.  ChemE is also big if you find that of interest with plenty of opportunities. We have great connections to the big military contractors if you\u2019d like to dabble in the aeronautical/astronautical space and our statistics for finding a great paying job upon graduation is high. \n\nSomething you should really consider is size. Purdue is a large school compared to Mines. If you want the smaller environment and closer community (not saying that isn\u2019t possible at Purdue but big schools have noticeable impacts) maybe Mines is a better choice. But if you enjoy being at a larger school with greater diversity, perhaps Perdue is for you. I personally believe Mines is a great size as I never feel like I\u2019m running out of people to meet or socially claustrophobic in that sense. But I also am not overwhelmed by a huge campus or ton of students. These decisions come down to personal preference and I hope you make the decision that\u2019s best for you. If you haven\u2019t already, tour each campus if possible. Get a feel for the size of both and how you will fit in one versus the other. Best of luck to you and take care.",

But, Purdue clearly has a lot of money for research, amazing facilities, and lots of majors to choose from. However, your Mines professors will know your name, our cold snaps are tolerable, you can mountain bike and hike between classes, and most of my friends in aerospace jobs have a mechE degree from Mines and got jobs out of school no problem. I\u2019d choose Mines :)",

From what I\u2019ve heard, an aeronautical specific program focuses on modeling, stress analysis, and tolerances expected from that industry. (Like that aerodynamics of a cow meme - that kind of stuff). \n\nIf you\u2019re serious about aerospace/aeronautics, I would do some informational interviews with people in the industry and see what their backgrounds are in. Also depends on what aspect you want to get into - systems integration, part design, flight control, stress analysis, engineer liaison - there\u2019s a huge list for that industry and Colorado is quickly becoming quite the space hub so lots of internship opportunities here too. I think there\u2019s a huge gap between \u201cI want to design airplanes\u201d and what actual aeronautical engineers do and speaking with industry professionals might help you figure out what aspects are appealing to you and help you narrow down a focus.",

Especially since you're not entirely sure what branch of engineering you're down for; Purdue carries more clout in more disciplines than Mines. Without even getting into which school offers a better/tougher education, Purdue's network is very strong. Their alumni hire tf out of each other. And then, frankly, most tier 1 companies (MBB, high tech, most of FAANG, etc.) don't recruit at Mines, whereas Purdue is a target school for almost all of them. I don't know, maybe my impression of Purdue is overly positive, but unless the price difference is really significant, I would lean towards Purdue.

                            "comment": "I'm not familiar with Purdue starting salaries, but the thing to know about Mines is that it's mostly the extraction majors and comp sci that get consistently high salaries, and that's why \"the average Mines grad\" (inclusive of all majors) makes more at start of career. Those majors reeeaally drive up the average. If you look at the salaries by major, you'll see most are fairly unremarkable; median salary for MechE is about 63k. \n\nAs for type of employment (e.g big company, stable job vs small company, growth job), there's not really a pattern. That's entirely up to you. I'm obviously a Mines student, and I've worked for big megacorps, and this summer I'll be interning at a startup. There are Purdue folk at each of these companies. So yeah, the school doesn't really determine the scale of your job.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, Mines is a great school. There have been a few recent threads wherein you can read about how Mines students tend to get internships really early (sophomore and freshman year), and can find employment relatively easily after graduation (not so for many other engineering schools). This has been my experience as well, so I'll say whichever one you choose, you can't go wrong. BUUUUUT, my take: If the mountains vs plains thing is nbd for you, choose Purdue, no question. Purdue has a better reputation, better network, more resources, and will be about $20,000 cheaper, all told (5,000 dollars/year for 4 years).\n\nI recommend you look at Purdue's extracurricular options. I know their undergraduate rocketry and propulsion projects are top notch, and I'm sure they have other projects that are similarly intense. If you can get involved in those early on, you can get great experience working on some really high tech shit in a way that's not really possible here at Mines. While Mines and Purdue folk often end up in the same places, I think Purdue has more resources to get you there.",

If mines has an average starting salary that is higher than Purdue, I would guess it\u2019s because oil and gas represents a bigger piece of the hiring pie at mines. The top end salaries at Purdue tend to go to oil and gas jobs, as well as Silicon Valley and Microsoft. P&amp;G and GE are also known to pay well for those with good GPAs. GE hires a ridiculous number of Purdue grads in particular. Boeing also likes our aeros, but because all the aeros want that job, it can be better to go through MechE or ECE to get a job with them. SpaceX also hires like crazy from Purdue and pays well, although you might burn out there pretty fast. On top of that, people with higher GPAs (3.5+) are more or less guaranteed a starting salary above 70K for most engineering majors if they want it. Purdue also has decent start up connections if that\u2019s more your cup of tea. I can\u2019t speak to mines as much.",

            "comment": "I got my bachelors in engineering physics from Mines in 2010. I got my masters in electrical/computer engineering from Purdue online in 2018. I did visit campus twice through my masters.\n\nIn terms of the education, both schools are\ntop tier in terms of having teachers that know how to teach their topic. Purdue is very much a more recognized school in more fields and gets a lot more attention from Fortune 500 companies than Mines. Mines is the \u201cHarvard of the oil industry\u201d but outside of oil, gas, and mining it is known, but not as strongly and doesn\u2019t have as much of an alumni network as within the natural resources industries. Mines is better known in the West and in Texas so if you plan on living in those places, you should be fine, but it is unheard of back East while Purdue has national recognition.\n\nOutside of school, mines is a small school in a very beautiful location. It is very easy to have a mostly walking/biking life through college and small gatherings are always going down. Sports exist but really don\u2019t impact college life. Purdue was definitely the more traditional campus with a quad and beautiful buildings, but it is in the Midwest and not as many opportunities for outdoor activities. Sports are a much bigger deal at Purdue and do impact campus life. Purdue also gets much bigger acts and shows, music and fine arts and comedy, than mines does, if that\u2019s something of interest. Mines does punch well above its weight class for the Edays band, but not as consistently throughout the year.\n\nOne thing I will comment on, I did a fully remote degree from Purdue from 2013 to 2018. Many of my classes were a live in person lecture with students that was webcast/video taped and made available for online viewing/download. Given this last year and college, Purdue knows how to do a hybrid or remote class really well. The instructors know the tools and the systems and how to interact. They were figuring this out before anyone else. I am uncertain how well mines handled all off this, but more current students might be able to chime in on how well that worked out and if the school is going to continue to use the new opportunities.\n\nI would also compare and consider tuition costs between them, if you qualify for in-state for either, as well as if either works well with transferring in from a community college. Mines really tries to not have credits transfer in, but I don\u2019t know how Purdue does that, if you are interested in that.",

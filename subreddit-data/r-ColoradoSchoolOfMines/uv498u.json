    "postText": "Hello!\n\nFor those that have taken CSCI Programming challenges,\n\n1) Has anyone found them to be useful? I am very tempted to take the first programming challenge 1 because I would like to have more experience in coding technical interviews.\n\n2) What did you find useful in it and what did you hate about it?\n\n3) Is this class a waste of time? I am trying to become a software engineer in the coming years and I would to know if these classes actually benefit me.",

However, programming challenges 2 is being offered in the fall and pc1 is not a prereq for it. I have not taken the classes so I do not know how useful they are yet, but I intend to. I didn't take 1, but I'm signed up for 2 in the fall. There is concern about how it will count towards my CS degree because I believe you need all 3 for it to count as a CS elective. Personally regardless of whether the credits count for anything I am very interested in the programming problems / competitive programming. I know nothing about how useful it will be, but I expect it to be interesting at least.",

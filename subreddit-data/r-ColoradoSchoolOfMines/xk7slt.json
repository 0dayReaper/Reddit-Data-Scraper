    "postText": "Hi guys, I am applying for admission in the next cycle for MEE program. The \"pre-requisite requirement\" is a bit confusing. Do I have to have the 3 pre-reqs (  **Calculus 1; Introductory Probability and Statistics; and Principles of Microeconomics)** already from undergrad or will they allow us to take it in the first sem? I know it says we have to have it already, in which case, are there any ways around it and/or what is the best option? THanks.",

Should I enroll in another program at Mines first, get those 2 courses sorted out, and then apply for MEE?",

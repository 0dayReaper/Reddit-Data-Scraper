Mines has some hard classes man.\n\nEdit: To compare how easy stuff is, I would say that like Calc1 can be compared to learning how to ride a bike, fairly simple. Diff Eq is like skydiving without training.",

There were some classes that came easily for me and not for other students, while other classes were extremely difficult for me and easy to others. There's no universally difficult classes in my opinion. It's all very specific to the individual student.",

Personally, I found Calc 3 to be the easiest (I didn't take Calc 1 at mines), and Linear Algebra was the hardest. Diff EQ was pretty hard also, but I took that over the summer when 90% of my friends had gone home so I had way less distractions than I did during the year.\n\nPhysics 1/2 are a little tricky if you've only done algebra-based physics before and this is your first time doing calculus-based physics. The homework load can be a lot sometimes, especially with their penchant for \"conceptual\" problems. Protip: This is a *great* class to make a habit of going to your professors' office hours and working on your homework there.\n\nI took intro to Thermodynamics from a man named Matt Liberatore. People called him \"The Liberator\" because after one class with him you'd change your major. *That* was an annoying class, but it was also weird for me because I was a physics major and that was a ChemE class (physics curriculum changed so that's not longer a requirement). The Liberator definitely treated physics students in his class differently than ChemE students.\n\nI know a lot of upper-level MechE classes (notably Machine Design) have a reputation for being \"pretty hard, but just an ungodly amount of work to complete\".",

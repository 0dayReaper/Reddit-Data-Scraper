We will be able to swing about 25k a year. She does full time Running Start and will graduate h.s. with her AS with a CS emphasis.",

            "comment": "My biggest recommendation would be apply as early as possible. When I applied early Mines offered me three merit scholarships compared to my friend (who was honestly slightly more competitive than I was, he had more leadership and a higher GPA) who got waitlisted and no merit scholarships. Also if your daughter is in state for CO have her apply for the Caldwell scholarship, or the vanguard scholarship society if she is out of state! Feel free to DM if you have any questions.",

            "comment": "In my experience- they won\u2019t give much in terms of merit aid/scholarships. Your best bet is getting external Scholarships. I go to the financial aid office at least once a year and they just tell me to check for external scholarships\n\nPretty much everyone out of state gets 8-15k per year in \u201cmerit scholarship\u201d via the \u201cprovost award\u201d. I\u2019m not sure exactly what influences this amount though. The earlier you apply though, the sooner you\u2019ll know your amount, and then you\u2019ll know how much you have to raise from externals.\n\nAlso of note- the first year cost is substantially more than subsequent years. I think the room+board+food was $20k alone. That\u2019s a cost that can (and probably will) get cut by around $10k for the years after freshman",

As an out of state person (also female), I first got merit scholarships based on my high school GPA and ACT score. I also ended up serendipitously being awarded a few scholarships from generous alumni donors (through the Mines Foundation) such that I graduated with less than $30k in student loans after graduating in 4 years. Most of the qualifications for the Mines Foundation scholarships were based on intersectionality (e.g., female, OOS, community participation, athletics, etc.); get involved and demonstrate involvement in many holistic ways!",

Generally she\u2019ll need SAT/ACT scores and a gpa in the top 25% of Mines incoming classes, these stats are findable on the admissions website iirc or the Common Data Set. Showing interest in Mines is also helpful, try to get a tour in or at least some online info sessions. Having leadership positions and good involvement in high school activities also helps. Fill out all the essays, even if they\u2019re optional. Get the application in early. Also, I\u2019m not sure if your daughter will be eligible but there\u2019s set to be a new scholarship program called Hearst scholars, which will be for Community College transfer students. best of luck to your daughter in this process!",

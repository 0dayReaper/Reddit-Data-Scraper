    "postText": "Hello everyone. I know current students are probably tired of prospective students flooding this subreddit with questions, so I apologize for this post.\n\nI visited the campus a couple of weeks ago but didn't get to talk to anyone from my current major of interest - chemical engineering. As such, I was wondering if any current or former students could give me some insight into the best and worst parts of chemE at Mines. \n\nAny input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",

It\u2019s way less chemistry than you\u2019d think based on the name lol. \n\nI graduated ChemE with a minor in CS 2017, ChemE job prospects are (mostly) oil and gas, large scale production facilities (P&amp;G chemicals for example), or parlaying into \u2018process engineering\u2019 outside of the chemical/oil and gas realm - but that\u2019s rare IMO. I went straight into software and never left, but feel free to ask any questions about ChemE you want - I can give you slightly dated answers.",

The other option I was considering is going into materials and interfaces development with a biotech focus since I already have lab experience in that kind of field.\n\nHowever, I currently am not sure how feasible either of those options are.",

I took CBEN315 (might have been called something else back then, but it was basically renewable energy with a fuel cells focus) and it was great. The other basic principles of chemical engineering will apply heavily to renewable energy production, but to really get an idea of how specialized you can get you should just email people at Mines and NREL. The most important thing I learned in college and while entering the workforce is: people want to help. Its scary to ask for help, but its so nice to be on the other end of someone asking for help. Be polite, be brief, and ask \"hey I want to get into &lt;this&gt;, I think combining ChemE with this [sustainable energy focus](https://www.mines.edu/sustainable-energy/) is a cool way to do that, is that feasible/realistic/recommended or is there another better way to get into the renewable energy production field through a degree at Mines?\". Also break up into not one long run-on sentence lol.\n\nIt can literally 3 sentences - just email a few people separately that are involved in ChemE, the Renewable Energy focus, and NREL and I'm sure a few will respond and want to help. If you're local they'd probably even sit down to coffee with you and help guide you. People like to help, you just have to ask and be polite. Good luck!\n\nEDIT: also - people will say ChemE is crazy hard and don't do it and blah blah but IMO its not any more difficult than the rest of the majors at Mines. The classes and professions are great, I would absolutely recommend it, as long as you know what field you want to get into with it and how it applies.",

But there's a feeling of accomplishment as you complete each course. \nI know that's pretty generic advice but I think it definitely applies to chemical engineering. \n\nOur faculty is also pretty solid. Most professors are tough but fair and I've found that they always have a ton of office hours for major specific courses. \n\nStarting salaries are usually pretty nice, depends on your field though too.",

But I will say that I\u2019ve met a lot of amazing, driven ppl who I\u2019m glad to call my peers/friends. I\u2019ve known 2 ppl so far who\u2019ve switched to other majors from ChemE but I would say once you get past the intro sophomore level classes people tend to settle into the major. Once you take your first thermo class I think you\u2019ll know if ChemE is right for you.  I chose ChemE because I liked chemistry in hs and I can\u2019t say it is NOTHING like that haha. But I ended up liking my thermo class and I\u2019m also looking to work in renewable energy and our major has some great connections at NREL.",

I\u2019m sure they\u2019re out there, but everyone I\u2019ve know has switched majors. Whether that\u2019s because of conflict of interest or how difficult the major is, I have no idea. A lot of people say it\u2019s one of the more difficult ones on campus. The chem department in general is annoying at best to deal with from my experience in chem 1/2, but maybe that\u2019s different in upper chem classes.\n\nHowever, you probably shouldn\u2019t be asking this sub for advice. You should email the department and ask your questions, they can likely put you in contact with a current student who know what they\u2019re actually talking about. As well, freshmen don\u2019t declare majors until the end of their first year (and you can switch fairly easily until mid/late second year) so don\u2019t feel like you have to find everything out or decide definitively right now. There is time to feel out the major and department before committing to them.",

I remember liking that everyone on campus knew we had one of the toughest field sessions. Currently a process engineer and I feel like the philosophy is applicable although not all the petroleum classes I took as electives. If I have any advice, make close chemE friends because some of the course work is better understood with some discussion and you need a support system for when you fail a test or something. Making those relationships was the biggest pro for me.",

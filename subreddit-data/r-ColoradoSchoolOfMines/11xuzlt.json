            "comment": "Big tech will target these more prestigious schools for graduates as most of their employees came from those schools. Big tech has disproportionately large salaries (upwards of 150k to 200k starting). The companies that hire CS majors from mines are smaller, but offer solid careers. Also that figure lacks context, as the jobs that typically offer salaries that high are in high cost of living areas. According to an online calculator I just found, a salary of 130k in San Francisco is equivalent to a 77k salary in Denver.",

There may be CoL factors as well; if most MIT grads are going to Boston, NYC, or SF, then yeah they're going to have higher salaries just based on location alone. But that's mostly cope: Mines compsci isn't anywhere neeeeeeaaaar the league of MIT compsci.",

You will only use 'hardcore CS concepts' in Leetcode interviews and less than once a year writing a new algorithm, so IMO its not all that important. Go to the school you want to go to based on location, activities, price, etc - not based on program prestige. If you want a MAANG job plenty of Mines grads go that direction and you can too.",

Mines grads are much more likely to be working in Colorado, or the middle of the country than MIT grads are.   \nCost of living there is higher, so salaries are higher.   \n\n\nBut in addition to that, Mines isn't exactly known as a CompSci school.  It's an Energy and Earth school.  MIT compsci grads work predominantly at FAANG. Mines Compsci grads predominantly work at companies you haven't heard of.",

I can\u2019t attest to whether or not the Comp Sci department at Mines is good or not, but my experience in the mandatory 101/102 class was not the best. I would also bet my savings that MIT\u2019s department is much better than Mines. I\u2019m sure you can ask any of the numerous comp sci majors at Mines and they would be willing to give you an earful about the department.",

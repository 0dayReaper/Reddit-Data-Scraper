    "postText": "So I have received a provisional offer to spend my second year abroad at Mines (currently studying in Scotland) which is really exciting\n\nBut one big issue I've come across is the seemingly insane cost of student accomadation over there. \n\nThe cheapest option I've come across so far comes to \u00a3600 per month which isn't really affordable for me.\n\nAm I missing something and are there cheaper options on campus, or alternatively would it be easy for me to find a private place to rent in Golden for a reasonable price? Being able to meet people is extremely important to me too so I need to keep that in mind\n\nAny advice would be much appreciated!",

Unfortunately Colorado housing is quite expensive and the closer you get to the center of Golden or the center of Denver the more expensive it will probably be. Trust me, we are all aware of the high housing costs. Your options will exponentially increase if you will have personal transportation (car, motorcycle) or if you are willing to take the bus (aka add 25 minutes to any commute you have). This will let you live in a city near Golden like Lakewood, where housing will either be cheaper or better for the same price. \n\nIf meeting people is crazy important to you than the dorms are the best option for that. Personally I disliked living in the dorms for a whole year but I lived in the traditional halls which I would not recommend to anyone, you might have a better time in one of the newer buildings though. I think you'll still be able to meet enough people by attending events around campus and joining clubs, even if you don't live on campus.\n\nPeople at Mines tend to have large social circles of acquaintances but only a small circle of close friends (in my experience). Gotta meet the best ones and then siphon all the goodness they have ;).\n\nGood luck with finding housing, if you aren't able to find someone who needs a roommate I recommend using Craigslist or Zillow.",

            "comment": "I would recommend staying on campus, I am an international student myself and I have spent a year trying to find a decent place on my own. It should be easier if you\u2019re willing to have roommates, it just took so long for me because I wanted to live alone. But to get a place for just yourself, it\u2019s insanely hard for an international student because it\u2019s not common to have an income and/or SSN and not many have a rich family member in the US who can be a guarantor. You could pass the financial requirements problem if you make more than 2x to 3x rent in your home country and will be making even when you\u2019re here, or you have more than 2.5x to 3x annual rent in your bank. Also, not having an SSN means no credit score and more difficult background check for the landlord.\n\nSure, living off-campus can be cheaper, but if you don\u2019t want to buy a car and don\u2019t have the ability to meet the financial requirements... it would be easier for you to just pay the money and stay on campus.",

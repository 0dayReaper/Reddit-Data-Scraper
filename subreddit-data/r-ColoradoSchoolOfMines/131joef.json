            "comment": "Don't stress out about it. Some folks get lucky and hit an internship on the first try, others just don't get any bites. What year are you in school?\n\nI would highly recommend thinking about why you're trying to get an internship. It's all about building up your resume to show that you're a good hire to potential employers. I'm not sure what area you're studying, but think about jobs that aren't specifically engineering but would still look good on a resume. Can you get a position working in a fab shop, maybe something that supports a supply chain, programming, honestly anything that you can connect to your long term goals. \n\nIf that doesn't work out, then you could look into volunteering. Maybe you can work on habitat for humanity homes over the summer, service wheelchairs for the less fortunate, or go on a service trip domestically or intentionally. I realize some of these ideas may be limited by your financial situation.\n\nThe last option is getting a job just to pay the bills and starting up a 'company' where you work on a product that you think would be a great taking point in an interview. Maybe you develop something you've been passionate about for years, maybe you partner with someone that already has an idea, or maybe the whole purpose is to gain another skill (app development, sensing and actuation, circuit board fab, etc...). \n\nAs crappy as it may sound, sometimes stuff like this can be hard in the short term but amazing for your career long term.\n\nI'm happy to chat if you're feeling down. Situations like this don't define you, it's how you react. How do you want to look back on this situation in 10 years? \n\nYOU GOT THIS!",

Internships are great, but not the end-all-be-all.\n\nAlso, you said you're a senior. Don't apply to internships, apply to entry-level jobs. You're qualified, I promise.",

I didn\u2019t recieve any notifications from the school after I have completed it. I also haven\u2019t heard anything back from them at all. I was wondering, was I suppose to be notified for it? I\u2019m genuinely panicking abt this because idk if I have done the things correctly\u2026 Does anyone has an answer for me in this group??",

You should receive one on your mines email on outlook. If not you can email nest@mines.edu to check your confirmation. Let me know if you have anymore issues.",

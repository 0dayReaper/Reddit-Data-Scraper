This makes it easier to coordinate with eachother and choose the same room to share.\n\nIf you weren't in a roommate group, you would still have a timeslot and choose a room; however, if you have empty spots in your room, anyone could come along and decide to be your roommate. But you should've created a profile of sorts while filling out the process for housing, which people can use to decide to be your roommate or not.",

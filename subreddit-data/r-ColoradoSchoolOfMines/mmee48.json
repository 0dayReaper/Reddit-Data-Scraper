    "postText": "I'm a MechE, and according to the last outcomes report put out by Mines, the median salary for MechEs after graduation is about $68,000. Not terrible; can only go up from there, and anyway I love the work!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBUUUUUUT on every one of these outcome reports, the highest reported salary for MechEs out of school is ridiculously high; usually around $140,000. Does anyone know how a fresh ME grad could get such a high salary? I imagine it would be:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-They got a job in finance, management consulting, etc with high salaries and lots of overtime.\n\n\\-\"Joining the family business\" kind of deal.\n\n\\-An old-timer who was already making a lot, and just wanted/needed to get the degree to promote.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don't know. Any ideas?",

It\u2019s not un heard of for quants/entry level developers at Jane Street and other financial services companies to be making that much money fresh out of school. Unfortunately no one who i personally know has been in that situation.",

From speaking to MEs at work, it sounds like developing (employable) proficiency in FEA and/or thermal stuff can be lucrative, but like...80-90k lucrative. 140k seems like PhD-levels of compensation to me. Would love to hear if you have anymore to share about specialization at the undergrad level!",

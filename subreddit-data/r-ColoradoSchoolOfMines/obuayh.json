Professional societies, cultural clubs, sports and outdoors, the arts, fantasy-based, etc.  If you\u2019re a new student I\u2019d highly recommend checking out the Virtual Celebration of Mines on canvas and coming to CoM the first Friday of the year.  If not, engage is a good tool to check out:  https://mines.campuslabs.com/engage/ .  Be aware though, I\u2019m not sure if engage gets updated throughly and there may be defunct clubs listed!",

During my undergrad I know several club sports teams were added, one professional society club for my major, and countless fun activity/culture clubs. Hope you find some you\u2019re interested in! :)",

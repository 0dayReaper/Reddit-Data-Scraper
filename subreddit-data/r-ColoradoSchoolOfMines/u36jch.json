    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am transferring into mines this fall and am trying to figure out my housing. I\u2019ve been on mineslist to see if any leases are available, but haven\u2019t gotten any luck. Does anyone have any ideas on how I can find housing with good roommates?\n\nIf anyone here is looking for a roommate, I\u2019m a 21 year old male who is active and likes to climb, cook and just hangout. I\u2019m rather easy going and just looking for a good place to stay. I\u2019m also a MME major.",

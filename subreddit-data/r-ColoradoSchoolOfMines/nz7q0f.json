I was suspended the summer after my sophomore year, due to personal reasons I became depressed and could not keep up with my grades. I was in a 7 year dental program where after 3 years I was supposed to transfer to the state dental school and become a dentist. Unfortunately after my suspension I was also dismissed from my program. \n\nI got an email saying I was suspended for 12 months and afterwards I can reapply for consideration ... my school also has a fresh start program where if you return after one year with 12 credits at a county college with 2.5 gpa or better, or an associates degree, they will take out up to 30 failed credits from you gpa (the grades are still on transcript just not factored into gpa).\n\nSo I went to my local county college and did my associates in 11 months (close to 50 credits) and graduated with high honors. It was extremely hard! I\u2019m about to graduate with my bachelors in December and will be starting NP school to specialize in psychiatry. \n\nLessons: I know your future life trajectory seems very muddled right now but I promise you if you keep going then opportunities will open up for you. Trust me. \n\nPM me personally if you have any questions or need some guidance",

    "postText": "I graduated with a Bachelors in ME a couple years back and have been working in the medical device industry since. I moved to Colorado this summer and I've been applying to NREL like crazy. The work they do there is SO interesting to me! Based on my initial searches it seems pretty much impossible to get in there without some amount of upper education and applied research. I'm not sure if I would go for mechanical or materials (I minored in materials) but I think that mechanical with a specific focus is likely the best bet.\n\nI'm thinking a thesis program that could give me research experience and a good route into NREL. I've heard that these are mostly funded. Have any of you followed this route and had luck working with NREL or on similar research after graduation? I reached out to a couple professors that work with NREL a few days ago but I'm not optimistic about hearing back. \n\nWhat have your experiences been like getting a Masters at Mines with a focus on research and renewables, fuel cells, heat transfer, etc?",

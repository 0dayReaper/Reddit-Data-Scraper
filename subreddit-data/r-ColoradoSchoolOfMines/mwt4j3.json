            "comment": "Depends.\n\nI've seen a lot of the entry-level classes kick your butt. If your son has taken AP/IB equivalents of those classes (Calc 1, 2, Phys 1,2, Chem 1,2) and is familiar with the material or already has credit for them, then it's a lot easier to hold a 3.0. I can't say anything about most majors but it also really depends on your major. For example, our ChemE program is notoriously difficult, while a lot of majors have more manageable workloads. \n\nIf it was difficult for him to get a 3.0 or 3.5 in high school then it'll be tough, but if he breezed through HS with a 3.5 or 4.0 then it'll be completely doable as long as you're on top of work to not fall behind.",

I would definitely not recommend doing 18-21 credit hours a semester in order to graduate on-time/early; sticking with 12-15 credit hours and going an extra semester are pretty common here, and alleviate some of the workload of the other semesters. I graduated with a 3.5 for my chemistry degree this way, without constantly pulling all-nighters. I did transfer from out of state, but those few transfer credits didn\u2019t count towards my GPA.",

It hasn\u2019t been easy; while most classes it\u2019s not difficult to get at least a B, there are some classes that can wreck your GPA (Physics 1,2, MechE Thermo 1, Machine Design, Heat Transfer, coming from a MechE of course). Obviously every class requires commitment and time management to get all the homework and projects done but as far as 3.0s go it\u2019s perfectly possible. My personal experience though is that I have tried as hard as I can and still can\u2019t push past a 3.2.",

I went to class maybe twice a week for a good half of high school, got mostly 5\u2019s on AP exams, and finished second in my class with a gpa of 4.3. I didn\u2019t study, ever, and was the copy editor of the newspaper, ran varsity cross country, participated in the national honors society, and was president of the national art honors society. Since coming to Mines, I\u2019m over the moon to get a B in chem e classes and really struggling to maintain a 3.0. It all depends on the major, but if scholarships are requiring 3.0 I wouldn\u2019t suggest chem e.",

However, I am a Computer Science major who came in with a classes of AP credit so I haven\u2019t had to take 18 hour semesters.\n\nI am not the greatest student, either. I often put off homework to hang out with my friends or work on personal projects, but I still make 99% of my deadlines because I know the work will start piling up quickly if I get behind.\n\nIn general, my experience (and others\u2019 who I have talked with) is that if you stay on top of your work and have a solid support system (I.e acquaintances, clubs, etc.) with people who can help you out, you\u2019ll be golden.",

            "comment": "One thing to account for is the highschool college transition. Myself and a fair amount fo others I know did really well with minimal effort in high school, and ran headlong into a wall when we got here because we didn't have the skills needed to do well in classes that were legitimately hard for us.\n\nBeing able to study hard for exams is a skill some incoming students lack, and it can be HARD to ask for help. It can feel like a failure to need to go to a professor for help. But it isn't.\n\nI think he will absolutely be capable of getting a 3.0 if he knows when to ask for help. But make sure he knows that if it doesn't happen the first year, that doesn't mean he's screwed and it doesn't mean he doesn't belong here.\n\nScholarships can also be appealed. I know several people who did exactly that. Whether their meds weren't right, they struggled with mental health, had a hard transition, whatever. If you can show them a reason you're likely to do better going forward, they'll usually grant you another year of scholarship.",

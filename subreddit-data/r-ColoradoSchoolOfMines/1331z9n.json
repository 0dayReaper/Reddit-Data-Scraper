I\u2019m a student who\u2019s going to be attending the CS@Mines MS CS Bridge Program starting this upcoming fall, and I\u2019m curious if anyone here can answer a question I have regarding program scholarships. I\u2019ve only been able to find vague hints to \u201csmall scholarships\u201d being given out, so are there any students here who did the Bridge program and can answer as to how much these \u201csmall scholarships\u201d actually are?",

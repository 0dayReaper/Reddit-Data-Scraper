    "postText": "Hello, \n\nI'm a new international student at the HCC Central Campus. I'm looking for on-campus positions to improve my financial situation. I have applied for jobs through the HCC CareerHub, talked to the International Student Office and have spoken with advisors regarding jobs. However, this has led nowhere. I have a few positions I've applied for already but haven't heard anything back. I have my resume ready and am willing to work as soon as possible. If you know about any job openings or could help me find a job or help push my resume through anywhere at all, please let me know. It's difficult as an international student to understand what exactly I'm supposed to do. I could use any help I can get. Thank you very much!",

            "comment": "Hi there ,\n\nIt looks like you already did a good job of setting yourself up, now you just have to be patient. \nMost HCC positions available to students are funded through work study, and since you are F1- unfortunately you are unable to apply for those positions. That leaves part- time positions which are very limited and coveted by all students (not just International students.)\nYour best bet is to continue applying and networking. Build relationships with people at HCC,bc when a job does becomes available - they always prefer students who they know will do a good job. \nGood luck!",

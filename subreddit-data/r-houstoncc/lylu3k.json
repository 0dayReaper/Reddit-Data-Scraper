    "postText": "Hello! I  recently signed up to take Microeconomics (second 8 weeks) online with Stephanie Willis and I'm wondering about the pace of the class. I've taken an 8 weeks course before for Chem I  and it was fine overall. I don't know much about the professor and how they assign material so that's something I'm a little worried about. Has anyone ever taken an econ course with her?",

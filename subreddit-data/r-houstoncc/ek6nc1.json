I just don't get it as the system over in Ireland is it's just one big campus or different campuses for different programs. I read somewhere that you can choose your campus in HCC. Does that mean if I'm doing engineering, I can just choose any campus to study at? Or is it similar in that some campuses don't offer the program? Thanks",

Workforce programs such as cosmetology, auto etc. are only located at special campuses because the equipment is all located there. \nIf you are planning on taking core courses for engineering to transfer to a university, you will be able to take those courses at any HCC campus (as long as they are teaching the course there.) You can mix and match campuses as well.\nHCC- Alief Hayes, however, is usually considered the hub for engineering because it houses some of the partnerships like HCC and UT Tyler or Texas A&amp;M. But once again, it does not mean you have to take your courses there.",

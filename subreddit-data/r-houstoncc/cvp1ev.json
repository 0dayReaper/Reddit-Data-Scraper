    "postText": "Has anyone purchased a laptop from HCC and can tell me how the laptops/computers sold by HCC compare to laptops/computers you purchase direct from the seller or from a electronic store? They seem to be bottom rung based on the specs I've seen. I need one that will last me a couple years, or at least until I get to UT Austin or A&amp;M to finish out my mechanical engineering degree (which means I'm going to need a pretty powerful computer at some point...) Are they worth the money??",

            "comment": "I had researched the laptops from HCC and I agree, they are low rung.  When purchaseing a laptop you generally want one that costs initially over 1k because it will last longer than one under.  I would recommend asus or me I over hp or Dell.  Microcenter generally has those brands.",

You're right about the higher quality; but with gaming laptops you are spending a lot of money for the advanced graphics (and the cooling they need), which is a waste if you don't need it.\n\nWhat you should look at are \\*business class\\* laptops. Those are built to the higher standard of quality and have the balanced feature set that's most useful for college work. The Thinkpad T series or Dell Latitudes or Precisions are examples.\n\nIIRC, you can get a student discount from Dell (and maybe Lenovo) even if you don't buy through the bookstore.",

There products are cheap, faulty, and designed with forced obsolescence in mind.  No name brands like cyberpower and falcon northwest are companies I would recommend.  As for parts companies that sell laptops:  Asus, msi, even Sony are better quality than you can get from \"Name Brands\",   but everyone has an opinion.",

Check out places like Microcenter and even Best Buy.  Also, many companies like Dell, Apple, and Lenovo offer student discounts. Your proof for being a student is your student email address which is Wnumber@student.hccs.edu.",

            "comment": "If you are going into mechanical engineering, then you might want to look into \"workstation class\" laptops, like the Lenovo P series Thinkpads or the Dell Precisions.\n\nThey are designed for general high performance and use with engineering graphics software. Basically they resemble gaming laptops, but the graphics are intended for maximum compatibility and performance with things like Autocad or Solidworks. They can also drive 4K external monitors easily.\n\nNote that most good \"business class\" laptops will still run engineering software just fine. My engineering classmates seem to do fine with quality general purpose laptops. I've noticed that a lot seem to enjoy the convertible types that let them take notes by hand.",

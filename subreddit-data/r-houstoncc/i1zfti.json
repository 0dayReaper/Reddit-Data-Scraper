    "postText": "Hello y'all\n\nI took classes at hcc online this summer, and I still would like take maybe 1 or 2 courses in fall semester,  but the system won't let me to enroll in any classes before I declare a major, I followed the instruction till it let me fill a form named \u201c Request to Declare or Change Your Major \u201d\uff0c I filled the form but have no idea where do I submit it to, cuz I don't even have an assigned adviser when I login to my student portal. Also one of my friends says I have to find my assigned adviser to get a enroll plan so I can then register for classes for the fall semester, is this true? I'm so confused right now.",

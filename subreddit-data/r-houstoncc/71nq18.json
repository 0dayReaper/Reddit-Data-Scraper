    "postText": " I am from the Northwest Honors College, I cannot take the Regular Start CHEM 1411 for some reason. I desperately needed to have this class. So I talked to the Chairs of Science Department at Spring Branch campus and he said he is going to open another Second Start Chemistry 1411 class as long as there are ten students or more willing to enroll. The class is gonna be on Monday and Wednesday from 2 pm to 6 pm. So far I have gathered 6 but we still need a lot more to fill up the spaces before 25/9. If anyone interested, please leave name and email in the comment. Thank you so much!",

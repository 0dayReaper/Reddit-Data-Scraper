    "postText": "I am sure a lot of you are aware of HCC's presence in the middle east, nothing new there and not entirely unusual for an American higher education instituation to be there. You have a good number of US university with campus abroad. Texas A&amp;M has one, and so does Carnegie, Cornell, and Georgetown and a couple more. Each university oversees a specific college in Education City which is located near Doha, the capital of Qatar. For example, A&amp;M has engineering, Northwestern has journalism and Cornell has medical. They offer an American education and American degree in a foreign place. (Those that attend, who btw come from many places around the middle east, and complete a program earn their respictive degree - however, that degree is the same one you'd get if you'd studied here in the US. There is not distinction on them. It won't read \"Texas A&amp;M University at Qatar\" just \"Texas A&amp;M University\") Each of these campuses are located around each other - just like colleges on a university campus. \n\nHowever, HCC is not. What is unusual is all of the other institutions offer Bachelor degree (and higher). HCC only offers an Associates and it's not located in Education City and it's nowhere near it. It's actually in Doha. Which is odd last time I checked online and views it on Google maps when I was researching the city prior to studying abroad and visiting. \n\nSo my question is: those this campus still exist? does it actually exist and operate? who runs it and what are the funds funding it composed of? \n\nHas anyone ever attended or was in the process of going through it? What was the experience?\n\nDo you know more about this matter? Any legal/questionable matters?\n\nI recall encountering a site detailing HCC in Qatar which brought into question the purpose of it and other financial information. ",

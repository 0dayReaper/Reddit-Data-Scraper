    "postText": "Hi so I\u2019ve recently been trying to figure out what to do for college and major wise for the past couple months and honestly its really been putting me out of my comfort zone and making me doing things i\u2019ve never thought I would do. To clarify, I want to major in Mechanical Engineering with the goal of attending a&amp;m university. I applied to 3 schools ( UH, Colorado Boulder, and a&amp;m) and i ended up getting into all the colleges except a&amp;m ( for MEEN), i was very saddened to hear this and I later realized I was accepted into the Engineering school but I sent in my application to late... big bummer. \n\nAnyways, I could go to UH and transfer but I emailed an A&amp;M Engineer Recruiter and he recommends that instead of transferring from UH to A&amp;M , I would enroll in HCC and Work with A&amp;M\u2019s Chevron Engineering program, here at HCC Houston. Now with going to HCC, I can potential save thousands of college dollars and essentially ( according to the Chevron Guide lines ) I can be guaranteed a spot for my determined major. This is contrastingly very different from UH\u2019s method , where It would be way more competitive. \n\nSo with the other problem that I was also going to have to hustle and pay for college. It seemed obvious to go with the HCC side. So I apply. And... im 17 , technically I see myself as still a kid. I want to experience college... I want to create new memories but I dont know if HCC has that type of life. And I dont intend to stay at HCC either, im trying take my classes and transfer out to College station. \n\nSo my question is as follows. \n\u2022 What is Social life at HCC? My objective here is to take and pass as many classes as possible ( I have lined up AP Class Credits so im hoping to knockout a couple of core basic classes) but maybe im thinking of this as a personal problem? But just curious for insight\n\n\u2022 is this the best route possible? I\u2019ve done a bunch of research and to my knowledge I feel as though this may be the most beneficial path in the long run. \n\n\u2022 For anyone that has gone through my Route, any suggestions and advice?? Kind of alone out here \n\u2022 class environment? \n\n\u2022 is course material hard at HCC? For a student who mainly took AP Classes at a fairly great and competitive School? \n\nThank you for anyone that\u2019s willing to leave ANY suggestions.",

I also have a couple AP Credits that I may be able to transfer and would that be beneficial with our route? Like if I have a AB Calculus Credit, are they going to make me retake calc at hcc? Or Chevron? Or will I just be jumped into Calc II? And I am reading up and I see that you do actually get to go to Cstat and is it almost like you\u2019re an actual a&amp;m student? Or do you feel almost alienated? Or out of place? Just curious... however, I do hear that you get the same \u201c connections\u201d you would get at a&amp;m while also doing chevron and if you dont mind, what advice would you give for someone like me who is just getting into the program, to expect? Like if you were an incoming freshmen now, what would you have wished to know or did to better set yourself up for success. Let me know if you can help me out with these questions thank you.",

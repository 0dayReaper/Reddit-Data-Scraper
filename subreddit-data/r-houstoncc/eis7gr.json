Wondering if anyone else is dealing with this and have found workarounds, since it's rather time sensitive for her at the moment.\n\nTried clearing cache, turning off VPN, launching in incognito, different link routes. Nothing works.\n\nFYI: I'd try edge or explorer but I have no access to those at the moment.",

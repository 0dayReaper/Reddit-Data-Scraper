    "postText": "Hi everyone,   I recently took 3 classes (ECON 2301, MATH 2413 (retake with a B with the last class), and MATH 2415). I just got an email saying i got dropped because non-payment which I chose to pay with summer financial aid, and when I check my summer financial aid it all disappeared. I've sent an email to the financial aid office. Currently I'm picking those same classes and saw that the balance of went up by about $200. Is it because the system consider me as retaking the Math 2413 for the third time and charge and extra (but in fact it's only the second time I take it) ? Thank you in advance!",

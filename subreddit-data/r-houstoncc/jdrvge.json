    "postText": "I\u2019ve been fighting a DWI case in NC for the past few years. The judge has now issued a second bench warrant for my arrest (first was because I didn\u2019t receive the letter to appear in court because I moved out of state, second because my lawyer keeps pushing the court date back). My lawyer and I are actively working on the case, COVID has made getting a court date even harder. \n\nI can\u2019t find any information on their site, they only talk about background checks for employment. I know most universities do background checks. \n\nAny information would be greatly appreciated.",

    "postText": "So multiple classes of mine were dropped these past few days for the fall 2020 semester, and I received an email about it and was told since I enrolled early and now these changes are happening, I get priority enrollment like others that did the same. It started today at 12:01 am and when I go to try to enroll in the classes I lost, nothing comes up if I choose the location I want to go to (southwest campus- west loop). But if I don\u2019t choose a location, it gives me choices and sometimes over 50 choices. \n\nDoes anyone know how to work this enrollment with these new changes with the online anytime, flex campus and whatever the other two are? I was reading on hcc website it saying something about codes like FC and WV or something for which option of the 4 you\u2019d want to choose but I don\u2019t know how to work it or where to put that code in. Anyone having any luck??",

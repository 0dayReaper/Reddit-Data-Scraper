The HCC website tell me to simply \"send the email to admissions@hcc.edu\", but I don't know if that means to simply send a PDF of the transcript I have with me or something else entirely.\n\nIf I could please have someone respond before the 24th, that would be extremely helpful, and thank you in advance!",

I had to go down to the hcc campus and give it to the registrar but I\u2019m sure things are different with COVID so as the person above said, probably best to ask your high school registrar to send a pdf of it to the hcc email. Nobody is supposed to be at the hcc campuses right now so I doubt they\u2019d expect you to give it in person.",

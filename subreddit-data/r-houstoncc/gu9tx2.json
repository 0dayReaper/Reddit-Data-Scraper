    "postText": "I transferred to HCC and start on June 8. I am doing the Associate\u2019s of Science in Engineering Science. I am taking 4 summer classes, all of which are online considering what\u2019s going on. Is it strange that only 1 class out of 4 has posted to the HCC bookstore the materials that are needed for the class? Calculus 1 is that class. Art appreciation, introduction to engineering, and engineering graphics have not. Classes start in a week and I have received no correspondence from any professors. Also, my eagle canvas online portal only shows my 4 courses as \u201cfuture courses\u201d. The reason I am posting this is because all of this could be completely normal. I am a new student and am just getting the feel of things. Is it normal? Or have the unusual circumstances of these times interfered with normal college operations?",

I already contact the advisor but didn't sort out the situation. The deadline to apply is November 13th. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7tpqsrca04s71.png?width=1706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a927469a15b1fb9362a279e459ed58b5e9c30dae",

They should be able to get the ball rolling for you.",

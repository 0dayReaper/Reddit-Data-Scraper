    "postText": "Hey everybody!\n\nI work with a small startup at MIT, focused on intercity mobility called Loop: [https://www.loop-ridesharing.com](https://www.loop-ridesharing.com/)\n\nWe\u2019re attempting to reimagine the future of post-CoVID transportation between American cities, creating safe spaces for students to rideshare between college campuses and home. We will be releasing beta tests in the coming weeks. If you have a student email address, own a driver's license, and are interested in sharing your ride for a bit of cash in return, sign up for our beta testing here:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gw-VVkt1nb7AX-ClIBS0y\\_v8FkVOFonlxf39\\_hZpC8A/viewform?edit\\_requested=true](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gw-VVkt1nb7AX-ClIBS0y_v8FkVOFonlxf39_hZpC8A/viewform?edit_requested=true)\n\nJon",

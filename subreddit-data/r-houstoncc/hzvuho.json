    "postText": "The only section of the class I can take recently became full. I\u2019ve been waiting forever on my advisor to give me credit for CHEM II by transferring my transcript so I can enroll in CHEM 2423. Unfortunately just today it became full, with 18 seats taken.\n\nWhat can I do in this case? It\u2019s an evening class and the only one I can take for CHEM 2423.\nI urgently need to take it this fall.\n\nHow likely would it open up?\nAlso, is there anyway or anything I could possibly do to enroll in that class? If I contact the professor or someone else, would I be able to enroll in that class.\n\nLike I seriously need to take this class this fall, and all other sections of this class conflict with my schedule.\n\nAny advice and input will be greatly appreciated!",

Those that live outside of the districts but are still in Texas, I think pay about $1800-$2000.  And those from outside Texas, or foreign have to pay $2000-$3000.  \n\nMy amounts maybe off a bit as I am now in Lubbock and have graduated HCCS, but this will give you an idea.  \n\nIf you have questions, don't be shy and ask the school or schools you want to attend.  They can often bend some residency requirements to make your attendance possible.  They in general care alot about their prospective and current students, and are super nice.\n\nGood luck!",

Some will send out syllabi before classes start, other will do it after the first week.  They might use zoom, teams, or Cisco web meaning.  There isn't a one size fits all category for HCC professors to follow even though tons of us students wish there was. Use professor ratings services like \"rate my professor\" and read the comments.  It's almost the only way to find out anything about them and how they hold class short of word of mouth.  Sorry I am not much help",

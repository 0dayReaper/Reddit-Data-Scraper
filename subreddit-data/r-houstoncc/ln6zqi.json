In my time at HCC, the loans typically disburse and then the Pell Grant disburses about a month later. So if the loan didn\u2019t cover the entire cost of tuition, then you\u2019ll have to wait for the Pell Grant to be disbursed. Once that is disbursed, $4 will be applied to your account and the rest will be refunded to you within the following 48 hours.",

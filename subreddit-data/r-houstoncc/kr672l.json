    "postText": "Our student-led team at M.I.T. is looking for students that may be interested in beta testing our mobile app this spring.\n\nLoop is a simple, social, safe ridesharing service for college students. At Loop, we are tackling the high costs of car ownership by democratizing auto access, providing an open platform for students to post and share rides. We keep costs low by prioritizing our users, giving them control over the ridesharing process from posting, to booking, to payment -- all in our mobile app.\n\nYou can learn more here: [https://www.loop-ridesharing.com](https://www.loop-ridesharing.com/) or feel free to drop me a DM directly or add your .edu email to the list: [Beta Testing Sign Up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gw-VVkt1nb7AX-ClIBS0y_v8FkVOFonlxf39_hZpC8A/viewform?edit_requested=true) if you may be interested.",

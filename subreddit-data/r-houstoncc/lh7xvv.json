I'm tired of \"studying\" in my room... my bed is so close and I end up napping :/\n\nHouston Public Libraries are closed, Fort Bend libraries are closed, HCC/UH/Rice libraries are closed. I don't like studying at coffee shops bc people are eating and not wearing masks. \n\nI like studying outside sometimes, but inside is where the outlets are at! \n\nI live in SW Houston, if anyone has anything in that area \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc48",

Best thing is to find a park that has a covered area and outlets. \nNot too familiar with SW but around HCC Central there are a lot of parks that have covered areas with outlets: midtown park, mcgovern park (in herman park), discovery green",

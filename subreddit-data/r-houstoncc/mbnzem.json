I believe in his class there are around 10-15 students at the moment and because of the pandemic, he studies at home (reads from the textbook and does some hw/quizzes online). On Saturdays, they meet up in person to review the material they've been studying at home, conduct tests, and do actual real-life scenario training. For the training, he's learned to quickly put on his suit, how to use the fire hose and hydrant, and other days where they were tested on what to do when there is smoke and you can't see anything also real fire training scenarios. From what he tells me it is a very physically intensive program. About the instructors, he has no issues with any of them and says they teach pretty well. I hope my comment was able to help you somewhat with your decision :)",

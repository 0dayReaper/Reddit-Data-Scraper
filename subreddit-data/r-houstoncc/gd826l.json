I\u2019m considering taking a nutrition class in the first 8 weeks session but I don\u2019t know if it will be harder since it would seemingly be more condensed in a short time frame and be difficult due to that. Also does it cost more or less? The same?",

If you know the professor that you are trying to take, I would highly suggest that you use [http://ratemyprofessors.com](http://ratemyprofessors.com/) which is like Yelp but for college professors.",

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just too early or if it\u2019s a matter of they haven\u2019t decided if the fall year will be online or not due to COVID. :/",

Schools are supposed to open up in Phase 3, we're in Phase 2 right now. The University of St. Thomas, TSU, U of H, and the biggies like Texas A&amp;M &amp; UT said that they will be doing face 2 face in the fall. That and depending on which class, some parts of the nutrition class are hands-on.",

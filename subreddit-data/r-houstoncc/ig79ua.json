    "postText": "I saw that online classes are on Canvas (?) It says that i must log in with hcc email, but i dont know the password. Was an account made for me when i applied or should i make one. But before I need that answered i have a multitude of other issues. I havent paid for classes yet. Is that something you do after you enroll or before? On the topic of enrolling, it seems i have to take a student success course or Educ 1300. It says to search that course up and enroll but when i have it in my shopping cart, and check the box, the enroll button is still greyed out and unclickable. The same is true for all the other classes in my shopping cart. This shit it so confusing... I really need help\n\nEdit- I forgot to mention that Im hoping to enroll in online anytime classes but i dont know how to differentiate them from regular classes. Is the only difference the room name? (HCC Online vs Campus)? I should also mention i havent paid any fees yet.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m gonna make an assumption and attempt to help here based off what I remember when I first applied in high school. For the password, you have to make your own. So when you first evert try to log in and you obviously don\u2019t know your password, you choose whatever it says at the bottom like forgot password or something like that and go through those steps to create it.\n\nAs for the classes, did you file for FAFSA? He\u2019s you gotten it in yet if so? If you have aid, how it works is you\u2019ll see a balance once enrolled in your classes and after a couple weeks of school have gone by, the FAFSA will go through and your tuition will be paid (if you have enough or more FAFSA) if not then you\u2019d set up a payment plan if you don\u2019t have FAFSA or don\u2019t have enough to cover the full tuition. \n\nAs for the greyed out and unclickable thing for all the classes, only thing I can think of is speak to an advisor if you have one assigned to you or find the email of one, they can usually tell you what\u2019s going on. Also double check to see if you have anything in your to-do because I know theres some things you MUST do/turn in before being allowed to enroll. \n\nFor online anytime, you can choose it as an option when searching for classes. I forgot what the scrollable slot says but it\u2019s there as an option. And they will also say \u201cTBA or To be announced\u201d for the days/time. \n\nBest of luck!\n\nEdit- For choosing online anytime, it\u2019ll be under \u201cMode of Instruction\u201d you\u2019ll see the options for flex campus, online on a schedule, online anytime and lab based.",

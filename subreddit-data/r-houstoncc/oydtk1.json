    "postText": "I am a new student to HCC and I'm curious as to what it'll be like, especially if I take in person classes. What are the teachers and students like? From my own looking into it it doesn't seem too wild or anything but I still want to hear from current students. I am also 24 so I'm curious if there are many older students as well. Also does anyone know the process for work study?",

            "comment": "Work Study I believe has to be filled out when applying for your FAFSA. Can't remember, though. When you're filling your FAFSA form out, it will ask you if you'd be interested in receiving work-study as a form of financial aid -- I don't know if this in ADDITION to the financial aid you receive or this is a substitute for it. Best to check with the financial aid office.  \n\n\nThe professors are hit &amp; miss. I've had some that were great. On the other hand, I had a few that....well....weren't. Really the only trouble I've ever really had w/ a professor is not being able to understand some of them (ESL).   \nI'll say this: HCC (from my experience) definitely opens you up to a whole different world. It shows you that Houston is probably not what you've always thought it to be. I never would've known that there are so many Armenian, Russian/east European, &amp; so many Asian immigrants here (not Vietnamese, Chinese, Korean or Japanese). Houston's recently been labeled as America's most diverse city, &amp; for good reason.  \n\n\nAs far the older student thing....I've seen folks fresh out of high school &amp; I've seen folks in their 40s+. I've only attended 4 diff campuses &amp; they all had their own age thing going on. Pinemont (now closed) &amp; Katy seemed to have more older, Central was more folks in their early to mid-20s, some late-20s here &amp; there, &amp; Northline was either much-older folks or kids straight out of high school (&amp; in many cases, still IN high school). Just my observation. Could be wrong.  \n\n\nIdk about in-person classes. I've taken them my whole life, but given the current environment there may/may not even be many in-person classes this semester.",

Then again, the bookstore does let you return books past the first day of class... just a pain having to stay in line though.\nTo be honest, it is really expensive buying from the campus bookstore (ran by Barnes &amp; Nobles) - Amazon Marketplace is the way to go, once you know which books you need.",

    "postText": "Hello, I was recently accepted to CI as a transfer student from VC, I was curious to know the cost of attendance? I am a Cali resident and local to the area, like short drive-local and I was trying to crunch some numbers before accepted or deferring my letter from CI. Would anyone care to share the cost per semester? Ty, I would be SOC transfer- junior for Spring 2021.",

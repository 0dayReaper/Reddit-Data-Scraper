    "postText": "I was surprised there wasn't a car club at CSU CI due to the location and the fact one of the entries to school is a great canyon road so I am in the process of setting one up. We are currently seeking an advisor, but have officers and a submitted constitution. We are currently Channel Islands Automotive Enthusiasts but we welcome anything with a motor in it, and students without cars. I am planning on weekly catch-up meets and also discussing showing races in auditoriums and going to local events like the Cruise-Ins at the Petersen Museum.",

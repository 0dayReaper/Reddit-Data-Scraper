    "postText": "EDIT: I\u2019ve been accepted!!! \n\nHi guys. I applied to 5 universities &amp; I\u2019ve heard back from all of them except for CSUCI \nEverywhere online says acceptance should be sent at the end of January, &amp; I still haven\u2019t heard anything.. \nI\u2019m starting to get anxious because this is the university I really want to go to. \nAll other universities are already sending housing emails &amp; emails about enrolling\u2026 \n\nI sent my application in November\u2026 it\u2019s not like I used the extension application date they added. \nAny advice?? Is this normal?",

FL isn't required and the Science is more than covered by other transferable classes.  I'm calling tomorrow but have already begun preparing my appeal since my AP scores are from over 4 years ago and will take longer to arrive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate: As of 8:54pm my status in myCI says \"Admitted.\"\n\nI accepted and it now says \"Incomplete\" and that I owe $50 like u/Instance-Fearless says.",

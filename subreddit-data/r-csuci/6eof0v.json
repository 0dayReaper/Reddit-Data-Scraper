    "postText": "I'm a transfer CS major, and I'm a little worried about being prepared for classes. Basically, I've taken the intro courses at the local community colleges, but I haven't really learned much from them. Most of the learning I have is from my own free time and programming work experience, but I'm not sure if that equates to me being ready for upper division.\n\nI talked to the CI department for academic counseling, a lot of my lower division/intro courses don't transfer to CSUCI. But based on my grades, work experience, and some other higher level CS classes I took at other colleges that do transfer, they suggested that I jump right into the next course(s) in the roadmap. They suggested I petition for a course substitution for all the lower division classes, which apparently have been done before by other students coming from the same local CC.\n\nI think that would leave me starting somewhere around be COMP 151 (Data Structures and Program Design). Then after would be: COMP 232 (Programming Languages), and COMP 262 (Computer Organization and Architecture).\n\nI'm trying to decide if I have the knowledge to start there, or if I should just start with the intro classes (which I would be fine with if I don't have the foundation).  And some general questions: What main programming languages are taught at CI (so I can get a headstart over summer)? Is there anything I should be proficient in before taking COMP 151?",

The idea is to gauge where transfer students are at and give a refresher to other students. If you get it and have no idea what's going on, you'll still have time to register for 150 as you can enroll in courses a few weeks after the semester starts (if there's room). Also keep in mind the CS department has free walk-in tutoring available.\n\nIt's been a while so I don't recall exactly, but if you understand how to use interfaces and linked lists you'll probably be okay jumping into 151.\n\n232 is taught in C, I would recommend learning a bit of it in your own time before taking the class, as the first few weeks are just a crash course in C so you'll save yourself some stress. If you understand allocating memory, pointers, and strings, you'll be fine. Also I found having an Apple laptop made 232 and 362 easier as the courses are taught on Macs and so you won't need to do any VM stuff.\n\n232 and 362 are the main \"weed out\" courses. \n\nI just graduated Cum Laude with a Bachelors in CS as a transfer student and was an officer of a couple clubs so if you have any questions about classes or student life please don't hesitate to ask.\n\n",

You feel that those classes didn't really prepare you much in terms of programming? I was thinking about taking some classes on the side, but also thinking about just using Codeacademy and Udemy... What do you think? P.s. I hope you things work out for you and I would consult with other students in the CS program who have actually gone through the process, instead of relying on counselors who probably aren't as familiar. I know when I was doing my undergrad my academic counselor didn't know shit about my major and how hard the actual classes were... so just a heads up. ",

The lower division classes didn't transfer because CSUCI saw a trend of CS transfers coming from Ventura who only knew how to print lines.\n\nAlso, Moorpark College's CS classes do transfer to CI.\n\nThe classes didn't prepare me as much as the time I spent learning on my own and from internships. So it's not like I don't have any programming background coming in. I'm here on reddit hoping to find other CS majors who can tell me some information about the classes (what language was used, core topics, etc), so I can compare them to what I know and make a decision.\n\nI'm aware academic counselors aren't very bright about actual classes in the major, and that CS in general is a tough major.",

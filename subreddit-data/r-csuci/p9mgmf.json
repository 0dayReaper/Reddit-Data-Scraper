I only have a 15 minute gap period so it wouldn\u2019t be enough time to get home. Btw I\u2019m an incoming freshman",

I don\u2019t know how the environment will be on campus this semester but maybe the cafeteria could be a good option.\n\nI know last semester they improved the WiFi to cover the parking and had some outdoor study tables. I don\u2019t know if those study tables are still going to be there but You might still get WiFi in the parking lot so your car could be a good option free of other noise if you need to interact on your zoom calls.\n\nThere used to be a lot of quiet little spots around to study on campus. So unless a lot has changed you shouldn\u2019t have problems finding a place to zoom.",

I\u2019m just not sure if those are study halls so not sure if you need to be dead silent. I think student union would also be a good place! I\u2019m going to try that tomorrow",

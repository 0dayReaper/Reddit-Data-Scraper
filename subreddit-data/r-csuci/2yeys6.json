I'm planning to move up there after my semester is over and I didn't know about off campus living. I'm planning on moving up here with my boyfriend so on campus is out of the question. Also what do most students do for jobs? Any advice would be amazing ! \ud83d\ude0a",

There are a lot of apartment options in the area so I'm sure you will be able to find something in your price range. As for jobs, there are tons of shopping areas in Camarillo and the surrounding towns, so if you don't mind working retail you are sure to find something. There are also on campus jobs that pay pretty well and are easy to work around your school schedule. ",

    "postText": "So I got accepted into CSUCI last Friday ( I was denied when accepting letters were sent out first out but was later accepted). I got a lot of questions and I hope I could get some of them answered. How much is tuition and is it paid by semester or year? I applied for financial aid (dream act) and I qualify. I don\u2019t know what exactly it will pay or how it will happen. I\u2019m first generation so I\u2019m completely lost. I know housing is expensive, as well for off campus, and how it\u2019s really difficult for people to find affordable places to live in Camarillo, Ventura, Oxnard, Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Somis, Simi Valley, but about how much is it living off campus. How is CSUCI? The times I\u2019ve been there for tours and field trips it looks depressing and boring. I\u2019m interested into majoring in Liberal studies for teaching and learning. What should I look forward to or avoid ? I hope to get some questions answered. Thank you.",

            "comment": "Tuition alone w/o any financial aid is around $3k+ a semester iirc, paid every semester. Regarding financial aid, might be different depending on the aid but I had to pay full price up front then the aid reimbursement would come a bit later.\n\nHousing is getting pretty costly even off campus, even $1k a month might get you the cheapest apartment or a decent room in someone else's place.\n\nI personally liked the campus. Nice looking, not crazy. I wouldn't agree at all that it's depressing, but maybe boring. It's out in the middle of the fields/mountains and there's not too much to do on campus, but it's not too far a drive from the more interesting places in surrounding cities.\n\nOne major note is that it's largely a commuter school and a lot of the students live off campus, so it doesn't have as much of a \"community\" vibe as some of the bigger UC's and stuff.",

            "comment": "First and foremost, congratulations on your acceptance! Going to try my best to answer your questions below. I can't speak to the Liberal Studies program though (I was a bio major myself).\n\n**Tuition:**  \nTuition is paid every semester. I do not have personal experience with Dream Act financial aid specifically, but I do know that those on Cal Grants and federal student loans have financial aid automatically applied to their tuition balance before each semester begins. I think the same type of process happens with Dream Act financial aid, but it would be safe to direct these questions directly to Financial Aid (give them a call or send them an email, they're all really nice people and would be happy to get this answered for you). Here's their contact information: [https://www.csuci.edu/financialaid/contact-us.htm](https://www.csuci.edu/financialaid/contact-us.htm)\n\n**Living expenses:**  \nUnfortunately, most of SoCal is a hot mess when it comes to housing affordability... Ventura county is no exception to this. If you plan to live off-campus, living with other students will definitely cut down on the cost of rent and utilities. Prices will vary wildly depending on how many roommates you have, exact location, how old the building is, etc. Here are a few resources that could help you to find a place that works best for you (most have prices so you can get a good idea of average cost right now too):\n\n* Semi-official CSUCI off-campus housing website: [https://csuci.och101.com/](https://csuci.och101.com/)\n* Facebook groups that have listings:\n   * [https://www.facebook.com/groups/VenturaCoRentals/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/VenturaCoRentals/)\n   * [https://www.facebook.com/groups/2336153079735410/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2336153079735410/)\n   * [https://www.facebook.com/groups/944459559356983/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/944459559356983/)\n   * [https://www.facebook.com/groups/1723785191191847/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1723785191191847/)\n   * [https://www.facebook.com/groups/207786993172738/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/207786993172738/)\n* Craigslist sites:\n   * Rooms for rent/shared housing: [https://ventura.craigslist.org/search/roo](https://ventura.craigslist.org/search/roo)\n   * Apartments for rent: [https://ventura.craigslist.org/search/apa](https://ventura.craigslist.org/search/apa)\n\n***Be VERY careful with Facebook and Craigslist listings though*** \\- if it sounds too good to be true, it might be (there are TONS of scams on there, Craigslist has more scams than Facebook though). Also consider bringing a friend with you if you choose to check out any listings in person.\n\n**Campus:**  \nIt's been a while since I went to CI, but activity there definitely ebbed and flowed. Depending on the day, there could be a lot of interesting things to do. I definitely recommend joining a few clubs that sound interesting as early on as you can too.\n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "I lived off campus, I rented a room from a family that was near the train tracks. It\u2019s definitely a school where you won\u2019t get too distracted but easier to participate in student government and other clubs. Also easier to meet with professors and other administrators in school. I also lived in Oxnard where I found housing to be a little more comfortable but still on a student budget it was really pushing it. It was a culture shock for me since I lived in a big city so be aware to make those adjustments. I ended up transferring to Long Beach and has much as I enjoyed it I really missed CI.",

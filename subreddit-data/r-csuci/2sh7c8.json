            "comment": "I first joined CI because it was close to my place and was a 4 year CSU (cheaper than UC, less commute, etc). I have found small class sizes, passionate professors, and a quality education at CI. All for a good price.\n\n-------\n\nThe campus is beautiful and peaceful. I live off campus and do not party so I cannot speak to that scene. From those I've know in dorms, it can be a chill place if you put yourself out there to meet people and do things but events are not as frequent as they are at big UC's.\n\nI am about to graduate and have found CI instructors to be generally passionate and interested in your education. Professors like when you come by office hours and participate in class. Class sizes are REALLY small, especially in upper div STEM courses. My major is CS/Math and it is not uncommon to have 2-5 or 10-15 student classes with a passionate/fun professor. \n\nThere are few research opportunities on campus so you would need to search for them or ask to start some on your own, if that is your thing. You need research on your CV for grad school, if you want to go that path.\n\nIf you have questions about majors (STEM specifically), drop by the STEM Center in El Dorado Hall. Students there can give you the truth about professors, courses, and majors. Good Luck!",

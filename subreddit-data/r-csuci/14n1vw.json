    "postText": "hey r/csuci\n\nTo make this brief, I need a tutor for my Calc BC class, as the title would suggest. The things I'm having trouble with are things like\n\n derive y=arcsin(root(1-4x^2 ))\n\n Integrate (x+2)/(root(4-x^2 )) dx\n\nUse logarithmic differentiation to find dy/dx for y=((x^2 -3)^(3/2)cuberoot(2x+5))/(x^2 -1 )\n\nI live in the Camarillo area. Please comment on available times, how much you'd want, and anything else.\n\nSorry, it's my first time requesting a tutor, so i don't really know how to inform you guys. Thank you for reading.",

CI has an *amazing* tutoring staff that is dedicated to providing the best and most comprehensive assistance for students. They are located in the [Learning Resource Center](http://www.csuci.edu/learningresourcecenter/) on the second floor of Broome Library.\n\nWhile this service is for students, if you sent them an email (lrc@csuci.edu), they may be able to put you in contact with a student tutor offering private services.\n\n\nBest of luck!",

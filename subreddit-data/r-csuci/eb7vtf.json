Graduation is next year in spring, do I need to be enrolled in spring to be eligible to walk during ceremony or do I just wait for the ceremony and I don\u2019t need to be enrolled next semester?",

It\u2019s been a couple years now and I remember I finished in the fall and I applied for graduation so everything was made official. I ended up not going to the ceremony. \n\nThings may have changed since then. I believe that was 2016.\n\nUltimately, I\u2019d check with the office there for what the best practice would be. I\u2019m sure they are familiar with this scenario.\n\nEdit: congrats!!!!!",

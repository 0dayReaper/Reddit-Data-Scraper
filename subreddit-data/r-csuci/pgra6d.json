    "postText": "So I was exploring the abandoned part of the building with my roommate a few days ago, and stumbled upon a full art studio inside the left side of the building. It was the only place in the whole building with working electricity(other than the basement stairs, creepily enough), and seemed a lot more recent than the other parts of the building. Plus \\*a lot\\* of stuff of very high value\n\nAnyone have any idea what it even is???",

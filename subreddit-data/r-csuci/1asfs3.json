I have already checked out the campus and i really liked the atmosphere!  Beautiful campus and i love how secluded it is.  \n\nI was wondering if you guys could tell me what you like and dislike about the school.  I will be living off campus so i don't need info on housing.  How are the clubs?  What is parking like?  How difficult is it to get classes (ill be coming in as a Junior).  Also how is the psychology department if you have had any experience with it?\n\nThanks a lot guys maybe ill see ya around campus next year! :]",

            "comment": "Psych department is very large and very good. I've never heard any complaints about the professors in the psych program either. Parking is meh; much more expensive than Moorpark for a semester pass. The clubs here are good too; I believe there's a psych club as well as Psi Chi (psychology national honor society).\n\n\n\nThe thing that's going to suck, though, is registering for classes. As a transfer student, you're going to be the last to register before the semester begins. Yep, even after the freshmen with no college credit. But after that, you'll register according to your unit count.\n\n\nSee you around!",

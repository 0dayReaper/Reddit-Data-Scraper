Make sure to join volunteering clubs and clubs that fit your interest so that you may meet people from different majors and not just your own. Also, I would take advantage of all the hiking trails down here. Keep in mind that the school is mostly a commuter school, so not much activity will be going on at campus on the weekends, so go out and explore other cities as well. Visit L.A., Ventura, Santa Barbara, Thousand Oaks, etc . . . if you are able to. Also, people sometimes get together and catch a Dodgers game once in a while- it's a chill time even if you don't like baseball.",

And yes, I have always wanted to learn how to surf ahaha. Thanks for the advice, it's always good to know the things I can do in the area :)",

The school app will be really useful, so you may want to have that on your phone as well. The study abroad programs are pretty nice here too- if you\u2019re interested.

I just graduated so I can\u2019t help out that way, but maybe finding people on other platforms could help too?\nI would definitely recommend following some Instagram accounts like csuci, ci_studentgovt, etc. so you can get an idea of what happens at CI. Just in the search bar put in csuci and other accounts will pop up. \nI\u2019d 100% recommend going onto your myci account and find the CiSync link and follow whatever clubs/organizations you think you\u2019d be interested.",

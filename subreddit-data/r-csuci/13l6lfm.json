And there are also locations on campus that provide free condoms if you need. Student health services is one of the locations and another good one is WPE in Arroyo Hall.",

Visit is free but if you end up needing a prescription, ask for the generic or low cost) Planned parenthood does have its own family planning insurance also! Everything I had at both locations was covered completely free.",

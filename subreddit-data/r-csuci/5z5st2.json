    "postText": "Hi there, I will be transferring in Fall 2017 (I took some time, based on my options and personal situation. to select CSUCI so no need to dissuade me :))\n\nHow is the housing for transfer students?  I definitely want to live on campus.  I should also ask the same for freshman since my sister my also attend.\n\nI'm a serious gamer and would be bringing decent gaming rig.  How is in the onsite internet?  Is there any kind of gaming community?\n\nThanks",

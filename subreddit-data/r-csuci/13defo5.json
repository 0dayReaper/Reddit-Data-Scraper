It leverages a lot of the same skills - troubleshooting, cybersecurity, technical writing and documentation, Linux skills, breaking shit - but it is much more relaxed as I don't have to work directly with clients.  Doesn't hurt that it pays me 1.5x what the MSP did either.",

This was back in 2021 so the job market was still in a weird place (all remote interviews, etc.) but I wound up getting in with an MSP pretty quickly.  Full benefits and a pretty decent salary.\n\nProfessors at CI were by and large excellent - there was nobody that I could not stand, though some professors could be a bit dry in their presentation.  [Kevin Scrivnor](http://scrivnor.cikeys.com/), who teaches UNIX 1/2 and Computer Networking, was one of the best damn professors I've ever had the pleasure of learning from.  Extremely engaging, presents the material in a really clear way, and those courses continue to be the most relevant in my line of work.",

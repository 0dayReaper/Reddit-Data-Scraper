    "postText": "I went to SDSU for a couple years, then started experiencing some pretty severe mental health problems so I came home and have been taking some online classes at (Moorpark) Community College for 2 more years now, and there\u2019s a chance I will transfer to CSUCI next Fall, with an AA-T in Econ. The main reason for CSUCI is because it is pretty close to my house so I could still live at home if need be, which is pretty much the most important factor for me. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve always had pretty bad social anxiety, and small classes sizes make me really anxious. I know most people prefer them and they generally are better for students, but I feel uneasy about the increased attention on each student, especially after at SDSU most of my classes had triple digit number of students, which I preferred. I realize this isn\u2019t really something I\u2019ll be able to do anything about, especially as a transfer student where class sizes will continue to shrink, but I\u2019m wondering if anyone else had this fear and was able to get over it, or at least manage it better? The last thing I want is to feel super anxious about going to all of my classes every day, which is what I\u2019m worried about. (I do have a therapist who I\u2019ll discuss this with too but was hoping to also hear from some students)",

You never know if you're going to be asked to present or attend something requiring you look nice. \n\nWhat might be an absolute must is preparing a \"go bag\" in case something happens. Fires here sometimes force us to evacuate. Just a normal go bag with the addition of masks for the wildfire air quality. Leave it under your bed and forget about it until you need it. \n\nA good flashlight is always helpful as well as a cushion you can strap to the dormitory chairs, wooden chairs hurt after a while. If you come from a big city and need background noise on our very quiet campus, buy a small air purifier.",

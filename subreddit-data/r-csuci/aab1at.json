    "postText": "I will be transferring from my Community College an start attending a CSU in Fall 2019. CSUCI has become a top choice and I just got my acceptance yesterday. Wondering where the best options are for off-campus housing (probably looking for a one bedroom or studio apartment). I would assume a lot of students live in Camarillo but I\u2019m pretty much wondering if any of you guys live in Newbury Park or Thousand Oaks area, or if the price difference between there and Camarillo is really huge. Thank you in advance!",

I would love a studio, but a decent studio in Oxnard for cheap is like 1200?  The other places are 1600+.  Then, there's internet, utilities, etc. which will bring up costs by 100. By renting a room, I have TV, internet, live in a nice neighborhood, all utilities are paid for, private entrance, the owners are sweet, and it's all for 800.  Some might say that even 800 is expensive (there are people renting rooms for 600), but you know what, I'm comfy, and I'm still saving quite a bit of money.\n\nI take the Potrero Rd. mountain pass to and from school.  I don't mind it.",

            "comment": "There are two \"Gym's.\" One is the Rec Center that is pretty well equipped. Lots of machines, basketball court inside, weights, etc. They also host a lot of pick up games most evenings. The other gym is smaller and located within Santa Cruz and is solely for on campus housing students. This gym is mostly just machines, and a smaller area for stretching/weights. I don't believe they have any weights there, but you can definitely bring your own if theyre compact. \n\nOverall, the Reccenter is an excellent alternative to paying for a gym membership. It can get busy around 3-6pm since this is when most students are done with classes, but the rest of the day is pretty mellow. \n\nIf you want to workout at the Rec, make sure you have your ID card as you'll need to log in each time. Before you can start going though, you'll also need to fill out a release form with the standard liability release. You can find more info on this at the Rec. I think it can be filled out online. To get into the Santa Cruz gym, you'll need a housing keycard to get into the building that its located in. \n\nAny other specific questions?",

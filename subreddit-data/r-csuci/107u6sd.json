    "postText": "Hi everyone, so Spring semester is almost here and many people are graduating. I wanted to get a take on how you would feel about banning confetti on campus.\nIf you do not know already it can be \n-harsh on the environment since it is plastic\n-makes the landscape workers jobs harder to clean up\nBut luckly there are many alternatives\n\nWhat do yall think?",

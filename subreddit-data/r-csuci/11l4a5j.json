Although I can say that the campus does fall under the more calm and relaxed environment. For me, this is great because I can focus on my courses and get prepared for grad school. There are definitely things to do if you own a car. Amusement parks, LA, Ventura, and Santa Barbara are within 1 hr away. This school is also very affordable compared to other UC's or even CSU's, and the campus is beautiful. Also, our student to professor ratio is about 25:1. I think this campus is great, but if you're looking for a more lively experience, then look into other campuses.",

Im looking for a more relaxed campus since I\u2019m older. From everything I\u2019ve seen i feel like it will be the right choice for me.",

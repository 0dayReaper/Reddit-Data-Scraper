    "postText": "Hi, I'm  going to be visiting my parents soon in camarillo to attend a memorial service for a recently passed family member. I don't want to bring any diseases into my parents house since one of my family members is immunocompromised, so I was hoping to camp.\n\nWith that said, I'm looking for a place close to camarillo to camp for a few nights. It seems like so many places are still closed or are far from town. Any ideas on places that you can camp for either free or less than 20 a night near camarillo? \n\nThank you",

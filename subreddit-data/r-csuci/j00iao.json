Though most other class sizes are also small unless it\u2019s a staple GE for all majors. And yea a bit, I\u2019ve been in the same classes with the same people semester after semester so it\u2019s like kinda homey and stuff if that makes sense?Different classes but same students. We have each other numbers and stuff and help each other out with papers and homework. I love the history department.",

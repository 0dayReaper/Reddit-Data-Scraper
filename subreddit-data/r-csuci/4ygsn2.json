    "postText": "The choir at CI is unique in that it is made up of both students and residents of Ventura County, ranging in age from middle school to elderly. The skill set of the individuals in the group is wide. There are beginners as well as professionals in the choir! The music is mostly classical, but there is something for everyone, and being a good singer isn't necessarily a prerequisite.\n\nThe entry procedure is simple. Register for [PAMU 307](https://ciapps.csuci.edu/ScheduleOfClasses/SOC/CourseInformation/Fall-2016/PAMU/307/None/University-Chorus) and show up the first day of class (7:00pm-9:30pm.) Dr. Kuan-Fen Liu will asses your voice in private by having you sing scales (ascending and descending,) testing your tonal memory, and asking about your musical experience. After that, you will give your contact information to the appropriate people, receive your music, and will sing and practice as a member of the choir!\n\nTry it out, and bring your friends!",

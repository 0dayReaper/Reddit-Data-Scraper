The 100 and 200 classes are kinda crammed but the upper divisions weeded out the people doing their GE\u2019s. \n\nIf you transferred or choose to go there you should ask the professors about what projects they\u2019re working on. When it comes time for Capstone they may choose to let you help with their research, which can be pretty cool. \n\nIf you don\u2019t mind not having a school social life then this college is a good choice.

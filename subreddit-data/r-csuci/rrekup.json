I know a few people who attended a fully in person class online through zoom. They just talked to the prof about zooming the class. \n\nFrom the emails we've been getting, the admins are gonna push for in person classes. However they say that the situation is \"fluid\" so we never know if it will be like February 2020 all over again.",

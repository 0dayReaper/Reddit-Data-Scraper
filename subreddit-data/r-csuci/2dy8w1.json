    "postText": "I just found out about this; it appears Daniel Lee passed away just a few days ago after a hell of a battle with cancer.\n\nWhile I am not a sociology major and only took one class with him, SOC 100 was the very first class I ever took at CSUCI back in Fall 2010. It was definitely a challenge but I could tell that Daniel was incredibly passionate with his field, not to mention that he was a hell of a nice guy. It was great to run into him around campus (and Camarillo in general) and just talk about whatever. He will definitely be missed.\n\nFor those who may not be aware, there will be a memorial service held on Sunday, August 24 between 2 and 4 PM at the Broome Library. **You do need to RSVP for this event.

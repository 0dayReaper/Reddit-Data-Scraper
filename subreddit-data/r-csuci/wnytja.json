            "comment": "The school has a policy which they randomly selective students to sign a document saying that the student must only use financial aid for educational purposes. According to the financial aid office they currently have a high volume of documents to process, many of which won\u2019t be completed by the deadline. I highly suggest you check your email and contact the financial aid office. I spoke to them earlier this week and their response was to take a loan out or pay out of pocket. Seems very pathetic and unprofessional response especially since FAFSA approved the funds. I wish I knew who\u2019s genius idea this was.",

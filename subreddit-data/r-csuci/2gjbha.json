    "postText": "Am I the only one noticing a bunch of ants everywhere on this campus? Del Norte has a bunch of ants. The library has a bunch of ants. Random meeting rooms have a bunch of ants. I am constantly flicking them off of me. I wouldn't know about housing... but I'll assume ants. I was walking out of a parking lot the other day and saw loads of ants everywhere. \n\nHere is an ongoing list of my personal theories... \n\n* 1) The new construction has upset a massive ant lair and the ants have spread into the surrounding campus to locate a new lair.\n* 2) The ants are contracted by ISIS to infiltrate the intelligentsia of the United States to gain vital information (suggested by a \"friend\").\n\n\nAm I crazy? Am I the source of the ants? Are ants just attracted to me? Why is this happening? \n\n",

It was a market simulation where you\u2019re assigned to a team of students and you compete against other teams of students. It was a lot of work,  but not quite as dry as writing a capstone essay. \n\nNo, you\u2019re not expected to remember everything from every class. You\u2019re expected to be familiar with the business principals that you\u2019ve already demonstrated familiarity with by passing those courses, and then apply those principals to help make business decisions in the sim (assuming they do the same capstone project).\n\nBest of luck! Don\u2019t get discouraged, you\u2019re almost done!",

Then I did a 10 page literature review. And read a book and did a report on that. But idk that was health science I\u2019m sure business would be different",

It's an easy A if you put in minimal effort. But business might be different. I'm sure you can find classmates who have taken it",

I took the business capstone like the other user said it\u2019s mostly a business simulation game which was more annoying than difficult. I didn\u2019t try exceptionally hard and made it out with a high B.",

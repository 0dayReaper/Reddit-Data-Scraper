I had to appeal to CSUCI so I got accepted a little late and didn't think to apply for housing beforehand, so now I'm just aggressively staring down the wait list everyday hoping my number goes up. I'm also just trying to find people off campus to live with, does anyone know of a roommate wanted board on facebook just for CI students?",

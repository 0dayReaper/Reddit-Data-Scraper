    "postText": "Is there a way to make DUO ask less often because having to pull out my phone to go through the 2FA every day and sometimes multiple times a day is soo annoying. Literally makes me wish this place was still an insane asylum so I just could get institutionalized for how having to do this all the time makes me wanna go crazy lol. And every university implements this at all levels even though it's universally despised for some god-awful reason, because we really need TFA to get a zoom link or turn in an assignment.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/xfl9rr/duo\\_authentication\\_is\\_annoying/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/xfl9rr/duo_authentication_is_annoying/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/j9azy9/duo\\_push\\_is\\_the\\_worst/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/j9azy9/duo_push_is_the_worst/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/hs216w/i\\_hate\\_duo\\_push/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/hs216w/i_hate_duo_push/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/yorku/comments/mg06mr/i\\_am\\_so\\_fing\\_annoyed\\_with\\_duo\\_push/](https://www.reddit.com/r/yorku/comments/mg06mr/i_am_so_fing_annoyed_with_duo_push/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/UMBC/comments/10vg4ab/duo\\_push/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UMBC/comments/10vg4ab/duo_push/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/xqwctx/duo\\_push\\_sucks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/xqwctx/duo_push_sucks/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/rzaadl/duo\\_twofactor\\_authentication/](https://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/rzaadl/duo_twofactor_authentication/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/uda5w9/abolish\\_duo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/uda5w9/abolish_duo/)",

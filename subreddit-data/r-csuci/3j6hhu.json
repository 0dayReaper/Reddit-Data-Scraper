    "postText": "Hi CSUCI, \n\n\nIf you're looking for a new sport to try, I would like to invite you to come play badminton! This was a group started by a local and some friends that I am helping get the word out. We welcome all levels and people 18+ (you will have to sign some release forms).\nWe are looking for at least 14 regulars to join in on the fun. The cost of the gym is $84 a night. A donation of $6 to $10 will help cover the cost of this gym over time. It's reasonable for the space, given that the school sets up and takes down the equipment nightly. At the moment, it is being orchestrated as a nonprofit association club, open to the public.\nWhen: Every Tuesday from 7pm-9pm. We just started 2 weeks ago!\nWhere: Ventura Balboa Middle School Gym\n247 S Hill Rd Ventura, CA 93003 The gym is located at Woodland drive off of Victoria.\nPlease wear indoor court shoes/sneakers and bring a racket. Birdies/shuttlecocks will be provided.\nPlease message me if you are interested or would like to know more.\nHope to see you there!",

We are still looking for members to join. \n\nPlease visit our facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ventura-Badminton/1711851205701338?sk=info&amp;tab=page_info.\nTo stabilize the inflow of player donations for payment of gym fees to the school, we're looking for sustainable methods. First we are going to explore donations from health organizations in Ventura that promote \"healthy adult exercise\".  We have access to a 501c tax identification number which will enable us to receive tax deductible donations for our club.  This could substantially reduce our operating costs.  \n\nSecond we are looking into membership for a season.  Obviously out of town players donate the regular guest amount, and those who are members we will offer some advantages.\n\n\n",

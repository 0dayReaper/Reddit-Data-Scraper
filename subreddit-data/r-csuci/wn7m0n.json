    "postText": "Hey y'all, I was just wondering if the wifi connection is dependable enough to play on. I've heard nothing but great news about the wifi speeds at CSUCI, but I'm worried if I'll get packet loss or some sort of lag when I play online multiplayer games. If the wifi isn't stable, how long should my ethernet cable be?",

Granted I'm not a PVP guy and this is before they implemented BattlEye to combat lag switching and the like, but I think it's acceptable for casual play.  Download speed was pretty excellent from what I remember.\n\nSo long as your Ethernet cable is CAT 5e or CAT 6 and &lt;300ft, you'll see no performance difference based on cable length.  Go with whatever fits physically in your space.  25ft would give you plenty of excess to put your rig anywhere in the room.\n\nI think the wifi is fine for gaming, but it's basically never gonna beat Ethernet for stability and speed.\n\nEDIT: Apparently I don't know my anti-cheat software.",

I was stuck with using a wireless connection the entire time I lived in Santa Cruz. The wifi is definitely stable enough to game and stream whatever you like. Although I will say that at times the connection would be iffy, but for the most part I did just fine with a wireless connection. Might have to ask your RA about it if you really want to connect and ethernet cable",

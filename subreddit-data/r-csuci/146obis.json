    "postText": "Had been considering bringing a small child size bed tent with me for years since I am afraid of the dark, and my roommates likely will not be ok sleeping with the light on. Sleeping in dark spaces is easier for me in an enclosed space. At home it was my bed canopy, but of course I can not take that with me due to needing hooks for the ceiling. I figured since bed tents you just kind of plop on the bed it would be a more likely bet, but does anyone know for sure with this school? If not, is there a particular reason why? Some websites suggest bed tents for privacy purpose.",

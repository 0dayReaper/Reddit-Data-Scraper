            "comment": "It's likely a complicated situation. If I had to wager a somewhat educated guess here (as someone who graduated a while ago but was deeply involved in leadership at all levels of the university), it would be this:\n\nEnrollment is falling across the entire CSU system (and many other colleges across the country), a trend that started during the pandemic. Causes are likely multifaceted, but in general: less FTEs (full time equivalent students) = less tuition fee revenue &amp; less state general fund allocations = less money for faculty/staff salaries = difficult choices have to be made.\n\nThat said, with falling enrollment in some programs, there may be analyses showing that there is unmet regional demand for other programs that aren't active yet (and thus they get developed &amp; launched). Many of these programs take years to develop and hire staff for, so it's possible that this is what happened.",

            "comment": "A fellow student in one of my classes who is very involved in student government was explaining that the university's priorities have been focused more on bringing new students in, rather than retaining the students it currently has. CI has been going all-out on recruiting events and advertising, something I did notice in the last few months. This may be due to falling enrollment numbers. Either way, I'd think the university might have better success if they focused on keeping students in.",

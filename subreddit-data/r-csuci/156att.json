There are a lot of great opportunities in each of its four entities - Student Government *(great experience for political science majors)*, Student Programming Board, CI View Newspaper, and The Nautical Yearbook.\n\nIf you want more information and/or want to know how to get involved with any of them, here's how you can do it:\n\n\n**Student Government:**\n\nEmail - SGASI@csuci.edu\n\nWebsite - http://studentgov.csuci.edu/\n\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/CSUCIStudentGovernment\n\n\n**Student Programming Board (SPB):**\n\nEmail - ASI.SPB@csuci.edu\n\nWebsite - http://spb.csuci.edu\n\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/StudentProgrammingBoard\n\n\n**CI View Newspaper:**\n\nEmail - CIView.Editor@csuci.edu\n\nWebsite - http://www.civiewnews.com/\n\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/CIView\n\n**The Nautical Yearbook:**\n\nEmail - nautical@csuci.edu\n\nWebsite: http://yearbook.csuci.edu/\n\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Nautical-Yearbook/\n\n*Also, for more information about ASI in general, check out http://asi.csuci.edu/.*\n\nI strongly recommend joining Student Government though. The CI Lobby Corps is going to become quite active over the next few months, so this would be just one of many great opportunities to gain experience in your field of study.\n\n\nFor a list of all the clubs on campus, check out Student Leadership Programs' website at http://www.csuci.edu/studentleadership/clubs-organizations/Clubs_Orgs_Directory.htm.",

They were nice people. \n\n\nAlso, I know this is unsolicited, but stay away from Rajmaria if you can. She's a lousy teacher and is quite dumb. My final semester she gave me an A- and messed with my GPA. Also, take Scholl and Grove if you can :D Political Sociology was a great class! Taught by someone from the soc department ad was fabulous. These were professors I had. \n\n",

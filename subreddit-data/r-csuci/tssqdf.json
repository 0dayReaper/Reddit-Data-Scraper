My biggest values are a college where people are nice, there's good student life, a lot of people living in the dorms, good classes, and a good study abroad program!",

This helps even after graduation.\n\nNot sure they're cons\n\nThe community is there if you find it.\n\nThere is food options on campus. Not sure if towncenter is still like a grocery store. In cas\u00e9 you don't wanna eat at pizza pie, island cafe, lighthouse, freudian sip, tortillas, all the time.\n\nThe pride is there. It's just shown different.\n\nThere's club and intramural. Having the sports you want would jack off tuition.\n\nGood or bad\n\nIf you're looking for a girl, you should be alright.\n\nThe haunted part can create convos.\n\nOnce you find friends, hang on to them.",

There are a lot of people in dorms though, and that's where most of the student life resides. The classes are solid and the professors are understanding, kind, and intelligent; to be fair though I only choose the favored professors from [ratemyprofessor.com](https://ratemyprofessor.com). Lastly, the transfer program has a lot of options and information, so I'd say it's solid as well.",

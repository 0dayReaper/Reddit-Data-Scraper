    "postText": "Hi I\u2019m new to Reddit so I have no clue how this works. I got it just to ask this question. I\u2019ll explain my situation.\n\n     I\u2019ll be a freshman this fall and I\u2019m in the process of deciding on a school. I got waitlisted at my UC choice and I won\u2019t hear till after May 1st (committing day for most colleges). So I\u2019m also planning on choosing another school in case I don\u2019t get off the waitlist. I\u2019m thinking of SBCC or CSUCI. Here\u2019s the thing. SBCC has the environment I think I want and it has a pretty good psychology program (after 2 years I\u2019ll transfer to the UC I\u2019m waitlisted at). But CSUCI has an amazing psychology program but I think it doesn\u2019t offer the right environment for me. (But I\u2019m not sure, I feel this way because of what I\u2019ve heard).\n     I\u2019m a quiet person but I am not shy. I\u2019m reserved definitely, but meeting people and being social is something I like. My first two years of HS I went to a small private school and had an extremely hard time making friends that lasted and who I felt were similar to me because I had so few people to meet and they were all very similar. I had smaller classes (usually 20, never more than 45) and I liked it but I also felt that I was under a microscope because of my anxiety/ social anxiety (I like meeting people yet I have social anxiety, ironic isn\u2019t it?). I transferred to a independent learning school my junior year where I took classes online/at home through textbook and met once a week with a teacher in person. I would also take classes at a local community college 3 days a week. \n     Now as a senior reflecting back on my HS experience I really wish I was in a place that had more types of people that allowed me to find my \u201cgroup\u201d. HS was pretty lonely for me but I feel like it\u2019s because of my environment at the time. If I was given a bigger pool with many different types of people I think I would have flourished. I want to have that opportunity in college. I don\u2019t want to have the same experience that I had in HS. I want to be exposed to all different types of people doing all sorts of things &amp; have the environment to support me being social and spending my free time in the social atmosphere. \n    Please tell me if my understanding of CSUCI isn\u2019t correct. I hear it\u2019s pretty empty on weekends, not very socially active and nearly all academics based. None of this things are bad at all, for some it\u2019s perfect. I just want to make sure it\u2019s what would work for me. I am worried I will spend a lot of money going here only to find myself struggling to find my people and not make up for the social life I didn\u2019t have in HS to then want to transfer or continue despite not enjoying my life socially. Or if I go to SBCC I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll regret not taking the opportunity to experience such an amazing psychology program. \nMainly I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m judging too harshly on CSUCI and their program should be enough for me to want to go/ worried I\u2019ll regret not taking a chance here and benefiting from its programs. Are you socially satisfied here?\n\nI appreciate you reading this. It\u2019s been on my mind 24/7 and I would love ANY advice , thoughts, tips etc. Whatever you feel inclined to say I would appreciate so much. Thank you!!!",

            "comment": "I went to cc and transferred to ci. In my opinion both schools will kinda be what you make it social wise. \n\nWhen I went to cc to make friends I had to join clubs and stuff because most peoplein class know their friends already or just want to do their work and leave. You have IV if you want parties for sbcc and you have santa barbara/Goleta. \n\nCsuci I'm at for 1 more semester. I didn't try to make friends but I'd say the vibe in general is friendlier from people. Not to say cc wasn't friendly you just needed to actively look for friends whereas csuci I've made friends without looking for them. Its in the middle of nowhere so if you want parties and stuff it won't happen really. Both schools have great academics",

            "comment": "CI is great if you don't mind a quiet, laid back campus. There are a lot of clubs and orgs to join if you want to meet people with similar interests but you kind of have to go out of your way to make those social connections. I can't speak to the psych program specifically but academic wise CI is awesome because the classes are so small so you can actually form relationships with your classmates and faculty. All that being said, starting at a CC and transferring is never a bad choice, you would save a lot of money while getting your GE classes out of the way. Hope this helps!",

I can't speak on behalf of the social life there since I've never been to campus due to coivd but I was also worried that once I do go to campus, I wasn't going to make friends because I'm pretty socially awkward. I still am worried but i heard that if you join clubs and other orgs, you should find friends.",

Pay attention closely and you\u2019ll start to notice everybody\u2019s little social quirks. We\u2019re all just trying to fit in. Also, I graduated from CSUCI with my masters and loved the campus environment. I hope you\u2019ll get to experience it after Covid. With campus housing, dorms, and the campus town center so close together it can be pretty lively at times.",

            "comment": "Hey, I'm a junior at CI and what I can tell you is that our campus is a laid back and quiet one. You won't get the hustle you would normally expect on a college campus, thus not a lot of exposure to a variety of people. With the pandemic reducing housing capacity I would expect even less than we already have. That being said, you have to look for a crowd, because our school is small and fall semester bodes even smaller numbers.\n\nHowever, CSUCI has a great club scene and you can find your people here if you actively look for them. We have semesterly events where folks recruit for clubs. \n\nIf you're dorming freshman year, you're most likely going to be heading to the Santa Rosa dorms, you share a room with 1-3 other people and a floor with 30ish other folks. For me, SR helped me find the friends I've been with for the ride so far. Leaving your door open when you don't mind having visitors really helps meeting new people while still being in your own space. For the freshman, there are special interest dorms like for multicultural community, the awesome nerd floor, and the STEM floor. Apply for these if you want an easier time meeting people cause everyone there will be at least sort of interested in similar things. However, these floors run out of spaces quickly so apply soonee rather than later if this is what you are looking for. \n \nI did a write up on the social scene of the campus a while ago, check my comment history for that if you want more. Hope this helps!",

Also, it's recommended to check your CIRecords to see exactly what you need to graduate. I graduated last semester, and I almost missed a couple of things which would have held me back. There are workshops at the start of each semester to walk you through CIRecords since it has a terrible interface.",

            "comment": "This is probably a little late, but here's another chart that shows pre-requisites: https://compsci.csuci.edu/degrees/bscs-chart.pdf. If you're pretty confident in your math skills, you might want to take MATH 150 Calculus I; otherwise, you can take MATH 105 Pre-Calculus. The MATH 399 labs are there to help you with the homework, so make sure you sign up for one, even if you might not need it!  It will give you upper-division credit, and the people teaching MATH 399 are very flexible about letting you show up to a different time slot. The MATH 230 Logic and Mathematical Reasoning class I took two years ago didn't actually use a lot of math but needed a lot of time to finish online homework, so it's okay to take that your first or second semester. I would definitely recommend COMP 105 Intro to Programming and taking some of your lower division General Education classes. COMP 150 Object-Oriented Programming can be challenging especially if you're new to coding or submitting your code to be graded, so I wouldn't recommend taking it your first semester, but it's an extremely valuable one to take next semester. Hope this helps!",

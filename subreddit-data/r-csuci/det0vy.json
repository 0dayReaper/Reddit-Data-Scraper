Does anyone have any advice for me about anything whether its school, housing, etc. Oh and what's the weather like over there because I'm hoping it's cooler than LA",

What major are you applying for if you don't mind me asking? \n\nAs for weather it should be a lot cooler as its closer the ocean.",

The traffic does seem horrible but i just don't know if i want to dorm and the off campus situation is kinda expensive. I do want the liberty of being free from rules from my parents too.. I'm 21 so that is kinda a big deal for me right now. Are you in LA county or south of it? Traffic is around 1hr20 from me.",

Yea being able to live on your own and be independent is really nice. You'll be able to form your own schedule and not worry about family responsibilities. Oh, same when I checked how far csuci is from where I'm at it said itll take about and hour and 20",

It\u2019ll save you a lot of stress on the day of since you won\u2019t be scrambling to see what you have to take. I planned out my schedule the night before my orientation and just plugged in the course numbers when we got to that portion of the day while everyone else was stressin out.",

This will show you what your community college classes covered and what classes are left to take at CI. This may or may not be there for you yet since it\u2019s still pretty far away from registration. Just a heads up too, if your major is like mine, only certain classes are available during the fall and some only during the spring. I suggest asking another upperclassmen or see your department head/counselor to see if yours has any. OH AND don\u2019t forget about your Upper Division General Ed courses!!!!",

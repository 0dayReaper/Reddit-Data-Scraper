    "postText": "Hi, \n\nI got accepted and I am in the process of confirming my enrollment. I was looking at the 4-year degree roadmap for a degree in computer science and I was wondering how long the classes are and how long an average school day is for someone in the computer science major that is completing their degree in 4 years. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks.",

If you\u2019re an incoming freshman (not a transfer), expect to be doing general education classes along with some beginning major classes. \n\nAs for the length of the school day, depends on how many units you\u2019ll be taking. Check out the schedule planner once you get around to enrolling in classes and it will generate multiple schedules using the classes you chose.",

            "comment": "General rule of thumb is 1 unit = 1 hour of class per week. If it is a 4 unit class, you usually have one 3-4 hour class, or two classes per week totaling around 4 hours of class. If you have a lab component, it may add one or two units, and thus one or two hours of class time - per week. You can make your schedule however you want, as long as the classes you need to take are available at multiple times during the week. You could (theoretically) shove all your classes for the entire week into 2 days, but they may be 8 hours a day or more. It's all about how productive you are. I've done it both ways,  the 2 days was great because I had the rest of the week to work an actual job to make money, but this actually hurt my studies more then helped, because I would \"never have time\" to study or do homework. I've done it the other way and had like one class a day for two to three hours and that was great too.",

            "comment": "Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures, Programming Languages, and Operating Systems all were 5 hours per week, split between two days. I think those were the longest I ever took in the major. I was able to have a few semesters with a four-day week, and it was really nice to have that extra day to recuperate. But like others have said, general rule is 1 unit = 1 hour. Typically, classes that are two hours or more take a break or two in between, so you don't usually have to sit through 3 straight hours of lecture.",

Spreading out my schedule worked better for me in terms of productivity.\n\nYes @ 1-to-1 unit-hour ratio.  My Fall 2019 schedule will have me at school MW 12pm-5pm, TR 10am-2pm, F 9am-12pm which includes CS 262+L, CS 232+L, and a buffet of math courses.  I'm at 16 units.\n\nIn my experience, the length of classes are generally either 1hr 15 mins (2-days/wk), 1 hr 50 mins (2 days/wk), or 2hrs 50 minutes (1-day/wk).",

    "postText": "I learned to play ultimate when I was in college and wanted to extend an invitation to our local college students at csuci to join us in some ultimate frisbee fun.\n\nI will try and keep the schedule updated here https://plus.google.com/communities/106613988788336495870\n\nI would really like to get a 2nd or 3rd game going in town near the college (village at the park / Lewis and Pleasant Valley area) I would be open to organizing a game on campus too.  Woodside Park (near 101 and Pleasant Valley) might be a good spot.\n\nPlease feel free to join the group and let's bring a greater Ultimate community to Camarillo.\n\n\n",

I was also a transfer and commuter but I usually ate at the Lighthouse grill in the student union building.  The food is good at both places from what I've had.  \n\nAt the cafe there's always a full salad bar and Mexican and Italian (Americanized staples e.g. tacos, burritos, spaghetti, pizza).  Then they usually have a set of entrees that change day-to-day.  It's also all you can eat if you stay there but you can also get a box to fill and take to go.\n\nThe Lighthouse grill has typical grill stuff: burgers, grilled chicken sandwiches, chicken strips and fries, etc.  It also has a small sandwich and salad made to order section.\n\nI don't know anything about the affordability of the meal plans, though.  I think the cafe is open this week for lunch, and doing reduced prices -- probably to sell people on meal plans.  Maybe swing by if you have a chance.",

The food is pretty good, it's all you can eat, and they can accommodate if there are any dietary restrictions (allergies, etc.).\n\nAlso, consider adding flex dollars onto your Dolphin ID as well so you can eat at the other campus dining locations (they are all pretty good).",

This is also how you add money onto your card for printing at CI.\n\nJust make sure you select Dolphin Cash when loading the money though. That way, the balance can be used for either dining or printing, not just dining exclusively (dining cash).\n\nHere's some information on the DOCKs:\n\nhttp://www.csuci.edu/cardservices/dock-information.htm",

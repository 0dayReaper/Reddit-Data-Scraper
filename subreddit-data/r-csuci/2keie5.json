    "postText": "Hello all, I am currently finishing up at a local CC and I am wondering if anyone can help to point me in the right direction. I have always been in love with your cozy campus culture and the allure of the Information Technology program offered. I want to ask anyone involved in the IT program about it's quality. Even if you are a Computer Science Major, I'd love t hear your answer as you are the majority.  How difficult do you find the classes? How relatable are the teachers? Are there many opportunities in the area for computer internships and preferably work?\n\nAdditionally I have questions about housing, I am over 21 so I'd like feedback from people who are in the same position. As far as I understand students like me re placed in the Town Center, correct?\nDoes anyone live off campus? If you do how hard was it to find an apartment, how affordable was it? I have a roommate in mind, my girlfriend, however I don't know what the rules and guidelines are for student housing so I thought I would explore my options. If anyone can help me to answer any of these questions I would greatly appreciate it.\n ",

            "comment": "Computer Science Major.\n\n&gt;How difficult do you find the classes?\n\nYour first year of computer science classes are incredibly easy. Programming languages, which you will take in your second year, is considered to be outstandingly difficult. If you can make it past that, you'll be okay.\n\n&gt;How relatable are the teachers?\n\nI don't know? I was never the kind of person to talk to professors very often. Most teachers are pretty accommodating, but I have had a few professors who are absolutely astounding and fun to be around and really care about their students. Most people will tell you that Gregory Wood in the physics department is super awesome. \n\n&gt;Are there many opportunities in the area for computer internships and preferably work?\n\nInternship opportunities are available, but as CSUCI does not have name recognition, you can't really coast by and just have a paying internship fall into your lap. Most of the talented Computer Science students I know had pretty steady employment by their second year. The computer science club, and the department as a whole, do a decent job of advertising internship opportunities. \n\n&gt; As far as I understand students like me re placed in the Town Center, correct?\n\nI do not live on campus, however I believe there are multiple places you can live, Town Center is among them.\n\n&gt;Does anyone live off campus?\n\nCSUCI is a commuter school, many people live off campus, myself included.\n\n\n&gt;If you do how hard was it to find an apartment, how affordable was it?\n\nMost of the people I know who live off campus either live with their parents, or rent a room in a house because apartments here can be expensive. You can generally find a room in a house for like 500-700 a month. ",

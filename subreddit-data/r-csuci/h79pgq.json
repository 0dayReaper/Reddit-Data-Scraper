    "postText": "Hi guys I\u2019m in a bit of a dilemma, Iam a transfer student that first applied to 3 university\u2019s for nursing as my major CSULA, CSULB, and CSUCI. I was all hopeful that I will get accepted, but I gotta denied from all three, except CSUCI had the alternative major, which I put Health Science. Now today with Covid-19 I went to campus with my family, and it was extremely far from where I live, I live in Korea town. The problem is I don\u2019t want to extend my time of education and I\u2019m Afraid that I won\u2019t get accepted into the community college program. I already submitted intent to enroll for health science, but have not submitted my official transcript, so should I continue to dual enrollment, or focus on something else?",

Stick to your major, wait out the current crisis, there's no hurry. Life may make you feel pressured to rush through. Don't. Take your time, stick to your goal of nursing, don't sacrifice your ideals.",

I had a pretty good GPA (3.8), so I figured I'd get in. Every single UC rejected me on my primary major of Computer Science, including UCSB, but they accepted me for Statistics and Data Science. I wasn't originally going to accept it, so I asked around and supposedly it was the same thing. Boy was that wrong. It wasn't even close to being the same thing, and to make it worse, the faculty was utter garbage. The quality of teaching was miles better in my community college. It was unacceptable, I could not believe I was seeing this at a supposedly prestigious school. After a year I transferred out and now I'm at CSUCI doing Computer Science and I couldn't be happier. Also, sorry for the super late reply lmao.",

I am definitely way more stressed when classes are on than I otherwise would be, and sometimes have to take days off from class just to breathe.\n\nHowever, this campus is great and I generally like all the staff I've interacted with.  \n\nWhy do you ask?",

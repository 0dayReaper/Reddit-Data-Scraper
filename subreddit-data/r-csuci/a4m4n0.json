    "postText": "I got accepted and im not sure. I'm scared im going to be wasting my time. Im currently a web developer and i dont have a bachelors in comp sci, its in business econ. I was hoping that this program would help me improve my development skills. I was looking at the course descriptions and none of them mention work with any actual programming languages or technologies. It seems just to be all vague theoretical concepts such as AI. Do these classes involve hands-on projects using programming languages? Or do you not really code for this program?",

Ultimately, if i want to get a masters i can always get it later. But if I did this program and it didnt prepare me to be a developer in the job market, then I most likely would never be able to go back and get a bachelor's. Plus I went to a coding bootcamp, so i can get a closely related job while I go to CLU, because all their classes are past 6pm. CSUCI would make me take a ton of undergrad courses only offered during the day. \n\nAlso after looking more into the curriculum, I see that a lot of the classes are high end research topics that would not really help me at all, and are rather more about math then they are about coding. I found that employers are really just interested in candidates that understand the fundamentals that you get from a bachelors (most employers, not all)",

I'm mostly interested in pursuing a PhD and this is my stepping stone because I got my undergrad in a lib arts. The classes definitely seem theoretical, but the research papers seem fairly hands on. Most of the student research papers on Michael S's website seem to have some real code.\n\nI think this is a traditional Computer Science Master's program. Sounds like you might be interested in a professional program. Professional programs anticipate you going directly into industry after the fact and usually push you into more hands-on courses. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEither way, let me know what you decide. It'd be nice to get to know someone going there. I'm pretty sure I'll be going in the Fall. ",

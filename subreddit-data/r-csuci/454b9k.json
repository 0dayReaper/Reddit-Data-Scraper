Also I'm at a bit of a crossroad since I don't know the first thing about running a club, any faculty willing to support this project, or if it would even be allowed.\n\nDoes anybody have any tips?",

They may be able to guide you from there.\n\nHere are a few random tips (in no particular order) \u2014 request $$ from Associated Students Inc. (ASI) for club events &amp; supplies; use FB to gauge interest in your club and then create a FB page when the club is official; if you serve as the president of your club, check your email frequently and make sure the club doesn't miss any filing deadlines each semester and/or academic year (that way, the club will remain recognized by the university); have a presence at major school events (Discover CI, club fairs, etc.).\n\nBest of luck!",

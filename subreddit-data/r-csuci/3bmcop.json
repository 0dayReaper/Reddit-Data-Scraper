I love anime and love having a good laugh. I am always there for others and actually listen to what they need to say. If you want a friend as well and can share a little about yourself that would be great. I am a Psychology major and I am shy. ",

Remember, that you are joining a club of people like yourself who are just as awkward and shy. Unfortunately, you are the one who needs to take more steps forward in those environments. You will make friends!",

There's no need to worry about being shy since anime is something you really enjoy and you will be in the presence of others who love anime so they may start off the conversations. Find out when the first meeting of the semester starts, and try to go the first day so that there are others who are new to the club, you'll have a better chance of getting into a group rather then going mid semester when most people have a set group they hang out with.",

Try to find a group that likes the same anime as you, or let the club president know that you would like to set up some kind of anime marathon club day where a bunch of kids from the club go to a theater room or someone elses dorm room and just marathon watches a new or popular anime, and you can make it a pot luck where people bring food or snacks to share with everyone. I know that a lot of people in anime clubs are super nice and are always up to talk about anime or watch some with you. ",

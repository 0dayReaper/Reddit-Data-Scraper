In considering what school to choose I'm trying to find out the good  and the bad about each.\n\nSo what  would you all say is the nice things about Pomona and what makes you go  \"This freaking school....\" Im looking more f=at the \"quality of life\"  things, like things being a PITA that really shouldn't be.\n\nAnything in particular I should know/consider?\n\nPoly Sci major btw.\n\nMy other choices are SLO, Pomona, and Bakersfield.",

            "comment": "CI lacks many of the things that make it feel like a university, it feels like an extension of community college. Parking lots are poorly maintained and placed in pretty inconvenient locations around campus - shouldn't be too big of an issue if you plan on taking transit. Not a lot to do in the surrounding area either unless you drive for a while in either direction.\n\nAlmost everything about Cal Poly SLO is great, it's an awesome school.",

            "comment": "Whatever you do, don\u2019t go to Bakersfield. Bakersfield is the armpit of California and I don\u2019t understand why anyone would willingly put themselves through that when they have other options. \n\nThe town of SLO is amazing, you\u2019re on the beach and everyone I know has really enjoyed the campus and quality of teachers. There\u2019s also a lot of opportunities to make friends. If I could do it over, I would probably go there.\n\nI\u2019m personally a commuter to CSUCI but I\u2019m a non-traditional student who\u2019s almost 30 so I\u2019m not looking for your typical college experience. CSUCI is a great school and you will receive a quality education but you\u2019re essentially in the suburbs and the campus is pretty mellow so you wont get the same social experience as schools like Cal Poly.",

            "comment": "Given your major and that list of schools, I would say go to CI. The Poli Sci/Global studies faculty are awesome. Yes, the school is largely commuter and it does not have the \"traditional\" college life. On the other hand, students work closely with students, and students can apply for funds for their research and/or to attend conferences.  Students are encouraged to work across disciplines (interested in Politics/policy and environmental science, you can do both!) Great hiking trails are 10 minutes from campus. Just depends on what you want.",

            "comment": "I went to Pomona for a year during the pandemic and I transferred to CI because it\u2019s close to home.\n\nIn comparison, here are the notable differences in my opinion:\n- CI is smaller than Pomona\n- Not sure where you live, but Pomona is in a densely populous area and CI is the opposite. It\u2019s quaint and peaceful.\n- Crime rates in the city of Pomona is concerning. A lot of students talked about the gang presence all over the city, but CI is in a very safe city. Not very much crime goes on in Camarillo or Ventura County in general.\n- There are more fast food options at Pomona like Subway and I believe they also have a Starbucks. CI has a Starbucks, but the food options are okay. They aren\u2019t like Pomona in that sense. \n\nUltimately, SLO seems like the best option out of your choices. Message me if you have any questions, I\u2019d be happy to help.",

    "postText": "Hey there, future Fall transfer here. I'm planning on living off-campus and have been in the process of apartment hunting the last few weeks. Has anyone had any experience with this and have any apartment complexes worth considering? Any decent condos/townhomes/mobile homes? I've been eyeing some of the newer ones near Riverpark in Oxnard, the studios are going for around 2300. Thanks!",

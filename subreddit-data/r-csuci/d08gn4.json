I'd be a pain in the ass and ask parking guys in Placer Hall everyday if they know if the EVs in the charging stations have been there past the allotted time.",

Administration needs to realize this is a problem, but students need to make their voices heard that there aren't enough charging stations or they are being hogged.",

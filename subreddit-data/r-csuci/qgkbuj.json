I'm going to the pumpkin carving on Friday, and something called Creepy creations, on Wednesday. \n\nAside from campus events, I'm also going to a haunted house called Reign of Terror, runs until Nov 6, has 130 rooms, seems like a big thing. I can send you the link if you'd like. I'm going on Saturday at 7pm",

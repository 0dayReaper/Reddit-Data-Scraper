I can't comment on which is better, but geographically Town Center is a bit farther away from where most classrooms are.\n\nDepending on your financial situation, also consider looking for a decent studio or 1bed apartment in Camarillo. You get your own space, and even better if you find a roommate to split the cost with. I pay about $1,000 a month (split a $2,250 1 bed apt with my partner) and school is only an 8 minute drive.",

You will fill out a survey form and they will try to place you with people your age and common schedules (noise, sleeping hours. Etc).",

I got accepted into the Health Science program, but am interested in Public Health, or maybe Community Health Education. (not sure what I want to pursue yet, but maybe thinking Public Policy)? I\u2019m wondering if anyone in either area has insight what it was/what it\u2019s like for them? thank you in advance!",

    "postText": "Guild website: http://flattire.enjin.com\n\nFlat Tire is a World of Warcraft guild located on the Alliance side of the Windrunner server. (Windrunner is a US Pacific Time server located in the Los Angeles area.)\n\nOur guild was built as a local guild for Ventura County residents who want to play World of Warcraft with nearby gamers. As a local guild, we go beyond holding guild events in-game -- we regularly plan offline events as well. Join us, and you'll be able to meet up with your fellow guildies and make some local friends! The guild was officially launched in-game on Saturday November 10th of 2012, immediately following our first face-to-face meet and greet. With the recent launch of Mists of Pandaria, right now feels like the perfect time to unite people to share the exciting experience of exploring the game's new content. Veteran players, returning players (like myself), and new players are all welcome in our guild. Both \"hardcore\" and \"casual\" gamers are welcome to join us as well. We do our best to create events for ALL types of players. Interested in joining us? Then all you need to do is visit the link above to go to our guild website, and fill out the form on our Recruitment page to notify us that you need an invitation. We'll get in touch with you right away! Need some convincing first? Then please, read on.\n\nThe primary purpose of this guild is to connect local gamers with each other in order to develop an accepting community and real friendships where gamers of all types can feel comfortable being themselves. With that said about being accepting all types of players, there is no target age group that this guild is going to be built around. We have players of all ages. However we do ask that members at least be old enough to have graduated high school. We apologize if this disqualifies any interested people from joining us, but our guild expects its members to have the ability to transport themselves to our out-of-game events if they wish to come, as well as the ability to provide the finances for their own game subscription without relying on outside sources. This is because our guild leader needs to know that he can count on people to stick to their RSVPs for guild events, so that he can effectively plan for our exciting guild activities. As a result, our guild is made up completely of 18+ adults.\n\nAs we are all adults, we do not feel the need to censor language in guild chat. However, while we are definitely a guild that knows how to joke around, we still expect our guildies to use their best judgement about what is acceptable. We are a guild built on acceptance of our fellow guildies above all else, so any sexist, racist, or other comments that make a fellow guild member feel like they are unwelcome will not be tolerated. Please also make sure that speaking with the guild in a voice chat environment is something that you are comfortable with and willing to do while participating in in-game guild events.\n\nAs we have mentioned, guild events will exist not only in-game, but out-of-game as well. In-game guild events will include the establishment of a raid team when the guild ends up becoming large enough, but we currently do not have enough end-game members to form an effective raid team. When we do have enough people, we may do heroic or normal raiding, but the decision about raid difficulty will depend both on the skill and the desires of our players, as the primary goal in all guild events will be for us to enjoy our time together as a guild. If you are looking for an extremely hardcore raiding team, then please note that I can not say at this point in time whether or not this will be something that our guild will eventually offer. It is still something that is on the table, but it is a bridge that we will not be crossing until the time comes, as it is simply too soon for us to make predictions. While not mandatory by any means, raids would be the ONLY event in which a relative commitment would be expected of those interested in forming the core team, and day/time of raids will be decided as a team when that time comes.\n\nPvP events will also be regularly scheduled for any guildies who are interested. These events will include arenas and/or rated battlegrounds, depending on the number of interested participants. However, I should point out that Windrunner is a PvE server. A PvE server was chosen for our guild in order to keep the atmosphere relaxed enough for all types of local players to feel like they can join us, and it also allows the stress-free leveling of new characters to be possible for all of those people who are starting new characters for the purpose of joining the guild.\n\nAgain, no in-game event is ever going to be mandatory. In-game events, ranging from dungeons and raids to PVP and social events, will all be posted in the in-game calendar well in advance in order to allow for interested guild members to sign up. In the case of an event that can only accommodate a limited number of players, the chronological order of sign-ups is what will be used in order to determine the order of invites sent out at the time of the in-game event.\n\nAs for out-of-game events, the entire point of a local guild is to create the opportunity for building real life friendships with other people who share an interest in WoW, so we regularly schedule offline guild meet-ups. These meetings greatly vary in purpose, most often being purely social opportunities, but sometimes focusing on the organized discussion of important guild-related topics. Our next event is going to be trying our luck as a team in an evening of bar trivia, and then we have a pot luck, a bowling night, and an evening of go-kart racing all in the middle of being planned. Much like in-game events, the attendance of real life events is not going to be mandatory. However, do note that it is naturally assumed that people who join a local guild will at least show a little bit of interest in attending a real life meeting from time to time, so please make sure that the concept of a local guild appeals to you before asking to join. After all, real life socializing is the entire point of a local guild, and will therefore be a crucial part of our guild's mission. If you have absolutely zero interest in socializing with your guildies in real life, then it's quite likely that you would be better served by searching for a guild that has a mission more in line with your own. (While we are primarily a local guild, exceptions are of course made for any members who wish to invite their long-distance family and/or friends to join them in our guild!)\n\nPlease make sure that you are comfortable with sharing your Facebook contact information with the guild leader. All of our out-of-game events will be posted on the in-game calendar, on the guild's own website, and in our Facebook group, however only the RSVPs on Facebook will be used for the planning of offline events. These offline events are only being put on the in-game calendar and our own website in order to keep people more aware of them. If you notice a face-to-face event on the in-game calendar or this website and you would like to attend it, then please make sure that you sign up for the event on Facebook.\n\nIf you would like to join our guild, then please visit our website, click on the Recruitment tab, and fill out the form that is found there. This will notify us of your interest and we'll be sure to get in touch with you to arrange your invitation right away. The link to our website is at the top of this listing. We can't wait to hear from you, and hope to meet you soon! ",

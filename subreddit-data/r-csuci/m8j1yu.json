    "postText": "**Approved by the CSULB IRB**\n\n# Introduction to my accessibility study\n\nHello!    My name is Nicholas Matthews. I am disabled (deaf), and I am also a   doctoral  student in Educational Leadership at California State   University, Long  Beach. I am looking for college students with   disabilities to be in a  research study I am doing.\n\nThe    title of my study is \u201cAccessible Instructional Materials and Disabled    Student Success.\u201d Instructional materials are things like videos,    webpages, and files that students use in a college course. Instructional    materials are accessible if they can easily be used and understood by    students with disabilities. For example, videos with closed captions   are  accessible to deaf students like me.\n\nIf    you are a college student, I would like to ask you about the    accessibility of your instructional materials. With my study, I hope to    show that accessible instructional materials are important for  students   like you. My study will show if students with disabilities  learn more  in  their classes when their materials are accessible.\n\n# How to participate\n\nTo    be in my study, you must be at least 18 years old and have a    disability. You should also have taken one or more classes at a college    or university in the Fall 2020 term. Finally, you should understand  the   informed consent notice on the first page of the survey. If you do  not   understand the informed consent notice, you should not  participate in   this study.\n\nBeing  in my study is   voluntary. This means you can choose whether to be in  my study or not.   You should participate in my study only if you really  want to.\n\nIf   you choose to be in  my study, you will take an online survey through a   website called  Qualtrics. I will not ask you for any personal   information, like your  name or student ID number. However, I will ask   you for the name of  your college and the name of a class you took at   your college. Your  answers will be kept private, so that only the   researcher and his  supervisors will see them. The survey should take   between 15 and 45  minutes of your time.\n\n# Take the survey\n\n[To take part in the study, please visit this Qualtrics survey](https://csulb.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2sjYtIYo0GLAwNo).\n\nYou    can take the survey any time before March 26. The survey should be    accessible for users with disabilities. If you have difficulty taking    the survey or have any questions or concerns about my study, please feel    free to contact me. Thank you for your time!\n\nSincerely,\n\nNicholas Matthews  \nDepartment of Educational Leadership  \nCalifornia State University, Long Beach  \n[Nicholas.Matthews@csulb.edu](mailto:Nicholas.Matthews@csulb.edu)",

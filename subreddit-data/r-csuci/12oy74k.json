            "comment": "I graduated back in 2013, but I was considerably older than the majority of other students- closer in age to some of the younger staff.  I consider myself to be social but shy, meaning that I wanted to find more social experiences, but didn't because of my shyness and feeling slightly out of place due to my age.  So I mostly kept to the school work.  I joined a social club related to my degree and met a few people, but nothing that was very meaningful, though I'm sure if I engaged more things would have been different- everyone was very welcoming and kind.",

I\u2019ve had several older folks in tons of my classes, and they\u2019re always such friendly and wonderful people.",

I would say it be hard socially if you want to make a connection just because it\u2019s a commuter school, but if you really engage and try to make connections just really engage in activities around campus and clubs a great place to start also.",

But having a live friendly person pick up the phone when you call admissions \u2026 it just feels so good :) \nI met with the chair of the Art department yesterday and she had her assistant pick me up (!) on a golf cart and drive me from my car to the ceramics studio - because I casually mentioned recent knee injury in my email. \nIt was kinda embarrassing yet very special all at the same time.",

Universities pretty much across the board are expecting an enrollment cliff because of childless elder millennials, the rising costs of *gestures broadly*, the pandemic, etc. They are looking for new ways to support non-traditional students, and what their needs might be. Some non-traditional students may have delayed going to college or are interested in re-skilling for a changing job market. All to say, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d be welcomed with open arms! No matter where you decide to go I highly recommend taking advantage of every service campus offers, and making the time to meet with your professors during office hours. Feel free to DM me if you have any other questions!",

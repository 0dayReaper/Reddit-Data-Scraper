    "postText": "I know parking at CI can get pretty crazy since it's a commuter school. I know it probably depends on the time of day, but how early would you say you would have to arrive before your first class at CI to find parking?\n\nAlso, I heard that you can park at the Camarillo train station and then take a bus to CI, which is much cheaper and much less hassle. Has anyone does this? How long is the drive/is it faster than trying to find parking?",

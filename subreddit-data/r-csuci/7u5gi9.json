    "postText": "Good  afternoon everyone. I had the most absolute brilliant idea, I\u2019m going to start a club on campus. But not just any club, this one will require next to zero budget, no commitment, and nothing to compromise anyone\u2019s monotonous academic schedule.\n\nI wish to be the founder of CSUCI\u2019s Dank Meme Club\n\nBasically a club where we hang out somewhere, preferably the Santa Rosa kitchen to cook food, and maybe have a PowerPoint of the best memes we find that week. And on club days we wouldn\u2019t even need to bake anything, just hand out printed out memes! \n\nSo basically I need like a minimum number of people, and some people to be officers. \n\nCome on, it\u2019ll be fun. A free Tide pod to whoever joins me",

The allure of this club is requiring basically zero effort. Plus i mean there\u2019s a Pok\u00e9mon club for crying out loud so this shouldn\u2019t be hard to propose. ",

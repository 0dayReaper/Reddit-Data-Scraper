I wish to create a sense of community on campus and foster positive identity development within Muslim students on campus! \n\nIf you know anyone who might also be interested, please share this flyer with them! You do not need to be Muslim to join. If you have a friend who might not want to reach out because they\u2019re a little shy, join them! Thank you for taking the time to read this!",

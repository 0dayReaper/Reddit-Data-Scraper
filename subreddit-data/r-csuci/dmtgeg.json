What is the campus life like and how are the professors? Is it expensive? Honestly, any information or personal thoughts about the school life would be great. I've seen virtual tours of the campus and have read some reviews about it. It looks like a a great place to be, I'm just a really indecisive person.",

The people are all so nice and the small class sizes let you form real connections with the professors and they really want you to succeed! And, for the record, the food is pretty great too compared to some campus' I saw before I came here.",

It\u2019s a commuter school so it\u2019s can be quiet on campus but it\u2019s pretty here and it\u2019s close to the beach. I also love working in the library.",

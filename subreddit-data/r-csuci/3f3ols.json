Check out Dolphin CareerLink, it's where loads of on-campus and off-campus jobs are posted.\n\n\nOn-campus jobs are arguably the most flexible with schedules, but there are catches. You will not work more than 20 hrs per week, and you'll receive a steady wage (no bonuses/overtime/holiday pay/raises). But it's lots of fun; I worked on campus and ended up making lots of friends and meeting way more people.\n\n\nCheck it out and see what you find!",

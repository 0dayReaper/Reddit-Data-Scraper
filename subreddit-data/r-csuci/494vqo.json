That trip to Staples Center today? I found out just now, after it finished (apparently, the Ducks won.)\n\nAm I the only one with this problem, or is there really an issue with the flow of information concerning student involvement at our school?",

I suggest liking the following pages to get this information in the future:\n\n1) Student Programming Board\n2) CSU Channel Islands Student Government\n3) The CI View Student Newspaper\n4) The Nautical Yearbook\n5) CI Student Union\n\nMany of them have Instagram accounts too (visit their pages to find their usernames).\n\nAlso, check CI Sync (access it through myCI) for event info and other campus activities.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nEDIT: Sorry for the poor formatting...

The Ducks game was advertised on a big chalk sign on the sidewalk for like, weeks. Pretty sure I saw stuff about it in the SUB too. I've never really had an issue with it but I spend a lot of time in the SUB so I see all the fliers and such.",

Or at least that's how it's been for me. The earliest we're able to submit a request is a week before the event, and that doesn't mean that fliers will get posted that day either.",

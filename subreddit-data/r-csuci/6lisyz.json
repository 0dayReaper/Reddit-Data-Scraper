I called the FA Office and they said that nobody is allowed to accept their awards yet and that it was only for view. I checked today and not only are the awards gone but it also states that I haven't applied for the 2017 FAFSA. Is there a reason for this and has anyone else experienced that same thing? ",

CSUCI only just started to award students their actual financial aid. \n\nMine showed up last week but before that I was getting the same message about not having applied for the 2017 FAFSA (which isn't true of course). Keep checking your portal, your awards should be showing up soon!\n\nIf you're unsure or don't see your awards in the next week or two I would definitely give the Financial Aid Office a call just to ease your worries.",

    "postText": "I'm a new transfer student and while I have my own car, I think the parking permit fee per semester is pretty steep at $185.\n\nAt 2 trips a day, 2 times a week for 4 months, I calculate 64 trips to school. Multiplied by $1.25 fare is $80.\n\nIs it a good idea (safety wise) to park a car at the Camarillo Metrolink station and then take the [VISTA](http://www.goventura.org/?q=travel-ventura/vista/routes-schedules/routes/vista-csuci-camarillo-weekday) bus to campus?\n\nHas anyone here done this before? Is it too inconvenient?\n\nPs. Is it easy to find parking on campus when you have a permit?",

            "comment": "Slow down on the math! bus pass costs only $25 for a semester :) Great deal. They can be bought at Placer Hall (police station). I don't think parking fills up on campus, although its a bit of a walk from front lot to bell tower and such. Buses are very clean and not too crowded, and the pass gives you access to the other local buses (I don't have a car so its pretty useful for me). Metrolink's lot isn't super big but I take Amtrak a lot and have never seen it full. \n\nI don't know anyone who has done the Metrolink parking, but hopefully this information helps.",

You can park across the tracks and walk over the pedestrian bridge -- it is just really out if the way. \n\nYou can buy a bus pass on a per semester basis too. It comes out to much less than $80 paying for every fare. ",

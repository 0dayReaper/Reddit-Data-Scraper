There's always a meal plan included, so you'll have to weigh that into what you're spending. I had both a single and a double at different times (double in housing I think they no longer use anymore). But if you can apply early, and for a single, it's definitely worth it. It's usually like 3-6 in a suite, depending on the style. Good sized common area tho, enough for a tv, couch and a few chairs. Decent kitchen too. If you're over 21, they have dorms for you so you can drink. It never got really super loud, and with the window shut it was never a problem. Don't really ever get a chance to switch roommates(some exceptions), but never really had a huge problem with any. RAs are pretty chill so nothing too bad. Driving off campus for needing anything into town sucks, and the local mart is only really good for beer and maybe snacks. Dining all is actually great. Good food and tons of options. You can only get a togo box if you're not eating in the lounge tho. There's study rooms too for each dorm that are pretty awesome and you can be up all night in there need be. Laundry rooms on site were great, and weren't too expensive last I checked. Gym on campus is meh. Way tiny. ",

            "comment": "Hi there. Just graduated in December, and lived in both dorms (Anacapa &amp; Town Center) where transfer students will be placed. The Anacapa dorms are all single rooms (there are 4 bedrooms in each apt) however some people can opt to double up. This may also happen if theres not enough housing space for demand. The town center apartments are two bedroom 3 people apartments (One double occupancy bedroom and one single bedroom), one bedroom double occupancy, and single studios for one person. I personally has a single studio last semester and it was great but there are a limited number. I paid I believe $7k for one semester for the single studio, and approximately $6k each semester last year when I was in a double in Anacapa. \n\nThe current housing costs are listed on CSUCI's housing page, along with details about each building. I personally decided to go with a single studio (and got lucky getting it, they were all filled up within a matter of one minute after the room selection opened) because I'm married and had some troubles with roommates previously. I also did not have a car, and I went to Canada during my breaks so it made sense to stay on campus despite the higher costs. \n\nI would recommend that all students live on campus for at least their first year because it makes it easy to find and make friends. The most common complaint that Commuters have is the lack of social events for commuters to bring school spirit and comraderie, so living on campus makes it easy because you'll be more likely to attend events since you're already there.

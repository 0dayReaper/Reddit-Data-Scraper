I get out of class around 1pm and was trying to make it to my job in old town Camarillo by 1:15ish. Is the traffic exiting CI pretty bad?",

Plenty of MC parking at all hours of the day and night.\n\nTaking the VCTC from the Centrepoint in Oxnard or Metrolink Station in Camarillo is another alternative. The only downside is that you have to take the VCTC.\n\nAlso, beware of the school police. They like to set up speed traps at the entrances and exits. Watch your speed and use your signals going in and coming out.",

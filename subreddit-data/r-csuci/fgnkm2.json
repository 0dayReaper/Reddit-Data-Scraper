    "postText": "Here's information I've already sent to the Camarillo City Council and it's basically paraphrased of the info I sent President Beck urging the school to go online-only from Spring Break if not earlier: \n\nHow far are we from having the City of Camarillo STAY HOME, and SPREAD OUT on the hopefully-rare occurrence of HAVING to leave the house/unit? The VC Star has reported that Ventura County's first COVID-19 patient had visited a clinic on Arneill Rd in Camarillo, meeting with at LEAST 5 workers INCLUDING a doctor, AFTER coming home from the cruise and BEFORE getting tested for COVID-19. The spread of the new disease may be approaching Camarillo as we speak. PLEASE start HEAVILY encouraging Camarillo to stay home to slow/prevent spread of COVID-19! \n \nScientists have so far deduced that between 20% and 70% of the ENTIRE world's population WILL contract COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) over the next two years. Of that population which will contract COVID-19, about 15% WILL need ventilators (breathing machines) and oxygen for WEEKS to survive the illness. This means that over the next two years, between 3% and 12% of the ENTIRE human population WILL need to be on ventilators and oxygen for WEEKS, SOLELY to survive COVID-19 infection. Does Camarillo or even Ventura County as a whole even HAVE enough ventilators or oxygen to have 12% of its residents on ventilators and oxygen at the same time for WEEKS? \n\nBasically, we NEED to MAKE and ENFORCE a culture of STAYING HOME and STRONG social distancing NOW, before COVID-19 fully invades Camarillo and introduces REAL nightmare scenarios like THIS (a comment that as posted in the Facebook group \"Camarillo Concerns\" just YESTERDAY): \n\nPLEASE READ!!!!!\n\nTwitter post: From a well respected friend and intensivist/A&amp;E consultant who is currently in northern Italy:\n\n1/ \u2018I feel the pressure to give you a quick personal update about what is happening in Italy, and also give some quick direct advice about what you should do.\n\n2/ First, Lumbardy is the most developed region in Italy and it has a extraordinary good healthcare, I have worked in Italy, UK and Aus and don\u2019t make the mistake to think that what is happening is happening in a 3rd world country.\n\n3/ The current situation is difficult to imagine and numbers do not explain things at all. Our hospitals are overwhelmed by Covid-19, they are running 200% capacity\n\n4/ **We\u2019ve stopped all routine, all ORs have been converted to ITUs and they are now diverting or not treating all other emergencies like trauma or strokes. There are hundreds of pts with severe resp failure and many of them do not have access to anything above a reservoir mask.**\n\n5/ Patients above 65 or younger with comorbidities are not even assessed by ITU, I am not saying not tubed, I\u2019m saying not assessed and no ITU staff attends when they arrest. Staff are working as much as they can but they are starting to get sick and are emotionally overwhelmed.\n\n6/ My friends call me in tears because they see people dying in front of them and they con only offer some oxygen. Ortho and pathologists are being given a leaflet and sent to see patients on NIV. PLEASE STOP, READ THIS AGAIN AND THINK.\n\n7/ **We have seen the same pattern in different areas a week apart, and there is no reason that in a few weeks it won\u2019t be the same everywhere, this is the pattern:**\n\n8/ **1)A few positive cases, first mild measures, people are told to avoid ED but still hang out in groups, everyone says not to panick**\n\n**2)Some moderate resp failures and a few severe ones that need tube, but regular access to ED is significantly reduced so everything looks great**\n\n9/ 3)Tons of patients with moderate resp failure, that overtime deteriorate to saturate ICUs first, then NIVs, then CPAP hoods, then even O2.\n\n4)Staff gets sick so it gets difficult to cover for shifts, mortality spikes also from all other causes that can\u2019t be treated properly.\n10/ Everything about how to treat them is online but the only things that will make a difference are: do not be afraid of massively strict measures to keep people safe,\n\n11/ if governments won\u2019t do this at least keep your family safe, your loved ones with history of cancer or diabetes or any transplant will not be tubed if they need it even if they are young. By safe I mean YOU do not attend them and YOU decide who does and YOU teach them how to.\n12/ Another typical attitude is read and listen to people saying things like this and think \u201cthat\u2019s bad dude\u201d and then go out for dinner because you think you\u2019ll be safe.\n\n13/ We have seen it, you won\u2019t be if you don\u2019t take it seriously. I really hope it won\u2019t be as bad as here but prepare.\n PLEASE make the right choice. Our wonderful community will suffer SO much less for it. \n\n**PLEASE send this info to as MANY authorities and entities as possible! COVID-19 must be slowed/prevented as MUCH as possible for ALL our safeties and happiness!**",

If the education is worse then do I get some kind of compensation? There is no chance we see any of the charges they force on us like the health services that just tell you to go to a doctor. Or get the campus gym membership fee back. It is frustrating that I am losing part of the education I paid for.",

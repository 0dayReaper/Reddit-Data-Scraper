I thought it would be fun to make new friends, but then it dawned on me, I'm a commuter. I can't meet dorm mates, and then meet their friends, and find a clique. I've taken to playing Dark Souls in the library, but obviously that's not helping.",

Based on the first month,  however, it seems like people stay in dorms or library. Everywhere else seems empty. At least that's what it seems like to me, which is why I'd rather play games in the library, with at least people around, than in the lounge in Anacapa that looks like it hasn't been touched in months.",

            "comment": "Here's my advice:\n\n* Join a few clubs that you're interested in. All you need to do is find out when they meet and simply show up to the meetings. Eventually, you'll meet a bunch of like-minded people this way. Don't be afraid to try something new! You can find a list of all the CI clubs and organizations here: http://ci.orgsync.com/. If you can't find a club meeting time/location, use that list to look up their President or Vice President in CI's campus directory (Link: http://ciapps.csuci.edu/directory/) and email them (almost every club wants more members, so they should respond fairly quickly).\n\n* Go to the campus and student organization events! There are so many of them, and a lot of them have free food too. The events can be found on that same page where clubs can be found. Also, there's another campus calendar here: http://ciapps.csuci.edu/Events (probably a better calendar in my opinion).\n\n* Work out at the CI Recreation Center and try to participate in one of their intramural sports leagues or classes (they're all included with your tuition). Check out Campus Recreation website for more information: http://www.csuci.edu/recreation/.\n\nHere's an article that might be helpful too (minus the rushing frats and sororities part... CI only has one sorority right now and no frats): http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Friends-in-College\n\nFeel free to PM me if you have any questions about CI itself. Hope this helped and best of luck!",

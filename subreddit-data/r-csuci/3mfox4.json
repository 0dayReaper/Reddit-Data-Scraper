I have no previous experience with CS. I'm actually a bio &amp; psych major at CI, but I love learning! Any sort of guidance and even websites would be helpful! Thank you! ",

            "comment": "If you're thinking of doing it for academic purposes related to CSUCI (thinking of possibly pursuing CS), I would recommend Html / JavaScript, Java or a c-based language like c, c++ or c#.  These languages are widely used within the industry as well as the CS bachelor's pipeline.\n\nIf you're doing it purely for the sake of entertainment or personal growth, I'd suggest going web based at first (html, JavaScript, maybe jQuery or eventually a more advance web-based language like PHP or ASP.NET), as it will get you the quickest results, and you'll still be getting yourself some useful skills (and you'll be able to share them online).\n\nA good way to decide what you want to learn, is to think of something you want to try and make, and then research different languages to see which would best suite the task.\n\nEither way, you can't go wrong.  Good luck!",

            "comment": "Java. It's the language most people at CI are familiar with because Comp 150 is taught in it, which is taken by math, cs, it, and a few other students.\n\n[Here](http://codingbat.com/java/Warmup-1) is an online guide for learning Java. You may have to do some learning on your own, but the exercises are structured well.\n\nStack Overflow and /r/LearnProgramming are both useful places if you get stuck.\n\nIf you really want to learn Java, I suggest taking Comp 150 with Anna Bieszczad. As far as I know, the only pre req is Calc 1. I personally didn't find the course particularly difficult, but I did come out of it feeling very comfortable with Java, and that class was basically enough to land me a programming job that summer.\n\nJava is the language Android apps are coded in, and it very similar to C#, which is the coding language used by the Unity game engine (The engine used by Monument Valley, Cities: Skyline, Kerbal Space Program, and other games). So if you know Java, you can make android apps, build video games, and there are libraries (external tools) that let you basically do everything else. ",

Other languages are easy to pick up after.\n\nJava: Learn for the intro to Object Oriented Design. Easy to use and learn as well as works on almost every computer. (Similar to C#, the Microsoft Java)\n\nPython: Learn for the intro to scripting languages. Very easy to use and have a massive user base.\n\nC++: Further Object Oriented play and pointers. A lot of industry is not high level programming so you can get some exposure to C this way.",

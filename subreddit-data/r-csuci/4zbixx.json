    "postText": "I just found this and wanted to see if it's still active. I'm a new local transfer student majoring in business. I'm looking forward to starting my first semester although I'm not sure what to expect from the business classes. If anyone has any input on the business classes or program overall that would be great. \n\nI'd also like to get involved in clubs, does anyone know if there's like a day where all the clubs try to recruit people by setting up tables and providing information? \n\nHope to meet some of you once school starts!

Your question is a little broad, so all I can really say is the program is wonderful. Best piece of advice is get to know Andrew Morris (business/econ chair) well. You probably saw him speak at the orientation. He is a wonderful man, and helped me navigate some of the bureaucracy quite tactfully. Great guy to have in your corner. Also a great professor (had him for management of org and ethics). One last bit of advice is get on those UDIGEs early lol. You can even double pop at least one with things like your language requirement too. Hollar if you have any more specific questions and good luck next week! ",

I'm currently on the waitlist for the business and economics in literature course. Are you in the business club or heard about what they're about? I'm looking at potentially joining. Thanks once again and congrats on almost graduating! ",

Unfortunately I am the last person to ask for club/extracurricular info... in my 30s and work full time, so I pretty much show up for my classes and run :P ",

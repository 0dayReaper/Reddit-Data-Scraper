            "comment": "The University Glen community has their own set of parking permits. You'll get ticketed up there without their specific permit.\n\nAs of right now, the VISTA bus is your best bet for cheaper parking. The pass is $21.87 for the summer session and parking is usually plentiful at the Amtrak/Metrolink station it picks up at in Old Town Camarillo. There are no side streets remotely close to campus that can be used for parking (at least without a ticket). The hours for that bus' summer operation are a joke though (7am - 5:30pm Mon.-Fri.; 7:30am-5:30pm Sat.; doesn't run Sun. at all).\n\nVista bus @ CI information: http://www.csuci.edu/publicsafety/parking/vista-bus.htm\n\n------\n\nTo OP - my personal suggestion would be to multiply how many days you plan on being on campus by $6. If it's more than $161.88, buy the summer parking pass. If it's not, buy daily passes. Also, since we're already in July, the pass may already be prorated. Contact parking services and ask what their current price is.\n\nParking fees: http://www.csuci.edu/publicsafety/parking/Parking_Fee.htm\n\n------\n\nFun fact about CI &amp; parking - people like to complain about it, but it isn't even remotely close to how bad nearly every other CSU campus has it. In 2010-11, CI had enough parking places for up to 63% of its students to be on campus at one time. That same year, all other CSU campuses only had parking for (on average) 38% of their students at one time (usually in lots further away than the farthest one at CI). While CI has gained both parking lots and students since that time, the argument is likely still valid.\n\nAlso, related - the reason for such high parking prices is that the CSU system requires each campus' police &amp; public safety departments to be self-sustaining (i.e., they have to fund themselves with parking permit sales and other activities unrelated to existing state funding and student fees).\n\nSources: \n\n1. http://www.csuci.edu/ci-2025/documents/csuci-mp-tocsuci-v1.pdf\n2. Countless campus committee meetings from 2011-13.\n\nMore info on CI 2025: http://www.csuci.edu/ci-2025/\n",

It's expensive with or without the semester pass, and the next-best thing is to use the bus at the Amtrac station that /u/DefunkensteinPhD mentioned because there really aren't any free parking spots that are close to, but off-campus.\n\nThe side streets in UGlen might work, though, but you may or may not get ticketed. Not sure to be honest what will happen.",

            "comment": "Not a graduate student but I think housing options for graduate students is in town centre and Anacapa. I stayed in TC for my last year of undergrad and loved it, but I had a studio that I didn't share. Anacapa apartments suck since theres no a/c and I had to share a small room with another person since housing was limited, and I didn't stay in the other two dorm buildings. \n\nOf course this was a couple of years ago, and I'm not sure how things have changed since they opened up the new freshman dorms. TC had all the good food options, and while it was a slightly further walk to some classes it was just allnover more comfortable. Definitely reach out to the housing office and see if you can get someone from housing to answer some of your questions on how the housing lottery is run now. When I was a student, I was forced into my double occupancy in Anacapa because of when I applied to housing, and only managed to get my single studio in TC because I was upper-classman and I had faster reflexes than other students (everyone was given access to choose their rooms all at once online and if you chose a room that someone else nabbed you had to go bacj and choose another but they were highly competitive so you had to be quick. All of the single rooms had been selected within 3 minutes of the selections opening.",

I had a friend who was a graduate student that was forced into the sophmore dorms (formerly were the freshman dorms before they build the new ones) when he first came to the school because of limited space. But now that they have the freshman dorms, I think its taken off a lot of pressure and has allowed TC to cater more to only seniors/graduate students. \n\nI did a contract with TC for only one semester since I was graduating in the Fall semester, so its definitely possible to only have a contract for one semester, but I'm not sure if they place any requirements on it. \n\nOne thing to note is that TC is definitely more of an apartment complex vibe then it is a dorm, so if you want the full dorm experience I would recommend Anacapa but you WILL be surrounded by younger loud kids and as I mentioned before you don't have a/c. CI is a really great school and I loved it, but its definitely not a party school, and a surprising amount of students are commuters, and the rest that stay on campus don't really participate in a lot of school-sponsored activities (which are actually tons of fun.)",

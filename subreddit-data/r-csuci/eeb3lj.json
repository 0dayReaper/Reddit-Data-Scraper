Is it fun to be there to let of off some steam when needed? Or do you have to go somewhere to party/ enjoy your time. Also are fraternities a good or bad thing there?",

Try and make friends with a bunch of people with your same major as you\u2019ll be seeing them a lot over the next few years. CI has only one recognized  frat and I think another one or two that aren\u2019t recognized by the school.",

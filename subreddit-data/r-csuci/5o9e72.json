    "postText": "After alleviating all of whims and woes on Tumblr, I figured it was about time to join Reddit so here I am! I was accepted into CSUCI for fall 17 as a freshman as an environmental science major back in mid November but I'm not so sure about the school. I'm on the fence for getting into Cal Poly and UCSB and if I didn't get in to either of those I don't think I would feel like I was falling back onto CI because I do actually like the school a lot. One of the biggest things for me though is that it seems to be socially dead. I'm not an incredibly outward person, but I do like to be social to a certain extent if that makes any sense? I like that the school is smaller and all but is it too small? I know \"it's what you make of it\" but as much as you put into a school there are certain limits to what they offer. \n\n\nI guess in this lengthy and uniforming post I just want to know what you like or don't like about the school. Do most people live off campus after sophomore year? What is there to do around the school? *I'm from Northern California and I've only been to Socal three times so excuse my ignorance of the area\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I've lived in the dorms for a year and a half. I graduated in December after transferring in. I'm a pretty secluded and private person, and don't really go out of my way to make plans very often, and even then I ended up meeting some great people and had plenty of opportunities to do stuff. \n\nSince you're coming from SoCal I'm assuming that you're staying in the dorms and thats a really good thing. Its a commuter school definitely, but there are so many chances for socialization in the dorms. A lot of students are also transfers, so a lot of students living on campus are actually sophomores and seniors as well. The dorm you'll be living in is Freshman only, then if you stay on campus you'll be living in the Sophomore dorms for 2nd year. Usually students who live on campus from Freshman year typically find an off campus apt for Junior/Senior year because its expensive to live on campus and they have bad experiences because the school had a million people cramped into one apartment before the Freshman dorms were built. \n\nI absolutely love CI. There are definitely a lot of things that it can be doing more efficiently to help build a closer community, but its definitely one of those schools that like you said, you need to put something in to get something back. Joining a club is a must to find people with similar interests as you since you'll only have your roommate that you'll know for a while until you start making friends from class/in the dorms. I went to several clubs' meetings and made some amazing definitely lifelong friends. \n\nThere are parties almost every weekend on campus, and you will be able to find kickbacks everyday somewhere in the dorms. Just meet people, and because its a pretty small school just ask around if there are any parties going on to friends/acquaintances or just follow the sounds of loud music. \n\nIf you prefer more laidback kick backs without drinking (If you plan to drink, always plan a way out because the RA's will come out of nowhere from noise complaints, and EVERYONE will get in trouble. That said, if there is a medical emergency and alcohol/drugs were used please don't hesitate to call 911 since you will basically have amnesty from getting in trouble. We don't want anyone to die.) there are lots of more nerdier people who enjoy game nights, watching movies, playing sports, bible studies, etc. \n\nEveryone is always down for donuts, and the best spot in town is the rolling pin. Open almost 24 hours (usually close in the middle of the day to restock), its a good bonding outing for friends/roommates and pretty cheap if you split a dozen or half dozen. \n\nThe public transit is pretty weak, but they do have a free trolley that takes you to basically any kind of shopping you would need to do. (Grocery, target, mall) The VISTA bus also takes you to other areas such as the Thousand Oaks Mall, Oxnard, Ventura, etc. The cost of a bus pass is $25/semester, and its definitely necessary if you don't have a car. The school has a zipcar if you have a drivers license or you can grab an Uber if you need to get somewhere that isnt easily accessable. I would recommend getting a bike to get around town from the Metro/bus station. I used to walk approximately 5-10 miles one way  around town to get to appointments because I was too cheap to pay for an Uber. The city also has a bus alternative thats i think $2.50/one way but you have to arrange for that to pick you up, and it doesnt pick up at the school. \n\nThis is getting long so I'll get back and tie it back to the main point, and that is: I love CI, but there are also many students who are very vocal about their discontent because its not a party school at all. The parties are not the tv typical college frat parties, and are more laid back kickbacks than parties. The scenery around the school is absolutely gorgeous, and the beach is less than a 10 minute drive from the school. The air smells like strawberries or cilantro some mornings, and 95% of the school population are extremely nice. Holding doors open for each other is basically law, and if you don't hold open the doors we can basically figure out who is new to the school among other nuances. \n\nDefinitely join a club, get to meet people on your floor, go to the floor meetings/events because they should have fun activities for you to get to know the people on your floor plus usually there is free food. Work hard on your studies rather than prioritizing parties (which is what most students who grumble don't do), because CI is a small school, and most likely you'll have some of the same teachers a couple of times during your CI career, and the harder you work, the more likely they are to recommend opportunities to you. Most of the professors are absolutely amazing and have TONS of real world experience. \n\nHope this helps! And remember, I can really only give you my perspective which will obviously be biased based on my own personal experiences, but if you go into any school without any preconceived notions or expectations its hard to be disappointed. So make any school you decide to go to, one that you're proud to be at. Work hard during the week, and relax a bit on the weekend. \n\nIf you have any other questions let me know!\n\n",

Commuting 30 minutes isn't too bad, but still. I want to experience living at the dorms, even if it's just for one year.\n\nHow's the experience at the dorms? I know the social life on campus isn't crazy out there, but I would assume its enough for someone who wants to make friends and good relationships.",

                            "comment": "I always want to encourage every college student to dorm their first year of college IF they have the funds to so. It's such a unique experience and imo you miss out on so many learning experiences that you don't quite get just staying at home with your parents and commuting. \n\nSo I would say its definitely worth it (the new freshman dorms are pretty cool, except they have communal bathrooms which is a bit of a bummer but not too big of a deal unless you're shy), as long as you have the extra cash to pay for it and it wont put you in a bad situation. \n\nThe social life on campus is good, but you have to really put yourself out there to get the best out of it. A lot of people will complain that they can't make friends on campus (even if they're dorming) but most of them don't even try. Even if you don't end up living on campus, you can follow the same idea and put yourself out there and before you know it you'll end up with a ton of friends. Join multiple clubs, either for things that you're interested in, or join a random club and learn something new (and maybe a new passion? at the very least it will mean new friends since you can ask questions about the topic within the club to start getting friends :)) \n\nThe campus overall is more geared towards older students IMO, as its much more quiet then you would expect a university to be (I mean, it IS nestled in the hills!), but it was hands down an absolutely excellent experience for me. I joined a club and ended up club vice president, and made a ton of friends along the way. I would have liked to join more clubs but because I took on a lot of work for that one club alone I didn't have the time (along with taking over 16 units each semester). \n\nBack on topic though, if you do dorm, expect to be placed in a double (meaning you will share a small-ish room with one other person) 100% unless you have a medical condition that requires you to have a single. Your roommate may end up being the worst thing to happen to you, but it gives you a ton of perspective on your own habits. Or you could end up with a perfectly normal person with similar habits as you (you will fill out a survey when filling out the housing application so they try to match you with roommates with similar habits as you such as bedtime, wake time, study habits, etc.) and you may even end up becoming best friends with your roommate (since they are afterall your first friend if you do decide to move into the dorms.) If you have any other questions let me know! I think the school does housing tours everyday if you wanted to check them out before taking the leap, otherwise see if you can get into contact with some students already currently dorming in the freshman dorms who would be willing to let you check out their room for a realistic setting!",

I like the small size of the school and its proximity to La without it actually being in la itself. For me, unless I miraculously get into Cal Poly or Santa Barbara csu's are my only option and they're more affordable for my family. The only csus I applied to were channel islands, sonoma, and cal poly and since I want to go to la I'll probably go to CI. I want to major in environmental science and the school has a good little program for it based on what I've read and has access to the actual channel islands for research. I know the school is a bit in the middle of nowhere but if I'll be living off campus half of the time it doesn't really matter to me because I can drive a bit to amazing places. I find the history of the school's origin fascinating and love the Spanish style of the buildings. Where else did you apply to and what did you want to major in? ",

            "comment": "Hey! Congrats on your acceptance. CI is a pretty awesome school. Last semester was my first semester on campus. I was accepted in fall of 2020. The students are nice, and so are the professors. Even online, I\u2019ve had great experiences. I enjoyed the in-person classroom experience a lot. The campus is beautiful, and like I said, nice folks all around. The food is good. I never went to like the CI food cafeteria or anything, but there are shops and restaurants behind the library over by the bookstore. They\u2019re super nice. The Mexican restaurant is quite good. There is even a bar. Though, you just graduated high school, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll only visit that in a few years ;) \nI do recommend the school. They have very active clubs, and even events. Not sure if you live in the area, but the surrounding area is beautiful. As for the dorms, I never stayed in them, but I did tour them. Wow, they\u2019re small. Like real small. Plus, you share them. But hey, that\u2019s part of the college experience, right? haha\nI commuted, and it was still worth it for me. \nGood luck on your future endeavors!",

            "comment": "Late to the party but 4th year student here. We get campus life questions every few weeks, so feel free to look at my profile for info regarding that. its kind a strange that nobody answered your question.\n\nLemme give you a break down of what food, class experience, and dorms. \n\n-Food: this and last semester has seen the downfall of one of the best parts of campus, the cafeteria (we call it the Caf). due to the reduced campus capacity it wont be hard finding a seat.  AFAIK we still have limited dining option, with a rotating menu each day, and a few evergreen menus like fastfood, salads, made to order pizza, and made to order sandwhiches. The food is typically mediocre, an A+ for the Caf is an B every where else. There are a few gems in the rotating menu, but you gotta hunt for them.\n\nWhat made the caf great in the before times was the shared community and the options for food, and both of those have been slashed in half.\n\n-food (2): There are resturaunts on campus, most of them are fantastic. We have a starbucks next to the library, an amazing Mexican food place, equally good Chinese takeout, an ok fast food joint, ok coffee shop, and a meh pizza place. the student union has the coffee shop and fast food. A great spot for a study session its normally packed so the ambience is fun. If you dorm, you get prepaid currency to buy things in these resturuants. \n\n-Dorms: Freshies get the classic dormitory feel, you share a room with 1 other person with a floor of 30 other people. The dorms are coed, our schools population is majority female, so expect majority female in your dorm life. I made all the friends I have currently in the freshman dorms. keep your door open when you're not busy for free entertainment and meeting new people. If you put in some effort to making friends here, you'll survive. \n\nWhen it comes to the... illicit activities, they are policed against moderately. Weed is against policy and alcohol is permitted only for people who pass a seminar on it and are 21+. However, that doesn't mean that nobody does those things, just dont be stupid about it.\n\nClass experience: classrooms are typically 30-40 people. The profs. here are pretty good in my opinion. They are excited about teaching, asking for help is just an email away. nothing notable comes to mind about classes, feel free to ask if you wanted anything specific. \n\nAgain if you have any questions feel free to look through my profile for answers, or reply to this comment.",

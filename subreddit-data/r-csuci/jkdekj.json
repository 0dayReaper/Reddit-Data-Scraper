            "comment": "AWFUL. She only makes PR statements all the time because our student body calls her out on her lack of leadership all the time. From the few years I've spent at CSUCI, she's been very criticized by our student body for her lack of action when we had a gun incident on Halloween a few years ago (basically told kids to go home and most of us didn't even get a notification that school was cancelled except from our professors via canvas). Then we had the fires following that and they didn't evacuate us immediately when the fires started behind campus. \n\nCSUCI is a small school so word travels. I've heard some sus stuff and not so nice stuff from my professors about her. Our school is well known for our ESRM program, I remember seeing this notorious headline and also posted repeatedly by one of the school's ESRM clubs about how her President's Dinner left a bunch of trash in one of our quads and they cleaned it up for her and posted all about it on social media. I've seen MULTIPLE clubs publicly callout her for her not really giving a fuck and she always replies with some PR apology every time. The Shades of CI instagram has some tea-worthy posts about how the school's money funds her personal expenses and how the school has been money laundering etc. I will warn you there is some TW stuff on the page. She also deleted her Instagram because she was criticized for her response to the Instagram page. So I'm not surprised she's leaving CSUCI at all. \n\n[http://civiewnews.com/news/appalled-students-clean-up-after-presidents-dinner-attendees/](http://civiewnews.com/news/appalled-students-clean-up-after-presidents-dinner-attendees/)\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/shadesofcsuci/](https://www.instagram.com/shadesofcsuci/)",

Upload vids supporting the universities' policies in times of crisis (rn) and send emails about current events. I have no clue about her administrative decisions though.",

But otherwise yeah, she seemed to be pretty involved with the community and posted videos frequently about school activities and whatnot. I never met her personally though.",

She is not going to make a decision she will always look to her peers to pull the trigger unless it\u2019s time sensitive (which always enraged the students and that\u2019s understandable). When she comes in with her cabinet she will be organized and very strict with her time. I will say she did take the time to know my name and ask how I\u2019m doing often. She will emphasize academic achievements from research by having them present at major donor dinners or \u201csocials\u201d unfortunately the different departments presenting wouldn\u2019t see a dime.",

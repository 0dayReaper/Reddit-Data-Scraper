There aren\u2019t any tracks yet, which kind of sucks, but it\u2019s not bad. The professors are nice, and I\u2019m going to say that it\u2019s been pretty easy throughout. I\u2019m not sure If chose it again though, as it doesn\u2019t have any tracks, no one I\u2019ve mentioned the school to know it exists, and I feel like I haven\u2019t learned anything specific or applicable to the health field (except medical terminology). But as the user below mentioned, there are several clubs and you could find a way to get a little more involved like in research with professor Linton and work as a wellness peer advocate at the health center.",

They do teach a lot of public health basics, and I feel like I\u2019ve heard that they\u2019re trying to establish a public health track in the future, and a lot of the professors have an MPH. You\u2019ll probably have to go on to get a MPH yourself, but this wouldn\u2019t be a bad place to start. But CI doesn\u2019t really have a college presence or anything, it\u2019s really small and there\u2019s not much going on. As for internships, I can\u2019t say. I transferred in last Spring before Covid hit and I feel like internships got put on hold.",

I've taken the Network Security class, and a few other IT classes that are cross listed between CS and I.T. The minor is relatively new, so not a lot of people have experience with it.\n\nTruthfully, I wouldn't describe the I.T. curriculum as particularly rigorous, especially compared to my CS classes, but I've found it varies wildly by teacher. I've had friends take classes the semester after me with a different professor and our experiences are completely different. For what it's worth, the newer professors are definitely bringing in a more comprehensive curriculum and there are definitely some fantastic professors. \n\nIf you want a job in computer security, I would recommend majoring in CS and focusing on security courses rather than majoring in I.T.  You can take the I.T. courses that would be relevant to you, like Security and maybe Unix programming as electives, but instead of taking things like \"Data Structures for I.T. Majors\" you'll just take straight up \"Data Structures\". I think you'll come out of it with a much broader skill set, and a lot more math knowledge. As an I.T. major you're not even required to take Linear Algebra which is huge for Cryptography. You'll also miss out on classes like Automata and Algorithms which are (currently) taught with a strong focus on security/encryption. Plus the degree pays more, and you'll have an easier time finding internships.\n\n",

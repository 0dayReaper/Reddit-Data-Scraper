Also, if you can view your direct deposit form, double check the account number and routing number on it. Basically, double check everything on your end.\n\nIf you don't get your money by tomorrow or so, contact financial aid (sometimes banks/credit unions delay deposits by a day or so). If you walk in, bring your student ID. Be prepared to tell them where your expected funds came from (e.g., loans, grants, scholarships, etc.) and tell them that you haven't received your direct deposit.\n\nBest of luck!",

If not, that could be the reason you have not received a disbursement.\n\nRegarding tuition &amp; housing payment info, check your myCI account -- you should be able to view your account balance and if/when CI received payment from student loans/grants/etc.",

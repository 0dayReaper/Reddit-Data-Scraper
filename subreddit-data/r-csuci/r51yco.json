The Collection is a pretty short drive from Ventura, pretty good food and probably has the most going on in Oxnard.\n\nCampus itself is unfortunately in the middle of a whole lot of nothing so it's a bit of a drive to get anywhere, closest drive would be to the Cam outlets/surrounding area where there are some good options like the previous person mentioned. \n\nA side note for on-campus food, I haven't been on campus in a while due to covid/not having taken classes this sem, but campus options (the cafe, the restaurants in the plaza, the cafeteria)are alright, certainly not incredible. I did eat the cafe's chili cheese fries at least 2x a week though lol.",

For Thai the best in Ventura is Rice by Mama!!! In Camarillo you have try donuts from Rolling Pin (they\u2019re open in the evening).",

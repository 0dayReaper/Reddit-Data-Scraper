Do you desperately wish you were involved on campus or have more friends with the same interests as you? Well good news there is the Channel Islands Artist Club on campus! It's going to be a really amazing year. Some pretty radical events are in the works and we hope to have the Show III, the third installment of our off-campus, student organized show. Please feel free to PM me if you have any questions. you can sign up here! &gt;&gt;&gt;https://orgsync.com/login/california-state-university-channel-islands&lt;&lt;&lt;",

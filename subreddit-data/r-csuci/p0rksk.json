    "postText": "Hey! Im currently an incoming sophomore and I move in within the next couple of weeks. I've spent the past year online due to Covid-19 at CI, so this is practically my freshman year and an entirely new experience that I'm both excited and scared to have. One of the reasons i'm concerned is the lack of information about CI that's not directly from the school, (ie: student vlogs, social media etc), and especially lack of information about the social environment at CI. What is it like on campus, especially on the weekends? I've read on here that it can be pretty dead, which really bums me out. How are the parties if there are any? I understand CI isn't a party school, but I am trying to have a lot of fun at college. I probably am coming off as some sort of wanna be frat jerk, but a lot of my friends who moved away came back over summer with plenty of stories and things to show me about their social lives, and Im just worried I might miss out on that kind of college experience here at CI.",

That said, I'm told the dorms can get crazy. The people can be very friendly, I've made friends without even trying",

            "comment": "I graduated ~2 years ago so for all I know everything has changed but this is what I recall:\n\nThe school is mostly commuters and people just trying to get an affordable degree, many of whom aren't trying to party. \nThe campus is very self-isolated so unless you have a car and want to drive to LA/Ventura/SB the night life scene is not much of an option. \nWeekends are dead including Friday since most people don't have Friday classes. I specifically remember standing in the center of campus at 6pm on a Thursday and not seeing anybody cause they've all dipped out by then. Even for those living in the dorms, a lot of them like to go home on the weekends. It's a self fulfilling prophecy: nothing happens on campus on the weekends so people leave, but since people leave nothing ever happens on campus.\n\nSo that's the worst of it. That being said there are parties and opportunities to be outgoing. I would say the social scene in general is more quality than quantity. You won't make 100 friends but you'll have several close-knit friend circles. The parties won't be crowds of randoms doing keg-stands and burning couches, but they'll be lively hangouts with people who mostly all know each other. \n\nThose that live in the dorms are usually friendlier and more social because the boredom makes you either wanna develop an alcohol addiction alone or reach out for friendship. Anacapa and Town Center are the only dorm villages where any decent party can logistically happen, although Santa Cruz can have an intimate kickback too. That being said, RA's can shutdown a loud party pretty easily. Off-campus house parties are the better option, but you usually have to know someone.\n\nYou definitely sound like someone who should join a frat (there were 1.5 when I left, one was not recognized the the university). And I think just engaging with people in the dorms and your classes can get you very far. There is no elitist mentality at CI because they all go to a sad state school so everyone is pretty down to earth and approachable. Make a point to not rot inside your dorm room. Do your homework on the quad, eat at the dining hall, chill at the library. Always put yourself in a position where you can meet people. \n\nMost importantly, make sure you actually finish school (I swear half the people didn't graduate in 4 year if they graduated at all). I know it's cliche to say \"college is what you make of it\" but that's especially true at CI because it's so easy to just passively exist there instead of participating. You get what you give.\n\nLastly, keep in mind that the fun times don't start and end with college. You'll have plenty of fun after college too, except you'll actually have money this time.",

            "comment": "Incoming Senior here. You are not alone in your feelings, this question is asked at least once a month so don't worry about how you are being perceived. Your assumptions are correct that this isnt a party school, and a lot of folks go home for the weekends. I wrote another comment on how the social scene is in general, so feel free to click my profile for more info. Specifically on the weekends here's how you get by here.\n\n\nClubs: this is the strongest part of CI. Join a couple clubs to see what fits, and you basically already have a crew for the weekends.\n\nFind a link for the off campus parties: Im not a party person, but I hear they are not too bad. I'd steer clear cause of everything going on right now. Also, these parties are a little sketchy. I've heard my fair share of party horror stories so be careful. \n\nMost of the on-campus kickbacks are for close knit friends, so they are pretty exclusive. Its also against school policy for oncampus drinking unless you get your permit. \n\nHonestly, the way I survived is to find a crew or two to spend time with. See who is staying for the weekend, and just hang out with them.",

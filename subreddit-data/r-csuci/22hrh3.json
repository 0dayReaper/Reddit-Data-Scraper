I won't repeat that but.  To summarize,\n\n+ Check out the gym.\n+ Talk to students at your major's table, professors too if they are there.\n+ Go for a walk/drive/hike around campus to get a feel for the place.\n+ Check out Uglen.\n+ Ask counselors about classes for GE requirements.  (They sometime know the details of your major classes but they don't always have all the details.)\n+ Ask professors or students in your major about classes in your major. \n\nIt's going to be kinda dead on Saturday except for Discover CI.  The campus is a lot busier during the week when classes are going on.  So keep that in mind.",

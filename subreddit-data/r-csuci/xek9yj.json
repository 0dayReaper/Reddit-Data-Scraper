    "postText": "Hi, guys!! I know the struggle of being a student and having the pressure to constantly find ways to improve our resumes so we can be the perfect candidate. There is an online resource that is made for college students in order to help us find multiple job/internship opportunities. It's called Ripplematch and it creates a feed based on your interests and skills so you can find multiple opportunities that are curated just for you. I know this sounds very ad-like but I\u2019ve struggled a lot with finding the right opportunities to help prepare me for my future career and Ripplematch has saved me so much time with that search. I\u2019ll leave a link to create a profile :) Also, summer 2023 internships are opening up so I definitely recommend to start applying soon!\n\n[https://ripplematch.com/index?r=qv36v5](https://ripplematch.com/index?r=qv36v5)",

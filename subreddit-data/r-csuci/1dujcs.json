Other than that I've lived in town the past couple years so I don't really follow what events happen on campus anymore.\n\nDon't: Spend too much time on campus, it can get pretty damn depressing. Speed. Get parking tickets. ",

In Camarillo you can go to Brendan's for some night life but the clubhouse and chuy's are pretty fun too. The clubhouse has free pool on Tuesday nights and I usually run into some people there.\nWhen cam isn't cuttin for you there is always downtown Ventura. This place has a really fun night life, live music, many good bars, and lots of good people. I suggest first Fridays too, every first Friday of the month there are open art galleries that usually have booze and music. Even the pier has a bar on it. \nCamarillo is as boring as you make it, with Ventura and the beach right around the corner you can be as active as you want. \nI just landed a job as a bartender at the blu orkid in Ventura so if you are ever around in the morning or afternoon stop by for some food or a drink or two. Good luck!",

Pretty damn good school (at least for English) for being so new and in a bedroom community of LA.\n\n2. Waaaaay too many cops for this town. It has more than Cal Poly SLO and THAT school actually needed a police force.\n\n3. Camarillo is the most \"un-college town\" college town you will ever see. Give it another 10-15 years and the students might take over but until then prepare to be bombarded with good old fashioned wholesome family values. \n\n4. Do you like bars? Shit outta luck. There's ONE bar to go to called Brendan's. The others are great if you like talking to 40-something year-olds who like it quieter and can afford overpriced drinks.\n\n5. The malls are okay. I like the Vans outlet because i can save 4 to 5 dollars on a pair of kicks.\n\n6. Do me a favor and start some clubs at CSUCI. I would have started an Agnostic/Atheist club if I had more time (not that you have to do that one).\n\n7. I've lived in San Diego, Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, and have spent a fair amount of time in San Francisco. CSUCI is a great school, but having graduated I cannot wait to get the F#$K out of here. WAAAAY too sleepy. Cheers!  \n\n    ",

My biggest values are a college where people are nice, there's good student life, a lot of people living in the dorms, good classes, and a good study abroad program!",

But the student life and dorms were 10x more alive before covid rather than now. I hope it changes over the course of time but idk how it\u2019ll be for the fall semester",

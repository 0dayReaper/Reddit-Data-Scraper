There are tons of people and clubs riding there so you could talk to them or find a local cycling club.  I live about 9 miles from PCH and I love riding there from school you are like 4-5 miles.\n\nEDIT:  If you like hills you have great access to Portrero Rd which goes up to Dos Vientos (back side of newbury park) and you can take Lynn rd all the way to TO / Close to Westlake area.",

I've been in 40+ person classes that were super chill with fun professors, and classes that started with 14 and ended with 7 that were really intense. If your major has a club, you can ask the upperclassmen there about specific classes/teachers/professors",

The only class I can remember bigger than that was the History &amp; Psychology of Nazi Germany which is in the auditorium and usually enrolls 60-75 students. \n\nI found most history professors to have three or four office hours a week, and they are very helpful to help you find additional sources or literature. Psychology professors here are also very pleasant, some of them have worked as clinicians or childhood psychologists in the past, so they have relevant experience.",

A lot of them are hybrid history/psych so you can even get a history minor at the end. Also his classes are easy (drop weakest test, 10% grade on final paper of a biography of your choosing). He worked in a mental institution (at least one)\n\nI am trying to remember the other professors names. Dr. Oca's class can be very difficult (neuroscience and other perceptual classes) but I recommend taking her class instead of neuroscience in the biology department.",

I know every graduate gets two parking passes, but we won't have one. Where should we park and how far is the walk to the event? TIA!\n\n(Congrats, Graduates! What a difficult four years it's been with wildfire evacuations, a global pandemic, and remote learning...but you did it!)",

Shuttles will not be available at Commencement. Guests are also encouraged to utilize the city buses for transportation from the Camarillo Metrolink Station to campus.\n\nThe campus will open two hours prior to each ceremony. Graduates and guests will enter on University Drive and must have their University-issued Commencement Parking Permits visible as they arrive. Only those vehicles with a University-issued Commencement Parking Permit will be allowed to park on campus. Student parking permits, student housing parking permits, day permits, and other regularly issued University parking permits are not valid for Commencement. Event staff will direct traffic once on campus, please follow directions to the appropriate parking lot.",

There is no unpermitted parking on campus or in any of the residential areas around campus.\n\nThere is a bus that runs from Camarillo Metrolink/Amtrak station directly to campus every 1.5 hours or so.  Parking at the station is free.\n\nSorry I don't know anymore specifics.",

Without a parking permit you will likely need to take the shuttle transportation. Farm workers do park off road in wider dirt areas, but there is no guarantee there will be spaces, plus technically most of those areas are on private property.  Maybe consult with your graduate and see if one of the permitted cars can do a shuttle run, dropping a group off, and then parking?\n\nYou might want to call Parking Services and ask their advice.",

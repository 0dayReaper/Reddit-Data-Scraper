    "postText": "Hi everyone! I am a current CSUCI Student taking an Intro to Comm Research class. For my research topic, I am hosting an anonymous survey that revolves around how social media and technology affect consumerism. If any of yall have the extra time to waste I would love the participation and extra data, It is 23 questions long and takes around 3-4 minutes to complete on average so far. Here is the link:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMZwghxEroNlAM9c6lVngfHhuFORsQqWdFUV8rjoV\\_bTPWBA/viewform?usp=sf\\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMZwghxEroNlAM9c6lVngfHhuFORsQqWdFUV8rjoV_bTPWBA/viewform?usp=sf_link)  \n\nThank you all :)",

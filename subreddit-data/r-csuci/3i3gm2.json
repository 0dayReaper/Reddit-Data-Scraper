Oh well. :) I need to really pick up a fan for my bunk though because its too hot without one that I'm struggling to sleep a little. I haven't gone to the caf yet though. Just been eating whatever I have here in my door that I brought and the free food they had today at the club thing and the basketball event. My roommates/suitemates are awesome, our last roommate moved in today. I'm excited for classes to start tomorrow. ",

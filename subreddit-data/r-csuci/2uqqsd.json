I'm no social butterfly by any means, but it's kind of off-putting after living on campus awhile. \n\nIs there something in the water?\n\nAlso, like 95% of the people who go here are from either Oxnard or Ventura. I'll never understand people who live on campus that close to their home, venture out further!\n\n/rant",

I mostly only socialize with those within my major because of those similar interests that make it easier to carry on a conversation.  And I didn't venture out because I didn't want any tremendous debts of living far away (I'm not down for loans) because if I had the means I would definitely go elsewhere for the experience. I travel/work on the weekends frequently as well so when I'm at school I make sure to get most of my work done then and there so I can have that weekend to enjoy my trips. \n\n\n\n",

    "postText": "Hello everyone! I am a transfer student from Los Angeles Valley College, and I have been admitted to a California State University for the major of **Business with the option of Finance**. Therefore, I would like to ask you, Business majors from CSUCI the following questions.\n\n1. Are you a Business student at CSUCI?\n\n2. Would you recommend the program?\n\n3. Does CSUCI offer opportunities for Business majors, such as internships, job fairs, interviews, and other opportunities that allow Business students to succeed?\n\n4. If you have graduated, or you know someone who graduated from CSUCI with a business degree, how difficult was it to find employment?\n\n5. How much could one expect to earn with a Business degree from CSUCI?\n\nI also would like to add, that if I go to Cal State Channel Islands, I will be getting a minor in computer science, and I will also be obtaining an associates in economics at my community college. \n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "1. No, but two of my roommates last year were business majors. \n\n2. Based on the vicarious experiences I've had living through business with my roommates, I would say yes. It seems like the program is difficult, but ultimately its very rewarding. \n\n3. CI has SO many opportunities for internship, job fairs, and networking. Many local businesses typically end up hiring students from CI because of the excellent relationship the school has built and many alumni rise in their ranks and hire other alumni/students. Use of the support services such as the career center is also a huge bonus. They are AMAZING! \n\n4. See answer in #3 above. \n\n5. Since the world of business is vast, you'll get the best answer by searching on google what average starting salary/income is for the exact field/position you'd like to enter.\n\nAs for your last statement, the business program is somewhat difficult, and so I'm apprehensive about encouraging you to take on 3 different educational goals at one time. The computer science courses here are extremely time consuming, couple that with the business classes and your want for another associates, and you may end up finding yourself in trouble with too much to do and not enough time to properly dedicate yourself to something. Is CS something you enjoy personally, or do you believe this will help you raise your worth when it comes to hiring?\n\nInstead of going straight into a minor in CS, I would suggest you take the intro class to scope it out and see how you can handle the load. I would say, maximum you want to focus on is two at a time. So choose either the associates, or the minor. When you finish one, then you can decide if the other is still something you would like to achieve.\n\nI think a lot of business students get minors in math or economics ( I can't remember which, or maybe its a different minor) because they only require one or two classes extra since most of the business classes will double count. \n\nIn some ways the school definitely feels similar to a community college, but the work load is not one of them. It would be best not to stress yourself out too hard since you'll get burnt out quick and ultimately grades will suffer. Just take that into consideration when you ultimately decide what you'd like to do. \n\nIf you have any questions don't hesitate to ask! I'd be happy to hopefully give you a solid answer. Good luck! (P.s. I was also a transfer from a San Diego CC.)",

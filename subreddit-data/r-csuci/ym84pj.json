I\u2019m a business major too but I plan on going to law school after I graduate and she connected me with a lawyer to mentor me in the process. She also helps students find jobs and helps them prepare for the application and interview process.",

Career fairs are also hosted every semester. Most of my business professors had interesting backgrounds with start ups, consulting, non profits (get to know them).",

I definitely put in work to be a good lab partner just in case I got stuck with a lame one. \n\nI noticed that the people with lab partners frequently had bad data and ended up using my data a few times at the direction of our professor. They also ended up having to repeat a lot of experiments lol.",

There\u2019s extra credit for the lecture class so don\u2019t worry about that grade too much. The professor wants everyone to succeed with happy grades. If you have a fair understanding of statistics that will help a lot for lecture. We definitely got interrupted in our classes by all the drama last semester with campus closures and such, it totally worked out in the students favor causing us to have to skip a lab experiment which was sooo awesome.\n\nWe never used the textbook in lecture, however I found it useful when doing some of the lab reports, especially the one that uses matrices (all the instructions for setting up the matrices are in the textbook step-by-step). The lab reports are in excel, and it is very time consuming if you are not familiar with doing lab reports in excel. The lab was more difficult than the lectures. I highly recommend going to office hours once a week to see your lab professor and go over your report before you turn it in. \n\nMy professors were Melanie Pribisko and Halim Ugandabaya (I think that\u2019s how its spelled) everyone just calls him Halim. Both of these professors were awesome! I really enjoyed their courses and their method of instruction. I would totally take another class taught be either of them.",

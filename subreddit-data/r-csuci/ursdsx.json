            "comment": "Hi there, Sociology major here.\n\nMy experience with the sociology department is very good so far, because the professors clearly love their jobs. While there was another comment here regarding a few bad profs, I think that person was unlucky. I've been in the program for 4ish years now and all of the profs were accomodating and inspiring before, during, and after covid. I can DM you some of the good professors if you want them. Imho, if you show that you are excited about something, the professors will genuinely take you under their wing to guide you. \n\nif you want to get the most out of sociology at CI, use Summer SURF which is the summer undergrad research program. I wasn't lucky enough but you can use it to get ahead in field research before you graduate. \n\nA very good point in sociology at CI is how close it is to actual sociological hotspots. Suburban life is difficult to explore from a city, we are nearby (maybe) undocumented farm workers because of the farmland nearby, we are also very close to an aging population that can be explored too. I was lucky enough to get ethnographies of suburban teenage deviancy here. You get to have hands on experience with populations that aren't easily reachable when you are out here.\n\nWhen it comes to after the degree, I agree that it is important to know what to do after. Sociology can be applied to a set of vastly different fields. Find a niche to fill and run with it. You'd be surpised how applicable your research, writing, and an understanding of soc is. I reccomend taking SOC-489 Careers in Sociology if you are a little lost. It goes over how to apply your soc background in the real world.",

            "comment": "Current Sociology major here, my experience has been awful so far. I've only had two professors, but they were horrible.\n\nFirst professor changed the class to online at the beginning of the year, which I can understand. Covid and all that. But then he made it completely asynchronous, with the occasional video recording of him talking about a subject without really saying much of substance. Our final for that class was to watch a lecture from ANOTHER professor from a different university on a subject we had never heard of before, then write a paragraph response on what we thought. I legitimately believe he just wanted something easy to grade.\n\nMy second professor has legitimately made me consider dropping out of CSUCI. He would never answer emails or messages on Canvas, would cancel classes as close as 10 minutes before we were supposed to start (mind you, many people commute to this campus, so they just wasted an hour of their life) and was just bad at lecturing. The classes were lifeless and awkward, and I really gained nothing from them, despite the fact that they were all mandatory. \n\nMaybe I could have forgiven all that. But when my brother died earlier this year, he STILL ignored me, never sent me a single message while I was trying to work out SOMETHING with him so that I could pass. It got so bad that I had to get my roommate's boss to contact the head of the department to tell him to respond to me a WEEK BEFORE FINALS. He then gives me two days to make up a month and a half of missing work, but then forgets to unlock all of the assignments for me and has still yet to change my absences to excused absences.\n\nPerhaps I've just been incredibly unlucky with my Sociology professors. A lot of the professors here are amazing and wonderful and were really there for me at my lowest point to ensure I graduated. I've also heard really good things about the psychology program and professors in case you want to switch majors. But going off my experiences, I would advise you to stay far away from that program. If you do decide that you'll attend, avoid Gary Garcia with your life.",

I have heard several stories about the department and i\u2019m definitely having second thoughts about it all.. might just end up switching to a communications major. I\u2019m so sorry you had to experience that, I really hope it gets better for you these upcoming semesters. If you don\u2019t mind me asking, are you still declaring sociology as your major?",

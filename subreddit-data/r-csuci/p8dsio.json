    "postText": "I am applying here and several other CSU\u2019s this fall as a transfer student. Channel Islands catches my eyes for a few reasons: near the beach, far from home (I\u2019m from the Bay Area), non impacted campus, near LA and Santa Barbara, good for my major (psychology). One thing that is important is social culture - I\u2019m not against nor think a party culture is important, and I\u2019m ok with a small community as long as I can make friends. Would you say it\u2019s easy to make friends here? What are most the students like?\n\nEdit: if any psychology students have any tips/insight on the psych department here, that would be helpful :-)",

            "comment": "Best way to make friends is to find the most social person you can and make friends with them. Then you\u2019ll have a group of people. Campus is small, but I think that can make it easier to socialize in some ways, you\u2019ll probably see the same students in your major classes over and over.\n\nIf you surf and have a car there are very few better campuses for the money. Campus is VERY chill and secluded. You have to drive pretty far for any city life. LA is quite a ways away and Camarillo is very suburban. Ventura is up an coming but also a bit of a drive. I personally love it but i commute and am not looking for a partying vibe. I just like to go to class chill out on campus, and surf once in while.",

Are you able to take any of your classes there?\n\nAs for that commute from Santa Barbara do you ever take the train? I keep hoping MetroLink would extend service out that far, but I know if you are coming for the day the Amtrak train has morning down and evening return service. Have you ever taken the train ($19 each way) to get in more study time? https://www.pacificsurfliner.com/globalassets/pdfs/schedules/767278330\\_pacific-surfliner-timetable\\_june-28-2021.pdf/",

It is a little harder to make friends later in your college career, since you have to be \"accepted\" into already formed groups of friends. What happens most of the time is that a group of friends form and you stay with 2-3 of those groups until graduation. But here are a couple things you wanna do. \n\nSince you are a transfer, your best bet is to just join a club. We have a great club/special interest community,  and do a club recruitment fair every start of semester. Class sizes are small and even smaller semester due to Covid. So try to make friends in your classes. Also be friends with your roommate, this is the easy way to join a group\n\nOn the topic of what people are like? It depends on where you look. Most people are here for the degree or the price tag so we are pretty serious. I can't make any generalizations beyond that.",

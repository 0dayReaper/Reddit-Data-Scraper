There is nothing to do in Camarillo and it is a bit isolated. Education wise, Csuci was good and I graduated a semester early. But In terms of social life , I probably would\u2019ve enjoyed my time better in Santa Barbara or San Diego.  Csusm is fine, but it\u2019s a commuter school. At both Csuci and csusm , my main intention was to get my degree and move on.",

I am planning on getting a masters and doctorate in occupational therapy so I want a reputable but affordable school to go to and I was accepted to both. I\u2019m leaning more towards San Marcos as it\u2019s also a more affordable place to live. Thank you for your input!!",

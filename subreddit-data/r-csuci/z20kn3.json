    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm a PhD student in political science at the University of Southern California looking to recruit participants for a dissertation study. \n\nI'm hoping to talk to some Ventura County residents about their thoughts on politics today. If you are selected to participate, you will be asked to take part in an in-person focus group discussion for up to 1.5 hours. If you are interested in talking to others about U.S. politics or contributing to a study trying to understand how people feel about partisan politics, this could be a good fit for you!\n\nThese are the basic eligibility requirements:\n\n* You identify as Latino or non-Latino white\n\n* You are 18 years or older\n\n* You are eligible to vote\n\n* You are currently living in Ventura County\n\nEveryone who participates in the focus group discussion will receive a $35 Amazon gift card as a thank you for their time. \n\n[If you're interested in participating and want to see if you qualify, you can fill out the survey at the link here.](https://usc.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_brPWyupP5UcLd42)",

    "postText": "What is Humans vs. Zombies?\n\nHumans vs. Zombies (HvZ for short) is a sort of role playing game with two main sides. Humans, and Zombies. Humans, armed with Nerf blasters and socks, go around doing missions. While the Zombies armed with noodles and shields, try to tag all the Human players.\n\n\nThe game started off in 2005 at Goucher College, and has since grown to be played in many colleges and locations in the states and around the world. These games in Camarillo started in 2008, and haven played there almost every Summer and Winter. The games usually average 70-80 players, with the games growing a little bit each year.\n\n\nVideo Trailer:\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDPvEMuOQs\n\n\nFacebook Event Link:\n\n\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/744045465674279/\n\nRules &amp; Game Map:\n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/DsQFu\n\n\n\nJoin or View our Facebook Group:\n\n\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/57414061936/\n\n\n\nOur Game Site.

    "postText": "Hello all\n\nI am a student that transfered over to UCSB, got rejected from the CS program and got put into my selected secondary major.\n\nLong story short, I regret it and am looking to transfer to this school. I hear great things about the CS program at this school, the worst part is that when I first went to this school in person I found it very charming, but my dumbass chose prestige over the right choice. Our program for statistics and data science is shit and full of professors that don't know what they are teaching.\n\nYour help is greatly appreciated yall :)",

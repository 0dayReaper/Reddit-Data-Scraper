Is the curriculum good, was it hard to get internships, was getting a job after graduation difficult, etc.? Any input is appreciated.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the feedback guys. I wasn't expecting to get so much great info as this sub isn't the most active so I appreciate your guys' time!",

            "comment": "I haven't had any trouble finding paid internships(yet), and all the CS majors I know found employment after graduation fairly painlessly. There is quite a bit of tech in the surrounding area and the CS department gets emailed with job offers for students and graduates fairly regularly. The department chair, Michael Soltys, posts some on his [twitter](https://twitter.com/MichaelMSoltys).\n\nAs for curriculum, I can't really compare it to other schools as it's the only place I've really taken a lot of CS courses. I attended Moorpark college for a bit, and I can say that I enjoy the Math courses at CSUCI far more than the ones I had at Moorpark. A lot of the math classes are comprised of CS students, and the professors are aware of this and try to cater to CS students somewhat. A nice thing about CSUCI are the small class sizes. I don't think I've ever been in a class with more than 40 students. My current CS classes are hovering around 20 students, same with Math. It's nice to have your professors be really accessible for help or questions. The computer science department also provides its own tutoring services, so there are essentially 3 separate places on campus you can go for computer science help, and I think they have peer-led team learning for some of the lower level CS courses. \n\nAs for the curriculum in general, one thing that CSUCI does that can be a bit jarring is that your first two courses (Intro to Programming and Data Structures) are taught entirely in Java. Then you move onto Programming Languages and essentially have a week to learn C, which is the language you use for the remainder of your education. Some people found the transition very jarring, especially since you aren't really \"taught\" C, rather, you are taught the foundations of programming through Java and then expected to learn C on your own. That said, Intro to Programming and Data Structures are both extremely good courses, and I got an internship from those two courses alone making Android applications. \n\nI think most people will agree that Operating Systems and Programming Languages will be your two hardest courses. You'll be given a short lecture and then have the weekend to complete a lab assignment. They both require a lot of self teaching, but I think that's par the course for CS programs and like I said before CSUCI has a lot of CS tutoring available. \n\nOverall, I think the curriculum is very practical, and the CS department has a lot of really great professors that are almost universally praised. \n\nIf you have any other questions for a current CS student, I'd be glad to answer them.

                    "comment": "First off thanks for the very thorough reply! I do have a couple questions that maybe you could help me with.\n\nI'm actually a Ventura local and have actually am actually in the second C++ course at Moorpark right now. Thing is I wasn't actually originally a CS major (was actually just doing pre-pharm) so I really don't have many CS courses let alone math classes under my belt, but after taking these couple classes I'm sure I want to stick with CS. What I'm trying to get at is that as an older student still at a cc I'm just trying to graduate already. I have actually spoke with a csuci representative when they came to Ventura College (taking classes there too) and was assured that I'd most likely be accepted into the cs department next fall as its not very impacted. So I guess my options are to quickly continue with my schooling at ci or I could stay at the very least another year at cc to try to get into a higher ranked school (not saying csuci isn't good). With your experience there have you ever had any trouble registering for classes that fill up fast or having to wait for a class that's not offered a certain semester?\n\nAlso how is the vibe between the CS student body? Do people seem to take everything as more of a competition or do you find more people trying to help each other out?\n\nThe fact that you haven't had trouble finding any internships is also very reassuring. I've come to accept the fact that I most likely won't be working for a big tech company like many people in /r/cscareerquestions do, but as long I can get a decent job upon graduation I am more than okay. Do you happen to be apart of or know of a CS club that could potentially lead to internships/jobs? If you don't mind me asking could you also elaborate on how you/your classmates found internships or jobs. Have you or anybody you know also made connections with professors that opened doors?\n\nI know I'm asking a lot of questions so you don't have to hit every little details, but thanks in advance haha\n\n\n\n",

Most upper division CS classes don't even fill up.\n\n&gt;Also how is the vibe between the CS student body? Do people seem to take everything as more of a competition or do you find more people trying to help each other out?\n\nThis probably varies person to person, and even class to class. People don't actively \"try\" to help each other out, as a lot of CS is just thinking things through on your own. But I made friends at this school fairly easily and we all help each other when we need it. For Operating Systems and Programming Languages, you're generally allowed to talk to the people sitting next to you during labs if you need some direction. Overall I think the people in the CS major are pretty friendly.\n\n&gt; I've come to accept the fact that I most likely won't be working for a big tech company like many people in /r/cscareerquestions do, but as long I can get a decent job upon graduation I am more than okay\n\nPlenty of CS students from CSUCI go on to places like Google on Amazon. If you have the drive, you can do it, but you'll definitely have to go above and beyond what most do. \n\n&gt;Do you happen to be apart of or know of a CS club that could potentially lead to internships/jobs? If you don't mind me asking could you also elaborate on how you/your classmates found internships or jobs. Have you or anybody you know also made connections with professors that opened doors?\n\nI personally have gotten internships through my professors, and through the emails the CS department sends out, and I know people who've gotten internships from the job fair. I don't know of anyone who actively searched for an internship and couldn't find one. As long as you do well in your classes, learn the material, and respect your professors, I can't imagine having too much trouble finding an internship.\n\n",

Nothing really that will help with your career much.  If you want to find the kind of experience that will help with your career, it would probably be better to get involved with some of the various research projects going on.  They usually bring business from outside the school and use their problems as a way to get students to help find solutions, and can often result in more for you afterwards.\n\nGood luck with whatever you do :)",

            "comment": "Chandy hit the nail on the head on pretty much everything I was going to talk about (also, what's up Chandy!); personally, I think the practical approach to the core computer science classes are great and why I think CS is one of the stronger majors at Channel Islands in general, though it isn't perfect.\n\nDon't get me wrong, you will be challenged and you will learn some incredibly valuable skills and lessons, and the professors for the most part are fantastic, but I think the biggest flaw with Channel Islands' CS program is the lack of software engineering principles that you'll learn without doing it on your own (which you absolutely should!). As far as I know, Richard Wasniowski is still the professor teaching that course, and while he's a really nice guy, I believe he's been longing to retire and has just stopped making much of an effort to teach anything in that class. Case in point, despite it being Comp 350, an upper-division course, I got an A+ (as many others also did) extremely easily, where I had to work pretty damn hard to get A's in some of the other classes. And it sucks too, because in the working environment you'll be exposed to lots of practices regarding version control, code review, etc., assuming the institution you work for actually gives two craps about that.\n\nSo, in short, I think the curriculum is pretty damn great, but take it upon yourself to learn some software engineering concepts on your own. Start using Git, SVN, or some other type of version control software (it's not too hard to learn and it's cool to see how it works, not to mention it will be awesome for maintaining any projects you work on).\n\nPersonally I didn't find it too difficult to get internships, though I had more of an IT focus before I ended up landing my software development gig I'm in now, but my friends and other people I knew who went to CI didn't have too difficult of a time landing some type of CS-related internship. As long as your resume looks good and you can nail the interview, and have a decent amount of ambition to back it up to get your foot in the door, you shouldn't have too much of a problem.\n\nAs for full-time work, it really depends on the market and where you're job searching, though currently I would say it's not too difficult as long as you have the competence and skills, and a bit of experience (internships!) to get yourself into a junior role.",

                    "comment": "Okay I see. Being completely honest I'm not very aware of the concepts that set software engineering separate from general CS. I have noticed however that some universities will offer a major in both CS and software engineering or will offer one and not the other.\n\nDid not really having the most challenging software engineering course seem to hinder your progress outside of school? Are there any upper-div electives that you would recommend to learn some of the software you mentioned (Git, SVN,etc.)? I'm not trying to sound like I want everything there for me as I am more than willing to try to learn those on my own given that they are not too intense, and if that is really the only flaw in the curriculum I think it's not really a big factor that could change my mind.\n\nAlso on a side note did you ever have trouble getting the classes you wanted? I'd be an older transfer student and am really looking to get a degree as soon as possible. I know some CSU's are really impacted and trying to register for certain classes can be a complete pain.",

Actually I wouldn't say it was hindered too much, but certain software engineering concepts like version control are definitely important to know and, thankfully, not too difficult to learn on your own time (plenty of tutorials everywhere that have been super helpful for me personally), so that, by the time you get to mid-level or even senior-level jobs in your career and assume more responsibility, stuff like that should definitely be on your resume no questions asked.\n\n&gt; Also on a side note did you ever have trouble getting the classes you wanted?\n\nNot really for my major courses unless the class size was unusually small.

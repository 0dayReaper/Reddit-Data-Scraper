    "postText": "I wonder about the quality of education at CSUCI. I will most likely transfer there for Fall 2017 as a Business / Finance Major and I would really like to know your opinions regarding the quality of education at CSUCI. \n\nI also have another question. Since CSUCI is not an impacted school, do you guys struggle to get the classes you need in order to graduate on time?\n\nThank you!",

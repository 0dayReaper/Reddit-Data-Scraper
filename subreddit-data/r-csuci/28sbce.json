The classrooms don't hold much so they look fuller than there are students in the class, I've only had trouble getting one of my classes so far but I believe that's because it is a class both IT and comp sci needs.\n\n2) job opportunities are fantastic, I'm about to start my third year and I've already been working an internship for about a year now\n\n3) the teachers are great they all have great senses of humor and like to make the class fun as well as challenge you at the same time\n\n4) very well, if you love programming stick with it, I'd suggest skipping comp 101, and shooting to 105 or even 150 (only if you have java script under your belt)\n\nGood luck! Hope to see you around",

            "comment": "I am a CS/Math Double major at CI and after this summer will be graduating next year. I just finished my 4th of 5 years. I work with a few of the MS in CS students and have taken all of the undergraduate CS courses.\n\nTo answer some questions:\n\n**1) how many students per class on average?**\nFreshman to Sophomore classes - 20-25 people.\nJunior to Senior classes - 10-20 people.\nMy norm is like 10-15 people a class now. MS stuff is about the same I think, 10-20 people.\n\n**2) how are the job opportunities, recruiters, any career fairs?**\nThere seem to mainly be job opportunities if you have proven yourself in class and can be recommended by a professor. Professor AJ on campus has many connections with companies if you show him you are quality.\n\nThere are career fairs yearly (semesterly maybe). There are many CS related fields visible there and looking to hire or hand out info. If you are interested in website work, there are many companies in the area that will throw jobs at you. These jobs may be lower paying but apparently the staff are excellent and fun to work with, so I am told. There are also many military contracting type companies around and they seem to be hiring many of the MS in CS people and recent math and CS undergrad graduates that I know.\n\n**3) how are the teachers and faculty like?**\nJust a few of the undergrad professors are terrible. There are 2-3 that are not very good but the full time tenured professors are excellent. Professor AJ is one of my favorite professors to take a class with. I recommend the upper division faculty for CS and CI. The Math department is also very very good for faculty.\n\n**4) overall, how would you rate the experience?**\nI would not recommend an undergraduate double major ONLY because to really learn all the material you need the time and taking 18 units a semester and working part time just spreads you too thin. Especially in CS where maybe getting some work experience would be useful in place of a few units.\n\nFor a MS in CS, I understand the professors are all pretty good. The MS program just changed to me more math centric, which may or may not be your thing. In fact, I believe I was told the program may be run through the mathematics department now. \n\nI in general have had a positive experience for about half my undergraduate CS classes and all my Math classes. I really recommend the mathematics department at CI. If you want more information about the MS in CS program, contact Dr. AJ directly. AJ can help, and wants to help, you with MS info.\n\nBest of luck!",

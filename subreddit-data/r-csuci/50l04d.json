    "postText": "I'm transferring out of my local CC next fall and CSUCI is exactly what I'm looking for in a school: tons to do, beautiful surrounding area (INCREDIBLE roads for my motorcycle), and more on the lax side compared to the party schools in the surrounding area. However, I'm coming from a school of 10,000+, and I'm worried it might just be a little too quiet. Does it ever feel just a little too small?  \n  \nAlso, how is the English program specifically? The tour I went on didn't cover the program specifically, but they offer what I want (English with emphasis in education) and I haven't seen anything bad about it online. Anyone care to vouch? ",

            "comment": "I'm not an English major, so I wont be able to go in depth about the program. I have met people who are English majors and they seem to enjoy it but everyone will have a custom experience.\n\nAre you going to be living on campus? If you aren't from the surrounding area, I'd seriously consider living on campus. I know a lot of commuters hate the school because they find it hard to make and keep friends outside of the classroom (which is funny because everyone always says the same thing but always decide to skip events or don't join a club, so they basically put no effort). \n\nI come from San Diego also, and I transferred from a very large community college. I absolutely LOVE the fact that class sizes are so small. I sometimes wished that I had a class in like a massive theater with hundreds of other students just to find out what it feels like, but then I remember that because class sizes are so small (Approx 25 ppl in each class), I get more 1 on 1 attention from the teacher and we are able to build a connection which I think helps build a much stronger educational background because you'll WANT to study, and do your work, etc. \n\nI love waking up and having the campus smell like strawberries and cilantro in the morning because of the farms that surround us. I love having such a quiet campus (though not for lack of parties, there definitely are TONS of parties on campus, but people are usually pretty considerate so it may be inconspicuous at first glance), and there's so much to do in the surrounding areas that there is no way you can ever get bored unless you don't allow yourself to do anything. \n\nOverall, no matter what school you go to, you will only get out what you put into it. Come to CI if you want to be able to get to know your teachers, do better in your classes, get killer recommendations from faculty who have industry experience, if you love the beach, if you love hiking, shopping, good food, great company (EVERYONE is super nice at this school, and one of our unofficial customs is to hold doors open for others, just a fun little fact! We can tell if youre new if you don't hold it open! haha), and beautiful views.\n\nI've never once regretted or felt disheartened coming to CI after not being able to get into SDSU because I realized that at SDSU I would have given bare minimum to pass classes, would have never known my professors, and I definitely would not have had the opportunities I've had so far here at CI. \n\nIf I could give you one piece of advice, it's to join a club. Find something you enjoy doing, and either join or create a club to make finding friends so much easier and more on target.\n\nGood luck and we hope to see you on campus sometime soon!",

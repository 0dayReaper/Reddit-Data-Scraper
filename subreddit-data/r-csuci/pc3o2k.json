I\u2019m a big football fan and thought \u201cWhat better way to meet people than starting a fantasy football league?\u201d If you are interested in joining and/or wanting to make some new friends, hit me up on Instagram @connor.polanco, my Snapchat connorpopo5, or just let me know in the replies. The buy-in will be $5 and winners will be for 1st-4th place (given the idea that we get enough people, of course, and 16 players max). The league will run through ESPN Fantasy and be a PPR League. To anyone new to fantasy, it is super easy and simple. We already have a few people that are down but the more the better. Anyways, hopefully this sparks some interest and I hope you have a great day!",

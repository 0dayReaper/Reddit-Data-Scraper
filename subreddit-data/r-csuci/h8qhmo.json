    "postText": "Hello everyone, incoming psychology transfer here! I have a few questions about classes for Fall 2020. \n\nMany upper division psychology courses show that they are closed/ full. Will spots open up for transfer students when we are allowed to register? \n\nAlso, does anyone know if we have to attend online zoom lectures for courses showing time frames? \n\nTIA",

Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be fine. As per your other question, the official answer is yes, but it depends on your professor whether they take attendance or not. Regardless, i recommend you don\u2019t skip out because it\u2019s easy to fall behind with everything online now",

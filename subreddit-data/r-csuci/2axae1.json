    "postText": "Asking for a friend who just graduated from Cal Poly SLO and got a job in North Oxnard - he's got about 3-5 weeks to pin down a place. I'm a native, and everyone I know out there is already either living at home or with people. So if you or someone you know is looking for a roommate on this short notice, or if you know of a studio or something in the area, any info would be awesome. Craigslist just hasn't been great for what he's looking for.\n\nHere's his (hopeful) criteria:\n\n* The closer to The Collection area, the better\n* Younger, generally chill people (around college age would be cool)\n* His own room\n* Willing to commute if at least near the freeway\n* 420-friendly would be nice\n* Cheaper is better, but might be willing to go up to $1000 on a studio\n\nSo yeah, if you know someone or have suggestions, any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

He doesn't even need to live with other people to hit under $1000 with all utilities.",

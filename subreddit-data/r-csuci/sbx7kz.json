    "postText": "Hey I'm a 23(f) from LA who transferred to CSUMB last fall. In short , my experience has sucked! The city is beautiful but VERYY touristy, classes + professors are chill. BUT everyone is very quite and haven't been able to make any friends!!! Also there is no diversity, probably 1 hispanic out of 10 you'll see. Is channel island any better? I understand both schools are not \"party schools\" and not big on sports but is there more going on?? ( COVID has not helped with my experience either ).",

            "comment": "Our campus is farmland and the neighboring Camarillo is suburban. As a city slicker from LA, there are a few local spots here but it's not much. To get to a place with a nightlife you need to drive 25ish minutes to Ventura. Our student body mainly consists of commuters so our campus is also very quiet, even more so due to the reduced capacity. It is essentially a ghost town on the weekends. If you want to meet people you have to try moderately hard.\n\nWe have a pretty active school club scene and popular areas to hang out in, but beyond that we all mainly keep to ourselves. \n\nIn terms of diversity, our campus is majority female. From my experience there is a good spread of every racial group, with majority Latino/Hispanic. A cursory Google search gives you [this campus demographics breakdown.](https://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/california-state-university-channel-islands/student-life/diversity/#gender_diversity)\n\nMost people don't come here for the student life, they come here for the degree and price tag.",

I like the environment and the quietness but people are still pretty social. Now it just depends on the major ur in and if you feel the program is worth it. I use to go to a private university and it was great and social but they had a terrible environmental program.",

The school isn't even allowed to go up it, they just own the property and use it only for fire roads. \n\nThere are mountains in University park (next to UGlen) which you can park your car at and access for free if you're a student. The park does close at sunset though, so you can't stay overnight if parked. You can also walk up to Uglen and access them through the trails going out back there. I think you can use the trail next to the dog park, otherwise you might have to hop the fence to the closed off housing area. The really big mountains are connections from the Santa Monica's, Mt.Boney and the Tri Peaks. You can access those from the Santa Monica Park Mtns trailhead.",

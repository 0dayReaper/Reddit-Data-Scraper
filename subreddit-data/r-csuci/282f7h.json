If you are a programmer (Python/C++) at the very least who is interested in IoT, Robotics, Computer perception, microcontrollers, 3D Printing, etc then we might have a great opportunity. \n\nThere is plenty of opportunity for advancement and permanent part or full time employment based on performance.  If you would like an opportunity to be in on the ground level pm me and we can meet for coffee, pho, or something.",

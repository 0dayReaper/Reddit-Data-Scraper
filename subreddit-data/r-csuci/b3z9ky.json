    "postText": "Hey everyone, \n     Im from the San Diego area and I've recently been accepted in CSUCI as a micro bio major (transferring from a CC). I just wanted to ask how does everyone afford to dorm or live in the area? \n    Ive been doing some math and it seems that after grants id still have to come up with 19,000 a year to live on campus. Im making trip up to CSUCI tomorrow to maybe sit down with someone and ask but id also like to ask current students here. \n\nTLDR: How does everyone afford college?",

My friend's twins rent a one bedroom &amp; one of them has the bedroom &amp; the other the screened off living room. There are some apartments for $1700/month. \n\nMy daughter lives at home but doesn't drive. You can piece together public transportation. Dial a Ride to the metro station &amp; bus goes directly to campus from there every 30 minutes. \n\nCamarillo is expensive. Living on campus is the most expensive. ",

            "comment": "Hey, so I actually transferred to CSUCI from San Diego also  almost 2 years ago and now I am graduating in May. I never lived on campus. I decided that I wanted my own place so I move into an apartment. I did the math and living on campus was going to be the same amount and I rather be comfortable with a place of my own.  Rent in Ventura county compared to San Diego is way more expensive. The housing our here just sucks. I worked full time and also went to school my first year, it was hard but manageable. Now Im working part time because my boyfriend decided to move in and we split the expenses. So unfortunately, working is kinda necessary.  I would suggest renting a room,  there is a lot of students I know that live off of campus and share apartments.  I did take out two loans to pay for some of my some classes and other stuff like, books, food and gas but I'm glad I didn't take out anymore loans to live on campus. Thanks to that I'll be graduating with only 12k in loans.  CI is not your typical campus, it's small  but has this homey feel to it.  Moving from a big city like San Diego was a big change but honestly I'm so glad I did it. I like that I can walk around campus and know everyone, professors  have time to speak with you one on one since the class sizes are small.  I guess it just depends on what you are looking for. Feel free to message me if you have any other questions! ",

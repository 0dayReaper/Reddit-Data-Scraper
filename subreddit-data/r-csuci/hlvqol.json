    "postText": "I've paid for orientation, accepted admission, and even gotten the confirmation email response for the orientation. A day after the deadline (July first) I get an email that my admission was canceled. I've emailed em along with the confirmation number the day after as that was when I saw the email but I'd have to wait for a response. Been messed with like this on every single application for some reason this semester with the department saying my application has been withdrawn because I didn't fulfill a requirement even though they have record of it. This has nothing to do with my GPA, just strictly saying I didn't take a class or complete a step (with confirmation).\n\nHaving my doubts already with a mandatory paywall b4 sending transcripts I have yet to send mine in, now I'm not sure if I should even send them? Even though the deadline for transcripts is only getting closer? Having a dilemma here as on one hand I might be getting scammed $50 and on the other I might be cutting it close on another deadline if it was a mistake.",

I was 58/60 Units needed for transfer, my community college guidance counselors missed it the 4 times I went in and asked if everything was good to go.\nI'd check and make sure you met all of the requirements for transfer/admission.\n\nIf everything is good to go you can try appealing it once you hear back from them.\n\nGood luck!",

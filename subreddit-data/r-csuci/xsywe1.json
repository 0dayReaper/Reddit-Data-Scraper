But I understand that's not everyone's cup of tea), parking can get hard to find, and on weekends and evenings the campus is dead. Don't come here if you want a high level social experience lol.",

            "comment": "Agree with the other comment 100%. Also, I don't know what bigger campuses are like, but my biology classes have really inflexible schedule requirements. If you don't want to be on campus at least 4 days a week, trying to make a STEM major with lab reqs work can be exhausting. \n\nThe only other complaint I can think of is if you take the bus or don't arrive super early to snipe the good parking, it can be a bit of a walk to get around campus. On a busier schedule with suboptimal parking, I'd walk about 1.5 - 2 miles getting from my car to classes and back. \n\nThe town center has some good food. I highly recommend Tortillas Grill and Cantina.",

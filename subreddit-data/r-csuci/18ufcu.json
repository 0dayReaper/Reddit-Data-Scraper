    "postText": "I'm currently at a community college and I am interested in CSUCI once I get my general ed done. I plan to major in Computer Science or Information Technology (probably CS with a minor in IT)\n\nSince CSUCI is a relatively small school, I was wondering how many classes were available. Is it easy to get into the classes? Also, say I need to take Statistics... is there only a couple of classes or are there a few, which are spread out throughout the day?\n\n",

            "comment": "The schedule changes every semester, but they seem to do a decent job with the arrangement.  I'm in the CompSci department and have never had any trouble getting into the classes I need, or even in some circumstances changing the scheduled time to meet my needs.  As I've been working a full-time schedule as well, I have had teachers allow me to take some if the elective classes online as well.  I have heard of other people having trouble getting in to classes, but from what I ca tell, it's not very common, as long as you register before the deadline approaches.\n\nThere are usually several different sections for each class, spread out throughout the week.  Some meeting at different times as well as different days.\n\nCompSci with IT is a great path to take.  One thing you may want to consider, though, is that as a CompSci major, you are also obtaining a math minor by default since the classes required for the math minor overlap with those of the CompSci major.\n\nHope that's helpful.",

While the required math classes net you most of the units you need for the minor, I think you would have to take Scientific Computing in order to not have to go out of your way to take an otherwise unnecessary math class to graduate.\n\nBut yeah, I have had very little trouble getting into my non-GE classes. Seniority also helps, although I don't know if third-year transfer students have the same priority as third-year students who have been at CSUCI since their freshman year.",

It required me taking a few electives that doubled up with the math minor ones though.  I also didn't have to take scientific for mine.",

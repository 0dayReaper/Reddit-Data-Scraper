    "postText": "I am planning to move this Fall as a transfer student and found an opportunity to rent out a bedroom at University Glen which is located right next to campus. I am not from the area so I was wondering if anyone knew anything about the place and if it would be a good place to stay. Is there lots of students there etc.. Any other advice in general would be great as I am unfamiliar of the area since I'm from the Central Valley. Thanks!!",

Nearby restaurants at Town Center and the Broome Library too.\n\nHopefully some current students can hop on this post and potentially provide some more up-to-date info.",

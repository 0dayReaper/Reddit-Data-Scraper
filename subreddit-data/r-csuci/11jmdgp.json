    "postText": "Hi, I got admitted as a freshman for this fall but I,m pretty nervous about moving and not knowing anyone there. I'll be living on campus so I'm sure I'll meet people but knowing its a commuter school I'm still worried. Does anyone have any ideas on how to meet more people before its time to move?",

CI can be a hard school to meet people beforehand cause it\u2019s a pretty small school. I definitely recommend  getting out there once you live on campus cause it can get kinda lonely without friends. Loved that school.",

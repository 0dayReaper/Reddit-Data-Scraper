There are some people who have jobs in the field of Performing Arts, others who don't. Some are auditioning for parts in famous theatre companies in New York, others stay closer to home. Unfortunately, I didn't get a clear answer out of these people, and that makes me terrified as to what awaits me after I transfer to and graduate from CI.",

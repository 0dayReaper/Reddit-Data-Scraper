Would you please, for the love of God, consider posting ads on the school's cork boards in the SUB, library, or Rec Center, or even taking out an ad in the school newspaper at least two weeks in advance of your event? Or raid classrooms? That would be cool too.",

Those were the main sources of event info a few years back (mainly Facebook)....\n\nCI View ads &amp; printing flyers cost money that they probably don't have (that is, unless clubs/orgs started receiving free printing &amp; ad space in the past few years...)",

I only see event notices the day of, or the day after. Same with Sync. It's ridiculous.\n\nI visit other colleges, like USC, or Chapman, or even state schools like LB, Fullerton, or SB, and they have cork boards littered everywhere! And they have ads for every single imaginable club or event, both on and off campus! Hell, at my old high school, we had schedules for the sporting events, same for my JC when it came to music events.\n\nI go to see choir concerts on the cheap at LB State and USC. Why? Because they send me a notice on the feeds I'm subscribed to over a month in advance!\n\nHere? Nothing, and with nobody to complain to.\n\nEx: I can't see any of our Lacrosse teams play because they don't post a schedule anywhere. There's a massive monstrosity of a cork board on the 1st floor of the SUB. Do they use it? Of course not! Putting a standard sized piece of paper with the team logo, name of opponent, as well as the place, date, and time of the game that one can print out on the 2nd floor of the SUB for as little as $.05 would too easy! /s\n\nSame with our choir (did you know CI has a choir?) Only place you can see ads for the choir is at Malibu Hall, which is where they practice. Absolutely nowhere else.",

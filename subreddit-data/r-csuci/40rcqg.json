I want to move to the Santa Barbara area and therefore am looking at CSUCI as a transfer option. I'm just wondering if anyone here is currently in the nursing program and what they think of it?",

If you're living in SB try to go to the Goleta campus, otherwise it'll be a bitch for you to commute back and forth from Camarillo.\n\n\nI attended the one in Cam, but everyone else seemed to like the SB one. Anything specifically you want to know? I can't complain because I got skills that got me a good job, but otherwise feel free to ask away.",

The BSN will get your foot in a door but the extra experience that you get from community health and leadership with local hospitals really gives you an advantage.",

Your fiance should have a high GPA (I'm talkin close to 4.0) with health care experience (volunteer or work) and proof of learning a second language (through college classes or a fluency exam). Past military service and being a local resident helps too. It's all points based, and the more points you have the better. The program should outline the requirements for points on the website.",

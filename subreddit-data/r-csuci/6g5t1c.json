If you stay shut inside your room all the time and don't put in effort though, don't expect people to come to you because they wont. Try to join these clubs early in the semester. I believe clubs can start holding meetings after the second week of school. If you get in early you'll be more likely to meet others who are new as well and itll be easier then trying to join half way into the semester when everyone is already in their smaller groups and its harder to break into them at that stage.",

There's clubs for everything from Anime to Zumba and some sports teams (The people on the sailing team are chill). You'll also meet people in classes, in the student union building, etc... Tons of people will be in the exact same boat as you at the beginning of the semester, so don't be afraid to reach out. You'll be fine. ",

Too bad, because either you have to go to work during all the times that they can study, or they have to work during the times you wanna study. Wanna work out buddy? Too bad, the gym closes at 11pm and doesn't open until 10 the next morning. Wanna live at the school? Too bad, it's $20,000 for a stripped-down Motel 6 that you have to share with at least three spoiled freakin' mutants. Wanna attend club meetings? Too bad, because they never post their schedules until the day after the meetings. Same with club sports. I've never seen our club sports play because they never post the schedules anywhere. Not in the SUB, not in the library, not on the hundreds of thousands of cork boards littered throughout campus, not on the school newspaper, not on Facebook or Reddit or anywhere. It's almost like they don't want anyone to go to their games.\n\nOverall, I've had an awful time networking here. I have an easier time networking back at my old junior college or even at the high school I graduated from five years ago than I do at CI.\n\nOf course, others have had better success. Best of luck to you, kid.",

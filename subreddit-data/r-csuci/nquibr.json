    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nTo any reading this who are in or have completed the ms/mba dual masters program in biotechnology at csuci, I am interested in this program. I am looking at my options and have considered this among a few at other schools. I also went to csuci for a bs in biology, so I am confident acceptance would be fairly easy for me. I also like biotechnology, so that's a plus, it's more affordable for me, and it also allows me to get a masters while figuring out what I want to do for a phD. Why not get another degree or two while deciding and working at the same time, I stead of just working and gap yearing? That's the way I see it. \n\nPlease let me know your thoughts. Would you recommend? Looking back, would you go somewhere else into another program? Pros and cons? Etc. \n\nThanks so much. I appreciate any input .",

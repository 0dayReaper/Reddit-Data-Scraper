Just because everywhere I look for filming locations, it doesn\u2019t say Camarillo was ever a place they filmed at. Also it looks so much bigger than the well in the movie!",

Idk if they put all filming location or not in credits or whatever, but I doubt the school is lying about it. Kinda petty if they are I can see them kinda maybe manipulating the well to there liking with CGI or effects to make it look smaller and stuff.",

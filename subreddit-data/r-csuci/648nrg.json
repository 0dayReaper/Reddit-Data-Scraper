    "postText": "Hello! I am a female student and I currently rent a single room with a private bath out of a two bedroom home in Camarillo. I will be away for the summer, (mid June to mid September), and I am looking for someone to sublet my room while I am gone. The dates are definitely flexible. This is a nice, quiet neighborhood and I live with a couple and a small dog. I also have a pet ball python (Reduced rent if you could care for him!)\n\nThe room is also furnished, but if you have your own things we can work something out.\n\nPictures upon request.",

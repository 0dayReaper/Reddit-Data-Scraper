    "postText": "I've noticed that CSUCI, like the rest of VC, is starting to fall into a predictable pattern of rising and falling air quality from these fires and winds. Very early in the morning, very late in the evening, and at night the air quality's healthy. During the day when it's warmer, the air quality sucks.\n\nI've already sent an email pointing this pattern out to the school, since this morning they had people come to campus because the air quality was decent then and then abruptly cancelled classes at like 10:45 this morning because the air quality turned to shit again.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea how the school is going to deal with this? Is there any way to work around the predictable periods of bad air quality, or should CSUCI just prep for its losses and completely cancel for the next few days until air quality's safe all day long?",

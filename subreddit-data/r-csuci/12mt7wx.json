            "comment": "I had a class at my junior college where an assignment required us to interview a professional in our field. I ended up choosing one of my computer science professors - super friendly and awesome guy. It was really informal, we met up at Starbucks and I asked him questions about his career. It gave me a lot of insight into the professional world and was where I really started to network.\n\nFrom there, I made it a habit to keep meaningful relationships with professors- you never know when you\u2019ll need a letter of recommendation or a reference for a job. From there I landed a really nice internship (with his letter of recommendation!) and met tons of amazing and well-respected people. After my internship was over, I was able to find my first professional job and, you guessed it, had a ton of references who vouched for me.\n\nIt\u2019s all about taking that first step, and everything else comes naturally in a way..Indeed and LinkedIn are good places to look for internships. I believe CI might have a list of available internships for students. Hope this helps!",

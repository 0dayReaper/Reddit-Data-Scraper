I know that CSUCI isn't much of a party school but I've never been to a party before and I really want to go to at least one. I've heard that dorms can get pretty crazy and also frats but how would I know about them?",

Avoid parties if you want to stay negative and be allowed on campus.\n\nTotally understandable to want to have fun while in college, but just be extra careful these days since breakthrough cases are a thing (not a super common thing, but they exist). Best of luck!\n\n(disclaimer: I graduated ~8 years ago, so take this with a grain of salt)",

Every so often they\u2019ll be house parties off campus that students host and go to. You just have to know someone to keep you in the loop. Don\u2019t worry just get involved and your bound to meet THAT person.",

Also the reason why the pandemic won't end is because not enough people are getting vaccinated which isn't allowing for herd immunity. I get that I might've asked the wrong question at the wrong time but there's no reason to get triggered about it and call me a \"degenerate hippie\".  I've been doing my part in keeping myself and others safe throughout this whole entire pandemic. So just give me a break when I'm just trying to find something to look forward too in the future.",

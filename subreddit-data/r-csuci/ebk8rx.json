    "postText": "Hey guys so I checked my student portal and went to the 'view my application\" section and it said I was admitted before I got the email/mail from the school. I am transferring with an AA  in anthropology to hopefully get a BA in anthropology or archeology.  I wanted to stay in campus but I dont have a clue over all on what I'll for sure pay over to the school as my cal grants haven't been sent out yet as it is very early.\nI wanted to ask you guys if staying there was really expensive or deuable compare to others universities and if it's worth it? (student life) wise and Also is anthropology there a good choice? Anacapa/town center sounds good but the prices are crazy lol \nThanks for the read and hope to hear from you guys options/answers :)",

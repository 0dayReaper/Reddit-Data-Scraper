    "postText": "Hey guys, So I am in incoming transfer(Junior, male 20) to Channel Islands and honestly I have been pretty lost throughout most of the process because I am the first in my family to attend a university. Bu anyways, I just paid my deposit for staying in the dorms and am looking for potential roommates and even just some friends. I like to go out and have fun but also enjoying staying in some days. I'm hoping to make the most of the 2 years of college I have left and yes I know CI isn't a party school but I want to have as much fun as I can. Anyways I feel like I'm dragging on but I created a roommate group on the housing app called \"eldenspring\" feel free to check it out!",

Living on campus is a great way to meet people so you're off to a good start! I also recommend looking into clubs and orgs that interest you, it's a really easy way to find people with similar interests. And go to events, even if they seem lame, it will help you get involved in the campus community and make some connections. CI is a chill place but because it's mainly a commuter campus it can be hard to organically make friends. If you put yourself out there though, you'll be fine. Congrats on being a first gen student, there are tons of resources available to support your campus experience so make sure to check the website and take advantage of them! Best of luck, feel free to DM me if you have any questions!",

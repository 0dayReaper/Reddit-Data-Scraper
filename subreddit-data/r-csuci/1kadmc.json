Last year i discovered this subreddit but found it ultimately devoid of posts so i tried to change it, but unfortunately freshman year got the most of my time. Now a sophomore I think i have had enough experience at CI that I can try again.\nFirst off I'd like to suggest the changing of mods to ensure that mods still currently attend, while some alumni may also be mods.\nAny other suggestions would be great.",

Also, possibly advertising our existence on the other local Reddits and the big VCRED Facebook page *might* work. I would still proceed with caution though on that front. It may just be the nature of the beast right now though. With only a little over [5,000](https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/college-university-search/california-state-university-channel-islands) full and part time students attending right now and [7,000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSUCI#cite_note-6) (WARNING, PDF) degrees awarded, the school is still relatively small.

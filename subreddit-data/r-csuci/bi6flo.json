Be prepared to learn, and be prepared to work hard, you get out of it what you put into it.\n\nThat being said DO NOT fall behind on your GE's! Make sure to take your Golden Four ASAP (A1, A2, A3, B4). I fell behind on mine and now I have to cram as many GE's per semester as I can. \n\nIt can all be done in 4 years, it's just going to be a lot of units per semester. If you're ok with that, then you won't have an issue.",

            "comment": "It's a very good program. I got a job offer a semester before graduating, and there are lots of internship opportunities and assistance from Career Development Services. Make sure you start applying for internships in your sophomore or junior year! That work experience is essential for getting hired after graduation. Here's a link to the current degree chart: [https://compsci.csuci.edu/degrees/bscs-chart-2018.pdf](https://compsci.csuci.edu/degrees/bscs-chart-2018.pdf) The four years do include general education classes; although only 1/3 of the units for graduation are in general ed. Please let me know if you have any more questions. :)",

Talk to the professors - they are extremely helpful when it comes to getting information on job opportunities and internships.  You can stop by the faculty website and shoot them an email as well.\n\n [https://compsci.csuci.edu/about/faculty.htm](https://compsci.csuci.edu/about/faculty.htm) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe four years does include all the GE's.  Were you considering transferring from a 2-year?  As a transfer student myself, it definitely worked for me.",

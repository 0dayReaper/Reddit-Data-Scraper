I know this sub is kinda dead, but what is everyones overall feel for channel islands? \nI really want to get away from CSUEB because its an extension of my high school, so CSUCI is a definite option for me.

I loved on campus the two years and I made very few friends but I was happy. \n\nPeople are fairly friendly, albeit closed off with it being a commuter school. Everyone on campus had their group from freshman year and that was that. I think that may be the case most places? It kind of sucked at times but people weren't mean.\n\nThe campus is gorgeous. The classrooms are small but functional. Student life is good all things considered. For a commuter school there's a lot going on and the campus does try to engage students in life there. It helps with how secluded it is. \n\nIf you haven't been I really suggest going down and checking it out. \n\nAlso to note it does back up to agriculture so if you're highly allergic to some stuff you may need to bring allergy meds.

And if there if, it's usually kind of lame. But the people are nice, classes are small and concentrated, and it's in a great location. ",

Felt like most of my peers were happy as well, especially since you were essentially getting small, private school type classes for public school prices.",

Everyone I've come across have been friendly and while it is a commuter school, they try to get students involved and there are plenty of clubs as well. It's a great school I'm enjoying it especially since classes are small and the professors actually know you by name. ",

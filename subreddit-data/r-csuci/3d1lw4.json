Idk, thoughts?\n\nEdit: Since I'm getting positive feedback I will continue to pursue this idea. I need at least 5 students to start up a club so if you're interested and you're a student send me a PM so we could start it up quicker. ",

I think you would get a lot of support for a club like that. If you're planning to actually make this club official at the school just keep in mind that there are deadlines and requirements to create clubs. If you haven't looked at it already, if you head over to myCI and click on CI Sync you should be able to find the requirements, or else they'll be on the main website for the school. ",

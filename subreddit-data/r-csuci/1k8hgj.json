My orientation experience was the most lame one I had at CI, which is a good thing. Try to meet your department chair and say hi. Every single one I have met is genuinely interested in helping out all of their students.\n\nSince you are a transfer I assume you'll be in a lot of major courses this semester. Get to know the people you go to class with, all of them. Depending on your major that might be a very small group of people that you will continue to share nearly all your classes with for the next couple years. Classroom chat is usually non-existent in the first couple weeks as everyone is nervous but if you just say hi and introduce yourself to those sitting around you it will kick things off immediately or make the next day even better.\n\nDon't worry about finding fellow redditors, get to know the people who are going to be right in front of you every day and you can have wonderful and lifelong relationships with. Plus, if there are some redditors hiding in there you'll find out soon enough, front page posts have a way of working into conversation.\n\nAh man, there is so much to say about CI. I loved it so much! Just talk to people, faculty, students, staff, they make the experience and present opportunities. \n\nIf you have any questions about CI or your major in particular I'd be happy to answer, mostly because I like talking about the school! (I guess to help a fellow dolphin too or whatever) I was in one of the small science majors so related subjects are my core knowledge base but I met a lot of people while I was there.\n\nHave fun at orientation!",

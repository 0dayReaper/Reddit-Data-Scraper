I know there aren't many sports teams but does that mean people don't like sports at all because I am a sports fanatic. And if you know how the business program is, how is it like? And what should I look forward to at CSUCI? Also, sell me on the school. Sorry that's a lot hahah",

From the sound of your original post it sounds like you want to live on campus. \n\nSo there are lots of things to do on campus, it really depends on what you are into. \n\nThere's a few places to eat and get drinks on campus (if you are old enough to drink that is), including pizza, Mexican, sandwiches, coffee, standard (but tasty) cafeteria fare, and a walk up grill with burgers and the like. Recently opened was a high-end smoothie/meal replacement shop and by fall there will be an Indian restaurant as well. \n\nFor sports on campus we have a fee options. There's the rec center which has lots of classes and intramural sports including basketball, volleyball, dodgeball, flag football, soccer leagues. There's going to be a brand new softball/baseball rec field opening in fall as well. \n\nClasses are also offered at the rec center for various things from dance to yoga. \n\nYou also have clubs for sports as well. Sailing and the bicycle kitchen are big ones but there's also track/tri/swim and a couple of others. \n\nI won't lie to you and tell you this is a big school when it's not (neighborhood of 5k students last year) but it's an awesome community. I actually went to Cal poly SLO for three years before switching majors and transferring to CI. \n\nBest decision I've ever made. You get a lot more attention from your professors. It won't last long, though. CI is a popular school and growing fast so now is the time to go here.\n\nIf you can, definitely check out Discover CI coming up on April 11th and 12th (one day is for freshpeople and the other is for transfer students. \n\nI was a science person so I don't know too much about the business program other than it is solid. I took a couple of cross listed BIO/CHEM/BUS courses, drug discovery and development and bio ethics, and really enjoyed both of those. Also I just graduated and I am considering the MBA here which was one of the first campus programs (technically rough extended ed) and is well established. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions. \n\nEDITS: Grammar, and added the section about the business program.

The University itself has some nice things within its walls. It's not a crazy party school by any means though, really quiet. If you're looking for that, go somewhere else.\n\nI love sports, and their gym is small but really good. Has decent hours, and 4 hoops. So yeah, it's not UCLA grade, but it does the job. There's a soccer field too, and yeah it's actually nothing really. \n\nIt's a quiet, small school. Lots of commuters. It's perfect for me, since I don't like people haha. I can see why some people wouldn't like it. But I love it.",

I'm a very outgoing meet new people type of person but not the biggest partier, how do you think I would fit in? Does that mean that a lot of people are just kind of quiet? Or are there some other people that aren't super shy?",

Most, if not all, of the professors are great and take the time to work with you. I would be weary of the Econ professors as I've had some bad ones. On Fridays there is often a Speaker Series where different influential business figures come and speak (Free lunch included!). Also, there are bus tours to different businesses in the area. I never joined the Business Club, but I hear great things about what they do. ",

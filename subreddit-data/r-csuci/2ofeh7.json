    "postText": "Hello Everyone. I was wondering if any students applying right now have checked their my CI portal and have seen that their application is incomplete. Current students, did this happen to any of you? I'm really nervous because my friend and I both have this notification, but we don't know why as we received the submission that our applications were complete. Is anyone else experiencing this or do you know why this happening? Thank you for your help.",

Either way, make sure you visit a counselor or ESRM head to plan your courses for each semester as some classes are only offered in the spring or only in the fall. I transferred into the ESRM program in 2018 and graduated this last spring. From what I remember, they added a couple more emphasis so you have some freedom as to what you really want to study. I enjoyed the program pre-covid as there was a lot of great lab classes as well as some pretty awesome field trips. All of the ESRM faculty are very passionate about the field they study and show that in their teachings. As any other program, some professors are better than others but with that being said there aren\u2019t any terrible professors. In terms of job market, ESRM has a job board they update frequently for expecting and recent graduates which is pretty neat.\n\nTo expand on your general question, what are you expecting from your college experience? What would make it \u201cworth it?\u201d",

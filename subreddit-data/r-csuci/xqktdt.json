    "postText": "Hi everyone! I don't normally post on here, but I wanted to make sure people were aware: I saw some people collecting signatures for a referendum in the central mall today. The referendum would put a stop on the California FAST act , which is going into effect this year. **The FAST act is a piece of legislation intended to improve workplace standards and minimum wage at fast food locations across the state.**\n\nOne of the petitioners told me the petition was \"for the workers\" until I pressed him, and while the text of the referendum is present on the paper, I want to make sure people know this referendum is anti-union, anti-worker, and backed pretty much entirely by fast food restaurant chains who don't want to have to pay their employees fairly.\n\nMore info on the FAST act can be found [here](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/insights/2022/9/fast-act-becomes-law-in-california-but-voter-referendum-filed-in-response).\n\nThanks for your time and attention. Make sure you read anything anyone visiting campus with petitions asks you to sign!",

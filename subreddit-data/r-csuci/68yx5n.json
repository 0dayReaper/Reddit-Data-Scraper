    "postText": "CSUCI requires all students who dorm to purchase a meal plan. It's an extra expense (around $3K per year) and that alone is making me NOT want to dorm this fall. It's hard enough to pay the $14K for housing, and now were expected to pay an additional $3K for food? That's too much!\n\nIs the meal plan worth the cost or should I just live-off campus with other CSUCI students to save money?",

            "comment": "Housing and board (food) is usually incorporated in the housing costs. I believe $14k is the total for both the room and food. The food at CI is good most of the time but you will definitely get bored if you resort to getting the same thing over and over because its easy to grab. Try to change things up and create your own meals with ingredients from the caf. You can always customize the food you order to make it the way you like it. For example, I would often ask for avocado on my burgers or if there was something in the daily special that I didnt want I could order it without that thing or sub for something else. If you are going to go into serious debt over living on campus my suggestion would be to just live off campus. You can still buy a commuters meal plan if you are going to be at school for a majority of the day and will be going to the caf quite often.",

At that point you're paying $18.75 per entrance for an all you can eat buffet. Which is pretty expensive. There are Mongolian and Korean Buffet's in Camarillo that cost $8-11. There is a 99 Cent store in Camarillo. \n\nIf you have to rely on the bus or a possible future roommates car, I think you should stay on campus.\n\nAlso, if you are commuting to school and relying on the bus, the Ventura Bus network is changing their schedule, it could take a little over an hour to get to campus. https://www.goventura.org/?q=travel-ventura ",

If you visit the school, you can go to Town Center and check out the restaurants/markets around there, AFAIK the meal plan can be used there as well. I think Pizza 3.14 is really good, and Tortillas makes a decent burrito.",

            "comment": "Honestly it depends where you end up living on campus. I believe for any of the on campus housing you have to have some type of meal plan. I lived in Santa Cruz this last school year so we had to do the 160 meals a semester and it was $3,000. We managed to get through the 1st semester okay but by second semester we avoided going to the cafeteria. Same food options everyday gets pretty boring.",

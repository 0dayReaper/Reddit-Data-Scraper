Coming from a cc in a small town, I'm ready to meet new people! What are the best housing options? Do lots of people live on campus at 21? Any and all input appreciated. Thanks!!",

That way you'll meet a lot of people and then save money.\n\n\nYep, quite a few people living there who are 21+. There's a whole housing section (Town Center) where you have to be at least 21 to live there.",

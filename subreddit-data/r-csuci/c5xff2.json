    "postText": "I am excited to be attending CSUCI in this upcoming school year but as I'm shopping around for a place to live, I'm realizing how expensive the area is to rent a place for the year. I am looking for someone to rent a 2 bedroom condo with me where we split rent and utilities. I am open to location, either right by campus or a few minutes away in Camarillo.\n\nAbout me: I am transferring in order to complete my Computer Science bachelors. I'm a guy from Orange County. I don't smoke, drink, or use any drugs. I am clean, organized, and enjoy cooking. I have my own car and will also be seeking employment in the area soon.\n\nI know this ins't the most conventional way to find a room mate but I don't know anyone in that area. If you are interested, please message me. If you have suggestions on how I can find a housemate, please let me know. Thanks reddit and see you fellow dolphins in the fall.",

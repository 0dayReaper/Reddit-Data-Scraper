Sunday is another story- all the weekend warriors heading back to LA really gum up the works. But Saturday is usually cool. \n\nI can't remember if you need a permit to park at SBCC on Saturdays or not, but when I took classes there (admittedly ten years ago) I remember permit fees being reasonable. \n\nSince your class is on Saturday there will be much fewer people around and parking and so forth shouldn't be too bad.

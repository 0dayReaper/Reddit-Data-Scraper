    "postText": "Is anyone from this subreddit in the Global Studies program? If so, I\u2019d like to know the pros and cons in relation to the programs at other CSUs (Long Beach, Dominguez, and SDSU specifically). Is foreign language a requirement, and if so at what level is this requirement considered fulfilled? Is study abroad a requirement? How are the professors/classes? Are there any clubs pertaining or relating to Global Studies?\n\nThere\u2019s really not much information online about their Global Studies program, and I can imagine it\u2019s probably a very small department. I do love the Camarillo/Ventura area, but I don\u2019t want to move two hours away for a lackluster program. Thanks in advance!",

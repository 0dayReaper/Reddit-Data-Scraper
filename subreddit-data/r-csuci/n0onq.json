She apologized to me on behalf of the University and said that she would be having some conversations with those that were involved with the event. \n\nFor those of you who don't know who the Provost is, she is the Vice President for Academic Affairs at our school, and is also in President Rush's cabinet. I would be highly surprised that any event remotely similar to this one ever happens again; finals week or not.",

Incredibly ironic, disruptive, and disrespectful of them to play music in a band in the library on pre-finals week when they are the ones causing us to be there in the first place due to excess amounts of homework, papers, and tests. Not okay in the least bit.",

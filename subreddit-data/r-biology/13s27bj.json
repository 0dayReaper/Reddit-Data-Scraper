    "postText": "My grandma (on my mother's) side had a mitochondrial disorder that is supposedly only displayed in females? I understand mitochondrial DNA is passed on maternally so there's a chance I have it, but why is this one specifically shown in females? Don't males inherit the same mitochondrial DNA? I am unsure of what the actual disorder was called.\nSorry if this is the wrong place to ask, it's just been bugging me since I can't find anything about why males don't have the same chances of getting the disease.",

There absolutely can be sex-based effects in the presentation of mitochondrial disorders (as there are sex-influences features of mitochondrial function). There are X-linked mitochondrial disorders (however one would expect males more than females to present with an X linked inheritance pattern).",

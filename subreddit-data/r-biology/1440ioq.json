Another consideration may be that your last solution wasn\u2019t as concentrated as you may have thought (aka experimental error).. Also worth noting that I practice in gene regulation and haven\u2019t done much gen bio in a while",

            "comment": "Osmosis happens when there are ion gradients between an object (potato) and its environment (the solution). As you increase the solute concentration in your solution (becomes more hypertonic), more water leaves the cells that make up the potato slice in attempts to equilibrate the gradient. This causes the potato to lose mass as it is essentially \u201cdrying out.\u201d However, there is a point in which so much water will leave the potato cells that there will actually be more solute in the cells than the solution (solution will become hypotonic). Because of this, water will begin to rush back into the potato cells, giving back some mass (rehydrating).",

But since you only have three samples in each group, if one sample is drastically different (such as with piece two) than the others for some reason, it could bias your results more..in other words, this could be because of statistical errors",

All the potatoes were in hypertonic solutions ( solutions with more solute than the potato) so the water inside the potato was at a higher concentration so water went out of the potato (osmosis - water high to low) causing a -% change in mass for the potato.",

Often (as is the case here), your question can be at least partially answered by simply looking at the words themselves and understanding their roots.",

They fuse with secretory vesicles that invaginates into the cell (endocytosis), and breaks down the contents in the vesicle, such as foreign objects or bacteria. One very common example is your phagocytes - they ingest bacteria/viruses/foreign particles, and the enzymes in the lysosomes then break them down.\n\nPeroxisomes, on the other hand, breaks down fatty acids and amino acids. Breaking down of fatty acids and amino acids also produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is toxic to cells, and thus the peroxisome\u2019s job is to break it down as well (which gives it its name too)",

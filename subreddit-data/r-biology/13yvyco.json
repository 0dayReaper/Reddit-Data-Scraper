Water moccasins shouldn't be able to survive in northern PA; northern Virginia, and maybe there could be one spotted in the very southernmost bit of PA, but as far as I know, there isn't a stable population anywhere in PA.  https://www.poconorecord.com/story/sports/2010/05/09/killing-myth-cottonmouths-can-t/51611604007/",

If you happen to have taken any pictures or have any confirmation of the snakes you saw being water moccasins, you should definitely let the state extension in that area know.  As it stands, there's no official moccasin presence in NY, but any new confirmed sitings could change the known range.\n\nHere's the moccasin range from wikipedia - even southern PA is a stretch from the official range:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agkistrodon_piscivorus#/media/File:Geographic_distribution_of_the_two_species_of_cottonmouth,_Agkistrodon_piscivorus_and_Agkistrodon_conanti.jpg\n\nDoesn't mean it isn't possible, but from [life in the finger lakes](https://www.lifeinthefingerlakes.com/finger-lakes-snakes/): \"Of all the snakes in the region it\u2019s the water snake that is the most wrongly feared. They\u2019re often mistaken for the venomous cottonmouth, a species that doesn\u2019t occur in New York. \"",

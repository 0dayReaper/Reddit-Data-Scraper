As much as I want to be funny and redditous about this, actually yes, there was allegedly one at the zoo in Sukhumi, in the 60s.\n\nGeladas and all sorts of baboons interbreed viably all the time and baboon-mandrill hybrids are sometimes viable. There's record of a viable captive-bred macaquedrill and mandrill-hamadryas. In the wild (\"the wild\" here means \"a specific region in the 522 km between Djibouti City and Addis Ababa\") there are hamadryas and olive baboons who happily hybridize, and there's geladas hanging around nearby who sometimes get in on it. These geladas don't seem to tend to like mandrills that way, apparently, but since mandrill x baboon is doable and the ranges overlap, (mandrill x baboon hybrid) x gelada is within the realm of plausiblility.\n\n Those populations probably have some crazy genetic stuff going on, which I should stress is normal and expected :) \n\nRuffs have like five somatomorphs and defined sex roles, which we think is because someone had sex with a grouse or grouse-somebody else hybrid somewhere. We have genital herpes as a species because one of our Homo rudolfensis ancestors fucked nasty with a sick, uh... Australopithecus, I think, the source I learned this from called it a Paranthropus but that's contested as a thing now. The gelaboondrill averagebeast of the far future will be participating in a grand tradition, lol.",

    "postText": "Hii. I'm a biology student and I was wondering if there were any tips for learning the classification of animals and plants a bit more easily/quickly, or is plain old memorization the only way. I need to learn the classification of chordates and plants for the upcoming exams and I feel a bit overwhelmed. So if you have any tips, please feel free to share.\nThanks in advance!",

However this pattern is not universal, but it can serve as a memory aid or at least help you work out what level a name might belong to. Wikipedia has a useful section for it on the page for [Taxonomic Rank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank)",

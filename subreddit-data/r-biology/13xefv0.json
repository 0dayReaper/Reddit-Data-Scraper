They get thirsty and have adapted to expect a certain level of surface tension to keep themselves from drowning while drinking from natural water sources - a lot of drinks have different surface tensions and thus will trap the moth and drown it when it lands.\n\n2. They mistake the reflections on the surface of the drink in low light conditions for an actual light source and end up in the drink and drown.",

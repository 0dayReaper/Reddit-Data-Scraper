I am totally open to getting a masters or PhD so if your job recommendation requires those please still include them! Thanks for any help!",

            "comment": "1) if you're looking for high-paying jobs you should have studied business or law, not biology. \n\n2) you can look for a job in a big pharma company and work your way up the ladder. Eventually you can such routes as consultant or project manager. \n\n3) But with just a bachelor's it's gonna be difficult because at that point you're not skilled at business and neither science. I recommend getting a masters in biology or an MBA to sharpen your skill set.",

But any Master\u2019s degree is a minimum. OP, as example, I have an MsC in Biology, work in a mid-tier Medical Affairs position (with no ambition to move beyond that) and make enough to make ends meet and a bit more without financial worries.",

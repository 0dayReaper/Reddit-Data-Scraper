            "comment": "I got my PhD in pharmacology and physiology. But my mentor said we were really doing mostly biochemistry experiments, which she was correct about. I never did a whole lot of molecular or cell bio but I can\u2019t imagine the math requirements would be much different.\n\nMost of the math we did was done by computers. Basically we would punch in our numbers and the computer would do graphs, calculate an ED50 or whatever else we needed for results. The thing was more knowing which statistical test to use in a particular situation.\n\nThey talked about us taking a stats course, but that never materialized. I kind of wish I had though as I still feel a bit weak on statistics. It is nice to know the theory behind the math both for stats and for just basic things like knowing what a sigmoid curve looks like and what it means. But actual nitty gritty computation was all done by computers during my PhD work.",

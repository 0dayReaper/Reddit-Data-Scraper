And I do feel bad. It made me wonder, and this question came to mind: Are humans the only organism that kills other things simply out of annoyance/dislike? I tried to search it but found no results. \n\n\nAny behaviouralist out there that might know the answer to this question?",

Playing is for learning hunting, survival, mating or social behaviours.\n           \nWhen considering a playful behaviour, you have to consider its educational purpose first. And if you find none, then you can start considering fun is the goal. Like dolphins doing air rings under water, or a chimp harassing a bug. And even there, you can't be certain there is no other goal than having fun. It just becomes a plausible explanation.",

This can occur due to territorial disputes, resource competition, or defense of their offspring. For example, some primates may engage in lethal aggression against individuals from rival groups. However, it's essential to consider that humans, with their advanced cognitive abilities and cultural influences, may exhibit a wider range of motivations for killing other organisms, including personal preferences and cultural beliefs.",

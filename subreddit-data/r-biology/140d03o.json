If you have a scientific taxonomy of what you\u2019re thinking of, that would help.\n\nI agree with the comment above that at least the most visible animals in this picture look like Collembola species like this one: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c1/d5/bd/c1d5bdedc63c3cbac97cc6a6638b7caf.jpg \n\nCollembola can vary a lot in color, so I wouldn\u2019t use that as a distinguishing characteristic.\n\nEdited to add: I also wouldn\u2019t think these are actually the things biting, but would be curious to hear more from OP or see video.",

I once let some spittle bugs onto my finger and got bit multiple times. They seemed to mistake my finger for a plant. They\u2019d crawl a bit, stop, adjust their proboscis, and I\u2019d feel a very slight painful itch, so I\u2019d nudge them away from that area. I\u2019m wondering if perhaps smaller bugs might have limited ability to distinguish food sources.",

They typically are grayish, but more reddish when filled with blood. Wings of many species, including some that feed on humans, contain dark patterns, which give them a grayish appearance.",

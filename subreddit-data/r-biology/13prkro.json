For instance, when people have rampant ants tunneling beneath their driveways year after year, the continued displacement of dirt will cause cracking of the driveway. After enough cracking occurs, the owner will replace the driveway. The materials used to replace the driveway will produce emense amounts of co2. The same can be said of the home in terms of carpenter ants, waps, silverfish, etc. Thus leading to faster degradation of the home. Following this comes an inevitable teardown and replacement. So then, more habit is destroyed, which is far more detrimental to wildlife than home care.",

Removing pests that damage the structural components of our homes means fewer repairs and rebuilds over time. A 2500 square foot home requires 80-130 trees. Removing ants and other home damaging insects from the property will reduce overall environmental destruction. Believe it or not, there are eco-friendly methods of treating a home.",

Others are food sources, themselves, and serve as vital links in the food chain, as many predators can be quite specialized; while even the more generalist species may be reliant on them for food, as the populations of their other prey insects decline due to anthropogenic activity.\n\nWhile I do have some major issues with the study on which this article is based, it's authors are, nevertheless, trying to argue that even the brown marmorated stink bug can have certain benefits within the ecosystems it has invaded.\n\nhttps://entomologytoday.org/2013/07/15/stink-bugs-may-be-good-for-something-after-all/\n\nIt concludes with this (penultimate) line:\n\n**\"This study shows how truly complex ecosystems can be, and how even damaging invasive species like the BMSB can be beneficial to useful pollinators or insects that attack other insects such as wasps.\"**",

Arachnids (which is what ticks are), on the other hand, have four pairs of legs (except as larvae) and no antennae whatsoever. \n\nWhile the organism pictured here has four pairs of appendages, its first pair, which emerge from its head instead of its thorax and have a very different morphology than the other three, are antennae and not legs. As such, one can safely assume that we aren't dealing with an arachnid of any kind and that this is, in fact, an insect.",

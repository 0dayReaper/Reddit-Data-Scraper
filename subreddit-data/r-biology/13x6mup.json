    "postText": "This is for field biologists/ those that work physically labor-intensive jobs outside. I\u2019m working 7 days a week doing assorted manual labour outside, 4 of which are centred around restoring wetlands. The weather is getting hot out here and I was wondering if any of you knew of a good hard shell hydration pack that I can put Gatorade in that\u2019s really easy to clean. I\u2019m regularly having to excuse myself due to overheating. Despite drinking gallons of water, a quarter bottle of gatorade hydrates me more than anything. I don\u2019t have the stamina my other colleagues have, it\u2019s embarrassing to not be able to contribute as much as I\u2019d like. I want to not have to excuse myself and grab my water bottle every 5 minutes (I\u2019m often unable to just carry it with me as my hands are full). I\u2019d rather hydrate while engaging in said labour to prolong the periods between having to go some place to cool off. So, if any of you know of anything, even some sort of long straw that can screw on to a gallon jug I can throw in a backpack, let me know. I\u2019d be extremely grateful! Thank you all!",

If you\u2019re dead serious about a quarter bottle of Gatorade doing more for ya than gallons of water, you might be overdoing it on the water   \n  \nThat said, I just used a hydration bladder when I was doing precommercial thinning for weeks and weeks",

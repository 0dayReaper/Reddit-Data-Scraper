            "comment": "Your body is adapting its temperature to the need, elevating it means getting optimal conditions for bacteria and virus killing. What you're feeling when you get shivers it's you temperature going up, meanwhile your body is measuring the difference between the external temperature and yours. Since yours is changing and the external is the same, you feel as it is 'colder'. Same thing happens but inverted when you feel hot. You're just warming up the sheets. :\u00b6",

Of course it's not a computer but I'm making it very simple. The hypothalamus has two ways to analyze the temperature of the body, one trough the periferical nervous signals and one trough blood itself. When we get an infection the immunitary system tells the hypothalamus, via endogenous pyrogens, hey wake up bitch raise the temperature. \nAnd so it does it in two ways:\n\n1- shivers, basically involuntary muscle spasms to produce more heat without movement. It's the signal you feel when that happens.\n\n2- vasoconstriction, your body reduces the surface in the periferal areas of you body by sending less blood to those regions so that you don't exchange as much heat as you would with the external ambient.\n\nConcluding, you feel cold cause you are not at the right temperature the hypothalamus is telling you to be, and so all those things are functional but also are telling you stop your ass and rest. \n\nNo sweat no other things, but maybe when you get acquainted also those make you feel different. But the main cause is this. :)",

There are some simple tests that he can take, they do things like have him draw a clock that says \u201c2:45\u201d, give him three words at the beginning, ask him to remember them, then ask again at the end. Keeping him active is important- use it or lose it. Aricept and Namenda are two of the most common drugs, they help slow cognitive loss, but not stop it. You really need to have him evaluated!",

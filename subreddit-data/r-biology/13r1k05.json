            "comment": "Bodybuilders in competition typically have 3-4% body fat. Even between competitions, they\u2019re body fat never gets very high. A normal BMI (let\u2019s just say 25 for arguments sake) individual who is 5\u201910 would weigh about 175lbs. At 4% body fat, they would have 7lbs of fat on them, with the rest being useful tissue. \n\nA body builder at the same height would weigh between 210lbs and 275lbs, depending on their physique according to a quick google search. Let\u2019s assume 235lbs as a good middle of the road number. That gives them a BMI of 33.7. That\u2019s higher than the other guy because BMI only cares about direct weight, not muscle mass. At 235lbs and 4% body fat, that guy has about 9 pounds of fat. Not much difference. \n\nNow to your question. You mention a desert island. Do we have a source of fresh water? If not, the answer is simple. The difference will be so minimal as to not matter. Regardless of which guy you\u2019re talking about, they\u2019ll each have roughly 3 days. The winner will be whoever sweats the least and conserves energy. \n\nIf food is your main concern, the bodybuilder will last longer. There\u2019s simply more of him to burn. Even if the first 60 pounds (9 pounds of fat first, then 51 pounds of muscle) burns at a higher rate, then he\u2019ll just be where the first guy started. Losing 60lbs due to starvation would take 1 to 2 months by the way. The other guy would still be losing weight that whole time. \n\nThe math changes drastically if instead of the same body fat percentage, they were the same BMI. Either way, you weigh 235lbs. The average male in the US is 21% fat. So a 235lbs guy with 21% body fat would have 49lbs of fat. He\u2019d also have a BMR of 2189 cal/day based on the Katch McArdle model assuming he was 25 years old. The actual age is irrelevant because we are going to keep it as a constant. Based on the same model and age the body builder would have a BMR of 2,580 calories. In other words, the body builder should lose weight roughly ~20% faster.",

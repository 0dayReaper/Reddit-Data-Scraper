            "comment": "In the simplest possible words:\n\nSo, the mammallian immune system is *really really* complicated. Imagine it like this:\n\nThe immune system produces proteins called \"antibodies\". Each antibody can only bind with *one very specific* thing. If something looks even slightly different on a chemical level, it doesn't work. If it does work, it allows the immune system to knock out whatever the antibody binds with. It's like a code that tells the immune system \"fight this!\"\n\nHowever, the immune system does not know what it might encounter in the future. Some new virus or bacterium might come along and then it will need an antibody against that to work. But antibodies have to be made ahead of time.\n\nSo what the body does is produce huge amounts of different antibodies. If we're going back to codes, it's just going down the list and producing them against *everything.* There's some testing involved so the body doesn't produce antibodies against itself, but ideally, the idea is that whenever something potentially hostile comes along, the immune system has an antibody that fits, because it has thousands of them against many potential threats. Sometimes, it produces one against something that isn't actually dangerous. Like pollen: It's something foreign that comes into the body, it's recognized by an antibody, it *might* be dangerous. Better ramp up the immune system. \n\nAutoimmune diseases and allergies are the immune system being *too careful* and not really recognizing what is or is not dangerous.",

                    "comment": "Thanks for the detailed explanation! Is there a way to 'correct'/help the immune system with this problem? Most medicines are anti-histamines(at least for pollen allergy). However this doesn't help me and has side effects(fe fatigue). The side effects outweighs the positive effects. I think anti-histamines are a temporary solution and does not really help the immune system in the long run(correct me if I'm wrong). \n\nWould be interested to read/watch if you know anything interesting around this topic.",

The medicine has side effects on me which as far as I know have anti histamine properties. Fe I tried medicines called 'cetrizine' and 'desloratadine'. These have side effects on me and make me sleepy/fatigued. \n\nJust write if you want and when you have time.\n\nGood luck training!",

The stuff they can prescribe is usually a lot more effective than the basic stuff you can get at a drug store.\nThe anti histamines supress the allergic reactions, theres no real downsides to that other than some tiredness like you mention. The tiredness does also get less when you get used to the medication or you can try a different variant, as not everyone responds the same to the different ones. \nDesloratadine was terrible for me. Cetritizine was alright but didnt alleviate symptoms enough. Now I got levocetritizine prescribed and it works amazingly. Still some drowsiness but I just take it in the evening, sleep really well and the mornings it doesnt bother me anymore",

            "comment": "Tl;dr Some parts are excreted and some parts are recycled.\n\nBlood is composed of **blood plasma** (the liquid containing mostly water, proteins, and other ions and molecules) and **blood cells** (red blood cells, white blood cells, etc.)\n\nThe blood cells are produced by the bone marrow (along with some other organs). The issue of having too many cells in your blood is \"solved\" by the fact that cells break down after some time. And the products are either excreted or recycled to produce new cells. Conditions in which too many cells are produced (e.g. erythrocytosis) do cause blood pressure problems.\n\nBlood plasma isn't really created by any organ. The water part comes from water a person drinks throughout the day. The issue of having too much water is \"solved\" by the urinary tract, i.e. you pee out excess water to avoid high blood pressure. If your kidneys do not work properly, it can lead to high blood pressure (ironically, high blood pressure can also be the cause and not the symptom of kidney problems).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSidenote: The production of blood cells in the bone marrow is in fact regulated. Not necessarily turned completely off, but the rate of production can be modified based on the body's needs. One example of this type of regulation is through the presence of a hormone called erythropoietin which stimulates red blood cell production in the bone marrow. The levels of erythropoietin can change based on the body's need for oxygen. Athletes used to use this hormone as a doping substance to increase the body's ability to carry oxygen and increase endurance. \n\nHope this helps :)",

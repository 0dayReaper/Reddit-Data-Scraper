    "postText": "Here I am eating a sandwich when it suddenly occurred to me that it makes no sense for lettuce leaves to be all wrapped up in a ball. All those buried leaves can't get any sun for photosynthesis, it's not like a seed with a hard shell to protect the insides, it's just leaves all the way down. So what gives?",

Do you recognize the pattern you see if you cut an iceberg lettuce in half? \n\nAs you may know, new young leaves are soft and tender and grow close to each other to protect their tenderness. \n\nWe, human, love those tender leaves from the center of the plant. But there is few at a time... so, when some of our salad or even kale showed mutation resulting in hypertrophy of the apical meristem like here we were VERY happy. So happy we proceeded to select them and make them reproduce to.achieve as much tender leaves as possible. \n\nWe actually did the same with flower meristem, you can observe it in cauliflower.\n\nIt is indeed not ideal at all for the plant but plants selected by humans don't have to worry about efficiency as we water and feed them daily and make sure they have no competitors.",

    "postText": "I know there should be a registry for all recognized animal species so that people can determine when new species have been discovered, and research has led me to the ICZN\u2019s (International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature) ZooBank, but I haven\u2019t figured out how to access it for browsing purposes.\n\nWhat I want is the ability to browse and search through a site or database containing all officially-recognized species with pictures and up-to-date names at least, rather than limiting my sources to those that might become outdated, incomplete (as far as listed species go) or bound by location-specific information. I also think someone discovered a potentially new species a few years ago and want to check its status, but I haven\u2019t found any other mention of it online.",

Sadly it doesn't contain pictures but if you have a scientific name you can try a Google image search from there.\n\nAs far as checking into a specific new species, if you know the proposed name for it, or at least the Genus, you can try using [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) to find the paper describing the new species. This will exist if the species was indeed determined to be new. Since its from only a few years ago you should be able to limit your search to that timeframe.\n\nAlso keep in mind it can take several years for the scientists who found a species to confirm it is in fact new and now just a colour variant or weird mutant of a know species (then to get the paper written, reviewed and published).",

            "comment": "Lol good luck! That sure would be nice. There are some good websites out there but none could possibly be complete. Names also change all the time due to taxonomic revisions. The ITIS website is pretty good but not often updated. The tree of life project is neat for higher order groups. Discover life is good for some groups. I studied moths, and moth photographers group website is incredibly detailed and up to date for North America. I'm sure there are great websites for other specialties too. New species are being described every day, especially insects.",

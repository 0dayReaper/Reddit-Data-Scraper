Enough for two of the exams I have to take to be able to apply for med school. My focus is on biology and chemistry. My chemistry isn't that bad. I want to learn both in a year and make the other 2 exams which are required to apply for med school. The other parts are as good as done to be able apply",

Whether you can pass the exam will depend on how deep they expect you to know each topic. For example, metabolism alone was a 5 month biochem course which I wouldn't have understood without a year of organic chemistry and the prerequisite biochem I before it.\n\nI doubt they will go into that level of detail but you can see how complex every topic can be.\n\nIf they just cover the \"bullet points\", the main ideas, of each topic, then yes I think you can learn enough to get by.",

Bio 1 is a prerequisite for bio 2 but I have heard of students stacking them. You\u2019d need permission for this. The bigger issue is that premed programs require more biology than just basic bio one and two. We have to take several upper level biology classes, too. I can\u2019t imagine a scenario where you could complete all of the biology required for premed in one year (and chem, too).",

The course is called geneeskunde(which translates to med school) fe at Erasmus University which consist of 3 year bachelor, 3 year master and after this specialization.\nI'm trying to enter the bachelor. That's med school right?",

Evolution, ecology, physiology, some cell biology, etc. It required no prior understanding. I also took general chemistry 1 and 2 during this time. I therefore left my first year with a basic understanding of biology and a fundamental understanding of how the small molecules of life work.\n\nAfter that however, I took a dedicated cellular biology class and organic chemistry at the same time. That is, I learned to apply my understanding of the basic sciences to actual biological systems. I learned to make predictions and test my hypotheses.\n\nFrom here it got more detailed and more complex until I graduated.\n\nThe point I'm making is that you probably COULD do it... But doing it step-by-step is going to help you in the long run.",

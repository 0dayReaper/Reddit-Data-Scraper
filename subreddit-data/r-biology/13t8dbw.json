What???\n\nDoes anybody know what argument they were appealing to or what new line of thinking I might be unaware of? I was so confused. I told them no I believe selective pressure acting on these mutations drives evolution",

In most populations, organisms with many different genetic variations survive, reproduce, and leave offspring carrying their genes in the next generation. It is not simply the one or two \u201cbest\u201d individuals in the population that pass their genes on to the next generation. This is apparent in the populations around us: for example, a plant may not have the genes to flourish in a drought, or a predator may not be quite fast enough to catch her prey every time she is hungry. These individuals may not be the \u201cfittest\u201d in the population, but they are \u201cfit enough\u201d to reproduce and pass their genes on to the next generation.

He\u2019s theory of evolution came before Darwin\u2019s theory and is based on our cells working together and adapting instead of Darwin\u2019s theory that focuses more on random mutations that are necessary for survival. The Biology of Belief by Bruce Lipton is an interesting read and will give you more insight on what I think the students were trying to explain.",

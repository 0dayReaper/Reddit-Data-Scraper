The harvester caterpillar actively hunts and consumes them.\n\nWasp Moth Caterpillar: The caterpillar of the wasp moth is also carnivorous. It preys on other insects, such as grasshoppers and beetles. The caterpillar injects its prey with venom to immobilize it before consuming it.\n\nAnd of course, there's the [large blue butterfly](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18439-zoologger-the-very-hungry-caterpillar-usurps-a-queen/) that you simply need to read about.",

    "postText": "I'm in Bio I, so maybe the problem is I'm working with a simplified model, but how I understand it is oxygen is produced from water in PSII. Most of C4 plants' happens in PSI, so do they just produce little to no oxygen, or is  there another step or change that allows them to produce more?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "C4 plants have a adaptation where the carbon is fixed in the vascular sheith, as to limit the amount of oxygen exposure to Rubisco (because it is a pussy enzyme)\nThe amount of oxygen that it produces in PSII is the same as C3 plants, as it needs the same amount of products from the light cycle\nI\u2019m guessing the confusion arises from not separating the light and dark cycles, the light cycle is nearly the same in al plants",

                    "comment": "I think the confusion comes from the book describing the photosynthesis that happens in the bundle-sheaths as using cyclic electron flow using only PSI. From the book:\n\n\"To generate this extra ATP, bundle-sheath cells carry out cyclic electron flow, the process described earlier in this chapter. In fact,these cells contain PS I but no PS II, so cyclic electron flow is their only photosynthetic mode of generating ATP.\"\n\nAlso, about cyclic electron flow:\n\n\"There is no production of NADPH and no release of oxygen that results from this process. On the other hand, cyclic flow does generate ATP.\"\n\nSo does a large amount of photosynthesis occur outside of the bundle-sheaths? The book made it seem like the vast majority occurs in the bundle-sheaths.",

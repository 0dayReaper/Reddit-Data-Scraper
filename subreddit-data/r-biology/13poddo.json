I would also mist it, or at least place rocks on top of the mulch, so when you water the plant the water on the rocks evaporates in the heat of the day, simulating humidity. My town typically stays at 95-105F in the summer and is humid AF, and porterweed does great here. I have seen it in full sun and in partial shade against houses. It is a fast grower, gets HUGE, and is an annual in most places. It is cool growing in shitty soil conditions.",

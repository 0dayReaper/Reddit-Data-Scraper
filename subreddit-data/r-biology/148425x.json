Either is fine, but they are different, so be clear.\n\nThere may be some good data for farm animals, but that is not 'natural'.\n\nThere is interest in ranges changing with climate change, eg, some things moving north. That might lead to some ideas.",

They might be able to help you with a comparative dataset, but be prepared to be very specific about your needs.",

Down to the species can be trickier though- E. Huxleyi probably has the best chance. \nI\u2019ll bet some species of trees and grass are also pretty well defined.",

The ENT I work for says that tinnitus is your brain\u2019s way of \u201cfilling in the gaps\u201d of the frequencies you\u2019re missing. And most hearing loss starts in the higher frequencies. Hearing aids can sometimes help with it if it\u2019s extreme.",

The authors just declare them \"hair-cell like\" based on expression of a couple of key genes and similarity to the patterns of genes expressed by real hair cells.\n\n* The quality of the images is at times very poor with oversaturated signal (flat blobs of colour on the images). This does not give me confidence in the quality of the data\n\n* There is no test that the mice regain any hearing. This can be done with a simple test that any hearing lab working on mice usually is capable of (auditory brainstem response). The omission of this test which was almost certainly performed in the context of this study is really suspicious to me\n\nA lot of people in the thread are concerned about Tinnitus. The therapy here would only apply to hearing loss caused by loss/death of hair cells in the cochlea. As far as I understand it, Tinnitus is usually an issue that commonly arises from issues in processing the auditory information in the brain.",

There's protocols out there that they can use to see if the brainstem is receiving sound information. \n\nThe headline seems a bit optimistic without that data.",

    "postText": "Not sure if this is allowed - I would post on r/labrats but that's not an option today. Please help if you can! I am plating HEK293T cells for transfection on 6-well plates, but they keep clumping around the edges and eventually floating. I also put some cells in our normal 100mm dishes, and those spread evenly and look normal. Not sure what the problem could be since I took the cells from the same plate, mixed them thoroughly, and observed a single cell suspension before incubating. I'm using DMEM with 10% FBS. Attached pictures for reference - is it possible that the cell density is too high in the 6 well plates? I'm using 1 mL for adhering and adding 1 mL of media afterwards (following my transfection protocol). Hope someone can help :)\n\n[100 mm dish](https://preview.redd.it/tt0y9l8nem5b1.jpg?width=2084&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=14034e05798ba19aeecaae0579c34dad49aa64af)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[6-well plate](https://preview.redd.it/hwxx7htpem5b1.jpg?width=2084&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2aceba4af8c696fbde25afffcfba34e7da2ed2fd)",

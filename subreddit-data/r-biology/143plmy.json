    "postText": "So there was a bird that made a nest in an old terrarium of mine outside. My family has been happily watching them grow and progress. However, today, I was outside watering plants when a hawk swooped down and snatched the momma bird right out of the air.\n\nNow there\u2019s 4 hungry babies crying every time I walk past. It\u2019s been several hours and the mom has not returned, so I doubt it was some other bird.\n\nThere\u2019s no wildlife rehab place within over 2 hours from me. And animal control here is useless.\n\nWe have many bird feeders that we feed birds with, including live mealworms when the native bluebird species makes nests in our bluebird houses. So I have lots of mealworms.\n\nWhat can I do? Can I hand feed them myself? Is it a lost cause?",

I hope you feel your work has been successful in as many regards as possible, and I hope it has a lasting effect.

            "comment": "1) Some people have argued on the basis of some series of fossils (tetrapods in particular) that the number of species tends to increase over time, with extinction events being only minor setbacks. This is incredibly flimsy, and you are right to be skeptical. There's 500 different bias, and I'd say anyone who tries to make that claim is massively overreaching.\n\n2) chromosomes are indeed different separate molecules, if you consider a molecule as atoms joined by covalent bounds (although in that case one chromosome is two molecules, one for each strand). On the other hand they are tethered non-covalently by a ton of different proteins, although they tend to occupy different \"territories\" (technical term) in the nucleus. That is, if you color them, [the colors form little distinct blotches.](https://jilldowenlab.web.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/10744/2016/01/PLoSBiol3.5.Fig1bNucleus46Chromosomes.jpg)\n\nIf you wanna get technical each chromosome is generally more than two molecules, cause it's kinda frequent that some breaks need to be made (or happen on their own). It's kind of constantly cut open and reassembled.",

I'd figure something like molluscs or diatoms might be a better metric. Thanks for confirming the skepticism.\n\n2) \"if you consider a molecule as atoms joined by covalent bounds\" Thank you! Yes, this is what I was asking about.",

I don't find it particularly convincing, and based on flimsy data. It seems to me like the bias of someone who worked on tetrapod fossils for a long time. I mean, today some will argue that the number of bacteria species is grossly underestimated, same for funghi. We tend to cluster animals into distinct groups more easily, hence more species there.\n\nFor chromosomes, maybe you'll be interested to know that some enzymes make cuts frequently in DNA. Sometimes coiling needs to be resolved and topoisomerases straight up cut the strand open, uncoils the DNA and sticks it back together. There are also some genes where all the machinery to read them is loaded into place, but is only released after a cut. So you frequently have more than 23 chromosomes \u00d7 2 chr per pair \u00d7 2 strands per chr = 92 molecules of DNA, technically speaking.",

We can't be sure about knowing all the species alive on the earth today, so there is really no way to be surely knowledgeable about all that once existed. Someone might present an educated basis for the statement, but without any evidence,  it's just a hypothesis.\n\n2) There are 2 types of codes on the DNA. One is a meaningful genetic code that is like a mastercopy for everything in your body. Other is like a packaging material. This code is meaningless, so it doesn't hold information and instructions, but it helps to separate 2 chromosomes so their code doesn't get mixed up.\n\nWhen it's extended, it is a double helix (the popular helix thing). But normally, it's supercompressed. Its shape isn't fixed as it changes with cell activities, but you can imagine it to be a long thread coiled to a small ball.",

It seems completely illogical to me that scientific-industrial complexes like the Chad Mirkin research group will have thirteen quadrillion dollars when a clever, upstart biochemist struggles to get funding for run-of-the-mill QIAGEN stuff.\n\nI read a paper by an Italian economist, a while back, that strongly suggested that providing more or less equal funding to everyone would lead to more important discoveries and developments, given that the five newly-minted researcher kids are probably more than 20% as talented and clever as the one oldly-minted researcher grandpa like Mirkin.",

In all honesty I was quite relieved when I was diagnosed as we couldn\u2019t figure out what the cause of the persistent lethargy and other weird symptoms was. \n\nThe reality was tough, I don\u2019t mind the shots fortunately but I did become quite obsessed with my diet, carb counting and poking holes in my fingers (up to 50 times a day!!!), I had to take a step back in May asking myself whether I\u2019m giving up my mental health by being so obsessed. Since then I\u2019ve found a relatively happy medium and my numbers are fine since. Have bad days but I ride those out, the type one diabetic subs on Reddit helped me tremendously. I recommend them to any newly diagnosed individual as it is a supportive group of people and we need that as type one isn\u2019t well understood in general.\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t answer your question ito Covid itself, I was mostly asymptomatic against the known symptoms of that time (coughing etc) and my lungs was perfectly fine, I presented dreadful laryngitis which lasted two solid weeks, tummy issues and extreme lethargy and exhaustion. I\u2019m in South Africa and this was just as our new variant popped up.",

Inflammation can occur in antigen-dependent or independent ways.\n\n&gt;Little evidence because of lack of funding for research.\n\nUnfortunately the entire scientific profession is astronomically underfunded.  It's one of the most competitive industries for this reason. That said, with or without money, there is still limited evidence to support the hypothesis that pathogenic infections lead to autoimmunity, or a break in tolerance. I'm not saying its impossible, or even unlikely, but that the evidence just isn't there yet. The closest mechanism we've established is molecular mimicry, in which chunks of host proteins fuse (maybe during infection) and generate a foreign (neopeptide) that the body has never seen, giving an avenue for a break in tolerance.  Cells that make these neopeptides are then chronically targeted by the immune system and killed, leading to destruction of self.\n\nAnd yes, I would absolutely tell the lay community afflicted with autoimmune diseases that there isn't a mechanism established yet to support the hypothesis that infectious agents *cause* autoimmunity, because its important to be 100% honest and transparent about our discoveries.",

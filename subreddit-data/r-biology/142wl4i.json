            "comment": "That\u2019s a pretty broad topic. Typically, molecular biology refers to the study of any molecule used by cells. The big ones are DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites, but can include a whole lot of other molecules too. Molecular analyses are used to describe what is happening within the cells of an organism and how those molecules are used to carry out a specific function.  \n\nIf you\u2019d like some help, feel free to DM me!",

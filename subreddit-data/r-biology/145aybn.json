My previous degrees are in Art, English, and teaching English (MAT). I\u2019ve had various jobs, including teaching English. I\u2019m currently working in a Registrar\u2019s office. I want to get a BS in Biology while I\u2019m working here. Quite the 180, I know. \n\nI\u2019m hoping I could eventually do environmental consulting, science writing, or maybe even follow up a BS with a program to become a MLS. I\u2019ve been learning about chemistry &amp; ecology as a hobby lately (I\u2019m on the spectrum and enjoy nerding out for fun.)\n\nHas anyone switched to the sciences later in life? (I\u2019m 41.) How did it go? What did you end up doing?",

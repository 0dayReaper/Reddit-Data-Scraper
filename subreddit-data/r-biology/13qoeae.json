If any of you have watched the episode of love death and robots called Swarm, I'm basically wondering if it is possible for a colonial organism made up of species of mutated parasites and a host would be possible. Asking cause I'm trying to build an elder god for my D&amp;D campaign, and I'm wondering if a hive mind/colonial organism of parasites is possible. I know the D&amp;D part is unscientific, but I like to try and root my monsters at least somewhat on science and reality. After all, something that is possible is more terrifying than something that's not",

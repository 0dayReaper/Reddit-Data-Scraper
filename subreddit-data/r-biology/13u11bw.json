I mean, I generally like them all but with a mantis dying I always feel extra sad idk why. they seem so\u2026aware?

Removing the parasite quickly ruins the delicate balance they had reached. There\u2019s now a massive cavity in the abdomen and internal organs are  unsecured and likely damaged. Mantises also have an open circulatory system meaning they just wash blood over the organs instead of being delivered by vessels. With that much space and a complete loss of abdominal pressure there\u2019s no way the mantis would be able to oxygenate its organs well enough to survive.",

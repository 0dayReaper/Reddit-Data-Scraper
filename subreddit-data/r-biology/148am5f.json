    "postText": "I\u2019m from Germany and Biologists have one of the highest unemployment rates of all academic professions here. Even my professors used to tell me \u201cBiology is probably the only field where you get your doctorate just to still end up as a taxi driver\u201d. And I indeed know multiple people with master degrees/doctorates in Biology, some of them 40+ and never got a biology related job. There\u2019s multiple factors causing this, but one of them is the high concurrence due to biology still being one of the most popular fields of study here. I was wondering if this is different in other places around the world. Is it that tough for biologists everywhere? Which countries do you think offer the best work opportunities for young biologists?",

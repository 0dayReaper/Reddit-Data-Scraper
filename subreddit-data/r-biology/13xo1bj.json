I was under the impression that piebaldism is a form of partial leucism...\n\nFrom the [leucism wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucism):\n\n&gt;More common than a complete absence of pigment cells is localized or incomplete hypopigmentation, resulting in irregular patches of white on an animal that otherwise has normal coloring and patterning. This partial leucism is known as a \"pied\" or \"piebald\" effect",

It\u2019s usually right at the front, where the widows peak would be (the forelock).  Rogue from X-men is a good fictional example.  But it can present in a bunch of different patterns.  I have a patch of white hair on the back of my head which I suspect is piebald.  People can also have it on their bodies, it\u2019s more noticeable in people with darker skin but even us honkeys can have it.  Looks a lot like vitiligo, but different mechanism.  You\u2019re born with it.  Almost any mammal can have it and the gene is dominant.",

It can be genetic, caused by piebaldism or acquired by vitiligo, certain types of moles, viruses or other autoimmune conditions that attack pigment cells.  Vitiligo is a specific type of autoimmune condition that attacks melanocytes, but there are others.  Don\u2019t remember names, autoimmune conditions are usually named something like EuropeanLastName-AsianLastName Syndrome \ud83d\ude02\n\nKowalslki-Yamamoto Syndrome.  I made that up, but it\u2019s Something like that.\n\nHA!  I googled it, the one I was thinking of is called Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Syndrome.  Triple hyphenate, but I was pretty damn close.",

So far in my current lab I have repaired a fluorescent microscope (estimated repair bill $5k) for $0, two $10k refrigerated centrifuges for $6, and two vacuum pumps for $0.5. A little mechanical know how and the confidence to take something apart that\u2019s intimidating can go a long way.\n\nYou would be shocked how cheap and terribly made the inside of a $50k Leica microscope is. Lots of superglue, terrible solders (or wires literally taped to contacts), and lenses that don\u2019t come apart but somehow have dust inside them\u2026",

All of the other \"features\" it also came with where already on the old one they were literally just locked unless you punched in a particular sequence of buttons to unlock them. We ended up just rigging up our own temp sensor and wired it in the same as on the new one had. Cost us $100 and we actually had a better temp sensor set up.",

If course, it doesn't get used but every few months, for this or that, so it was worth every penny I paid, and then some! That compressor, on the other hand, has been replaced twice now. I buy things at harbor freight of I only need it once or twice. Anything more than that is just a bonus, and occasionally, one of their tools will last an enigmatically long time. It's almost creepy, and I wonder what dark magic has possessed them.",

The one I've got now might possibly be possessed, because its been doing great since about 2013--now it's probably going to crap out on me tomorrow, even though I'm not using it.",

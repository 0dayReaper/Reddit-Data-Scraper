From what I read, it\u2019s fairly common for eastern gray squirrels occurring in one of about every 10,000 births.\n\nThis is the same mutation that results in panthers which are just melanistic leopards or jaguars. In their case however, it is far more genetically common, occurring in about one in 10 births (about as common as left handedness is in humans).",

Sometimes the black ones get a big of white in their tail. \n\nNever seen one with a blue tint, though.\n\nIs it the lighting in the photo, or maybe something this squirrel has been eating?  Kind of like the way flamingoes turn pink because of their diet.",

I did find [this ](https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/09/15/mystery-of-the-blue-tailed-squirrels/)link, about some other blue painted squirrels some years ago.\n\nI also thought he may have had some exposure to silver particles depending on where his nest is.  Over-ingestion of silver in certain forms can result in argyria in humans, a condition in which the skin turns greyish-blue.  I couldn't find much about animals or whether fur color would be affected.",

The faces are the transport tissues in a structure called the vascular bundle, The large cells are xylem vessels that move water from the root. And the smaller cells are phloem that transport sugar and sap around.",

It is a common prepped slide you can buy and may be corn (impossible to tell from a slide like this the exact species, I just know the ones we have are corn).\n\nIt is not a root as many here are saying because monocot roots have a central circle of vascular tissue (different from the circle of vascular bundles found in dicot stems).",

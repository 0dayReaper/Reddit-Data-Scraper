    "postText": "Hello! I am a college graduate with a BS in Biology and 2 minors in Chemistry and Earth Science. I have had 5 internships, all related to the fields mentioned above, and I have applied to around 80 places in the last 6 months in hopes of landing a steady job. I haven't heard from ANY ONE. I'm not looking for pity, but rather want to know if any of you have had a similar experience. How long did it take you to find a job after graduating? Any advice?",

            "comment": "I suppose it depends on what you consider to be \"a job.\" I just graduated and haven't even gotten my diploma in the mail yet and I'm already getting a lot of offers and interviews for positions that pay substantially more than what I'm making right now. They definitely don't count as in my field though. For a biology degree, things like quality assurance testing for batches of Coca Cola products and water chemistry analysis aren't exactly things I want to be doing. They're also coming through recruiting agencies, not directly from the employers, and are contract positions for a set period of time that have no benefits (with the possibility of extension, if I want to continue with no benefits and have part of the pay I should be getting going to the agency). Is it a \"job\" in the most technical sense of the word? Yes. Is it anything I would enjoy? Not in the slightest. Does it make full use of my skills? Absolutely not. \n\nI haven't gotten a single call from any of the places I've applied that would be considered to be a career in the field though. I assume my lack of experience is the problem. My guess would be that if I take one of these temporary jobs that will at least have me doing lab-ish things, I'll be better able to get something more desirable after six months to a year. Alternatively, I can stay working where I am now and hold out for a \"good\" job to come along. No clue how long that might take though.",

Medical Lab Science is a decent/good paying field with a lot of job security (because most of our workforce is retirement age and we are becoming chronically understaffed). You usually need ASCP certification, which requires an internship for eligibility. There are a few programs that I know of such as Mayo Clinic labs in Minnesota and Beaumont in Michigan that I believe are designed to cater to those with science degrees (bio, chem, etc) instead of requiring a clinical lab science degree for admission.",

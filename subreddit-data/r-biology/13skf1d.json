    "postText": "I was doing an electrophoresis today and got this really weird result. The gel was 1% agarose, 1st and 10th lanes were ladder and the weird thing at the top is because it slid off the tray and broke a bit before looking at the results, but as I understand it that shouldn't cause smearing like this, right? For context, all samples were cut with restriction enzymes, so we expected clear lines. The slanting of the ladder is also really weird. Any clue where I messed up?",

I would say you made your gel with water instead of the same buffer as the running buffer, but lane 1 should be smeared too.\n\nThe smiling is from uneven heat or electric field distribution, either from unsettled gel or dirty/damaged electrodes.\n\nSmearing is typically a symptom of degradation, but your ladder should not have degraded so...\n\n... did you make your gel with water?",

I think something must've gone wrong with the voltage, but id never seen it happen like this, with one of the ladders kinda working and the other not at all? Very confusing",

The laddder, besides being super smudged, seems fine, so we can rule that out. Some of your samples, on the other hand, look off. Either your samples are bad somehow or you loaded too much of it.\n\nThat is what I can gather from this image and your information anyway.",

Try waiting for the gel to polymerise a bit more, if that doesn't help it's the reagents.\nDepending on your proteins you can lower the gels concistency. It helped me and my coworkers. We used to use 10% gel and switched to 8%.",

This could cause parts of the gel to partially melt (where the current would be strongest), thereby resulting in the smearing. Your ladder is on the periphery, where the gel may have maintained some solidity and therefore given a somewhat more normal result with discrete bands. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb",

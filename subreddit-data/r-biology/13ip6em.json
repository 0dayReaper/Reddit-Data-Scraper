The \"fruit\" of the strawberry is actually those little dots that resemble seeds.\n\nIn this case, it looks like those seeds sprouted on their own for some reason. Each of those \"leaves\" is actually a miniature strawberry plant.\n\nAgain, check with an actual botanist, but I'm pretty sure that's what is going on.",

But I still remember a thing or two.\n\nThe commenter above nailed it. \n\nCan you tell me a bit about the conditions the strawberry plant is growing in? Seeing this expedited reproduction usually means it is stressed or not happy in some way. Could be over crowded, under-watered, low on nutrients, too much or too little sunlight\u2026 \n\nI\u2019m curious since I don\u2019t usually see this so early in May. Usually it\u2019s August or September when we see this. \n\nIt could simply be the result of a missed and unpicked (by you and the birds!) strawberry and some warm weather, or potentially just a plant that is old and past it\u2019s fruit bearing prime.",

Lack of water, low nutrients, over crowding, too much heat\u2026 anything that stresses the plant too much will put it in survival mode and it will focus on quickly producing what is usually a weak little strawberry that often goes unnoticed since it is not a beautiful bright red berry we are used to. They are often small and greenish yellow and the \u201cseeds\u201d that are the actual fruit are tightly packed together. If it\u2019s not picked then we get what OP posted. \n\nOr you know, it could also be a thousand other reasons. Plants are incredibly complex!\n\nFootnote: if any practicing botanist reads this and has corrections, please go for it. I am 10 years out from college and admittedly focused mostly on wild and natural flora to the PNW. Cultivated and domesticated plants are often rule breaking and weird in comparison.",

They produce small kiwis, about the size of grapes and without the fuzzy outer skin!\n\nHoneyberry are very cold Hardy and produce a slightly elongated cube/teardrop berry that looks similar to a blueberry. Flavor is like a tart blueberry or a mix of blueberry and gooseberry. \n\nI also love the Ribes family. Currants grow extremely well here and are native. Red, white, and black currants as well as gooseberries are all great in jams and syrups. Josta berries are a hybrid of a black currant and a gooseberry. I personally love the pink champagne currant, which is a white currant cultivar. There are dozens of variations of red and white currants, all with slightly unique flavor. The berries have large seeds, but each berries is similar to a pomegranate in texture and flesh to seed ratio.\n\nI am also excited for my Flying Dragon Citrus, which is a cold hardy citrus in the orange family. I have seen negative reactions to it due to it being an Orange but extremely sour. Most people are hoping for a sweet citrus. Use it as you would a lemon, and it\u2019s perfectly useful for a fruit that is normally only accessible to grow in tropical climates.",

I hope that my work will be able to break new ground and help us understand better how physical forces can influence biological systems, something that is very relevant to diseases like cancer, where we found that the tumour itself is tougher than its surrounding tissue.",

Physical forces as in exactly what you think it is, being pulled, being stretched, being compressed. Cells experience these forces too, just at a much smaller scale. For example, when cells move inside the tissue in your body, they have to be able to move between other cells or between a meshwork of proteins like collagen, and these are physical obstacles cells need to be able to adapt and overcome. So they will squeeze themselves through these tiny gaps between other cells or between the collagen meshwork, and these squeezing can have a certain effects on the cells themselves, they can elicit certain signaling pathways, certain transcription pathways inside the cells. And in the context of diseases, for example, cancer cell invasion and metastasis or cells moving within a fibrosis tissue like the diseased lungs or liver, these cells have to do exactly the same. So understanding these physical forces is not only important in the normal context but diseases too.\nHope that helps :)",

When GFP clumps together, the local concentration increases, and as an effect, you see these white dots appear :)",

So a lot of endocytosis needs actin polymerisation, naming phagocytosis, macropinocytosis, CME among other processes such as migration. Other actin independent endocytosis should not be affected by cytoD. Without knowing exactly what process or what is your experimental setup, I can only offer a few advices: \n+ Did you use a high enough concentration? Maybe the concentration you use is not high enough for that CME process?\n+ Are you sure the CME process you look at is indeed CME and not other forms of micro-endocytosis such as clathrin-independent, CLIC-GEEG? If your CME marker specific enough for your CME process?",

I did some IF quantification in my infection that suggests yes, but I have a feeling my Salmonella are just sticking to the cells vs being taken up. I used 10 uM, found a few papers that used the same dosage for ex vivo infections. I got a flow experiment next week to confirm it more certainly.\n\nI'm examining interferon signaling, and the literature is a bit murky on endocytic requirements for signaling. Literature suggests CME. I just wanted to pick your brain on it since you seem much more acquainted with endocytic processes than I am.",

And is that what you see? \n\nInterferon is also a bit fuzzy. I suggest you try with transferrin first, which is a more specific and canonical substrate for CME. And use the concentration of CytoD that you want to test and see if it inhibits transferrin endocytosis in your cells. you can get these fluorescence transferrin substrate for the transferrin receptors to label them, then you can fix your cells afterwards to quantify for the effect of inhibition. Then once you found the right concentration, you can try again with Interferon. But keep in mind of other endocytosis too.",

The IF method I used is a bit more novel with cell segmentation and quantification, but in a nutshell I saw decreased fluorescence corresponding to my fluorescent Salmonella in cytoD treated cells, but there were still some present in the z-stacks that was within/juxtaposed to my WGA membrane staining. So the question is are they sticking or truly inside the cells in the more cortical regions. If I had to guess, Salmonella is probably just **very** sticky, adherence is such a critical part of its pathogenesis.\n\nGood suggestion w/ the transferrin! Will consider it if my flow experiment is inconclusive but I'm pretty confident it will give me the answer!",

If you are worry, you can also use pH sensitive fluorescent salmonella next time too. The probe will only fluoresces if they are inside an acidic organelle such as acidified phagosomes/lysosomes, otherwise it will remain dark. That way, you can definitely tell if your bacteria have been ingested or not. \n\nGood luck.",

But cancer cells are always dividing, and each time they accumulate new mutations that some mutations will give them the ability to resist drugs. Also, inside the body, cancer cells don't exist alone but surrounded by other cell types and matrix proteins. The surrounding cell types have been shown to help promote chemotherapy resistant, for example, in melanoma. The dense matrix network can also hinder therapeutic molecules to get, for example, antibody therapy.",

The trick is to know exactly what you want going in to it. If you try to \u201clearn the language\u201d it won\u2019t be worth it. For example, you say you use R for graphs and stats. If it were bar graphs or ANOVA\u2019s etc., those could be much more easily done in PRISM or JMP. But PRISM/JMP can\u2019t do sequencing analysis. Some programs can, but if you have specific questions, often times they don\u2019t have a GUI option. That\u2019s when you learn to do it yourself. This can take hours upon hours. Always have a reason or you will lose yourself. And use ChatGPT. It\u2019s very often wrong, but MUCH more efficient at looking up guides, tutorials, and assembling \u201cstarting point\u201d code. Keep your focus on the end goal, not the language. That\u2019s my advice. Oh, and Sanbomics (Sanbiomics?) on YouTube is THE best teacher for this stuff I\u2019ve ever seen. I don\u2019t have time to watch everything ver what I need, but if you want to become a master, just watch everything he does. Guy\u2019s a real expert.",

So the cell basically collapsed because nothing was holding it from the inside. Inside our body though, cells die because of programme cell death called apoptosis, which you can tell by the characterisitic formation of membrane blebs, which look like bubbles :D",

Actin is the protein that is found in every single cell in your body and losing it will cause your cells to collapse and die. It doesn't bind to a receptor to trigger any kind of reactions you would find in \"being high\". It simply goes directly inside your cell and blocking actin polymerisation. You'll likely be dead \ud83d\udc80 \n\nAnd thank you for watching the video \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70",

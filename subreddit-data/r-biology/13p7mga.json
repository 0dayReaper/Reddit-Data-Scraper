            "comment": "Think of it like this: Energy is required to build biomass. All energy comes from the sun. \n\nThe largest biomass organisms will be the closest to directly getting their energy from the sun (plants, other primary producers). There is almost no energy waste, so they harvest energy from photons and almost all of it goes into biomass. \n\nThe next largest level of biomass feeds directly on these plants. Herbivores. Small mammals, insects etc. If in the ocean this would be like plankton and such.\n\nThe next largest level of biomass would be omnivores that eat this previous trophic level. Larger fish, deer, etc. \n\nThe next level in terms of biomass would be what preys on the previous level. Sharks, bears, etc. \n\nBasically at every trophic increase, there is energy that was taken in that was not directly put into growth (metabolic energy). So necessarily biomass will get smaller as the trophic level increases. By the time you are at an apex predator, the things that you eat have to eat other things, which have to eat other things, which has to eat other things. That is all the same energy that was photosynthesized by the plant, but each organism along the way \"used\" some of it.",

Try mapping wo eats who and assume that energy is lost between each meal. The energy is lost due to energy production and so on and about 10 procent is used for growth. \nAnother thing you can try to imagin is when you eat a sallad, how much is turned into energy and how nuch contribute to your mass :) put yourself on the trophic triangle :)",

There's actually a crazy awesome hypothesis that this is adaptive: nematodes have a resistent stage in the middle of their development, but in order to reach it, they need to eat a small amount of food after hatching but not *too* much, otherwise they'll never enter that stage. So the idea is that the mom senses no food in the environment and sacrifices herself so that her offspring can become super resistent. By eating just enough food to reach that resistent stage. By eating her insides. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParent of the year award right there.",

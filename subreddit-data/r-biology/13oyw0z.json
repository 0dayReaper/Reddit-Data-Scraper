He would yell things at people that might have been in English. One day he pooped behind one of the pillars on the side where people walked. While gross, he was eventually removed and the \u201cmess\u201d cleaned up about a week later, but a stain still remains there to this day. One day when I was walking past it at night, and out of the corner of my eye, it looked like the homeless man\u2019s poop was back! A similarly sized dark mass in the exact same spot! But as I turned my full attention to the dark mass, I saw it was a moth, this moth you see here, though a fair bit darker, on the floor beside a pillar where a homeless man\u2019s poop had been cleaned up days earlier that looked so much like it. Was it attracted to that place for disguise? Was it random chance? Who knows, but it was odd.",

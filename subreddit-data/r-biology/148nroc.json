I grew up an outdoorsy kid but in a place that didn\u2019t normally have them, so when I was 10 miles back on a hike as an adult and one started following me I initially laughed it off\u2014 to the annoyance of my friends who had lived their while lives in \u201chorsefly country\u201d. I even declined repellant spray \n\nThen it bit me, and kept coming back for more even after applying spray. Maybe it was just me but the bites hurt for hours afterward and I couldn\u2019t help but try to avoid every giant flying thing I saw after that. I HATE wasps but I\u2019d have preferred one to the bitey bastard that was following me on that hiking trip\n\nEdit: I saw someone else mention that they hunt you and I will echo that it absolutely felt like she was hunting me for another five or so miles of that hike",

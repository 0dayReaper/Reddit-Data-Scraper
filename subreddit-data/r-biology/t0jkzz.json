When cells move around and extend little blobs like this, actin microfilaments are often constructed to help push the cell membrane in that direction. They build relatively quickly and can branch quite easily.\n\nIt's red because they used a fluorescent tag that is red and/or recolored it red for display purposes. A \"wild\" cell wouldn't have any color at all. Why the motion looks somewhat fire like I'm not sure.",

Cancer cells can produce too much acid, but this is just a byproduct of their metabolism and the body will usually compensate anyway. \n\nIm just reading between the lines here and assuming this question may be inspired by alkaline diet claims.

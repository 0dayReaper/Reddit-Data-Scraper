    "postText": "Hi! My friends and I were on holidays in South Africa, (Wilderness area) on a beach at night. I was looking for some wood for the fire. Then I found what realllly looked like a foot with the shinbone still attached. It was just the skeleton with no meat attached to it (but it wasn\u2019t bleached white) more a brown kind of wood looking color and it did still have some stringy textured stuff on the bones. So obviously I took it back to the campfire. I was pretty sure it was a human foot and leg, but we were a bit drunk and just laughed about it a bit, someone said it\u2019s probably a seal\u2019s flipper and we all agreed and threw it in the fire.\n\nDuring the rest of the night I kept finding things that looked like organs, whilst looking for fire wood, but I wasn\u2019t sure. (objects that were dried up, shriveled, organic, dark brown, odd shaped things that were slightly squishy so not hard like wood)\n\nI showed some of my friends and we all agreed it was disgusting looking, but they didn\u2019t care too much about it. \n\nBut I think we were all chilling on a beach with a washed up corpse littered all over it.\n\nI already looked up a seals flipper and it didn\u2019t look anything like that.\n\nSo I am just curious.. what kind of animals (in South Africa?) are there that could have similar bones to a human foot/shin? Or if there even are any? \nAnd could the things I thought were organs be anything that is native to the ocean? Like seaweed or sea cucumbers or something? \n\nI didn\u2019t take pictures of anything I saw unfortunately :( I hope you can still help me\n\nThanks in advance!",

You could always report your findings to the police and see if they have any reports concerning missing people. I dont think they will charge you for holding back an investigation if you found some and burned them in drunken state.",

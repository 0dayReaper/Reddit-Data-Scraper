The basic idea is that evolution is the correct answer as we understand it, but that isn\u2019t necessarily mutually exclusive with there being a God. The natural laws that govern our world were put into place by the creator, to fit whatever purpose they created the universe for. Some people who believe this believe that the dirty in question guides evolution, while others believe in a more laissez faire approach. \n\nIt obviously clashes with fundamentalist Christianity, as well as creationism. I wish more theists would take this stance, because at least then they wouldn\u2019t be denying science. \n\nUltimately, by definition there is no evidence of the metaphysical in our world that we can use to either prove or disprove the existence (or lack thereof) of a god. It\u2019s a \u201cwe\u2019ll find out if we get there\u201d kind of thing. \n\nGenetic drift is a specific phenomenon (as others have said) but the rest is utter horse shit.",

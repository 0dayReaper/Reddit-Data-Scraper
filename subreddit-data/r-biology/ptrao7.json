But remember they are basically animals that roam their environment in search of food and metabolise whatever they find. \n\nThey don\u2019t reproduce sexually either so beyond exploiting different nutrients or hunting each other there is no big advantage to crowding together rather than spreading out. \n\nAlso on top of the eye of a microscopic organism is kind of a very very specific niche to fill, so there may not even be many other types of bacteria to compete for this specific ecosystem; or even that many nutrients available in the first place. \n\nThere are plenty of bacteria which do form colonies too. \n\nAnd remember, it looks like they are not crowded but again, if you expanded that eye to fill 1cm2 there could be millions and millions of those things on there.\n\nIf you zoomed in far enough you would be able to pass right through a person, or anything else with the amount of space between our molecules.",

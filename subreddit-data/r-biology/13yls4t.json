I was pretty sure we must have something similar for taxonomy. But recently I had a discussion about the newest changes in taxonomy that are not applied in most textbooks yet (namely that Chlorophyta are not considered plants anymore), and I couldn't find \"the most important taxonomy authority\". Probably the most official-looking I could find was NCBI Taxonomy, but their site says \"The NCBI taxonomy database is not an authoritative source for nomenclature or classification\". Apparently when someone decides to shuffle the branches of the tree of life yet again, they just publish a paper, and if it has good argumentation and is cited enough times it becomes consensus in this field.\n\nThe only strict rule of naming I know is that you can't rename a species retroactively, even if you find out there was a mistake. This is why *Homo erectus* is still called like this, even though this species was not actually the first  *Homo* to walk upright as was originally assumed. You may rename higher taxons any way you like though.",

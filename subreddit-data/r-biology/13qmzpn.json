They\u2019re just quietly and sturdily occupying their ecological niche. \n\nHumans also need something to eat; we are easy to kill; and we are destroying our own ecological niches and those of most other organisms. Is that what you mean by \u201cother organisms can\u2019t compete\u201d? \n\nCyanobacteria can photosynthesize and fix nitrogen so they can feed themselves. They are also food. Together with marine algae they produce half the world\u2019s oxygen. They\u2019ve been around for 2.1\u20132.7 billion years, predating plants, so I expect they will survive quite a long time. They aren\u2019t competing with other organisms so much as engineering the biosphere, which makes them the boss, but like I said\u2026 they\u2019re food.",

It is maladaptation, in fact. You put the resources to a wrong thing. You can just about possibly be perfect in relation to a specific stable environment and even then how perfect you are compared to your species-mates? Nothing is perfect.",

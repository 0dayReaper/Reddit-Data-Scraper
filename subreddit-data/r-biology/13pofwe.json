Keep in mind the microtubules are still very active and working during non-mitotic phases because things still need to be transported back and forth between the nucleus and the edge of the cell membrane, and also microtubule helps with moving the cell.\n\nThe moving green comet-like lines might be green fluorescent labeling of [microtubule plus-end tracking proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtubule_plus-end_tracking_protein), which help to rapidly polymerize tubulins into microtubule in the (+) direction, away from the centriole, that's why you see a comet-like concentration of green at the growing tip of those green streaks.",

This is what happens when you have constant additions of GFP-tagged subunits at the ends of microtubules. The new subunits look brighter because the older GFP molecules are getting bleached (if you're unfamiliar with fluorescent microscopy, think of it as the GFP \"running out\" of fluorescence).\n\n Like I wrote, though, it's a guess. It's hard to tell without finding the original publication. If you're interested in this, my suggestion is to try to use some reverse image search tools or just regular old snooping to try and find the paper that this is taken from. It should be much easier than trying to understand what's happening based only on a video.",

If I recall correctly there may be subtle structural changes in the tubulin as well.\n\nHowver, the affinity doesn't drop to zero, it's a lower level of binding, which is why you can still see the length of the MTs and not just the comet at the plus end.",

It gives the signature shooting star kind of looking because the microtubules are growing and the protein only binds to that very end of that growing microtubule, so it looks like that :) Microtubules dont just participate in cell division but many other processes. One of the main functions is to act as a highway for vesicle trafficking (which you can see in one of my videos on my page if interested :) ). And to do this, they need to grow, and motor proteins can walk on them, transporting these vesicles from one side to the other inside the cell.",

But this phase involves two centrioles positioned at extreme ends of the cell, with the microtube spindles radiating towards the center of the cell (equator) where they are pulling the chromosones apart.  \nIt looks like some kind of signal is flowing outward from the visible centriole. The other centriole may be hiding behind the nucleus. But at anaphase the nucleus membrane should be gone. Not sure what is going on here.",

I started with the mitosis assumption because the videos on Pinterest and YouTube were labeled as 'mitosis'. If you look at my first comment you'll see I did comment that it looked more like some kind of cell signaling than mitosis. Cell signaling is actually my main interest.\n\nSo now I can see how the activity in this cell looks like plus-end [tracking proteins](https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(01)00364-6) searching for various targets. The minus-ends seemed to be mostly organized as the centrosome bits. \n\nMicrotubules are amazing mechanisms for accomplishing cellular functions.",

But would you say [this paper](https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(01)00364-6) titled '*Microtubule \u201cPlus-End-Tracking Proteins\u201d'* is using bad terminology when it characterizes *plus-end tracking* as *target search* problem? It seems to make sense to me:\n\n&gt;Microtubules are hollow tubes composed of protofilaments of \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin dimers organized in a head-to-tail fashion. MTs are nucleated from their minus ends, located at microtubule organizing centers, in most cases the centrosome. Like the tentacles of an octopus, the plus ends explore the intracellular space through alternating periods of growth and shrinkage, a behavior which is termed dynamic instability. Through a \u201c**search and capture**\u201d process, the plus ends eventually find their **target destinations**, such as kinetochores on mitotic chromosomes and the cell membrane.",

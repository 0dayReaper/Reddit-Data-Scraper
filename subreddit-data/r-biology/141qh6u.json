    "postText": "I'm actually more interested in learning about genetics and the brain, but I know it's best to start with biology. Is there a good website(s) that I can use as a reference? I'm a Mike Ross when it comes to reading texts when I truly focus on it. I'd also like if there were lab books I can work with.",

            "comment": "I understand the urge to dive right in, but yeah, you need some basics first. These are some good textbooks: \n\nCell biology: the one from Pollard or from Alberts.\nBiochemistry: Voet or Stryer\n\nYou might find free pdf versions online. \n\nNeuroscience is more of a small specific subset that will come easy if you understand the basics. Genetics would merit it's own textbook in this post, but most textbooks are pedagogically outdated and teach prehistoric concepts. It should be covered reasonably well in those textbooks mentioned above though. \n\nOne last comment: understanding biology is not only about knowledge but also about skill. You can learn history by just reading, but you can't learn math by reading without practicing problem solving. Biology is somewhere in between. You can try to solve questions from the biochemistry GRE, those forms are also swimming through the internet somewhere.",

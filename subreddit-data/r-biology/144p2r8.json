Anyways he swore they tasted good but also admitted that me and my brother wouldn't like the taste, which I took to mean they were gross.",

It's sexually transmissible so if you plan on getting a rooster, don't. It's not an Embryo. It's called a lash egg  Lash eggs result from an infection (bacterial or viral) that causes inflammation of a hen's oviduct. That inflammation is referred to as Salpingitis. The hen's immune system reacts to the inflammation by trying to wall-off the infection with a waxy, cheese-like pus. It's basically a pus that was formed into that shape of an egg\n\nI would advise isolating her away from the flock as she could spread it to them through fecal matter. Get her to a vet, or cull her. She is now a risk to your other chickens. And if you cull her, don't eat her. Some people eat the hens they cull, but she could potentially have E. coli, which is nasty if you get it. Isolate her and monitor your other hens for symptoms",

That would mean the egg came first.\n\nHowever, to be pedantic, your description of evolution isn't even close to what actually happened. It may be easier to think of it in terms of languages. If you look at the people of Spain throughout history, it would be impossible to take a single generation and call them definitively the first spanish-speaking generation (as in, everyone before that generation spoke Latin, and everyone after spoke Spanish). Rather, it was a slow process where some words got added, changed, or removed until eventually we have what we now call Spanish. It may seem like a useless distinction, but misunderstandings of scientific concepts lead to tax dollars being spent on religious monuments in places like Kentucky.",

I'll link an article on this.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119391485#:~:text=Chicken%20and%20turkey%20eggs%20are,parthenogenesis%20(Olsen%2C%201975).\n\nThe specific quote of interest from this article would be: \"Chicken and turkey eggs are capable of developing male embryos without fertilization by means of parthenogenesis (Olsen, 1975). Even though the unfertilized egg is haploid, turkey parthenogens contain mostly diploid cells. However, even the sexually mature parthenogen contains approximately 1% haploid cells (Cassar et al., 1998a). It is unknown how diploidy is restored. Recombination of the second polar body with the egg nucleus or absence of meiosis II have been proposed as possible mechanisms for restoration of diploidy (Olsen, 1975)\"\n\nEdit: My only explanation as to why there was no shell is that this hen is just younger and, as such, is more likely to have malformed and sometimes have missing shells. It's pretty common in chickens to lay some weird 'eggs' in their younger years.",

Most turkeys are produced this way, and any actual breeding is performed through artificial insemination.\n\nWhile parthenogenesis is rare but not unheard of in highly complex animals like reptiles and birds, mammals have more complex sets of sex linked genetic systems where males and females both require certain genetic material from the other to generate a viable zygote.  If a human egg started replicating, it would be unable to develop fully as it would be missing key DNA.",

Many people mention parthenogenesis, but it is also very common for some fowl to be hermaphroditic. You may have another hen around her that appears female, but is partially male. Look up \u201chen feathering\u201d or Sebright bantam fowl, whom have been bred specifically to have hen feathering and be hermaphroditic. There are also strains of gamefowl known as \u201cHennies.\u201d This specific strain has the males almost all 100% showing hen feathering patterns. I have personally owned these and will tell you that hermaphrodites are very common. It makes it very hard to raise a group for egg laying or breeding purposes. There is no reason that this same gene that was isolated to create this breed cannot also come about randomly in any flock of chickens.",

They taste amazing dont let the look fool ya, what youre supposed to do is. youre supposed to take a normal egg and crack it in the frying pan. And then take the lash egg sack and split it open on top of the egg you already have cooking. Once the egg on the bottom is cooked to your liking, fold the bottom egg over the lash egg and seal it inside. Super gooey oozey and yummy. Im telling you!! Tastes like funky cheese but with a sorta crunchy, oily pus like creamy texture. Fucking delicious. \n\nAlso tastes great on toast!! You have to collect a couple and sometimes theyre different colors but dont mind that. Just crush them in a small bowl and whisk with a fork youll see small veins and a couple bulbous lumps, you have to crush them to get the creamy pus to mix itll turn into a cream. When youre done, smear the strong smelling cream on your toast and wala!!",

            "comment": "I have heard, technically, this is possible in Humans. It's possible for ovaries to produce a small amount of sperm. Lest anyone think this is an easy explanation of The Virgin Birth of Jesus note that any sperm produced would, like female eggs, have only X Chromosome DNA and therefore be female. Of course, if you're going to throw shade on the Virgin Birth then the simplest explanation other than the one given (which, just to state bias and also stop people think I'm trolling Christians - which I'm not, because I am one).  \n\n\nPut more simply, Either the Virgin Mary was divinely impregnated or she was a liar and Joseph was gullible. Any other explanation makes no sense. I believe the former but, if you're going to disbelieve it then the latter is really the only sensible option.  \n\n\nSorry if I went a bit off topic at the end there.   \n\n\nGoing back on topic, I believe it's possible for a lot of species to produce offspring without a male around (It's most well known in amphibians - hence the 'life will find a way' quote as the theory in \"Jurassic Park\" is that the 'gaps' in the dinosaur DNA were filled in with Amphibian DNA - I'm guessing all this is so much pseudoscience as I would have thought Bird DNA or reptile DNA would be considered closer matches).  \n\n\nAphids always reproduce asexually, I wonder whether this was always the case or whether there was, at some point, a male of the species. I wouldn't know. Any science I've learned since my GCSEs has been self-taught. I retain information well but haven't studied any comprehensive course of study in science since then, just lots of reading and documentary-watching",

                    "comment": "You heard incorrectly - true ovaries do not have the functional properties necessary to produce sperm. You likely heard about a case of human chimerism where XY and XX zygote fused during conception so that the person was born with one functional ovary (producing eggs) and one functional testis (producing sperm). All true cases of hermaphroditism that results in an ovitestis (fusion combination of an ovary and teste) have no functional spermatogenesis process. It is the rare individual who would also have the proper ducts like fallopian tubes or vas deferens to allow fertilization as well. So yes, theoretically possible with the first situation I described, but no cases of auto fertility have ever been reported in human hermaphrodites due to the immense improbability of both oppositional functional gonads plus connected pathways to support the passage of the gametes to each other in the first place. Proper hormone function for conception is a whole other can of worms as well.",

Just an organic syringe filled with DNA that invades cells to produce more organic syringes with DNA because it can. You can call a bunch of proteins with DNA inside alive, since it does stuff on its own, but it cannot replicate without a cell. That's why biologists say there's no life without cells, and the cell is the basic unit of life. Viruses are something less than a cell but more than a non-replicating organic molecule.",

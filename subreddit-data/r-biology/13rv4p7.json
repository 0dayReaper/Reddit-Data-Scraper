    "postText": "Hello everyone! \n\nI\u2019m a senior undergrad majoring in general biology and minoring in chemistry. Im completely obsessed and have a passion for genetics and molecular biology. In the fall of 2021, I decided to enter my little research info dump into my school\u2019s academic symposium for the spring of 2022. I was a semi-finalist! I was really proud of myself, especially since I have bipolar type 2. I hold this project dear and close to me. I spent endless nights perfecting it to the best of my ability and ensuring I understood the content I was reading. \n\nDon\u2019t even get started on molecular though, I read research articles and annotate them for fun during my free time. It\u2019s ridiculous. \n\nThe overall image is a little blurry so I included section pictures for clarity, alongside references. If I need to post the links as well I 100% will. Already have them ready just in case lol. \n\nAnyways, I hope you enjoy! And if I was incorrect in something or you feel the need to clarify anything, by all means please educate me! This is my favorite sub and love the info sharing done. Knowledge is beautiful.",

I really appreciate it! \ud83d\ude01 \n\nEven though it\u2019s hard living with BD, I find the complexity of it so beautiful, ironically. It\u2019s like a puzzle, and you\u2019re trying to crack the code. At the same time, shedding some light on a disorder that can be misunderstood.",

I commend you for your hard work and sharing your enthusiasm for the subject. I think the predispositions for BD is especially puzzling to me vs disorders that can be explained largely by environment/life experience.\n\nMy specialty is neither genetics or psychology, I\u2019m more of an ecology gal now, but the poster presents very well. You should be proud! Keep spreading your love and passion for knowledge!",

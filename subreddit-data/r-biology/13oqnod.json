The Indigo Bunting\u2019s blue is a result of the reflective structure of the feathers\u2014from different angles, the blue appears to change hues and looks \u201cstunning.\u201d\n\n*Pollia condensata* berries are the most intensely structurally colored material found in nature\u2014check out some pictures, they appear sparkly and glittery (however, r/ForbiddenSnacks).",

He also kept on hand his bird book from when he was a boyscout in the 1950s and watch the feeders. So when I was around 8 or 9 I would occasionally get up and sit with him. His old bird book only had a couple of color pages and the Indigo Bunting was featured in color. He said he'd never seen one, so we read up on what they ate and went and bought some seed.\n\nAbout a week later we had two coming into our feeder for the rest of that summer.",

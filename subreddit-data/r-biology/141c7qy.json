The pencil-fish look really cool when they\u2019re looking for worms, sometimes stopping vertically to pick at a spot on the ground. I also have a pond with a steady bloodworm population and the fish will straight up ignore store bought food if there is some freshly stirred substrate or a rock at the bottom gets turned over. They rush over there like a bunch of piranhas and just tear those exposed worms up",

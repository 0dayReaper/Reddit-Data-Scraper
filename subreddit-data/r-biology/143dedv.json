    "postText": "So I'm a UK student studying triple science for GCSE, and I'm revising cell structure and I'm writing down what every part of the cell does. One thing I have to write about is \"nucleus (containing chromosomes, consisting of protein-bound, linear DNA, and one or more nucleoli)\"\n\nI've written about how the nucleus has a nucleoli made of protein and DNA, but I'm stuck on the next part (and really anything else about how the nucleus works- i'm not very good at biology).\n\nI'm not sure about a few things, being:  \nWhat is the nucleus made of?  \nWhat does \"protein-bound\" and \"linear DNA\" mean? (I know prokaryotic cells have DNA in loops, is this just the opposite? DNA in straight lines? What difference does that make (if that's true) ?)\n\nHow exactly does the nucleus control the cell's activities? Like, what does it do to control the cell, what does it even control (also what does the cell even do?? Sorry that sounds dumb I know each component of the cell does different things but what does the cell as a whole do)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked up all of these things but the explanations didn't make sense to me, so I was hoping someone here could help. Thank you! And sorry again if these questions are very simplistic for this subreddit, biology is absolutely not my forte",

            "comment": "Linear DNA is basically just that, DNA in straight lines, instead of a loop. The biggest difference is in how the DNA is copied to make more of it. \n\nYou can think of DNA like a \u201crecipe book\u201d each \u201crecipe inside the book directs the cell to make some specific protein. The nucleus helps to control what \u201crecipes\u201d in the DNA gets read. The DNA is read, and RNA is made, which can then leave the nucleus and go into the cell to bring the directions on what protein to make to the ribosomes where proteins are made.",

            "comment": "Nuclease controls the cell through the production and modification of transcripts. These transcripts are translated into proteins. some proteins perform simple functions while others form complexes with other proteins to perform more complex functions. some proteins are embedded into the cell wall and can regulate the inflow and outflow of certain substances and by increasing and decreasing the amount of these proteins the nucleus can alter the rate.\n\nThe DNA in the nucleus has two ends which makes it linear and proteins called histones aid in the organization of the DNA forming a compact complex called chromatin.",

            "comment": "Protein bound DNA in this context refers to DNA that is wrapped around histone proteins. This wrapping means the DNA is not available to be transcribed to mRNA.\n\nLinear DNA would be the parts that aren't wrapped around histones and are therefore available to be translated into mRNA.\n\nIf you wrap some string around your finger then try and put another string alongside it, you can't really do it for the part around your finger but you can for the string hanging down.\n\nThe central dogma of biology is DNA-&gt;RNA-&gt;Protein. The proteins are your biological functions but they don't exist without RNA and the RNA does not exist without DNA. So the DNA in the nucleus is the backbone of cellular control.\n\nAs to what a cell does, alone not much, together they form your entire body and all the organs including your heart and your brain. Different cells have different functions. Part of how this occurs is that different cells have different parts of the DNA protein bound and different parts as linear.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nI am a second-year undergraduate Biology student from Middle East Technical University, Turkey. I am interested in neurobiology and cell biology, especially in neurodegenerative diseases. Lately, I have been looking for some master's degree opportunities and scholarships worldwide. I am afraid I cannot be accepted for a program with a full scholarship since I will not be able to live there and pay the tuition fee (our currency :))\n\nI am trying to fix my GPA, but because of my psychological problems in my first year, it is already disrupted. Calculus I: CB, Calculus II: CC, Chemistry I: CC. They are the significant grades disrupting my GPA. I cannot retake these courses because of some rules (You cannot take a course to make your grade higher after three semesters.)\n\nMy GPA is currently 3.03, and it will not go beyond 3.50 (it is the minimum GPA for a scholarship, as far as I know). I do not know if my GPA will end above 3.0 and if I can be accepted for a program abroad. I am so hopeless because of the situation here. I am trying to get research experience to increase my chances of being accepted.\n\nEven if I love neurobiology, finding an internship in that field is challenging. I want a master's degree in Neurobiology also. I have research experience in ecology/behavioral ecology with birds, and it will be published as an article soon; I have another experience with the diagnostic method of Parkinson's Disease. Now, I am trying to find another internship that will improve me. I am also accepted for an Erasmus internship in Germany by an academic from Neurobiology. However, I could not get the grant for this year. The situation is getting worse here. I do not know if some institutions can give scholarships for short-term such as two months for an internship.\n\nI do not know what will work for me anymore. Can you please give me some advice for me to improve myself and make my chance higher to being accepted by abroad universities for a master's degree in neurobiology?\n\n(Note: I want especially Europe, but somewhere else would be okay, maybe Japan.)\n\nThank you so much.",

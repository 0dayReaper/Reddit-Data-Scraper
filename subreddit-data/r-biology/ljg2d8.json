My specialization in microbiology helped me get a job in their quality assurance laboratory where we make sure that the products are free of contaminants and other harmful microorganisms.\n\nAside from microbiology, other specializations in biology such as molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics, plant and animal biology, and others can also land you a job in different scientific research institutes which allows you to work full-time in a laboratory.",

This info will be on the university website, in the departmental website, etc. It will list the professors who run labs and what research they do. The professors/labs may have individual websites with more details and list their staff etc. \n\nsometimes you may see research posters hung in the hallways of buildings. At the top of these posters, you will see the names of the authors. the LAST author is the professor who runs the lab. \n\nEmail the professor if you think the research is interesting and something you\u2019d like to learn. Be polite.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \u201cGood afternoon my name is X, I am interested in doing research and so I am reaching out to ask if there are any available positions for undergraduates in your lab. I am interested in your lab because \\[give specific reasons\\]. I have taken \\[list relevant courses such as Bio 1, Chem 1 whatever\\]. For your reference, I am attaching my transcript. Thank you very much for your time. Kind regards, \\[your name\\]\u201d \n\nDo not write them a novel, just be direct and specific. Some universities will have an option of \u201cIndependent research\u201d as an option for credits. Meaning you work in a lab for roughly 9 hours a week for 3 credits a semester. Or something similar. Reach out to your advisors if this is an option for you. Reach out to your science professors and ask them \u201cHow do I find a research opportunity here?\u201d   \n\n\nFeel free to message me if you want any further ideas or specifics.",

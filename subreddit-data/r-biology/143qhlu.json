These are almost certainly catfish bones. \n\nLeft: a section of cranium, the fissures will interlock into several other cranium pieces\n\nCenter top: pectoral fin bone\n\nRight: dorsal spine \n\nCenter bottom: one of the suspended bones in the throat\n\nI articulated several catfish skeletons as a passion project several years ago and I spent longer than I care to admit trying to figure out where everything goes lol",

They're catscan images of catfish skeletons!! \n\nThey're incredible, and it will be a fun project for you to find where each bone went!",

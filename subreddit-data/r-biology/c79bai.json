I believe the movement from a live food source triggers the axolotl's feeding motion a lot quicker than dropping a pellet. And I'm going to cut the lil lotl some slack here as the pellet was dropped more so on the head. In my experience axolotls are much more successful when food is dropped in front of them.",

Or is the animal constantly forging for insects or other foods? The animal that tends to have lower activities usually have slower metabolisms and like to sleep a lot. Think about koalas and how they sleep like more than half the day. Their metabolism is pretty low and they move slow... similar to axolotls but of course have the ability to spend energy to catch live prey when it needs to in the axolotls case",

I fed mine a lot of earthworms, and when they would wiggle in the water, the axolotls were great at striking.  I also kept a separate tank of feeder fish, which would breed, so I always had enough to keep a small school in the axolotl's tank.  They really respond well to live prey that moves, and as others mentioned, smell plays a big part, as well.  \n\nI mean if you didn't see very well, and someone dropped a donut on top of your head, you probably react in a similar way as this little guy.

Some species of moth spin extra silk into a cocoon (basically a silk sleeping bag) around their body before they shed their last  caterpillar exoskeleton into the chrysalis exoskeleton.  You can see the caterpillar exoskeleton to the left of the silk attachment.  The next time either kind of animal sheds the exoskeleton, it will have wings and be able to mate.",

                    "comment": "First of all, those spikes are not legs. Although caterpillars can have up to five pairs of prolegs, which are the soft fleshy appendages that are located toward the posterior end of the larva, like all other insects (which belong to the **Hexa**pod subphylum of arthropods) they only have three pairs of spiky true legs. I'm counting four prominent pairs of spikes in this picture, though I think there may be as many as eight or nine in total, so definitely not caterpillar legs.\n\nSecond, I believe this to be a chrysalis and not a cocoon. While crysalides are the pupal forms of butterflies (which is to say that they're the animals, themselves), cocoons are external structures made of silk and debris that are spun by moth caterpillars (along with other types of insects, such as wasps), within which they pupate. Contrary to popular belief, butterfly caterpillars do **not** spin cocoons, though other animals (like leeches) do, albeit for different reasons (i.e. to protect their eggs, in the case of leeches).",

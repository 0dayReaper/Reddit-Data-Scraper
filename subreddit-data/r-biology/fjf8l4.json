Once a parasite or antigen is targeted by a specific white blood cell (usually a macrophage or dendritic cell) these cells can use chemical signals called chemokines to attract the order cells needed to the fight infection, leading to the cells in the area moving to this parasite like ants as you put it",

These are neutrophils (or maybe eosinophils because this is a parasitic helminth) which are globular cells that don\u2019t have any kind of motor-like proteins like flagella. They move through a process called amoeboid motion, which is kinda like how a slug or inch worm moves and is pretty slow in real time",

It's overstimulation of white blood cells, typically T cells and less often eosinophils (and almost definitely T cells against a virus, as T cells are our primary means of detecting/destroying virally infected cells). Essentially it's a positive feedback loop between excited T cells releasing stuff like IL-2 and interferons and other signaling molecules and then macrophages and dendritic cells and a bunch of other cells releasing stuff like IL-6 and other signaling molecules. This happens in a perpetual loop when a sudden stimulus is added that's too strong. It's seen commonly in monoclonal antibody therapy, CAR T cell therapy, and some infectious diseases (e.g. covid, ebola). \n\nSo it's more like your own immune cells have an adverse response to the sudden presence of something that ticks them off.\n\nSo all these molecules being produced and secreted basically causes your system to go a bit haywire. Lots of cells are responding to these stimuli in ways that are beneficial in small amounts, but not beneficial at that scale. So patients will get sudden onset fever (from the cytokines), shock (from leaky blood vessels), and basically organ failure which could result in death if your body doesn't get things back in control.\n\nThis is the best diagram I could find at a molecular level as relates to viruses \nhttps://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d7481edfad44865d20217d0c3d94d706.webp",

Basically when one immune cell finds something interesting, it secretes chemicals called cytokines that attract the other nearby immune cells. Those nearby immune cells have receptors on them that detect the cytokines and can tell which side of them has a higher concentration, and move in that direction. It\u2019s like a microscopic version of a dog that caught a scent - it starts moving vaguely in that direction and uses the concentration of it to hone in on a target. This causes the 2nd immune cell to do the same thing once it finds its target, and the 3rd, and so on, until the pathogen basically has the biochemical equivalent of a huge flashing sign on it saying \u201cpathogen here\u201d.",

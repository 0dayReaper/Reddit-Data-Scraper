They\u2019re mostly made of *liquid water*\u2026 that\u2019s right, the freaking solvent! They exhale it out of their mouths every breath they take - you can see it condensing on their visors, hot enough to vaporize any of us they come across.\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cOh yeah? Well I heard they breathe *gaseous oxygen*! We spend all our time venting it out of our biospheres because of how corrosive it is, but they walk around with tanks of literal jet fuel on their backs! Their blood is rust colored, apparently. I\u2019ve never seen one bleed because of how thick their hide is, though. \u201d\n\n&gt;\t\u201cEver see them eat? I saw one sprinkle Sodium Chloride all over its food! And then it washed it down with a flask of ethyl alcohol, like it was nothing! How they haven\u2019t completely denatured their proteins into a puddle is beyond me.\u201d",

Fucking everything in our environment either oxidises, has biological resistance, or needs special chemical reinforcement. Aliens would leave their vehicles and proceed to oxidise.\nHeck, we routinely get lightning strikes and wildfires started by a dropped lense or an electric spark here as a matter of course. I can make the inside of a room explode with a bunch of flour due to our high ox environment. We are the life that didn't just survive that, but embraced it, using fire to bootstrap civilisation, using it to prep food, stay warm, forge metals, for self defence and agriculture.",

The claim that fungi use melanin to absorb EM radiation isn't extraordinary; we do it too. The pathway for how that energy is converted is an intriguing unanswered question.",

For instance, maybe the melanin absorbs radiation, reduces a nearby protein or sugar, which goes into solution in the cell and somehow reaches the mitochondrial electron transport chain. If fungi are using radiation to feed themselves, this would seem like a decent explanation\n\nThat loose redox chemistry could explain this phenomenon. But until these researchers actually explain how this works, all they've got are photos of fungi growing in radiation",

A bond formed between these wolves and the humans that fed them and protected them and eventually humans began breeding the wolves into fashion accessories",

There is evidence from fossils/bones but it gets hard to tell if the bones are from domesticated dogs or now extinct subspecies of wolves.

Also, as far as I know it isn\u2019t certain if domestication happened once, or multiple times in multiple places.",

Importantly, this haplotype was also found in one pre-Columbian sample from Mexico (figure 2), suggesting direct ancestry of Chihuahua from ancient Mexican dogs. One individual had haplotype C16, the most common type among the South American breed perro s\u00edn pelo del Peru ... The remaining Chihuahua had universally occurring haplotypes.",

You add correct they cannot birth on their own... they have to have a c-section. But even more crazy is they also can't breed on their own. They need to be artificially inseminated.

Since it limits the possibility of outcrossing even more than strategic seperations of GMO fields and careful choice of location (i.e. a location with no close relatives and/or with a climate unsuited for the GMO). It seems to me that GURT is a very promising avenue of research. Although of course any technology, biotech or otherwise, also has negatives. But what matters most imo (more than farmers or intellectual property rights) is to limit environmental impact, and more effecient crops is one way to do that. Although, I'm studying cell/molecular biology so GMOs is certainly not something I have a very educated opinion on, but one of my old plant physiology professors did a lot of research developing GMOs and his frustrations re:EU restrictions has certainly biased me.",

We have been maximizing efficiency in the monoculture systems heavily for the past 100 years or so. The second school is working towards sustainability and has good research to show that productive biodiversity defeats the failures of intensive monoculture. It sadly reintroduces inefficiency in many ways(elevators to market, intensive harvest methods, long-term vs short-term gains, etc). A small sect of the industry helping to convert smaller farms of say 5 to 1000 acres. The big research money is going towards propping up a failing system with more chemical control, genetic malarkey, and a research scope limited to production disregarding environmental and social impact.

There is always the possibility to compromise as well, which tends to be where I fall. Can't you still protect ecosystems from farming etc. and only allow highly efficient monoculture farming in some locations, and oversee those farms and implement features that improve the biodiversity on or next to the farm, for example by creating ponds and limiting insecticide use to central areas (not the edges of the farm)? You say it is a \"failing\" system but couldn't that also be solved with biotech advancements? Why is it only possible to prop up a \"failure\" and not fix it? It also seems to me needlesly negative to call genetic manipulation \"malarkey\", its among our greatest achievements to understand and start to manipulate genes imo and genetic tools like CRISPR and RNAi are some of the most exciting developments in biology, for research purposes and for many other applications.

Still a monoculture as it's only one crop per field at a time. Massive gains in terms of soil fertility and thus decrease in fertilizer needs. I say current monoculture agriculture isn't sustainable as it destroys soil fertility and relies more and more on government subsidies to exist. That is before we look into super bugs and diseases that are constantly increasing the use of intensive chemicals. The largest benefit I have seen from gmo crops is Monsanto's ability to put small farmers into a courtroom until the farmers have to stop farming. They patented their infectious plants. Truck spills a little on the side of the road and two years later a farmer is out of business forever due to legal fees. Come now. Science may forward humanity until it pushes us off a cliff.",

I'm pretty sure dogs today are bred at far younger ages than 25 years old.  A cursory google search indicates dogs hit puberty around 6 months to 1 year.  Are you saying gestation length is 24 years?",

When these ancient civilizations (12,000-15,000 years ago) crumbled, the Stone Age began from the few that survived the last great change.  That ancient civilization was vastly more advanced than we are today. The remnants are being dredged up in oceans all over the world. The majority of humanity lives today in the high savage country of the ancient world. Only primitive savages lived here. Every one else lived on dry land 1500 feet under sea levels today. Hippos, rhinos, elephants, dogs, wolves lions, etc... all of them genetically modified to do do the bidding of ancient man, and very little traits resembling what they were before. We are the ignorant stagnant remnants of the great species that ruled over this ancient world. I know it\u2019s hard to wrap your mind around it, and your probably writing me off as crazy.

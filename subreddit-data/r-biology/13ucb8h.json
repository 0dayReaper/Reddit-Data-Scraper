    "postText": "hi all,\n\ni am a recent biology grad and got my first job doing field work. the job will take place entirely on wind farms (i\u2019m in the american midwest) and i\u2019ll be working pretty much independently save for weekly meetings.\n\nthe job will be outside all day and will involve me walking by foot around the property for the entirety of my day. i\u2019ve honestly never done much field work before, so i\u2019m wondering how bathrooms are typically handled in these types of situations? \n\ni am female which makes things a bit more tricky. should i expect there to be a porta potty somewhere on site, or should i be prepared to squat somewhere?\n\napologies for the tmi question. i would feel embarrassed asking my (male) hiring manager if the answer is obvious, so i\u2019m asking reddit.",

Whenever I had to go, I'd just let my partner know so they wouldnt double back to look for me. I'd squat in the bushes and be on my way. The woods are easy to pee in privacy though. Not sure how a wind farm would work. Dont be embarrassed to ask! It's a valid question.",

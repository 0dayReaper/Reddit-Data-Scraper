We don't have to, thanks to a symbiotic relationship with the E.coli living in our intestines. Cell for cell, they outnumber us within our own bodies. We eat the food, our stomach acid turns it to goo, the E.coli eats said goo and poops out nutrients which our body can more readily absorb.\n\nSome people lose that bacteria due to bad infections and/or too many antibiotics. They have to get a poop transplant down their esophagus in order to restart the bacteria colony.\n\nWe are disgusting. Lol.",

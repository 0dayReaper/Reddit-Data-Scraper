Edge itself runs on a Chromium engine, so anything that works in Edge should also work in Chrome, except for IE mode apps.",

Women in a lab are supermodels, not in the sense that they are very good looking but more so the fact that there's a strong push to encourage women to go into stem so every other month they would take pictures and interviews which makes it seem like they're \"supermodels.\"",

Sterilize after they're gone.\n* Use your desktop centrifuge - the tiny slow one that starts when you press it closed - on everything.  If you're not working with delicates, also do this with your desktop vortex.  Bonus points for colorful pellets or blatant particulates.\n* Let them get a few shots panning over your chem cabinets; be sure the expiration dates aren't visible.\n* Do you have a lab robot?  Run it though it's calibration.\n* Remember that spare box of ph paper sticks that no one ever uses because you've got a machine for that now? Make up some dilute acids, bases, and some pbs; act very impressed as you get different colors from dipping them.\n* Run the glassware dishwasher.  It probably needs doing anyway.\n* Is the reporter going to be featured in the clips?  Get them in full PPE, including the best goggles the lab can offer.  Teach him how to use a pipette and/or graduated cylinder and have him make up some TAE or other simple, non-sterile, hard-to-screw-up buffer solution.  Bonus points if he's just diluting the 50x stock or whatever.  Tell him it's toxic and may explode if spilled, inhaled, swallowed, or looked at without goggles on for some real method acting.  If you weren't watching the whole procedure, trash the solution after; you can't trust his measurements.\n* If that's not enough, have the undergrad dangle keys in front of them while you get some work done.",

Of course any crime-fighting tv show has time constraints but I feel like this one makes some pretty decent depictions as well as staying true to executions. I also particularly enjoy the Bones TV show but I feel like some of the depicted scenarios can be pretty far-fetched ideas of what a forensic anthropologist does irl and what can actually be reasonably gathered from evidence (even if you\u2019re a genius).",

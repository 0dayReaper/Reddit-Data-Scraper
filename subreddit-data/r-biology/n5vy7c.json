I mean caterpillars are pretty simple, but I don't think it's necessarily accurate to assume that all seemingly simple animals are just unconscious automotons. Some ants have been observed passing the mirror test for example, so they may have a degree of self-awareness. Not saying caterpillars also do, they really might be autonomatons, but we don't really know. \n\nSome insects are capable of surprisingly sophisticated behaviors. Bees, for example, have a primitive sort of proto-language with their waggle dance. Bees have about a million neurons in their brain. A far cry from the nearly 100 billion in a human brain, but enough that complex internal processes aren't necessarily out of the question.",

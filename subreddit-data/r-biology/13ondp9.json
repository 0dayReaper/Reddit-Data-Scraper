            "comment": "It sounds like they\u2019re anatomically normal humans? If they aren\u2019t adapted to that kind of environment and have to augment themselves just to function they probably wouldn\u2019t be much different as long as there wasn\u2019t any major difference between wild type humans. You could argue they would have more health issues related to bone and muscle structure from all the extra pressure on their joints but it\u2019s hard to quantify that. \n\nIf they were adapted to a high-gravity environment and came to earth you would probably have a situation like the blobfish. Completely normal in their own environment, deformed and unrecognizable under significantly reduced pressures.",

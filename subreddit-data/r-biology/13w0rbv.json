            "comment": "My part of the ecological world is in mutualism (a type of species interaction) where they are used as a way of describing the topology of interacting species groups (we call these guilds, like pollinators and flower-producing plants), using concepts like modularity, connectance, nestedness, etc. We also use the networks to predict ecological and co-evolutionary outcomes. To my knowledge, these networks aren\u2019t derived from lower principals, but applied given the nature of the interactions (pollinators only pollinate animal-pollinated plants/animal-pollinated plants don\u2019t pollinate each other directly). Does this begin to get at your inquiry?",

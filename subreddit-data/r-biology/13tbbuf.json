    "postText": "Hey, I wonder, how gills work: \nAs far as I know, the oxygen from the water diffuses into the gill\u2019s blood vessels. But how can that be enough to create a high enough oxygen partial pressure in the blood? \nDo fish etc. need less OPP, or do they have different haemoglobin or any other mechanism to ensure a adequate oxygen supply?",

            "comment": "Some fish utilize countercurrent exchange. Basically, the deoxygenated blood is passed through the rear of the gills and pumped forward. This makes sure that there is always a gradient between the oxygen content of the water, and the oxygen content of the blood that favors more oxygen entering the blood.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countercurrent_exchange",

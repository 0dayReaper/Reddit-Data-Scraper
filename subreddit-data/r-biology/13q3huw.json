What stops us from doing this?\nIf the technology or science doesn\u2019t exist yet, will it in the future? How could that be commercialized? Ex would we see giant frogs and massive cats on display at a zoo-like kind of place? Or would it be too hard to sustain them?",

Then there are also the concerns of possible escape of the larger animal, legislation around messing with genetic code of animals, the fact that such an animal would consume a lot of food and the likelyhood that a frog that size would just fall apart due to it's large volume/surface ratio. Ultimately it's just too much of a hassle to make animals that big, It would cost too much and yield too little.",

Increasing the size of an organism beyond its natural limits could indeed have detrimental effects on its quality of life, including health issues and compromised functionality. Additionally, the escape of larger animals could pose risks to ecosystems and public safety.",

            "comment": "From a biological perspective, the creation of a bus-sized frog or giant cat is not currently within the realm of possibility. The size of organisms is governed by various factors, including genetic instructions, metabolic constraints, and physical limitations. The growth processes and body plans of different species have evolved over millions of years, leading to the diverse range of sizes we observe in nature.  \nWhile scientific advancements may allow for modifications in the future, the creation of such extreme size variations would require a comprehensive understanding of the intricate genetic and physiological mechanisms involved. Additionally, ethical considerations, environmental sustainability, and animal welfare would be significant factors to address when considering commercialization or public display of such organisms.",

It follows, there is a critical limit for organisms growth.\n\nBasically organisms that are too big can't sustain their volume (cube) with their surface of absorption (square).",

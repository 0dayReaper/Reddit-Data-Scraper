I've come across an awesome book called, \"Feathers: The evolution of a natural miracle\" and I was wondering if there was any such non-fiction science book (for us general public, non-academics) that traces the fascinating history of poison/venom evolving in animals, fishes or insects as a biological weapon or a chemical that helps with mating or whatever purpose.",

The person was correcting OP for making shit up or sensationalizing something already pretty cool, as you pointed out. Not a Debbie downer thing, and an \u201couter layer of sulphurous iron compound\u201d doesn\u2019t equal iron plated. \n\nThe joke didn\u2019t land because this is biology, and it was misplaced.",

Only about 10% of confirmed brown recluse bites result in serious skin complications. \nThat being said, knowing the increasing distribution of the Mediterranean recluse (\ud835\ude13\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude39\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude34 \ud835\ude33\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude27\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude34), a similar species with similar venom, I would not be surprised to find isolated populations in homes near places with high tourism. However, it would be rare.",

They\u2019re everywhere, more or less (like bees) you won\u2019t get bit but even if you do you have to be one of the unlucky few that has a bad reaction to get anything other than a welt for a couple days(like bees).",

And Cetacea is now known to be nested within Artiodactyla.   \nIt looks like you've been using some old morphologically based phylogenies to make this?  \n\nAves should be coming out of Reptilia, and ideally be split into at least Palaeognathae and Neognathae. Aves, Reptilia, Mammalia and Amphibia would be clearer if they were coming out of Tetrapoda stemming out of Sarcopterygii to clarify things.",

For instance, doesn't osteichyes include all mammals/reptiles/etc? Aves should be diverging from Reptilia. Clade sarcopterygii includes humans, lizards, etc too. You've also cut some really major phyla like nematoda. It's your choice to cut some clades and keep others, of course, and I doubt nematodes would be too fun to draw, but there are 57 billion nematodes for every human on earth so they're pretty big!",

The taxonomic tree of life would be a whole lot more complicated with each group splitting off from the most recent ancestor.

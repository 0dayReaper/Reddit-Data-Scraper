Urine contains plenty of bacteria and waste product that could cause infection, but so does sweat, saliva, semen, etc. Since the spread of bacteria is already frequent during intercourse, even without watersports, throwing pee into the mix probably wouldn\u2019t cause infection risk to increase significantly. \n\nAlso, please do not pee on open wounds!!! Urinating on a wound has zero benefits and can lead to infection because of the bacteria in pee. Blood flow is the best way to flush a wound; white blood cells, which help fight off disease and infection, will coat the wound and protect it.",

Did you pee at a crime scene and are now worried your DNA is present?\n\nIn all seriousness, if you\u2019re worried about pregnancy due to PIV urination then it\u2019s unlikely but possible. The urine would likely irrigate the area and the concentration of sperm would be low. Semen contains nutrients to help keep sperm alive and ward off the natural vaginal defenses (vaginas attack sperm), and most sperm cells still die within the vagina. Additionally, semen gets stickier in the vagina which helps it to stick around longer. Without the protective benefits of semen and at an already low concentration, rogue sperm cells in urine are very unlikely to lead to fertilization. It\u2019s not impossible, but the odds for fertilization are likely very low.",

If so sperm are more motile at body temperature if this urine were to have ended up inside someone. That being said, urine isn't a great environment for sperm to live in, so not very long. Plus, the secretions that make up the ejaculate contain nutrients and buffers that allow the sperm to survive and travel up into the uterus. Urine doesn't really do that.\n  \nIf you're worried about pregnancy, use Plan B if you are able to. As some words of comfort, it is very unlikely that this can get you or someone else pregnant, but it's always better to play it safe.\n  \nGood luck!",

Chemical reactions becoming spontaneous at certain temps? I would love to know more about why this happens",

Apparently it has to do with extreme weather / temp changes or something\n\nAlso after some research it appears red maples have often pink or red juvenile samsara but turn to brown later. Red maples only turn red in the fall according to my research. But this doesn\u2019t account for the fact this never happened to you in this colour.",

I was hopeful that this sub would give me a more scientific answer with a source that I couldn't find myself. I may have to take it to one of my bio profs but they're traveling for the summer",

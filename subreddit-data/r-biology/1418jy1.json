            "comment": "Transposons (aka jumping genes) are a step below viruses for being almost alive. Transposons code for proteins that cause the transposon to be copied and added to a new position in the genome. It\u2019s basically like a virus that never forms a protein capsule to move to new cells.\n\nPrions act kind of alive at first glance\u2014they spread through normal flesh and make more of themselves, taking in normal versions of their protein and causing them to reshape  into the defective prion form. It\u2019s really just a self-catalyzed pattern of protein misfolds but people thought that prion diseases came from bacteria or viruses for a long time because they grow and they can transmit person-to-person in some cases.\n\nTumor cells can be surprisingly hard to categorize. You can argue that tumor cells are just malfunctioning body cells and therefore shouldn\u2019t be counted as a separate organism. This gets cloudy when you get into the world of transmissible tumors (thankfully none affect humans). There is a line of dog tumor cells that have been passed dog to dog for 11,000 years, long after the original cancerous dog died. Can we still say that these cells are a part of that original dog when they have been functioning as unicellular parasites for thousands of years?",

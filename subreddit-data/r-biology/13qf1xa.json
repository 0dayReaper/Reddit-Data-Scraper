Same with Calcium actually, I know it's in our bones, but why don't we ever find it in nature, and why are both of these even inside our bodies to begin with if iron is pretty much space waste (as to say it's non reactive and doesn't do anything from a chemistry perspective) and calcium is apparently assuredly rare? Even if it was all used up during the beginning of life or something you'd think rotting animals would replenish it, so what's up?\n\nP.S: also I'm not sure if I should put this here or on r/chemistry or something.",

For instance, pure sodium is a metal and is rare in nature because it burns when you add water, but it's common in all living things and found in table salt, NaCl.\n\nMost of the metals that living things use are like this. When salt dissolves in water, it separates into Na+ ions and Cl- ions, and this is the easiest form for living things to take them into their cells, because it's just floating around in the water.\n\nCalcium as a metal is rare in nature, but it's very common in water (it's part of limescale).\n\nSo most of the time living things get their metal ions from sources that are not pure, because it's more common and easier to use.",

Iron has a rich redox chemistry between oxidation states II, III and IV to offer, which is exactly what our bodies use it for and calcium is something like the 5th most common element in the earth's crust as its part of plenty of minerals, like limestone for example.",

            "comment": "&gt; iron is pretty much space waste (as to say it's non reactive and doesn't do anything from a chemistry perspective)\n\nIron\u2019s very reactive. For one thing, it rusts easily. That\u2019s a chemical reaction with oxygen called oxidization. \n\n&gt; Same with Calcium actually, [\u2026] Even if it was all used up during the beginning of life or something you'd think rotting animals would replenish it, so what's up?\n\nBingo! Chalk, limestone and marble are derived from the accumulation of ancient zooplankton shells. The animals took up water-soluble forms of calcium from seawater and chemically converted them to insoluble calcium carbonate to build their shells. Then when they died they fell to the bottom of the ocean and built up large accumulations of calcium carbonate. \n\nToday, chalk and limestone are a significant source of calcium in freshwater. \n\nAbiogenesis (the origin of life, the natural process by which life has arisen from non-living matter) occurred near thermal vents on the ocean floor. The water at these vents has high concentrations of iron and calcium.",

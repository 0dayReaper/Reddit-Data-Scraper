I hope I have not told them wrong, but now I'm doubting myself, and a quick search doesn't say anything about whether there might still be some protein in there.",

Pour chilled isopropyl alcohol  (90/10 or 70/30) slowly down the wall of test tube held at 45 degree angle, to place a cold layer of alcohol  on to the strained liquid.

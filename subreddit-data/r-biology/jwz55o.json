It starts in the interphase which is just the phase where it prepares itself for splitting. Prophase is where the chromosomes inside the cells go to the different sides of the nucleus. Metaphase is where the nucleus walls break down and the DNA is movedto the middle and small threads that lead to the poles of the cell. Anaphase takes the DNA and moves it to the poles and telophase is where the cell splits into two.",

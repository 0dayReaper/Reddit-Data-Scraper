    "postText": "Where should be?\n\n1-. DNA EXAMPLES:\n\nSuppose we are not creatures around this DNA search, then we have to consolidate this fact (purpose method).\n\nIf we are not DNA and again we are non-creatures (matter), where did our birth in DNA ideas come from?\n\nAll non-species are due to that, therefore any other creature itself had to be on a countdown to something to establish itself as creatures in this internal biological act, so where does our DNA improve the solid odds of making us ? And the self for us?\n\nAnd what about where our DNA makes us aware? Just about who to care for.\n\nAbsolutely, we are those creatures who may be aware of the youthful meaninglessness of life, but\u2026 Instead, if the last statement is not a fake engine part, then how can it be drastically resolved?\n\nWhere are the non-creatures around the DNA, and within the DNA, where is it from if there is no creature that is me?\n\nIf there is no creature, then the DNA will stop its essence to signify. Therefore, approaches to search for the DNA of other creatures are meaningless, but it is a fact. It is the current state of the DNA, \"that good meaning towards the DNA is for progress within the persistence of oneself\" and methodologically being in and.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we are at x, where is the DNA if no creature can hypothetically get through and where is the weird meaning of looking for DNA if there are no creatures to find the DNA and where if there are no creatures around? Isn't DNA the one that makes each one a single individual around everything in the search for inner care of oneself? So we didn't have to stay in y a priori so that nobody would have to be in x as well. So we have to move things around the bias of not abiding in order not to be an energetic matter non-creature whose DNA does not make us codependent on consciousness through the material around the DNA. Leaving for y within the actual state of ego dependence y constantly around x and thus inclined to remain in x to add y to the next form of ego.",

But that pond is full of decaying matter it is likely anoxic \u2014 so they rely more on air from the surface.\n\nAs they metamorphose, they lose their gills. Frogs are obligate air breathers. But they actually still retain the ability to get oxygen through their skin \u2014 just not enough without gills.",

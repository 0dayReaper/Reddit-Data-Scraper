It made me happy to see that she knows corals are animals!\n\nI\u2019m a paleontologist and I love that fossils made it in there. She picked out some incredibly cool animals to include. She may like the book [I Am Not a Dinosaur!](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/25986222-i-am-not-a-dinosaur#) by Will Lach. It goes through some fossil animals that aren\u2019t dinosaurs, which she seems to show interest in. \n\nI bet she\u2019d be interested to know that Dimetrodon isn\u2019t a dinosaur, it belongs to a group that\u2019s more closely related to mammals! Mammals are part of a larger group called synapsids, and there are some amazing fossil synapsids out there. \n\nArthropleura was a giant millipede, and that group includes the largest land invertebrates that we know of. If she is interested in giant extinct invertebrates, I bet she\u2019d like eurypterids, commonly called sea scorpions, and meganeurans, often referred to as giant dragonflies (but they\u2019re a different group!). \n\nArchelon is a turtle, of course, and the largest turtle we know of. Carbonemys is another giant fossil turtle. And of course, modern leatherbacks are remarkably big. It\u2019s so cool that we get to live on a planet with them. \n\nThis is not normally how I\u2019d frame a comment for someone her age, but she is clearly doing a lot of research and she sure seems to know her stuff. If she ever has any questions about fossils or biology, feel free to message me.",

I teach middle school science and I had a student send me a picture of her at-home lab experiments today, on a Sunday!! One assignment I had was for my students to create an invention and draw it out. The invention had to track a tornado. The creativity and detailed sketches I saw from my kids floored me. Your child\u2019s drawings reminded me of that!\n\nKeep encouraging these behaviors. Maybe try going out to a park and document/draw what she sees while outside. Talk about why you don\u2019t see certain living things in your area. Apply climate regions like deserts, rainforests into the mix. You have a budding biologist! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

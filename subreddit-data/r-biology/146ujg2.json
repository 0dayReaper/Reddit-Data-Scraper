    "postText": "So this is a genuine question..I read/watch lots about anxiety and its ancient foundations in flight or flight (freeze,fawn)..and the reason for increased gut motility when anxious is thought to be so that you can clear your bowels immediately and are therefore lighter and can move faster to escape. I call bullshit on this one though, as to me it's more logical that if you're about to be eaten/attacked by a big animal, shitting yourself will almost guarantee to repel the attacker. Anyone that disagrees with my hypothesis has only to take a subway train and wait for an olfactorily-challenged homeless person to board and observe how people react to moving as far from the stink source as possible...that, but 100,000 years ago.\n\nTell me I'm wrong?",

            "comment": "I don't think a pile of doots is gonna repel a predator, maybe distract them because to them it smells good?  But I really don't think it's a muskrat strategy, I think it really is the result of a sudden shift from the digestive functions to the fight or flight responses.  A result of this is that the bowels empty.  \nAs for function - what it's \"for\" - or as I would ask what is the use that it is still in our gene pool?  And that of many other mammals, at least.  The only viable option I can think of is speed, but really Mayne it's just the result of a process that can't be helped.  Evolution does not always have a \"purpose\".\n\nEdit:  alright but maybe if you crap yourself and DON'T run, just sit there in it, it could disguise your scent?  Let us know!",

            "comment": "Fight or flight situations commonly arise from predatory threats. Other animals also have \u201cstress pooping\u201d responses (such as horses) and their feces would be leaving a huge scent indicator for predators, and most predators aren\u2019t going to be repelled by the smell of feces as it\u2019s actually super informative to know what other animals may be around at any given time. Given that we share this behavior with other animals who aren\u2019t repelled by the scent of feces like we are, I\u2019d operate under the assumption that it\u2019s from a far back common ancestor and likely not developed via convergent evolution.",

This is turned off during survival, and the sphincter releases, allowing poop to come out. Simply put, our bodies care more about surviving when in danger, not holding in poop. So people can be seen pooping when in danger.",

It\u2019s likely that crapping your pants isn\u2019t a trait that serves a purpose, and more a byproduct of the physiological change that occurs with the flight or fight response. The purpose isn\u2019t crap your pants because X beneficial result of pants pooping, the pooping of the pantaloons is secondary to your body going \u201coh shit scary thing quick stop digesting and get running\u201d",

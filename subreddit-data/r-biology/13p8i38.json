            "comment": "There are indeed some plants that undergo changes in their toxicity levels at different stages of growth or during certain seasons. These plants are known as \"ephemeral\" or \"seasonal\" toxic plants. However, it's important to note that not all plants exhibit this behavior, and the majority of plants maintain their level of toxicity throughout their lifespan.\n\nAn example of a plant with varying toxicity is the common pokeweed (Phytolacca americana). While the young shoots and leaves of pokeweed can be consumed after careful preparation, the plant becomes increasingly toxic as it matures, with the berries being particularly poisonous. Other examples include certain mushrooms, where the edibility and toxicity can change based on the growth stage.",

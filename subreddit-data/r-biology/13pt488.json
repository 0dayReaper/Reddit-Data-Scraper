    "postText": "If you and your brother biologically shared a mother but not a father then you would have the same X chromosome, right? So if your brother had a daughter she would also inherit that X, but if he has a son that son gets your brother\u2019s Y and his mothers X. I know that you\u2019d still be related to to his son, but I\u2019m just wondering if his daughter would share more of your dna? Or does recombination make this question irrelevant?\n\nSorry if this is a dumb question, thought about it while trying to fall asleep, and really need an answer.",

            "comment": "The X chromosome inherited from the mother is completely random (just like it's random if a specific sperms has an X or a Y chromosome).\n\nHowever interestingly enough you do inherit slightly more DNA from your mother than from your father due to the maternal inheritance of the mitochondria. Mitochondria are the only cell organelles in animals to have their own genome (chloroplasts in plant cells also have their own DNA). \n\nNow there are only a few genes in the mitochondria (37 I believe in humans), and these all relate to the structure and function of the mitochondria, while your nuclear genome contains the DNA that makes you you (and is inherited from both parents). Mitochondria are passed only only through women (due to how fertilisation works). So you would share the same mitochondria (and therefore mitochondrial DNA) with maternal half-siblings but not paternal half-siblings.\n\nIn your example this wouldn't matter because you are related to the kids via a male relative who can't pass on his mitochondria. But I thought it was interesting.\n\nTLDR: The X chromosome passed on is random and no guarantee two siblings would get the same one from their mother. Mitochondrial genomes have strict maternal inheritance but that DNA isn't part of what makes you you.",

Since the half brother and you both have the same X chromosome from your mom, his daughter would have her moms X and her dads (the half brother) X, the same  X from the mom you share. His son, however, would only have one X, (his moms) not given to him by the half brother. The Y that the son gets is through the half brother\u2019s biological father, who is not your biological father.",

If your brother had a daughter, she would inherit her father's X chromosome, which would be the same X chromosome that you share with your brother. However, due to recombination during meiosis, genetic material is shuffled between homologous chromosomes, including the X chromosome. Recombination creates genetic diversity and can result in different combinations of genes being passed down to offspring. Therefore, while there may be similarities in the X chromosome between you and your brother's daughter, recombination makes it difficult to determine the exact extent of shared DNA.",

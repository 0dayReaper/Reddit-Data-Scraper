Note that the main leaf architecture (mid vein, secondary veins, tertiary veins, smooth margin, general shape) is the same in both leaves, the main difference is the degree of lobation which can be due to many factors, but light and position on tree have been documented to influence this. For woody plants (not all plants respond the safe, phylogenetics play an important role) leaves grown under high light will be smaller and leaves grown under low light will be larger. This is all due to the leaf growing to best fit it\u2019s environment, botanists describe this as organ plasticity. Water stress &amp; air temperature can also influence leaf morphology!!",

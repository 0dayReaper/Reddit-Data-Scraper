I've run these samples twice and I'm about to cry :') Has anyone had issues with clear bands showing up the wrong length?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ak8j1l9nn5b1.png?width=306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0ac9b7eee7d90ea0f9a62ca5ab9e57e07037b1a6",

What is the GC content of your template? Have you checked your primer for GC and possible cross-binding or secondary structures?\nClear bands at wrong length must mean that the primer bind to the wrong sequence, thus the polymerase is able to make such a long product in the first place. You need to find out where the primer might bind and why",

If not, something is off with the template itself (check by linearizing and running a gel; is it still the length it should have or somewhat degraded?) or said primer. Maybe a contamination?",

We just bought a new primer and it worked for the other DNA samples. The correct bands showing up (without the mess of the smaller bands) has always been consistent with our other mouse lines, but just the bands from this specific mouse line is not showing up at the right length. I do think it might be some possible cross-binding, but I don't know how to start investigating that and optimizing the protocol. I reference this page as this is where we got the mice: https://www.jax.org/Protocol?stockNumber=017763&amp;protocolID=20897",

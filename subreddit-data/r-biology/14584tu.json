    "postText": "Hi folks!\n\nI am just wondering, because there's probably a hereditary disease in one side of my family - I do not know the exact nature of it, but I am pretty sure it's hereditary and it probably shows from birth, but I am not sure about that either - and my grandma had it and my aunt, but my dad doesn't seem to have it, but he could be a carrier. As far as I am aware I don't have it either but my brain is still developing (it impacts the brain). I read that hormones can activate certain genes, and my question is; if my dad carries the disease, is it likely that I have it as well? And if so, would it be save to go on testosterone or might that activate the disease? Is there a reliable way to know that in advance with the little information I have available?",

            "comment": "OK so let's break it down, obviously without knowing the detail of what this disorder is no one is going to be able to give you a definitive answer but I'll try and give you some other things to look into.\n\nLet's assume it is genetic, at the most basic it could have either a dominant (you only need one affected allele to have the disorder) or a recessive (you need two affected alleles to have the disorder) inheritance pattern.\n\nBased on what you have described (affected parental grandmother and aunt but unaffected father) it seems unlikely it has a recessive inheritance unless your father's father was a carrier for the same disorder (rare but not impossible and more likely in certain closed communities). In that case it has a dominant inheritance pattern and the fact your father does not have the disorder would mean that he did not inherit the affected allele from his mother and therefore could not pass it on to you.\n\nThis does assume a simple mendelian inheritance  of a disease or disorder caused by just one gene. Without knowing anything about the disorder I couldn't tell you if that is the case or not.\n\nEpigenetics is something a little different, it is the inheritance of genetic traits not linked to order of bases in DNA but instead usually it is the switching on or off of genes either due to environmental conditions experienced by the parent/grandparent (such as famine) to pre-adapt the offspring to expected environmental conditions. Or it is the switch on or off of genes depending on which parent that copy of inherited from (usually called genomic imprinting). This process can do wrong in what are called DNA methylation disorders.\n\nI would advise you to find out more about the condition, a careful google search of the name of the disorder would be a good starting point, look for websites from national health organisations (I'm in the UK so I'd look at the NHS website). This will give you more information, you can find out if it is genetic and what it's inheritance pattern is (there are other kinds of genetic disorders such as Huntingtons which have more complex inheritance patterns). This will give you a clearer idea of your risk.\n\nI would then suggest speaking with your health care provider, they will have the clearest idea of the risks involved, be able to advise you further and, if appropriate, refer you for genetic testing",

    "postText": "i dont know if this is the right place to ask this, but a few days ago i was at a theme park and on a rollercoaster i accidentally slammed my elbow onto the cart, mind u this was while the rollercoaster was zooming and the pain was quite intense. i have hit my funny bone before but this funny bone encounter left my entire arm burning and it was very much a painful experience, unlike other times that this has occured. \n\nfast forward now and a slight touch will set off this burning sensation. i rested my elbow on my desk whilst working and it suddenly felt like i had hit it again. same thing for the last couple of days. somestimes it feels completely fine and then other times, a little touch against furniture will send my entire arm ablaze.   \n\n\nis this concerning enough to see a doc? or is this just a normal effect of slamming into ones funny bone that should - hopefully - die down?",

It sounds like you probably hit it hard enough to damage it a bit. I don\u2019t know if doctors can do anything to help it heal (it may well heal on its own) but it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask.",

            "comment": "Pain in itself is seldom a cause for alarm. If you have full mobility and strength in your arm and hand, and no swelling/redness, you're probably fine. Otherwise see a doctor. If it's so painful that you reflexively parry that movement you could also need to see a doctor, but nerve damages like this is a very lengthy and diffuse path to treatment. Give it some time in that case before seeking help.",

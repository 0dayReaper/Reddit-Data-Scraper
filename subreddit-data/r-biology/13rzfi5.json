    "postText": " Hi everyone. This upcoming Fall semester I'm beginning my Biotech degree and I have the next three months to hopefully maximize my time and efforts before I begin my degree program. I'm wondering if you all had any advice for me.\n\nFor context, I have a passion for Biotech, although my previous experiences are not directly related. I'm interested in finding internships that could provide me with hands-on experience and exposure. If you know of any organizations, research institutions, or biotech companies that offer internships to individuals who are not currently enrolled as students, I'd appreciate your recommendations.\n\nThanks!",

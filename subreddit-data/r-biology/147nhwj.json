    "postText": "I don't have a clue what I should Google to find out what it's called and if it's normal, so I figured I'll just ask here.\n\nSo when I get scared by something (a loud noise behind me, my GF jumping from around a corner to scare me etc), i feel some sort of sharp pain going through my body. \nIt's mainly in the gut area and the limbs.\n\nI thought it's some sort of tension because the muscles tense up, but this feeling even happens if the muscles only move very slightly when scared or not at all.\n\nWhat's the biological background to this? Is this a physical or a psychological thing? And most important of all: is this normal for all people? Never heard anyone saying something about it. So my guess that it's super normal or no one else got that.",

I have explained it to them as a lightning bolt through my body. And now it\u2019s a big, funny joke, like they act like they\u2019re gonna fall off something and asked me if I feel the lightning! Interesting to see it has a name.",

Most are just as happy with a BA in art, so long as the candidate has good research experience, grades and the required classes. Many schools don't even offer BS degrees.",

I'm not sure the exact differences where you are, but the hardest parts of getting my BSc in biology/ecology was the calculus and physics req's which I don't think were req's for a BA in biology at my school. So it doesn't necessarily mean you know less biology or anything, but I would still say that a BSc is probably harder and slightly more rigorous in science broadly speaking.\n\nThat being said, I've spent a lot of time working on my biology degree and I know that most people would not consider me a \"biologist\" unless I go into academia which I admit is slightly frustrating. \n\nDon't let a label get you down, you can always keep learning outside of what your degree says.",

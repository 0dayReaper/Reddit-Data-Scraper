Little sap drinking insects that reproduce asexually during the summer (so all of those insects are descended from the same female that flew over to your plant and started giving birth to live nymphs). When the colony gets too crowded some will develop wings and migrate to new plants. I\u2019m not sure which species it is though, might be able to tell you if I knew which plant that was and what part of the world you\u2019re in.",

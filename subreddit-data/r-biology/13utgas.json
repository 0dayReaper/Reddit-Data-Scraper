I'm from central Germany. My dog usually gets one or two ticks after a walk, but I have never seen something like this before. Could there be any health hazards to it?\nThank you in advance!",

SJG is Stephen Jay Gould, who was an evolutionary biologist, and an excellent writer. I highly commend his essays for Natural History magazine which have been collected into books. In the early 70s, he and his collaborator Niles Enbridge (IIRC) challenged the mainstream view that new species arose from gradual transformation as adaptations to minor environmental or other pressures, such as genetic drift (greatly simplified view). Instead, they proposed a model called punctuated equilibrium, where species were fairly static for long periods, then there was a sudden explosion of diversity triggered by external events.  \n\nThose external events might include something like a major volcanic eruption, or the asteroid event that killed off the dinosaurs, even a sudden pandemic that disastrously reduces the population. Or, perhaps, the doubling of the genome. The \"Cambrian explosion\" is thought to be one such event. Gould wrote a book about the subsequent diversity of animals based on fossils in the Burgess shale deposit in British Columbia.\n\nThere is no question evolution occurs through slow adaptations in some environments, such as, IMHO, Darwin's finches and other examples of island biogeography. However, as I mentioned, I am not an expert in the field. It is an interesting area.",

I got bit of a cold but, figured it was because I was teaching K-3 special education. I started getting really sick in the fall of 13 and was misdiagnosed until January of 14. I was sleeping 14 hours a day, couldn't read and remember much. I also had trouble with walking and balance.  Thankfully I'd retired in June of 13.\n\nThe medical profession is much better today at treating possible Lyme than they were just a few years ago.",

Ceftriaxone-associated biliary complications have been described in patients receiving ceftriaxone therapy for unsubstantiated diagnoses of Lyme disease [9]. Inappropriate antimicrobial therapy for Lyme disease has also been associated with septic thrombophlebitis, neutropenia, serum sickness, and antibiotic-associated colitis [7]. Overall, empirical treatment with iv antibiotics of patients with nonspecific chronic fatigue or myalgia, based on positive serological results alone, has been determined to result in many more instances of antibiotic toxicity than cures of atypically symptomatic true Lyme disease [10].\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/cid/article/31/4/1107/374252",

It sounded from OPs post like the dog typically comes home with ticks after walks. Manually removing ticks that are crawling on the dog before they bite the dog isn\u2019t a foolproof strategy because some ticks (nymphs) are super small and you won\u2019t find them on the dog, so they bite and get big like this before you see them. It would be better to use a preventative to repel and/or kill the ticks so that they do not bite the dog or die immediately after biting.",

You can tell that the mandibles are no longer attached, meaning you need to inspect the site of the bite (dogs leg) for the remaining pieces and remove them or it can become infected. \n\nIt also looks like it has been on there for awhile. I believe it takes about 12 hours (don\u2019t quote me) for Lyme disease to be transmitted while the tick is feeding. \n\nAfter the wound is clean, keep an eye on your dog for signs of Lyme disease. It could take a few weeks. Some dogs can carry Lyme and have it never affect them. If you are really cautious about it, wrap the tick in a damp cloth and in a ziplock bag. Put it in the fridge. This way it won\u2019t dry up incase your vet wants to get it tested. \n\nAsk your vet about Bravecto. It\u2019s safe. It will kill any tick that bites your dog. In Ontario I pay about $80 and the pill lasts 3 months. I live in a hot zone and deal with at least 15 ticks a day. \n\nTLDR: ask your vet about Bravecto. Inspect the bite for debris. Disinfect the bite. Store the tick (if vet wants to send it for testing). \n\nNote: before I found out about tick medication, my vet said they don\u2019t really do anything for tick bites until the dog starts showing symptoms. So, look for signs of: fever, loss of appetite, painful or swollen joints, lameness that comes and goes, swollen lymph nodes, and lethargy. (In the next upcoming weeks). It doesn\u2019t hurt to contact your vet if you are concerned. Also, check yourself, sometimes ticks can wander off your pet and onto you.",

The part that sometimes breaks off if you pull too fast is the mouthparts. The mouthparts have backward facing barbs much like a porcupines quill. Goes in easy, hard to remove. They can retract those barbs though. So if you pull slowly the tick will retract the barbs and come off easily. It will do this if you\u2019re patient because it doesn\u2019t want to injure its mouth. The head doesn\u2019t burrow or come off. It just seems that way because we are used to insects who have a separate identifiable head. But ticks aren\u2019t insects. Their eyes are actually way back where youd imagine their second set of \u201cshoulder blades\u201d would be, though they don\u2019t actually have shoulder blades",

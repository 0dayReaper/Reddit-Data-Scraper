I understand they gotta make money somehow but this big tech rug pull is getting REALLY old. Reddit as company has been conducting itself in a frankly appalling manner and a lot of Reddit moderators (who are basically working for Reddit for no pay) will not have the tools they need to effectively moderate their communities (without which this website would be worse than unusable).",

It\u2019s Where they essentially blocked everyone that isn\u2019t following that sub and now only certain actions and viewers can be done/around. Unfortunately there\u2019s a strike performed by the moderators of these subs to fight a ruling that Reddit has made that would take in affect on July. According to what they\u2019re saying this ruling vastly hurts mods on how they can \u201cmod\u201d.  Since you\u2019re subbed here you aren\u2019t experiencing it. But there isn\u2019t any point to write to the other subs to get in because they said they will stop on the 14th\u2026honestly , not these mods but the other subs are a bunch of asshats.",

My guess is they\u2019re different actions which is why you can view/find others and some not. I wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019re following them so I went to worst case scenario.",

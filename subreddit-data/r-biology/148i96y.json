    "postText": "  So I did a lab test an we were trying to measure the Alife yeast cells\n\nAnd the CFU/ml is 1,56\u00d710\\^6. This was calculated in the agar had 156 colonies and the Dilution factor is 10\\^4 so 156 \u00d7 10\\^4=1,56\u00d710\\^6\n\nAnd the yeast cells counted with a Counting chamber, B\u00fcrker-T\u00fcrk. Has 260 000 calculated averages being 26 \u00d710\\^4=260 000 the yeast mixture is an 1g/L\n\nBut when I calculate the Alife yeast cells in the mixture this happened 1,56 \u00d7 10\\^6/230 000\u00d7100=678,26%, this is impossible\n\nam i doing something wrong",

Was this the yeast mixture that was spread on the plate you counted colonies on? This part is very confusing. Do you mean you had 260,000 cells per ml? I don't understand what you mean by 260,000 (unitless number) and then you say yeast is at 1g/ml. One gram of what? What yeast is at 1g/ml? I've never seen someone do cell math and count them by unit mass.",

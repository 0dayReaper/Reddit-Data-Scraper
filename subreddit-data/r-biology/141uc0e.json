    "postText": "Hi,\n\n I graduated from the University of Chicago with a BSc in Evolutionary Biology (2018), and I have TA'd labs (physics) and courses (bio), and informally tutored students in high school.  \n\nI am offering tutoring in college biology, specifically evolutionary biology. This is not a test-prep. I expect my tutoring will improve your scores, but due to increased understanding, and practice.  Ideally over many sessions / hours. I also provide a place to discuss ideas to solidify them.  \n\nIf you are interested, DM me to give me an example of the king of thing / homework / essay / concept you are interested in before booking.",

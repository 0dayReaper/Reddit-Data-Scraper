    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI am currently trying to plan a biomedical related school club. For most biology/pre-med related clubs, I found that most of them simply find people who are willing to host seminars and talk about their career or set up fundraisers and help donate things to the community. While I do plan on having that, I want the club to be more focused on projects. Similar to many technology clubs (Engineering without Border, Data Science Club, EEEI, etc.) where the members would split into different groups to help contribute in developing projects like building a robot or creating a website, etc. I was wondering if there can be something similar that is more biomedical/biology focused? If anyone has any experience on this type of matter, perhaps at their own clubs, etc. that would be great!\n\nAny other request on what you wish your school's biology/biomedical club has would be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "If you like computer based work, there are tons of ways that you can get involved in real biological research online.\n\nMany researchers in the bioscience domain share their research in freely accessible online databases. You can find most of these compiled in [https://www.expasy.org/](https://www.expasy.org/)\n\nI highly recommend to go through the whole thing, to familiarise yourself with different types of data that are available out there because learning to work with any of it can be very beneficial for you later on. This kind of skillset will become very valuable in the future. Some things it includes is tools for drug design, protein design, and stem cell differentiation.\n\nYou can make use of genetic data from there by designing your own genetic sequences. Check out [benchling.com](https://benchling.com) if you're interested in that. You could make projects that are about designing different proteins, that you can then also visualise in a website, or using pymol.\n\nIf you prefer to keep things simpler, there's also stuff like [fold.it](https://fold.it) that's more straight forward and the goal is to create drugs by figuring out puzzles. Perhaps you could turn that into a collaborative effort by the whole club. Let me know if any of these interest you and I can give some further advice",

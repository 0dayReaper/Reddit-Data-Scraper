There is the competition theory which is what you described. There is also the assimilation theory. Basically we are the same species (Homo sapiens) and \u201cNeanderthals\u201d are named that because they were discovered in the Neander Valley. Due to ice segregating this population from other H. sapiens they became very homogeneous but when the ice melted, they became integrated into the general populous. So in essence, under this theory, we are the same species and they were different due to variation (just like we have variation in the human populous today!). It also depends on classifications and how people classify \u201cdifferent\u201d species. Paleo- (anthropology, ontology, etc) is hard in general for classifying different species because it also depends on what theory of species you subscribe to (like the biological species concept or others)!",

It is generally accepted that H. erectus/ergaster was a predecessor to both H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis but there is some debate on if Sapiens and Neanderthals are the same or different species. As I said, it really depends on how you define what a species is and how things are classified. If you subscribe to the assimilation theory, then the two are the same species and differences are due to variation (just like skeletons from different parts of the world today look different from each other). The assimilation theory also hinges on the biological species concept. If you subscribe to the competition theory then it is generally presumed that they were different species. These are simply two competing theories/explanations in the field of (paleo)anthropology regarding human evolution. We obviously will never know and are learning new things constantly!   \n\nAlso, clarifying question, what do you mean all H. sapients and H. neanderthalensis wouldn\u2019t have the same common ancestor? In your comment you said they both can from H. erectus which would make H. erectus their common ancestor?",

It's frustrating",

The creator of the visualization though is reaching a broad, non-scientific audience with nearly 300k followers on IG, so it probably does perpetuate the misconceptions to some extent for those casual public viewers. \n\nI totally respect that you appreciate the visualization though and that there\u2019s probably a good reason the creator of this has amassed such a following (something I will never be able to relate to lol). I teach a college level evolution course and have to tackle a lot of these issues in that course and others. This is magnified by the broad range of preconceptions from prior learning coming into the course, and that\u2019s for biology majors nonetheless, not really the casual public. I get 16 weeks a semester to go over the material with my students, which is obviously much more time than it takes to read a simple poster. So I completely agree with you that it is very complicated to get across to many people and in a fairly efficient manner, which is certainly one component about why this conversation persists more than 150 years later. Frustrating indeed but I love that people are willing to have a level-headed dialogue on how we do advance that understanding more broadly. Cheers :)",

Some individuals may argue that evolution does not adequately explain the complexity and diversity of life on Earth. They may propose alternative explanations, such as intelligent design or the belief in a divine creator.\n\nIt's important to note that the scientific consensus overwhelmingly supports the theory of evolution. The theory is supported by substantial evidence from various scientific fields, including genetics, paleontology, and comparative anatomy. The overwhelming majority of scientists consider evolution to be a well-established scientific theory.\n\nUnderstanding and discussing different perspectives can contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

A few of those probably should not be on there or there is a good argument to show an alternative. I also don't see the synapsid/diapsid split. That one is important. Pretty sure haemoglobin is much earlier. Some of the listed trait changes aren't well conserved. For example the number of mammary glands changes frequently across Mammalia so I wouldn't be surprised if the number went back up a few times...  \n\n\nIn particular I would try to show some creature from the period that has a conserved relative today, show when a few well known species showed up, and when they disappeared.  \n\n\nMaybe a map of how the continents were at different periods and where the species were indicated with colored blobs.",

The recommendation I keep getting is to branch this, and make it tree-like\u2026but I\u2019m struggling with how this solves or says anything about humans without over communicating into irrelevant species. To describe the evolution of life this makes sense, but to look at the lineage humans have come from\u2026why is this necessary?\n\nI sort of likened this to two points on a map. You wouldn\u2019t list every road or turn in a network to see what path was taken to get somewhere. But in this analogy, it seems to be a blasphemous representation. I\u2019m wondering how I can streamline this without sacrificing or misleading the nature of what\u2019s happening here. \n\nThanks I advance!

Not only does the graphic imply destination, and \"imply a ladder of being\", that there is a driving force from simpler to more complex,  and that things like \"prokaryotes\" ing general and cyanobacteria got to a certain point and then stopped evolving, the stepwise view of evolution. Bacteria have been evolving this whole time my friend, and it could be argued they are a hell of a lot smarter than us in certain ways, or at least more efficient and effective communicators.\n\n\nThis idea of protocells is entirely speculative, we still have only wild hand-waving speculations about how life as we know it came about and we don't really know if it or things like it came about more than once. It misses that prokaryotes evolved two entirely different lineages that seem to have recombined into the first eukaryote. Cyanobacteria were not involved at all, although they did recombine a bunch of times with eukaryotes who were NOT our ancestors. Most of the last half of the series is entirely speculative. We have compelling no reason to think, for example, that humans evolved from coelacanths or  that Orrorin was a human ancestor.  Hell, we don't even know that the 20 bone fragments we call Orrorin even all come from the same species! One thing we DEFINITELY know is that humans didn't evolve from neanderthals.\n\n\nWe have no compelling reason to think that the \"great averaging\" will happen, I'd point out people have had relatively good global access to each other for hundreds of years but moving is still hard. It's a simultaneous internationalist fantasy or nationalist scare story depending on who's saying it. Everything else on the future is hand-waving too, why wouldn't they just bring up ACTUAL ONGOING OBSERVABLE human evolution, such as the development of additional arteries in the forearms, a trait that is rapidly spreading.\n\n\nIn short this graphic is complete bullshit. It is lazy, and it pushes",

First, again as has been previously stated, the evolutionary process isn\u2019t at all teleological. This representation makes is appear as though \u201cthese were the steps we took and now we\u2019re here,\u201d when the reality is that there were a multitude of other branches of very similar species taking place at the same time  and sharing the same ancestors throughout the process.\n\nNext, it also seems to suggest that evolution plods along one step at a time, when the reality is that there are often protracted plateaus followed by bursts of rapid development in evolutionary history.\n\nHope this helps.",

There's NO WAY you could actually depict evolution accuratey on a single poster-- that's what textbooks are for.

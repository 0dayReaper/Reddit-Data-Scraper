            "comment": "That depends on what you mean by \"in biology\" and by \"research\"\n\nIf you don't care about your primary field being biology, you can find a lot of jobs with applications that require a strong biology background (or at least should).\n\nLaw: Patent examiners, lawyers, policy makers. These jobs aren't exclusive to biology, but in some cases they can overlap extensively, and its pretty common for people without biology backgrounds to be put in positions where they have to make legal decisions about biology without the proper training. \n\nMedicine: You don't need to do research in medicine but you definitely have to understand biology\n\nEducator: You can provide others with the benefit of your training if you find you have a passion for teaching. \n\nIf by \"research\" you mean coming up with hypothesis and then doing the actual experiments required to test those hypotheses, and not extensively \"researching\" the primary literature.\n\nAuthor: Use your biology knowledge to write \"hard\" sci-fy, or become a ghost writer for university medical labs or industry researchers who will often hire out the actual writing of papers.\n\nIndustrial R&amp;D: Depending on what your particular preferences are, jobs in established industrial research fields can be more about doing the experiments laid out in a project given to you, and not coming up with your own new ideas. This could mean specializing in one technique and running it over and over as an aspect of quality assurance.\n\nAdvisory roles: Be the scientific advisor. For anything from shows on streaming platforms, and movies, to companies making products or involved in investing in new technologies.",

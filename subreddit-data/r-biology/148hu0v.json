Idk bird social norms though, so I could be wrong lmao. You sure it's a real picture?",

I'm honestly more interested in why you put a lens-cap on a potato than what kind of birds those are.  \n\n\nI don't know what you were expecting here, how you thought anyone could possibly tell you anything about those blurry blobs in the distance.  No one is going to look at that and be like \"Those are spotted pelicans, I'd know their blobbiness anywhere!\"   \n\n\nLike, no, those could be trashbags in the wind for all we can tell.  \nWhat a waste of a potato.",

Native to several continents, including Europe and North America, they are generally non-threatening, although their legs contain a hemotoxic irritant venom that can ultimately result in gangrene if not neutralized promptly. \n\nSimilar to other invertebrate venoms, the harmful proteins are rendered inactive by uric acid, hence the age old wisdom of peeing on jellyfish stings, which also applies here.  \n\nIf you've unknowingly let one of these come into contact with bare skin, it is advantageous to pee on yourself immediately.\n\nIf unable to pee on yourself directly, due to the location of the envenomated tissue, it is also acceptable to have your partner accommodate you by peeing on you instead. \n\n[Further information ](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) about A. dorsii biology can be found here.",

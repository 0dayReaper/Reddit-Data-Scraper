    "postText": "**TLDR:** I was shocked today to read that numerous studies show that exercise and heat exposure can cause injury to the intestinal lining.  I suspect this is a \"it's the does that makes the poison\" type situation, but wondering if anyone with a better biology / science background than I have can weigh in on this. \n\n**Notes:**\n\nI have increased intestinal permeability and gastroparesis, and my GI doctor thinks that it's contributing to an autoimmune condition affecting my central nervous system. Exercise is a *huge* deal for me, and it's crucial for stress management. More recently, I've felt amazing after integrating bikram yoga and sauna into my practice (and I feel qualitatively that both have improved my digestion), and I've heard Ronda Patrick talk endlessly about how good sauna is for you. \n\nHowever, while doing some more research on the topic of how to decrease intestinal permeability, I came across some concerning things:\n\n* Studies show that intestinal permeability increases significantly once the exercise stimulus is above eighty percent of maximal oxygen uptake (Pals et al [1997](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9049739/)).\n* It looks like the mechanism by which this happens is that the body directs blood away from the stomach. For instance. Van Wikjn et al ([2012](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpgi.00066.2012?rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&amp;url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org)) found that within ten minutes of going 70% max, cyclists had reduced bloodflow to the stomach. \n* Other studies (e.g., Bulchman [1999](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10319359/)) show that marathon runners experience increased intestinal permeability in spite of the lower intensity of the exercise. This isn't surprising to me, as even slightly reduced blood flow for a long period of time is probably not great.\n* Davison et al 2016 cite a bunch of studies suggesting that similar mechanisms happen in extreme heat exposure.\n* It looks like zinc carnosine can somewhat offset this over a period of time [(Davison et al. 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27357095/)), but I'm confused about what to make of this in practical terms.\n\n*BUT* we've got all these studies that suggest that exercise is good for you:\n\n* I won't bother to cite the generic ones that talk about the anti-inflammatory or cardiovascular benefits, we all know they exist.\n* More interestingly to me, there is a body of evidence that regular physical exercise diminishes BBB permeability as it reinforces antioxidative capacity, reduces oxidative stress and has anti-inflammatory effects. It improves endothelial function and might increase the density of brain capillaries. (Ma\u0142kiewicz et al [2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12974-019-1403-x) lit review)\n   * It's interesting because increased intestinal permeability often contributes to increased permeability of the BBB which is essential to preventing neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nWondering if some scientists can weigh in or add context here!",

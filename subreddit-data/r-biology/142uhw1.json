    "postText": "Due to the ever increasing cost of living, I've been thinking of starting a side hustle to supplement my wage in Biotech. Over the last year or so I've come up with a biotech product that is easy to use that I could sell to consumers. I've come up with a name, sourced my materials, come up with a marketing plan and made instructions on how to use &amp; interpret it. The thing I'm kind of stuck on is the regulatory side of things. I want to make my product in accordance to environmental and health guidelines and regulations in Canada, but I have no legal or regulatory background. I've tried doing research myself but it's very daunting to navigate and find exactly what i need. For the record, for all the components, I only have one or two things that may be slightly hazardous in each product\n   \nI have two questions:\n   \nHas anyone made biotech products in Canada who can point me in the right direction or give advice on these laws/regulations/guidelines? Non-Canadians are welcome to answer this too, just make sure to state your country!\n  \nIf you have advice would you give for someone developing a product in general?\n\nThank you everyone!",

            "comment": "So I'm in the US, but I work for a biotech company (R&amp;D, not regulatory) that submits devices worldwide, including to Health Canada. Just to confirm, this is a healthcare product you are marketing to patients to use? Producers of a product like this faces immense regulatory pressure. Companies spend millions of dollars on clinical trials alone, plus all of the analytical testing that goes into development before you can start trials. I don't know the specific rules you need to follow, but these types of things are done by large teams of trained scientists who are supported by other teams of quality and regulatory staff. It may be easier if it accomplishes a novel task that the regulatory body really wants, but if it only adds a something new in a field that has any other options, they won't try so hard to help you succeed. If I've misunderstood any part of what you said, I will try and revise my answer. Also I don't mean to be discouraging, but I've seen, at least to some extent, what it takes to get stuff like this approved.\n\nEdit: typos",

Basically my product would be DIY test they can complete at home instead of getting/paying for a lab req. Think of it like a Rapid Antigen Test. The public can use it to help them assess their condition, but it doesn't replace diagnostic lab testing. Kind of like a piece-of-mind test.\n  \nI am veering far away from anything that would be used in a clinical or research setting as I'd like to minimize stress from any regulatory bodies haha\n  \nThank you for your response. You seem very knowledgeable and I greatly appreciate your expertise!",

There is additional challenge selling to patients instead of clinicians or diagnostics labs because the pros can be expected to have trained staff to operate the device and interpret the results. You have to prove patient use devices are 100% fool proof, even in the hands of someone who has no idea what they're doing. This will go through the same regulatory rigor as covid home antigen tests or similar. It's easier (still very hard) if it pertains to a public health emergency, called emergency use authorization in the US. Even more difficult if you have to submit for a full approval.\n\nMy knowledge is still quite superficial unfortunately, but I'm learning! Happy to share what I know.",

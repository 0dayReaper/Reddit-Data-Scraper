It then \"throws the lever,\" so to speak, on the proper automatic process to get the job done.\n\nEven something like language, which we have to learn, has deep roots in our DNA. Learn language all you want, but damage a specific area in your brain, and you'll lose your ability to speak. You'll be able to think, and you'll understand people no problem, but the link between your brain and your mouth is gone. \n\nDamage a different area, and the ability to process language is gone. You'd be able to tell people that they're speaking gibberish, and they'd be confused. To them, and everyone else, it's normal language. \n\nNeither of these brain structures are learned patterns. They grow because our DNA somehow tells them to. Hell, if you get right down to it, you can call in to question whether even that little bit at the front is anything more than an automatic process, designed to feel like it has free will to help avoid existential terror.",

One day, a mutation caused one to use the fibers it cocoons itself with to pull a less than ideal leaf into a good shape, extending the range of leaves it can use. Then, another mutation caused one to eat in a pattern that helped what was now an almost good leaf to bend into the right shape. So on and so forth, until the critter no longer needs a preshaped leaf and can do it with whatever they find.\n\nAs for the pleated corners, thats just pure black magic and definitely proof of alien intervention. Jokes aside, I think the pleated corners are a good example of a common fallacy of evolution. We humans want to think things are intentional and designed, and that sort of language has creeped in when we talk about evolution, but what we fail to see are the 99.9999999999% of mutations that fail, often horrifically. We never saw the untold iterations that snipped the leaf into a bad shape, or pulled the leaf over too tightly and trapped itself, or even had a mutation that had nothing to do with this mechanism. Nature isn't \"trying\" anything, it's just throwing every possible combination of atoms and molecules that it possibly can at the wall to see what sticks. It doesn't even have to be blatantly advantageous, as long as it allows better reproductive fitness. \n\nAnyway, my point was that while the corners seem too perfect to be an accident, that's probably pretty much exactly what they were. Hell, they might have evolved first, when the species was still using pre-shaped leaves, helping extend the range of viable ones. Sadly, all we can really do is guess, and there are plenty of other paths these bugs could have taken to reach this point.",

I believe a complex skill like this would arise from simpler tasks that were beneficial working in tandem. So first, the caterpillar eats leaves for energy, and there may be some selective benefit for eating leaves in a line as opposed to chunks at a time (maybe eating chunks keeps them still longer and they become more likely prey, or maybe eating in a line would accidentally create shelter when the wind blew or something).  Basically there\u2019s also benefits to the partial behavior that allow selection to occur and then based on that the more complex behavior to develop. It\u2019s not an all or nothing phenomenon.\n\nHumans didn\u2019t evolve to become bipedal and use tools just so that we could chase down prey and kill it with spears - there were individual benefits to bipedalism and tool use that grew in tandem",

    "postText": "I do not understand why online sources (maybe I haven't found the right literature yet) say that long telomere is bad. If there was a drug or treatment that can maximize telomerase activity and make huge repeats of telomere, how does that relate to higher cancer risk? I understand that a lot of cancers have high telomerase activity to sustain their uncontrolled divisions, but that doesn't mean high telomerase activity leads to cancer. its the mutation in protooncogenes that make cancers cancers, and yeah I guess having a long telomere would make the cancer happier to start with, but I don't think the odds of mutation depends on the length of telomere. Theoretically, if we can activate telomerase activity to the max, we wont have a population with more cancer, but the same rate of cancer development and being less aged. Am I wrong to think this?",

            "comment": "it's thought to act as a kind of timer to put a limit on cell division, which is why most human cells can only divide about 50 times before they can't anymore. On the other end, one way to immortalize cells (important in making cell lines) is by reactivating telomerase so this cap is lifted and they can keep dividing forever. Of course, a problem with this is they can accumulate tons of genetic anomalies over time, which mirrors what happens with cancer.\n\nFor one a lot of human cells do not divide or should not be dividing anyway, and the theory from my understanding is a limit on telomere length can provide protection if a mutation were to occur. If this happened and the cell divides aggressively when it's not supposed to, the telomere would shorten each time and eventually would cause the cells to stop dividing when the limit is reached. So in this way having short telomeres can be cancer protective, while long telomeres would give more opportunities for mutations to creep in every cell division to possibly reactivate telomerase. You can imagine with uncontrolled cell growth and with more and more cell cycle protections being lifted mutations can snowball easily this way.",

Higher telomerase just makes it more likely that the cancer will progress more.\n\n&gt; Theoretically, if we can activate telomerase activity to the max, we wont have a population with more cancer, but the same rate of cancer development and being less aged. \n\nReasonable, but there is some hand-waving there.\n\nWe don't know how much hi-telomerase would benefit aging.\n\nRemember, natural selection probably doesn't care much about aging. It cares about leaving kids.",

                    "comment": "Regarding natural selection caring about having kids, not aging: \n\nAlthough Drosophila uses a different chromosome end capping mechanism to humans (transposable element-sourced etc) the principle functionality is conserved. \n\nYears ago Rose et al. selected long-lived populations by preventing mating until later in the life cycle of each successive generation and ended up with remarkably long-lived cohorts. It\u2019d be interesting to see the telomere-related gene expression patterns in those subsequent generations that are long-lived yet fertile.\n\nGiven that I\u2019d say natural selection can be linked to ageing at least indirectly by favouring fecundity after more cell division cycles. (The entire argument sidesteps when gametogemesis occurs in an organism anyway).\n\nJust something I found interesting.",

Hence it is not obvious what would happen if we had more telomeres, or even just more (healthy) aging.\n\nSuggest that the Rose expt be repeated in humans.",

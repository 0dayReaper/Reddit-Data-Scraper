Most of my dreams are reliving childhood memories or making love to someone. Also the odd nightmare but i immediately become lucid.\n\nThe mind's eye is basically like a watered down lucid dream and different people have different intensities. I can for example have imaginary battles in my head with myself as some sort of superhuman in great detail if i listen to good music. My friend for example only sees foggy images as he puts it.\n\nHe is far from stupid, he is a math genius and pretty much breezed through school and college and now runs his own business so lacking a mind's eye or voice has nothing to do with intelligence.",

Inner monologue isn't some disembodied voice that pops in and talks to you, it's your thoughts.\n\nImagining something doesn't require picture like images either. I'm not a visual thinker, but if you ask me to imagine a pig with 8 legs i can draw one.",

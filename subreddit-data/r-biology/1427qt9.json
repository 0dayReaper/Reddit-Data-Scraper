            "comment": "Not all carbs are considered sugar. But all sugars are carbs. Carbs can exist in long chains like starches and these are generally better as your body breaks them down and this won\u2019t spike your blood sugar levels as it\u2019s slower. That being said your body will break down the starch into individual sugar monomers called glucose. But the reason why sugar is often considered \u201cbad\u201d is in like desserts, candy or soft drinks as the amount you get is extremely high and readily absorbed. It\u2019s not awful in low doses or if your being physically active and need a quick burst of energy but if your being a couch potato you don\u2019t need energy at those high levels while being sedentary. Your body has to use that sugar or store it and because it doesn\u2019t need it it will be stored in muscle and as fat for long term storage.",

                            "comment": "Refined sugars are usually derived from things like cane sugar and are isolated into the most simplest of sugars. There are many forms of sugar such as glucose, sucrose, lactose, dextrose etc. but all of which are just too easy for the body to convert into energy. Kinda like having to walk to a store versus someone driving you there. its convenient but comes at a cost of your health. There actually isn't a terrible amount of sugar in hamburgers or pizza per se but it lacks many nutrients and high in calories so its bad in other ways. So in the end the refined sugars are the same sugars your body would get from say starch from potatoes which are healthy but it is digested at a more steady rate that doesnt cause blood sugar spikes and energy storage. Not to mention tooth decay, other microbiotic changes in the gut etc.",

I know it definitely has to do with the **rate** the sugar is absorbed.\n\nYour body uses energy over time. There\u2019s a roughly set \u2018output **rate**\u2019.\n\nIf you have 100kJ  of some slow release energy, that doesn\u2019t affect the rate as much as 100kJ of fast release energy all at once. Massive simplification, but it\u2019s meant to show that the form of the substance matters just as much as the pure energy total. I think the term GI refers to the \u201cglycemic index\u201d of foods which is related to how fast the body breaks it down into sugar or something. So low GI food is generally healthier.\n\nI know that food science is hard af because there\u2019s many variables, which is why food advice can appear to change frequently. But the simpler core messages have stayed true. Avoid lots of sweet and fatty things, exercise etc. I\u2019ll reply to you with some handy links",

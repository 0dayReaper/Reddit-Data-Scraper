    "postText": "Why does Japan have monkey species that live in very cold and snowy mountain areas while other temperate climates with plenty of forest and hot summers like appalachia, new england, the american south, and europe lack native monkey species. After googling around it says that primates are only able to live in tropical climates except for Japan for some reason. Is this a case of isolated survivors like how lions used to live across eurasia but now only live in tropical regions and small isolated pockets still exist in eurasia or is it something else. Why are monkeys only able to live in temperate regions of Japan and not elsewhere?",

            "comment": "I believe you're specifically talking about Japanese macaques? If so, it's a really fun reason actually and probably worth 10 minutes or so pursuing the little rabbit hole about it on Wikipedia. Long story short however, Japanese macaques use Japan's natural hot springs produced by its volcanic activity to stay warm, in order to compensate for the climate of the mountains that these hot springs are in otherwise not suiting them particularly well. Therefore I think the high altitude and inaccessibility of these mountains provides the macaques the protection from predation they need and would otherwise lack in standard temperature forests that do not have enough of a canopy for the macaques and other monkeys to live in.",

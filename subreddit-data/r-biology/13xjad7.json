    "postText": "Hello all! I recently changed most of my academic path around in order to try to become a scientific journalist. Right now, my minor is biology and my major is journalism. I\u2019m really passionate about environmental biology and sustainability in particular, and want to know how to make my passion/dream a reality. \n\nWith that being said, what advice would this subreddit have? Any and all is appreciated!! \n\nThank you :)",

            "comment": "Honestly, I'd say you'd probably do better by switching your major and minor, or doing a double major. Skillful writing is like art; more a product of practice than anything classes can give you. One of the biggest problems in science journalism today is lack of scientific literacy in the journalists. They'll see a research paper and not have the necessary scientific grounding to fully understand what it says. Then when they try to \"translate\" it for their audience, they wind up misrepresenting it. Having the necessary background to be able to actually understand primary research literature and simplify it for a lay audience is probably the most important aspect of what you're hoping to do. In order to do that, you'll need to have a very broad background in various aspects of biology, unless your goal is to focus on one specific field like zoology or microbiology. I don't think having biology only as a minor will give you the exposure you'd need to excel as a scientific journalist.",

    "postText": "Hi, I am a neuroscience research intern and am a little confused about a genetic model of mice that our lab studies.\n\nWe have a few mouse lines that we study, one is a global knock-out of a gene that encodes for a receptor. This gene is of high implication for ASD and other psychiatric diseases. We have also begun studying knock-in genetic manipulation. According to my PI, knocking-in this gene makes the receptor still intact in our mouse models, but it is not functional. The receptor is important for synaptic scaffolding so you can see why studying a non-functional but still intact version of this receptor would be of interest. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy confusion here is that we have the heterozygotes (KI +/-) and the homozygotes (KI +/+). I have not taken biology in forever and the internet hasn't been super helpful. Can someone explain this to me in simple terms? What does it mean in terms of the offspring and reproduction of these mouse models? How \"affected\" might each of the two mouse models be?",

In my situation, this is a mouse model that has never been created before, and so would this be beneficial to determine if this is a recessive trait? What are the benefits or purpose of using hetero- and homozygous mouse models in this situation?",

They\u2019re going to be very specific to the gene of interest, because they all work slightly differently. \n\nUnless someone who knows that gene really well happens by, you\u2019re probably going to have to keep digging into the literature to figure it out.",

Genetically:\n\n- A or B individuals can be AA/A0, BB/B0. They express just a single protein (A or B)\n\n- AB ones must to be AB. Both proteins are expressed.\n\n- 0 ones have to be 00. There is not protein expressed.",

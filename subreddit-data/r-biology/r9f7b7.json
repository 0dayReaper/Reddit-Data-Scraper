            "comment": "I've seen blue ring octopi in the wild, on the mudflats of Lembeh strait. Size is spot on for the two I saw. They aren't so friendly, usually avoiding noisy scuba divers, scuttling into refuges like cans and coconut husks. \n\nAnd at depth, the skin appears dark brown, interrupted by the rings. Even under flash photography.",

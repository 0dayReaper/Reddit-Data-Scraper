    "postText": "Me and my family are currently in Puerto Rico. First time out of continental US. Back home we have a small in-ground hot tub and we\u2019re used to having to help bugs and sometimes even small rodents get out before they drown.\n\nToday, I saw this little guy seemingly struggling in the pool. I went to help him out and he was surprisingly non-resistant. When I went to set him down he even initially went further up my hand.\n\nWe were worried the wind might blow him in again so we tried to scoop him up to put somewhere else a little further away. He instead jumped out of the way back into the pool. When we went to get him, he swam down, skillfully enough that it looked like he was used to it. We\u2019ve seen iguanas around here and I know some (if not all) of those can swim, but this guy didn\u2019t look like an iguana.\n\nWe got him out a second time, carried him over to the bushes a few meters away, offered him some shredded carrots (which we still left out after he left), and watched as he darted away on his hind legs like a basilisk or something.\n\nWe were curious if he was ok in the water earlier or not. It was chlorinated so we figured it was safer to take him out since idk if that\u2019s safe.\n\nI thought maybe it was some kind of gecko. He was a little slimy to the touch, and his back legs were much larger than his fronts, as well as being built like those of a frog. His toes looked like those of a webbed creature, but he didn\u2019t have any webbing between them.",

It could\u2019ve been the way the light reflected off his scales or smth in the water. She said he looked more like purple while in pool. He certainly looked darker to me from my distance.",

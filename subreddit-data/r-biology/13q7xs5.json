            "comment": "Actually, I\u2019m fairly certain that is a carpet beetle larvae. Looks fuzzy and doesn\u2019t have the characteristic antennae of an isopod. Pretty common to find inside and there are many species. They tend to feed on stray crumbs and whatnot where I live. Nothing to really be worried about, the beetles are tiny. But it might be a good idea to clean any food waste out of the kid\u2019s room and try to make sure he doesn\u2019t leave scraps of food around. \n\nThat said, Carpet beetles tend to show up in small numbers anyway. Hard to eradicate their food sources entirely because they\u2019ll munch on everything from other dead beetles to trace amounts of dead skin.",

From what I remember they got the name carpet beetle from the fact that they ate wool carpets.\n\nThe little \"hairs\" that come off after this stage can be an irritant to lungs, skin, but if it's just one and your kids aren't having issues you should be good.",

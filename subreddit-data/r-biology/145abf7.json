    "postText": "So I graduated with a BS in Biology back in 2019 with plans to attend medical school. My GPA wasnt all that great so I decided to get a masters of arts degree in biomedical science to improve my GPA to help me get accepted to medical school. I applied to medical school twice and got rejected both times, then I applied to optometry because I thought the field was interesting and because I thought I had a chance of getting accepted but I ended up getting denied yesterday. I feel devastated and so defeated I am literally at rock bottom and I dont know what to do with my life. I dont have alot of lab experience, or any experience at all because I dedicated these past few years to getting into either medical/optometry school but I failed :( I feel like I have wasted so much time but I dont want to give up. I have a bachelors in biology and masters of arts in biomedical science and was wondering, what can I do with these degrees? I literally have no clue, any help would be much appreciated!!! Thank you! I am in the US btw.",

Alternatively, you could search for graduate jobs in these fields online (I don\u2019t recommend Indeed, though). \n\nYou could also try to apply for internships or apprenticeships, which may lead to a secure job placement (I know a few people who did this for Public Health and got into consultant positions in the first 6 months, with only an undergrad degree).\n\nIf you\u2019re NOT in the UK, then I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t be of much help. I still suggest looking at those sites for the types of jobs you can apply for\u2026",

A nurse practitioner basically does what a family doctor does, you can even specialize in fields.\n\nI think a lot people get stuck in the idea that they need to go to med school or they need to be a doctor when there are options out there that are just as good and similar to what they want.\n\nYou need to get at the core of what you really want to do with your life. What would make you happy.\n\nBeing in health care is a service based industry. You need to be tactful and good with people. You need to be understanding and compassionate to your patients everyday and happy to engage with them, every day. Sometimes 50+ people a day. If you don't enjoy that, you won't enjoy being a health care provider.\n\nIf you like working in small teams and focusing on scientific projects. Planning your own work and producing results. If you enjoy writing data driven reports. Then working in a lab may be right for you.\n\nWhen I was younger I thought I wanted to be a doctor because I thought helping people was a noble thing to do. But the truth is your patients will probably not heed your advice and you can only help those that want to help themselves. If you specialize most of your patients will be terminally sick and there will be many patients you can't help; many patients that are dying. I'm sure there are moments that make it all worth it. And certain specialties are more positive than others (sports medicine vs oncology)\n\nI realized I didn't have the emotional stamina or social energy to be a health care professional. I love working in the labs though.",

In the end, by happenstance, a Podiatrist showed him what podiatrist do, helping patients to get well.  After that, he applied to Podiatry schools, got accepted and made it to become a Podiatrist, fulfilling his passion to serve.  In short, keep your faith and consider alternatives such as what ChatGPT responded as below: \n\n\"there are several career paths that are currently in demand in the United States. While the demand for specific jobs can vary over time, here are a few fields that often have opportunities:  \nBiotechnology and Pharmaceutical Industry: The biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors are continually growing and offer a range of career opportunities. Jobs in these fields can include research scientists, laboratory technicians, quality control analysts, regulatory affairs specialists, and clinical research associates.  \nHealthcare and Medical Research: Although you mentioned being rejected by medical schools, there are various other roles within healthcare and medical research that may align with your qualifications. You could explore positions as a research scientist, biomedical researcher, clinical research coordinator, or medical writer.  \nBiomedical Engineering: With your background in biomedical science, you might consider a transition into the field of biomedical engineering. This field combines engineering principles with medical sciences to develop and improve medical devices, prosthetics, imaging systems, and other healthcare technologies.  \nData Science and Bioinformatics: The demand for professionals skilled in data analysis and bioinformatics is on the rise. These roles involve utilizing computational methods to analyze and interpret biological and medical data, contributing to areas such as genomics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine.  \nPublic Health and Epidemiology: Public health has gained significant importance, especially in light of recent global events. Positions in public health agencies, nonprofit organizations, or research institutions can involve epidemiology, health policy, health education, and disease surveillance.  \nEnvironmental Science and Conservation: There is a growing need for professionals who can address environmental challenges and promote sustainability. Careers in environmental science and conservation can involve research, monitoring, policy development, and environmental consulting.  \nRemember that exploring job opportunities in these fields may require additional training, certifications, or specialized knowledge. It's also beneficial to stay updated with the current trends and developments in your area of interest. Networking, gaining practical experience through internships or volunteering, and further education, if feasible, can enhance your chances of securing a desired position.\"",

Apparently,  having field experience will help and if your heart is set on medical care, this is a way to discover if it is really something you love.  Take a step back.  Reassess your application.

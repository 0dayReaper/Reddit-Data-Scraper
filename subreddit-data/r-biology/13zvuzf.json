            "comment": "Like the other guy said, it\u2019s an ink cap, specifically(*c. atramentaria*)\n\nIt contains a compound that increases sensitivity to ethanol, which can do a variety of things, including frequent vomiting, dizziness and confusion. Extreme doses of this chemical can induce convulsions.\n\nFun fact, some species of inkcap explode when touched. True to its name, it is very difficult to get out of clothes. I definitely didn\u2019t touch an unknown mushroom on a hike and got goo on my face.",

There are many species of ink cap and while some may be edible others may not",

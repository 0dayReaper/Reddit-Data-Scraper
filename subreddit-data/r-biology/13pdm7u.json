    "postText": "Hey everyone, I hope you\u2019re all enjoying life. I just have a simple question about animals. As you all know, worms tend to get themselves into life threatening situations during and after rain storms. Because of this, whenever I see a worm on the footpath or in the road, I try my best to relocate them to a greener area. Sometimes though, I worry that one\u2019s for which I don\u2019t know their species, that they may have a defense mechanism or two that would hurt me in some way. Are there any worms, in any country you know of, that I should identify before touching?",

Flatworms are flat (shockingly), with very simple eye spots in the front of their head. Nudibranchs look like slugs (because they are both mollusc gastropods), so they are chunkier, usually with colorful bumps on their body and very visible amd colorful gills in the posterior part of their body (their name literally means \"nude gills\").\n\nEdit: and nudibranchs are only marine, so you don't have to worry about finding those out on the sidewalk.",

The typical Danger worm is about an inch long, but if asked is at least 8. Sometimes carrying disease, become enlarged at random and inopportune times. Despite their ugly and grotesque shape, shrines and pictures can be found everywhere, especially the Holly halls of bathroom stall walls. When surprised by one, a swift blow to their lower half will lay them low.",

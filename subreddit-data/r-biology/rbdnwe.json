As someone already mentioned, you can do this same activity by spitting into a test tube and collecting your own DNA. I\u2019ve also done it with a banana. Want to do this at home? Gently swish some salt water in your mouth. This will collect cells. Spit into a glass. Add a tiny drop of detergent. Gently stir. The detergent will break open the cells, releasing the DNA. Slowly pour cold rubbing alcohol down the side of the tilted glass. The DNA should become visible at the interface between the soapy water &amp; alcohol. It will look like white threads with air bubbles trapped in it.\n\nOMG! My very first awards after all these years!! Thank you so very much!!",

XXY for example, exists as a phenotypic spectrum. So one person with 47 chromosomes may look totally normal while the one next to them may look obviously abnormal. I have 47 chromosomes. Diagnosed Non-Mosaic KS47XXY via amniocentesis. I\u2019m on the more severe side of this spectrum and if someone knows what the growth characteristics are, I\u2019d probably stick out like a sore thumb. I\u2019m not sure how uncommon other sex chromosome variations are, but I do know that XXY is the most common sex variation abnormality to date, and is rather common in occurrence altogether. Over the last 30 years, the probability went from 1/1000 male births to 1/500-1/600 roughly. This is because scientific research is advancing at such a fast rate, since the discovery of sex chromosome variations, however it is also suspected that 75% of the men born with 1 or more extra sex chromosomes go undiagnosed entirely or don\u2019t find out until problems arise as they try to father their own children later on in life. If 75% of males with 47 chromosomes go undiagnosed, the likelihood of having more than 2 sex chromosomes is probably much more common than we originally hypothesized. Then we have the female counterpart, Trisomy X (XXX) and things like Down\u2019s Syndrome, XXYXX, XXXYXX, etc. \n\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see just how many people actually have more than 46 chromosomes and whether or not we should rethink what the \u201cNorm\u201d is as science becomes more and more advanced throughout the upcoming decades. I imagine we may be rethinking what the majority norms are. As you stated, it\u2019ll be very interesting to see what personalized DNA medicine, and more affordable DNA sequencing reveals as advancements are made.",

If you can get sterile plastic spatulas (lab-grade, not kitchen) or sterile tongue depressors you can GENTLY scrape the inside of your cheek and gather some of your own cells to separate out. Then, depending on your age and lab equipment access you can then do what\u2019s called a PCR. It stands for Polymerase Chain Reaction. It will essentially amplify (duplicate) the DNA \ud83e\uddec so you can see it. This would help you learn about DNA gel electrophoresis and/or DNA sequencing, maybe even sequence your own DNA!! It\u2019s really interesting to sequence your own DNA.\n\nI\u2019m a microbiologist and taught math &amp; science for 10 years. Seeing young people interested in science and DNA is AMAZING!! The way cells work is fascinating. The information stored on something you can\u2019t see blows my mind.",

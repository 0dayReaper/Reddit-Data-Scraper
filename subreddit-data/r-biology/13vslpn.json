    "postText": "I recently inherited a bunch of 0.22 micron vacuum membrane filters from an alumni in my lab. The general lab policy is that we reuse these membrane filters until they go bad. However, I have no idea what my alumni used those membrane filters for. Is there a way for me to just repurpose those entirely?",

Id take a small sample, un whatever buffer you\u2019ll be using through it (don\u2019t drop below pH 4 or above 8), autoclave it, and then sample it from flow and contamination. It\u2019s a lot of effort vs ordering new but money is money.",

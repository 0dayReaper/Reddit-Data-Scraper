Then the planet earth series and the blue planet series have no competition. They literally spend a decade filming them\u2026 Anything pre 2000s the video quality is pretty bad by todays standards, appreciate the cultural significance those earlier documentaries have but be aware a lot of the scientific content is outdated and the filming and storytelling is very poor compared to more modern productions. There are several good documentaries that follow one particular species, but it would be unfair to call a documentary about an octopus \u201cthe best animal documentary in history\u201d.",

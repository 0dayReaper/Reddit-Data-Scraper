    "postText": "I know that the vast majority of bone mass is gained in childhood and adolescence, and that the rate at which the body builds new bone tissue slows down the later into your 20s you get. \n\nI also know that the body responds to stress placed on bones by remodeling and thickening the bones, particularly during the crucial growing years during adolescence. Hence the importance of weight-bearing exercise and good nutrition. But most of the literature I can find stresses this process happening during childhood and early adulthood, but not so much during mid adulthood. \n\nLooking for information on this, I'm mostly finding things that say the rate at which you build bone tissue is slower than the rate at which you break it down after about 30-35 years of age. \n\nSo are we doomed to play a game of just trying not to loose too much bone mass to fast after 30, or is body still able to actually thicken bones in response to the forces exerted on them by exercise? \nAssuming the body in question is otherwise healthy, not lacking in any nutrition, and has a history of being physically active.",

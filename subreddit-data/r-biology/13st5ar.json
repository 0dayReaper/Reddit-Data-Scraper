Mayflies, for example, which belong to the appropriately-named Ephemeroptera order, can live for several years as nymphs but, like the regal moth, only have vestigial mouthparts once mature, don't feed, and live for but a very short period of time after they've emerged. In some extreme cases, the adult females of certain species will survive only for a matter of minutes. \n\nNature can be both beautiful and cruel.",

They have two small, adjacent pale spots on each of their forewings, with brown perimeters, and another on each of their hind wings. They also generally have a fairly horizontal brown line that runs across all four wings, with the portion of wing below it occasionally filled in. Additionally, their bodies are normally mottled in the same colors as their wings.\n\nhttps://bugguide.net/node/view/4757/bgimage\n\nRegal moths, on the other hand, are not mottled; with brownish-grey forewings that have bright orange stripes radiating outwards, and multiple beige spots (with no contrasting borders). Their hind wings are usually much harder to see but, when exposed, are almost entirely orange, with just a hint of grey and some beige along their upper margins (though this is almost never shown when they're at rest). Their abdomens have very conspicuous orange and beige horizontal stripes. \n\nhttps://bugguide.net/node/view/3559/bgimage\n\nThese characteristics really do matter when attempting to ID a species and, although I'm no saturniid expert, I'm quite certain that the moth pictured above belongs to the Citheronia genus and not to that of the Eacles moths.",

Who needs sci-fi and aliens when we have these little fascinating weirdos under every rock and cranny. The majority cause no harm to us and are even essential to human existence. Like you say, insects are so often the entry point into science and nature appreciation for many. For me, it was insects and salamanders! \n\nEdit: I\u2019m currently getting really into bees, wasps and butterflies/moths. Having fun this summer learning to ID and see new species.\n\nEdit2: can also recommend r/awwnverts for those inclined (or for those with insect/spider phobias who would like some safe exposure).",

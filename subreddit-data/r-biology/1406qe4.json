The parents are likely nearby and keeping a close eye on it. If you're worried about it getting hurt by foot traffic, you can move the fledgling off of the road. But it will most likely be okay if you don't. \nOtherwise just make sure to keep your pets indoors or on a leash so they don't hurt the birds.",

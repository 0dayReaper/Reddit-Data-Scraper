    "postText": "I'm currently in the middle of studying biology/cellbiology and among the material we've received there's a question asking about how a process in metabolism (e.g glycolysis) can be non-spontaneous. I've been looking far and wide in our books and done some net searching but can't seem to find a proper answer (or maybe I'm just not entirely following it well enough as english isn't my first language).\n\nThe only thing I've picked up is that it's *probably* related to thermodynamics and gibbs free energy, but i'm not entirely sure - so I figured I could give reddit a try and see if someone could explain it a bit, whether it's just a general perspective or majorly dumbing it down.\n\nThank you in advance!",

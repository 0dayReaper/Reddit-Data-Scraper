I read answers on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/ssqan4/why_do_coffees_make_me_sleepy/) question but I am not convinced it's because of ADHD. Also, I get a little buzzed on non-alcoholic beer. Don't know if they are related",

I don't remember exactly why this happens only that it is related to how cafeine molecules interacts with the brain juice.\n\nThe buzz from non-alcoholic beer probably comes from the social aspect of drinking it + knowing what the alcohol buzz actually is. Basically placebo. Especially effective if the non-alcohol beer tastes and smells equal to beer.",

Caffeine calms predominantly all people with adhd and doesn't overly \"hype\" us. This is a nice distinguishing factor. Usually have very impulsive or non impulsive differences, I'm tidy he's not,  other widely different things. While we can both have a highly caffeinated beverage - he might get tired but I am relaxed meaning it acts a depressant for both.  CPTSD and ADHD can be very very similar to the point of both being the exact same results even with caffeine the major difference is background of abuse vs non background of abuse. More than that - you can control your behaviors and not let a diagnoses become you. If you want to be more tidy and strive to do so do it for 5 min and grow from there (5 min 10 min etc.). If caffeine is the only thing you have an issue with - (for instance) I love ginger stuff but am allergic to ginger so no pumpkin pie, Dr. Pep, or so many etc. Meaning - just don't.  Unless you want to feel tired.",

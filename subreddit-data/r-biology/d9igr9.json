Which is amazing and shows how important the sun is for all life even if only indirectly. \n\n&gt;That aside, your fundamental hiccup (which, i mean, doesn't deserve -10ish downvotes, let's ignore those) seems to be the qualia behind it all, whether or not it feels similar to dreaming from the inside.\n\nQuite the opposite actually. I don't think it makes any sense to talk about the qualia of a cephalopod if we don't even know how they arise in our own species. My point is that dreaming seems to serve a specific purpose different from sleeping (e.g. ordering of memory, imagining possible scenarios for the future etc.) which I am fairly certain C. elegans is not capable of. I am not saying that octopi are not capable of that!\n\n&gt; This is like the whole argument about emotions in animals. I think the \"yes it looks like emotions, but they lack the brain or whatever to feels real emotions\" really slowed down research on animal behavior a lot.\n\nI am also not discouraging the research on that front. That would be a very interesting thing to know! It is very possible that they dream and that dreaming is a trait that all animals with higher cognitive capabilities evolve over time. I am just saying that we currently have no way of knowing whether they do or don't.",

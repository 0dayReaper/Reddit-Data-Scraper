    "postText": "Integrins are transmembrane proteins that basically act like hooks that grab onto the extracellular matrix and allow the cells to stick to. In this video, each blue dot is a cluster of integrin molecules localised on structures known as endosomes. They are being trafficked back and forth from the front of the cell (the left hand side). This front is called a cell protrusion and integrins are being transported here to allow the cell to grab onto the extracellular fibres (not visible here) to move forwards. It's also important to note that this cell here is sitting in a 3D matrix rather than a flat 2D surface. Blocking integrins can impede cell shape and migration, and you can see this in one of my older video. ",

When it reproduces the eggs will also contain a certain amount of nicotine acting as a deterrent from predators. Im not too sure about this so maybe look into it a bit yourself. Its an really interesting relationship.\n\nI just noticed this isnt really what you were asking for but its the closest thing I knew, maybe it helps anyways",

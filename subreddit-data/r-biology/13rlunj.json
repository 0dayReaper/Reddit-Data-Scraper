    "postText": "Hi all! I want to go to PT school after undergrad and I\u2019m trying to decide which Biological science concentration I should take up at my university.\nThe options are 1. Biochemistry and cellular and molecular biology concentration.\n2. Ecology and evolutionary biology concentration.\n3. Microbiology concentration.\nThere are a couple more but they arnt anything I\u2019m interested in since they\u2019ll vary from anything PT oriented.\nI want to pick up a minor in anatomy in addition to my major. I\u2019m good at bio but when it comes to complex chem I start to struggle. I understand all 3 could work but I\u2019m looking for the best option.\nAll input is welcome, thanks",

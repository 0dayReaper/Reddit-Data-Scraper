You just have to accept that... I felt like how you did for a long time, but it wasn't going to stop at chemistry, or philosophy, religion, biology, psychology, history, etc etc etc.... bc the answer doesn't exist, it would've been a never ending search. If you haven't already, read the alchemist, and see how you relate to the English Man. \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95",

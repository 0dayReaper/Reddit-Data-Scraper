I know natural selection and all but in a porcupine case pe, how did they develop spikes so big they would be safe from bigger predator?

It's kind of like having a book (your DNA) where the words (the genetic code) don't change, but you can add notes in the margin (epigenetic marks) that affect how the book is read.\r  \n\r  \nOne of the main ways this happens is through a process called methylation, where a methyl group (a small chemical tag) is added to the DNA molecule. When a gene is methylated, it generally becomes less active, or \"turned off.\"\r  \n\r  \nAn example of this is honeybees. All worker bees are genetically identical, but some develop into foragers that leave the hive to collect pollen and nectar, while others stay behind as nurse bees to take care of the larvae. What causes these differences? It's not their genes because those are the same. Instead, it's epigenetic changes that \"turn on\" or \"off\" certain genes, leading to these different roles.  \n\n\nAnother example involving humans is the Dutch Hunger Winter.  \nThe Dutch Hunger Winter was a severe famine that occurred in the Netherlands during World War II, from the winter of 1944 to the spring of 1945. This tragic event provides a historical example of how severe environmental stress can lead to epigenetic changes.  \nResearchers studied individuals who were in the womb during the famine and found that they had higher rates of health problems like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease later in life compared to individuals who weren't exposed to the famine in utero. Interestingly, these health effects even appeared to extend to the next generation.  \nWhen scientists looked at the DNA of these individuals, they found epigenetic changes in the form of altered DNA methylation patterns in certain genes associated with growth and metabolism. These changes were likely caused by the extreme nutritional stress experienced during early development and might explain the increased risk of health problems.  \n\n\nhttps://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0806560105",

            "comment": "Your question is absolutely valid. Understanding how evolution works can be quite complex, especially when considering specific traits like a porcupine's quills.\r  \n\r  \nFirst, let's make it clear: porcupines didn't just suddenly grow spikes because predators were around. Rather, we can think of it as a very slow process involving small changes over a very long period of time. They probably had ancestors with some kind of basic defence mechanism, perhaps tougher fur or small spikes. Due to a lucky mutation, some of them might have developed harder or sharper fur, giving them a bit of an advantage against predators.\r  \n\r  \nThese lucky few would have a higher chance of surviving and passing on their genes to the next generation, creating more porcupines with slightly better fur. Over many generations, with many more small changes and a lot of natural selection, this \"better fur\" could eventually turn into the full-blown spikes that we see today.\r  \n\r  \nAs for Lamarck's theory, while it did suggest that individuals could adapt to their environment during their lifetime and pass those adaptations to their offspring, it doesn't hold up to what we know today about genetics and evolution. For example, a bodybuilder can't pass on their muscles to their child, because these changes are not written into the genes. Instead, it's the slow and gradual process of mutation and natural selection, working over many generations, that drives evolution.\r  \n\r  \nSo, evolution is not so much about individual efforts to adapt, but more about how small, random genetic changes can give some individuals an edge, allowing them to survive and reproduce more effectively in a certain environment. These tiny advantages can add up over the generations, leading to the diverse species and adaptations we see in the world today.",

            "comment": "One example: \n\nThe growth of physical traits is very often under the control of multiple regulatory genes, and multiple varieties (alleles) of each gene. We can see examples of that in the wide range of heights in humans. In a perfectly mixed population, you would have porcupines with all sorts of quill lengths, but as soon as you introduce a selection filter like a predator, things change. The most vulnerable porcupines will get removed from the gene pool, and overtime the alleles responsible will be lost from the population, or are relegated to a much smaller total percentage of the population which are now on average more protected.",

            "comment": "A lot of comments here explaining that its a slow process..\n\nSelection, mutation, and drift. Population bottlenecks. Rapid selpeciatiinection (several generations vs thousands of years) can occur when environmental pressure puts an extreme live or die selective pressure on a species. If that species has genes conferring fitness advantage in this setting over other genotypes in the same population, and mutation or separation limits intraspecific breeding, than speciation can occur relatively fast. A good example of this is generalist weeds that grow on mine tailings or serpentine soil or other toxic environmental bottleneck. In these situations even though the noxious environment stunts the growth of the plant, their capability to survive in that ecological niche gives them a resource advantage over plants both in their species and others, that can't. This ramps up the selection, and sometimes even over the course of a few generations individuals side by side, on and off the contaminated site, will no longer be sexually viable.",

    "postText": "I am learning about white blood cells and their various roles and functions they have during an infection. Neutrophils have cytokines that induce a fever response and can cause inflammation. If an immunocompromised person that suffers from aplastic anemia can't produce white blood cells, will they be able to still have a fever when they are sick? Will they experience any symptoms that derive from an immune response?",

Fever in an aplastic anemia patient is serious.\n\nUnfortunately I'm not finding much on the actual physiology/cell bio of fever when a patient is immunocompromised. I'll try and come back to this.",

PGE2s are the main factor responsible for changing the set point in the hypothalamus, causing the shivering, vasoconstriction, etc that produce the fever. Further, exogenous pyrogenic factors from the infecting pathogen can also cause fever, which often are exacerbated in people with a compromised immune system!",

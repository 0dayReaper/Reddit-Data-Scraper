(For something im writing)\n\nA golden and white tabby she-cat, grey and white tabby tom, ablue and orange tortie with white chest (she-cat), and a white and blue color point with Lynx pattern on paws\n\nThese can have slight deviations, but could they come from the same litter?",

No one with a lot of experience with litters from feral females would blink twice at that much variation.",

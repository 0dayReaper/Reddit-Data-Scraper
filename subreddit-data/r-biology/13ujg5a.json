The names give a hint. Continuous variation is highly variable and you can have individuals all over the spectrum of potential variants with the majority of the species being somewhere in the middle, forming a bell curve. Discontinuous is distinct forms of variation with no In between. Think height (broad range of heights with any unique height within being possible) vs blood type (specific types, no hybridization or inter-types possible).",

    "postText": "Bit of a strange post but figured this sub worked for it. This happened to my mother about an hour or two ago. She was taking one of our dogs out to the bathroom when this deer just comes walking out from the trees (this isn\u2019t like a big forest either, it\u2019s literally a few trees and some poison ivy, our neighbors house is right on the other side) and just kinda stands there. Our dog loses her mind so my mom scoops her up and runs inside. She figured she\u2019d just wait until it left to go back outside and grab the dog poop that she\u2019d left in the yard. \n\nExcept the deer didn\u2019t leave. She sat and ate a bowl of cereal, watching it through the window, it just stood there. She did some cleaning, waited, nothing. She went back out into the doorway to the yard and watched it back, tried to yell at it, nothing. She took some pictures. It just kinda paced around outside, and our yard isn\u2019t covered either it\u2019s like right out in the open. At one point my father came downstairs and asked her to cut his hair, which they do outside, and at that point it had been like an hour so they just went back out to a farther corner of the yard. She used an electric razor while the deer stood and watched them. \n\nShe ended up texting animal control because this can\u2019t be normal and it\u2019s the second time we\u2019ve seen this deer in our yard (we think). Last time it just kind of passed through, but it still took its time (just not to this extent). It hasn\u2019t been violent, just strange. Anyone have any ideas?",

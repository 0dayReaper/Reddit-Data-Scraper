He's not saying there is no natural evolution and natural selection, he's just saying there was \"ancient alien\" intervention, so if you like the ancient aliens stuff I don't know what reason there is to be extra mad about this book, since it's just the same stuff all over again.\n\nAs for Haeckel I mean why do we care about respecting him at all? He was an awful eugenicist racist creep... if there's a reason to not use his art it's for that reason - who would want any association with him at all, not anything to do with respecting the man or his work.\n\nPersonally I don't like Haeckel and I don't like von Daniken, and I'm not surprised von Daniken wants to be associated with Haeckel, since they're both racist eugenicists... The whole ancient alien \"research\" scene always had unsavory associations with, and arguably had it's origins in, racist Nazi research into the paranormal before and during WW2.\n\nThe Nazis were the ones who started all this ancient alien BS and everything that followed is tainted with racist overtones. All the ancient aliens stuff is deeply tied into eugenicist racist ideas that humans are \\*already\\* the result of genetic manipulation, so maybe white people really are smarter because we were given an alien super gene... so what's the harm in doing a little bit more eugenics and genetic modification of the population, since we're already \"artificial\" anyway.\n\nThe ancient aliens stuff is all 100% creepy, I'd advise being a lot more skeptical about the associations you're getting yourself into if you personally go for any of that garbage.",

I know that's controversial these days but I can hardly deduct points when that point of view was literally completely ubiquitous.  He contributed more than either of us so I'm going to keep respecting him (and using his art in my slideshows) but obviously you do you.\n\nI didn't realize that ancient aliens had also invited a bunch of racist stuff, not that I care for anyone to elaborate. It's mostly something I look back on fondly, considering these crazy theories as a child. I don't remember seeing anything unsavory in it then but if I did it certainly went over my head. Anyway I'm a professional scientist and I don't actually believe in that stuff so don't sweat it on my account.",

There's a reason creeps like von Danichen refer to people like Haeckel with imagery like this, and you should think twice before associating yourself with that same imagery, because even though you may not intend it, you may be validating those associations in the minds of some of your students.\n\nAnd that point of view was not at all ubiquitous, there were always many people who did not fall for that lunacy, and the fact you would state that it \\*was\\* ubiquitous makes me question your decency, honestly.. maybe that racist/eugenicist messaging got under/into your head after all. Yes, most of the historical record was written by the insane racist lunatics who were in charge. But we have an abundance of evidence that these viewpoints did not prevail nearly universally.\n\nCan you retract that and honestly acknowledge that it's an extremist statement to say that EVERYONE at the time was a racist eugenicist, or are you just sympathetic to those viewpoints? Haeckel was a scumbag, unequivocally, and if you say otherwise, you are too.\n\nThe thing you miss about the progress of science is that it was going to happen, and there's no need to forgive the failures of the past as being inevitable to have achieved the present.\n\nThere was nothing necessary about racism and eugenicism that enabled Haeckel and Darwin to come up with their theories. The theories could have and would have been achieved outside of those environments.\n\nSo it's a joke to say we should forgive these creeps for anything. We can factually acknowledge they were the first to present these theories, but glorifying them in any additional way by, for instance, presenting their art in a positive light, does nothing except validate them generally including their worst aspects.\n\nDo you want to participate in that, really? If you're a teacher presenting Haeckel, you should take maybe an hour to go over his theoretical contributions while also including the historical context that he was a racist shitbag. If you're a decent pedagogue you will not shy away from this responsibility.",

Then people discovered the electron microscope. This made it possible to make the molecules within the cell visible, and suddenly questions about evolution arose that were not possible before. Which force actually bundles the atoms in the right order? What moves the molecular chains into the correct position? How did the first living unit within the cell actually come about? How does inheritance work, how does information pass on to the next generation? Did humans descend only and exclusively from primates\u2014as Charles Darwin and countless other great minds assumed\u2014or did additional \u201cengines\u201d intervene in evolution? Today it is clear: countless questions can no longer be answered with the previous theory of evolution. There is a form of life called \u201cBlob\u201d (Physarum polycephalum). The \u201cthing\u201d has neither eyes nor ears, neither a mouth nor a nose or even a brain. Nevertheless, it takes in food, overcomes obstacles by the shortest route and exchanges information with other \u201cblobs.\u201d The \u201cblob\u201d contradicts any evolutionary thought that one develops from the other. Or the \u201cgastric-brooding frogs\u201d (Rheobatrachus) found in Australia. They hatch their young in the stomach. Impossible in a slow, evolutionary process. Everywhere there are characteristics of animals that do not want to fit into the theory of evolution anywhere. And man? Are we really the most adapted life-form on this planet? Today, more and more scientists who contradict the previous theory of evolution speak out. The theory fits the changes within the species, but it can no longer be reconciled with the inner workings of the cell. Some other influence that has so far escaped us is affecting evolution. It is called \u201cIntelligent Design.\u201d Intelligent planning is suspected behind this. Anyone or anything\u2014a spirit of the universe? Aliens?\u2014could be behind this planning. Erich von D\u00e4niken uses countless examples to demonstrate the impossibility of the previous evolutionary idea. He quotes scientists who argue against the previous teaching, but also those who defend it. Unfortunately, established science still refuses to look at discrepancies and holes in the theory of evolution, even though it is quite obvious that there is more going on with regard to the development of all species, as well as human culture, than could be explained by the theory of evolution alone.",

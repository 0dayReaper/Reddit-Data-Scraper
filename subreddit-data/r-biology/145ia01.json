            "comment": "This photo is from one of our up-and-coming amateur microscopists over at /r/microscopy. They have managed to capture what I think is an absolutely fabulous image of a Vorticella with its spasmoneme coiled up. Look for the ripples on the spasmoneme sheath and note the elongated macronucleus in the center of the ciliate's body. The fourth photo shows the macronucleus as well, in addition to the striated pellicle and the ciliary wreath near the critter's mouth.\n\nThe images were captured using an Olympus BH2 configured for Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) and an iPhone camera looking through the eyepiece.",

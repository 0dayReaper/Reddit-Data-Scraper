            "comment": "Looks like a Mygalomorph (aka tarantula) so yes it is venomous. Top arrow is pointing at the abdomen which is nothing unusual, bottom one is pointing at its pedipalps - its a male, and they use these long pedipalps (highly modified legs, hence not legs) to transport sperm to female; females have short pedipalps. It's not a stinger. It's fangs can be observed right between where the long pedipalps join its body.",

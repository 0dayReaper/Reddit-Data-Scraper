            "comment": "What part are you talking about, the mRNA isolation or the delivery of the mRNA to a patient?\n\nIf you look up mRNA isolation you will find many protocols, the particulars that moderna and pfizer use are proprietary/patented but mRNA isolation even of a specific one is a fairly common and easily googleable, usually an mRNA+\"tag\" is added to a DNA sequence that is used to transform some cells that then produce the mRNA+tag. After allowing time for the production the cells are lysed and the mRNA isolated via the tag sequence, the tag may or may not be removed depending on what it is and whether it affects the mRNA, they likely trialed several options while in the basic science phase. The actual mRNA sequence in the vaccine has been published on github by some people who felt it should be open knowledge.\n\nPer delivery of the mRNA they complex it with a lipid carrier, again there are several options of lipids and combinations to choose from and what they use is proprietary/patented. You can then simply add the complex to patients (by injection) or cell culture samples by adding it to their media. This is the actual transfection and is very common in research settings, though we use non-clinical grade lipids like lipofectamine 2000, I believe the protocol remains the same in regards to complexing which is basically just mix the lipid and mRNA in a solution.",

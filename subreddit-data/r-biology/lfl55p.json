As he slows the car down he notices that they all have three legs. Astonished, the man turns around, pulls in the farmer's driveway, walks up and knocks on the door. Out steps the farmer in his stereotypical overalls and a floppy, old hat. \n\n\"What can I do for ya?\", asks the farmer.\n\nAnd the man explains, \"I was driving by and I noticed your field of three-legged chickens and, well, I just gotta ask. I mean, what do they taste like?\"\n\nThe farmer looks out over his a field and replies, \"Well, to be honest with ya, I've never been able to catch one of the sumbitches.\"",

My mother works for a company that breeds, raises, transports and sells ducks and geese, and she sometimes goes to one of the breeding facilities. Once when I was there, one of the newborn ducklings was a similar mutant, with four legs (2 of which were I think on his back) and vertically arranged eyelids (the poor thing was blinking sideways). The workers there said that they've even hatched a 5 legged duckling once. I was later told that the duckling died the same day. Appearantly these special little guys don't have a high survival rate.",

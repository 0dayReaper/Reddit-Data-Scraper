It can be somewhat treated by chelation therapy ( basically chemicals that help get metals and +ions off whatever they binds to.) But in humans and mammals that I know of it doesn't get naturally removed by any specific enzyme.",

Lead may decrease MAOA expression so that might be part of lead toxicity induced aggression, but lead has a multitude of other effects as well.",

I'm a bit older than you as I graduated 15 years ago but I don't remember learning about these cells in my biology classes and I'm sure if I did I'd remember it bc Biology was part of my most favorite classes. Just out of curiosity, is this in the normal curriculum nowadays or are you in some sort of advanced/science focussed curriculum? \n\nI'm asking also bc shortly before I graduated, a new educational system had been implanted so my friends who were a year younger than me were learning things I hadn't learned the year prior. People in my year were following the old system like me. The \"new\" system compared to ours was like having everyone younger than us learning stuff that had been taught only to advanced kids/kids in specific science curriculums only, before.\n\nI feel like school fucked my generation more than yours.\n\nEdit: I thought about something else too. Some of the good but boring classes that we had, had been removed with that reform. Like, I was the last year having a \"Family Education Class\" where we'd work with a sewing machine (we made boxers/pyjama shorts) and learned how to use an oven/follow a recipe (we made cookies). And on my last year, we had an Economy Class, where we learned how to budget, follow the stock market and such. Learned about politics in there too. We made a fake budget project where we had to \"rent\" an appartment and buy all new furnitures as a team of two with mostly minimum wages. Only 3 teams had money left at the end. I was in the last \"winning\" team with 0.01$ left after all bills payed and all the furniture was bought.\n\nLooking back on it, it's absolutely crazy that 15 years ago, it was already barely possible for 2 minimum wages to cover moving out without any hand me downs from family. What a bad omen it was for today's old future... :(",

Catabolism means to break down a polymer into its smaller components (glycogen to glucose). \n\nGlucagon increases blood glucose but does not build up macromolecules. By your reasoning these terms are made completely useless. \n\nCatabolic/Anabolic state are widely used terms in medicine/endocrinology and specifically related to certain hormones (catabolic: glugacon or cortisol for example) since these hormones are used in stressful situations when there is an acute need for energy sources (glucose, amino acids, ffa's). Insulin is considered anabolic since it is released after food intake, when there is a high blood glucose and stimulates glycogen production (polymerisation: anabolic), inhibits gluconeogenesis and keeps lipids stable instead of breaking them down to free fatty acids (inhibits catabolism of lipids).",

Having a feedback system means that one hormone necessarily activating one thing could deactivate another through its effects downstream and consequently cause catabolism or anabolism.",

It can even be considered as a part of a catabolic process since gluconeogenesis requires certain amino acids or glycerol which are obtained by breaking down lipids or proteins.

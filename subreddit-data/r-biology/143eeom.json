    "postText": "I\u2019ve only recently learned that the class Reptilia (as well as I presume, other taxonomic rankings) is a paraphyletic group as it does not include all its descendants: i.e. Aves, the birds.\n     I found this very surprising and confusing, as I understand how colloquially a classification based on morphological traits would be useful, but what is it doing in a taxonomic rank?  I don\u2019t see any usefulness for a paraphyletic grouping in a system meant to evolutionary relationships.",

            "comment": "IMO, We learned Aves were descendants of Reptilia through DNA long after Linnaeus created his classification system. At the higher level you can see the phylogenic trees drawn to account for this, but for the general population  it\u2019s easier to separate them into different groups. It also takes a very long time for the scientific community to agree on changing something and then follow through with the entire change.",

            "comment": "As a previous commenter mentioned the determination of reptiles and birds been related came after Linnaeus' time.\n\nAlthough often confused, scientist do usually treat Linnaenan taxonomy as separate from phylogenetics. One is used for classification and the other for evolutionary relationships. You can think of it a bit like a library, books are normally in categories and then alphabetical even when that really isn't the most appropriate arrangement. Sometimes books are put into the wrong category and you end up with books from one series split across two categories (day urban fantasy and horror), because someone made a mistake or didn't have all the information.\n\nThat's what happened here, Linnaeus didn't have all the information and by the time we realised (about 200 years later) the taxonomic status of Aves as a Class along side Reptilia was so entrenched in scientific literature and popular culture that there was no changing it.\n\nA similar thing happened with birds and dinosaurs, it is more correct to say that an asteroid wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs, but most people wouldn't say that. In the same way that if someone says they study dinosaurs you expect to find them in a museum not out in the field with binoculars.\n\nFor an evolutionary point of view we might talk about the disapids (reptiles, birds and dinosaurs) but for taxonomy, where we are more interested in correct identification (at least at the higher levels) we stick to the traditional Linnaenan names.\n\n(we do start looking at evolutionary relationships more or less from the rank of Genus down, and there was a bit of a storm around 2010 when someone proposed a reclassification that would have changed the name of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), there was soms very fierce debate on if thr name shiuld be retained on the weight of 'tradition' regardless of the offical classification.  They ended up not reclassifying it, thankfully, it was the biological equivalent of Pluto)",

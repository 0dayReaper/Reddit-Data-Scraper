    "postText": "Apologies if this isn't the right place to ask this;\n\nI've been pondering on this for probably years. But are viruses just a weird type of emergent life? \n\nWe started with basic chemical combinations and gradually changed with our surrounding environment, and then started evolving with a degree of agency, Right? \n\nAre viruses the same thing? Emergent life where the only environment that exists for them is the body of a host. It doesn't think. It just does. Much like we did before we became multi-cell organisms.\n\nIt's a rabbit hole of thought, for me at least. I understand the origin or viruses is largely indeterminable, but am I onto it or having a runaway thought?",

On the other hand they rely on cells because they are not dogmatic \u2014 the don\u2019t have the capacity to follow the full dogma and need cellular machinery from host cells to do so.",

They replicate using our machinery, therefore, the more aggressive the approach, and the more damage you cause to the host, the shorter you make the life-cycle and ultimately cull those mutations. \n\nI think?",

Either a new way to use their function or a different function. \n\nOr they could have come after some other form of life, which at a glance seems to make fewer assumptions but I\u2019m not super well versed on this",

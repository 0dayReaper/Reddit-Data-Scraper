    "postText": "I'm wondering how to properly pronounce them when you're speaking English. I'm a non-native speaker, and I want to do it correctly. I know some non-English rules of Latin pronunciation, but I don't know if they are acceptable when you're speaking English.\n\nSo, I'm wondering if you're speaking in English at a conference to some scientists, and you want to mention terms like euarchonta, scandentia, hominidae, hominoidea, ponginae, or  chlamydia pneumoniae, or clostridium difficile... how do you properly pronounce it?\n\nIf you pronounce it according to rules of Latin, that are not English based, will it sound wrong, will you be understood?\n\nAlso where to learn proper way of English pronunciation of these terms?",

            "comment": "I am sorry to have to tell you this but there are no rules, a friend and I both say Collembola differently (col-em-bo-la, colem-bu-la) and we are both native English speakers who learnt our pronunciations from native Engliah speaking supervisors. \n\nThe problem is that the names come more or less from Latin which is a dead language so no one has a definitive pronunciation guide. Also some names (especially at species level) or words from other languages which have been latinised (I think the International taxonomic organisations rule about how this is done now but that wasn't always the case).\n\nAs someone with phonologic dyslexia (I have great trouble finding phonics in words I don't know and therefore knowing how to pronunce them), I completely feel your pain in trying to work out how to say new scientific names. I usually get a colleague or friend to help me, or at least tell me how they would say it and go along with that (or of possibly I might also look for a YouTube video that uses the word, proper phonetic renditions of names can sometimes be found on line but I don't find those help me much)\n\nYour best bet at a conference is to have the word on the slides or poster so people can connect how you say it with how its written, which they should recognise even if they don't quite get your pronunciation. Even if everyone was pronouncing it the same way, different accents would still make knowing for certain what name someone is using tricky.\n\nIn my experience people at conferences will usually understand that you might pronounce some of the scientific names differently and can typically follow what you are saying if you are getting at least close.\n\nAlso remember that English speakers can't agree on the pronunciation of English and still manage to understand each other (tomato and, in the UK, scone are good examples of this)",

I think most of us just copy our mentors in the beginning and then move to the pronunciation we hear most often after that.",

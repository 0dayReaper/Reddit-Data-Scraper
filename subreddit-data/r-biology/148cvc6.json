    "postText": "A diver in Australia came down with a severe ear ache after a seven day live aboard dive trip. She went to a doctor who could not see into the ear due to swelling, but tried to clean out the ear and administered antibiotic drops. Around midnight that same day she pulled THIS out of her ear. \nRunning theories are gecko who crawled in while she was dry and asleep, some kind of flat worm (trematoda), little squid or other kind of small fish like a gobie. \n\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33",

            "comment": "When I returned home from Australia back in 2004 I had an ear ache for weeks. Visited the doctor 2/3 times who told me it was blocked up (thanks). I had it flushed out with some success, some gunk came out. The pain persisted so my mum took matters into her own hands with a torch and a pair of tweezers. After rummaging around for about 30 minutes she finally got hold of the source of discomfort. We laid out the ear invader and unraveled it\u2026.. it was about 4cm long, brown and had eight legs.\n\nI never went back to Australia.",

Whereas we \u2018Mericans have spread mercilessly over every inch of our country and therefore encounter bears, mountain lions, coyotes, bobcats, etc, not to mention rattlesnakes and scorpions. \n\nHere\u2019s the story: Once I took a group of Aussie friends camping in the PNW woods. All was good and chill until night fell and I started stringing up our remaining food in a bear pack since we were in black bear country. One friend saw me doing this and casually asked why, so I explained about bear safety and precautions (I also did this before we left but he apparently hadn\u2019t listened) and reassured him that we were in black bear territory, not brown bear, so we would be fine regardless but it was just better to be safe. \n\nMy friend had suddenly become very still, and he asked me about how big a black bear averages. \n\nI blithely replied: \u2018Oh not too big at all, they\u2019re like 250-450lbs, browns are much larger.\u2019 \n\nHe went white, muttered something about \u2018fucking Yanks and their fucking bears\u2019 and spent the night huddled up in his tent with a whiskey bottle jumping at every small noise. \n\nI think he would\u2019ve preferred a cassowary.",

Snakes are common to come across in summer. \n\nBut the \"everything will kill you\" thing with Australia is overplayed. \n\nAll of the things that can kill us aren't any more interested in meeting us than we are in meeting them. And we are all raised to check and respect that we share our space with animals that can kill us but rarely do and aren't hunting us. \n\nA deadly snake in our garden just needs a moment to move on. We check our shoes before we put them on. \n\nAnd a big huntsman spider eats the bugs and poses not threat to us so a lot of Aussies just let them be when you have one in the house. Give it a name and let it do its thing. \n\nWith the exception of sharks and salties (and we know where they are) the animals in Australia aren't out to get you.  \n\nBears are a fuck no for most Aussies. They don't mind the odd scalping and killing. \n\nTbh, having to consider bears on a camping trip doesn't sound relaxing to me. But it's just not what I'm used to. \n\nAnd I've lived all over Australia. And camped, in a swag, in every state. And I'm old as fuck. \n\nI have never had anything crawl into my ear. Some, not all,  of the \"this guy told me...\" flavour of some of the stories in this thread are common tales we've heard before and know are bullshit. \n\nWhat you've just recounted seems like a totally logical to camping in an area where a massive land animal hangs out that's ok with killing you. We don't swim with salties here which is pretty much the same thing, just add water. \n\nOP was unlucky. Don't know what that is.",

That's kind of the thing though, Australia doesn't have many very dangerous animals that will actively pursue you and maul you, with the main exception being crocodiles which only live in Northern Australia. \n\nMostly in Australian wildlife, it's about being well-covered and somewhat cautious about where you put any exposed parts of your body. In most of Australia, if you have a decent quality tent which doesn't have any holes then you can sleep easy. Even when it comes to snakes, most of them have fans which are too small to get through regular jeans.",

It feeds on brainwave energy received not from its own carrier but from those around it. It absorbs all unconscious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to nourish itself with. It then excretes into the mind of its carrier a telepathic matrix formed by combining the conscious thought frequencies with the nerve signals picked up from the speech centres of the brain which has supplied them. The practical upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language. The speech patterns you actually hear decode the brainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your Babel fish.\n     Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mindbogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen it to see it as a final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God.\n     The argument goes something like this: \"I refuse to prove that I exist,\" says God, \"for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.\"\n     \"But,\" says Man, \"the Babel fish is a dead giveaway isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.\"\n     \"Oh dear,\" says God, \"I hadn't thought of that,\" and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.\n     \"Oh, that was easy,\" says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets killed on the next zebra crossing.",

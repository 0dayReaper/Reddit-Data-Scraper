    "postText": "There are other animals capable of inteligent behavior such as dophins, elephants and octopuses. Are we really that much smarter or are we luckier than other animals due to the body we have, size and ability to finely manipulate stuff around us? Like, even if a dolphin could they would not be able to come up with tools and create a worldwide society simply because they can't finely manipulate stuff around them as they lack the body parts. Same with elephants, the trunk is too bulky and lonely to be able to do anything more than grab big things. \n\nSo are there really no animals as mentally able as us or are they actually not able physically to do what we do?\n\n\nEdit: remembered to add 2 aspects: the ability to learn from others (primarily from the same species so complex language as well as ability to use tools and tieing them up together.) and lifespan (living for &lt;10 years doesn't really allow for much to be learned, achieved and perfected).",

            "comment": "As I understand it, paleontologists consider that Homo sapiens has a unique hability to create new ways and tools. Some consider it being the reason why sapiens replaced all earlier human populations like Neanderthal or Denisova.\n      \nThat said, orcas seem particularly good at inventing new hunting skills. And octopus are very good at solving new problematic situations.\n        \nI think, as you said, that our body gave us the capacity to become the dominant species. But on the other hand, I think we clearly underestimate animal intelligence. Because it's easier that way for us.",

Octupus on the other hand live under 5 years, way too little to acheive much and be able to observe and understand the world they live in on a deeper level, even if they are very good problem solvers.",

            "comment": "They're less intelligent. When we give them tests &amp; challenges, they perform about on par with other relatively intelligent animals like dogs and pigs and monkeys. This gets announced as \"wow look how intelligent they are!\", and then people who only saw or heard the headline &amp; hype, and didn't pay attention to what the test really was, get carried away with it and puff it up a lot. But the reality is that even the ones that demonstrate the most intelligence, which is other apes, still top out somewhere around the equivalent of a human at age 4-6, minus anything resembling even a 2-year-old's language ability.\n\nThe fact that the world's highest intelligence developed only in apes is probably enabled by the fact that we have hands with which to do something with it, though. There's nothing to cause a species to develop extra intelligence that it can't put to use. Only in a species that could put it to use would there be any reason for it to develop.",

Slime molds can be used as an alternative to computers.\n\nSpeech? Whales appear to have developed language, though we haven\u2019t cracked it.\n\nSuicide and murder? Lots of animals.\n\nA sense of justice? Most communal species.\n\nPlay? Almost every species outside of lower life forms.\n\nAll of the above?

(For a fun example, google cockatoos opening bin lids in Sydney. A researcher on that project gave a talk here recently, and there's some great video material online.) Crows can seemingly teach each other which humans are dangerous.",

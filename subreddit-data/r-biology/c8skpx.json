Regions of the genome which are not polymorphic or for which polymorphisms are neutral with respect to each other aren't really being targeted by selection. They may have their allele frequencies altered somewhat by linkage to regions under selection, but in that case their own evolution is not adaptive.\n\nIts an open question about how much of the genome is actually experiencing selection over any given period though.",

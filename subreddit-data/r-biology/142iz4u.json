I have a theory they pop up alot more during the seasons youll see bioluminecence in the plankton since thats when ive seen them the most. Theyre surely intresting, if i was a biologist id surely study them they seem like they have a intresting life cycle.",

(I'm a BIG FAN of polychaete worms :D) They can technically bite, but aren't aggressive and will leave you alone unless you literally grab its head or something. Which, idk why you'd do that, they're quite slimy. But king ragworms are predatory and can eat other invertebrates, including other worms! They do this mostly based off of chemical cues, not physical, however. So I wouldn't worry too much about walking around on the beach and one of them popping out of the sand. Although as a marine biologist I generally recommend wearing some kind of shoe or sandal on the beach regardless. Anyway, I'm rambling - I just love polychaetes!",

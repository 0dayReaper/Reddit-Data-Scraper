Still working on ways to curb the others without mucking up the local food chain though. Like, the sweet little humming birds are losing abundance of a food source around my house, but there are plenty of other areas to fly to for their protein. They still get their sugar water, and plenty of flower nectar, from me.",

I took the feeder down, laid it on the ground and gently pulled it out by the tail feathers. It kept grabbing the sides with its claws and I would gently loosen its grip then pull it out a bit further. After 5-6 tries it popped out, and flew away.",

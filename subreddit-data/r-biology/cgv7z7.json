It's important because otherwise there'd be no way to stop the protein from being made, and so it wouldn't be able to detach and go on to make more protein. It would be super-wasteful in terms of resources, quite apart from the fact that it would also probably damage the proteins that were produced.\n\nSo UAG is the stop codon for a super-important and super-fundamental biological process inside living cells.",

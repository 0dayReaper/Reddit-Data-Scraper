    "postText": "for my upcoming exam i need to learn the difference between c-sources and sinks in terms of c-allocation. i don't know, call me stupid or just an overthinker, but why is it like this: *\"Carbon enters the plant via photosynthetic uptake of atmospheric CO2 (source activity) and is then partitioned among several sinks, including respiration, structural growth, non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) and secondary metabolites (SM), as well as carbon export such as biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) and root exudates. Hence, plant carbon allocation patterns are generally explained by the balance between source activity and sinks strength. Such a balance, however, can be altered by changes in resource availability, such as water, nutrients, temperature, light and CO2 (Fatichi et al., 2014)\" or here: \"The photosynthetically active parts of a plant are referred to as the  source. The areas of active growth and areas of storage are referred to  as sinks. However, a source is not always a source, and a sink is not  always a sink. For example, leaves that act as sources when the plant is  fully grown are known to act as sinks when the plant is growing. The  stems and branches act as a sink, but when they are young, then tender  stems are green and perform photosynthesis. Thus they act as sources  when they are young.\"*  \n\\- Why is photosynthesis not considered a sink-activity as it reduces the amount of atmospheric CO2?-&gt; here a definition of a c-sink i found: ''*Any process, activity or mechanism which removes a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas from the atmosphere\". In the case of non-CO2 greenhouse gases, sinks need not store the gas. Instead, they can break it down into substances that have a reduced effect on global warming. For example, nitrous oxide can be reduced to harmless N2''* \\-&gt; following this definition, processes such as respiration, should be considered a source as it increases the atmospheric CO2 as it \"burns\" sugars to generate energy and by doing so CO2 is a \"side product\" (like O2 during photosynthesis).  \n\n\nwhen i look at it from the plant's perspecitve, then it makes sense that photosynthesis is seen as a source activity as its result is sugar, which is then used for other processes. but why on earth is respiration considered a sink activity?! it just makes no sense for me and i need someone to explain it to me. Respiration burns sugar and generates energy which is used for metabolism, so it gives sth and acts as a source and not a sink. or is it just because it cannot make photosynthesis it's not considered a source-acitivity? the i still wonder why. and also because it makes no sense in terms of the clima-definition of c-source/sink.\n\nPlease help",

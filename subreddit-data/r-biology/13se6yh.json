If it's too out of character I won't be offended by being pruned\n\nWhat processes in human or general biology (or other general natural if you're feeling frisky but this isn't r/AllTheThings so maybe PM anything OT.  Or not; I'm not sure what the culture here is) are between about 4 and 16 days?\n\nI'm playing with a little amateur philosophy of time and questioning the correctness of a seven day week.  Is seven actually more correct than 6 or 8?  Is there a reasonable case for a eleven days, maybe with a two day work weekend and one day weekmiddle?  And cetera \n\nBio isn't the only consideration, and probably not the primary consideration, but I don't have the background to see biological processes that might be important if they exist\n\nThanks in advance",

And thinking like a scientist - how would you define, measure, and test it?",

Likely others but I'm not a biologist\n\nLikewise months.  Certain cycles occur monthly in humans as well\n\nAs to specifically correctness, yes, that's a philosophical or axiological question, but that doesn't make facts irrelevant.  If there are biological cycles that occur every 5-6 days for example, that's some evidence for a shorter week.  Something every nine days would be evidence for longer\n\nI didn't come here for philosophy, though I'll take it if you'd like.  I came for the science.  Are you aware of any objective patterns in human or general biology that have a period of 4ish to 16ish days?",

I'm certain there are biological cycles that operate on 7 day cycles just like there are biological clocks that operate on 4-week cycles give or take a week or two. But that doesn't mean anything, just that evolution landed on a timer for that process that was good enough.",

I would be surprised enough to find it in fact I'd have a good hard look at the research methodologies \n\nI'd argue \"doesn't mean anything\" as an input to philosophy or human psychology is too strongly put, but definitely a very small effect even if found \n\nBut regardless, asked and answered, thanks.  I don't know any either and I'm certainly not throwing any stones \ud83d\ude01",

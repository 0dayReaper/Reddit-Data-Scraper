            "comment": "I'm pretty sure I remember reading something about the basic throughput possibility of the human digestive system, and how you really only can intake a few thousand calories at absolute most in a day, simply due to surface area limitations of your small intestine, because your large intestine just sucks out the salt and water, but doesn't absorb any nutrients, as that was the job of the small intestine, and the stomach's only job was dissolving and breaking things down with acid and enzymes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbasically, the only way you could possibly  consume that many calories is if you ate some sort of snake like thing that could form fit to your small intestine's walls for optimal surface area, then you would have to become incredibly constipated for several days or weeks while your small intestine worked around the clock to absorb it all. \n\nIn the mean time I would be very worried about salt and water intakes, as well as literally every other vitamin and mineral, because to the best of my understanding, if you wanted the most calories possible, you could just drink several gallons of raw cooking oil, but you would definitely die if you tried to subsist only off cooking oil, as without any water or other minerals for cellular respiration, all of your organs would shut down and you would absolutly die.\n\nfor the sake of argument, lets say this super food had all the calories, but was something like a thick slurry with enough salt, minerals, and vitamins to keep you going, absorbing thousands upon thousands of calories per day would simply make you profoundly obese, which would also definingly give you other health concerns in the long run.  \n\neither way, this sort of ultra food thought experiment is one of my favorites, hope some of my thoughts either helped, or were interesting!",

    "postText": "I had a debate in my science class, we had an assignment to photograph any osteichthyes \"bony fish\". After researching I was curious, could you technically take a photo of any four-limbed vertebrate?\nMy reason I was wondering was because if we're thinking about the phylogenetic tree lobe finned fishes and Ray finned fishes derive from osteichthyes, and tetrapods come from lobe finned fishes, so could what derived from tetrapods also be considered osteichthyes?",

Your intuition was correct.\n\nAs you know, humans are mammals and the expected answer to \"why\" is \"because they descend from the most recent common ancestor of mammals\". That's also why they're apes, monkeys, primates, primatomorphs, euarchonts and so on, and indeed if you follow their line back far enough you come to the realization they're also boreoeutherians, eutherians, therians... therapsids, synapsids, amniotes. They're also included within tetrapodomorphs. What's a tetrapodomorph? Well technically we're them but you know how I mean, who were the first?\n We're thinking of these amphibious little beasts, a transition between true tetrapods and... who?\nLobe-finned fishes. Those and ray-finned fishes do in fact derive from osteichthyes. Because a clade includes a common ancestor and all its descendants, we're osteichthyes too :)",

He said no because we're not thinking of common ancestors in this scenario, but how could you not? osteichthyes is that entire group, it includes all of those branches that narrow down to more specific species. It doesn't really matter for the project because I just submitted a photo I took of some fish, and that worked out, it was more just my own curiosity that made me want to debate it haha",

This seems like a pretty intro level bio class to me, thus the bullheaded and pedagogically not terribly useful-seeming \"sUbMiT a PhOtO oF a FIsH\" (if you guys know enough cladistics to know that could be any tetrapod, why cling to the semantics? for power? for the power he already has over you as students, which requires nothing?) - in all of those you're better off honing a sense for what the preceptor wants from you and mentally filing away your actual learning for another time. :^)",

Plus, It's not like I'm doing it to just be right, I just love diving into anything I can and figuring things out for myself because learning about all this is so fun.\n\nWe had a project where there was a bonus to complete an analysis involving chi squares and such, it took me a while to figure out but I got completely hyperfocused on it and ended up getting 100% which I was very happy about.",

I assumed as much from the description of the assignment. \n\nIt gets better and becomes more about really learning, I can promise you that, though not for much of early college, lol.\n\nIf you liked your chi-square project you'll probably love diving into population ecology later, in uni - there's lots of lovely new types and flavours of graph and function :) I remember finding the actual stats and documentation bits of this stuff a terrible slog at your age, but then I read a good, coherent, non-curricular, intellectually honest text about the history of science and my universe expanded. \n\nDo you have much leisure time to read in? I remember senior year of high school mostly in terms of a nasty feeling in the pit of my stomach and a total inability to get any sleep, so maybe not, but if I'd had time I would have loved for someone older to give me a good, thorough, readable, pressure-free reading list about my academic interests. I've been getting ready to finally commit to a proper degree, so I'm refreshing a lot of stuff, and it's mostly all the same sort of thing you're just getting into. If you'd like, let me know what you want to read about, I'll set myself a reminder to get back to you with recommendations {:",

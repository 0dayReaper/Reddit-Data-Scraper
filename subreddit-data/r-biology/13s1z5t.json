    "postText": "So something I've always struggled to understand is how our body absorbs toxins. I'll ignore all the rambling about my question and just skip right to it. If we are doing shots why does 4 shots in 15 minutes get us more drunk than 4 shots in 1 hour? Are you really more drunk or does it just feel that way? Will you sober up at the same time What? What about 4 shots in 4 hours every hour on the hour? Would you feel anything from that? I personally never do one drink an hour so I wouldn't know. Surely you would at least get a buzz going, but would it still be in your system as long as it would he as the 4 in 15 minutes? Wouldn't it have to be?",

By consuming four shots in 15 minutes there is a precipitously larger increase in blood alcohol content in a shorter duration.\n\nThink of it as hitting the gas and accelerating 100 mph in 15 seconds instead of 100 mph in 60 seconds. You're going to be pushed much further back in the seat during the former.",

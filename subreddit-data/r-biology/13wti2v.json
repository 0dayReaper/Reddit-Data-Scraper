    "postText": "The short of it is that I\u2019m pretty burnt out. Following my PhD and post-doc in molecular microbiology, I decided to take a job working at the bench for a small startup focusing on synthetic biology. The work is interesting, the pay is great, but to say the company is poorly run would be an understatement. Successes are trivialized, failures are heavily criticized, and I\u2019m left with a bad taste in my mouth, to the point that I\u2019m questioning if I even want to be at the bench going forward. I\u2019ve been searching for another job and find myself wondering what else there is for me out there. I\u2019m at a loss for what my other options are however (aside from sales which seems equally as miserable in its own right). Hoping for some help from others who have either considered or made the jump.",

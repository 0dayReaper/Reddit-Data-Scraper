    "postText": "Another Calathea story.\nLately, my Calathea has been curling up because it really didn't like being divided. I even thought it was about to die\u2014leaves curling, stems going limp and turning crispy. So, I decided to put it in water (with my Monstera *hello* due to lack of space) bc I was so exhausted.\nAnd within 24 hours, it completely opened up, and the stems became upright again. \n\nDo you have any advice on caring for a Calathea in water? Do you think it will continue to produce new leaves? Should I lightly fertilize the water to provide nutrients? I know that water, even if I use rainwater, doesn't provide any.\n\nI'd like to remind that it was about to die, so even if I'm not doing everything perfectly, I'm still learning, and I'm thrilled to see it improving since I put it in water.",

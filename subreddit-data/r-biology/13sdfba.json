    "postText": "I found this in my back yard. At first I thought it was some type of animal poop but when I looked closer it kind of looks like eggs. It was dried up when I examined it but it moved as a whole. We have a lot of birds in my area (east coast of Canada) and we are located by a river. The crows in our area eat a lot of frogs so I thought it could be frog eggs that were dropped? Hopefully someone can help!",

            "comment": "\"Hive minds\" as often used in popular media don't really exist. Colonial organisms don't have collective thoughts, or really any thoughts at all. Behavior is driven entirely by instinct and chemical signals.\n\nBees are often used as the classic example of a hive mind. Their collective behavior looks on the surface as if it's controlled by a single intelligence. They are coordinated in their efforts to benefit the colony. Further study, however, has shown that each bee acts independently. By isolating a bee in a lab, its hive behavior can be induced by introducing the correct signals, such as pheromones and light, signals that are produced in the hive by various conditions, no different than any other animal's behavior.\n\nCan a virus or parasite evolve to become a eusocial organism, like bees or ants?\n\nA virus is a very simple construct, biologically speaking, just some protein and nucleic acids. So simple in fact, that it doesn't really meet some of the commonly accepted criteria to be considered an organism. They do follow chemical signals, but they would have to become a lot more complex before they even start down the path that would eventually lead to eusociality, and they would have long before that eased to be a virus.\n\nParasites are eukaryotes, far more complex than even bacteria, which in turn are far more complex than viruses. Many animal parasites come from families that already include eusocial species, so their evolution towards such is indeed plausible.\n\nThere are currently no known examples of more than one species forming a eusocial colony, and no known mechanism to make it possible. Some ant species are known to enslave other species, but that's not really joining them.",

I was kind of thinking like the Borg from Star Trek.\n\nThere's also an idea that's been floating around for a while that God is a collective consciousness. One iteration of this idea is that our computers will eventually become comex enough to perfectly mimic a human brain. At that point, we could \"upload\" our entire mind into a computer for a sort of immortality. Enough of those computers linked together becomes intelligent enough to take on all those duties traditionally assigned to God, including going back in time to cause the creation of the universe.\n\nOf course, the biological limitation to that is that we are not just our brains. Many of our thoughts also come from our endocrine system, and possibly even from our gut microbiome.\n\nAs I'm typing that previous paragraph, it occurs to me that that is also an avenue you could explore. Many of our gut microbes can secrete chemicals remarkably similar to our neurotransmitters, so the feeling that your mind translates as \"I could really go for a snickers right now\" may have been planted by them. Not consciously of course, but by secreting a chemical when they're short on certain nutrients, your behavior might be changed.",

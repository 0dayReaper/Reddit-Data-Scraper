However, for AB specifically, it would be Co-dominance\n\nI would suggest asking your teacher for clarification if a similar question is asked on the assessment. Alternatively, answer as though it is referring to the generality of blood typing as that is what is on your review guide.",

            "comment": "According to the question it's stating that the AB blood group is a phenotype inherited.\nAnd as the answer here is Dominant, Recessive and Co-Dominance.\nI think the question here is solely asking about the 'broad spectrum inheritance' of a certain blood group, not only the antigen but the Rh-factors too, because sometimes when we are asked or talk about a certain blood group we use it's basic antigen to denote it, such as A, B or O, but not as A- or A+.\nHere the question is asking about the inheritance spectrum of a certain blood group that is AB.\nAs we know that the 'Gene I' controls the ABO blood grouping and the production of sugar at the surface of Red Blood Cells, it has three types of alleles: I^A, I^B and i\nNow the 'I^A' and the 'I^B' allele produce sugar but the 'i' allele doesn't.\nAs humans we are diploid organisms, we have two alleles, one's dominant and one's recessive present in the genetic locus. But in the case of ABO blood grouping there can be the case of Co-Dominance especially for the AB blood group instead of the complete Dominance exerted by other blood groups such as A or B but not O, as someone with blood group O has both 'i' allele that's recessive and doesn't produce sugar, thus having no chance of having complete Dominance.\nNow when you have an AB blood group you'll have both I^A and I^B alleles producing sugar over your blood cells, but now you need to have an Rh-Factor: a certain inherited protein over your red blood cells, either Rh+ or Rh-.\nAs the basis of genetics goes, in a scenario of a locus having heterozygous allele + &amp; - one has to be dominant to exert the phenotype or if the alleles are homozygous where both of the alleles are + or -, the genotype of the offspring will be same as the parent e.g. if both the parents have positive allele then the  offspring for sure will have the positive allele, with no chance of negative allele.\nSuch as the case with Rh-factor, we can't be entirely sure of the offspring's Rh-factor until we know the Rh factor of both the parents, there is always a 50/50 chance of having a positive allele or negative allele(but in most cases of homozygous allele the positive allele is the stronger one that enforces over the recessive one,) but in case of homozygous alleles we can be certain of a particular allele e.g. if both the parents have negative Rh-Factor then their offspring is to have the negative Rh-factor and not positive as there isn't any.\nBut in the case of a heterozygous parent, there is a 50/50 chance of the offspring having either Rh+ or Rh- factor.\n\nAs with the question, the different allele of the gene I e.g. (I^A &amp; I^B) present in the AB blood group contributes to the Co-Dominance, and as for the dominant and recessive it's up to the Heterozygosity or homozygosity of the Rh-Factor which can either be 100% for the homozygous parents or 50/50 for the heterozygous.\n\nThe answer is solely from my own view to the question,\nfeel free to correct me and double check with your teacher.",

Why are we classified as male or female? Why cannot we be just one sex that can reproduce with someone else?",

            "comment": "Hermaphroditism is a common sexual configuration in non-human animals, where an individual displays both male and female reproductive organs. Hermaphroditism can occur in two forms: simultaneous hermaphrodites, which have both male and female sexual traits at the same time, and sequential hermaphrodites, which exist as males and females at different stages of their lives. The latter is more common. Some often mentioned examples of hermaphroditic species include worms, snails, slugs, and some fish.\n.",

Having one sex that can never carry young frees them up to provide food and protection for those that do.\n\nPresumably there was sufficient evolutionary pressure on the ancestors of species with a sex binary, such that reproduction any other way was disadvantageous (i.e. that species died out).",

            "comment": "There are a bunch of different reasons, but a lot of evolutionary biologists subscribe to the theory that sexualization in species is a way to have more variety in genotype of the offspring, allowing for faster adaptability to new environment (whilst also preventing hitchhiking of \"bad \" genes, by recombination. it's more efficient than simply relying on mutations to give you a genetic code suited to your environment. Males and females are another way of applying more selection pressure on species, usually by letting males compete for females, the weaker individuals with bad genes are generally weeded out faster.",

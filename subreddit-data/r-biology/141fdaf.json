    "postText": "So was at IKEA the other day, buying houseplants and almost all of them had young small leaves sprouting out. Do plats have these constantly or are they sold only when they start sprouting new ones because people use is as a metric if a plant is healthy ans are more likely to buy them? I'm talking plants like monstera or strelitzia",

            "comment": "If a plant is healthy it gererally constantly spreads out new leaves. Especially tropical plants as most of our houseplants are. Temperate plants often enter an overstory stage in winter, which means they retreat into the soil, their roots or special storage tubers, or drop their leaves such as many deciduous trees. They then wait for spring, when they begin to sprout leaves again. But if a houseplant is stressed, for example because it was not accurately transported or because of a cold shock and so on they tend to react to that, much like our own body does. They go into survival mode, what means they stop growing leaves until they are healthy again and can afford to.",

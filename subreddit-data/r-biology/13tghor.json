    "postText": "Hi everyone, Im currently a rising 4th year undergrad BS biology student. I have been premed but have recently decided to switch to drug development. I was planning on taking gap year for med school, so I wouldn't start applying until June of 2024 (I graduate may 2024). I was wondering what the timeline is for grad school and when you need to start applying and if it's possible for me to go in without a gap year, or is it too late now? I was also wondering what the steps are to get into drug development, if there are any schools that are more geared towards that, etc. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!",

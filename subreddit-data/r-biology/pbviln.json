                    "comment": "You\u2019re a bit off base here. The vascular bundles ARE xylem and phloem. The xylem transports water and dissolved minerals up (which are sometimes salts and sometimes not), and the phloem transports sugars built from photosynthesis down. \n\nOK, enough correction :) Now where does the water come from to dissolve the sugars for transport in the phloem? From the xylem! So it can be thought of as analogous to a circulatory system, with xylem being analogous to arteries, phloem analogous to veins, and the soil analogous to the heart. (And photosynthetic parts are analogous to a mouth)\n\nNOW you may ask (or already know) about how water fights gravity to get to the top of plants (water does NOT enter through leaves. It exits through them). As I mentioned, there's no pump for its \"circulatory system\". Touch a stick to a puddle very slowly. Watch it closely JUST as it touches. You'll see the water \"jump\" to the stick, \"fighting gravity\". Combine that force of adhesion with the pulling force (tension) of evaporation through stomata on the leaves, and you get tall vascular plants. \n\nThe evolution of the biosphere to become vertical on land is fascinating! Mosses and liverworts use to dominate the land. These are not great habitats for animals. But as vascular tissue developed, so did habitats for animals. And now here we are apes are swinging through trees and orbiting the planet!",

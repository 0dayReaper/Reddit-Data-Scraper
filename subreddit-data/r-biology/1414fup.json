Photosynthesis is a simplified term to combine plants production of energy from a photosystem + electron transport chain, and the separate process of using NADPH to create sugars.\n\nPhotosynthesis is a lot more complex than the simple \u201cwater plus CO2 makes glucose and oxygen\u201d\n\nWhen we were talking about Purple Sulfur, Purple Non-Sulfur, Green Sulfur, and Green Non-Sulfur Bacteria we never talked about photosynthesis because they don\u2019t release oxygen\n\nEdit: in fact, we even called them the anoxygenic autotrophs. Photosynthesis didn\u2019t come up until we started talking about cyanobacteria",

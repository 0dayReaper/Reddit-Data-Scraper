    "postText": "So I\u2019m in israel and there are a lot of stray cats. There was one that was acting chill and walking around us humans so I threw it a small piece of orange that it licked for one millisecond and then walked away. A few seconds later I picked up and touched the orange and then threw it away. As far as I can tell I have no bruises or cuts on my fingers. I then washed my hands throughly. Is there any possible way rabies could be transmitted on the orange? Or would this not count as direct transmission?",

            "comment": "Transmission of rabies is typically via a deep bit or scratch. It has also been documented when the siliva of an infected animal comes into contact with the mucosa (eyes or mouth) and on very rare occasions an open cut.\n\nThis means that unless you had a cut on your hands (and a relatively deep one) which was still bleeding you will be fine. One of the main purposes of the skin is to be a barrier and keep out infection. Rabies needs help to cross the barrier (direct transmission), if you had decided to lick the orange after the cat did, then there could be direct transmission as the cat's siliva would be in your mouth. You washed your hands which will have destroyed the virus so you should be fine.\n\nOf course this is not medical advice and if you are truly concerned about transmission you should seek advice from your medical provider, once rabies symptoms appear it is too late for treatment except in a couple of incredibly exceptional cases.",

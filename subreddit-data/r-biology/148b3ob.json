Many Native American and Mexican (not all, I know) cultures put significantly more emphasis on their relationship to their environments than early Europeans did at that stage of their own development.

Shamanism or worshiping of nature was not only super common in early Europe but several of the major religious holidays of today have their routes in \u201cpagan\u201d. Celebrations of major events in nature. \n\nThe issue is that we are much further removed from European nomadic life and much closer to the America\u2019s form of nomadic life. So the native Americans version has been actively seen and recorded by a culture with writing  as it declined. The European nomads were long gone by the time any current country had formed.",

Honestly, probably the best place for it.\n\nOP, if you wanna be sure whatever comes out of that egg sac doesn't escape, put the tub lid down in a tray of  soapy water with a weight keeping the lid and edge of the container under water. Soapy water kills bugs fast (the soap breaks down the oils that keep water from coating them and they die of suffocation), is not a risk to anyone, and doesn't require special disposal. \n\nAs to why you'd keep the lid below the waterline, it's simple: can't escape if the only escape route is lethal.",

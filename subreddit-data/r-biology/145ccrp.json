    "postText": "so the MHC1 complex will present whatever peptide is being made inside the cell is what I understand. Im curious (1) so cytosolic proteins will by chance be picked by the MHC1 and be presented and therefore among the numerous MHC1s on a cell each will present a random peptide? and (2) how does the binding site bind with anything? is specificity not required for structures to bind to the MHC1? it can bind to any antigenic peptide for the immune system to recognize is my understanding.",

            "comment": "During protein synthesis, some proteins in the cytosol suffer degradation by the proteasome, which generates short peptide fragments. These peptide fragments can be transported into the ER by a specialized transporter called the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). \n\nInside the ER, MHC-I molecules associate with these peptide fragments and are then transported to the cell surface for presentation to T cells. However, since different proteins are continuously being degraded in the cytosol, a diverse range of peptides can be presented by the numerous MHC-I molecules on a cell. This allows for the sampling of a variety of intracellular peptides, including those derived from viral or tumor antigens, increasing the chances of immune response.\n\nAbout the specificity, MHC-I molecules have a peptide-binding groove formed by two chains, the alpha chain and the beta-2 microglobulin, which has specific structural features that determine the size and shape of the peptide it can bind. \n\nThe binding site of the MHC-I molecule interacts with specific amino acid residues of the peptide, creating a stable complex important for the immune system to recognize between self and non-self and respond to specific antigens.",

            "comment": "The cytosolic protein is first degraded by the proteasome in peptides (the protein is tagged by addition of ubiquitin molecules). The generation of peptides is increased by the formation of the immuno-proteasome, a special proteasome which is induced by interferons (a class of proteins that are released during infection)\n\nA peptide generated by the proteasome is transported to the endoplasmic reticulum (where the MHC-I is synthesized) by a protein complex called peptide loading complex (which  contains a protein called TAP, that constitutes a kind of tunnel by which the peptide can pass through. The expression of TAP is also increased by interferon). Once in the endoplasmic reticulum, the peptide can be bound to MHC-I.\n\nMHC-I peptide-binding pocket consists only of one chain (alpha chain), as opposed to MHC-II, whose pocket is formed by two chains (alpha, beta). Because of this, MHC-I can accomodate smaller (8-10 amino acids) peptides than MHC-II (10-30 amino acids).\n\nThe binding of the peptide to MHC (either class I or II) is mediated by specific amino acids (residues) called anchor residues. These residues can vary depending on the MHC polymorphism (ie the alleles you inherit from your parents). In the case of MHC-I, these anchor residues are generally located in proximity of the extremities of the peptide (near the N/C-termini), and the are generally hydrophobic (or sometimes basic). The interaction is mediated by hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds.\nNote that the presence of the anchor residues is a necessary but not sufficient condition, ie: the chemical nature of other resides can prevent the binding of the peptide even if the anchor resides are ok (these are referred to as \u201csecondary anchor residues\u201d).\n\nOnce the MHC-I has bound the peptide, the peptide is presented to a TCR of a CD8 T cell. The TCR can bind both to the peptide and MHC- molecule (especially to MHC-I\u2019s conserved residues located in regions known as CDR1 and CDR2), while CD8 binds to the alpha3 domain of the alpha chain of the MHC-I (this interaction keeps the TCR closely bound to MHC-I during antigen presentation)",

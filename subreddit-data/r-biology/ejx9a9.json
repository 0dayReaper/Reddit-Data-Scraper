I'm guessing 8 just looks more like \"all the other numbers\" than any other digit, in a similar way to how it takes up all the segments of a seven-segment display. \n\nIn the case of the number in the 10s position, the data sample probably just had more 1s and 2s (I guess you wouldn't expect random books to have so many illustrations that 1-9 were all as equally represented in the ten's place - more likely to get illustrations only counting up to the 20s rather than say 80s). So in other words, in the kind of cursive handwritten script used in beetle illustrations, just as 8 looks the most like \"all other digits\", 2 probably  looks the most like all other numbers out of the first few (1, 2, maybe 3...)",

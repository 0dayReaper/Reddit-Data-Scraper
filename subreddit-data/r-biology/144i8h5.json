We rescued a feral cat a year ago and when we took her in, we inspected her carefully and took 6 engorged tics off of her and they were still alive and its absolutely disgusting to watch them lie on their back helpless and fat. The most disturbing thing. She passed with a clean bill of health at the vet :)",

Does our body create it, do our mothers pass it down to us or maybe we ingest it as we eat or get exposed to them as we grow up?",

I'm a teacher and I like to know what presupposed ideas people can have. It helps being better at teaching \n      \nYes, the microorganisms we have on our skin, in our digestive system and other parts of our body come primarily from our mother but also from our environment. That is one reason why it is not recommended to bath your baby in the first days. Their skin is protected by the vernix and will get their own microbiota. If you bath 5hrm, it can alter it. The bacteria in our digestive system come from contamination between the mother and the baby during the delivery. After birth, babies get their microbiota from classic contaminations (dirty hands etc...). Mechanisms of such contaminations are not fully understood. But we know that the mother's microbiota has a very strong influence on the baby's one.",

When a baby is in the uterus, there are no bacteria in its colon, so how is it colonized by *E. coli* and other bacteria? The answer is that the baby either acquires it from the mother during a natural childbirth (but not a Cesarean) or from the environment (e.g., the hands of people who hold the baby).\n\nSource: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/789255/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/789255/)",

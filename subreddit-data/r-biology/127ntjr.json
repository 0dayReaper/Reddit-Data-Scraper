But honestly, people don't have a framework of knowledge to even understand what \"more closely related\" really means.\n\nYesterday a guy asked me if boas are considered mammals because they have live birth, or if they're marsupials because the eggs hatch inside them. Guy wasn't stupid either, he just knew a few basic facts without a context to interpret them meaningfully.",

It's just problematic no matter how you slice it because individuals vary in all these morphological ways across time and space. Juveniles don't have the adult male markings either. These names seem to reflect our biases about what's important. It's somehow always justified to be the differences between males that matter. This is why we have scientific names and one of the reasons why common names are so often misleading.",

Our American Robin really isn\u2019t similar, aside from having orange on the chest; it\u2019s twice the size and four times the bulk of the European bird, and these days it isn\u2019t even classified in the same family. Neither are the Australasian robins (family Petroicidae), more than 50 species of small, sharply patterned birds found from New Guinea to Australia and New Zealand. \n\n[Source!](https://www.audubon.org/news/ask-kenn-kaufman-are-american-robins-really-robins) So, as is the case for most everything else wrong with the world, we can blame the English lol",

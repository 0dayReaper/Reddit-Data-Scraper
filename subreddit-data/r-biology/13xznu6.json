            "comment": "Yes but I'm not sure if it has been done yet or not. There are certain genetic regions such as QYrPI197734.wgp-1A and QYrPI197734.wgp-3B loci in wheat that help determine the temperature resistance in wheat. Wheat is one of a fairly small number of plants that we have been able to get CRISPR based gene editing working. So in theory it would be possible to edit this in wheat, although it would take some time and effort. \n\nThis isn't the case for every plant species. In most plants we don't know what to edit to improve temperature resistance and in others we don't know how to edit successfully without killing them.",

            "comment": "We have been modifying plants for centuries before we knew about genetic engineering, by the way. Many of our grains are not endemic to North America but were transported and bred to grow in different climates. The problem IMO is, where are your engineered modified plants going to actually grow. We are trying our hardest as humans to eliminate all wild species and cover any (already depleted) soil with concrete or more huge houses. Unless you mean to adapt plants to the higher temps on Mars \ud83e\udd2a \n(Sorry for rant! I am being traumatized by biodiversity loss.)",

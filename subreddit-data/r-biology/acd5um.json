After spreading to the community, it is then called an adaptation. \n\nAn example of a mutation that confers no evolutionary advantage is when people are born with six fingers. It does not help the species reproduce, thus is not widespread, thus is not considered an adaptation. \n\nThings that may seem like simple non-advantageous genetic mutations in a globalized society may actually have originated as adaptations. Take eye color \u2014  blue eyes are a mutation that became widespread in Northern communities where daylight was scarce, as they allow more light into the eye. ",

I remember reading that it was hypothesized that light colored eyes may affect distribution of light onto the retina, but after doing some research, it appears that is not supported. \n\nHowever, blue eyes tend to be more sensitive to sunlight because melanin offers a protective factor against full spectrum light. Blue eyes are less prevalent, therefore, in brighter (equatorial) areas because they would be more likely to be damaged by bright sunlight. In other words, blue eyes are maladaptive in areas like Africa, South America, and South / Middle Asia. Therefore, though the mutations *may* have arisen throughout history, those individuals did not survive to reproduce and the gene was not passed on.\n\nHope that clears things up. \n\n",

Try:\n\n*The Selfish Gene* by Richard Dawkins. Though it was written in \u201873, it gives a very robust conceptual framework for understanding more specific and recently studied evolutionary phenomena. Also, it\u2019s readable. Also, he coined the term \u201cmeme\u201d in this book (!)\n\n*The Making of the Fittest* by Sean B. Carroll. Written much more recently and is accordingly more technically contemporary in its claims. It follows a variety of genes as they make their way through history. \n\nIf you don\u2019t mind the Victorian prose, I would also recommend an annotated (because he made mistakes) version of Darwin\u2019s *The Origin of Species*. It\u2019s an amazing historical document if you\u2019re into that. \n\nHappy reading! \n\n\n\n",

Regardless, this is in Asia and we would be in Africa for the next 6 million years, so, definitely not primates.\n\nCould of course be monkeys but I haven't yet seen any evidence that monkeys share parts of their fruits.",

Why does matter eventually arrange itself into consciousness? Why does matter arrange itself at all? \n\n\nThe arrangement of matter into form over time seems to me to be an actuation of memory. Memory is the core of consciousness. Our ability to think over time is just a reflection of the universe's own memory. Is it conscious? You tell me. Are ant colonies conscious? Can the earth be considered one single, conscious, entity? Can the universe? Is it self aware? Does it *feel* things? Can it interact with itself? Our form, the way biological life *feels* and interacts with things, tends to make me believe that, yes, everything can *feel*, no matter how micro or macro. And our consciousness, our ability to think and move and feel freely is \"God\" personified. We are the proof that it's all conscious.",

Do you know how many people believe Einstein was religious because he did something similar in that he called the natural laws of physics and mathematics \"God\"? It's a bit dishonest to provide validation to the theistic gods by mangling things up like that.",

It's up for scrutiny and discussion. It's not currently testable but I think AI will change that in the coming years. And no, I won't stop using the word god to describe god. It's an important part of the concept. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think what you're asking me to do is close the discussion from my perspective because you want to militantly dispute theism and you can't do that with me. I reject this as a tactic. I think it's as close minded organised religion. You're telling someone else they're flat out wrong when you don't know either.",

Even though I think you're making a lot of assumptions to reach your hypothesis, the reason I'm not disputing it is because you seem to be on the same boat as me in that you respect science and are ready to accept scientific evidence to verify your claim, in case it should become available. The reason I wish you didn't use the word God is different altogether: in the west, and currently especially in the USA, most theistic people will happily dismiss scientific progress that goes against their beliefs, and will even fight to impose their worldview on others. What do you think about schools teaching theistic intelligent design and simultaneously dismissing evolution as \"just a theory\"? Or dismissing global warming? Or dismissing medical treatment for their kids and opting for prayer? The earth surely is 4000 years old? By saying things like \"I believe in God\", you validate these people even if just a tiny bit, because they won't even try to understand your following hypothetical explanation.",

The parent comment said that there\u2019s a \u201cbig difference\u201d which isn\u2019t true. \n\nThe other comment I replied to compared calling mandarin oranges an orange to calling a guinea pig a pig. This is also categorically untrue. \n\nIf I have a basket of mandarins and someone asks me to pass them an orange, I\u2019m not going to scratch my head in confusion. \n\nI literally cannot think of a plausible situation where calling a mandarin orange an orange would confuse anyone. Like even if you\u2019re telling a story about a party where you ate a mandarin orange and you called it an orange, it would be almost the exact same mental image. Even if you said mandarin at first and orange later in the story nobody will be confused. \n\nNever in my whole goddamn life has someone referred to a mandarin as an orange and I was confused. Seriously, I have no idea what you people are on about. \n\nEdit: besides this post. This is the only time I\u2019ve seen confusion over this. But even then the confusion isn\u2019t over the name. The Australian seems to think that they\u2019re entirely different things, as evidenced by his comment about oranges being unsegmented. ",

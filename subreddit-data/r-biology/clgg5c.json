There is not a pedantic bone in your body.\n\n&gt;But, they is not only a plural pronoun.\n\n&gt;This chameleon word is also a singular pronoun, and it has been for centuries. Lexicographers have determined that as far back as the 1300s, they has been used as a gender-neutral pronoun, a word that was substituted in place of either he (a masculine singular pronoun) or she (a feminine singular pronoun), e.g., Each student should get their supplies ready for class. Each student is singular, but we don\u2019t know (or need to know) the gender/sex identity of each student in this situation, so their is perfectly handy. Even Chaucer, Shakespeare, Jane Austen, and other beloved writers of the English literary canon used singular they. \n\n~[Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/e/they-is-a-singular-pronoun/)",

Ugh and there was one pregnant cat and my teacher dissected it and pulled out each kitten. They were fully formed and it was...a lot.

We\u2019d also cover the head as well so it just looked like a body and organs. Don\u2019t get me wrong tho, I am in no rush to do this ever again lol. But I feel ya, I never took anatomy and physiology in college bc the text books had pictures of cadavers haha. And oof looking at the dog heart with heart worm was really sad too. Now I\u2019m a crazy person about getting heart worm meds for my dogs. But yeah one cat was enough for me. Worst part is I now have a cat that looks slightly similar to the cat I dissected and every so often I look at him and remember and get a little sad.",

The putrid smell of decomposing animals was just as bad if not worse. Then the cat dissection was a week long lab. Made the entire wing stink horribly. We held air fresheners up to our face.

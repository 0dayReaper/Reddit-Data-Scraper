    "postText": "Hi, I attended a transfer orientation today to go to a university for a bachelor\u2019s in science in biology. I found out halfway through, however, that they offered little to no online courses. I was expecting at least half to be online optional. \n\nI live an hour away from main campus and I work a full time job. I cannot afford to go to part-time working to attend my degree program (I don\u2019t think financial aid and student loans will be able to cover my expenses). I\u2019m crushed, and I\u2019m really at a loss in what to do. \n\nI found a different college that offers a Bachelor\u2019s in Arts in biology that is an online program. Is someone able to explain if there\u2019s a real difference in the work field? \n\nMy only other options are to change my major to something online friendly or quit my job and move. These are not ideal, and I\u2019m a mess right now. Does anyone have advice to continue my education in a biology degree with this restriction?",

            "comment": "I guess it depends on what you want to do, but for most biology related jobs I\u2019d suggest a Bachelor of Science program that incorporates in person lab classes. That\u2019s like the bare minimum at many places (I work in Industry). I\u2019d also highly suggest doing at least one internship at minimum (in a relevant field would be ideal, but since you might not know what exactly you want to do yet, there are many options for hands on lab internships that will look good). It will make it so much easier to get hired. \n\nThis is pretty generic advice, so it may not apply to every job or situation. But it was largely true for me and others I know in biology based fields",

Don't get me wrong the biostats and bioinformatics part is also very cool and I've since dabbled in them but nothing gets that feeling of \"child me would think I'm so fucking cool\" then playing with DNA and specimens and the lot lol",

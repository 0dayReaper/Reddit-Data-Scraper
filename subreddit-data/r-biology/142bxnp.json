They are mostly orange to yellow in colour and are endoparasites of insect larvae, particularly Lepidoptera. They are very diverse but morphologically very similar. They have a worldwide distribution but the majority of species are found in the temperate zone.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophion_(insect))",

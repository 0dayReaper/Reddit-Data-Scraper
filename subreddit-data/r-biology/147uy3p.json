Frogs have a lot of unique breeding habits so it's entirely possible to see them attempt to mate with each other. Hell I've seen frogs try to mate with rocks or dead ones lol.

Honestly I\u2019m certain a lot of people would just call this a bullfrog regardless of if they know better or not. It\u2019s very bullfrog like",

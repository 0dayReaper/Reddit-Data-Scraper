    "postText": "I\u2019m doing research this summer and today was a bit emotional. Im an undergrad student and Biology is my major. To my surprise, when I do labs I\u2019m sometimes lost. It wasn\u2019t like this in highschool. What can I do to grasp the concepts of an experiment so I can actually participate without making juvenile mistakes? I\u2019m very annoyed at myself. I hate how my group members automatically give me the \u201ceasy task\u201d of filling up water in flasks and graduated cylinders. I also understand because like I stated before, I get lost sometimes. Any tips? I want to make a drastic improvement. I love science!",

PhD students have been known to pick up the wrong pipette and then swear extensively as they ruin two days of work.\n\nSecond, as others have advised, see if you can get the protocol/lab notes to read through in advance. As for help, are you doing classes or working in someone's lab? (I'm in the UK and it sounds like you aren\u2019t so I don't know the details of how your education is structured). If it's a class can you ask fot advice from a TA/demonstrator, if it's someone's lab is there a friendly grad student/Post-Doc you can ask for advice?\n\nFinally, and I mean this with no offence intended, is it possibly you have an undiagnosed SpLD (e.g. dyslexia, dyspraxia or similar)? I ask because becoming lost in the steps of a protocol can be a sign of that. As someone who was diagnosed during undergrad I learnt to handle it by being very methodical in my lab working, ticking off steps as I do them, ticking off reagents as I add them, even the way I use tips from the box for a micropipette. These are all ways I use to help me keep track of where I am and what I need to do next.",

    "postText": "Since my childhood I have this silly question: in temperate regions we have 4 seasons and plants behave accordingly - they lose their foliage in autumn and then bloom and grow new leaves in spring etc. But what happens if you plant such temperate trees/bushes/whatever on equator where there are no such seasons? Will they all simply not grow there? If yes, why? If no, what will happen with their foliage etc.?",

            "comment": "Equatorial climate have relatively constant temperature and seasons so when temperate trees are exposed to equatorial climate they will face several challenges;\n1-the soil in these regions is often less fertile and have not enough nutrients required for the normal growth of the trees\n2-they will be also susceptible to pests and diseases cuz they are outside of their natural habitat\n3-equatorial climates have more rainfall throughout the years it will create water logged soil conditions that is not suitable for temprate flora\n\nSo growing temprate tree in equatorial climate is possible but will required extensive care and management...",

                    "comment": "Thank you but my question was - what will happen to their leaves? I mean - leaves cannot stay on the tree for ever, they simply get 'old', 'worn out'. In temperate regions this all is regulated by the coming of autumn when the trees lose their leaves. But how they will behave on equator, provided we take care to keep them alive there? And how the trees will \"understand\" it's time to bloom if there is no spring? That was my main question.",

I've looked at Quora where there was posted a similar question and the answers were quite different, from \"they will die in 2-3 year\" to \"they will live but bloom and give fruits in random seasons\" etc. No real, scientific answer was given. Like nobody ever tried it which is not true of course. Well, maybe during our European night some US redditors will answer.",

You can see the clear exterior of the egg for reference, and I don't think that changes size (until the end as the salamander starts to break out).

Like a bunch of space gas gets together because of gravity throughout millions of years until it starts doing fusion and radiation is balanced with gravity, and that makes the star? I saw that on a YouTube video so I'm not sure if it's right lol\n\nBut how is it similar to this? Genuinely asking",

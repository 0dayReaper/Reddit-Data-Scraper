There\u2019s still a few things to do like arranging the two fiberglass ponds* vertically into a cascading waterfall and a mesh protected plant grower to boost the aquaponics aspect. Oh and building a roof overhead is a long term goal. The leaves from a nearby tree are what made conventional pool maintenance seem like a wasted effort and expense. \n\n*In these i can cultivate things like aquatic plants and smaller aquatic fauna separate and safe from the goldfish",

Maybe look into creating a diverse water's edge, with a stair shaped slope and special plants such as reeds. These are very important for a pond ecosystem, since they provide key habitat for many species and are a better way to exit and enter the pond.",

I do intend to have another go at introducing some native marsh frogs but the last time i tried on a small scale they survived a year or two. I think the reasons were due to them not having enough of the things they require to get  a foothold in that area. There are possums and lizards other predators that probably picked off the adults i introduced before they could get to some baby makin. But in the longer term when it\u2019s been further developed i don\u2019t anticipate the goldfish will be much of a problem to amphibian reproduction. I\u2019m assuming you mean goldfish attack frog eggs given that they eat just about anything that will fit in their mouths",

A little chlorine would go a long way . Boil it, let it cool, put it in the fridge you're good to go, at least protected from  biological pathogens.

It doesn't mean it isn't an improved water source. Chances are the water is being treated with chlorine tablets that should kill the things that make you sick. But not necessarily all the larger things that could grow in there.\n\nThere is no MCL for mosquito larva in the USA or Europe. Many US domestic water sources are open air and undergo minimal filtering before being given to the public, if even that. There is a reservoir in Portland that has been in the news a few time for this.   \n\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/17/portland-flush-38m-gallons-water-man-urinates-reservoir](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/17/portland-flush-38m-gallons-water-man-urinates-reservoir)  \n\n\nI find this funny given I am quite certain that at least ducks swim and poop in it.",

CPG is for rhythmic processes like chewing or breathing, what we see here is the head bite and latch and nothing else, if it was triggered by a cpg the jaw would relax back to its original state and then bite down again.",

Long story short after some management of the situation he got it out and decided to kill it as noone had an effective method to transport it and I think something to do with the value of their rattles. So after having subdued it he went to hack it off with an axe. When hitting it with the axe near the back of his tail. This caused a reflex by the already dead snake where his corpse basically flew up and \"bit\" my uncle where it then discharged venom. And if my grandma hadn't forced him to go to the hospital I'd have likely lost an uncle from it.",

Walking is a patterned response controlled my a CPG. When one walks, they don\u2019t think of each muscle individually and tell it to contract and relax.

A signal is initiated and sent in a sort of closed loop from the spinal cord. Knee jerk reactions are part of proprioception, which is your sense of where your body is and how it is configured in the space around you. So when you\u2019re walking, and pressures are exerted on your tendon that the doctor hits with the hammer, that reflex kicks in to keep your knee straight. \n\nNow I\u2019m going out on a huge limb saying that the fishes response is a reflex arc, because I know absolutely nothing about the eel. But it would make sense that they would have evolved reflexes which bypass brain input in order to respond faster and have a better chance of catching a meal- just like we evolved to walk upright and have a reflex giving us a better chance at not tripping and falling. \n\nI could be, and probably am, wrong about this. But it\u2019s fun to think about.",

Most animals with venomous bites tend to not use too much force when utilizing it. Komodo dragons have a very low bite force, but their serrated  teeth make their bites devastating. Same with many of the venomous snakes, they just need to puncture flesh, not crush bones/shells. A strong bite force is not necessary to utilize venom, so having that amount of crushing force in a venomous bite is unlikely.",

If neurons (especially in brain for higher level functions) go too long without oxygen (which is needed to accept the final electrons from ETC and thus produce optimal ATP or energy), these cells die.\nSo without a heart to constantly fuel the fish\u2019s brain, they start to die. However, there are reflex arcs that connect muscles to only neurons in the spinal cord (rather than to the brain). After death (and brain dead), a muscle in the fish\u2019s mouth is being triggered (sensed by a sensory neuron which feeds back to neighboring neurons and eventually to the muscles in question).  The muscle contracts due to lingering amounts of ATP from anaerobic glycolysis and creative phosphate supplies. So I\u2019d say this is more of a reflex than a conscious decision on the fish\u2019s part  to bite the can, since it\u2019s most likely brain dead. This also explains why frog\u2019s legs twitch or \u201cdance\u201d sometimes after their heads are cut off.\n It\u2019s really interesting how intricate every living being is!

Although, you mention lingering ATP from anaerobic glycolysis, how much fat / other respiratory substrates do you think this fish carries around it's facial region to allow ATP synthesis to occur? Part shown is at most around 15/20% of it's entire mass I would estimate? Of course it's a reflex, it's dead, but the electric transmission across various neurons is, at least in humans, actively done, via the use of ATP. So where the shit is it getting all it's ATP from and where the shit is it's spinal cord to facilitate this reflex is what i'm asking",

Often times when the body can no longer gain sufficient amounts of energy from glucose or glycogen or other sugar derivatives, lipolysis and proteolysis can occur (this can occur when people fast for long periods of time). I also recently learned that fish in particular have high levels of creatine phosphate, which can serve as a rapid energy reserve.\nAnd as for the spinal cord, there are several regions that make up the spinal cord, each region containing numerous branching neurons. At least for humans, we have cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral regions. The cervical controls neck  movement. The thoracic region is heavily involved with neurons going through our arms, hands and fingers. And so on. It\u2019s likely that there is some of the spinal cord of this fish still in tact, or at least the part that is involved with the mouth.\nI hope that answers your question.",

            "comment": "No, for a few reasons. \n1) Besides anything else, there is no evidence anywhere that indicates that fish have consciousness. In fact there is a huge butload of evidence against it. They miss every cognitive aspect which makes up consciousness. Including metacognition, selective attention, fail tending to pain and mirror tests, or any sense of self. They don\u2019t have a cortex, which is pretty much a necessary condition for consciousness.\n\n1)a Fish are sentient (which means something very different than most sci-fi/pop culture media think it means) in that they have subjective experience. So yes, they feel pain and other things. Whether or not that experience is meaningful without consciousness, or if it is the equivalent of an input-output machine, is philosophical.\n\n2) The response is a reflex triggered from (probably tendrils) by the mouth. Reflexes are non-conscious actions in any creature. The signal travels directly from the activation site, to a ganglia (clusters of nerves) (often in the spine, but in the case of the fish probably straight to special motor areas in the brain. Where it is immediately re-route back to close the jaws.) Reflexes are advantageous for being much faster responses.",

For example some animals have a reflex to urinate when their bladder is full, like horses. Some animals have that reflex when they are infants, but at a certain age can learn to suppress it until an \"appropriate\" time for urination (dogs, cats, humans). But the reflex can reappear if the suppressive pathway from the higher brain centers is damaged or if the animal is unconscious (can occur when given anesthetic)",

Top down suppression and bottleneck suppression aren't necessarily indicative of consciousness. Ganglion in the spinal column can be restructured and conditioned (can learn) and so can the hindbrain and midbrain. It's not necessary be conscious, or even have a cortex to suppress a urinary reflex. For example someone can unconsciously suppress the urge to urinate while they are asleep, and dogs (of which there is no literature which supports anything but a very limited consciousness, if even that) can be trained to suppress it.\n\nOn the other hand, rats, which have shown evidence of limited consciousness in experiments, are completely unable to suppress the urination reflex.\n\nI think what you're hitting at is a matter of conscious decision and choice, which is both at the cutting edge of cognitive neuroscience and still in the hazy fog of duality philosophy.\nIf you haven't read dune, there is a chapter which covers this very idea. Where the main character isn't considered (by a religious sect) 'human' unless he can suppress the reflex to pull away from pain. The whole ritual is called the Gom Jabbar and is really interesting.",

And while you may be right about the potential for conditioning in the spinal column, hindbrain, and midbrain, I was taught that suppression of urination involves the cortex. That the urinary reflex involves the micturition center in the pons but neurons from the cortex synapsing on neurons in the pons can suppress it. And territorial urine marking also involves the cortex. Whether this suppression should be called \"conscious\" and how it could contribute to an animal's consciousness level is more philosophical and it seems that you know more about these discussions than I do.\n\nI know that dogs failed the mirror test but some have argued that it may be partly because vision doesn't play as big of a sensory role for them.

In humans, but not in animals which don't have a cortex but can still urinate situationally. Even then that doesn't make it a necessary condition for consciousness. Much of the cortex is involved in non-conscious behavior.\n\nThe mirror test is somewhat useful, but outdated. Unfortunately the smell test fail in a different way.\nDogs are timed smelling their own urine, or other dog's urine.\nThis does not indicate a sense of self any more than how your own farts smell decidedly less foul than others.\n\nAnd, like most articles disseminating research about dogs to the public (whose zeal to 'prove' that dogs are exactly like us is, in my opinion, awfully human-centric) it pretty much throws all the conclusions written in Dr. Gatti's article out the trash. In favor of a wild assertion that dogs have a sense of self and consciousness that perhaps this research MAY pave the foundation for. But that would require dozens of other studies with different, less flawed methodology.\nNote, I am not saying Dr. Gatti was flawed to use this technique. But it would be a flawed technique to use if he was trying to assert that dogs have a conscious sense of self. Which he wasn't, at least not with this study alone.\n\nAll this study does, is distinguish that dogs receive more sensory reward from smelling other dogs urine. Which is a no-brainer. Of course that is an evolutionary advantage, and would be selected for. BUT it does not have anything to do with a conscious sense of self. \nMost damning, is that dogs fail every non-handler test given demonstrating theory of mind. The sad thing is that people aren't even doing science here, they have run up against the ToM brick-wall a hundred times and are convinced that we just aren't testing dogs right. Even the most staunch Dog=Human researchers say that dogs don't have human like ToM (which is hopefully obvious to any serious researcher). Instead they point to studies which indicate dogs respond to cues from handlers. Instead of looking at the very real fact that these dogs are trained and conditioned to respond to those cues, they say 'OMG my pet puppy has consciousness!'\n\nSorry, but this stuff drives me crazy with canine psych. I worked in a canine cognition lab researching CCD and me and my PI fought wars over this in every conference. There's too much emotion invested in how we personify our pets. I love dogs, but isn't it a bit arrogant to assume that consciousness [a very specific pyramid of cognitive traits which compiled to give a very specific species a VERY specific evolutionary edge] pretty much the defining human trait, is a necessary condition for intelligent animals?\n\nThanks for hearing me out! I love the field of consciousness, but my current research is in a very different direction. It's cool to chat about it again!\n\nAnother book on consciousness that I recommend, is Blindsight. It explores intelligence and it's seemingly inverse relationship with consciousness in higher order beings [aliens].",

I am curious what animals without a cortex urinate situationally?\n\n I do understand the desire to anthropomorphize dogs or other animals that socialize with humans so I am skeptical of these types of articles. I did not really look over that article too closely to be honest - I just google searched for the study because I had heard of it and this article referencing it came up. I should have been more careful but I have to admit it's kind of funny - I brought up an example relating to canine cognition and linked something written for a broad audience since I didn't know your background and it turns out you have worked in a canine cognition lab! I just thought it was an interesting analog to the mirror test. But a mirror isn't regularly found in nature allowing for selection so I can see how that would be a bit more useful for demonstrating self awareness than the urine self smell test. You know more about the various tests and theories but I definitely agree one shouldn't assume that consciousness is a necessary condition for intelligent animals. \n\nAnyways, I am more interested in actually observing what types of awareness or control animals like dogs have and how to communicate about it than trying to prove or define consciousness or anything. I'm a veterinary medicine student and since I think you will find this interesting, I can tell you I've seen the use of the term \"conscious\" when learning about neurophysiology (and the word \"voluntary\"). I don't know if this is just sort of an artifact of the field of animal medical physiology borrowing from human medical physiology or what. Interestingly we actually learned about micturition from a neuroscientist who had been a postdoc fellow at a human medical school. But he was not the only one to use such language and he specifically used it for animals. Here is the most explicit usage of it from his notes so you can see what I mean:\n\n&gt; cortex is also involved with territorial marking of urine - to precisely leave a few drops here and there certainly requires accurate cortical control through conscious awareness and a voluntary plan\n\nThe part after \"through\" seems pretty controversial given what you've said and other things I've seen about animal consciousness.

I just discovered after doing some digging, that unlike almost all other reptiles, crocodilians have a pseudo-cortex. Which is really cool, but leads me to admit that in their stead I actually do not know any animals which can urinate voluntarily without a cortex.\n\nOn to the quote from your postdoc. I won\u2019t critique anything they are saying, for two reasons. The first is that they use the term \u2018conscious\u2019 which in my field has a different connotation than consciousness. The other is that consciousness has different operational definitions in different fields. I come from a neuropsych/cog psych perspective, and don\u2019t know enough about veterinarian or neurophys jargon.\n\nBut what they say is interesting to me, especially after \u2018through\u2019.\n\nFor one, because they use the term awareness coupled with conscious. Consciousness is to awareness as a bike is to a sprocket. It\u2019s necessary for the entire bike to function, and there are many different sprockets on any one adjustable gear bike.\n\nI imagine that they are getting (but don\u2019t know if) at \u2018selective attention\u2019, which is a lot less controversial \nthan conscious awareness. \n\nThe statement on conscious awareness producing a voluntary plan has several implicit statements:\nAnimals which can voluntarily urinate have some form of metacognition, and their selective attention can run in parallel processes. I.E. They can hold two opposing viewpoints (cost-benefit analysis might be a better term) at the same time, and compare the two.\nAFAIK there isn\u2019t any evidence that dogs have metacognitive abilities. Most articles that report evidence that dogs have some form of metacognition (See- Do Dogs Know When They Are Wrong?) are heavily critiqued on the bounds that they don\u2019t control for operant-conditioning.\n\nFor me, it seems that to say Dogs voluntarily irinate because they have awareness of their actions enough to have choice violates occams razor. \n\nIs it more of a stretch to conclude:\nThe mechanism behind a dog\u2019s ability to urinate voluntarily comes from a co-evolved metacognition and high order selective-attention?\n\nOr that Dog\u2019s high plasticity and social predispositions allow for seemingly higher-order behaviors to be mimicked through operant conditioning. [my theory]\n\nOr that dog\u2019s have an innate, environmentally dependent response which dictates when urination should occur, which can be influenced by conditioning? [less cool, but probably most reasonable theory]\n\nGiven that we as a species have these \u2018higher order abilities\u2019 and having those abilities are built into our lives, wouldn\u2019t it be a simpler conclusion that we took an intelligent, social species and molded it so that it\u2019s behaviors mimic our own? Rather than the behaviors just so happen to have co-evolved for a very specific purpose?\n\n\nAll that being said, I don\u2019t discount that dogs have some degree of consciousness. Consciousness in my fields operational definition is more of a gradient. Absence of many single facets (except a sense of self and metacognition) doesn\u2019t mean a creature is non-conscious.\n\nAfter all dogs are very social, and one of the biggest theories on consciousness posits that it is an artifact of the need to communicate. A sense of self and theory of mind needs to be established, so that meaningful transfer of communication can occur. This creates metacognition, because within our concept of self we can internally assign opposing viewpoints \u2018dialogue\u2019 values. \n\nAnd then selective attention integrates awareness into the whole picture. We can assign awareness values to metacognitive behavior (not just thinking about your own thoughts, but being aware of that internal process), and being aware of the sense of self, and others.\n\nDogs have through their evolutionary history needed to communicate, and they have the need to use limited pack tactics similar to wolves.\n\nBut I think it breaks down with the concept of being able to hold diametric positions mentally, and the sense of self.\n\nOh fuck I\u2019m gonna be so late.

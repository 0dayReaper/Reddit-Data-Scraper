The reason was longevity, they didn't expect many of the born children to live so they reproduced as much as they could so that at least a few of them could live. \nIt's about the accessibility of healthcare, the more you are sure that no matter how many children you'll have they are going live, the less likely you are to make undesired burden.\n\nAnd periods are part of a cycle that makes the uterus ready for pregnancy whether it happens ot not. Humans are not the only animals that do have this cycle or periods. All primates have this cycle and they are way better equipped to handle it, some of them can reabsorb the shed uterus and little to no blood may come out of their bodies.",

Humans evolved away from mating seasons to be able to reproduce at any time during the year, not just due to their expanded diet, but also because humans use sex as a form of social interaction. The constant ovulation means there needs to be a way for the body to removed unused ova. That's why periods exist.",

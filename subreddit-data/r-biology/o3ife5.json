Herbivorous insects, those that feed on plants, get most of their water from their food because plants contain a lot of water.\n\nBut carnivorous insects often have to get their water from somewhere other than their prey, and often they\u2019ll go to plants for their water too, drinking from fruit maybe. Or they might sip from the morning dew or from raindrops or from edges of ponds or puddles.\n\nIf they\u2019re blood suckers, they probably get their water from their food.",

            "comment": "That is a pacific man o' war, we call them bluebottles locally. Portuguese man o' war are found in the atlantic. \n\nThough they're the same species of siphonophores, bluebottles are much smaller and less venomous. Equally as annoying to find on the beach; they show up in dozens and you can't pay me to go for a swim that day.",

The pain could vary on how many tentacles got you and which area of your body got stung.\n\nFully dead bluebottles can be safely stomped barefoot and they pop like little plastic balloons, I've seen mates do it. But it's probably best not to take your chances in case they're too freshly dead imo. Stomp em with your thongs on if you must.",

Unless you\u2019re allergic, it would likely only leave a painful sting. These things tend to be less lethal than people give them credit for. I\u2019m also thinking this is the smaller, less lethal \u201cPacific Man-o-war\u201d, which is much less harmful.",

These dialects arise from unique environmental conditions, social interactions, and genetic factors within each colony. The dialects help naked mole rats recognize and differentiate between individuals from their own colony and individuals from neighboring colonies.\n\n**Vocalizations:** Naked mole rats produce a range of vocalizations to convey information. These vocalizations include chirps, trills, squeaks, and low-frequency calls. Each type of vocalization can carry different meanings, such as signaling danger, indicating mating readiness, or coordinating group activities.\n\n**Tactile signals:**Naked mole rats also use tactile communication extensively. They have sensitive whiskers and use them to interact and communicate with each other. For example, they engage in nose-to-nose touching, which is a common behavior during social interactions and helps to establish social bonds and convey messages.\n\n**Chemical communication:** Scent plays a crucial role in naked mole rat communication. They have scent glands located on various parts of their bodies, particularly around their faces. These glands produce specific chemical signals that convey information about individual identity, reproductive status, and social hierarchy. By detecting and interpreting these chemical cues, naked mole rats can distinguish between colony members and outsiders and establish territorial boundaries.\n____________________________________\n**2/2 Aspects of Genetic Biology:**\n\n**High cancer resistance do to evolving with things like:**\n  \n  \u2022 HMM-HA: High-molecular-mass hyaluronan inhibits cell proliferation and promotes tissue integrity, contributing to cancer resistance.\n\n   \u2022 Contact inhibition: Naked mole rat cells halt division upon contact, preventing uncontrolled growth and the formation and spread of tumors.\n\n   \u2022 DNA repair: Naked mole rats have highly efficient DNA repair mechanisms that rapidly identify and correct DNA damage, reducing the risk of mutations and cancer development.\n\n   \u2022 Tumor-suppressing genes: Naked mole rats possess additional tumor-suppressing genes, such as p16, which control cell division and prevent tumor formation, enhancing their resistance to cancer.\n\n\n**Long Lives:** \n(Smaller animals very commonly have faster metabolisms which a species metabolism is how to determine lifespan and how we perceive time)\n   \n   \u2022 Low metabolic rate: Naked mole rats have a relatively low metabolic rate, which reduces the production of harmful byproducts and slows down aging processes. This is because the  underground environment lacks abundant oxygen, and naked mole rats have adapted to thrive in low-oxygen conditions i go into next. \n\n   \u2022 Enhanced oxidative stress resistance: They possess higher levels of antioxidants and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes, protecting against oxidative damage and extending lifespan.\n\n   \u2022 Efficient DNA repair mechanisms: Rapid identification and correction of DNA damage help maintain genetic integrity and minimize age-related decline.\n\n   \u2022 Cellular maintenance and protein stability: Effective cellular processes, such as autophagy and protein quality control, preserve cellular health and prevent the accumulation of damaged molecules.\n\n   \u2022 Insensitivity to age-related conditions: Naked mole rats exhibit resistance to age-related diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular diseases.\n\n**Ability to Survive With Low Oxygen intake:**\n   \u2022 Underground habitat: Naked mole rats adapted to low-oxygen underground burrows, necessitating efficient oxygen utilization.\n\n   \u2022 Anaerobic metabolism: They can switch to anaerobic metabolism to generate energy without relying on oxygen.\n\n   \u2022 Oxygen efficiency: Optimized respiratory and circulatory systems allow effective oxygen uptake and distribution",

Our model animal was mice, but we did a brief collaboration with another lab wanting to use our methods to study IR injury in Naked Mole Rats. It was absolutely fascinating. We could not induce an ischemia severe enough to damage the naked mole rats' hearts.",

But oncology shows that most cancer resistant animals follow pretty much the same model as NMRs; in my post i only use oncology as the examples, and i list a few reasons. All of those reasons are seen in the majority of other animals with a cancer resistance besides HMM-HA. \n\nWhich the evolution dosnt match as for elephants are showing, Pervasive Selection which summarized just means elephants being extremely big and having a much higher chance for cancer. Making the need for traits countering it more needed for survival, whereas humans for example don\u2019t need those traits as cancers a rare genetic mutation in us making it not as needed, also called **Peto\u2019s Paradox.** As for NMRs it\u2019s social evolution and eusociality that\u2019s not a good way of putting it but this message is long enough and too explain NMRs you need oncology to explain and i\u2019m not getting into that. \n\ni\u2019ve been using oncology and comparative oncology loosely i mean comparative though. \n\nand sorry for the long message i just think it\u2019s cool that an animal getting to 3 meters tall and up to 9000lbs has almost the same kind for genetic resistance as a 3 inch long 1-1.5 ounce rodent that seems to want to be want to be anything but a rodent it has the cancer res like bowhead whales and elephants when it\u2019s a tiny wanna be than they work in a eusocial society like ants and bees, they can survive with almost no oxygen like a snake, and even soldiers who are given weapons strictly living for defense like a knight. They must be watching us from the holes",

Like when a new queen takes over she immediately gets successors which one of them will be the next queen and they start to develop ovaries. \n   \u2022 The queen than suppress the reproductive organs in those successors so they don\u2019t go around mating with workers. (I add how in they do this in part 1). \n\n\n**Workers don\u2019t have kids but are left with kids in cases like this:** \n   \u2022 During the queen's reproductive phase, she will typically leave her natal colony and establish a new colony with a group of workers, often her own offspring from previous litters. This process allows the queen to establish her reproductive dominance and continue the cycle of reproduction within the new colony. These workers assist the queen in establishing a new colony. Initially, the offspring of the queen can exhibit both worker and soldier traits. However, as the colony grows and matures, the division of labor becomes more distinct. \n\nIf all the soldiers were to die within a colony, the existing workers would have the ability to assume the soldier role if the need arises. In response to changes in the colony's dynamics or threats from outside forces, workers can undergo physiological and behavioral changes to fulfill the soldier role. This flexibility in their roles allows the colony to adapt to different situations without requiring the birth of new soldiers.\n\n**More info with how a queen takes over**\nThe process of a new queen taking over is known as \"queen succession.\" Queen succession typically occurs when the existing queen becomes incapable of reproducing or dies due to natural causes.\n\n   \u2022 Recognition of the need for a new queen within the colony.\n\n   \u2022 Suppression of reproductive inhibition among potential successor females.\n\n   \u2022 Physiological changes in potential successors, including increased ovarian activity and development of reproductive organs.\nIntense competition among potential successors to establish dominance.\n\n   \u2022 Dominant female emerges through physical aggression and suppressing the reproductive capabilities of others.\n\n   \u2022 The dominant female assumes the role of the new queen and ensures the colony's reproductive continuity.",

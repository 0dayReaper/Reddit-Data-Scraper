            "comment": "I suspect you are asking a **theology** question, not a biology question.\n\nIf you\u2019re asking an **ecology** question\u2014would it be possible today to selectively remove all Diptera while maintaining a similar ecosystem to the one we have now\u2014the answer is it depends on what you mean. Earth\u2019s ecosystem is already under tremendous stress. Diptera probably represent a little less than 2% of the earth\u2019s animal biomass (which is a *huge* proportion) or 0.01% of the earth\u2019s total biomass (which is not so bad). Loss of Diptera would probably have very little impact on the earth\u2019s fungi and bacteria (15% of earth\u2019s biomass) but more on plants (82% of earth\u2019s biomass). We\u2019re on our way to hell in a hand basket anyway. Losing Diptera would push us along the road we\u2019re on faster but it\u2019s the same road. \n\nIf you\u2019re asking an **evolution** question\u2014could earth\u2019s ecosystem have evolved without an order Diptera, the answer is No, by definition. Earth\u2019s ecosystem includes Diptera. You can\u2019t have something that includes Diptera without Diptera. \n\nIt\u2019s also Yes. The ecological niches occupied today by Diptera would be occupied by other animals that evolved to occupy those niches. We wouldn\u2019t necessarily notice much difference between a world with Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera, and a world with Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera occupying the Diptera niches. Instead of little Diptera buzzing on shit and carrion they would be little Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera. And you would be asking why we have Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera. The fact that we have an order Diptera is pure chance. The fact that we have animals that occupy Diptera ecological niches is evolution.",

            "comment": "Because they're very good at continuing to exist. Life does not inherently have to serve a purpose, although it often finds itself occupying a niche - it just has to continue. \n\nPerhaps predators could find substitute food sources for flies. Rotting food and fruit would likely be decomposed and fed on either way: fungi, worms, larger scavengers and an assortment of other insects would probably find it. \n\nBut thing is, flies get there first. So they get to eat first, lay their eggs first, have the maggots hatch first, and therefore flies live on. They might share what we perceive to be a \"purpose\" that other life also fulfills, but flies are very good at it and so they still exist.",

    "postText": "I was learning about the theory of \u201cpolar gigantism\u201d and it\u2019s effects on aquatic life, and I was wondering if it was possible that something similar could happen for humans. The tallest average humans on earth all come from Nordic countries, with exceptions being some sparse tribes in Africa. The stereotype of Icelandic people being giants is also widely known Could cold weather cause a long term evolutionary changes to human anatomy in a similar way that cold water does for animals?",

This is the main tradeoff associated with being warm-blooded. \n\nHigh oxygen availability in polar oceans does not directly affect humans, an air-breathing species.",

The bigger size in these countries is more likely to be due to preferential mate selection over many generations favoring larger individuals.",

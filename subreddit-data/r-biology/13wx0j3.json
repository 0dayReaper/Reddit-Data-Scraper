All are distal bones of limbs (1&amp;3 pair together and 2&amp;4 pair together) probably from a quadruped. (Distal meaning closer to the hands/feet than the trunk of the body). The tibia and fibula look too small/skinny to support the weight of a biped. Also radius and ulna are a little heftier in certain places than an average human\u2019s would be. They are also all relatively the same length which would make sense for a quadruped. Not sure where you live, but if deer are rampant, that\u2019s probably your best bet.

The bones from my picture must have fallen out.\n\nSo at this point I stopped digging and the scarf \"parcel\" is still in the ground with the ends sticking out. I wanted to get some advice before I continue digging..\n\nI've emailed the local police station with the pics, most likely they'll tell me that it's nothing and to stop bothering them but then at least my conscience is clear..",

But that doesn\u2019t look human to me, although an object for scale would help.  Curvature/size looks like a quadruped.  Quadrupeds have thicker and denser arm bones, and those first two look like radius/ulna.  They look too thick and too curved to be human.  I think that\u2019s some kind of hoofed quadruped\n\n https://statemuseum.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/Distinguishing%20Human%20From%20Animal%20Bone%20%28Watson%20and%20McClelland%202018%29.pdf",

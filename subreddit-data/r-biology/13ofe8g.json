            "comment": "Also have a bachelors in Biology. I was lucky enough to get a job in fisheries right out of college. I work for a university. I recommend looking at your university\u2019s website for open positions within the university system (research technician positions). I know a lot of recent graduates that have success going that route. Also, if you have any previous professors you are comfortable emailing, I would reach out to them and see if they know of any openings. Within my university system I know a lot of the tech positions get circulated to the professors to spread the word to their students/previous students. \n\nOutside of the university system, I know that biology jobs are super competitive (they still are within university systems but seem to be a little more obtainable). Working for a state or federal agency is a highly sought after position, so those seem to be the most competitive. \n\nMy best advice is to look at the job posting\u2019s qualifications and make sure you try to check as many of those boxes when you write your cover letter and resume/CV. A lot of hiring committees score candidates based solely on if you mention that you meet that qualification, don\u2019t assume they know. For example, just because you were able to write a good cover letter isn\u2019t the same as saying you have good writing skills. Make sense?\n\nGood luck to you, don\u2019t give up just yet.",

We talked for 3 hours, he agreed to supervise me, and then did. It never occured to me the uni could turn me down. So don't sit around waiting for stuff to come to you. If you want to work in biology, you have to hunt it down. If you don't love it enough to work for love (at least at first), you probably picked the wrong degree. It will help if your idea is low cost. If they don't need to worry about your funding, you are more of a prize, so think local.",

You were never going to get accepted without any of that. Biology is so competitive. \n\nThink about every person that wants to be a vet. Then think about how, if they are smart, have hundreds to thousands of hours as interns or a lower job at that location. Now, that's only for veterinarians.  Some people still go the Biology route for med school. Biology is too vague to just rely on. Whether you like it or not that's who you're competing with. I can't tell you how many of us couldn't get into vet school or med school and just decided, as a LAST RESORT, to go to grad school. We were afforded that opportunity because of the connections we had made and researching opportunities that we jumped at the chance to do. \n\nIf you're going to pursue a career in biology, unfortunately it sounds like you're going to have to start at the bottom-ish... then build your CV and maybe re-apply at a later date.",

Explain the situation. Say you missed out on the career development and contact-cultivation other students were doing senior year. Ask for advice, contacts, resources, etc. Follow up on everything they put forth. Then, do the same thing with the college's career center, alumni association, and the office of the dean of the sub-college or department that houses the biology program. \n\nThen follow up with everyone with whom you went through the program (whose contact info you have). See what they are doing. Ask if they or someone in their work situation (especially someone with some extensive career experience) would be willing to do an informational interview. The goal isn't to get a job there-- it is to learn about all the things people are out there doing with biology degrees, and to then have them refer you to other people who are looking to hire. Me receiving an email from a colleague or acquaintance saying \"be on the lookout for an application from _______, I just met with them and suggested your business as a place where they might fit in,\" is a huge leg up compared to an out-of-the-blue application.\n\nLastly, if you are first generation and of an immigrant group or ethnicity, find any and all trade associations, business groups, social media categories (such as Reddit subs) related to white-collar professionals of that group. No advice I could give will best their lived experience.",

So deep down in the oceans there are thermal vents that are releasing methane and sulfur and other hot geothermal gas- and there were bacteria that were able to use sulfate (SO2) in a reduction reaction to produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as a metabolic end product, and oxygen! Splitting the sulfate into hydrogen sulfide and oxygen over and over as that geothermal gas pumps out of the depths of the ocean- eventually produced an increase of total oxygen concentration in the ocean. And then as other bacteria like Cyanobacteria developed the ability to reduce CO2 by using water as an electron donor.. there was an even larger increase in oxygen production. Eventually the ocean begins filling with oxygen and molecules begin to get pushed out of aqueous solution. As oxygen escaped the ocean it began to fill our atmosphere. And that\u2019s the story of purple/green sulfur bacteria... I think.",

Cyanobacteria can be found on their own in the water and they can also be found inside the other organisms. When you get right down to it all green algae and plants have adopted the machinery of photosynthesis from ancient cyanobacteria. This particular type of photosynthesis only evolved once and everyone else borrowed it.\n\nThe size of plankton varies significantly. On the small side of the scale there are bacteria and viruses. And on the other end of the scale are large animals like jellyfish. The defining characteristic is that the organism can't actively swim fast, far, or long enough to resist the large scale currents that carry it around.",

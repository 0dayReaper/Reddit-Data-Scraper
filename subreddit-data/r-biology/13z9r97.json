            "comment": "They don't know that it doesn't cause inflammation. They know that it can inhibit some inflammatory molecules. \n\nIn general, if you kill cells you cause inflammation. But then again the best result they got was a 50% reduction in cancer growth outside the body with no vasculature or other bodily systems communicating with the tumor. So they really don't know if there would be an inflammatory response or not.\n\nAlso, since cancer is a disease of the genome, and anatomical classifications of cancer don't really describe the underlying root causes, it seems highly unlikely to me that this would be a targeted therapy benign to most healthy cell types but toxic to most cancerous cell types regardless of the genomic mutations. The heterogeneity of cancer cells within a single tumor is pretty remarkable in and of itself which is why it's so incredibly hard for a single therapy to cure any cancer\n\nHopefully, it works, but  all these attention-grabbing cancer cure headlines usually end up as failures and I won't hold my breath waiting for this one to make it to human clinical trials",

    "postText": "Hi everyone - I have the smallest gap in my understanding of the sodium potassium pump and I can't seem to identify it. Could someone please help me figure out where the sodium potassium pump comes into play? Here is my understanding so far: There are separate leak channels throughout which Na+ and K+ flow down their concentration gradient. However, as they flow down their concentration gradient, the electrical gradient causes them to want to flow back to their respective starting points. The point at which the movement of the ions down the concentration gradient is equal to the movement of ions down their electrical gradient is the resting membrane potential of the cell. It is -70mV. Now, my textbook says that the sodium potassium pump is important to maintain this resting potential by moving ions back to where they came from: sodium out of the cell, potassium into the cell. However, I don't understand why the pump is necessary? Don't they already travel back to their starting point through the leak channels as induced by the chemical gradient? Thanks so much - I really appreciate any help!",

            "comment": "The Na/K pump maintains the concentration gradients. This will not occur without Na/K ATPase\n\nIf only the leak channels were there, the ions would flow down their gradients and the gradients would be lost. \n\nThe Na/K pump moves the ions against the concentration gradient, which maintains the gradient\n\nIons do not flow up their concentration gradient; only down. \n\nYou need active transport (ie a pump like Na/K ATPase) to move ions up their gradient\n\nThink about a stone on top of a hill. The stones do not roll up the hill themselves; they need a crane to get them there (crane = Na/K pump in this analogy). The leak channels allow stones to roll down the hill",

                    "comment": "Hi, thank you so much the response! Is this because the leak channels are unidirectional, such that they only allow Na+ to move in and K+ to move out the cell? But as ions want to travel down the electrical gradient back to their starting point they can't use the leak channels and need the Na/K pump to transport them?",

They\u2019re just channels that ions can diffuse through. They appear unidirectional because of the gradients; but are in reality bidirectional \n\nNa/K ATPase establishes and maintains the gradients. It moves 3 atoms of sodium  and 2 atoms of potassium against their concentration gradients. \n\nLeak channels are passive transport; Na/K ATPase is active transport\n\nLeak channels use the energy of the gradients; Na/K ATPase uses the energy of ATP to establish the gradients\n\nLeak channels allow ions to move \u201cdownhill\u201d and Na/K ATPase uses energy to move ions \u201cuphill\u201d\n\nI\u2019d be happy to discuss with you further, if you would like more clarification",

So, the reason why we have more sodium on the outside of the neuron, is not due to the fact that this naturally happens because of the electrical gradient pulling sodium up the concentration gradient? Rather it is because of the Na/K pump?",

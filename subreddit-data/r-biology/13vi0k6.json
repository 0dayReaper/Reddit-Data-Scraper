            "comment": "For the sake of clarity, let's assume the gene in question is \"T\", where \"T\" is dominant and \"t\" is recessive.\r  \n\r  \nAll the shaded people (I-2, II-4, III-1, III-3) have genotype \"tt\". There are both male and female with genotype tt, so it's unlikely it's sex-linked. Since II-3 doesn't have it, we can confirm it's not sex-linked and is therefore autosomal.\r  \n\r  \nIn order for II-4 to be tt, both parents have to have at least one recessive copy to pass down: I-2 is tt; I-1 is Tt.\r  \n\r  \nIn order for III-1 and III-3 to be tt, again, both parents have to have at least one recessive copy to pass down: II-1 is Tt, II-2 is Tt, II-5 is Tt.\r  \n\r  \nBecause we see that only one person with tt in generation II, and two in generation III, we know this is a recessive trait (autosomal recessive).\r  \n\r  \nHope that helps, and thanks for the genetics question :)",

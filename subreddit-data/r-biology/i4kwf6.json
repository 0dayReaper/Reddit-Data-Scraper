It is held open by turgor pressure, until the hairs are triggered and the pressure is released. It then has to reset the leaf, which might involve growing the leaf some again, but certainly puts wear on the leaf.\n\n           In sensitive plant leaves the change is also caused by turgor pressure, but gravity is doing much of the work. The leaves aren't growing to put themselves under pressure like a spring, as with the Venus flytrap. It simply folds the leaflets along the axis with gravity, much less wear and tear.\n       ( Yay plant biology degree \ud83d\ude02)",

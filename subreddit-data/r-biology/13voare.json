            "comment": "The centromere is not a structure, but a region of specific chromatin that allows multiple proteins to assemble into kinetochores and serves as a site for sister chromatids attachment. \n\nThe cohesin complex of proteins at the centromere is what holds the sister chromatids together. This complex is located \u00ab\u00a0in the middle\u00a0\u00bb of the centromere, while the kinetochore is \u00ab\u00a0on the outside\u00a0\u00bb. During anaphase, only the cohesin part is degraded, allowing the sister chromatids to be separated and drawn by their kinetochore to opposite poles of the spindle. \n\nThe schematic shows the microtubules holding the chromatids by interacting with the kinetochore portion of the centromere. \n\nRead about it [here](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/chromosome-segregation-in-mitosis-the-role-of-242/).",

Consider the protein complex cohesin, which keeps the centromere together. This protein is broken down into smaller parts - amino acids and tiny protein chains called polypeptides. This breakdown is done by a special type of protein called an enzyme. In the case of cohesin, the enzyme doing the job is called separase.",

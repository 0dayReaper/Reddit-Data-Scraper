            "comment": "Hard to give any recommendations, as you don't seem to have a particular branch of biology that you're interested in. Most university programs (?) will walk you through a bunch of the different fields of biology for the first 2-3 years, and then let you choose electives depending on what you find interesting. Though this depends on what your degree is in, biology, ecology, molecular biology, biomedicine etc.",

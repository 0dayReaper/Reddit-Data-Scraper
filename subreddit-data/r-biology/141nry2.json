            "comment": "In many ways the immune system and how it acts is like a bunch of mini-orchestras in any given tissue and state of infection/inflammation. Much of the last century has been the discovery of markers on the surface of cells that has allowed scientists to identify the cell\u2019s identity and function. For instance CD3(cluster of differentiation 3) is a classic marker for T cells, CD20 for B cells, and hundreds more. Scientists have cracked a lot of the developmental pathways of stem cells and continue to discover which factors need to be present to drive functional maturation of these cells in the lab, but the body is much more complex. \n\nTo add to the complexity. Our understanding of each cells has been limited to the number of cell markers of which labs have discovered and determined the function. There are so many flavors of T cells, B cells, NK cells, (lymphocytes) myeloid cells, amyloid cells, etc., so it is important to understand at the individual cellular level what characteristics each cell has and how it contributes to any given setting. \n\nCrazy idea for you to chew on. There is speculation that the same immune program that sets in near the womb of a pregnant woman that will protect the fetus from being seen as \u201cother\u201d by the mother\u2019s immune system has similarities to how some solid cancer tumors manipulate the programming of immune cells to escape early and sustained detection. Every day your body is fighting cancer, it is just the cells that escape detection or ignore the immune systems request for self-death(apoptosis). \n\nThe map of all the flavor of cells is the first step to understanding all the possibilities and function of the immune system. The next is a Venn diagram of how they functionally overlap and then how they orchestrate a response in given situations. Then consider in the setting of a disease that impairs a part of the immune system, what changes? Which population disappears, which population compensates and fills the void? Which growth factors disappear and may be needed to restore the immune system\u2026 all of these things are being studied every day, all the time, because it has implications in cancer treatments, etc.\n\nSorry for the long winded response, but that is my take. Only until recently have we had the ability to look at so many markers and get such refined information from single cells.",

If you know which parts of DNA do what in terms of their function, you can build loads of cool DNA devices to fulfil some system requirement. \n\nSo if you wanted to build a sensor that detects X, you could construct on operon using the relevant DNA parts. For example, if you found an inducible promotor sequence that was sensitive to X, you could build an operon containing the inducible promotor, a ribosome binding sequence, a GFP coding sequence, and a terminator -  when X activates the promotor, green fluorescent protein will be made. \n\nThese bits of DNA can be taken from a\ndifferent cell via PCR amplification, or you could get them synthesised, which is generally more expensive. \n\nThis work probably isn\u2019t achievable from home. You\u2019d need a centrifuge, an electrophoresis kit, and a whole host of chemicals and enzymes to do it.",

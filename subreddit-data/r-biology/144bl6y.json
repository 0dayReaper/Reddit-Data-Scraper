            "comment": "According to what it says on the right side, the answer should be the same kind of curve you see for mice and voles, but the number of owls is much lower than the numbers of their prey, so the line has to be below the one already in the graph. The shape reflects the relationship between them, so if there's more owls, there's less mice, because they get eaten, and less owls means more mice. So the graph should be the opposite of the existing line. Does that make sense?",

Since the predator-population is now rather low, the prey-population will start to rise again. With a high population of prey, the population of predators will increase. This goes on and on.",

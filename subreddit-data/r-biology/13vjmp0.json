    "postText": "Recently, I\u2019ve been noticing that many people and institutions in society become resistant to certain behaviors for the reason that those behaviors might limit procreation (for instance, discriminatory sentiment against gay or childless individuals and refusal of doctors to sterilize healthy, consenting individuals). There is also this widely-held idea that survivors would be obligated to procreate following a near extinction event of the human species (\u201ca duty to continue the species\u201d). Phenomena such as these social conventions make me wonder as to the self-preservation drive of a species, how that drive is experienced, and what constitutes it.\n\nI know that nearly dying in a dangerous situation may temporarily increase libido in some species, humans included, but do humans sincerely feel the need to \u201ccontinue the species\u201d beyond that? Is there some visceral reaction to the prospect of human extinction even if this doesn\u2019t imply the unnatural or sudden deaths of those around oneself? Furthermore, if the human species dwindles to the point where effective repopulation becomes impossible, improbable, or even just highly detrimental to the individual survivors, would people still desire obligatorily to repopulate?",

Wanting the entire species to survive aids cooperation and increases overall fitness. \n\nThen there\u2019s how we choose to describe why we want this. If you ask someone \u201cwhy do you want to continue the species?\u201d they may give you their rationalisation.\n\n///\n\nThen there\u2019s the philosophical question of \u201cdo we have some moral imperative to continue the species for its own sake?\u201d, that\u2019s more of an ethical question.

I don't judge people negatively who want or have children but I genuinely can't justify creating humans that are going to have to deal with the fallout of past generations. It's not a pleasant feeling when thinking about what the environment will probably look like in their lifetimes or the kinds of heavy decisions that would fall on them to make because I chose to have them. Maybe if I see an incredible change in the course of humanity I'll reconsider but I don't expect that to happen while I'm still in a reproductive age category. It seems selfish to have kids that at this point are far more likely to live in a world with worse, large-scale problems than the one's I'm struggling with now. Maybe things will be better in a couple more generations but I'm just not that set on passing on my genes.",

I just have /my/ understanding of the biological drive vs societal drive.\n\nHumans are unique in that we have the ability to control our procreation drive through multiple means, whereas lower animals don't. It's an interesting topic, especially when you can have an honest discussion with others",

We have lived under quite difficult conditions and been few individual humans alive during some parts of our history and we still had children.   \n\n\nThat said, I think it\u2019s rude to tell people that they should have children if they don\u2019t want to - some people don\u2019t have that drive and some people don\u2019t have the ability. There are enough people who actually want to have children, so we should focus on making it easier for them to find stable partners and have children.",

I\u2019m doing IVF and have been in this process for a couple of years, so the longing for a baby or child of my own certainly gets stronger when I see someone else\u2019s - especially if they look like what I imagine my child would look like. There is also a protectiveness that I feel for children, which I think most other people feel as well. Since children can\u2019t take care of themselves (and are cute), I feel a need to keep them safe. If I would see a child confused and alone, I would intervene. I would probably not do that if I saw an adult act that way. Is there a part of that that\u2019s about feeling comforted about the success of my species? Maybe. Yes, probably.   \n\n\nIf my close relatives have children in the future, even if I don\u2019t, that would make me feel more comforted. I feel an attachment to people who I\u2019m closely related to, which is independent of how much time I\u2019ve spent with them. There was one relative that I didn\u2019t see for many years and hadn\u2019t seen much before those years either, but after some issues resolved, I now see her more often. I feel the same kind of attachment to her that I feel to other relatives. The attachment that develops from spending time with someone is something separate.",

It seems more likely that creatures smart enough to create a technological civilization extinguish themselves before they evolve to be smart enough not to.  But there's also the possibility that the universe just isn't old enough to have spawned many civilizations at this point and that technological civilizations are very rare.  Many places in the galaxy would be poorly suited for allowing complex life to evolve.",

However, when it comes to the OP's question, I don't think the need to assure the existence of the species is intrinsic in the human mind. It does make sense, from a biological point of view, and it's definitely true for a lot of people, but our ability to reflect on our urges makes us unpredictable.",

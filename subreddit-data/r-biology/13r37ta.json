In my school, you cant take AP bio if you dont take chemistry, but i rlly wanna study physics too so im not sure whether i should try switching to chemistry or continue physics. Which should i choose?",

A lack of chemistry knowledge catches me often - always has - and was a weight on my learning of even basic EMS level health science. \n\nI cared little for the physics of high school (I care less for maths so\u2026) but even if I\u2019d loved it I\u2019ve not missed learning more.\n\nHonestly I wish Chemistry had been mandatory or at least a bigger part of the earlier material around my time and parts.",

I personally chose AP Bio over AP physics but I had already taken chemistry. AP Bio will be a great introductory course to help you decide if you want to continue studying it into college.",

I guess i could do physics next year and chemistry after that to take AP bio, but i dont think that would look good for my college app considering i wouldnt be taking ap physics or ap chem",

If you want AP classes on your transcript, then doing chem and then AP bio probably is good. But as long as you do well in the classes, you\u2019re gonna be fine either way.",

    "postText": "So I just learned about the cardiovascular system. With the arteries that carry blood away from your heart(I also know the 3 layers of their walls) then the arterioles that follow up(branches off from the arteries) that carry blood to tissues/organs. But before the blood reaches the tissues/organs they go into capillaries. I also know that before blood flows into the capillaries they pass precapillary sphincters(They control blood flow from arterioles into capillaries)and that happens with vasoconstriction and vasodilation. I also learned about aneurysm. Is there something else important I need to know ? I know the lymphatic system and veins but I still need to learn them. But from the blood transport of arteries -&gt; arterioles -&gt; capillaries. Do I know the important stuff, or did I forget something ?",

            "comment": "Capillaries have a single layer compared to arterioles and arteries, so that gas exchange can occur. You already mentioned arteries carry away from the heart, so that is good you won't get caught up in color. Lots of students often think arteries always are red, but that isn't the definition as pulmonary arteries and veins have flipped colors. \n\nDepends how in depth you need to go and for what kind of class. \ud83d\ude1d I used to tutor health care students and taught workshops, so we sometimes got in depth with things.",

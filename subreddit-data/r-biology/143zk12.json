How much wealth and power will you pass on to your children's children? How much will a psychiatric illness affect your ability to have a stable home?\n\nThe selection effects are subtle but this isn't uncommon among social creatures. Natural selection involves intergenerational aspects as much as individual effects. Sexual selection will then greatly amplify those effects and drive evolution even as our environments continually become safer.\n\nNot to mention, global warming is going to be pretty dicey for humanity.\n\nEdit: It has been brought to my attention through this incoherent nonsense below that some believe natural selection *is* social darwinism. It is not. Natural selection can occur through slight pressures or advantages afforded through genetics over an extremely long time period, meaning a handful of genes may increase in frequency among a local population. Or in rare cases, it can provide a crucial edge to afford advantages to children where a condition might otherwise make it extremely difficult to provide. This is how evolution can still act on humans, and thus we are subject to natural selection. Natural selection doesn't mean selection for death or life. It is the process by which genes can become more or less common (i.e. selected by environment).",

I asked her about it and stayed after class for a good 45 mins to an hour. That discussion really ignited my love for genetics and mutations. \n\nAs for Gattaca, I think it\u2019s a worthwhile discussion about eugenics and where the human genome project was heading when they started their journey in 1990. It\u2019s a 1997 film made right in the middle of the project so I expect the movie took it and ran with the creative process. (Ofc eugenics=bad). Helping with diseases and color blindness with CRISPR though\u2026 \n\n{Sorry I\u2019m on mobile idk how this will be formatted. It\u2019s like 3am and I\u2019m not hopping on my pc}",

What does it even mean, and how would that make the flowers from different species sprout from the same vine?\n\n\"The plants must've gotten the hox genes!\" she says, when seeing the human-shaped branches. Inserting hox genes in plants would likely produce no effect whatsoever, and definitely not make plants human.\n\nI think that the conceptual idea of Annihilation is interesting, but the writing of the would-be scientists make it a 2/10.",

I'm not talking about ionizing radiation causing cancer, but about having a character open someone's guts and find them rolling snakes or tentacles, people turing into plants, or characters switching arms with each other.  Conscious forces manipulating light could change how we *perceive* physical objects, but shouldn't change the matter itself, at least not at the Newtonian level.\n\nThree, and the most unforgivable: this movie managed to make phosphorus grenades boring. *How do you even manage that?!?*",

The plot is that science can determine your limits, but our hero can, by just gritting his teeth and wishing, exceed those limits. That means either the science is wrong and the whole basis of the society is crazy as a result, or our hero is wrong, and the position of responsibility he seeks that requires certain physiological traits will be one he can\u2019t actually fulfill, thereby culpably killing hundreds. But the film illogically insists both are true. Then it rounds off with a wonderful coda of \u201clook at these nice people who would\u2019ve died if we had eugenics\u201d. But we don\u2019t have eugenics, don\u2019t want it, don\u2019t believe we can predict job-worthiness from gene sequences, and equally don\u2019t believe we can overcome genetic disease just by trying hard. A movie with a message, and that message is \u201cOoh, DNA sounds scary. Let\u2019s get a bunch of arts graduates together to demonise it\u201d",

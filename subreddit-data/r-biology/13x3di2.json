The only thing most qualifications mean is that the average college student can outwit the cleverest cop. Most scientists are slaves to public opinion despite what the facts show, and rely on the authority of a flawed peer-review process; these \"professionals\" present their beliefs and opinions as facts or policies. Like the police, they welcome trumped-up classifications and assertions so they can further extort and intrude on the public, just like plastic surgeons will shill for each other for unneeded surgeries on RealSelf.",

My IQ is over 170; I can read and write in Roman, Hell\u00e8nic, C\u00fdrillic, Qhibi\u0155iqht, Qh\u00e0\u0155\u00e0bihh, and IPA staves; I can read up to 2700 w/min. I took two years each of physics, chemistry, and anthropology and maths up to linear algebra. I grew up with a supermarket dictionary and encyclopedia set, Wiktionary, Wikipedia, and other googled resources; that and teachers were my best friend. I didn't socialize with my peers; they were all beneath me. I went to college at 11 and 12, qualified for every entry level class, but left due to astigmatism \\[which after adult college I got rid of by pressing on my lenses\\]. When I first found Wikipedia and Wiktionary and other resources I had a nervose breakdown on how often, broadly, and deeply badly-written, contradictory, and cognitively-dissonant their explanations were.\n\nYou are the kind of person I face every time I take over what is right\u2014being an inimitable, incorrigible, prodigious savant who is taking over the world\u2014someone who thinks I can be taken down using the pitiful, common background of mankind. I know and ken more than ye put together, and I'm likely younger too. You don't sound like a reader, and the repetitive hretoric in your comments doesn't further the topic.

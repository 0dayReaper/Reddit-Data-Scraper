Etymology can be a interesting as entomology though, and I thought it would be a fun play on the words, since both have the suffix -ptera from the ancient Greek for wing, rather than odonata from the tooth like structures on dragonfly mandibles. Taxa are rather a subjective measure anyway, prone as they are to redefinition, so the argument is a bit of a curate's egg.",

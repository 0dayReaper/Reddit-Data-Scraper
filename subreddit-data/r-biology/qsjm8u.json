Personally I've seen many surgeries and am absolutely appreciative of the accuracy and work that went into this book... I refrain from using words like beauty from things like this because; in my mind words like that are of a sexual nature... Which is why I compared someone who thinks human organs and bones are beautiful might have a desire to see peoples entrails... I welcome more down votes but I still recommend finding different language in the future.",

I get to illustrate everything from anatomy to microbio to pharm, so I spend a lot of time learning and researching, which is the best. I've also done a lot of patient education side-jobs (eg. post-partum return to exercise illustrations, a series of illustrations showing the benefits of conscious breathing, etc) and one of my side-hustles last year during grad school was illustrating papers for my university's ortho department.   \nRight out of undergrad I worked in neuro and then oncology research, which just kinda underscored how generally bad scientists are at communicating about science to non-scientists, so I wanted to figure out a job tat might help bridge the gap. Also I didn't feel a great enough love of research to get a PhD. Medical illustration/animation really fit the bill.",

Which variations are normal to blue jays and which might define a new jay species? Artists renderings help to show what make a particular species unique without showing an individual who will have variations that may not be representative for the whole species. Just one example of why bio-artists are needed.) Then it was all computers and crisp bright representations that lose something in translation.

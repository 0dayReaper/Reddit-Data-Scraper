    "postText": "I have eosinophilic esophagitis which causes me to be allergic to a myriad of different foods, all of which cause non-life threatening reactions. One inconsistent allergy I\u2019ve noticed over the years is my reaction to bananas. I noticed that it was 50/50 whether I would have a reaction or not, and even got an allergy test which was actually for something other than bananas, but supposedly would test positive if I was allergic to bananas. It tested negative, yet I definitely feel my esophagus swelling and tightening when I eat bananas half the time. What I have come to realize is that the older the banana is (as in its been left on the counter for several days and gains brown spots) is that I will have a stronger allergic reaction to it. But if the banana is pure yellow, it doesn\u2019t affect me. Does anyone know what could be causing this?",

If it's just bananas, it has to be some kind of unusual byproduct that accumulates as chemical reactions that cause ripening occur. Seems unlikely it could be something common to most ripening fruits like ethylene or fructose.",

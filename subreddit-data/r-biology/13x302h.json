    "postText": "I mess with many different species of jumping spiders very often, some of which are certainly big enough to break through my skin with their fangs, but they never bite me. Surely my manhandling them is stressful and seen as a threat, so why don\u2019t they ever bite me? They just seem curious about me, but surely spiders don\u2019t have the intelligence required for what I know as curiosity, do they?",

Also dial down the speciesism by insulting their intelligence\u2026or are you skilled at hiding, camouflaging and then jumping on a pig or small cow and eating it. If you are intelligent enough to get all your nourishment that way then forgive me \ud83e\udd23\n\nEdit: I have so NOT researched this",

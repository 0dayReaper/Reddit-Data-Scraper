It looks like they did metagenomics on environmental samples from reefs and found a ton of new species(go figure, that happens every time you do  metagenomics), which changes their estimates for total microbial diversity of reefs so much that their model now says reefs have more biodiversity than the rest of the earth combined, which sounds odd intuitively. In short, more science is needed to collect more data and make better models, nothing new here :p",

But I'm thinking someone may have done some analysis on the average time for a generation for similar species to ones in our lineage.  It seems like a logical thing for a biologist to study since a meaningful genomic change can only occur once per generation.",

Unless there is a significant generational pattern (structural factor of the generation) that causes a significant population change in evolutionary trajectory that would be something to study.\n\nI\u2019m tried rn but I liked the question.",

I'm really just trying to get a feel for how many opportunities for phylogenetic iteration there have been that have led to us from each of these major junctures.  I know that there must have been a lot, but I just don't really know enough to put together some kind of estimate.  It seems like the kind of estimate someone may have put together at some point, though.",

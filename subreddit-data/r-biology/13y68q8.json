    "postText": " \n\nI currently have shotgun metagenome data. I quality-filtered reads at Q30 and employed Kaiju and GOTTCHA2 using default parameters.\n\nMy sample is marine water. And yes, I know phages are more abundant than bacteria. This is my first time seeing reads-based taxonomic profile with almost 90% of reads belonging to phages! Is this a cause of alarm? Or it is just phages dominate my sample?\n\nI've handled wastewater samples before which are more known to harbor A LOT of phages but the reads suggested that there are still more bacteria than phages.\n\nI'm still waiting for my metagenome assembly to corroborate whether an assembly-based approach would recapitulate my assembly-free taxonomic profile.\n\nAny comments would be appreciated! Comments on how I may go about, literature to read, or whatever.\n\nThanks!",

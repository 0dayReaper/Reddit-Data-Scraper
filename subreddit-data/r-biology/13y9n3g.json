            "comment": "Your lab experience in your undergrad is enough for many government entry level lab tech positions through DES or other branches. Those can be a great way to get your foot in the door, though those positions in particular can be fairly monotonous. It\u2019s a great way to plan future moves because you can work for a year while searching out other relevant positions and then not reapply to the gov job when the time comes around (if you have found another position to go for). Alleviates resume gap, bolsters some skills, and shows you have lab experience. Those jobs are also fairly secure in that you generally always have an idea of when the job will have an end point, they let you transition to similar/higher positions all over the place if you want, and if you end up enjoying it and sticking around you can be set with a decent salary and a pension. The extra bonus is that the extra bureaucratic density in government positions ensures you don\u2019t work crazy hours without being compensated. Vacation time/time off can feel strict though (still better than a lot of other places).",

    "postText": "So, just out of curiousity, what omnivore consumes the most amount of calories compared to it's size? Some glimpse for this context is I am trying to figure out what animal simultaneously has the most diverse diet and requires the most calories to sustain itself. Probably potentially hard to track, which is why I settled on omnivores(scavengers would also be welcome, but not \"decomposers\" looking at primary consumers). The purpose for this is more on the fictional side, but wanted some analgous and solid grounding.",

While gluttonous does I guess imply overeatting what is nessisary, I think even then we would have the Sorex and the Elephant Shrew, but they are only insectivorous. Other contenders so far would have been some Mustalid like Wolverines and the \"Sus\" genus(pigs dominesticated or otherwise), but mostly from the Vareity over the shrews, even if the Sorex and Elephant Shrews eat more(for their size). But, the Humming Bird also beats the shrews in amount of calories required.",

Although the Trochylids do eat both plant matter and various bugs, which I could reason the other might fit the variety of food which tends to be attributed to Omnivores and Scavengers.\n\nEdit: I seem to be finding mixed information on the Sorex, some just say they are Insectivorous, and some say they eat both insects and plant matter. So, the Trochylids might be what I am looking for if this is true?",

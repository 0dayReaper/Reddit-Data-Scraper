At one part, the host walked a beach and made and made a \u201cdress\u201d of all the tampon applicators they picked up. Too many people flushing nonfluahable plastic applicators! Crazy when cardboard works just as well.\nIt was such a great documentary and covered all aspects of menstruation and related hormones.\nWish I could find it again.",

Now why it is showing up in huge patches is a mystery.  My guess is with the recent huge Sargasso blooms, the grass could have had the light smothered out by the patches on top of it, killing it, and sending it floating to the surface.",

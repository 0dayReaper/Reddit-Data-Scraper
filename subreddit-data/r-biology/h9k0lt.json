Most of the time, if you think about it, when high winds occur during dandelion propagation season, it\u2019s raining. Dandelions would not be able to spread their progeny as easily if the seeds became wet and were unable to be lifted into the air via the wind. This would potentially lead to their ultimate extinction but luckily, the dandelions that had a gene for hydrophobic seeds ultimately lead the pack for their successful reproduction these days.",

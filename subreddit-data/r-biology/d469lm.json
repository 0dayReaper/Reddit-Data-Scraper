It appears the behaviour is normal, but the description in the OP is wrong as to what is going on.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N18ce6nLHwo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N18ce6nLHwo)",

They're not exactly rare in that area, but they aren't common to see because they don't hang out near easy access areas too often, so this was sort of a unique opportunity. We got ahead, and had lost sight of it, but we knew we were in the right area when all of the sudden this terrifying bird comes swooping down out of the sky and just barely misses us. It did NOT make the noise I thought it would, the eagle sound is a lie! They make this weird chattering sound that sounds like it's coming from a much smaller bird. But, this one was pretty obviously pissed because it kept swooping down on us. My small primitive mammal brain kicked in at this dinosaur trying to eat me, and I hauled it out of there, ate shit twice on rocks, smashed the small tablet I was using, but we got away and it didn't follow us.\n\nI told the wildlife biologist when we got back, and she just laughed at us and said we were probably by its nest.",

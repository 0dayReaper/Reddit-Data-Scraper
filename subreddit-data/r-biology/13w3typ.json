(Had 18 years in when I left, quite a few raises) Took my 3rd Health Inspector job at my local health department. (Got the job 2 other times in different counties but pay wasn't there). It's a good job but stressful. Pay is decent.",

Went to grad school for an MPH (public health)\u2026that was cool for a while. After like 9 years I didn\u2019t like that anymore\u2026went BACK to grad school for an MA in School Counseling\u2026now I work in a high school as a counselor. Just know\u2026with a foundation in biology, you do have a good number of options! Best wishes!",

It is common for CRCs to transition to either site management or the CRA route after a few years. CRAs usually start at around 60k, but can get up into the low 100k range fairly quickly. Feel free to DM if you have questions about either role.",

    "postText": "I know it's \"good hygiene\" to wash your reusable water bottle regularly, but I wonder how scientifically based this is? If I have a stainless steel water bottle that I only use for water, how could bacteria or mold really thrive if there are no nutrients in the water bottle? Of course, there will be micro-organisms in it to some extent like any non-sterile surface, but can they really proliferate to the point of causing problems for me?",

Bacteria don\u2019t need much to grow a little biofilm. If you put it by a window you might even start growing photosynthetic bacteria and get a whole ecosystem going.",

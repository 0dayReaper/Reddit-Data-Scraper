Not saying it's right for him or his company to seek a patent for the results but most academic research is funded by public money so the results should be public in comparison to companies which are usually funded by investors. The idea is that they patent the genome or patent sections of DNA that are potential therapeutic targets in a similar way that drug companies patent molecules which are therapeutically active. Again, not sure I agree that it should be right to patent the human genome but that person responding to J Craig Venter left out a lot of nuance for the easy Twitter dunk.",

The deciding factor is that the invention's purity must be different from that which occurs in nature, and this level of purity provides *utility* beyond what can be achieved with what occurs in nature. So if I made a 99%-pure drug (of isolated compound X) and it only ever exists in nature at a much lower purity/concentration, it is patentable.\n\nAspirin pills are useful for pain relief in a way that leaves from a Spiraea shrub aren't.",

A group of organic farmers, in fact, recently sued Monsanto, asserting that GMOs might contaminate their crops and then Monsanto might accuse them of patent infringement. **The farmers couldn't cite a single instance in which this had happened, though, and the judge dismissed the case.**\n\n&gt;The idea, however, is inspired by a real-world event. Back in 1999, Monsanto sued a Canadian canola farmer, Percy Schmeiser, for growing the company's Roundup-tolerant canola without paying any royalty or \"technology fee.\" Schmeiser had never bought seeds from Monsanto, so those canola plants clearly came from somewhere else. But where?\n\n...\n\n&gt;he'd actually **sprayed Roundup on about three acres of the field that was closest to a neighbor's Roundup Ready canola.** Many plants survived the spraying, showing that they contained Monsanto's resistance gene \u2014 and when Schmeiser's hired hand harvested the field, months later, he kept seed from that part of the field and used it for planting the next year.\n\n&gt;This convinced the judge that Schmeiser **intentionally** planted Roundup Ready canola. \n\n\nDon't intentionally spray your crops with roundup to select for the ones carrying the gene and you're golden. \n\n\"Intent\" is the important part here. \n\nYou've been fed bollox.",

During that time, Myriad was charging around $4,000 for testing these two genres, while testing of other genes in the same time period was way cheaper. Around 2010 they stayed doing an additional analysis of the genes, at first only if the patient's insurance would cover it. (Think for a moment how fucked up that is). Then they started also offering it to people who wanted to pay almost $500 more. But there was no condition so they could do whatever they wanted. Literally within minutes of the Supreme Court announcement at least one lab updated their site to show they offered testing at way lower costs. \n\n\nToday, cost for testing of those genes along with many other genes associated with cancer risk (in a single test) now is about $250 to $1500, doing on the lab, what genes, etc.\n\n\nEven though they can no longer justify their insane cost and price had been lowered, Myriad now does not share any of theiri variant data, something unique among genetic labs. While more people getting tested by other labs will eventually recreate all that data, in the meantime patients and families are adversely affected. But if they can't make money of the patents anymore, they gotta do it somehow, and now they claim they are worth the extra cost because of all that data they are holding. God forbid they actually participate in contributing to the genetic knowledge base like literally every other lab, especially considering all the patients who were unable to get testing in the part because Myriad is greedy.",

I \u201cgive it away for free\u201d in the sense that I file no patents and tell the world how to make it and administer it.\n\nNow, we have to test that drug to make sure it\u2019s safe and effective. That means clinical trials. Stage 1, 2, and 3 at minimum. This costs many millions of dollars. Who is going to pay for that?\n\nNow it\u2019s gone through clinical trials and we know it\u2019s safe and effective. Yay!\n\nBut the catch is that it costs $100k per dose to produce. No price gouging, just the break even cost of making it. Who is going to pay for that?\n\nObviously patients can\u2019t do that. Obviously philanthropy can\u2019t do that. There are really only two options: government and private business. \n\nIf your answer is government, then you are putting the entire health care industry from drug production to distribution to care to payment under the umbrella of a government bureaucracy. This goes way beyond socialized health insurance. This is a communist system, pure and simple. And we know from theory and history that communist systems cannot distribute resources as effectively and efficiently as capitalist ones. The result of \u201ctrying this\u201d would be akin to the mass starvations that occurred in China during Mao\u2019s Great Leap Forward, except with medicine. People will be dying of easily curable diseases because some government official sent the drugs to the wrong city based on internal predictions that were slightly off. \n\nThat leaves us with only one option: private business. Which needs to be driven by incentives. You can argue about how incentives should be structured and what rules should be put in place to regulate the market. And those are critical discussions to have.\n\nBut removing incentives altogether or redesigning the whole system from the ground up is not only never going to happen, it is a dangerous idea that doesn\u2019t even work in theory.",

Most knowledge come from academic research, companies weight in for clinical trials. There are things half way between free market and communism. For example, the state is making a call for private contractors to make clinical trials, and gives the contract to the best bidder, this way the trial is not handled by inefficient state administration. It's expensive, but states definitely have that kind of money, and it's just an investment not a donation (otherwise pharma investors wouldnt do it either). Then you also get contractors, public call and private offers, for production and distribution. In most of Europe, the state-managed healthcare (i.e. taxes) ends up paying the drugs in the end, so the loop is closed, overall process costs nearly the same but you just save the money that would have gone to pharma investors as being less taxes instead. \n\nThis model is not that ridiculous: it's pretty much what happens with say aerospace military equipment in the US for example. Largely public research (nasa), and state contracts with private companies doing the job when it's more efficient (spaceX), and everything runs smoothly.",

This goes way beyond socialized health insurance. This is a communist system, pure and simple.\n\nThis seems like a non-sequitur to me. Under a communist system, nobody but the government is *allowed* to produce and distribute goods such as medicine. Far as I can tell, that's not what we're discussing; we're discussing the justification for medical patents. In a system without medical patents, private enterprises for developing and producing drugs could, and would, still be a thing. The difference is just that nobody would be allowed to claim things they invent and prevent anyone else from using them without paying, because there'd be no legally sanctioned mechanism for it.\n\nObviously this would undermine much of the current model for how medical companies make their money, removing some of the existing profit motive for developing new products. But the incentive to invent new products so that you can then go on to produce and sell them would still exist.\n\nI work in basic research, where, unlike in applied research/R&amp;D, there's no way to patent the stuff you produce, and yet there is massive productivity of ideas - ideas that are immediately iterated on by other people, free of charge, once they're out there. Basic researchers have to compete for funding from both public sources (taxes) and private sources (research foundations) based on good research proposals and previous merits. I'm not saying it's a perfect system, but it generates a lot of ideas, and it would obviously be applicable to applied research such as medicine as well.",

Most of the stuff that's published does not benefit the researchers or universities in a direct financial way. Sure, there are patents.

Hell, when I did research myself (ecology) the incentive was to just learn new stuff and make the world a better place. The majority of researchers are not in it for the money.\n\nThis is not communism in the Soviet-was-bad kind of way \u2013 rather, it's how much of science has been conducted since more or less forever. The reason pharmaceutical companies do their thing differently is that we let them, plain and simple. There's money to be made on sick people because of the laws that we have made. There's less money to be made on e.g. climate science or experimental ecology, so that stuff is financed by the government. Doesn't mean it's not expensive, nor that it's not useful. People obviously do that kind of research, despite a lack of lucrative patents.  \n\nAs for not even working in theory, much of the current research on bacteriophages is based on stuff done in the USSR (to name but one example). So it's obviously possible for good pharmaceutical research to be produced under communism. Even if we assume all kinds of socialism inevitably leads to that particular form of socialism.",

No, researchers pay to get their papers published, and the money from subscriptions and reprints goes to the journal. Many of the open access journals are free or extremely low price to publish in, which in turn causes a lot of trash to get published in them, which means there's little respect for papers published only that way.

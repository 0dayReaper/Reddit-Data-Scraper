Say it starts out as two species. One is a parasite with male/female mating and a host whose main reproductive strategy is parthenogenesis. As an adaptive strategy the host species starts kicking off its own reproduction a little sooner if it detects infection from the parasite. It gives birth to its own offspring then gives \"birth\" to the parasite. After a few generations of being parasitized the host becomes so dependent on the strategy that it can't reproduce without the signal from the parasite.",

They had male/female/apex sexes where the apex acted as an intermediary between the other two sexes.\n* Pierson's Puppetters in Niven's Known Space novels were herbivores that used a male/female/gestator 3-sex model. I think it is alluded to in one of the later ringworld novels (the sequels are awful don't bother reading them) that the gestator was non-sentient and was not a puppeteer. \n\nFirst off, parasites that use sexual reproduction are parasitizing a different species, not a different sex of their own species. So it's still two sexes. There isn't much of a case for having a third sex since two is more than adequate for producing the randomizing effect that makes sexual reproduction worthwhile. As as a matter of species design, if you don't want to gestate the children within the body of the female... there is always egg laying, which has tradeoffs of its own.",

            "comment": "As another answer alluded to, plants have something like three sexes: they alternate generations between *gametophytes*, which have a single set of chromosomes and (in land plants) come in two sexes, male and female; and *sporophytes*, which have two sets of chromosomes and spontaneously produce gametophytes by meiosis.\n\nIt\u2019s as if an egg cell, rather than waiting to be fertilized before developing, started dividing and developing into a multicellular organism with only one set of chromosomes all by itself, and sperm cells did the same. Then those two organisms would get together, mate, and produce an organism with two sets of chromosomes.\n\n(In modern land plants, one of the two generations is highly reduced and dependent on the other. In mosses, what you see is the gametophyte, whereas in higher land plants, the gametophyte is reduced. In ferns, the gametophyte is a small, free-living organism, but in seed plants, the gametophyte consists of only a few cells, and the female gametophyte spends its entire life cycle enclosed within the parent sporophyte; the male gametophytes are the pollen grains.)\n\nAlternation of generations in a free-living, sentient, animal-like alien species would present a whole host of interesting possibilities for sci-fi plot lines. One generation would reproduce sexually, but the next would just produce offspring spontaneously. One generation would be subject to sexual selection, but the next would not. Family dynamics would be very different from ours.\n\nMaybe the asexual generation could even have a radically different lifestyle. Because it doesn\u2019t need to go looking for a mate, it could even be sessile, rooted to one spot, if it had a way to get enough food.",

Ie, lineages of asexual multicellular organisms don't survive more than a few million years, they're all evolutionary dead ends. The best hypothesis I've seen to account for this is that the constant gene mixing of sex exposes new combinations of genes to selective forces, and in particular, new combinations of cellular self-identifying and immune response genes, that help populations have enough molecular diversity to survive infectious pathogens.  \n\nBut does 3 or 4 (etc.) sexes offer any benefits for gene mixing or preservation of genetic diversity over 2? They'd have to be quite substantial for third sex to survive evolution. I don't think so.  In your hypothetical, with 2 sexes that contribute genes and 1 that doesn't, what do the genes of the 'gestator' get out of a such a relationship? How does that role, as offspring incubator, benefit the genes of the incubator?\n\nIn the Amazonian rainforest, there are ants that have symbiotic relationships with trees: the trees provide nectar, the ants who live within the trees fend off herbivores. It wouldn't be a great leap to see such a tree feeding nectar directly to the ant pupae. That's one sort of likely 'gestator': an entirely different species that benefits from a symbiotic one.\n\nThere's another more speculative kind that might be interesting for science-fiction. Conspecifics which have been bred to docility, and perhaps trained to regard birthing the IVF offspring of others as a religious virtue. If this separation of genetic contribution and gestation roles continued for long enough, one can imagine a speciation event between the elite who don't gestate, and gestators who aren't elites, wherein the elites could no longer interbreed with the gestators, and vice versa. Now, make the gestators parthenogenic, and thus more subject to pathogens, introduce a pandemic, and write about the aftermath, as the elites realize their long term breeding experiment doomed their civilization.",

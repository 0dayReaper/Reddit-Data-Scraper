It doesn't have to have a hypothesis by this definition, or discover an unknown. Being carried out under controlled conditions in order illustrate a known law is enough to fit with this common definition of experiment. You can also call it a demonstration, as she did, but that doesn't mean it is not an experiment.",

I'm going after you with the same tenacity and lack of emotion I go after anyone else in a scientific community who is wrong and insists that they aren't. Also I'll give this a hypothesis. She falsified the hypothesis that chemical law would not be applicable to that stage at the time of the experiment. The result was negative, and the hypothesis was falsified. Recreation of old experiments are still scientific experiments even if you weren't sincerely hoping the universe was broken at that point.",

In most biological experiments a null hypothesis makes a lot of sense to the point of necessity, but this isn't always the case across other fields. The actual answer to your question is \"sometimes\". It is true that when applying statistics to results you typically test against the null hypothesis of 'no change of treatment', but in the example I'm using here it's a simple transformation from the hypothesis I listed to rewriting it as a null. \"If the laws of science are invariant across space and time, then this experiment will go on without a hitch\". It's effectively the same 'boring' experiment as any other replication study, but it doesn't invalidate it as an 'experiment' which is my point here.",

There has been a massive shift in how people think from only a few hundred years ago.\n\nI can demonstrate for you how to cook the perfect egg.  I do it by watching how in changes while cooking and responding to how it behaves.  There is no set process outside of turn on the heat, drop some fat and eggs, and remove the eggs.  Are the eggs cooking too fast, so I need to lift the pan?  When the person I\u2019m teaching tries it, they\u2019re not going to know all those things.\n\nIt\u2019s that uncontrolled aspect (sorry medium heat isn\u2019t good enough and I certainly didn\u2019t time it) that makes it not an experiment.  \n\nRunning an experiment with different acids when you know the outcome anyways doesn\u2019t make it any more of an \u201cexperiment\u201d than it already was.  You just made it take more time, which wasn\u2019t an option for her.",

There is only one way to get to where she is, and that is if the golden road is bought and paved out straight to the crown since before she was born. The most frustrating thing in this women's life were all of the coaches standing over her since she was little, ensuring that she didn't break a bone, kiss a boy, eat a cookie, hit a joint, or take a sip of coffee that could turn her teeth a shade darker and blow her parent's investment. Now she batts her pretty eyelash extensions while performing a second grade science demonstration and the world falls to its knees.\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Keep hating someone who wouldn't even bother giving you the side eye.\n\n\n\nYes, now she is so entitled that she doesn't even see the people around her.

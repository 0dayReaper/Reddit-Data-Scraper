It\u2019s like a nice metaphor that the darkest coldest time of year can by warmed by friends and family. It\u2019s sad when it doesn\u2019t snow around Christmas time \n\nI guess there aren\u2019t a lot of dark snowy nights in Australian population centers so it probably wouldn\u2019t make a huge difference. I\u2019m wondering what Christmas is like in the many parts of the world that don\u2019t see inclement winter weather",

Down there every day is *basically* 12hrs of sunlight and 12hrs of night, so decorations and traditions play a major role in creating the holiday spirit. Smells and sounds are extremely good at triggering memories, so if it smells and sounds like Christmas it starts to feel like it.\n\nIt's a little surreal at first, but it's amazing to suck back some mimosas on the beach after opening presents on Christmas day, and you get used to it.",

The houses and buildings would have blinker lights on at night, and it was beautiful seeing the world in bright colors at night time. And it was hot as h*** so it was normal to just stay in the air conditioner a few times a day, or in front of the fan the entire day.\n\nNowadays we kinda lost the \"spirit\". It has gotten hard to see the lights. back then it was normal to be 80 out of 100 houses with it now it's like 15 out of 100. No one puts the decorations outside anymore, just sometimes the lights.\n\nI think we always had this idea that it was bs (it's a \"stolen\" culture after all. Just look at all the snow themed decorations and the fact that in Brazil it never snows, and you'll notice it pretty clearly), but we liked the feeling of proximity and the \"magic atmosphere\" it brings. We went through some tough moments so we don't have the same \"light\" in us, we don't have the energy anymore, it's really saddening...\n\n\nMaybe the downgrade was also because of low sales on the Christmas decorations and hard times with the economics, people stopped to have money to buy it, people got discouraged, because, \"well... No one is decorating their houses why would I\" and with time the culture was getting apart.",

The food is lighter (there are roast meats but chilled seafood and salads are a big feature) most people sit outside al fresco and meals take many hours. Kids play under sprinklers and adults drink cold wine or beer. Sometimes there are communal games, but if it's reallllly hot people just graze and slowly get pissed.",

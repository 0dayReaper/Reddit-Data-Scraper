    "postText": "Urgently need some western blot help! These questions are so basic and stupid, but I don't have experience in the area and i am currently unable to ask people in my lab for help so though reddit might be a good place to ask. Honestly would be willing to pay for the answers to some of my questions.\n\nI'm testing compounds for increased insulin sensitivity and ACE inhibition. Using HepG2s for the insulin sensitivity.\n\nQuestion 1: Antibodies \n\n\\- I'm testing for IR and phosphorylated IR. Which do I do first? (i believe the term is primary antibody and secondary antibody lol)\n\n\\- I'm also testing for gapdh as a control. At what point do I do this? \n\n\\- For ACE inhibition, should I be testing for ACE1 and ACE2? and in which order would I do these?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestion 2: Cells\n\n\\- I'm using HepG2s to test for insulin sensitivity which have a nTPM of 20.7 for IR, but 0.0 for ACE.\n\n\\- How high should the nTPM be for me to use a cell line to test for ACE inhibition?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can manage the cell culture and insulin stimulations with different compounds. I can do protein extractions to get samples.\n\nI vaguely know how to do a BCA and use a plate reader, but I dont know what do to with the BCA results and how to use them to work out how much buffer to add to the protein samples.\n\nIf anyone is able to help in any way I would be so grateful, really struggling with the biology aspect of my project rn and close to a mental breakdown/dropping out of uni x",

            "comment": "Please don't take this too negatively, but some of your questions tell me that you need more help than Reddit can provide.  I think someone needs to sit down with you and plan out a protocol.\n\nI'm guessing you're an undergrad?  Don't worry, undergrads are not expected to have mastery of experimental techniques.\n\nTo help out where I can, you're thinking of primary and secondary antibodies the wrong way.  A primary antibody binds directly to your analyte - an insulin receptor here.  A secondary antibody binds to the primary antibody and has something detectable so you can measure the amount of primary antibody and by extension, the amount of analyte.\n\nYou'd measure IR and phosphorylated IR separately, as two different analytes - even though all phosphorylated IR would also be detected as IR.  This gives you a ratio between phosphorylated and total IR.  You would measure NADPH separately and at the same time, because the amount of it should be constant even if the amount of IR changes.  It's a way to help you compare your samples against each other.  So for each sample, you should have at least three lanes.\n\nThe BCA tells you what protein concentration you have, and your protocol should tell you what concentration you need.  So you would add buffer to get that concentration for each sample.",

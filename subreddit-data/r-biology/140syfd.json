    "postText": "I don't know whether this is the right place to ask, but here goes nothing.\n\nIn mythology there are many examples of \"Living Plants\" and I was wondering whether such a thing would even be possible i.e. a plant which moves like an animal.\n\nUpon reading up on the topic I found that 1% of the plant kingdom is made up for \"Parasitic plants\" which feed on other plants and, in some cases, do not use photosynthesis.\n\nAt the risk of dipping into science fiction, what could such a plant look like in the environments present on earth, considering the fact that there are carnivorous plants and \"Parasitic/cannibalistic\" herbivorous plants, would it be able to fill a niche like those of other terrestrial species?\n\nWould a traditionally \"Parasitic\" plant such as the cordyceps fungus be able to evolve beyond simple instincts such as \"Go up\" and \"Bite down\"?\n\nI'm sorry if my rambling question doesn't belong here, and I appreciate any insight or examples you might be able to provide.",

The parasitic plants we have all feed off of other plants, growing roots into normal plants to live off their sugars.\n\nIn a hypothetical distant future or alternate reality it\u2019s possible for such a thing to evolve but nothing remotely like that exists on earth.",

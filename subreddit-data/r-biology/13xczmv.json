    "postText": "Hey, for my exam Biology and Sickness I was learning about Blood. There\u2019s a little about Hematocrit. At the end it says shifts in hematocrit are normal and temporary. Exp: If u go to the mountains and stay for atleast a few weeks, your hematocrit rises to compensate with the lower lvl\u2019s of oxygen in the air u breath in. And once you\u2019re back at your usual altitude, your hematocrit returns to normal. Now my question: Does this indicate that people who live at higher altitudes have higher hematocrit than people at \u2018lower altitudes\u2019 ? Because it seems logical they do but it isn\u2019t mentioned in my book.",

High hematocrit causes excessive red blood cells and that can lead to rising of the blood volume and blood viscosity, which can increase the risk of blood clots. Also it may signal Polycythemia. And it the patient also smokes tobacco, it would be very dangerous indeed.",

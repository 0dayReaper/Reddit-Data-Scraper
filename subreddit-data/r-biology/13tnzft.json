    "postText": "I recently purified a protein with FPLC and I saw that one of the buffers, if not both, had mold growing within the buffer. For my relevant fractions of interest, I spiked in NaN3 such that the final concentration is 0.02%. hopefully this will prevent the fungal growth from the buffers from chewing up my protein. But if I were to take the protein fractions and run them through a sizing column, would the azide in there mess with the structural integrity of the machine lines themselves? \n\nThanks in advance",

    "postText": "The question is, what is that growing on the leaves?\n\nThe larger mystery I\u2019m trying to solve is this: \nWhy is there always a swarm of flies in a specific spot in my neighborhood?? \nThere\u2019s this one spot in my neighborhood that always has flies buzzing around. Just that one specific spot, under a big tree that is next to the road, specifically on the sidewalk-side of the tree, flies appear year after year, from spring to fall. \nThe size of this spot with flies is about 5 watermelons in diameter. \nThe cleanliness of the area is consistent with the rest of the street. No visible garbage or smells.\n\nToday I noticed these things growing on the leaves in that spot, what are these and are they connected to the flies?",

What are they and how can I get rid of them or at least reduce them? Cleaning every nook and cranny when we arrive is a headache.",

I don\u2019t condone killing them so if you live in a damp environment maybe invest in a dehumidifier or a non toxic bug deterrent like tea tree or peppermint oil. They don\u2019t like those. I\u2019d recommend peppermint oil. Tea tree oil stinks lol",

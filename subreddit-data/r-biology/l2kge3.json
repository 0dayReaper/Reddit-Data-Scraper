Agar can be obtained at almost any Asian grocery stores - either in powder or non-powder form (Looks like strands, english isn't my native language either, so idk what the non-powder form is called).\n\n2. Bovine blood AKA blood from cows, calves, ox etc. You can try ask from your butcher or wet markets.\n\n3. Bacterial colony - so you can get this anywhere. Inside your mouth, on your skin, tap water, rain water, the soil etc. Simply use a cotton bud and swipe those areas mentioned, then swipe onto the blood agar.\n\nTo prepare the agar: usually just follow the instruction on the agar packaging. But, in general, add agar to water, heat, and then add the blood. Stir to mix. Pour into a mold and let it cool. It'll harden.\n\nPlease note that these are for casual diy experiments. They're not the same as what's used in the lab.",

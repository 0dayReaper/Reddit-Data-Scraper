    "postText": "I'm a high school biology student and our class is covering evolution right now and it left me confused.\n\nMy teacher teaches that evolution comes from gene mutations that were passed down to offspring and so forth, which I understand. But he says that every mutation is not influenced by the environment (let's say the extreme cold) which I don't understand.\n\nLet's take the wooly mammoth for example. He says that one day an ancestor of all wooly mammoths was randomly born with fur and that's how they developed fur to survive the cold. Completely random by chance.\n\nI would have thought that when they (the ancestor of wolly mammoths) were exposed to the extreme cold that their hair which was being exposed the most started to grow more and grow thicker (via mutations over time) thus making their fur coat over time (hundreds of generations) and thus making the wooly mammoth. Not random, gave the specie what they needed.\n\nCan someone explain to me how this works?",

            "comment": "It's that the mutations are totally random, but the ones that are most beneficial (aka the ones that may facilitate adaptions of thicker fur or whatever) will be the ones that are spread throughout the population more rapidly. This happens because those random mutations provide a benefit that gives a fitness advantage to the individual with that mutation, and they produce more offspring with that same mutation, who also have the advantage, so they produce more offspring etc. Eventually the mutation is common.",

The environment doesn't cause the mutation, but even a little fur will benefit the individual over those individuals without fur, increasing the likelihood they will have more offspring with fur. And they will then survive better and have a better likelihood of mating with other individuals who *also* survived because they have some fur and maybe some have a little more fur than others, which then gives their offspring an even bigger advantage. Eventually, those best suited to their environment will be mating with others best suited and those less suited will die off. It's a slow process of condensing traits in one direction or another, which of course then ultimately leads to speciation, since there's more than one way to survive well in any given situation.",

The environment doesn\u2019t bring out the mutation, or alter gene expression in offspring to pass on the trait. \n\nTake your mammoth example. If temperature decreases over generations, it\u2019s not the mammoth cells saying \u201clet\u2019s make more fur because it\u2019s colder\u201d that causes evolution. Rather, a mammoth will eventually be born with extra genes expressing \u201cfur\u201d in the right cells, and this organism will likely survive better and be able to procreate, thus passing down the gene.",

It has a slight advantage in a colder environment so can pass down its genes (including this mutation) more effectively than others. So the next generation had more slightly furrier mammoths and so on. Any that are born with even more fur pass this on and so on. Obviously this is super simplified.",

An important fact here is that there's always variation within a population. Some individuals may have a little less fur, some a little more, and it might not affect them significantly. But one born without fur is more likely to die young, and one born with more fur is more likely to survive more and leave more offspring.",

But it will soon die from overheating, and will not have any offspring. Thus, the \"wooly\" gene will die out and it will not be able to establish itself in an elephant population in Africa. The wooly gene can emerge again, randomly, but each time it will be a disadvantageous mutation and will lead to fitness reduction and death of the carrier elephant without being transmitted to offspring. \n\nIn Europe, if a wooly elephant is born, it will have an advantage compared to other non-mutated, non-wooly elephants. Thus it will have more offspring and the \"wooly\" gene will spread rapidly throughout the population  in several generations. In this case, the same (or similar) mutation actually is beneficial, which is dependent on the environment. \n\nTherefore, the environment does not \"cause\" or \"influence\" which mutations will appear, but it can be a factor which mutations in a certain environment are beneficial or not. Evolution is not teleological i.e. \"organisms do not evolve to be better adapted to the certain environmental factor\" but rather \"environment influences which mutations are eliminated from a population and which are preserved\". This happens gradually, over many generations.",

But they might as well be random for the sake of the discussion. \n\nIt goes more like this. Thousands of mammoths are born, one is born with a minor mutation that causes its hair to be a bit more prominent. That mammoth is a little more hearty in the cold and survives in conditions that killed many mammoths. The mammoth breeds and some of its children carry that mutation. Lo and behold, the decendents of this mammoth are more likely to have a little hair and therefore they survive a little better, retain more heat, get stronger, have more kids. Eventually this trend results in a fuzzy population that\u2019s a little more successful than the NOT fuzzy population. Then one of the fuzzy mammoth\u2019s are born with another mutation, it\u2019s hair is longer than the others. This trend of many mutations happens over a few hundred thousand years or so, and eventually your mammoths have lots of fur. \n\nTLDR: The mutation comes first, one mutation of many, but this one happens to be beneficial, so it\u2019s kids are more successful. These mutations also happen in very small increments over very long periods of time.",

            "comment": "In the case of the woolly mammoth, the extremely cold environment indeed played a crucial role in the development of their dense fur. Over time, genetic mutations could have introduced variations in the mammoth population, some of which led to thicker hair growth. In colder regions, individuals with thicker hair would have had an increased chance of surviving and reproducing, passing on their advantageous traits to subsequent generations.  \nThe gradual accumulation of these beneficial mutations, driven by the selective pressure imposed by the cold environment, eventually resulted in the woolly mammoth's well-adapted fur coat. While the specific mutations themselves may occur randomly, the selective advantage provided by the environment influenced the frequency and distribution of those mutations in the population over time.",

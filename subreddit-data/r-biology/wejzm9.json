            "comment": "*NEW*\n\nUpdate 3 (Day 2 Night):\n\nI gave it to the authorities. This is what happend. Before trying to call them again I sent an email to that guy I mentioned before. He answered me saying it does look a lot like a Human Humerus and thanked me for reaching out. He said that the bone looked recent, and bones from most recent years are considered a forensic case and not an archeological one. So he said that I should try to contact Policia Judici\u00e1ria again. So that's what I did (and no I did not call 112 like they said before, they don't seem to know what to do in these cases or even how to properly proceed with it). When I called they said it probably wasn't human because that would be weird and because it was found in a weird spot, they asked some questions and said it was probably nothing to worry a lot about (and I could take some time to actually do anything). Still he told me I could give it to them in Faro's Pol\u00edcia Judici\u00e1ria Department (Wich is wierd because when I called yesterday they told me to do something completely different). So there I went with my bone. When I got there and they saw the bone they were like \"ok it is probably human\" (not those words exactly, but it's like they expressed it). So they asked me a bunch of questions (like the exact coordinates I found it, my phone number, my sister's phone number - since she was the one who actually saw it inside water - and they asked me to describe exactly what happened. To be completely honest it didn't seem very professional (there was a lot of noise and I could barely concentrate, they were like speeding it a little bit so I might not have given every detail they should get, and there was not a type of report that even matched what I wanted to report - supposedly I reported for a possible crime. They wrote it down, made me read it all the way through and said I didn't need to sign or anything like that. Authorities also said there are no missing people in that area. Now they will send it for inspection and verify if it's human or not (if not, the case is just archived), in case it is there are 2 outcomes. 1st one it's if it matches a DNA from someone (they'll probably investigate it more I think) and 2nd one is if it doesn't match any DNA (in that case they'll keep the bone in case something new appears). I guess this is basically it....\nThey don't know if I'll ever get feedback and, even if I do, it might take a long time (in case it does I may update here or do a new post). We might never know anything, and I guess that's life.\n\nThanks everyone who helped, everyone who shared and enjoyed the post, and again everyone who gave me awards &lt;3\n\nI really wish we still got some closure.\n\nAnyways I hope the owner of the bone rests in peace :)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate 2 (Day 2 Morning):\n\nHello everyone, I just woke up (I barely slept tbh) but I'll try to share my thoughts and things I think might be relevant.\n\nFirst of fall I wrapped the bone with some paper towel as some people said for me to do it and I'm trying not to touch it.\n\nTurning the bone to authorities might not give us an answer to this case ever, but it's probably the only solution I have. I only got until day 6 to do something (since I'm from another location in Portugal). I don't know if they are able to keep us updated but I'll try to ask for that. Maybe the news will, in case anyone notices it went on the news tell me please. I personally won't report it to news channels because it might be from some member of a family (and maybe the family doesn't want it to appear on the news).\n\nQuick reminder that I know where the bone was found, it's easy to remember since I always stay in the same place in that beach since I was a kid. Anyways it was \"swimming\" on water for a long time probably, so location might not be that important.\n\nI also don't feel like spending my personal money to have someone tell us about the bone hahaha. And I don't know if I can just give it to a university, maybe I have to talk to the police first (I'll try to ask that, but I doubt they say anything useful).\n\nAnd thanks to everyone helping, everyone interested and thanks to the ones giving awards :)\n\nI'll probably call them later and after that I'll try to keep you updated :)\n\n(btw: I'm trying to keep me out of trouble or my parents since I'm only 17, I really don't want the authorities mad at me lmao).\n\nOh and I just received a message from an archeologist saying they know someone that could help (he is a biological anthropologist and works at \"Universidade do Algarve\"). \nI'll try to contact them first it may be helpful :)\n\n------------------------\n\nUpdate 1:\n\nSo far this is what we know (or think we know):\nThis is probably a Human Humerus. It's almost the same size as mine (I'm a 17 year old male - 176cm) and it's also broken. The edges are not sharp so it's probably been on water for a long time. Day 1 I tried to contact authorities but they said to contact other people and didn't even know exactly what to say. Police in Portugal rarely do any shit so I think they might not find anything out. Still I'll try to contact them again Day 2 (tomorrow) - (yes that means I went home with the bone). I'll try not to touch it and keep it safe. I want to have some closure :)\nAlso a lot of people sometimes go missing on beaches because of the strong waves.\n(I still don't know if it is broken or cut, but it's probably broken). I didn't find any specific news that could help. \n\nSmall edit: I already contacted Pol\u00edcia Judici\u00e1ria, they were the ones I called yesterday (day 1).\n\nLocation: Praia Da Manta Rota, Algarve, Portugal\n\nDay Found: August 2nd \n\n(BTW is there any way I can update directly on the post? Or pin this comment?) - (I'll probably use this comment as a update I still don't know). I'm on mobile so it's kinda confusing.\n\nAnd thanks to everyone helping :)",

They did nothing. Then wrote an email to the major (it was a small town), received no answer. Then I sent a written official letter to the authority....and magically lazy asses did their job and the issue was fixed!\n\nYou have a dead person bone. It seems way more important than loud music.

It is assumed that he committed suicide and his body also ended up at the bottom of the sea. Only the body of one of the daughters (a baby) was found. I only mention it because I wonder if it could be his remains (since you are in Portugal), in any case the police should investigate that bone.",

    "postText": "I saw the beginnings of what looked like a wasp nest. Just one little tube. Saw a wasp go in it and when it left I busted the thing open and a bunch of colourful creepycrawlies fell out. Definitely 1 wasp larva. Larva was alive. 1 Colourful creepycrawly wriggled then went still.. but they have all since.. disappeared so I think they were alive. Just confused as to what was happening here- why were there colourful creatures in this active nest?",

They carry the mud to a protected nest site, where they construct a cell. Then they begin hunting for spiders to provision the cell for their young, and lay a single egg inside. When they capture a spider, they sting it, permanently paralyzing it. This preserves the spider until their larvae are ready to eat it. When the cell is full of spiders, the female mud dauber caps it with more mud and builds another cell next to it. After the egg hatches and the food gone, she pupates. When an adult emerges, it opens the cap, leaving holes behind in the nest for the next cycle.",

Sounds a lot more likely that they were paralysed.. and I DID see the wasp return angrily a few times so maybe she was taking the food to another nest?",

Its a snapshot into what Earth microbial life was capable of in that geological abyss below the the Cambrian explosion.\n\nIt's not a threat to humanity. Its not an independent origin of life (something I don't expect to ever be discovered in the solar system). But it is a window into the deep past.",

Any life discovered there is likely contamination from recent exploration. \n\nBut for places like Shakelton crater on the Moon, or any place on Europa, there will be extreme efforts at both probe sterilization, and sequencing cleaning implements used during spacecraft assembly. \n\nThat's the main reason we sent probes like Galileo or Cassini into the gas giants, to avoid potential contamination of the moons.",

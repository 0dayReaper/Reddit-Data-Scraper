I haven't had too much experience in the field yet, but I can safely assume that there will be none whatsoever. When I started learning in STEM, I was surprised by the number of trans individuals who were working towards the same degree as me. My college is in a rural area and is not so accepting, but on campus, it's a whole other world that accommodates and accepts everyone. I so guess long story short, don't worry. I hope this makes you feel a little better about the future!",

I have seen everyone at my workplace from different ethnicities and English language learners, and many LGBTQ+, we are very accepting and have no tolerance for harassment. I assume this is standard but things that may make a difference:  \n- I work in Canada  \n- we are a large business with a unionized position",

The scab *is* the plaster and should dry to properly seal; covering creates a moist pitri-dish area and slows the scab hardens (which takes no time at all in fresh air). \n\nIf im still working I use them if its a bit deep, to stop dirt getting ground into an open would and not get blood on everything. Then i get rid of that plaster as soon as I can. Clean, usually sqeeze to get some more blood to form a scab... Let it dry in open air. I heal quick. \n\nDoes it really heal faster with a plaster? That seems counter to all my experience. I can see that keeping the skin moist (softer) might reduce scaring.",

Blood clotting (quickly patching up the hole) is limited by the amount of platelets that come by and stick to the hole, and then the speed of signalling chemicals to cause fibrin formation. 2. Inflammation (your white blood cells cleaning up the mess) is limited by the speed at which signalling molecules warn the white blood cells, and then how quickly the white blood cells can arrive at the wound and clean things up. 3. Proliferation (making new tissue) is mainly limited by processes of cell division and growth catalyzed by enzymes. Why can't you speed this up? Enzymatic reactions are chemical reactions that require energy in the form of ATP,  which is only limitedly available in each cell. This can be generated through metabolism (breaking down food or stored energy), but this also takes time. Another way to increase enzymatic activity is to increase temperature, like during a fever, but a too high temperature is damaging to other proteins in your cells. 4. Maturation (putting everything back the way it was). Here all the hastily constructed cells that are not correctlt placed will be broken down (again, enzymes)",

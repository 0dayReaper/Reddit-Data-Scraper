    "postText": "Octopuses are remarkable in their ability to use many arms together during behavior.\n\nArm responses and multi-arm coordination can occur without engagement of major brain regions, which indicates the importance of local proprioceptive responses and peripheral connections. Here, we examine the intramuscular nerve cords (INCs), are the key proprioceptive anatomy in the arms. INCs are understood to include proprioceptive neurons, multipolar neurons, and motoneurons and are thought to contribute to structuring whole-arm movement. 1",

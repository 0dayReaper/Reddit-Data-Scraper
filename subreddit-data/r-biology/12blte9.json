If you're walking through a closed forest canopy and see large thick lower branches on some trees it means that forest has only recently regenerated and reclosed the canopy.\n\nConversely if a forest is selectively cut, some trees yhat are left will sprout new branches along their length to catch the newly available sunlight.",

The new growth is at the very base of the leaf, and the farther up the leaf, the older the tissue.  It gets raised up into the sky as the plant grows.  This is how you can keep mowing grass and it doesn't die.",

But young pines start off having green growing branches down near ground-level. They're just aggressive about self-pruning off older and shaded branches over time, once those branches aren't productive enough for the tree to continue investing resources into those branches to keep the limbs alive.",

Where I'm at in North America deer are our most abundant large herbivore, and during hard winters their major food source is twigs, bark, and buds (along with living off their summer fat stores). \n\nIn areas with a very abundant deer population you can often see an obvious \"graze line\" where branches and other deer-edible vegetation have been chewed off as far up as deer can reach. But even in less densly-populated areas large herbivores still exert a notable influence on how far up a tree before you'll usually start seeing lots of older branches (those that were out of browsing reach and thus managed to survive multiple winters so they could keep getting bigger).",

Trees allow for water in the air to condensate onto them. And they catch rain. This water flows down to the roots. So in a way, the water also comes from the air, and it is released into the air as well.\n\nDo downvote, but I can't unsee trees growing into the ground, once I realized that the majority of weight of the wood comes from CO2.",

Those buds you see on the branches in the spring, that's where the growth occurs. There's also some outward growth as the tissue on the main trunk puts on another layer.\n\nSome plants, like grass, grow from the bottom. The new growth is at the very base of the leaf, and the farther up the leaf, the older the tissue. It gets raised up into the sky as the plant grows. This is how you can keep mowing grass and it doesn't die.\n\nSo grass growing from the bottom is actually an outlier and most plants grow from their tops.",

I have a pineapple plant - it just keeps making new leaves from the center. I have a pepper plant - new growth from the top and the old leaves at the bottom stay there. Jade plant? Old leaves stay, new growth on top.\n\nThe only plant I have that I can think of matching the red is a calathea, or something I assume is one, which creates rolled up leaves in a sort of spike and then that spike gets further and further up and away from the bottom until it finally unfurls.\n\nSo maybe it just depends?",

The trunk of a tree is basically a long, narrow cone covered in a living skin; as that skin grows inwards, it stretches, and the cone grows taller and wider. The cambium generally grows faster toward the tip, so it elongates more than it thickens.\n\nIt's not all that different from dipping taper candles, really. They elongate and thicken in pretty much the same pattern with each dip, just as trees grow a new layer each year.",

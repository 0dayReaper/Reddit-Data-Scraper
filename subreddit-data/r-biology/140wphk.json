It causes a pseudo-allergic contact form of urticaria (aka hives; a topical rash). This is where the family gets it\u2019s name; *Urticaceae*. \n\nWhen you touch it, histamine (and other chemicals) get into your skin and cause an immune reaction. \n\nA supplement of stingling nettle would be processed so that skin exposure to the \u201cstinging\u201d part of the nettle is eliminated.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I\u2019m currently working on a paper and came across the word \u201epan-(YAP-)antibody\u201c which was used to observe higher nuclear (active) levels of a protein. The active version is dephosphorylated and the inactive version is phosphorylated. Does this indicate that the antibody binds only to the active and dephosphorylated protein? How exactly does this type of antibody work? \nThank you in advance",

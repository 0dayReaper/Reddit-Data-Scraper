    "postText": "I recently read calculus reordered and Real Analysis: A radical approach by David Bressoud and I really loved the idea of presenting the ideas of a subject as they developed through history, presenting the historical background of each part of the theory.\n\nI am curious if there are any other books which are like that (books that present their material chronologically and try to explain the rationale behind each advancement in the theory, not bio history books)\n\nI am also a bit of newbie in bio so i would really appreciate something beginner friendly\nI would also appreciate it if you could suggest a book in adjacent fields (chemistry, etc)",

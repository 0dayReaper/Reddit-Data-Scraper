Fungi of the species Coccidioides naturally lives in the soil, and when this soil is disturbed, humans tend to breathe in the anthrocondida and become infected with valley fever. Most people have nothing to worry about since 60% of cases are asymptomatic, but those with compromised immune systems are at high risk. And interestingly enough, people of Filipino and African origin are at much higher risk than the rest of the population. Like I said, Valley Fever is most prominent in Southern AZ, but there have been many cases from southern California, Texas, New Mexico, Oregon, and Washington.",

You can also freeze them and store them for an extended period of time. You can see them move moments after being thawed.

            "comment": "Likely just beacuse it's a simple mutation that humans like the look of, so historically people probably took a bit more interest and care of white-footed kittens. Especially way back when this color mutation first occurred. \n\nhttps://www.livescience.com/why-cats-have-white-socks-on-paws.html\n\nThis \"white socks\" mutation still exists in domestic cats because they don't need great camouflage like wild cats - having bright white make it a little harder to sneak up on prey or avoid predators, but since humans will feed and protect them at least a bit that makes white coloring not such a disadvantage for domesticated animals. You can see this effect in many different domesticated species, where the wild ancestors don't have flashy colors but now we have many breeds that do - dogs, cat, cattle, horses, chickens, geese, pigs, etc.\n\nTldr; humans like flashy coloring on their animals. Especially when it makes our animals look different from their wild relatives. So when mutations for bright white and other fancy flashy colorings show up in our animals we encourage it.",

It's plausible that genes for neoteny, tameability / tolerance of human contact are genetically linked to those for coat pattern in *Carnivora* (canines and felines shared a common ancestor \\~52 million years ago).",

Here is a great movie on the whole concept of dog domestication and it effects biologically.\n\nhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3103_dogs.html",

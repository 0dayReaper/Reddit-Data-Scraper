Or are people on cross sex hormones considered to be the same sex than the one they were assigned at birth? Is an intersex person with parts from both sexes considered to be both male and female? Alternatively, is someone who got part of their reproductive system removed medically partially fe/male? Are many compounds there is to biological sex?",

It\u2019s the social component. \n\nIn the old days we talked about \u201csex change surgery\u201d as if performing a vaginoplasty would change someone\u2019s biology. It was a little confusing because it did and didn\u2019t.\n\nThese days we are more likely to talk about \u201cgender affirmation surgery\u201d which describes interventions that support an individual presenting socially in the way that matches how they experience themselves internally. It skips the question of sex because it\u2019s not especially relevant.",

The development of the male sex is triggered by the SRY gene.\n\nIndividual cells can be receptive to hormones, but taking them does not change your sex. You remain your birth sex.\n\nAn intersex person (an outdated term, Differences of Sexual Development is preferred) may have structures that look superficially similar to the other sex, or both, but only one or none will be functional. There are no humans which produce viable gametes of both types.\n\nSomeone who has had functional parts removed, or don't function correctly, are still the same birth sex as their body developed along one or the other pathway.",

And as a general rule that is the case the presence of at least one Y chromosome will result in a biological male (XXY and XYY will both develop as biological male, with some degree of reduces fertility XXY, and yes you can get more Xs and Ys into that mix, the more sex chromosoms the greater the impact on the phenotype but they are still typically viable).\n\nHowever there are people (and presumably animals too) who are biologically the opposite to their chromosomal sex. If someone is XY but a region of the Y chromosome called the SRY (sex-determining region of Y-chromosome) is non-functional then the first switch of the developmental pathway that switches the embryo development from the default of female to the the alternate of male is never flipped and the embryo develops as a female (usually not detected until an absense of the menstual cycle at puberty). \n\nSimilarly, someone who has XX chromosome can develop male if that SRY section if the Y chromosome breaks off and gets attached to another chromosome such as one of the Xs. This can result in ambiguous genitalia but not always. It does result in infertility.\n\nTL:DR Humans like to put things in nice neat boxes with clear labels,  life likes to laugh at those boxes",

So someone who is MTF (I think this is the right term), even if she has had significant surgery would still have a risk of prostate cancer which someone born female would not. So although most of her physiology might present as female, she would maintain some male biological traits and her chromosomes would remain XY.\n\nAs I said, not my area of specialism, I deal with animals (gender isn't a thing) and plants (where sex isn't always a thing).",

(I know theses labels are about the gender you were assigned at birth but let\u2019s be honest here, when we are talking about someone who is trans you have someone with a specific anatomy in mind) like if I cannot know what my sex is I can just say than I am a different gender than my agab but I\u2019m cis because as long as there is no proof than my sex is x, then all we can do is assume it\u2019s what I think it is\n\nBut still\u2026 the fact that people are assigned a sex at birth in the first place implies than there is a defenition of sex somewhere, and that according to that definition, you can change your sex at least partially. Like medically people who take cross sex hormones are considered to be the other sex medically if I recall correctly, and I wonder if there is another way to medically change your sex than taking hormones?",

Male and Female are convenient categorizations of the 2 modes of the distribution of sex characteristics but this individual is sufficiently outside the modes.\n\nYou could categorize them as male, female, a mixture of both or anything else depending on which system of classification you come up with.",

In a lot of medical settings you could most often call someone with a penis \"male\" and it would function with reference to a specific set of relevant characteristics to their treatment if they don't deviate significantly from the binary we generally see, but it's not as useful anymore to even apply a binary term to someone significantly deviated from it. Significant is a subjective word here that depends on context and personal evaluation. Sex is only defined by a statistical cluster of biological characteristics. It should be obvious from peoples' answers at this point that modern scientists are coming to understand sex as more of a colloquial word to describe many common distributions of traits rather than a real, rigid thing with an exact meaning. You seem to have an issue with accepting that science doesn't pretend to have absolute definitions for a perfect human binary, but humans themselves don't actually display a perfect binary of characteristics, so of course they can't. Sex as a concept is an old fashioned, inherently mildly unscientific generalization. From the questions you're asking it seems like you really want to get a specific thing out of this, where's this coming from? People don't have to fit in a box.",

In order to find individuals who naturally don't fit into these categories an extremely high degree of specification must take place and their categorization can be resolved on an individual basis. It's like how a human can have no legs, or even in some rare cases up to 8, but we wouldn't define a human being as having 0-8 or more legs.\n\nIt is quite difficult to form categories in nature that are 100% concrete, even down to materials, but they prove/have proven necessary, since we can't, for example, argue against the necessity to differentiate between humans and other biological creatures. With the extremely high degree of rarity attached to the emergence of certain outliers taken into account when making categories, their existence should be taken as proof of how concrete the categories are rather than proof that they are invalid.",

The first obvious one is sterile individuals that don't produce gametes.\n\nFor humans, a distinction that I make and find useful is that a male (or female) is someone who went through the process of masculinization (or feminization). I think considering it the result of a process rather than a state/property, mainly involving hormones, is useful especially if you consider the fact that these processes can be more or less advanced. Within this framework, you can place intersex and various weird phenotypic presentations as people who had atypical masculinization or feminization. And trans people fit in this framework, especially if hormone therapy is taken before puberty (which is the last stage of mascu/feminization). In some true sense they have gone through some of the changes that a foetus of their preferred gender goes through to become a man/woman.\n\nYou can answer many of your questions through this view. How many dimensions is there to sex? However many things are affected by the differences in hormone exposure. Parts removed ? Well, what's your history of hormone levels and what changes did it make to your body ?\n\nNote that this is the purely biological component. Of course, given how social we are as animals, being (fe)male comes with differences in a ton of stuff besides hormones levels.",

And I'm going to be completely honest, one that I don't really care about.\n\nYou can break basically any definition if you look closely enough. Even in hard science fields with pretty conventional definitions like \"element\" in chemistry (which is, nitpicking about how deuterium behaves chemically somewhat differently from hydrogen), or foundational concepts like \"word\" in linguistic or \"species\" in biology. At the end of the day those are words, \"female\" doesn't exist in the real world, the only thing that exists is a vaguely coherent blob of cells moving about. \n\nI think the scientific ethos, when it comes to those never ending debates about definition is to shrug and go for [pragmatism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism). In the philosophical sense of the word, that is, how *useful* is the word to make sense of the world for us humans. When talking about humans, you can add a general \"don't be a dick\" principle on top of that, especially when the identity of people or groups of people are involved.\n\nIn many respects, most of the time, someone who grew up with working testis will have been masculinized by hormone exposure, will act socially as a male, will have health risks typical of a male, etc... In many dimensions, \"male\" will be very predictive of the person's behavior, even if they no longer have their gonads (and of course the same goes for females in reverse). There's a kind of fuzzy logic to categorization, if you check 37 out of the 50 boxes, it can make sense to put you in the category representented by these boxes.\n\nWhen it comes to transgender people, you will see them be significantly discordant from their sex in many of these dimensions (neurologically, in terms of pre-natal hormone exposure, behaviorally, etc...). Thus it can make sense to adapt the label we put on them, cause \"male\" will be less predictive of that person's behavior/psychology/etc... Like, if someone tells me they are FtM, it gives me meaningful info, I can make sense of their situation easier. \n\nThat's my two cents anyway.",

The developmental aspect is the femini/masculinization I talked about in the first comment, it's fairly well described. For both gender and sexuality, there is, IMO, strong evidence that pre-natal exposure to hormone defines gender and sexual preferences (from the \"birth order effect\" to the data on mom with thyroid problems). There are epigenetic theories but basically it loops back around to how those pre-natal hormone exposures are read.\n\nThere's considerable evidence that this essentially decided in the womb, with gender non-typical behavior starting to appear super early and generally suppressed by the parents (hence, not socialization or education).\n\nAlthough this is far from my expertise. In terms of \"definition\" like we were talking about, hormones would be super hard cause every sex has every hormone to different levels, and of course within sexes there's a ton of variation (changes as time passes as well). At best it's among these many dimensions I was talking about.",

We're in a bit of a transitory phase, where society hasn't really come to a consensus on how to talk about it.\n\nPeople can be stubborn and refuse to acknowledge other people's feelings and internal identity. Largely those people are concerned with social and cultural dominance.\n\nBut, it's very simple to say, \"this person was born with the physical attributes of a male or female. However, this person doesn't identify with the standard gender expression that are correlated with physical attributes they were born with(e.g. biological sex).\"\n\nPersonally, as a cisgendered male, I benefit from a relaxing of rigid gender norms. For quite some time US culture has been obsessed with feminizing men who have diverse interests or don't display the most aggressive male characteristics. \"You're GAY!\" was a common insult I experienced as a child, simply because I didn't have any interest in football, fighting or general chest bumping. Likewise, many of the men who ARE obsessed with those things turned out to be bi or gay and were projecting or seeking companionship, but fearful of social rejection.\n\nIf you go to the doctor, your \"assigned at birth\" gender is very important. Among your social groups or workplace, it's probably not important except for reducing discrimination for or against you. In science, depending on what you're studying, it will be a more or less important variable.",

I guess if , for example, person is born with both sex chromosomes, for humans XX/YX mutation or with both reproductive organs, then you might use secondary gender characteristics (if they look masculine or feminine) and which reproductive organ actually works, because even if it's both, then usually only one works. If you are wondering about trangenderism, there is nothing hard about it, it's neural/humoral problem.",

The membrane, in turn sends these vibrations on to the malleus, incus, and stapes. From these, the vibration continues into the cochlea and make a ripple in the fluid it contains. These vibrations are picked up by tiny hair cells - well, after that, it gets pretty complicated, but that's the general gist of it.",

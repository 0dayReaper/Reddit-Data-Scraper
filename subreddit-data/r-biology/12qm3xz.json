Why learn how to study the most efficient way when some guy has already done it for you?\n\nAlso be wary of study groups if your class grades on a hard curve. I know of plenty of students that sabotaged other students in order to get ahead at UC Davis. I remember going into our first genetics exam and happened to be talking with the other study group (I headed another one) and the other leader had pushed something incorrect and I'm pretty sure it was on purpose (we swapped notes/lecture recordings and his were correct).",

Her tests were mostly straight from the handouts, other than a few from the labs here and there. I had those things memorized. A precious student told me to know the material in her notes for the first test. After that it was all the time studying the notes. \n\nShe put out the test scores using a code system, so you could see all the scores in the class, but didn't know who had which score. I was consistently in the top 3 of the class. I know I didn't know all the material as well as many others, but I had the professor dialed in and knew how to excel in that class.\n\nI often tell students I know that they need to learn their professor as much as the material. Those who understand this thrive. Unfortunately, this is also often the case in the real world and you can be great at your job and still miss out on advancement, if you're not on the page your boss is on.",

(I know we all learn differently but maybe this will help\u2014 maybe not).  First know how to spell the word.  Than When you see one of those words not only do you read the definition but do research on the word itself.  See where the root is from.  See what language it\u2019s based on.   Look at the vowels and see where they come from.  Break down the word and you\u2019ll eventually know the rest.",

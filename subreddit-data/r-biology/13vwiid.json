    "postText": "So, my mother is battling a lung infection called MAC (Mycobacterium Avium Complex). It's a really nasty thing that's difficult to treat. This doesn't usually infect healthy people; it typically targets individuals with HIV, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiectasis (which my mother has).\nPeople with these conditions can contract MAC or pseudomonas due to water contamination, possibly exacerbated by GERD.\nI would like to be as cautious as possible, so I am considering installing a 1-micron filter plus a UVC light sanitizer in her house's water supply.\nThere is a review that states that MAC is particularly difficult to eradicate with this light, and that UVC may leave some bacteria alive. I consider this acceptable because the less exposure, the lower the risk of reinfection. But my question is, if UVC only leaves behind those bacteria resistant to it, could that potentially cause more harm than good? As you might understand, I'm not an expert on this topic, so I would like to know if the impact of leaving the resistant ones makes it harder to treat in case of a subsequent infection.\n\n\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00190/full\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2583497/",

            "comment": "By what you posted MAC is more resistant to UV than E. coli. That's not particularly surprising as MAC have an extracellular defense, a capsule, where E. coli doesn't. Some MAC can create a spore form, too.\n\nWhile I can't say it is impossible a more UV resistant Mycobacterium could arise I can say it would be very unlikely. As I'm guessing you've read the numbers of bacteria in tapwater is very low.\n\nThose precautions seems reasonable to me.",

Many, like Scallops also have approx 200 eyes that can detect changes in light/dark that give them plenty of time to just bounce before you get there. \n\nMany people think bivalves simply \u201csit there\u201d which can\u2019t be further from the truth. Many don\u2019t simply close when touched, they will actually bury themselves in the sand long before you even see them. They run from and avoid many predators including snails, sea stars and some varieties of shark as well. They\u2019re good at hiding. Ever wonder why you haven\u2019t seen one? :)\n\nIf you\u2019re referencing them doing nothing as they sit in your sink, waiting to be eaten, it\u2019s because they\u2019re significantly weakened as they\u2019re not in water and have, instead, been buried and covered in ice for days at a time and in fresh water.\n\nThey leave long before you get close enough to notice. They\u2019re quite [mobile](https://youtu.be/NBH3UvlZo90)\n\nEdit: A better [video ](https://youtu.be/kw6wGwKEdT8)\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for the award, fren!!",

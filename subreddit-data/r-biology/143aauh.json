She is the largest individual in the colony and is responsible for reproduction. The queen is the only female that breeds and gives birth to pups, ensuring the continuation of the colony. The queen also makes the other females reproductive organs stop working with ways like: \n \n  \u2022 Pheromonal inhibition: The queen's pheromones suppress reproductive development and ovulation in subordinate females.\n\n   \u2022 Social inhibition: The queen's dominant behavior discourages subordinate females from reproducing.\n\n   \u2022 Behavioral suppression: Subordinate females exhibit non-reproductive behavior, reducing sexual behavior and fertility.\n\n**Workers:** The majority of naked mole rats in a colony are non-breeding individuals known as workers. These workers are sterile and do not reproduce. They are responsible for keeping everything working and running workers perform a wide range of tasks and exhibit a division of labor based on their age, size and what the colony needs..\n\n**Caste system:** The naked mole rat colony has a hierarchical caste system, where workers are divided into groups based on what the colony needs: small workers, medium workers, and large workers.\n   \n 1. Small workers: The smallest and youngest individuals in the colony, typically around one year old. They are responsible for tasks such as digging new tunnels and chambers, gathering food, and cleaning the nest. They have smaller bodies that enable them to navigate through narrow tunnels efficiently.\n\n   \u2022 **Diggers:** Diggers are specialized in excavating and expanding the intricate tunnel systems that make up the mole rat colony.\n\n&gt; Smaller body size for maneuvering through narrow tunnels.\nStrong forelimbs and well-developed claws for effective digging.\nPotential specialized musculature and bone adaptations for digging.\n\n   \u2022 **Nurses:** Nurses care for the young and assist the queen in nurturing and protecting the newborn naked mole rats.\n\n&gt; Well-developed mammary glands for milk production.\nMaternal behaviors, such as grooming and licking newborns.\nSlightly more robust body compared to other small workers.\n\n\u2022 Medium workers: As small workers age and grow, they transition into the medium worker stage. Medium workers are responsible for expanding and maintaining the tunnel system, collecting and storing food, and participating in defense activities. They form the bulk of the worker population.\n\n   \u2022 **Foragers:** Foragers venture out of the colony to search for food and bring it back to sustain the colony.\n*Traits*\n\n&gt; Well-developed sensory organs, including acute smell and touch.\nStrong jaws and teeth for handling and manipulating food.\nModerate body size for tunnel navigation and foraging.\n\n   \u2022 **Scouts:** Scouts explore the surrounding environment, searching for potential resources, food, and suitable areas for colony expansion.\n\n&gt; Keen senses, including excellent vision and acute smell.\nAgile and flexible for navigating complex environments.\nWell-developed sense of exploration and orientation.\n\n   \u2022 Large workers: Large workers are the oldest and largest individuals in the colony. They are responsible for tasks that require more strength and endurance, such as defending the colony against intruders, enlarging the tunnel system, and moving heavy objects. Large workers also participate in foraging expeditions to gather food from outside the colony.\n\n   \u2022 **Soldiers:** Soldiers have a defensive role and protect the colony against potential threats. Soldiers are larger and stronger than other workers and engage in aggressive behaviors.\n\n&gt; Larger and stronger body structure compared to other workers.\nWell-developed mandibles and teeth for powerful bites in defense.\nPotential thicker skin and additional musculature for increased protection.\n\nEscorts: Escorts accompany and protect the reproductive queen during her forays outside the colony.\n\n&gt; Larger body size for physical protection of the reproductive queen.\nDefensive behaviors, including aggression and intimidation.\nStronger muscles and enhanced physical capabilities for protection.\n\n____________________________________\n**1/2 Cooperative care:**\n\n**Queen:**\n The queen, as the sole reproductive female in the colony, plays a central role in cooperative care. She gives birth to the pups and provides them with milk for nourishment. The queen is responsible for nursing and protecting the young, ensuring their well-being during their early stages of development.\n\n**Workers:**\n  \n   \u2022 Babysitting: Workers take turns babysitting the young by staying near the nursery chamber where the queen's pups are housed. This helps to ensure constant surveillance, thermoregulation, and protection for the vulnerable offspring.\n\n   \u2022 Nursing and grooming: Workers may also assist the queen in nursing the pups by providing additional milk. They engage in alloparental care, which involves caring for the offspring of others. Workers may groom and clean the pups, promoting hygiene and social bonding within the colony.\n\n   \u2022 Training and socialization: As the pups grow older, workers play a role in their socialization and integration into the colony. They teach the young about the complex social structure, behaviors, and tasks necessary for survival. This ensures that the new generations of workers are well-prepared to contribute to the colony's activities.\n\n**Soldiers:** \nThey help protect the nursery chambers and the young from potential threats, such as predators or intruders from other colonies. Soldiers are vigilant in defending the queen and the pups, contributing to their overall safety.",

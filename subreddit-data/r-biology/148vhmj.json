Might be an ant alate, as you suggest, so a male or queen, based on the chunky thorax and style of running.\n\nI'd guess it flies toward the white tiles because they're bright. They're really bad flyers compared to other insects, which would explain it's unusual seeming behavior.",

Queens lose their wings and land, looking for a place to nest. My guess is she already bred, and went indoors thinking she found a spot, now she\u2019s changed her mind and seems to be having a little trouble getting back off the ground, lol.",

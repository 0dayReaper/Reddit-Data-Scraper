I think the biggest I caught, the body was almost the size of my palm maybe 3 1/2 to 4 inches. That one hurt me. His claws were big. \nWait til the sun goes down and hunt for them with a flashlight. 2 people works best, get between them and their hole and the other person chases it around. They sometimes retreat to the water but usually just run around the beach. Ridiculously fast little creatures. I absolutely love ghost crabs, something about their pointy eyes I dunno.",

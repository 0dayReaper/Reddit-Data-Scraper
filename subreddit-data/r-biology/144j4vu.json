    "postText": "So I finished ap bio with a lab where we had to make a system that separates two environments. We had gone outside to get ants before doing the lab just to test it. I came up with the idea to use aluminum foil (google said ants cant climb up it) to make it so ants can't get from one environment to the other. Anyway we got completely side tracked and noticed something weird with the behavior of the ants. We had a sheet of aluminium foil and tested to see if the ant could climb up it. I thought beforehand we would have to put food on top to motivate the ants but no he went up by himself. It was obvious he couldn't climb it yet he still tried. We even put food behind him to motivate the and however he still was trying to go up. Does anyone have an explanation for the ant behavior?\n\nI thought that because we isolated a single ant he wad trying to simulate climbing an ant nest but neither me nor my teacher had any clue what was going on.",

            "comment": "I have no idea. But one possibility is that is was simply statistical. Most ants can't. Or, they vary. An occasional one can.\n\nOne could test this.\n\n\nIt is possible that the one that could is a mutant. In principle, breed it, and get a new ant strain with Al-climb ability.",

                    "comment": "I don\u2019t think the question anymore is whether ants *can* climb Al, but rather why they (or the one they singled out) desired to climb said Al; regardless of the position of food.\n\nI think it has to do with the region in the environment this test was carried out. Since it was not in the lab space, the Al sheet might have genuinely been in the way the ant was previously trying to head toward. Hence, despite the short term promise of food behind it, it didn\u2019t lose sight of its previous goal and continued trying to climb the Al.",

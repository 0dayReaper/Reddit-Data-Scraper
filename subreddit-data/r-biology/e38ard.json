After a while, the birds will start to know the difference between fake and real spiders (through nature selecting for the birds who can tell the difference). This in turn will put a selective pressure on the snake to evolve a even more realistic-looking tail. Which in turn then forces birds to evolve even more keen senses to pick up minute differences. It keeps going like that like dominoes. This probably can also explain why the tail looks so damn real. After centuries of evolution, it\u2019s bound to be pretty real-looking. Very cool!",

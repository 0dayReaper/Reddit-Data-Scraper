    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI want to design primers for qPCR for cDNA for a specific protein. I am stuck...\n\nI cannot find the cDNA sequence for the protein, I can only find the mRNA sequence. The DNA sequence seems to be for the entire chromosome and not just the protein.... I have the DNA sequence of the protein from back-translating using ESEMBLE tool. \n\nThere is a tool on IDT called 'Primerquest' tool in which you can paste a sequence, and then the program will suggest suitable primers for qPCR. My problem is that I do not have the cDNA sequence... is the cDNA sequence simply the reverse complement of the mRNA sequence?\n\nAny help is appreciated... I spent many hours on this now. :/\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

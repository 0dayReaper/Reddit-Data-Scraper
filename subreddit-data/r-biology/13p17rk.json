    "postText": "As with my other question, I\u2019m asking this in 100% good faith. I know that questions about evolution from laypeople (especially those on the internet) can often be weird creationist Trojan horses; that\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing here. \n\nOk so we often hear that evolution does not produce \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201cmore highly evolved\u201d species. I get that; a human and a harpy eagle are both extremely well-adapted for their respective niches. \n\nBut if we compare species from today - say that same harpy eagle - with species from eons ago - say tiktaalik - can we not say that the harpy eagle IS more evolved than the tiktaalik? My thinking is that there has been significantly more evolutionary adaptation to result in the eagle, which may actually be a superset of the adaptation needed to yield the tiktaalik. \n\nThe question is more of a semantic on than a valuation one. Clearly both harpy eagles and tiktaalik were/are successful.",

But in a strict semantic sense doesn\u2019t \u201cmore evolution\u201d mean\u2026\u201dmore evolved \u201c? Yes you\u2019re right that doesn\u2019t make a claim about success. Cheetahs are super well adapted for their niche, but it\u2019s a pretty bad niche. But yet can\u2019t we call cheetahs \u201cmore evolved\u201d than a more basal feline that would actually be more successful?",

Some minor changes that aren't even noticable require multiple thousands of mutations while some big changes require only a couple of hundred. Apart from that, evolution is not only mutations but also recombination, deletion, insertion or methylation. Also, evolution isn't necessarily genetic changes, but also ecological changes or behavioural changes that influence the phenotype.\n\nThere is no way of quantifying these vast genetic, ecological and behavioural changes  to a point where we can accurately say \"Species x is mathmatecally more evolved than Species y.\" Even if between Species X and Species Y are millions of years, that is still impossible.",

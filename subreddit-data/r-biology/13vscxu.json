However, little is known about intracellular Pi\u00a0metabolism and signalling in animal tissues1. Following the observation that chronic Pi\u00a0starvation causes hyperproliferation in the digestive epithelium of Drosophila melanogaster, we determined that Pi\u00a0starvation triggers the downregulation of the Pi\u00a0transporter PXo. In line with Pi\u00a0starvation, PXo deficiency caused midgut hyperproliferation. Interestingly, immunostaining and ultrastructural analyses showed that PXo specifically marks non-canonical multilamellar organelles (PXo bodies). Further, by Pi\u00a0imaging with a F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Pi\u00a0sensor2, we found that PXo restricts cytosolic Pi\u00a0levels. PXo bodies require PXo for biogenesis and undergo degradation following Pi\u00a0starvation. Proteomic and lipidomic characterization of PXo bodies unveiled their distinct feature as an intracellular Pi\u00a0reserve. Therefore, Pi\u00a0starvation triggers PXo downregulation and PXo body degradation as a compensatory mechanism to increase cytosolic Pi. Finally, we identified connector of kinase to AP-1 (Cka), a component of the STRIPAK complex and JNK signalling3, as the mediator of PXo knockdown- or Pi\u00a0starvation-induced hyperproliferation. Altogether, our study uncovers PXo bodies as a critical regulator of cytosolic Pi\u00a0levels and identifies a Pi-dependent PXo-Cka-JNK signalling cascade controlling tissue homeostasis.",

He wrote, that one lake near to the Ussr border is Chinese. \n\nJust imagine, you are one of the \u224815 Ussr's gurders on the border and more than 200 chineses (hope this is right word) came to you and started a provocation, which lately changed to fucking war in this area. I don't remember who (I guess both) used fucking rocket artillery. \n\nIt's just so stupid, one lake for a lot of lives. Our lake remained our's. \n\nAnd then at 1990's Yeltsin just gave it to China, as a gift cause we are friends, lol",

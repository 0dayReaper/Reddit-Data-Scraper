Only those structures that reduce the rate of entropy production are preserved from one time point to the next: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20763722-why-information-grows\n\nFurthermore, it appears that the most successful genes are  preserved across species through a process of gene sharing: https://www.jorampiatigorsky.com/publications/gene-sharing-and-evolution-the-diversity-of-protein-functions/\n\n16 billion years is sufficient time for this universe to establish many stable and complex structures. \n\nAlso, current theories point to the origins of life in the thermo-chemical gradients of deep-sea hydrothermal vents. The primordial soup business is an old hypothesis. https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/education/earth/deep-sea-vents.html",

One specific study tested the speed at which Cin8 motors moved, their results yielded a range of about **25-55nm/s**, in the direction of the spindle poles.\\[27\\] On an individual basis it has been found that through the use of ionic conditions Cin8 motors can become as fast as **380nm/s**, a notable jump.\\[27\\] This tells us that Cin 8 can easily change directions on a microtubule, and in turn led to the plus end movement of kinesin on a microtubule.\\[27\\]",

As it arcs or ward, it twists the body in a way that kind of yanks the filament connected to the other \u2018footy, and a different but similar process happens on that side, which triggers the other foot, and on and on.

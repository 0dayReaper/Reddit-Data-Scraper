The square cube law states that for a given increase in body size, the volume and thus weight will increase at a much faster rate than the surface area of the object.\n\nNow if you look at the following aerodynamic equation mg=1/2rhoCdAV^2, rho being air density, Cd is the coefficient of drag, A the surface area and V velocity, you can see that both mass and surface area play a role here. Rearranging the equation to solve for V, it reads V= sqrt(2mg/rhoCdA). Thus, as mass increases much faster than area with larger creatures, terminal velocity increases as well, since the mass becomes larger but surface area below the line increases more slowly.\n\nFactor in that we can deliberately put our bodies into a diving pose to decrease our surface area even further, in a similar way to peregrine falcons actually, it makes sense that we can free-fall at much higher speeds.\n\nBasically we are faster because we\u2019re heavier and fatter.

The acceleration due to gravity is identical for all massive objects, but the force due to wind resistance depends mostly on cross sectional area.  Heavier objects don\u2019t experience extra wind resistance just from being heavy, so wind resistance causes less negative acceleration on heavier objects.  Heavier animals will be at a higher velocity once the force from wind resistance balances out the force of gravity.",

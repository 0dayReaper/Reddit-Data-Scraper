    "postText": "Hey! I\u2019m about to start college in fall and am currently enrolled for majoring in general biology and have my classes already. Recently, adults in my life are beginning to imply or straight up tell me this is a useless degree because I\u2019m not interested in pre-med, vet work, or pharmaceutical. I want to do lab research. I\u2019m specifically interested in evolution and ecology. I plan to do a 4 in 1 program my school offers in order to get my master\u2019s and out-compete other bio graduates, but I\u2019m beginning to lose confidence in my plan, especially because my advisor at my school told me yesterday \u201cwow, bio? Not biomed? I don\u2019t see many bio\u2019s here.\u201d and was accidentally signed up for a pre-med program because my advisor had assumed that\u2019s what I wanted. I love science, and I want to be someone who helps humanity discover more about it, but I\u2019m thinking of changing to marketing or communications to get a stable job. The university I\u2019m going to is private and very expensive, and I\u2019m paying for it all myself (obv taking out loans), so I just wanted to ask to anyone who had planned a career in bio or has a career, is it going to be worth it? I want the cold truth because I don\u2019t want to hate myself for a decision I made when I was 17.",

            "comment": "Speaking as someone with a masters in bio, specifically fisheries biology, and working for a state agency in the US, the biggest thing I see with new hires and young graduates is a miscommunication between expectations and reality. There are plenty of bio jobs in both the public and private sector, but the reality is that many of them are not \u201csexy\u201d, wanting to do research is great, but what your graduate advisors won\u2019t tell you is that those jobs are very few and far between outside of academia. The majority of bio work in the government sector is regulatory management, anything field or lab related is considered a \u201ctechnician\u201d job and will likely be severely underpaid (unless you\u2019re supervising field or lab work). By no means would this degree be worthless, but it might not lead to what you want it to in the long run. Unless you want to stay in academia forever and continue up to PhD, post-doc, etc\u2026",

If game warden or park ranger is something you\u2019re serious about, I would consider getting into environment law or even just straight law enforcement, a lot of those positions put much more emphasis on law enforcement experience than biology degrees or scientific background",

You could work in science communication, journalism, PR, education etc. It is always good to have a deep understanding about one subject and a degree and then you can spice your CV up with additional skills by doing jobs, internships, freelancer stuff, volunteering during your breaks. In case you want to work in research it may be a good idea to look into bioinformatics and statistics and take some courses, especially with your interest in ecology.\n\nedit: volunteering",

            "comment": "Sure a bio degree's worth it. No one has mentioned this kind of thing yet but two of my cousins are in niche-ish combined specialties (biophysics and biomechanical engineering). Both research and teach, but one has done government work before and the other's day job is designing and machining assistive devices for people (things like limb braces, ergonomic canes and prosthetics).\n\nYour family is worried about money because you're young and entering serious debt to do this. My advice is that because you're explicitly NOT going for medicine or any other cutthroat competitive specialty, you should either find a stable specialist job to feed yourself on or change majors to something not too onerous but financially secure. For me that was accounting many moons ago, but machines do that now -- pick something that you can learn quickly and immediately start doing good, consistent work in, so your relatives aren't afraid you're making a rash decision with severe financial consequences. If you can prove to them that you can support yourself while you pursue your passion (biology research and lab work) and at least partly cover any loans, they'll lay off and let you be a gentleperson scientist.\n\nRight now you're 17, lots of things are or could be The Dream For Real This Time. They probably remember it as not too long ago that you wanted to be a dinosaur. Your elders are concerned about what you'll practically and physically eat on when they're gone -- put that fear to rest with a profession you can use to pay for all the associated expenses, and they'll come around to science as a lifestyle. I wouldn't do accounting and personally I think business/marketing is a soulsucking hellscape -- but something like paralegal (4 weeks of certification, 50k a year, but you're basically a lawyer's valet) or phlebotomist (30k, a year or so - perfectly fine for one person) is always going to be in demand. Get a cert like that, pay for your studies out of your own pocket instead of taking a loan with interest -- then it will be much clearer that you're not, as it were, balling just to ball.",

            "comment": "the brutally cold truth is  : Statistics&gt; anecdotal advice .\n\nSo here it goes:\n\nAccording to [Zip-Recruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/blog/regret-free-college-majors/) recent survey . biology came in as the 9th most regretted major tied with English majors and the only science in the top 10.\n\nAccording to the [Foundation for Research and Equal Opportunity](https://freopp.org/is-college-worth-it-a-comprehensive-return-on-investment-analysis-1b2ad17f84c8) analysis of over 30,000 degree programs in the USA a whopping 31% of all biology graduates with a BS degree were found to have a NEGATIVE return on investment  over the course of 30 year career.  In other words, many Graduates with only a BS in biology are worse off financially then those with only  a High school diploma ( if you can believe it) .  To put this another way- Biology was found to be the 3rd worse degree in terms of a Return on investment- only art and theology majors had worse outcomes...\n\nAccording to the [Federal Reserve Bank of New York](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market/index.html#/outcomes-by-major) about 70% of all biology graduates earn a masters degree. Those with only a Bs are going to have a very hard time. However, even with such high levels of education attainment about 50% of these graduates ( most with masters degrees) are still UNDER-employed ( working in jobs that don't even  require their degrees) -- talk about bleak prospects.\n\nAnd according to [Nature Magazine](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03489-1) ( you might of heard of it) --  about 40% of phd /graduate students have depression!--  and its no surprise considering that it now take on average 8 years from start to finish to complete a PHD in biology ( the longest training of any PHd programs) and  that most PHD grads in biology end up in very low paid Post doc positions-- On the  NIH website a post doc with 5 years of experience  makes 60k-- talk about exportation.  in comparison a recent grad with a BS in Computer science makes 75k .\n\nDon't take my word word it- check out the links and do your own research.\n\nSo unless your 100% sure about going to graduate school , are 100% sure you'll  get into a 'Good'  graduate program ,are ok with the 50/50 odd of still being underemployed and underpaid, are ok with being clinically Depression ... then Biology might just be your cup of tea =)\n\nThere is also the 8 decades old \" Erooms law\" and t[erminal decline of the Pharmaceutical industry](https://endpts.com/pharmas-broken-business-model-an-industry-on-the-brink-of-terminal-decline/)   . ( google it)\n\nNot to mention that  Biology graduates tend to have one of the lowest average GPA's of any major ( I think chemistry majors might have it worse)-- so good luck with getting to grad school/ professional programs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBTW biology is not worthless, useless, meaningless,  or any other negative adjective- it is what it is =) It is however a great degree if your willing to sacrifice your health, income and family life.-\n\nGood luck.",

A MLT degree will also  prepare you well you for the Medical Laboratory science(CLS) BS degree since Most CLS programs require some lab experience and a mlt fulfils most prerequisites   .

    "postText": "I am looking for any paper that does this and I would like to use some fresh input of this subreddit.\n\nIs there any amplification pathways published that can be dedicated to one signal? Currently I'm thinking of some analog of cAMP or G protein that would not tamper with other pathways that share the substrate or enzyme. I was looking into receptors from non mammalian cells that have substrates not produced in mammalian cells. Ideally it should be switchable (turn on turn off). Like, hell, is there any enzyme that uses cyclic CMP or TMP?",

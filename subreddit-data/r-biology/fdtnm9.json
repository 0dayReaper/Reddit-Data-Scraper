Even if you don\u2019t have kids, I\u2019d say, your bro does, yeah it may not be yours directly, but given you have very similar genetic make up as siblings, your family\u2019s genetic strain would most likely survive.\n\nAlthough, on a side note, is that number accurate? Of all the billions of humans that have ever lived, 35% of that number of them never coupled up/mated and had kids? That\u2019s a sizable chunk, but I shouldn\u2019t be surprised given that we\u2019ve had unimaginable amounts of fatal conflicts over humanity\u2019s long history. \n\nI also take it most of that 35% of humans were men specifically, since we usually die more often for a variety of reasons, and in certain cases it\u2019s protecting the women. War obviously plays a huge part in that, since WW1 saw a whole generation of young men perish. Sad realities.",

Assuming Sasquatch is smaller, Gigantopithecus species evolving to Sasquatch meant they would\u2019ve required less food and space so would be more fit for survival in today\u2019s world. Gaining such a massive increase in size from Neanderthals to Sasquatch wouldn\u2019t really have been beneficial, maybe in terms of more musculature and hair to withstand the cold, but they\u2019d require too much food that just couldn\u2019t be acquired, especially during the glacial periods. Furthermore, there just hasn\u2019t been enough time for such a drastic change. It would be pretty cool, though lol",

The original sequenced Neanderthal genome from 2010 was from Croatia and there appears to be more affinity between that genome and modern Europeans. When comparing to a second Neanderthal genome sequenced in 2014 that came from Siberia, it looks like there's [more introgression into East Asians](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12886), though. Then there's the 2012 Denisovan genome as well, which seems to have left more traces in Southeast Asia and Melanesia.\n\nI think the story has to be that as *Homo sapiens* migrated through different parts of Eurasia from Africa, they hybridized with various groups of archaic humans that were already spread across the continent.",

Eugenics is just the idea that by encouraging reproduction between people with desirable traits and discouraging or preventing reproduction among people with undesirable traits, desirable traits will become more common in the population as a whole. It's absolutely not true that humans are all genetically the same. There are genetic differences among people that affect many of our traits.\n\nEugenics is really just the application of selective breeding to humans. It hasn't been \"debunked\" at all and selective breeding is still used in domesticated crops and animals all the time. Rather, what we have done is decide as a society that people's right to free determination of their lives is more important than any desire anyone might have to see certain traits become more common. That's a good decision in my opinion, but in order to maintain it we have to be clear that it's a moral decision, not a scientific one.",

Eugenics is, like I said in my last post, the application of selective breeding to humans. What you're referring to (the idea that differences among societies are due to genetic differences among races or ethnicities) is not eugenics. They may both broadly be classed under social Darwinism, but they are different aspects of it.\n\nAnd there definitely are differences among people in cognitive abilities and personality traits at least some of which are undeniably genetically heritable. What you are trying to say is that this variation among individuals is not associated with racial or ethnic groups, it's broadly distributed among all people both within and between populations. Any heritable variation among people is enough for eugenics/selective breeding to act on, though, so eugenics is not debunked.\n\nI'd say you're also making a claim beyond what any data actually support when you say that the idea that there are genetic differences between racial or ethnic groups is debunked. Debunked should mean that there's no realistic mechanism by which it could be true, which is not the case. There definitely are realistic mechanisms that could lead to cognitive or behavioral differences between related groups of people. There are differences in physical characteristics, disease susceptibility, and many other genetic traits, so no *a priori* reason why there couldn't also be cognitive or behavioral differences. Instead, what we *can* say is that there is no good evidence for any cognitive or behavioral differences between populations of humans. That doesn't mean the idea is debunked, just that it doesn't seem to be the case. Claiming that the idea is debunked is bad science in the name of good humanity. That's a good sacrifice to make when we can do good science and achieve even better humanity by pointing out that differences between groups, if they did exist, would not be equivalent to a ranking anyway. Diversity is a positive thing in biology as it is in culture because all traits involve trade offs of costs and benefits.",

We get our addictive personalities, our depression and loneliness, and even some other diseases and disorders from them. Their families and extended family in general were very small. \n\nIt\u2019s somewhat strange but they were all over the place and it\u2019s generally believed that their interbreeding with homosapiens is what led to civilization.\n\nEdit: I should mention that having 2-5% Neanderthal DNA is nothing to scoff about because it\u2019s not a small percentage at all, given how long ago they were believed to be extinct. That fact that we still have that much of them in our DNA shows something more permanent, or they were extinct much more recently than believed.",

Even the most appreciated scientists give no more than guesses on this matter.\n\nThe facts are that we have bones, basic drawings, some early built stone structures, traces of their food, proofs of fire use, data from genetics, etc. but in the end all these result in no more again but only hypothetical guesses. \n\nWe have no correct numbers from holocaust, from wars in the previous centuries when birth data was everywhere available. How would we want to fabricate correct explanations of what happened when large masses of different species met or clashed between 80000-40000 BC?\n\nJesus Christ could have lived about 20 generations ago. We have a book (bible). And some artifacts. And oral/written legends. But now imagine that the extintion of Homo Neanderthalensis happened somewhere between 400-900 human generations in the distant past. It's almost unthinkable how much happened that we will never understand. Wars, massacres, famines, genetical problems, (corona)viruses, etc. I think this infuriating fact is what makes people believe in hypothesis, because we humans can't bear simply saying \"that we know absolutely nothing\". Our imagination sticks to explanation as if those were closer to the absolute truth. But they are not.",

It is also the sort of Occam's razor so to speak based on what we know of evolutionary biology. We have found neanderthal remains all over Europe but many of the remains dated closest to modern day are found in places like coastlines where they lived on the fringe away from resource rich areas, likely because they were pushed out. Both direct and indirect competition are major stressors placed on a species and we likely directly competed with them for food and territory. As larger animal species dwindled at the end of the ice age and neanderthals could not longer meet their calorie intake by hunting them they were met with huge selective pressure. Because Homo sapiens had far lower nutritional requirements we could get by in time of scarcity while they could not. This is a theme in many mass extinction events such as when dust or ash has blocked sunlight globally and plants started to die off, it is the smaller and hardier species that survive while the larger creatures are forced to starve.\n\nEverything outside of the most recent past events in our history is clouded or obscured. Without the time machines of science fiction there is no way for us to know many things with absolute certainty. instead we gather evidence and build upon what we do know to make our best logical guesses, we form hypotheses and when those stand the test of scrutiny we get theories and we use those every day. If you wish to forward a more likely answer to the question \"what happened to the neanderthals?\" by all means do so, but simply saying \"you can't know for sure\" can be said about just virtually everything.",

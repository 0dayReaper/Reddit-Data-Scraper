    "postText": "I ask here because I don't trust gym communities. \n\nThere is a cap of muscle protein synthesis after consuming a certain amount of protein, for example 40g every few hours. So if I eat 150g at once like I used to, I should have only grown an amount of muscle that results from a single protein feeding, no? \n\nIn a study done by PhD Layne Norton he found in rats that evenly distributed protein intake resulted in 8-10% more muscle mass. A short term human study in Japan found that evenly distributed protein intake resulted in 2.5% more muscle mass (Could have read the study wrong, I'm no academic).\n\nIf there are 4-5 opportunities for muscle protein synthesis a day, shouldn't the difference in muscle growth be 4x or 5x greater for distributed protein compared to one feeding? Why is my understanding of the mechanism of the anabolic cap during one meal so conflicting with the results from experiments?",

Many people either don't know or don't care about using the singular term, and decide to treat the plural version of the word to also mean singular. \n\nI hear you though.  It irks me sometimes, but I don't expect scientists to be experts in English. It's a different field, as long as they get their point across and it isn't something that completely obscures meaning I just ignore the part of my brain that goes consistency. Similar to the word octopi. I'm certainly no English expert.",

Another is because of it's Latin origins, English speakers conjugate \"wrong\". Either way or doesn't matter too much -- language is always evolving and if you want to sound fluent you have to follow what is commonly done.",

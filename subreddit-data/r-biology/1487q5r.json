On the underside of the hind foot is a hard, dark \"spade\" that gives spadefoot toads their name. These creatures can grow to be 3.5\" in length. These \"spades\" are used by the toads to burrow into the ground to prevent water loss and hide from predators.\n\nCouch\u2019s Spadefoot\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couch%27s_spadefoot_toad",

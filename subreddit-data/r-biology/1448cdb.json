    "title": "Fun fact: beetles from the Oedemeridae family contain a poison and burning agent called \"Cantharidin\". This is named after the Spanish Fly, which is neither a fly nor part of the Cantharidae beetle family. They are however part of the Meloidae family, also known as Blister Beetles.",

After I smacked it, I grabbed it and saw it was a black  beetle. It Just looked like an average black ground beetle. All of a sudden my neck started burning really really bad and I ran to the bathroom to rinse it with water. It burned layers of my skin off and I still have a scar on my neck from it.",

After a few hours of irritation and me thinking it was just some sand, I took off my shoe and found the flattest Oedemeridae beetle I've ever seen lol. All its bodily fluids had been soaking into my sock and skin. \nNow 2 days later the blister is still as big as it was without any change.",

At the beginning it was just irritating, like there was a small thorn stuck in my sock, but now the blister itself doesn't really hurt. Touching it doesn't hurt, but I do feel a little bit of a burning sensation underneath the blister.",

So when I found out the hard way that Oedemeridae cause blisters, I did some research.\n\nI found that the poison was called Cantharidin, which I found was strange, because as far as I knew beetles from the Cantharidae are harmless. \n\nHowever, the beetle that the poison was named after (cantharide or Spanish Fly), was first thought to be of the Cantharidae family, but it was actually part of the Meloidae family(blister beetles).\n\nI then googled Spanish Fly, and the first thing that pops up is the aphrodisiac.",

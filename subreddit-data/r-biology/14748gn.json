Maybe oxygen supply was one of these factors when some insects were very large, but probably not the only factor. \n\nSo my answer would be no, they would probably not evolve to become larger in a contained environment with higher oxygen concentration.",

            "comment": "A sealed environment with increased oxygen concentration would indeed raise the physical limitations on the size of insects and other air breathing arthropods, as their breathing method implies passive oxygen diffusion through their body.\n\nHowever, this alone won't make them bigger, there needs to be some kind of selective pressure in favour of a size increase. In such a controlled environment, the easiest is by far artificial selection. This should also greatly reduce the number of generations needed to have an observable effect.\n\nIt might also be possible to get an individual insect to grow much bigger than average, by genetic engineering or hormonal treatment, but I don't know enough about the developement of insects to know the feasibility of this possibility.",

There is a limit that cant be surpassed as they cant fly, which is important thing to live you know.",

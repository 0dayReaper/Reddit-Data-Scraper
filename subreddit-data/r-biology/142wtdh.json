    "postText": "So our bodies have some primal defence mechanism with our nails against other humans? Something similar to not being able to tickle yourself?\n\nA more detailed how to I guess: This requires 2 people, person (A)takes persons (B)'s finger preferably not freshly cut nails. Tells them to relax their hand and person (A) will \"scrape\" persons (B)'s finger against their skin. This works even better if you have calluses. Person (B) will have a sensation as if they are about to gouge person (A)'s skin.\n\nMe and my girlfriend randomly came across this as we were laying down. She just so happened to rub her thumb across my thumbs nail and i got this crazy sensation! Doesn't work on objects only other humans from the testing we did.\n\nI cant find any research on this either. I am also dying to get more data and want to hear everyone's experiences or hopefully some detailed break down on what's going on.",

It's also pretty crazy if you actually test this.\n\nIt may be a stretch I know, and my desperate attempts to get any answers was like, \"I mean it's technically biology since its pretty broad term to begin with\".\n\nBut from personal testing 5 including me felt the insane urge to pull away. 2 felt nothing but are around 60 and arnt in the best physical health. But 1 was basically in the middle, they felt the sensation but not as bad. But they were also around 60 and dealing with physical health.",

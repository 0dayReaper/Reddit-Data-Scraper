Can't trust the guy who used the lab assistant from a reputable BMI research lab to recreate, poorly, old experiments from the mentors lab and claim it a their original breakthroughs.  Said lab assistant slinkned away after being told to do so by said mentor if he wanted to salvage his career before mentor slapped him down.  Neurolink has basically maimed/killed its animal test subjects, unless Elon wanted a way out of his current predicament he'd never volunteer.",

    "postText": "This is going to be a farfetched one:\n\n* In most RPG's you can choose between different races (DnD has 9 in the core rulebook, PF2e has 6).\n* In Star Trek Enterprise when they meet the Xindi, they make a point of the fact that having several sapient races on one planet is pretty much unheard of. I'm assuming it's like how there are no neanderthals alive today, that the different races kill each other of.\n\nNow to the question: How big would any of the populations be if there were several species that (presumably) can't mate with each other. Or is it more likely that there would only be one species left?",

I mean were not even sure how just the human species will develope population wise in the future. You could possibly look at other smart animal species on earth such as the cetacea family (like another comment mentioned) but eh.",

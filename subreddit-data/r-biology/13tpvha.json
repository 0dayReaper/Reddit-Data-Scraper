I always thought that if I did get a tattoo it would be of Darwin\u2019s \u201cI think\u2026\u201d tree of life from his notebook. \n\nSo for your cladogram, time is represented on the Y axis, so any lines that don\u2019t reach the top would be representing extinct species/lineages. Every line representing an extant (living) lineage should be level with each other along the top. Hope that helps.",

I should've specified, this is a mockup in mspaint so I'll make sure the lines are all even in the final version :) \n\nDo you think the evolutionary relationships are okay? I'm having trouble understanding if annelids and molluscs are sister groups, or if arthropods and annelids are. Maybe it doesn't even change the tattoo but I'm finding so many differing opinions online.",

It's technically the same, just a matter of convention.\n\nSecond, of course this leaves off a whole heap of really cool phyla, although I think you know that already.\n\nThird, I'd hesitate to get a phylogenetic tree tattoo because of how often phylogeneticists change their mind.  Give it a decade or two and there's a good chance this tree will be all shuffled around.  Just recently, for example, I saw a paper that argued chordates should be grouped with protostomes, and echinoderms should be split off as their own thing.  And there's a bunch of arguments about the relative position of ctenophores, sponges, cnidarians, and bilaterians.",

Like most people I'm heavily biased towards vertebrates, esp tetrapods, and I was thinking about doing a tree for them instead, but I couldn't figure out a way of doing it that didn't seem either too simple or arbitrarily exclusive. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's good to keep in mind, thank you! I had no idea that people were still arguing against things as 'rock solid (how I learned them to be in college)' as chordates being dueterosomes! I'd love a cladogram because I think the diversity and evolutionary history of life is absolutely stunning and profound--maybe i'll just get an undifferentiated one.",

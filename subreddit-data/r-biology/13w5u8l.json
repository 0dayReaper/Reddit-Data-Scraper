    "postText": "I\u2019m reading \u201csapiens\u201d by yuval noah harari and there\u2019s a bit in here where he claims that humans mature/reproduce later in life during times of hardship. But this doesn\u2019t seem to be true in most other species. Plants typically flower under poor soil conditions and drought conditions. Which makes sense, if an organism senses itself dying, it makes a last ditch and more resource intensive effort to reproduce. Same with fungi, if a tree is hosting a fungus that\u2019s part of a larger network, if the tree falls and the fungus is cut off from its network, it produces mushrooms. So I\u2019m just puzzled as to why it would be opposite for humans. It seems like an evolutionary disadvantage to delay or limit reproduction when resources are scarce. Does anybody have some insight?",

Plants, fungi and even insects can have a large reproductive event and it might be successful even if the parent dies. However Humans require intensive care of the offspring to make reproduction worth it. In a time of stress, having children doesn\u2019t make sense as a \u201clast ditch effort\u201d becsuse the children just won\u2019t survive. Instead humans play the long game, like many other larger mammals. They are better off letting the adults stay alive until conditions become better.",

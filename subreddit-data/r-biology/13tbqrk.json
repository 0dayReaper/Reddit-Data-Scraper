This orchid seems a bit different than those, the \"basket\" is pretty dry and it doesn't look like it connects to the pollen sacks. But maybe the process is a bit different but it serves the same purpose?",

Pollen is typically made to be quite \u201csticky\u201d on its own, at least in relation to the shape/texture of the pollinator with which it co-adapted.\n\nInstead of the particular basket shape or contents, it\u2019s more related to positioning in association with the staminode. The insect must crawl past as it escapes, collecting and/or depositing pollen along the way.",

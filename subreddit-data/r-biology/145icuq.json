Simply not possible, breathing slow or fast, you\u2019re going to have CO2 still in your lungs.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t adversely , though, as the concentration of CO2 in your blood will be higher than the concentration of CO2 in your lungs. No matter what it is, unless energy is put in to drive it against the concentration gradient, it imeans that the CO2 will always be diffusing from high concentration (in blood) to low concentration (in lungs).\n\nEdit, don\u2019t science after a migraine.",

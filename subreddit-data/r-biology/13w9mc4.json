If your professor/teacher is using the textbook\u2019s question bank to generate their quizzes/exams/assignments, using the textbooks\u2019s online resources will make you more familiar with how exam questions will be worded, and should make everything a little easier.  \n\nThere are a ton of sites out there for bio review, and most scientific terms are universal, but how they approach the subject matter may differ. When I needed to learn terms, I usually made flash cards.  For bio concepts, if you try to use the terms you need to learn to help describe and understand them, whether by writing them down or saying them out loud, it will help.  \n\nAll that being said, summer science courses are tough!  You really don\u2019t have time to think about the material properly.  Might be a good idea to keep your course materials for reference, for when you hit your other bio courses in the fall.  Good luck with your studies.",

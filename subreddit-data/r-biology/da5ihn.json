It's forbidden to open and close this lid with your hand when you put your PCR plate inside, or else you would damage the instrument (there is a button to open the lid, another button to close it). Still, closing the lid manually is a natural thing and Bio-Rad representatives told us that this is the most frequent reason of breakage for this model. We had to write the warning about it in HUGE letters on the lid itself because this PCR mashine is used all the time by all the people in the lab, and we can't afford to repair it.",

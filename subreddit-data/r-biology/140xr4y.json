    "postText": "Hello everyone. I\u2019m new to this subreddit and thought this would be a good place to get other perspectives and or ideas. I\u2019m just a average guy with no college degree or any fancy labels. I do however have a passion for reptiles. I know that\u2019s a lot of different species to love so let\u2019s narrow that down to snakes, and further down to venomous. Idk how people in this subreddit feel about owning exotic venomous snakes so please don\u2019t bash me. I love \u2018em lol. But I\u2019m here because have you ever googled the worlds fastest striking snake?? Depending on the article you read it could be the death adder, puff adder, gaboon viper and it goes on and on. And if u try to find any research on the subject it\u2019s very little. So I\u2019m going to try to give the world these answers in a controlled environment. Also want to see if a feeding response strike is faster than a defensive strike. These tests will be done weekly , bi weekly or monthly depending on the species and how often I feed it. My idea is to have 1\u201dx1\u201d grid paper line the bottom and sides of the tank. I will get the length weight temp and humidity prior to each test. I\u2019m hoping I get some great feedback from this and let me know if you all know a better way",

Like puffs gaboons death adders and so on. I know people who have snakes from all over the world. And want to test as many as I can throughly to get a more accurate and overall average",

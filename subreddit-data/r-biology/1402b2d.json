            "comment": "So, a residue is the functional group that hangs off the peptide backbone of the amino acid. They can be altered in lots of ways. In general, they can be methylated, phosphorylated, acetylated, glycosylated, etc. They can also be mutated either from external factors, or there could be a mutation that changes the amino acid and therefore changes the residue.\n\nIn the DNA repair pathway, there are a lot of posttranslational modifications, and specifically phorphoylation and methylation are common, so that would be my guess without knowing about tardigrade genetics specifically.\n\nHere is a paper about the role of posttranslational modifications in DNA repair.\n\nhttps://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/7493902/",

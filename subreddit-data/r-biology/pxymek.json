            "comment": "For those wondering, this was not taken with atomic force microscopy. \n\nThis looks like a shadowed TEM micrograph. Basically, a high density metal is deposited onto one side of the sample at an angle. When you image this in a TEM, the electrons are scattered by metal, and are therefore not detected. To the TEM operator, the areas where the metal is deposited would appear dark, and the areas without metal appear bright. This gives a high contrast, \"3D\" appearance. \n\nThey're usually presented as a negative, meaning high density (metal) areas appear bright, and low density non coated areas appear dark. This makes it look like a shadow. But what you're really seeing is areas where metal was, and was not deposited.\n\nEdit: I decided to reverse image search it, and it is indeed a shadowed TEM. \n\nhttps://www.alamy.com/transmission-electron-micrograph-shadowed-of-a-t4-bacteriophage-a-virus-that-infects-only-bacteria-in-this-case-only-escherichia-coli-phages-lack-image335365933.html",

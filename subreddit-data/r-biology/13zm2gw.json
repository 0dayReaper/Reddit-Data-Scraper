    "postText": "I am looking for art/stuff related to anything about the natural world so like paleo art, botanical illustrations, diversity, animals extinct/extant. I know about [Studio 252MYA](https://252mya.com/collections/prints) I like what they have but I dont see a lot of Botany related art and I would like to know what other options are out there. I dont really have an exact style I am looking just as long as its biology/nature related is. \n\nThanks",

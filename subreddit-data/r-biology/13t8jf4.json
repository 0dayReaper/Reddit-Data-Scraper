    "postText": "It came up in a conversation at school when we were talking about how some people can think in sounds and some with visuals. Turns out my friend can only dream in black and white, there is no colour in any of his dreams. He also thinks only in black and white. He'd never thought of it as something different because when he discussed it with another classmate, she thought in black and white as well.  \nBoth of them, however, can recall colours. For eg if i asked him to remember the colour of something, he could recall it and also voluntarily think of colours. But it took some effort.  \nOn further aNaLysIs lmao even his mother dreams and thinks only in black and white. So. like we predicted. it seems to be genetic. But why does this happen? On looking it up we only found some research that found 12% of the population dreams in bw and that dreaming in colour as a positive correlation with creativity.  \nI asked him to ask his mom if he had issues in preschool while learning colours maybe? My hypothesis is that he perceives colour but somewhere while storing it as a long term memory, there is a disconnect between the cortexts and the hippocampus. The memory for eg the visuals of a place get stored in the hippocampus with colour (which is why he can recall colours voluntarily when asked to do so) but while performing cognitive functions like thinking of the place , there is some disconnect between the hippocampus and cortexts that causes him to think of the place in black and white only. This slight disconnect could also be the reason, he sees the place in black and white while even dreaming of it.  \nidk why this happens but it doesnt affect him in any way, he is normal, undiagnosed with any disorders/sleep issues and is pretty sharp lol.  \nOpen to any theories/ reasons and resources thankyou.",

    "postText": "I remember learning that the Portuguese man of war (physalia physalis) is considered to be a colony: it is an animal that is composed of functionally specialized components that have their own structures and are analogous to separate individuals. Why aren't humans beings colonies too then? We also are a collection of components that arise (or \"bud\") from the same original organism. For us also, the components cannot live independently but they have their own separate structures and functions. White blood cells are traveling around looking for invading microbes. Cardiac cells will try to beat alone in a petrie dish. Sperm will completely swim away from all the other body parts. These components (along with many others) are conducting their activities all the time without our control or knowledge. Seems as much like a colony as the man of war?",

It seems to odd to me now that all the many sources that point this animal out as a colony (and I read a bunch of them before submitting this question) don't emphasize this aspect of that designation. Much appreciated!",

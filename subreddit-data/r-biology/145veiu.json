Thus, you will see fewer bacteria.\n\nBeing able to simultaneously see millions of bacteria is largely not useful, and not what microscopes are designed/used for. \n\nI work with nematodes, not bacteria, but I\u2019m sure there are combinations of bacteria and viewing methods that allows you to see many. Perhaps not millions, because like I said, to see them clearly you need to zoom in, and depending on how large the strain is you may need to zoom in such that you do not capture as many in the focus.",

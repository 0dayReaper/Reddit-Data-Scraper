The mucus provides an effective barrier to bacterial infection and expands in the water to spread the eggs apart from one another and allow adequate oxygen supply to the whole mass. It might also provide protection from some predators... and all fairly efficiently from the point of view of the mother.",

The fact that natural human life expectancy is closer to 55 or 60 years (depending on sex) is independent from the biological expectation of reproduction. Most social animals display this disparity; rabbits can reproduce within months of being born, but can comfortably live for over a decade in the wild. Survival for rabbits &amp; humans is not the key to our success.",

It's not JUST about being able to reproduce. It's about being successful in your environment. It's about being able to fend off predators. It's about being able to utilize resources. It's complex, and it's why there are so many different indices for measuring competition and success in species, and why it's so easy to shit on someone else's research. \n\nAlso, there are some big glaring difference in reproduction and survival strategy with humans and rabbits. Obviously there are other evolutionary drivers in our development, because we birth kids with heads big enough to kill the women birthing them, and we can usually only get one out per year. Rabbits can make dozens and dozens of offspring.",

The ostrich egg being the biggest egg is referring to the shelled thing that is laid by the female ostrich. \n\nSo no, that squid egg is not a single cell.",

While they\u2019re definitely not written as professionally as possible, is it possible for me to convert these into technical reports? Also is there a guide for the same?",

If I determine there is a novelty (new gene discovered, or a new function, for example), I\u2019d go to my advisor (mentor, PI, professor) with that finding, and ask for help with the next steps.",

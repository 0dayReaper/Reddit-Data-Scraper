They'll gobble them up as quick as they hatch.\n\nYou can buy *[Bacillus thuringiensis](https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/mosquito-control/community/bti.html)* bacteria to put in the water. It kills them before they become adults, and is quite safe for everyone else.\n\nAnd, of course, simply emptying the barrel at least once a week is effective, if you can.",

So, unless the eggs are consequently being washed down a storm drain or into a pond or persistent puddle, it is still an effective way to get rid of them.",

The low amount of soap is not supposed to harm the grass but the mosquitos land on grass and the soap messes with the feet so that the skeeter can't stay afloat on the water to lay eggs. We've had unusual amounts of rain in our area and expect a skeeter epidemic.",

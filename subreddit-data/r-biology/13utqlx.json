I\u2019ve been on plenty beaches to get me some walrus cock, and then a bear shows up. It might walk right passed me. Maybe 10 to 15 feet. I\u2019m not talking about a black bear either. Talking 10 foot brown bears and grizzlies.  They never paid much attention to me, because they just wanted a dead rotten walrus. I got to thinking, why would any mammal more than capable of killing a human or most animals it comes across, rather eat something that putrid? It\u2019s one of the grossest things I have ever smelled. If you get that rotten blood on your clothes or your skin, the smell won\u2019t come off, I threw some sweatshirts through the washer and dryer 10 times and it\u2019s still smelly. I got it on my hands, washed them over and over and over. I was scrubbing them and all that. It took over a week before my hand didn\u2019t smell. Anyways I came to the conclusion that living organisms will choose the easy meal every time. Bears dont want to do the work of chasing me down and killing me. The same way sharks always go for animals that look sick, dying, malnourished, and old. \nI don\u2019t know why I felt the urge to share that with you guys but that\u2019s a very important lesson that I\u2019ve learned \u201cin the field\u201d.",

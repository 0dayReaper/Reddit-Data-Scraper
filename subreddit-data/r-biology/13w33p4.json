    "postText": "so for my thesis we unfortunately ran out of plant extract and we weren\u2019t able to conduct tests to determine MIC, nor were we able to find the inhibition zone of the plant extract alone against S. aureus.\n\nthe only results we have are the inhibition zones for our antibiotic alone, antibiotic + 100 mg/mL plant extract, and antibiotic + 200 mg/mL plant extract.\n\nwe think there is positive synergism because the inhibition zones of the combination treatments are larger than the inhibition zone of the antibiotic alone but we don\u2019t know how to quantify it. is there any way to quantify synergism given only the inhibition zones of the treatments?",

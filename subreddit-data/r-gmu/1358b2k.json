    "postText": "I saw a post about missing Mason so much. Well here are my top places to shit at Mason.\n\n1. College Hall (Top floor) - The toliet seats are ALWAYS UP (iykyk). There is barely any foot traffic though maybe 1 out of 20 times someone shows up.\n2. Merten Hall (First Floor) - The \"newest\" building in my list I think? The restroom is located in the back where the stoarge rooms are and the classroom is up front by the entrance. I rarely see people go to that restroom so its pretty quiet. Maybe 1 out of 10 times there is someone else there. \n3. Old Fenwick Library (floor 3 and above) - I put this as my third because there is always something new to read on the stalls and it is pretty funny lol. Avoid the first one because the tiles reflect and people can see your behind.\n\nWell tbh these three places are the only places I go to since it's always open lol",

I used to work at the book store so that\u2019s how I know they exist. Even after I quit the book store, they were my go to bathrooms. No one ever stopped me to ask if I was an employee.",

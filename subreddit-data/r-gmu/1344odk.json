If you really want, just scramble like 15 of them at once and meal prep them with some rice or something and then you have breakfast for a week. But yea if you're really desperate just crack them and scramble them (don't cook them just scramble) and portion them into plastic bags and freeze them and you can just defrost in the fridge the night before you cook them. I don't see how this is an issue tho, it's just 2 eggs a day which isn't too bad unless you meant april 16th lol. 2 eggs a day isn't enough for cholesterol issues or anything. \n\nAlso idk why I got recommended this I have nothing to do with GMU but hopefully I helped",

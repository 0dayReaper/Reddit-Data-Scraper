            "comment": "I took 483 in the summer with him last year and for me it wasn\u2019t as bad as I was expecting. The easiest way to do well is to basically study a little bit every day, and focus as much as you can during class because the class is fast paced. There are two tests and a project. I actually just didn\u2019t the do the project and ended with a C because I did really well on the exams even though the project wasn\u2019t too difficult I was just burnt out from the spring semester. Personally I liked his class because the tests allowed you to demonstrate your knowledge and understanding rather than just being super easy and formulaic.\n\nThe best you can do is try to understand all the algorithms, like what steps to take, and their big O.",

At least that\u2019s what it was for my class because our first test average was 42 and I can\u2019t remember the second test but it was probably in the 40s too. These numbers aren\u2019t concrete but definitely shoot for a 60 or higher and you\u2019ll end with a really good grade if you do the project he assigns.\n\nLike I said I didn\u2019t do the project and got a C even though it was supposed to be 30% of our grade.",

    "postText": "Happy AAPI month. I overheard mixed stories about a racist encounter at the JC a couple nights ago and whether it got reported to Mason PD. Just curious to know what happened because it seemed like a huge deal. Had to do with some asian orgs or something? I also had racial and sa issues with people at mason but I never really bothered to report it because you know.. Mason doesn\u2019t do anything",

Hate should not be tolerated but honestly, she is trying very hard to escalate the situation to higher authority but it likely won\u2019t result in much. She has no proof/recording of the situation happening except for a picture of the guys who did it. If you yourself have experienced a similar situation I would suggest to report it if you have tangible evidence so that the people can experience consequences.Without any hard proof it will be hard for Mason to make any judgments or punishments.",

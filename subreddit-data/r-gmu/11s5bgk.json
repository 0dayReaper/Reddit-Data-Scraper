You can find a screenshot guide on how to roommate group in the resource center on the housing portal. If you and your current roommates decide to live together next year, then you form a group together. If not, you can find a new group or select a space as an individual",

HRL keeps specific dorms open over the summer for summer stays. Idk if this would be ideal for the OP though. There is a possibility that you could stay in the same dorm if your dorm happens to be the one of the ones that is kept open.  \n\n\nedit1: clarity",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, i\u2019m currently attending NVCC and I have no idea which college to pick. The major I\u2019m aiming for is either Accounting, OSM or MIS at Mason, and BIT-OSM or ACIS at Tech. It\u2019s a wide range I know, but it\u2019ll narrow down in the next two semesters. \n\nI\u2019m about to be a sophomore, and I need to know which college to pick so every credit will transfer. I\u2019m also planning on taking CLEP Exams for Gen Ed\u2019s, and both schools have different required exams for them. I\u2019m really not trying to retake a class at either college. Saying this I\u2019d like to know the pros and cons of attending George Mason over Virginia Tech and vice versa. I posted the same question on the [r/VirginiaTech](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=1) forum and I got some really good answers and feedback, I\u2019d like to know the perspective from a Mason student too. \n\nFor reference, I live 40 minutes from the main campus of GMU, so commuting wouldn\u2019t be hard at all. Family is great, I don\u2019t get charged rent or utilities as long as I get good grades, so financially speaking GMU would save me thousands. However, I don\u2019t know how strong it\u2019s alumni presences is and it\u2019s job/internship opportunities are compared to Tech. Tech has the name brand, alumni and ranking compared to GMU, with a lot of opportunities, but location is less than ideal and it\u2019ll be much more expensive. \n\nOverall, i\u2019d really like to hear your feedback and opinions on either university. It would help a lot!",

            "comment": "For the degrees your contemplating I would suggest GMU. GMU does an excellent job in the accounting/MIS/IT departments, better than Tech in those areas imo. \n\nAlso I would factor in money. College housing is *expensive* especially when your attending a university in the middle of nowhere. Being able to commute from your house at minimal expense is a huge money saving perk. And last time I checked, GMU is cheaper per credit than at Tech.\n\nNow anything Engineering related, go to Tech if you can get in. They have one of the best engineering schools in the world.",

As for location, anywhere in NOVA works, I\u2019m comfortable commuting an hour or so, but D.C is probably the farthest I\u2019d go, maybe southern Maryland if I\u2019m really not lucky.",

When i interned, I think there were only 2 GMU students, including myself and the rest were all VTech. They do have a stronger recruiting presence there bc their alumni are all from VTech lol.\n\nI\u2019m also a transfer from NVCC, i just graduated Mason this spring. I ended undergrad with 4 internships and full time offers (yes, i did get a full time offer from the big 4) It\u2019s all about how YOU use your time and how willingly you want to succeed",

I started fall 22 semester as a transfer student from NVCC. As long as you show that you\u2019re the right candidate they will give you a shot! The MIS program at Mason is pretty good in my opinion.",

He gave up on keeping an IT job a few years after graduation... Another BIT graduate friend owns a Blacksburg area painting business, still lives in town.\n\nMy closest MIS GMU graduate friend is a network engineer for the FAA, has a house in Arlington, plays music in the DC area.\n\nA VAST majority of VT graduates I know seem to stay for graduate school (or some other sort of placement) and it's been a harsh 50-50 on if it worked for them... The most important thing I can tell you is that this area has virtually nothing compared to NOVA, especially in the Business IT field... Sure, it's a beautiful, quiet place but most any town along the Appalachian mountains fits that description.\n\nIt's hard to put in words, but the DC area offers just so much more 'real-life' experience and opportunities, especially in your field of interest....Whereas being in Blacksburg is synonymous with being at VT.\n\nThese are supposed to be the most saturated, important years of your life &amp; I don't care about sportsball, so I wanted the hell away from there.",

I think they are better structured from an academic perspective as a whole. If money is a factory, go to Mason. If you are looking for job placement, I think BIT would be better, although the big four recruits from both. I would recommend against ACIS unless you would like to get your CPA, but please note you would have to do thr masters or do a dual bachelors to meet 150 credit CPA requirement.",

It\u2019s a great school and there are TONS on internships opportunities you just need to know where to look and use your resources. I say go with Mason it will save you so much money on the long run plus it\u2019s closer to DC which is ideal for opportunities.",

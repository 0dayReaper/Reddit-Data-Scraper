On a tennis court the boundaries are more of a suggestion, I\u2019d preferably like to hit deep backhands from behind the baseline. On the racquetball court you can\u2019t get near the walls or you\u2019re gonna shorten your swing/hit the wall, so there\u2019s a lot less space. It makes a big difference. It\u2019ll have to do for now but only for small sessions, otherwise it messes up my motion as I\u2019m less inclined to use my full body to hit, instead using the arm due to the lack of space",

    "postText": "...when you could easily hold a town hall at a university. \n\nIf you don't want to show up to a town hall, great. But one wants to have an celebration of academic achievement stained by controversy and all this bs. They admit to it being deeply personal and painful to many. There are a million different people that could give an inspiring speech. It's not even a big deal if they hold so much clout. \n\nBut a place for debate? When has a commencement speech been the time or place for that? 17 days ago, there was a town hall with Youngkin to debate and discuss these issues. It is a much better opportunity to \"safely engage in debate and discourse\" or \"...expose [others] to people and ideas that may offend or challenge them, but in an environment of steadfast support and safety, so they may develop the agency to effectively express and advocate\" to use their own words. Because they do apparently \"believe\" in it.\n\nI think this is a load of crap and we all know this email was just to cover their asses because they know they didn't have to make now the time and place for this. I'm not a student anymore, so please make them look stupid by reminding people that this is what a town hall is for.",

Perhaps if people are that concerned they should put in a little more effort around election time by canvassing, volunteering, and voting (if you\u2019re a resident) to ensure their preferred person becomes governor. The youth bracket (18-29) was the only one that favored McAuliffe in 2021 (all others favored Youngkin), and only about a quarter of that bracket actually voted. And Youngkin only won by like 64,000 votes... If the youth turnout was anywhere near the rest of the state\u2019s (about 54%), McAuliffe probably would have won.",

Especially if you narrow the approval of a few of the mentioned issues and his position. And then the approval in Fairfax and surrounding counties. Or even broadly in the US because students come from all over country and quite a few are international.Then the fact that we are objectively looking at issues that are personal and legislation on these issues directly affect lives. And if a lot of students are holding protests, arguing about this, signing petitions and the President had to send an email to everyone, I think that it is an indicator of controversy whether anyone thinks it is a big deal or not.\n\nBut I think a lot of it can also come to the possibility of him running for GOP nominee and the politics of everything overshadowing the commencement. You could even say it's Mason's decision to opt to stick with this even though there was an opportunity to change to someone that'd bring less drama is what is controversial about the actual commencement. If that makes sense. People mad about Youngkin and Mason.\n\nI really appreciate that you agree with the whole town hall idea.",

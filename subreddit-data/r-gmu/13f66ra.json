I was just eating a cliff bar and she called me out for eating a cliff bar, it was the most insane thing.",

She pretty much just let power get to her head b/c honestly, we don't really have much jurisdiction over what people in the library do unless we get a complaint about noise. She works in a different department, but my department also does rounds around the library so I can safely tell you that we don't care whether or not you eat, or if you have a mask on/off in the library. All we ask is that you don't leave a mess",

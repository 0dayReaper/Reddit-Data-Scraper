    "postText": "Hey guys, I am a senior who will be graduating in December. I live with family rent free in Richmond, so far so good; however, I will have to be at campus M-Th next semester. I'm just looking for the cheapest housing option a senior can get that doesnt require a meal plan, as none of my stuff except a travel bag will be on campus with me. Any suggestions? This is my first time looking at housing, and can I only be there for one semester?",

Even if you can\u2019t condense the classes you might just want to try commuting, my former coworker did Richmond to Chantilly 5 days a week for years when we worked together so you can probably do 4 days a week for a semester.",

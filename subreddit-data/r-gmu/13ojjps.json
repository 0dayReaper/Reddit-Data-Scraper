            "comment": "If u don\u2019t mind taking physics and differential equations I guess it\u2019s an ok decision. You should only switch if u like doing cybersecurity stuff like Networking  or ethically hacking  and are willing to do extra work outside of class like getting certs and competing in CTFs. Just know that a lot of the profs aren\u2019t great. I would probably not switch majors and focus on getting skills from the Mason Cyber club and getting certs if I was halfway through the CS degree. I\u2019d say look at the degree requirements before making your decision. \n\nhttps://catalog.gmu.edu/colleges-schools/engineering-computing/engineering/cyber-security-engineering/cyber-security-engineering-bs/#requirementstext",

This means you will take six Math Classes, two Physics Classes, a Statistic Class, and Electrical, Systems, and Computer Engineering Classes, plus your core computer coding classes, on top of all the CYSE classes you must take. It helps to be interested in Cyber Security before taking on this program.",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI applied for the MS in SWE this week. For some background, I am a Business major with a double concentration in MIS and Accounting. I have also taken 3 of the foundational courses [outlined in the MS in SWE catalog](https://catalog.gmu.edu/colleges-schools/engineering-computing/school-computing/computer-science/software-engineering-ms/#admissionspoliciestext): IT106, IT206, and MATH125 which I got all As in. I also have a 3.95 GPA with 137 credits, but I have little to no work experience in the field of software engineering though I have around two years of administrative internship experience.\n\nWhat are my chances of being accepted for the fall semester? I am aiming for provisional acceptance to where I am allowed to start taking the core classes of the program after I finish up the two foundational requirements. Also, how long should I expect to hear back? Thanks!",

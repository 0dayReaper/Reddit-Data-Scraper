I\u2019ve lived on campus for about a year and a half and if you\u2019re trying to have party just follow gmuparties on ig, you\u2019re bound to find something on a quiet Saturday night. The campus is beautiful and theres actually a lot going on in regard to clubs and other stuff, you just have to find it. I personally love the school and it\u2019s a good school. Just do your research on professors, don\u2019t fuck around and you\u2019ll be good. I transferred to gmu from a community college and I actually miss the dorm life and peace when I go back home for the summer but then again my roommates are pretty cool",

There are many posts about mason students who complain about this. 74% of students live off campus. So the parties and events are not happening on school grounds and are only happening if you know the right people. Compare this to vt or any other va college. They beat GMU in social life almost all the time. Their post is regarding social life. There\u2019s a reason 4+ people upvoted my comment",

No. But, there are more ways to socialize and have fun than to just drink and",

No.\n\nthats sorta the point. i also wouldnt call campus dead, but i wouldnt disagree when others say that. most schools at gmu's relative size have all that you described + the parties + more in the area, gmu is near dc but its not like most of the nightlife activity is because of gmu students. so really, saying that gmu is dead while comparing it to others schools is accurate",

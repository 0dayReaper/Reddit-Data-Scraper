Don\u2019t remember anything from that class though. What was Andy Yao\u2019s class structure like? I think I will just end up taking him over fall 2023 in person, im taking mis 310 online this semester and I really don\u2019t like it.",

If you decide to take that path then just know it requires a huge commitment and dedication to pass those classes in the summer because they will require a great amount of work to do well in the class. MIS 320 this semester was easy because Andy Yao literally opened the class in November and made it simple to understand what was expected. I had no issues with ACCT 303 but that\u2019s because I spent less times complaining about how difficult the class was and just studied. Not everything is going to be a walk in the park in life. These classes will\nhumble you and teach that you have to work hard to reach somewhere.",

Would you say ACC 303 was as difficult as FNAN 303? I am taking finance right now and I was so afraid of taking this class because of how much people complained about it, but it\u2019s not difficult to me because I put in the time and effort to study for the exams, and I understand the content. I\u2019m worried accounting is going to be more difficult to understand than finance is. Would you say taking OSCM, BUS 310, and ACC is doable? I am willing to put in the effort and time for these classes, but I don\u2019t wanna fail ACC because of its difficulty.",

He will open the class early and don\u2019t bother going in person he will literally tell students there\u2019s no reason to come in person when everything is online. The material is easy to understand. I would say ACCT 303 is less difficult than FNAN 303 but with the right preparation you will pass ACCT 303. I\u2019m glad you realize that FNAN 303 is a doable class once you realize all you have to do is put in effort. The people that complain are either lazy, want the easy way out, or didn\u2019t put any effort. If would do it like this. Take ACCT 303 in the first session of summer and OSCM 303 and BUS 310 in the second session if that\u2019s possible. OSCM 303 wasn\u2019t a difficult class it\u2019s just understanding the math that tricks up some students and BUS 310 wasn\u2019t bad if you understand how to use Excel.",

It's a decent amount of work, every class you'll go over a chapter of the textbook, but as long as you stay on top of your readings and do the homework you'll be fine. There was a longer research paper due near the end of that class close to the final, which was a bit difficult, but overall its not that difficult as long as you put the effort into staying on top of things.",

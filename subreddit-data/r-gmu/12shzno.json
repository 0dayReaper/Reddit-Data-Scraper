I am trying to help a kindergartner raise money for his school, there\u2019s a cute video I will try to attach as well with the link, it gives details about the fundraiser and also it helps the kid get to their goal too and help build leadership skills. He\u2019s currently selectively mute so this was tough for him to go out and ask but he\u2019s slowly working on it. This fundraiser will help build leadership and confidence and seeing his goal be reached will allow him to believe that his small steps towards his goal paid off and will help him succeed hopefully within personal life and being mute as well as with his education and building more confidence. If you could share this link, I\u2019d appreciate it. And if you\u2019re able to donate, even $1, that will make a difference for both him and his school! Both help and both are greatly appreciated. Thanks so much and hope you all have a blessed night!",

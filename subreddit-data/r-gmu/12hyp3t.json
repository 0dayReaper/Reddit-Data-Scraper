American University and George Mason University both cost about the same for me. I'm planning to major in biology on a pre-med track. Which school would have more resources and internship opportunities for a pre-med?",

Some folks even save on tuition *if* they become VA residents.",

Being in the city as opposed to the suburban hellscape that is Fairfax, VA is also a major plus.\n\nWhat absolutely sucks about AU, and I know you aren\u2019t really asking about this but it\u2019s important to consider, is the people. You may be able to avoid the worst of it because you won\u2019t have to run in any political science or international relations circles, but since 2/3rds of the students at AU study one or both of those things, you probably won\u2019t be able to avoid it. The school is full of manipulative people who will not give a shit about you beyond the degree to which you can help them further their career. If you can\u2019t handle that, go to Mason.\n\nI imagine similar internship opportunities will be available in either place. It\u2019s in the same metro area. As a social scientist who\u2019s never done bio or pre-med, I can\u2019t speak to resources. Those aside, if you only value being in the fast lane where all the action is happening and can stomach only superficial, unstable social connections, pick AU. If you have a soul, pick Mason.",

GMU is the largest public research university in VA. Not only will you get a great education, but you will save so much money on top of that. Please really consider GMU.",

You get the feeling of a college campus (traffic sucks around AU if youre driving anywhere) and i generally prefer suburban areas to major cities (more of a community vibe.) I have a lot of friends who majored in bio on a pre med track in mason, and they loved the professors and resources available to them. GMU in general serves its students incredibly well and I always felt supported and safe.  If youre unsure either way,  take a tour and see how u feel. I had to choose btwn mason and AU many years ago,  but i was studying poli-sci. Still stand by my decision,  no regrets, and l hope my kids choose to go there one day too.",

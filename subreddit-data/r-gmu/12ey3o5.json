    "postText": "So, apparently, someone in the Mason offices changed my English Courses and numbered them wrong. They did this on purpose, so I need to retake the same classes that I passed. I believe it\u2019s a money grab because there was no reason it should\u2019ve been like that and my own academic advisor agreed with me. They\u2019re conducting an investigation. I transferred from NOVA through the guaranteed admission and was disposed to have certain requirements waved. It originally was until now, where the same person that changed my English credits changed my guarantee waived requirements.",

I\u2019ve heard they fixed that processes in the last few years to address those complaints but clearly they still have issues, which is dumb cause the NOVA-Mason pipeline is a huge source of Mason\u2019s students and a big selling point for NOVA.",

I literally sat with one while he clicked in loops ending up on the same page over and over unable to figure out how to get to the information needed. I didn\u2019t have that much trouble figuring it out myself because I\u2019m very tech literate and used to shite web design, but it\u2019s a serious problem when the advisors are neither trained to use the matrix nor capable of navigating the web portal that accesses it. \n\nNow that was before they supposedly fixed it, so I assume it\u2019s a lot better now, but the point is that up until a few years ago Nova advisors were not trained to use the system and Mason for their part built a system too confusing for those advisors to figure out on their own. That doesn\u2019t set students up for a smooth experience and highlights an issue with the wider system that it was ever allowed to get that bad.",

If anything they would want to ensure the best education for you that lives up to the accreditation standards. \n\nI recommend talking to an academic advisor about your concerns. They will try to help. Don\u2019t assume that GMU is out to screw you over, they care about their students and want the best for you. Suing the university over some credits feels like an overreaction that would cost you way more than the credits are worth. \n\nIt\u2019ll be okay.",

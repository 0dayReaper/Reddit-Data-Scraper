            "comment": "After calc 3, all that's left is stat 344, linear algebra and discrete math, unless the curriculum has changed since I was a freshman. I believe they can all be taken concurrently. The difficulty of the classes really depends on how good you are at math and or how good of a student are you? \n\nSo if you think you are decent in math, or are an ideal student then you can honestly take all of them at the same time and it's not going to be too bad. Even if you aren't a good student, All three of those classes are an easy b with minimum effort. From my experience at least. \n\n\nBut I wouldn't recommend you load up on a math heavy semester. It's just not that fun unless you like math. Discreet and linear are probably pretty useful if you take them together. It's been a few years so I don't remember everything but I think there was some matrix manipulation and vector related stuff in discrete but later in the semester. So if you take both of the classes together you'll be good to go. \n\nAlthough if you want my advice, Don't take linear algebra over the summer. I found out the hard way that the shit that they skip over during the summer are actually very useful for future classes.",

They are now just requiring discrete to be taken with cs310. Thanks for the info. Are there any CS classes from 310 WW on up not recommended to take together? Was your advisor helpful in how to decide on the CS electives and the order of things? It\u2019s your last semester, right? I remember you\u2019ve been helpful for past CS questions. Appreciate it! :)",

But generally you're going to end up having to take multiple CS classes together anyway for senior year. \n\nI would say to take 471 before you take other senior level classes just because that's the class where most people struggle and if you're spending time between that other senior level classes, it's Just going to be a pain. \n\nI've never really gone to see if my advisor, I've never felt it to be necessary. I just followed the sample schedule as much as I could. But if you need to go see your advisor, you should they're there for a reason.",

I took it along CS 112 and Calc 1, and it helped me understand it better (I'm a math major, not CS). I'm taking 203 and 213 together along with 300 next semester. There aren't a lot of great options for professors, though. Discrete math should come first imo.",

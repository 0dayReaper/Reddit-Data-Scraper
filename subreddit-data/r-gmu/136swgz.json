    "postText": "i sent an application last january as an NVCC transfer student but i haven't heard back on a decision. i've been checking the application portal weekly and it still says \"under review.\" i thought they usually come back around april, so should i be concerned? \n\ni applied for guaranteed admissions originally but turns out i'm missing a class from nova and won't graduate until this august, i emailed the admissions office and they said it was cool and they'd just review my application as a regular transfer. maybe that's why it's taking a bit longer?",

It won\u2019t be hard just pick the easiest one you can get a good grade in is what I recommend. They\u2019ll still accept you don\u2019t worry, even if you aren\u2019t guaranteed admission as long as your gpa is higher than 2.8 and you did all your main General Ed\u2019s English, Science, History, Math your in.",

But i also applied to vt and uva. based on my wants and considering price differences, which should i go with if i\u2019m accepted to all three? \n\ngmu is in an ideal location for me. vt is a good school in general pretty much. and uva has more focused programs for the degrees i want. \n\n(just looking for a bit of insight, i know the ultimate decision is up to me. thx!) -i\u2019m not confident ab getting into the other two  but still-",

            "comment": "I\u2019d go with either UVA or GMU. UVA and GMU are well known for liberal arts programs. But if you get accepted to UVA I would go with them. The name alone on a resume will get you a job. VT isn\u2019t known for their liberal arts it\u2019s an Engineering school so if your not interested in Computer Science, Civil, Industrial, and Mechanical Engineering, etc your at a very big disadvantage. Make sure to pick whichever school offers a bigger financial aid package.",

    "postText": "Is it just me or is food theft getting worse this semester? Last week someone stole my order from Panera and yesterday my Chipolte order was taken. I don't have a lot of time for lunch so I usually order online and then walk to the JC to pick it up. \n\nMaybe people think it's a victimless crime because the restaurant will remake the order, but it's annoying as hell and drives up food prices for all of us.\n\nDon't steal people's food.

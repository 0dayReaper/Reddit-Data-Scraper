By the end of sophomore year my roommates were rowers, I was eating almost all my meals with rowers, and I was going to crew parties. We were pretty chill, and luckily had a house (might still) literally 2 blocks north of campus on University Dr. I lived there my senior year. Joining that club got me into and kept me in the best shape of my life, gave me a pretty wide circle of not just friends but academic resources through people, allowed me to travel to places I otherwise wouldn't have gone to, and ended up being the defining part of my college experience. We definitely didn't bleed green and gold, we were just a bunch of dudes and a few girls who liked torturing ourselves. I honestly don't know what I would've done without it. Joined a frat and been fat, drunk, and stupid I guess. \n\nThat particular club took a lot of time and dedication, and I voluntarily gave most of my free time to it. But it could be any club. At the time there were like 20 club sports you could choose at Mason, and you could have that experience with any of them. But it does take that initial effort to put yourself out there.",

For example, they changed the Information Technology degree twice while I was in that major, adding new requirements effective immediately regardless of catalog year. This added an extra year almost to my school career. They also increased tuition more than other schools. They sold names of buildings to businesses, like really? Eagle Bank Arena? Verizon Center? \n\nThey regularly closed off huge sections of the parking lot for a circus that had nothing to do with the student body, but instead made parking unbearable. Everything they did was money motivated and I almost never saw a decision that put the students first. Other schools actually care about their student body.",

Is there something we\u2019re losing?\n\nAs for the last statement, not at all, I know very much that there\u2019s problems with capitalism, but the thing is there\u2019s no \u201cperfect\u201d system and the pros to cons ratio of this one is better than the others. There\u2019s a reason why we have more technological, scientific, medical, you name it, advances than any other free country in the world, and all of these come from the private sector (capitalism!). There\u2019s a reason why Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, Apple, Google, Twitter, hell even the very platform we\u2019re having this discussion on right now, and pretty much any other major revolutionary company, all originated in the U.S. There\u2019s a reason why our top universities are more prestigious than those of other Western countries even though their top institutions have been around a lot longer. There\u2019s a reason we consistently make the most cutting-edge scientific discoveries and accomplishments. There\u2019s a reason why people from every other country come here for world-renown-expert medical treatment for rare diseases or when their doctors don\u2019t have any answers. And finally, there is a reason why people from all over the world want to immigrate to \u201cAmerica\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m neither white, even remotely wealthy, nor a natural-born American; I immigrated here with my family, leaving our relatively well-off life and coming here where we were essentially poor for the first decade plus, so to be clear this is not some patriotism-blinded view of the U.S. So that said, we have our fair share of problems like any other country, and constructively critiquing specifics of where you think capitalism or any aspects of the U.S. fall short, in order to improve it (as every engaged citizen should do), is one thing, but completely trashing it as a concept altogether (what you basically did about capitalism, and what many do regarding the U.S. as a whole) is another.",

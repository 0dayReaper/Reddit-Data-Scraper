    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI have a final exam this Thursday and in the class I have a 64 percent. In the syllabus it states there will be no curve and that a C- would be between a 70 and 71 and a regular C would be 72 to 77.\n\nThis is a class I need in my major (mathematics) to graduate next week. It's not a prerequisite for anything but I know I can't get a D in it as it won't count for credit in my major (this happened to me already as this is my second time taking the class)\n\nFor graduation and credit purposes would a C minus suffice or would I need to get and extra 2 percent to bump it to a regular C?\n\nIf anyone knows please let me know as I want to make sure I give all my finals adequate time to study still have 2 other finals to worry about\n\nThanks all",

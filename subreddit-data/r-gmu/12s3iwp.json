            "comment": "So as recommended, you can go for 530, 531, 583 but then you might want to take 580/584 in your first semester if you plan on doing any ML/AI related course and these two are the most common prerequisites. \n\nAbout the difficulty and misunderstanding of 584, honestly, I personally feel it\u2019s easier and more straightforward than 580. For most profs, you\u2019ll have 4-5 assignments, where for each you\u2019ll be given a dataset and you have to code a solution wise output file you have to submit on a uni website (Like a small scale Kaggle) except you have a small part of your assignment grade based on the rank. \n\nIf you\u2019ve spent any part of your undergrad tinkering with ML in python, understand the basics of numpy or Pandas and can code a pseudo code in python, you should sustain through the assignments. I\u2019m saying this, it\u2019s not that easy, but if you have a taste for challenge, you will enjoy it. \nThe theory covered in class should help you with the assignments and the exams. Overall the course sets the tone for other advanced ML courses. \n\nFrom what I understand, 580 gets more into AI with emphasis on algorithms and agents and environments while 584 is more data science oriented and teaches you more about how to use various techniques on data to predict stuff. \nAbout honor code, all I\u2019ll say is, keep your code as hush-hush as your income, and you\u2019ll be fine. I personally didn\u2019t need to copy code from anyone. I did discuss methodologies but my ego didn\u2019t let me get code for something I knew I could do myself. All I\u2019ll say be smart about whatever you do and with data mining, changing variable names is kinda dumb if you expect your graders to not see through it. \n\nAll the very best and welcome to GMU!",

How many subjects should we choose in the first semester...3 or 4...I know it might be stupid question.\nAlso regarding 584, I did study ML and AI in my undergrad but I would say it was more like an introduction to these topics. Same with python I understand the codes if presented to me but don't know the full syntax and may be a few important concepts by heart...what do you suggest?",

                            "comment": "Quite honestly, from what I gauge, 584 might not be the best option for you. I\u2019ve been coding in python since 2018 and am familiar with ML concepts since 2019 with internships and work ex on the same and yet 584 was a challenge. This is the most foolish thing I\u2019d say, If you\u2019re serious about learning go for it. The reason I say this is foolish is because I also once entered GMU wide eyed and ambitious about learning everything that comes my way. One semester later I want to get this over with in the easiest way possible, which includes taking courses you already know something about. \n\nMost Grad courses at GMU assume you have a CS background, are well versed with the fundamentals of CS and can code with intermediate to advanced level proficiency. With these assumptions in mind, the assignments and coursework are designed to challenge you further. Might sound intimidating but people who aren\u2019t cut out for it also slide right through it (with or without the best grades) \n\nIf your priority is good grades, make smart choices about your courses. For your first semester, take up courses which are core requirements like 530, 531 &amp;583. Once you\u2019re here, have had a good look at how things run and have established a network with people senior, get their opinion on the courses and professors you\u2019re about to choose next.",

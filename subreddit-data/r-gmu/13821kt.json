    "postText": "Hello folks! My name is Moe, I\u2019m a GMU alumni and current staff member at GMU. My current roommate is graduating this spring and will be moving out of our shared apartment, so I\u2019m looking for a new roommate. \nThe place is at Gainsborough Court Apartments, within Fairfax and 3.5 miles from the University. It\u2019s a 10 minute drive, and a 30 minute bus ride along the Gold CUE route. There\u2019s a Gold 1 and Gold 2 bus stop at the very entrance at the apartment complex, so it\u2019s easy to get transportation to and from the university. The complex is also a half mile from HMart and a mile away from the WalMart. \n\nThe apartment itself is a two bedroom one, I\u2019m looking to fill a 104 square foot bedroom. The bedroom is private, with a large window and a closet. The linen closet outside of the bedroom has been assigned as a second closet for this room. The apartment includes this room, my room, a shared bathroom, a kitchen, a living room, and a balcony. There is a  washer and dryer within the apartment, as well as a fridge, stove, dishwasher, microwave, sink/garbage disposal, shower/tub, and air conditioning. Utilities are not included in rent, but the two together range from $920 to $950 a month, a lower price range for the area. The bedroom is unfurnished, but I can help you furniture hunt if needed!\n\nAs I said, I\u2019m a GMU alumni and current staff member. I got a BFA from the school of art. I love plants/gardening, comics, listening to records, knitting, and making art of all kinds.\n\nMy current roommate is graduating, and will move out at the end of May. I\u2019m looking for a roommate to move in no later than June 1st, earlier is possible too. We would both be on the lease, and there\u2019s a $400 security deposit at move in. If you\u2019re interested, please DM me!",

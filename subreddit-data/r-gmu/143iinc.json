She kept changing the ACCT 361 syllabus without informing students. For example, a project was listed in the syllabus, but the syllabus didn\u2019t say how many points the project was worth. Kathleen eventually decided it was worth 12% of our grade. She updated the syllabus to say it was 12% of our grade, but she didn\u2019t tell us that she updated the syllabus.",

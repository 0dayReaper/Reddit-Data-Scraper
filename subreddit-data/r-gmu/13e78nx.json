I picked them up because they were wet and it was set to rain again. The police lost and found wouldn't take it, since they \"wouldn't be able to identify the owner\". So with that in mind, just describe the glasses (i.e. color) and that should be enough.   \n\nMore recently I found a lost item on one of the Starbucks tables. A white keychain-flashlight type thing. Just let me know the department/college printed on it.",

    "postText": "I'm currently a transfer from community college, so I'm a junior and I put in my request for a selective withdrawal for one of my classes. I was going to do a medical withdrawal, but I don't qualify. I was just wondering how long that takes on average to process? I don't have any holds on my account and I don't have any honor code violations as well.",

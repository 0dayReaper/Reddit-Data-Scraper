I\u2019m in the school of business so our event is May 20th. I was told by my advisor (not helpful) to just show up and give them my name? No other info was given lol",

            "comment": "As long as you register for graduation, you're good to go.   Since you'll finish in the summer, you select Summer as the semester of graduation and that gives you eligibility to walk in the Commencement as well as the Celebrations (individual College events).   \n\nThe last Celebration I attended, it was exactly as your advisor said.  Everyone lines up in regalia and you get to write your name down on a little card.  Then you are processed in, then you go up by major and hand your card to the announcer and walk across the stage to be recognized by your Chair/Dean.  You'll be in the program since you registered for graduation, but it'll have an \\* next to your name, denoting Summer completion.\n\nWeirdly enough, check out YouTube.  Most of the degree celebrations from last year are on YouTube with full videos, so you can see how it goes.",

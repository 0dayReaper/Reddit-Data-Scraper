            "comment": "Hi,\n\nI had MTH 322 (Advanced Linear Algebra a.k.a. proof-based Linear Algebra) and he's not everyone's cup of tea since, at least for me, the class structure was:\n\nNo homework, no quizzes, no attendance, but each test was worth 20 percent including the final so a total of 5 tests. Pretty much one test per chapter and then cumulative final exam.\n\nI know other math friends that have taken him for MTH 312 (Analytic Geometry) and they said it's the same format - no grades besides the 5 tests each worth 20 percent.\n\nMost math teachers will give a format of\n\n10 percent participation\n\n10 percent homework\n\nand then break down the rest for tests.\n\nSo if you're ok with this format and don't care for homework points then take him.\n\nHis tests also aren't the hardest in the world, basically if you go to class and you do the notes and the homework he provides you will be good. Yes, he provides homework exercises to do just doesn't collect or grade them.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions",

Please check out the #game-jam-team-formation channel on our Discord to find a team! At the end of the Game Jam, people are welcome to upload their games on our itch.io page. People are also welcome to sign up and vibe while they work on other school projects, such as the Senior Capstone project, GADIG assets, or other projects. We also allow people to submit non-game projects (ie. a song, dance,  digital art). It\u2019s a time to have fun, make new friends, and possibly even make a new portfolio piece!\n\nFeel free to reach out to officers if you need help forming teams or have any questions.\n\n***CHARITY STREAM INFO:***\n\nOfficers also put on a 24-hour Charity Stream during the Game Jam! GADIG partners with ExtraLife, an organization that donates yearly to children\u2019s hospitals across the nation. ExtraLife allows people to sign up to stream games while supporting a great cause. All stream donations will be directly donated to ExtraLife! Feel free to join us on Twitch to support us as well!\n\n&gt;***Links:***  \nOur Discord Server: [https://discord.com/invite/Ha5BGC4fCt](https://discord.com/invite/Ha5BGC4fCt)  \nOur Twitch: [https://www.twitch.tv/gadig\\_gmu/videos](https://www.twitch.tv/gadig_gmu/videos)  \nOur Itch.Io: [https://gadig.itch.io/](https://gadig.itch.io/)\n\nWe hope you will join us for this exciting event!\\~\n\n\\-*GADIG Officers* \ud83c\udfae",

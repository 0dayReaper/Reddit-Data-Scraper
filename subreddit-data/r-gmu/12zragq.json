Don\u2019t try and guy there during a busy time or late at night.\n- Akeno ?/10: TBH I\u2019ve never actually bought something from the actual counter. The prepackaged sushi is pretty good though\n- Flip Kitchen 0/10: Had it once, got food poisoning\n- Steak and Shake 8/10: decent cheap fast food. If you\u2019re in a rush this is the only one that will get you your food quickly. It\u2019s also the only burger place on campus (Manhattan pizza doesn\u2019t count)\n- Manhattan Pizza meh/10: it\u2019s not good, it\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s just an ok, if anything overly greasy, slice of pizza. Way too expensive. Go to blaze\n- Einstein bagels: has anyone actually ever gone here\n\nand thats my list, guaranteed to annoy at least someone.",

My thoughts:\n-Manhattan Pizza - Not great but the $6 lunch special with 2 sloces of pizza and a soda hits\n-Panda - Hit or miss\n-Halal Guys - I dislike halal guys in general with their bland ass food\n-Subway - Good, especially when using starship\n-Panera - Always messes up my starship order and is expensive for what you get\n-Steak and Shake - Decent for the price\n-Chipotle - Okay, but why were their drink machine down for like 2 months??",

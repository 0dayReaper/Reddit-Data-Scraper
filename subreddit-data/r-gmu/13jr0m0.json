    "postText": "Is it worth buying a parking pass for the summer? I\u2019m going to be on campus 4 days of the week (unfortunately) and I was wondering if it\u2019s worth paying for a permit or if I should find somewhere off campus to park. And if anyone knows any good parking spots off campus that\u2019d be nice to know as well.",

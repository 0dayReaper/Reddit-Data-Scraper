    "postText": "I am in my junior year of college and first year here at GMU, and I need to take my first concentration course this fall. However, I have no idea how or what concentration to choose. I have taken/gotten credit for all gateway courses, but none of them stood out to me. Any help or guidance in choosing a concentration? Honestly, all of the concentrations don't sound bad, but none of them particularly interest me.",

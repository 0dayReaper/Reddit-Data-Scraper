            "comment": "Andreani grades exams on work and procedure, not correct answer, which was very nice. Lots of partial credit for attempting a question. \n\nA lot of homework but that\u2019s necessary to get the material down, ours was online with a small quiz each section. \n\nPractice exams are incredibly similar to the actual tests. \n\nKeep in mind that 114 is a hard class regardless and you won\u2019t get around having to practice the concepts. Having said all that, I would definitely take him again if I had to take 114 again",

I had De la Pena for calc 3 and he was pretty good but calc 3 was easy compared to calc 2 so Im not sure I would\u2019ve wanted him for calc 2. He\u2019s pretty quiet and all he does is read from his notes.",

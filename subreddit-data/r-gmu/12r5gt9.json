    "postText": "I am creating a schedule to get rid of most of my base level courses and was wondering if I could get some input as to if this is doable?\nI know my question is subjective, but anything helps. As for the professors, I have Zhong for 310, Soltan for Linear, La Pena for Discrete, Maso for Krav Maga, and unknown for Physics 160. Also I am a CS Major for context.",

However, I think this would be doable if you don't have other commitments like a job. If you work or have another time consuming activity this isn't possible/your grade will suffer severely.",

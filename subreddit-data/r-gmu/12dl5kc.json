    "postText": "The GMU website says they are in the bookstore but as everything else on the GMU website they're full of S\\*\\*\\*. All the bookstore sells for graduation that I have found is the diploma frames.  I remember a site i visited through an official GMU email or something where they were selling caps and gowns, but the caps and gowns weren't out yet for sale so it was just a precursor. I also lost that website, whatever it was. \n\nGetting real frustrated, I am so happy I am graduating so I don't have to deal with their lack of consistency anymore.",

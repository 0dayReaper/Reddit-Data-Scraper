    "postText": "Hi everyone! I am seeking focus group participants, ages 21-40, for a marketing research class for tomorrow, Friday at 2pm. The focus group relates to social media and restaurants and will be conducted over zoom. It will take approx 30 to 40 minutes of your time. I know the notice is late but scheduling the group over spring break has been a trip. Please DM or comment below if you can help us out tomorrow!! \n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT: as noted in the comments this focus group is unpaid. We also have now moved it to 3pm on Sunday as Friday seems to be too last minute. Please feel free to DM if you can make that! Thank you!",

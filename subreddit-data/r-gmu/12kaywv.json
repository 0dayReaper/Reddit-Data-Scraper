    "postText": "I graduated with BS from GMU in May 2022 with a high GPA, I'm looking to get into Data Analytics Engineering.\n\nWanted to know what's the admission proceed like?\nWhen is a good time to apply in the program? For instance, in undergrad, if we get in Spring we have more options for better professors.\n\nIs it easier to do it online, or in-person? Too many exams or mainly project based?\nWhat are professors like? Is it manageable with a full-time job? \nCost is about $30k, I think\n\nFor background, I am familiar with SQL and Python. I've used SPSS in undergrad for project (but we had tutorials to follow up)\n\nAlso, didn't apply for FAFSA this year, not sure if I'll get the grant or no now...I got it for my undergrad though.\n\nAny insight and help is appreciated, thank you \ud83d\ude42",

DM if you want more details about the admission process, but at least for me, it's pretty much hit or miss in professors. All my classes have involved at least a project, you can expect quite a bit of SQL, R, and Python.",

I'm partial to AWS because of how developer oriented it is (pretty much everything can be done via API in a very straightforward way) and they have a great free-tier. You can create an account and utilize their [free-tier resources](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&amp;all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&amp;awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&amp;awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all) and event launch your first EC2 instance (virtual machine) to play around with. Also if you get on their mailing list, they often offer opportunities for free account credits (usually like $200-300 worth).  \n\nBeyond learning what individual service do and fundamentals. I would take a peak at some [DevOps and Infrastructure as a Code (IaC) concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/introduction-devops-aws/infrastructure-as-code.html). One of the most powerful points of utilizing cloud infrastructure is learning to manage it like you would software but this is just one thing I really push as kind of a cloud/DevOps zealot.",

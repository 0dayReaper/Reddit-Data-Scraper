                    "comment": "For some extra context OP-\n\nMath 113 is calculus 1. Math 123 is part 1 and 124 is part two, it's like taking calc 1 split in half across two semesters. My school didn't have AP courses so I'm not too sure what your math class was like so I'll break these two down for you:\n\nMath 123:\n- trig review (like the unit circle)\n- the limit definition of the derivative \n- limit rules \n- rules of logs and exponentials (and how to solve them) \n- basic derivative rules (power, product, quotient, chain)\n\nMath 124:\n-start with chain rule\n- logarithmic and implicit differentiation\n- arctrig derivatives\n- lhopitals rule\n- related rates\n- applications of the derivative (optimization, etc)\n- theorems (mean value, rolle's, fundamental theorem of calculus)\n- area between curves\n- anti derivatives and general integrals\n- u sub\n- exact intergrals (without the plus c)\n\nHow do i know this? I took 123 &amp; 124 And i was a Learning Assistant for both classes (I'll be an LA for 124 with prof Jauchen this fall!) I've worked with students in both classes from a lot different mathematical backgrounds, and it can really effect your standing in the class (though of course, with enough studying you can do just fine). \n\nSo what's my advice? Like i said, i don't really know where you're at since I've never touched an AP math course. It does sound like you've got your stuff together, though. If you're good with derivatives, take 124. I'd only suggest taking 123 if you really struggle with them and/or don't recognize any of the other topics i listed for the course. \n\n113 vs 124 is going to be a lot more work. It'll be a longer class and much faster paced because it'll have the content of 123 &amp; 124 all in one. All math classes can be a bit of work, so it's good to have a bit more time to let things sink in. \n\nGeneral Clarifications:\n\nTaking 123+124 is the Exact same course content as 113, just in two semesters instead of one. This option is for students who only pass 2/3 of the placement test.\n\n123+124 gives you the credit for 113. Testing into 124 gives you the credit for 113. 123 alone does Not give you the credit for 113. 124 is the second half of calc 1 and you have to actually finish calc 1 to get the credit. \n\nSince all of these options count as calc 1, they are all viable paths to get into calc 2 and beyond.\n\nDepending on your major, business calc may be better for you! It is much simpler (less complex math) and also taught by professor Jauchen. Talk to your advisor if your unsure what math is right for you. \n\nThe majority of calc 1 lectures, if not all, have 1 or 2 LA's in each section. LA is short for learning assistant. These are students who have already passed the course and now get paid to join you in vlass and answer questions and aid you through problems, along with holding their own office hours. I'm mentioning this just so you know you will always have in classroom support\n\nI've said a lot of words and i can't think of anymore so I'll leave it at this. Hopefully this helps!",

However, I have been here long enough to pick up on things here and there, and from what I know, there are a few resources that gmu gives out on what exactly to prepare for. These include things like Kahn academy and quizlets. Should be able to find it with a quick google search, or looking under the math placement test website. GOODLUCK!",

Just wanted to update you with the email I had gotten when I had emailed them about this. \n\nCould not add the email image, this is the response:\n\nHello,  \nIf you received a 3 on the AP exam, you don't need to take the placement test.  That score will give you credit for math 123.  You would be able to take math 113 or math 124 (the 2nd part of Calc. I).  Your request didn't tell me which class you were trying to enroll in.  If you are wanting to enroll in either of those courses, please email me a copy of your AP scores with your full name and I will be able to issue you the prereq override.  \nTake care and stay safe.  \nChristine",

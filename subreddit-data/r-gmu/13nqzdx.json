Since I\u2019m not from the area, does anyone know any good places to look into? It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be in the Fairfax area, it can be farther out since I\u2019ll have a vehicle. Thank you in advance!",

It has very reasonable prices for current college students and is designed for people trying to stay close to campus. https://www.facebook.com/groups/gmuoffcampushousing/?ref=share&amp;mibextid=jf9HGS I wish you look on your search!!",

I don\u2019t know what your budget is but Gables at Centerpointe is really nice, Ellipse at Fairfax, Fairchase, and the Moxley are really nice complexes. All of those apartments are within 15 minutes of the campus. \n\nContempo Nova is located in Alexandria and has some affordable studios but I\u2019ve heard the traffic is terrible. I hope  you are able to find a good apartment.",

            "comment": "I always recommend looking in the Fairlakes area to the west of Fairfax. The prices are much better (and the places are not as trashy as trillium) and it's only like a 15-20 minute drive depending on traffic.\n\nI got a one bedroom out here with a very chill landlord for $1500/mo. The same thing in the middle of Fairfax would go for closer to $2000/mo and you would probably have a property management company rather than a private landlord.\n\nIf you are open to a longer drive, I tend to notice that the lowest priced places are in/around either Manassas or Alexandria.",

It\u2019s perfectly fine to break it up into categories like Lectures, Assignments, Grades, etc., but there needs to be one place you can go to see *everything* so you don\u2019t spend 15 minutes searching every section for that one thing the instructor uploaded *somewhere*.\n\nBoth of these are incredibly basic, essential features that Blackboard has not offered for years.

Assignments were in course content, then the week, then the chapter, then the section, then on the last slide of that particular sections slide. So for one chapter yoh could have 7 sections and 7 different 4 slide powerpoints with questions in each of them. I manually stitched each slide together because there were too many variables and i could easily miss a question. Of course when you turn in a homework, everything has to be neat, in order, and easily gradeable. One of the many reasons I don't feel like this school gives a shit about me or students.",

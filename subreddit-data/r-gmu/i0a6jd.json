    "postText": "So as everyone is waiting for this supposed email from Kallaco for covid testing. My friends and I started looking into them, the more we look into this mystery company the more suspicious it looks. \nHere\u2019s what we have found, good and bad:\n\n- The domain for their website is only 40 days old.\n\n- Their [website](https://kalla.co) looks like it was made on squarespace in 30 minutes. There are grammar errors and it looks more like a template than anything.\n\n- Their partner company \u201cHealthECO\u201d only has 11 followers on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheHealthEco?s=21) and joined in March 2020. (Could be a new social media campaign or something) \n\n- HealthECO partner Jami Youmans, when her picture is reverse image searched it only shows up on one website and its a Society for Physician Entrepreneurs that you can simply pay $100 to join.\nHowever, Her [Linked in page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamiyoumans) checks out for HealthECO. \n\n- When we reverse searched some of the others pictured on their website. The results led us to 404 errors and dead websites. \n\n- Upon searching the CEO\u2019s name \u201cJohn Spivey, Kallaco\u201d we can go to their empty [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kallaco) profile where only 2 employees are listed and very little information is provided\n\n- There\u2019s a [video](http://Www.vimeo.com/user78424920) about Kallaco but posted 4 weeks ago, and the CEO\u2019s face is never shown.\n\n- At the end of the video he\u2019s showcasing, what is supposedly the Kallaco app but when opened it asks if he wants to allow StrataClear permissions and after that the app showed a login page for Kallaco. \n\nHowever, when searched on the the app store for either name, nothing comes up. \n\n- When searching for \u201cStrataClear\u201d the only results are covid testing by other companies.\n\n- I called the phone number provided on their linkedin and was greeted by a bot with the usual \u201cpress 1 to so and so\u201d but didn\u2019t go any further than the automated response.\n\n- the fact that, apparently, they can ship covid tests within 24 hours of you requesting it, and anywhere in the country, seems too good to be true. \n\n- The people who are partnered can be found on Linkedin and their pages check out with the info on Kallaco. \n\n- Their motto is apparently: \u201cThe people we care about the most, are the people who care the most about their people\u201d \n\n- VCU is apparently using Kallaco and people have been waiting weeks for their tests to even arrive. \n\nWhile this seems like a scam since we can\u2019t find anything informative or reliable about Kallaco, most of the partners listed are real and their info checks out, but there are still a ton of red flags. \nSeems like GMU selected the lowest bidding company for Covid testing, and Kallaco is either a 4 week old startup company that is way over ambitious. Or its just a scam and GMU bought it.\n\n\nIf it ends up not being a scam, realistically, I don\u2019t think the tests will arrive before the August 5th deadline. I would highly recommend going and getting a test done with your primary care physician or find a health clinic that offers them and can be covered by your insurance. GMU started this process way too late with a company that probably can\u2019t handle the high demand anyway. \n\nStay safe everyone and lets hope this doesn\u2019t turn into a crapshoot (this is GMU we\u2019re talking about so we all know the odds of that)\n\n\nTL;DR Kallaco is a 4 week old startup company that is really suspicious and possibly over ambitious. Or it\u2019s a scam. We\u2019ll have to wait and see.\n\n\n\nEdit: grammar",

Gonna email the shit out of the VA Department of Health, the Fairfax County Health Department, and probably GMU as well. I'll post any responses I get here.\n\nBig props for doing the initial research, I wouldn't have thought twice about this Kallaco company without it.",

They\u2019re basically data mining but with serious personal information like health insurance, Social Security Numbers, etc (if they ask for it.) A lot of people who are desperate to get a test are likely to go to these kinds of sites and spill their information, and they probably wouldn\u2019t think twice about it. It\u2019s really just like a phone scam. It makes me nervous for other schools and their faction and staff who will be just like VCU in the next coming months.",

In my case, mine went from negative to sample rejected. So now we have no idea if we're actually clear or not and might have just exposed each other and may be the start of an outbreak in Richmond.\n\nThis company is not to be trusted.

            "comment": "Hey there, just wanted to drop in to share what I know thus far.  I have twins heading to college as freshmen; 1 to VCU &amp; the other to GMU.  The test kit for the VCU kid was ordered Sat 7/25 and arrived in the evening via FedEx on Wed. 7/29. Test kit ordered for GMU kid on Tues 7/28 and waiting for arrival.  So, we **did** actually receive the kit as well, and hopefully, everything else (results) is legit. With that said, I wanted to just throw a few tips out there for those that may be confused by the terrible instructions enclosed with the kit. The test itself is an easy throat swab, be careful not to spill the liquid in the tube. Wash hands, swab the throat, stick it in the tube, break it off at the perforation (take the lid off the tube just prior to swabbing), put the lid on. Voila, that part's easy.  The slightly confusing part is the labeling as the directions are far from clear.  On the enclosed paper, there is a small sticker with the student's name and DOB preprinted. Write the date and time of swab on the lab request form **AND ON THE LITTLE STICKER**. (There is no blank for it, just write in on there)  You do **not** have to write on the label that is already on the tube!  You will remove the sticker (with name, DOB, time &amp; date) and **cover up the sticker already on the tube**.  I promise this is the way to do it even though the enclosed instructions really do suck and are unclear. I have been an RN for over 25 years and the process is pretty standard for any specimen labeling. I hope everyone gets their kits, gets negative results, and is able to venture off to college.  For all the Freshmen out there, may the force be with you.  You'll have had the most challenging HS senior year/summer/start of the college experience, I can't imagine how crazy this must be for you all.  Best of luck to everyone out there! Stay safe!",

            "comment": "It\u2019s a tracking app. Once you do the testing and download the app, your school can track exactly where you are and even set the system up to alert the dean (or whoever) that too many students are gathering together. So, if your school is adding this app to their conduct code requirement, you are, in all likelihood, giving the school permission to track your phone. Watch the sales video and it explains how students are tracked. If your school is chill and won\u2019t bring you up on conduct charges for being at a party that has too many students then no biggie. But, if your school is aggressive with policy, you should be aware of what this app is and can do with your info.\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/434498160",

(Read the full FDA email here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lJttIV6fDHUGRFm44-wIH85LGLWee1ei/view?link_id=0&amp;can_id=e27329b886928744f73825c77c92b8e3&amp;source=email-concerns-about-faulty-testing-of-students-at-mason&amp;email_referrer=email_899490&amp;email_subject=gmu-aaup-response-to-president-washington-re-kallaco-testing\n\nThe CDC has published guidelines for collecting COVID-19 samples. This CDC document explicitly states that oropharyngeal (OP) specimens (i.e., throat swabs) must be collected by healthcare providers to be acceptable. By contrast, the Kallaco-ThermoFisher test kit required students to perform an oropharyngeal (OP) specimen collection (throat swab) at home, in violation of CDC guidelines. For the full guidelines visit: https://bit.ly/3j59iYw\n\nOn August 17, 2020, the FDA released an advisory titled \u201cRisk of Inaccurate Results with ThermoFisher Scientific TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit\u201d (the now-infamous Kallaco test). This advisory was released to alert \u201cclinical laboratory staff and health care providers of a risk of false results with Thermo Fisher Scientific TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit.\u201d The full FDA advisory can be found here: https://bit.ly/2EnuKc9.",

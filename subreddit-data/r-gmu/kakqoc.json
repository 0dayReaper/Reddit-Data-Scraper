    "postText": "In fall 2012, I started at GMU as a 38-year-old, part-time student with aspirations of studying electrical engineering. I enrolled in one class - and dropped it after two weeks.\n\n(During our first meeting, my academic advisor said: \"Oh, you have a master's in computer science? You can start in the EE track wherever you want!\" ... which turned out to be absurdly wrong. I picked ECE 220, which has a prerequisite of ECE 201, which of course I hadn't taken. I was instantly in over my head. Not a great start.)\n\nI started again in spring 2013 the *right* way - taking ECE 201, and also Math 114 (Calculus II). (Academic advisor: \"You already have credit for Calculus II, why take it again?\" Answer: Because I took it *20 years ago* and didn't do well, and I think I need to *actually know* this stuff this time.) Much better start.\n\nMy first few years, I completed five classes per year (two fall/spring, one summer). Over time, the difficulty of the material increased; my career picked up steam; my family required more attention; and I ran out of summer classes that I could take for meaningful credit. My course load dropped to two classes a year, which was productive but painfully slow.\n\nI chipped away at a BSEE degree for *eight years*. This afternoon, I took my last final exam. I'm done.\n\n(I was admitted to the BSEE / MSEE program and completed some 500- and 600-level classes, but ultimately decided not to continue. I will still be learning - but plan to spend 2021 deep-diving into machine learning, including professional certifications.)\n\nA few memories:\n\n* I experienced both wonderful and terrible instructors. I met both talented and unmotivated classmates. I think that I learned something from all of them. Along the way, I developed friends in my classes, but all too briefly; they all cruised past me and graduated while I continued to plug away slowly.\n\n* I stressed about my grades, sometimes pretty seriously. I dropped classes when I could have muddled through and passed with B/C, simply because it was more important to me to *learn the actual material* than to get through it quickly. If I'd known how long and how strenuous the program would be, I wouldn't have started - but I'm glad I didn't, because I'm glad I did. Electrical engineering is a hell of a great topic.\n\n* I spent far too much time and money in the Northern Neck Starbucks. For the rest of my life, I will cherish the idea of a local 24/7 cafe.\n\n* After spending about five years choking down substandard and overpriced food from the (old) JC food court, I discovered Ike's, and then spent a bunch of late nights there with a textbook.\n\n* I served on the Honor Committee and tried my absolute best to be fair to students, as did all of the other committee members I met. (Want to avoid an honor code charge in CS classes? *Do your own work* and don't even look at Stack or Chegg in the context of your assignments. I cannot stress this enough: it's really that simple.)\n\n* I participated in SRCT - a wonderful organization - and donated a project (GMUCal) to help students create calendar entries for their classes.\n\n* I had a terrible experience with one of the lower-level ECE labs - only because the lab manual was, like, 15 pages *total* and a complete waste of time. (\"Build this circuit. Measure that voltage. The End.\") It was tragic because the class covered great material, but the lab was trivial and boring. I ended up writing a new lab manual for the class... which, hopefully, makes it a worthwhile experience.\n\n* Our senior design project was a student-led effort to create an infrared laser pointer to control a computing environment. I enjoyed functioning as part of a skilled engineering team - we had our ups and downs, and we put *way* too much time and money into it, but we succeeded and learned a lot. Easily the best experience of the ECE program.\n\n* Finishing the program with a year of COVID and distance learning has been disappointing, but... ultimately, not *that* different. The material is the same; the assignments and labs and projects and exams are the same; lectures are still 85 minutes long. I *loved* being able to watch the lectures on my own time, and the ability to pause and reverse and replay bits when needed. But I get that this model doesn't work for some people, and I missed the feeling of camaraderie with classmates. A word of advice: I don't think that GMU, or universities in general, will ever be \"normal\" in the pre-2020 sense again - distance learning is here to stay. Accepting it and learning to excel in that model will help you a great deal.\n\nIn total, GMU has been a great experience. I hope that everyone sets and achieves high academic goals and uses their academic training to advance the world, in whatever ways you can and want.\n\nGood luck to you all, Patriots. See you around.",

They are good and bad qualities of any school. \n\nI think it\u2019s all about how you spend your time and being able to realize that no matter what major you may be you may down the line do something entirely different or something similar. \n\nI graduate next semester and I am still thinking about what I want to do. I know how important it is to have something lined up but it\u2019s also good to have periods where I allow myself to take in a semester or experience. I\u2019m always interested in hearing from others at Mason and their experiences. Thank you :)",

You are an inspiration, and I mean that in complete sincerity. \n\nI've recently started back (at NoVa, with the intent to transfer into GMU in a couple of semesters) in Mech E, at 50 years old. \n\nCalc II was 31 years ago for me. If someone held a gun to my head and told me to differentiate something I would just reach over and pull the trigger for them. I've considered taking the classes again, but am trying Khan Academy to see if I can figure it out. The math courses terrify me a bit - and I got A's in Calc I/II back when it was still being taught by Newton (or maybe on a Newton).\n\nI just finished my first finals in almost 30 years - and I've aced my classes, but the idea of Dif Eq is lurking out there like a shark in dark waters.",

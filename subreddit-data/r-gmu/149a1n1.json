    "postText": " \n\n[Rate My Professor In Action](https://reddit.com/link/149a1n1/video/jvsdq2i9zz5b1/player)\n\nHello guys,\n\nMy name is **Jeong Min Cho**, and I am a former GMU student and a graduate. Also, I was the one who created the old Rate My GMU Professor extension - [Old Reddit Post Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/gmu/comments/p7g52t/i_made_a_rate_my_professors_chrome_extension_for/).\n\n[New Chrome Extension Download Link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rate-my-gmu-professors/baadmmacgcbifdhpcghklkcohafjddpc)\n\nSome of you guys have used my previous Rate My GMU Professor. It had been working solidly for a year and a half before it got stopped working. \n\nThere were **two** reasons that my extension got stopped working.\n\n1. **Rate My Professors CRUD API has been deprecated and moved on to GraphQL** \\- This broke my extension initially in early 2023. For non-computer science students, think of this change as Rate My Professors decided to use a different but efficient type of showing data. I knew this issue because some GMU students mailed me that my extension was no longer working, so I investigated the issue.\n2. **I did not update my extension to Manifest v3 from Manifest v2** \\- as a result, Google has taken down my extension from Chrome Store. Manifest is a type of extension template in that you will write down more details of your extension, such as title, description, permissions, and more.\n\nWell, I knew that both of them were coming and did not take any action because so many things were going on in my real life, and I did not feel like this was a priority thing to do. Eventually, I already graduated from GMU.\n\nAnd I thought someone would pick up this and create their own one, but I guess no one did.   \n**So, here I am.**\n\n**\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Used tech**\n\n1. Tailwindcss - [https://tailwindcss.com/](https://tailwindcss.com/)\n2. Webpack (Babel) - [https://babel.dev/](https://babel.dev/)\n3. HTML5\n4. CSS4\n\n**\ud83d\udcdc Features**\n\n1. \ud83d\udd28 **Complete Reworked** \\- the old version and this are essentially two different extensions.\n2. \ud83e\udded  **Lightweight** \\- only 214 kb\n3. \ud83d\udcf7 **Good looking** \\- replace the current instructor column to show a customized column.\n4. \ud83d\udce4 **Not burdening Rate My Professor server** \\- use caches and GQL query to fetch the professors' data efficiently.\n\n\ud83d\udd79\ufe0f **How to use**\n\n1. Download Rate My GMU Professors from Chrome Web Store\n2. Make sure Rate My GMU Professors are active.\n3. Go to the Patriot web page.\n4. Browse any classes.\n5. Now, the professor name column would be replaced with a new design with their rating in front of their name.\n6. You will be redirected to the professor\u2019s Rate My Professors web page if you click the score number.\n7. If you hover your mouse, you will be a popover showing the professor\u2019s name, department, overall score, would-take-again percentage, level of difficulty, and the total number of reviews.\n\n**\u2b50 Source Code (Github)** \n\n[https://github.com/Jeong-Min-Cho/Rate-My-GMU-Professors](https://github.com/Jeong-Min-Cho/Rate-My-GMU-Professors)\n\nStar it if possible!\n\n**\ud83d\udce7 Suggestions/Bug**\n\nIf you have any suggestions or found a bug, please send me an email to me!\n\n[jeongmincho@outlook.com](mailto:jeongmincho@outlook.com)",

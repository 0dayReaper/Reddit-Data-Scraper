    "postText": "just posting this to see if anyone has been in the same/similar situation regarding applying to GMU. Right out of high-school, I attended a local community college for 1 1/2 semesters. Halfway through the 2nd semester I left for the military kind of on a whim and didn\u2019t properly withdraw from the college I just stopped attending. (Stupid I know) technically my GPA at that college was a 0.6. I did decently well in high-school. This was ~7 years ago now and I\u2019m trying to get back to school after finishing with the army. I\u2019m just wondering if this is a 100% dealbreaker or not. I applied as a freshman and don\u2019t plan on claiming any of the classes I did pass at the community college for credit. I\u2019m also a disabled combat veteran and will be applying with the G.I bill, so I\u2019m not sure if that may help my case at all. Would love to hear anyones experiences with a similar situation. Or if you guys/gals believe my best bet may be to attend community college again for a while to improve my GPA. Thanks",

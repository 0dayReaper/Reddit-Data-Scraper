If you\u2019ve already enrolled, is she doing hybrid or fully in person? \n\nYou can also google a professors syllabus, I believe",

There was also a fully in person section but it didn't work with my schedule.\n\nWhat format she does isn't really that relevant, it's a standard biochem class so I doubt the semester structure and textbook will differ much if any.",

It's good to jump in during office hours for new professors to make face and get to know them. It will help you in all aspects of academia.",

It would be nice if everyone did like the math department and just posted every current section's syllabus on the department website.",

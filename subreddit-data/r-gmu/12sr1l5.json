    "postText": "By nature, I've never been a social person. Usually, I love my solitary lifestyle and wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nHowever, sometimes I absolutely hate myself for being an introvert.\n\nIn one of my classes, we have a project where we have to get 3 people to test a website and give us feedback.  We also have to screen-record their activity on the website with the audio(in case they give verbal feedback). We are not allowed to have other classmates as our participants.\n\nSince I'm unsocial and selective with who I let into my life, I have very few friends. But even then, I'm not super close to all of them. I don't have a good relationship with my family of origin(I'm on good terms with only one blood family member).  I have a significant other, but they are intimidated by the fact that it's recorded. Of the few friends I have, I feel like a burden asking them for such a huge favor, since we're not very close. It would be one thing if they only had to look at the site and give feedback, but the fact that I need to record them is deterring most people from wanting to do it. I interact with people at my two part-time jobs, but our relationships do not extend beyond work, so they're off-limits.\n\nI am fully aware that this is a me problem. I love having a small circle, but I also know that I lack basic social skills as an adult, and this is part of the reason I have so few people in my life.\n\nHowever, it's also annoying that we have an assignment where we need to find 3 people outside the class to do such a huge favor for us. Not everyone has people in their life that they are close enough to.\n\nUsually I celebrate the fact that my life is so peaceful. However, there are moments like this when I feel like an absolute moron for being an introvert.\n\nAt this point, I think I've definitely found one person, the second person is in question, and I'm struggling to find a third. I have to find three people by tonight. I've been looking for people for the past three days.\n\nEdit: I would like to thank everyone for being so kind and offering help! Thankfully I was able to find three people. :') I still appreciate the kindness of y'all though!!",

We all parted ways and barely keep in touch now. \n\nWelcome to the adult word. It\u2019s a bit tougher to make friends when you\u2019re not all forced to go to the same place everyday for 6 or so hours. You have to put in some effort to maintain relationships, and when you do you\u2019ll quickly see when the same effort isn\u2019t returned. It sucks, but it\u2019s something that everybody goes through. But I mean honestly it doesn\u2019t help that DC was rated [one of the loneliest cities](https://www.wusa9.com/amp/article/news/local/dc/washington-dc-named-loneliest-city-the-us-study-says/65-8304a1da-e605-4b92-8467-4b781e1a7bb5) in the country \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

In my first semester here, I met two guys in one of my classes who liked working out and everyday before I went to the gym, I would text one of them if he wanted to workout together but everyday he would come up with some excuse and eventually I got tired of asking. It sucks because I wanted to have at least some good memories in college but I guess not.",

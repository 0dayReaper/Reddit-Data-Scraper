I'm pretty good at programming and learning new things such as frameworks. etc. Would it be worth it to take these classes?  \n\n\nThe classes I need to take would take to complete the minor are:\n\n* CS 211\n* CS 310\n\nPick three of the following:\n\n* SWE 205\n* CS 321\n* SWE 419\n* CS 332\n* SWE 332\n* SWE 432\n* SWE 437\n* SWE 443",

            "comment": "Just going to point out here that SWE 419, SWE 332, and CS 332 are all the same class, usually called the first way. That being said I highly recommend that class, especially with Prof Amman. It's like an extension of 211 and goes deep into Java. Best part is there's no pesky projects, or even a midterm. Group based work with a small programming assignment each week.",

    "postText": "Heya, I\u2019m having a bit of a problem with my ASL professor this semester. It\u2019s a fully only synch class through zoom. On repeated occasion, my professor has removed me from the class and then marked me absent for the class. I\u2019m unable to rejoin as he won\u2019t let me back in. I\u2019ve tried emailing the professor about the issue, but I\u2019ve yet to get any kind of response. I\u2019m participating in the class and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being disruptive or anything like that, I\u2019m doing my best to be a model student so I have no idea why he\u2019s kicking me out. What should I do from here on out? I\u2019m really confused and frustrated as this class does grade on attendance and as of right now, my grade is screwed due because of the repeated \u201cabsences\u201d. Any advice is appreciated !",

            "comment": "The only thing I can think of is he's removing you because your zoom name doesn't match your full name from the class roster, one time I had a prof that threatened to boot people out if the name didn't match. That's literally the only reason I can remotely come up with, if you're not being disruptive then there is absolutely no good reason to kick you out/keep you from joining again. I'd say if that's not the issue, then go higher up like someone else said and go to maybe a department head or something. Good luck!!",

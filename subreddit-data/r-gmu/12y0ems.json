            "comment": "its not hard to switch majors, as long as youre not failing to the point of near/on academic warning or suspension\n\nbut id also wait until youve done a few classes before switching. you could find out that applied cs is better for you than cs, and at the very least both majors share a lot of core cs classes that you have plenty of time to decide, especially after taking your gen eds\n\ni know someone in geoinformatics (not the applied cs version but you still take the core classes) who really likes the program. theres alot applied cs could give you with their specifications since cs in general is getting super competitive.\n\nat the very least, you can wait until finishing one year at mason before changing. you'll take the exact same classes for either applied or regular cs in your first year so theres no reason to rush a change without getting more info in person. talk to your advisors &amp; professors or otherwise get involved to learn more",

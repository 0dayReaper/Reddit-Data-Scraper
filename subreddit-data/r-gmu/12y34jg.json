Is it more common here than other Virginia state schools like VCU, JMU, etc.?",

Your choices are usually praying you can get a seat in a course, getting a professor who is among the worst rated at GMU, realizing that you need to spend an extra semester or two because of prereqs, or choosing inconvenient times the department offers. Like seriously, why are all of the CS courses at the exact same times on same days?",

I wanted to do IT when I came here, but because most of the people at GMU choose IT, classes get filled up easily I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to graduate on time so I decided imma be a Government major instead  For me the main issue is graduating on time I don\u2019t want to stay an extra 1 or 2 years at Mason, I feel like the school does it on purpose to get more money from students.",

Usually there's a class with space left though.

If you're doing a popular major like CS though I can't recommend the honors college or BAM (although that'll only kick in as a junior) enough for priority registration.",

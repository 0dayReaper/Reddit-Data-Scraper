            "comment": "Your undergrad major doesn't matter for med school. It only that matters that you took the set of prereq classes along with your degree and did well in them, and ok in the rest of the degree. Med school admissions is just about checking boxes off a list.\n\nArguably, one should take the easiest possible major if they were trying to optimize for med school and nothing else, and focus extra energy on the prereq classes and extracurriculars. But you shouldn't do that, because most premeds change their minds about going to med school at the end of the day and go off to pursue other careers. Perfectly fine and normal, but you don't want to make a plan that only has plan B options you never wanted to take.\n\n\"Should I switch majors\" is a question only you can answer for yourself. If you like CS as a major keep going. If you want to do some other major... do it then. On a separate subject, majors that would actually contribute to you being a better doctor would be ones like Sociology, Philosophy, Social work, Public Health, stuff like that. Not any natural science major. You will learn all the science you need as part of the process.",

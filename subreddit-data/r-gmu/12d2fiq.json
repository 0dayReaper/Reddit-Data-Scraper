    "postText": "Quick context blurb - I'm an admitted student who will most likely be attending GMU in the fall (90-95% committed), and I am trying to plan ahead scheduling wise. Why is GMU's freshman move in so early compared to other schools? I mean, I'm excited to be starting college as the next guy, but practically starting mid-august compared to the majority of other schools starting towards the end of august is something I've never seen before.",

That's not \"so early\". it's also a week before everyone else for orientation, explore campus, figure out where your classes are, etc. It's also not required to move in a week early, you could do it 3 days before classes if you wished",

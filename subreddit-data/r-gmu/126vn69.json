The work is just a lot since it\u2019s on a 2 feet long drawing pad and then she wants sketch\u2019s on a smaller sketch book as well or she will deduct points. Other than that just showing up to class and doing the work will get you a passing grade. Since it\u2019s an online class each student shows what they did for the work and she talks about how you can fix it and that\u2019s it, boring class but definitely easy to pass.",

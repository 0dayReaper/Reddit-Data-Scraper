Is this adequate to study for the math placement exam? Also what happens if do really bad on the math placement exam but get a 4 or 5 on the calc ab exam? Can I still override?",

The algebra placement test will begin in 30 seconds. Sit up at the start. The math questions start slower and get harder every question after you hear the cry of another student. \\[cries\\] A single question should be completed each time you hear this sound. \\[cries\\] Remember to draw a straight line and calculate as long as possible. The second time you fail to compelte a question before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start. \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\njoking aside, the AP score should override. My 5 in ap calc put me in calc 2, granted this was a few years ago and the test has changed since then.",

I had strong foundations in Algebra and Precalculus but got a 2 on the Calc AB exam. The algebra sections felt easy, but I barely passed the transcendentals section, I got the exact score required at the time. \n\nFrom what I can tell, the new test is an adaptive test, so you can't go back to previous questions, you must get it right the first time. If it were me, I would study for it.",

I\u2019m not sure if they changed it this year but the transcendentals section is only required for students trying to enroll in MATH 113, CS 112, and above. Any other math classes below that (ex. MATH 108) does not require the transcendentals section. There should be a pdf of FAQs on the Mason site.",

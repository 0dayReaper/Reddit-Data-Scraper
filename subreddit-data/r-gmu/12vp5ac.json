    "postText": "TLDR: Please sign our petition in support of GMU custodians and their fight for better working conditions at George Mason University.\n\n[https://bit.ly/40m6ueQ](https://t.co/57LQSB5lmC?fbclid=IwAR0K31NDr5JSG0nhiaFwnME488l2aeQ4-iDDfAxMX93MiAGSKYd7Pw3O_lg)\n\nHere's the background: Mason's hard-working custodians have been trying to unionize and bargain for better wages and working conditions for three years, but Mason's contractors (who hold the university's cleaning contracts) have engaged in a pattern of worker intimidation, retaliation, and mistreatment to bust the union. Mason administrators are well aware of this record of union-busting and have done nothing to stop it. Meanwhile, workers have been subject to wage theft, slow-walking paychecks, and unlawful dismissal. If you find this unacceptable, as I do, please sign our petition!",

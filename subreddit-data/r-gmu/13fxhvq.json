    "postText": "I want to work on a custom gaming mouse project in the summer, would love to make a custom keyboard wrist rest too. I have a bunch of questions. Do grad students have access to the soldering and 3D printing equipment at mix? What are the requirements? Do I need a permit? What supplies do I need to provide? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I have intermediate soldering skills but haven't operated a 3D printer",

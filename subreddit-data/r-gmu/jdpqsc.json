I think a textbook would do a better job teaching this course. Also, in the lecture notes, the only important bits are the first paragraph of each section and the formula list at the end of the section. Everything in between is just a derivation of the formulas where he turns a complicated looking formula into a less complicated one but never says why the original formula was true in the first place.",

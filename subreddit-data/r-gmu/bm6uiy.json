We did get lucky that most of the construction was on the outskirts of campus for a few years (West Campus road, the new medical building) but campus has been consistently under construction for close to a decade if not longer. Before that was Fenwick construction which was just as ugly as it is now, and before that was Ike's and Taylor Hall. Before that was Exploratory, before that was all the other newish dorms and Merten Hall",

As for Microbio, it is very easy, and I recommend it with Brett if he is teaching. I heard the other professors arent bad also.",

Async course is great, A LOT of extra credit is given out and the assignments are free points. Exams are open browser on Honorlock. Also he seems like a nice guy, I just work during his meeting times so I never spoke to him.",

Genetics with Scherer was okay, a lot of material but doable as long as you stay focused. Can\u2019t speak for the lab portion though, I took it summer of 2020 so the lab was online",

    "postText": "I've been watching GMU dorm tours and they all show that there is only one bathroom per gender with two showers, sinks, and stalls. That doesn't seem like much compared to how many people I'd assume would be living on each floor. I'm still debating whether or not to live on campus so I was wondering if anyone with experience in dorm life could provide input.",

            "comment": "Very rarely gets crowded imo. The thing you have to remember is that everyone has such a broad range of diverse schedules in college, which even extends to night time (I know people who work overnights while attending college), so it\u2019s rare for everyone to even be on your floor at one time, much less needing to use the bathroom simultaneously",

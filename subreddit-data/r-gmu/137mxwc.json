A party that is openly racist, anti LGBTQ, Anti Union, pro tax cuts for the top 1%.\n\nA party that wants to make sure Trump is above the law, is for book banning, against separation of church and state, that is for making abortion a crime, cutting benefits from the people, anti gun control and consistently pushing to make sure voting becomes harder, especially for people who would vote democrat, and Gen z. \n\n\nEvery politician is going to be hated but the post 2015 Republican party has gone too far to just be considered just another political party. \n\nEven if Youngkin is somehow a \"good\" republican, a person that supports the current reputation party won't be met with anything less.",

CRT is a highly specialized grad school topic that the vast majority of people who got to grad school will never even hear about.

In general, Democrats and independents aren't as fanatical as Republicans, there are definitely some among us but most of us recognize politicians for what they are. You won't catch most of us caring about them or \"advertising\" for the democratic party, a lot of us despise the democrats and wish this 2 party system died out.

I just don\u2019t know what to do in regards to signing up for classes. I signed up for classes, and it looks like I\u2019m waitlisted for two classes. I\u2019m just stressed out lmao",

            "comment": "I would imagine there is a graduate coordinator that can help you find an advisor, though it may depend on which program you're joining (I only know how the college of science works)\n\nI would initially check the required courses for your grad program and start with those, maybe an elective if there is one offered that you are really interested in. If you are entering a research focused program, then you will want to check out which labs are doing what and reach out to the professor to see if they are taking on new students\n\nDon't be stressed, professors are knocking out finals and aren't thinking ahead right now, and you'll have plenty of time to stress once the Fall semester starts :p",

If not, I would assume there is someone with a similar position to hers for your program.",

It's something I've never done before and needed a model (someone camera friendly who thinks it might be fun as well) \n\nI was thinking of keeping it short, around 2 mins, lets go horizontal. \n\nHere's an inspiration: https://youtu.be/xBINp-EIzNk\n\nDefinitely don't wanna copy, more of an inspiration for the style. \n\n\nIf ur reading this n have a good suggestion for locations, i would appreciate it. I put graduation in the title, just in case someone wanted that style, which can also be done. \n\nThanks!",

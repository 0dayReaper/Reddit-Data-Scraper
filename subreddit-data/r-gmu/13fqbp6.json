I am looking right now at an MPH or a masters in something tech related?\n\nMy bachelors was fully paid for by a merit based scholarship and am looking for something similar for grad school. I am not likely to get any need based aid.",

If you stay at GMU your best bet is to land a GTA or GPA position, as those cover 6 credits of tuition per semester plus a stipend and health insurance.",

In some places it says that 101 is a pre-rec for 103, but in other places it says it can be taken concurrently. Would ya'll know if I can take them at the same time? Thanks.",

They recently split 101 and separated the lecture and lab for some reason (probably for people to take the lecture but not the lab I guess), but I think the general idea is to take both at the same time but it's not 100% necessary. I took 101 before they split it and I took 102 &amp; 104 the next semester (historical geology) at the same time :)",

My plan is basically to go to college and transition because \u201cfun\u201d parents. So since I\u2019m still deciding on what college I\u2019m going to I want to know if the identity learning community is worth it because that is one of the biggest factors for me to go to any specific college.\nBut anything that you can say about the queer acceptance on campus would be great.",

I\u2019m doing classes from late May to late July and was wondering if it\u2019s worth it to buy parking passes? Or is there somewhere else I can park for free/cheaper? Or shuttles? Thanks I\u2019m advance!",

            "comment": "At *lot* of this depends on what days/times you need to be on campus, and where you're commuting from. If you're in the city of Fairfax, [the CUE buses](https://www.fairfaxva.gov/government/public-works/transportation-division/cue-bus-system/cue-bus-map-and-schedule) are likely to be available. Possibly also the WMATA 29K. Way less likely is the Fairfax Connector 306.\n\n[GMU Shuttles](https://transportation.gmu.edu/shuttle-services/) are also a thing, though you'll want to check their days/hours and routes to be sure if they'll work for you. Note the lack of weekend service.\n\nCUE and GMU shuttles are free, WMATA and Fairfax Connector buses cost $2 (bring a smarttrip card, kiosks are available in various places, including most-every metro station).",

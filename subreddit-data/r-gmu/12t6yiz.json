I have Gail Drake, and she has given us a lot more guidance and advice than what I've heard from friends in any other class.\n\nShe gives us lots of feedback on each of the presentations we've done, as well as examples of previous team's presentations (not the whole thing, but its been very helpful).\nFrom what Ive heard from others, other professor's dont do any of this. And they also give you less time to do everything by making more random assignments in the start of the semester",

She really guided me through the project at crossroads, but never took full control or told me exactly what to do in terms of the technical aspect of our project. If you take the time and have a serious project, you can learn a lot. I currently use a lot of what I learned in those two semesters with her in my current role.",

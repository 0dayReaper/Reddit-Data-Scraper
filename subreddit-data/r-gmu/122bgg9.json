    "postText": "I could not believe my eyes when I saw so many students protesting against Governor Youngkins visit to the school for commencement. He is the governor like him or hate him, he is a part of history, he signs the funding bill for GMU, he is a integral part of the system that provides this school to everyone. To base your hatred and disdain for the man based on a couple policies that don\u2019t affect almost anyone seems childish and immature in general. I believe everyone should be able to have a voice, especially sitting governors of the state the school resides in.\n\nGovernor Wes Moore of Maryland is delivering commencement for UMD\u2019s graduation and people protested that too, the ridiculous nature of all of this is absurd. Democrat or Republican it doesn\u2019t matter who comes to commemorate an important event. I could understand general disdain for someone like Fmr. President Trump, but for Youngkin it seems ridiculous. The tribalism is ridiculous and I think anyone protesting should be ashamed and take a long look at why they view themselves as being so important to impact an event important to so many with a petty gripe.\n\n-M",

Calling people childish and immature for not liking someone's politics is odd though, considering that is how elections work and how people formulate opinions on people in government positions",

Calling others who don\u2019t like youngkin\u2019s policies immature and childish is um. very weird in my opinion. As somebody who\u2019s on the opposing side, I personally have a problem with youngkin speaking at gmu\u2019s graduation this spring 2023 because gmu prides itself on being an \u201cinclusive and diverse\u201d campus and then completely throws that out the window by inviting somebody who\u2019s making life harder for marginalized groups. I\u2019m entitled to my opinion just as much as you are, and you should learn to respect what others think instead of resorting to calling people \u201cimmature and childish.\u201d",

If this was a meeting of the College Republicans, or over in Mercatus, I imagine the response would be far different.",

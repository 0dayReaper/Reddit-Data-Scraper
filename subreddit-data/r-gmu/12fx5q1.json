    "postText": "So this is an odd question lmao BUT, I am currently a junior and non-stem major at a school in DC but I commute everyday from NoVA. \n\nI really want to get a comp sci degree and funnily enough I have enough credits in STEM that I did a while back to qualify for an associates. However, I don't really feel like going back to undergrad as I am already a non traditional student.\n\nI asked the CS depts at GMU and VT about a masters and both are open to a non-CS major with a CS Associates but only VT offers funding. \n\nAre there any CS masters students in here that got a full ride or any CS undergrads that got a full ride?\n\nFinances are a big deal to me so if a BS is fully funded i'll go for it but....I'd rather do a MS.",

As a MS student, you can be a GTA and have the cost of tuition covered.\n\n[https://cs.gmu.edu/employment-opportunities/graduate-teaching-assistantships/](https://cs.gmu.edu/employment-opportunities/graduate-teaching-assistantships/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is info for undergrad funding: [https://www.gmu.edu/financial-aid/types-aid](https://www.gmu.edu/financial-aid/types-aid)\n\nAnother way to pay for your education is the GI Bill. You have to do 36 months of active duty. It includes Coast Guard. It pays for total cost of state tuition plus gives you a small stipend each month.\n\nLastly, you can get funding through your employer if they are cool enough.\n\nCS PhDs are normally fully funded, btw.",

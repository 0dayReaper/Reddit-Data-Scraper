            "comment": "From a quick search on the Spirit Shop [here](https://gmu.spirit.bncollege.com/?query=nursing&amp;_ref=p-SRP:m-SEARCH) (it's done in a partnership with Barnes &amp; Nobles), I found the following 4 items:\n\n1. [Men's Green Crewneck Pullover Sweatshirt](https://gmu.spirit.bncollege.com/george-mason-patriots-mens-green-george-mason-patriots-nursing-name-drop-crewneck-pullover-sweatshirt/t-12287793+p-9350419200408+z-9-4186562592?_ref=p-SRP:m-GRID:i-r0c0:po-0)\n2. [Men's Gray Pullover Hoodie](https://gmu.spirit.bncollege.com/george-mason-patriots-mens-prosphere-gray-george-mason-patriots-nursing-name-drop-pullover-hoodie/t-34289993+p-4852149891081+z-9-866933437?_ref=p-SRP:m-GRID:i-r0c1:po-1)\n3. [Women's Green Pullover Hoodie](https://gmu.spirit.bncollege.com/george-mason-patriots-womens-green-george-mason-patriots-nursing-pullover-hoodie/t-23174437+p-8251446952581+z-9-886434220?_ref=p-SRP:m-GRID:i-r0c2:po-2)\n4. [Women's Green T-Shirt](https://gmu.spirit.bncollege.com/george-mason-patriots-womens-green-george-mason-patriots-nursing-t-shirt/t-34067759+p-6061532293808+z-9-162834504?_ref=p-SRP:m-GRID:i-r1c0:po-3)\n\nThey look kinda generic, but they get the job done. They're all Manufacturer Direct items, and they're on the pricier side, however. Definitely determine if you REALLY wanna spend $40-$70 on these (before factoring in stuff like tax, shipping, and so on). But yeah, here ya go!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for me, I don't own a shirt that states my major since the store didn't sell it (that and I wasn't sure of what Engineering Major I wanted to be at the time). Their generic T-Shirts are pretty comfy, however.\n\nGood luck with college, BTW! Be sure to get some internship / co-op experience as that helps with the interviewing process. Several \"entry level\" jobs say that you need 2 years of experience (kinda defeats the purpose of them being entry level), so having experience as an intern and/or a co-op student puts you ahead of the rest of the pack.",

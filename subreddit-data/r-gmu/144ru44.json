    "postText": "Hey guys,  \n\n\nI just recently accepted a Master's program with the biology department and have registered for my classes already. I've waited for a few days and my account balance for classes has not changed. In addition, when I visited the RAC center, they said my mason card was deactivated. Am I missing something? Do I have to get another mason card? What's going on in my account balance?  \n\n\nSorry for the trouble.",

Fall classes typically don't get posted to your Bill and Payment account until July/early August iirc. Sometimes, even later.\n\nThat's mostly because financial aid is not given until mid June and then they go through your account and apply the aid to your registered credits. Some people who apply for financial aid later are going to have to wait even longer for their bill to get posted.\n\nI'm assuming you already graduated from undergrad, had your degree conferred, and then applied for grad school; so as soon as you graduated they deactivated your Mason card and now you will have to get it reactivated again. But as soon as you get your card reactivated again you should be good to go.",

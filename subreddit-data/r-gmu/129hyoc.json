            "comment": "Based on my experience the work load is twice as much. In my opinion NVCC felt like high school in terms of work and assignment handouts. My tip is to have good time management and get work done as early as you can so if you have a project for example, you have extra time to work on it or go to office hours for additional help",

As for the other 2 classes im not sure as I haven't taken them. I don't believe Psych 100 is difficult, but I would think a 300 level accounting class might take a bit more time. Just use rate my professor and pick good professors and I don't think you'll be overwhelmed.",

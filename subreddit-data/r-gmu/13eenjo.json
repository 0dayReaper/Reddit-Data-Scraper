From what I remember, they just give you the data to do your lab reports on.... since I struggle with physics I just wasn't learning so it wasn't worth it. If I'm honest tho, in person wasn't a whole lot better but at least it was manageable. If I were in your shoes I think I would suck it up and do an early class",

To me, it was worth taking 3 lab sciences in one semester just because all of them were online. So I mean it when I say that online labs are the way to go. It would seem completely worth it to me to do it online.",

    "postText": "I have applied to George Mason\u2019s graduate school for accounting in the fall. Currently, I reside at JMU as an individualized studies major in HR and am graduating this semester, so essentially no accounting classes prior. I\u2019ve got a 4.0 GPA, made presidents list twice and have two recommendation letters from students who go to the school, but that\u2019s about it. Will they look down upon people who don\u2019t have prior accounting classes or just tell them to make up classes if they do get accepted? Thanks again!",

            "comment": "Usually the Masters Program is a shoe in, but I believe you need a bachelors in Accounting to qualify. A lot of people will be getting an accounting masters to fulfill the 150 credit requirement for the CPA exam, less so for the degree. The point of 150 credits is that you\u2019re well versed in accounting before the exam, so prior accounting experience (a bachelors degree) is required to enter the masters program. From the Gmu website: \u201cTo be eligible for the MS in Accounting (the full-time, part-time and accelerated accounting programs), you must have a bachelor's degree in accounting or equivalent from an accredited institution or have completed 27 college credits in accounting.\u201d",

    "postText": "Wondering if anyone knows what the actual passing grade for this course is. I had a B all semester then ate dirt on the final, it knocked me down to a D. I\u2019m worried I may have to retake the course, im an IT major, as far as i\u2019m aware the course should not be a pre-req for anything else. Thanks. I appreciate any guidance.",

You can confirm this with your advisor but I\u2019m 99% certain given the website says \u201cAt least eight credits must be unique to the minor and not applied toward any other major, minor, or concentration. Students must achieve a grade of C or better in each course that is applied toward the minor.\u201d",

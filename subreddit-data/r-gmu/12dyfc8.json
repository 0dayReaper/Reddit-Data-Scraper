            "comment": "I lived in what is now Masonvale apartments, but at the time was primarily graduate student housing, or you needed to be a graduate student to rent there - something like that. So that is different than what Mason is offering for graduate student housing now I believe, though I think grad students can still rent there, IDK its been about a decade.\n\nFor what I paid to rent there, it was a great option. I couldn't have found anything else nearby without paying more money or living in a dump. Being able to walk to campus was a huge benefit because as a grad student I needed to spend a lot of time in the library despite only having class 2-3 days a week. \n\nThe gyms on Mason are great and way cheaper than what you'll get off campus. Being able to walk to those and not have to deal with parking was a huge benefit to me. Living with other grad students is fun and made the experience more meaningful than just some apartment wherever I could afford - prob would have had to live in woodbridge or something. I parked on campus 0 times during my 2 years as a grad student but I heard from others that parking is miserable. \n\nIf you don't have classes on the fairfax campus Idk how the other campuses are, so. Fairfax's only drawback is that its not walking distance from the metro. There is a bus that runs to the station in vienna, but its not very convenient. \n\nLooking at the housing website for graduate student housing it looks like the two bedroom and even studio options are great deals. The average one bedroom in Fairfax is like 1900 right now or 23k a year, though a quick zillow search shows some studios around 1500 a month. \n\nCons - you could maybe save money living way out in woodbridge or possibly manassas (but then you'd have to commute and deal with parking all the time).\n\nIf you are older or have a family, a bunch of early 20s adults prob aren't who you want as neighbors.",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI recently appealed a citation, but when reviewing the appeal, I noticed that there is no photo of my permit, although I added one to the appeal. Am I not supposed to see the attachments, or did the photo not go through?  I appealed from my phone right when I got to my car and saw that little yellow envelope on my windshield.",

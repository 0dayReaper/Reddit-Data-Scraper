So I just wondering should I do the IT AS degree or should I go straight into GMU IT program, and not waste my time getting my IT associate degree. I just wanna know if all the classes transfer over or is it just maybe 1 or 2 classes that don\u2019t transfer to Gmu.",

            "comment": "I transferred from another school in the VCCS with an AS in IT, so effectively the same as NOVA. \n\nAll my credits transfered, however there weren't equivalents for all of them. So I graduated from Mason with like twice as many electives as I needed, and didn't get a chance to take any electives at Mason. Also there were several classes required for the IT degree or otherwise were prerequisites for classes that students at Mason take their freshman/junior year. In total this put me back a full semester. But with my extra electives, I just did a second concentration. \n\nAlso if you didn't get a 'B' or higher in ITE 115/119, you need to take a 1 credit bridge class to get credit for IT 104, required for the IT degree. Consider yourself lucky, when I went through the program they wouldn't even waive the bridge course requirement for students who got an 'A'. \n\nHere's the IST department transfer orientation slide deck, there may be some useful information in this for you: https://mymasonportal.gmu.edu/bbcswebdav/xid-251805650_1[https://mymasonportal.gmu.edu/bbcswebdav/xid-251805650_1](https://mymasonportal.gmu.edu/bbcswebdav/xid-251805650_1)\n\nEDIT: I read my own source more thoroughly. It turns out in order to transfer ITE 115/119 with a B at NOVA and the other classes on slide 10 of the linked PowerPoint, you need to be in the ADVANCE program. I am not specifically familiar with this program. You should talk to your advisor at NOVA about this program. I suspect that it will lock you in to transferring to Mason. Either way, if you aren't in this program and are trying to transfer according to the guide on slide 10, you will need to take a bridge course for each of these classes.\n\nEDIT 2: Here's the link\n[https://www.nvcc.edu/advance/](https://www.nvcc.edu/advance/)",

I would have to wait another semester. I looked into whether or not an AS is even necessary. In short, it doesn't. The IT field is mostly certification heavy anyway, so having just a BS and not an AS won't hurt you. Along with the BS, you will have to be certified though, depending on what you're going to be doing.",

And I just talked to a friend who told me IT program at GMU is so outdated and you basically have to teach yourself 89% of the material.  My friends literally used YouTube and UDemy to help them graduate. The professors weren\u2019t that much help. They recommend I do MIS instead and just do the IT certificates on the side.",

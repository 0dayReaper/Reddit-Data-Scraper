    "postText": "I do not like it when someone applies to handshake, and you are patiently waiting for a response from the person in charge of hiring others. They are supposed to message you if you got the job, and if not they are supposed to update you on handshake so that it says \u201crejected\u201d at least. The problem is, many of the people in charge of the handshake jobs just flat out ignore you and leaves you wondering if they even saw your application. Anyone else had the same issue?\n\nEdit: this is for gmu on campus jobs btw",

I never heard back from the large majority of them - like /u/Careless-Day1854 says use handshake to find company sites and apply to jobs directly on there. \n\nI didn't even get a job until a recruiter reached out to me on linkedin. Always reply to those.\n\nKeep in mind companies not getting back to you when they reject you is the norm nowadays.",

Personally, I find that's just how things are.",

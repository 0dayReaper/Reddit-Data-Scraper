    "postText": "I got a useless degree from GMU a couple of years ago. After GMU I went to get a java programming certificate from NOVA because the original degree I attempted to get from GMU had a weed out java programming class. Where 60 percent of the class failed. I have got sources on how I got to that number. \n\nI went to get the java programming certificate (from nova) because I thought java programming was really important it turns out not really. So now I have a useless bachelor degree and a useless java programming certificate. I have applied for over 2000 jobs and have gotten 1 job offer that's pays really low. I took that job and worked at it for 1.5 years never got a raise and still can't get a better job. It appears that experience from my full time job is also useless. \n\nI am a firm believer that college is a business that has to hurt more students than it helps to maintain profitability. I can't be the only one in this situation. Also I have no criminal record or disablity. This is a chance to share your story of how GMU did not work out.",

            "comment": "nah, it\u2019s all about how YOU network and view the usefulness of your degree. you thought a degree would automatically get you job but clearly you have been proven wrong and are struggling to get a job. \n\nIf you had been proactive during your undergrad, did internships in summer, fall or spring. then you would have potentially had a job lined up before you graduated. this is what i see often at GMU, students not looking for a job until after they graduate. Your prime time is during school. \n\nSince my junior year, I worked really hard to get internships, i worked while being a full time student every semester, so by the time it was the beginning of my senior year, recruiting season, my resume was well padded and I had real experience to talk about. even then, I still had to apply to 200-300 jobs and I was able to get an offer at end of my fall semester senior year. I am a MIS major btw. You have to WORK for it. students that have jobs lined up after school, busted their ass to get there. \n\nIt\u2019s more than just finishing a degree, while that\u2019s an accomplishment in itself, you need to do more than your homework to have a good job after graduating. GMU didn\u2019t fail you, you failed yourself. didn\u2019t matter what school you went to, seems like you didn\u2019t have a drive to do more than school.",

This is like the second or third post from you on this sub where all you do is shit on Mason because you suck and can't finish a degree or get a job. Your whole argument about hurting more students doesn't even make any sense. The only thing that loses them money is if you stop paying for classes because you dropped out. It therefore makes zero sense from a profitability stand point for them to fail you. The college ***wants*** to ensure that you don't fail enough classes to get kicked out. GMU does in fact do this through providing free mental health counseling, free tutoring, etc.\n\nAlso, none of that applies anyways since GMU is a state school which means THEY LITERALLY CAN'T MAKE PROFIT. There's a reason for profit schools like UoP are diploma mills.",

You can't blame GMU for your problems, I'm not trying to be rude but you need a reality check. You just seem like you wanna play the victim but can't admit your own wrongdoings, maybe you should have tried to really understand java(it's not impossible), and done some research on what skills employers are looking for(leetcode, internships, personal projects, the list goes on). MAYBE YOU ARENT QUALIFIED FOR THE JOBS YOU WANT. If you couldn't pass CS 211 why would a high paying job hire you? also I do not believe ***at all*** that you made an iOS app like you said in one of the replies because how were you able to do that but not pass cs 211.... and not be able to use those skills to find a job. To me, it looks like you tried CS until it got hard, switched degrees and now are trying to apply to jobs with high salary ranges for which you have 0 qualification besides the degree and a pulse. It doesn't seem like you did any research on building a strong resume and definitely doesn't seem like you were seeking experience in college (internships), or any way to keep advancing your skills. Too many people nowadays get a degree and expect to just be handed a job. 1 IN 2000, YOU ARE DEF THE ISSUE, APPLY TO JOBS YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO AND STOP COMPLAINING. It enraged me reading this because think about all the people who would die to be in your position and are never given a chance, do you know how lucky you are to have the ability to even GO TO COLLEGE!??? So many people don't get that and you wanna blame the degree because you don't know how to use it. If you want a handout just say so, it just seems like you have no determination, will-power or work ethic. Even if you fail that's perfectly fine, many people fail hundreds of times, but they get back up, learn from mistakes and keep going. But to me it looks like you fail and complain that it was too hard in the first place. Overall, sorry if I was rude but man, you have so much opportunity ahead of you and don't want to work at all to be able to leverage it and it's sad.  A degree is powerful, you just don't know how to use it. I hope you learn to become resilient and start working hard and doing things that aren't easy, just know that the hard path is the one with the greatest reward. You can be great, you have potential for it just like anyone else, but you just clearly are doing something wrong that you aren't including in the post, and blaming the world for your problems. **IT'S A CRUEL UNFAIR WORLD, NOTHING GOES THE WAY YOU WANT, GET USED TO IT, ADAPT AND OVERCOME, EVERYONE ELSE CAN DO IT SO YOU SHOULD TOO.** I hope this is a wake up call to you to turn your life around and stop looking for the easy way and expecting reward.

I found it to be more of a chore. \n\nI agree with the other commenter, YouTube is your best friend if you're struggling and are not good at reading documentation. I struggle with learning from textbooks so YouTube is just more friendly. \n\nBest way to survive though would be to just code more. I know that sounds like terrible advice, but the only way you get better at programming is to keep programming. Same with math, you can only get better if you keep practicing. \n\nIf you're still struggling a lot then you need to take advantage of office hours. I know it's difficult but the TAs and professors are there to help you succeed and understand the subject. They're literally paid to help you, take full advantage of them. Plus, I know that some professors are still a little sad that people don't take advantage of office hours.\n\nAnd probably the biggest advice that I can give that helped me out throughout the past 4 years, if you're frustrated and can't figure something out, go to a different location. Before my senior year, I had never actually gone to office hours.\n\nLet me explain. Before this year, There have been 3 times where I struggled enough that I actually needed to see the professor. When that happened, I went to the office hours 30 minutes before they started, sat down and started working on the problem. And I had figured out a solution before the professor's doors were even open. Sometimes all you need is a change of location to get your brain working. It might sound stupid but it works for some people. \n\n\nAlso another stupid piece of advice, if you're like me, and your brain works the most when you're taking a shit, showering or trying to sleep. If you figure something out while you're laying down on your bed trying to sleep, Write a little note to yourself about what you figured out and to work that out when you wake up. That has saved my life more times than I can count.",

As someone who switched from a non-stem major, and struggled with 112 at first, just remember YouTube is your best friend. Any concept at all, make sure you understand all of them. It will build a strong foundation for understanding cs later on (and for me it did get better). Don\u2019t get discouraged by these other answers and remember there\u2019s always numerous resources available for you to take advantage of.  If you want to discuss more, feel free to dm me!",

There also YouTube videos to help guide you in the way. \n\nIt\u2019s a bit late in the semester so I\u2019m not sure how much help this would be but if you still wanna do something coding  related I\u2019d switch to IT. Classes are much slower and give you time to adjust if you\u2019ve never coded before.",

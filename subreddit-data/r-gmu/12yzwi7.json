    "postText": "Sorry if this doesn't fit this sub reddit its my first time posting. This summer I'm taking three classes (10 credits) during the A session. They are all asynchronous. I'm taking PSYC 100, INTS 210, IT 104 and its lab. I'm wondering if this is too big of a course load. This is my first time taking summer classes at GMU so I don't really know what to expect. I ended up taking a gap semester so this spring semester is my first one here and I'm trying to catch up. That being said I don't want to burn out and loose money over this. If I was going to drop any of these it would be the IT class and its lab. I appreciate any advise, thanks.",

If you don't get confused by the usage of html, excel, and other office's you should be relatively fine. \n\nPSYC 100 professors are usually really considerate and don't put much work load. though it does entail a lot of memorization but again most professors are really nice so it's usually open book exams/quizzes so i wouldn't worry about this class either.",

Summer classes are, essentially, entire semester-long classes compressed down into just a couple of weeks. Same work load, generally speaking.\n\nTl;dr:\nYou should be fine if you stay on top of your work load. Let deadlines slide and thinga very quickly pile up.",

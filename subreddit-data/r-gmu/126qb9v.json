It was a small class so we would joke with them \"You should be plenty used to public speaking now.\"\n\nFlorian was in larger COMM lecture class, I can't remember what it was exactly (250? 350?). But you had to break into groups for lab type projects. He was in the neighboring group and it seemed like everyone had fun.",

I sent emails to the admissions office, but if there\u2019s anything I can do to remedy the situation today would be appreciated. I received my admission notice on Wednesday.",

The reset password part of the site was broken when I was doing that too. I can send/link to pictures of my acceptance email/the steps. \nThe survey it told me to fill out tells me the transaction was submitted, but not processed. That was in the letter. The non degree admission site told me to accept the admission. I can\u2019t find that step on the portal. Am I missing it? I can send pictures.",

I didn\u2019t think I turned in the acceptance with the deposit, but I guess I was on the buss when it happened and I must\u2019ve missed that part. Anyway, I\u2019ve been moving apartments and finishing exams this week and didn\u2019t realize that the account that previously hadn\u2019t worked, was now working. Sorry for the panicked post. I appreciate the responses",

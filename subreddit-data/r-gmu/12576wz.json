I have seen cases where they can be sent to the student first, but these are not as common. \n\nI'm pretty sure that when I initially applied to GMU for grad school, the letters of recommendation were not sent to me. It's not impossible that things have changed since then or that this student is in a different situation, but it's probably something that should be double checked with admissions.",

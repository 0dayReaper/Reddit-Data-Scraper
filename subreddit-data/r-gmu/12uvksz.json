    "postText": "I\u2019m wondering if any fellow nursing students who have taken this can give some insight in my first clinical.\n\nI basically know very little, it seems like the program isn\u2019t giving us students much information about this. Could anyone who\u2019s taken it share what exactly goes on? Where it\u2019s located or how difficult it is? Do we wear scrubs and everything? Would you recommend taking clinicals in the first half of the semester or second? Thank you in advance~",

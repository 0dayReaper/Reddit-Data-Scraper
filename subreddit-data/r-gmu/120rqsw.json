He\u2019s trying to pull the same stunt he did to win the gubernatorial race: find a conveniently-timed controversy and ride the wave. \n\nYoungkin WANTS people to rage and yell and \u201cthreaten\u201d his freedom of speech. It\u2019s like the anti-abortion cults that stand in Wilkins Plaza, who want you to argue and fight them so they can record, take out of context, and prove that the \u201csnowflake liberals\u201d are wrong. Youngkin will do the same, so he looks like the victim of \u201cwoke liberal college students\u201d, which will make a large voter base sympathetic to him and give him some inspiration for some bad legislation that \u201ctake critical race theory out of higher ed\u201d or some other word-salad conservative nonsense, which will give him a better chance of a successful presidential run. \n\nThe best thing you can do, like you said, is just not show up. Commencement is long and boring anyways, and I don\u2019t even think the PhDs are getting the usual recognition this year anyways, so what\u2019s the point? Go to your college ceremonies and ignore Youngkin like he\u2019s a toddler throwing a temper tantrum. Low turnout at a commencement speech not a compelling platform for a presidential campaign: being \u201csilenced\u201d by \u201cthe libs\u201d is.",

He is giving a shit ton of money of state funding to grants and the school, which we all need and would like. \n\nI personally can't do anything, and neither can any other student, especially grouped together. No great amount of petition signatures will get the results that some wish for. If you don't want to attend his speech, that's okay, I won't either because I've got other things I need to do such as get a degree, live, and take care of those that mean something to me. Youngkin, however, has every constitutional right to stand on stage and speak, just like many of us have every constitutional right to say what we want about Youngkin. Attend if you like him, don't attend if you don't like him.\n\nThis is my unbiased answer...",

Masonites should be humbled and let history judge Youngkin while other schools envy GMU. Way better than our speaker who I don't even remember (2000 anyone?).

Do we just \"accept\" other people with mental health issues or do we try and get them help? If we treated other mental health issues the same way we treat gender dysmorphia, well - it wouldn't work out too well, would it?\n\nHow about this - find studies that are not in favor of transgenderism? It will be quite hard, especially to find anything new, and you should ask yourself why that is. I know about studies, how they're done, funded an ultimately published. I know this because I am an actual scientist who has to read dozens of studies a month. The research won't mean anything until all research given equal opportunity to be peer reviewed and published. The current environment now does not allow for anything other than the agreed and accepted conclusion - anything else, and you're a hateful bigot, regardless of what the science actually says, and no journal will publish anything to the contrary.\n\nFor my part, I'm just eating popcorn and watching gleefully as everything burns down around me at this point.",

Protesting having him speak doesn\u2019t change his views, doesn\u2019t change peoples views who support him, doesn\u2019t change anything but it make those who did the protesting feel an (empty) sense of moral superiority. I really hate this trend of not even being able to hear opposing viewpoints or even just be around people you might not be totally aligned with. It builds weak moral fortitude, character, and resilience. There\u2019s a whole big world out there and you can\u2019t just shut out what you don\u2019t like. Glad the other other comments are generally similar-ish here, makes me have hope for the world lol.",

I wouldn't have any issue with Youngkin coming to campus as a guest speaker in general, but being named Commencement speaker is an honor, and should be someone who can address the ENTIRE graduating class in a way that is inspirational or hopeful or whatever. Selecting Youngkin is a slap in the face to all those members of the Mason community that are targeted by his bigotry, and it's a shame.",

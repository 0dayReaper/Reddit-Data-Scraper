Are sales reopening?? \nInfo says students can reserve up to NINE tickets, why did they not calculate if that number was viable prior to opening tickets sales? Idk what to do.",

To be honest with you, many students only go to their schools ceremony because they want to walk and hear their name. Plus many aren\u2019t showing up to the big ceremony because of a certain commence speaker",

Im an art student and they\u2019re making our ceremony in the performing arts building and only allowing us 5 tickets and they keep emailing us because we\u2019re not returning any of them for other families. Maybe they should have put us in Eaglebank like the rest of the schools.\nGMU sucks sometimes",

I think they should've driven home the fact that you MIGHT need tickets even stronger than they did, which was kinda in passing.",

I graduated last year and when I heard that\u2019s what they were doing I didn\u2019t even go. I just spent that day with family and relatives having our own graduation party. I did attend my buddies graduation at the university of Maryland and wow that was amazing. Everybody got to walk the stage and was recognized. And there was not BS ticket system either. I\u2019m just happy I\u2019m done with mason and it\u2019s BS.  Anyways congrats on your accomplishments and I wish you the best.",

Because we\u2019re in presidents park we don\u2019t have control over the ac and heat, the school transitions this area from heat to ac in march and they don\u2019t change it again up until the fall. \n\nSadly there\u2019s no way of changing it, but it\u2019s better to endure this temporarily than have heat in warmer month (it\u2019s an abnormally cold yr, whcih is why we\u2019re no cold, usually it\u2019s much warmer in march). The best way to endure it is to bundle up. So if you have sheets, blankets, comforters, cloths, etc\u2026 that trap in the heat i reccomend you use them. additionally, until it\u2019s warmer outside it may be beneficial to keep ur door open (when ur in it and awake) to the hallway(if it\u2019s warmer then ur room) and find ways in which you can trap the heat in ur dorm",

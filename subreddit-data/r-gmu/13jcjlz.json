    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nNow that finals are over, how are everybody's (healthy) methods for coping with stress?\n\nI just finished a few finals and I'm pretty sure I'm failing a few courses/tests, and I'm very laughably failing to manage my stress levels.\n\nI think the thing I'm most stressed about is that I could've done very well on this particular final, but I had to sacrifice study time for far more important classes and assignments due around finals week, and by the time I was done with most other finals, I was already burnt out.\n\nUpdate: Thank you everyone for all the kind words of advice, just got my final grades back and I'M PASSING ALL MY CLASSES! I tried some suggestions and they were extraordinarily helpful for my stress. I cannot express in words how much anxiety I was going through waiting for those exam scores. Thank you so much everybody, you guys are the best. Have a great summer!",

I'll go to the gym, workout, go for a walk, etc. Also don't sink into the temptation to eat like trash by saying \"oh I'm stressed, I deserve this.\" (Well in moderation it's obviously ok lol) I've found that the worse I eat, the worse I feel, and the less productive I am. ETA: oh and music! Find a playlist, put those headphones on, and settle down to jam out while I'm working on something. I need some kind of white noise, and I'm too distracted by having a YouTube video on, so music works great for me personally",

Totally agree with the music, I personally like taking a bath while listening to some jazz. Might not be relevant to you, but hey whats one more method, right?",

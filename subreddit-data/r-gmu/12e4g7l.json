    "postText": "Hey there! I recently graduated from GMU, and I am looking for a roommate or 2 to split an apartment with. The areas I'm looking in are Centreville, Chantilly, fair lakes, parts of Fairfax. Is anyone, former graduate or current student, looking to get an apartment? Lmk if you're interested. If so, we can chat and get to know each other beforehand to see if it would be a good fit. My current lease ends at the end of June.",

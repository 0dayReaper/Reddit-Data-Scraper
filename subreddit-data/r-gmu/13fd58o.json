In that much time, UPS will likely have *delivered* it... \n\nThat is, if it's truly been shipped. A lot sketchy folks generate their shipping details before the product has actually been delivered to, or picked up by, the shipper.",

They said the company is overwhelmed but their rep there told them that they\u2019re shipping everything by Monday night and they\u2019re doing overnight shipping, so we should be good.",

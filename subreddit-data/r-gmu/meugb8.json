    "postText": "There was a press release given on Friday where GMU Police Officers are suing GMU for a culture of police corruption. It says that GMU officers tried to report wrongdoing, but instead of a proper investigation, the reporting officers got punished. \n\nLink to PDF here: [http://www.fairfaxunderground.com/forum/file.php?2,file=449099,filename=PRESS\\_RELEASE\\_-\\_03.26.2021.pdf](http://www.fairfaxunderground.com/forum/file.php?2,file=449099,filename=PRESS_RELEASE_-_03.26.2021.pdf) \n\nFull text below: \n\n March 26, 2021 \n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE \n\nMedia Contact: J. Caleb Jones, Esq.   \n703-771-4671   \njcjones@simmsshowerslaw.com \n\nGMU OFFICERS FILE COMPLAINT ALLEGING PATTERN AND PRACTICE OF POLICE CORRUPTION AT GMU, SEEKING $5,620,000 Case No. 2021-03914 \n\nOn March 15, 2021, two George Mason University (GMU) police officers filed a suit in Fairfax Circuit Court alleging a pattern and practice of police corruption at GMU. The officers\u2019 complaint alleges retaliation for reporting a use of excessive force by a GMU police officer against a handcuffed arrestee, who was taken into custody for a non-violent offense on January 28, 2018, at the EagleBank Arena on the Fairfax GMU campus. \n\nIn addition to the excessive force, the two officers noted their suspicion that the official written police report of the incident contained deliberately fabricated facts, designed to place blame on the arrestee for the force used and cover up the actions of the officer by describing violence of the arrestee against officers, which the body-worn camera video does not corroborate. Counsel for the officers has been able to contact the arrestee, who has confirmed in a sworn affidavit that the facts in the police report describing his attempts to \u201ckick, bite, and strike officers\u201d are not true, even during the short moments when the officer\u2019s body-worn camera does not directly capture the arrestee and the officer. \n\nThe use of excessive force was captured on the body-worn camera of an officer at a time when the body-worn camera system was first being introduced at GMU. As such, most GMU police officers did not know that their actions were regularly being recorded. \n\nAs a result of the plaintiffs\u2019 attempts to have these allegations of excessive force and false police report properly investigated, GMU has removed the plaintiffs from job duties, demoted or transferred them, and even defamed an officer before the Fairfax County Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, claiming that he was found to be guilty of dishonesty in his role at the department. The officers\u2019 complaint alleges that multiple departments and senior administrators at GMU, up to and including the Office of the President, participated in the cover-up, punishment, and retaliation of the two officers who reported this matter in good faith. Sworn testimony already taken from some defendants supports many of these claims. \n\nIn contrast to the treatment of the reporting officers, the officer who was allegedly recorded using excessive force has since been promoted twice; this officer now holds a significant supervisory  position in the department. At the time of the incident in the video, presently known information seems to suggest this officer reported directly to the GMU Chief of Police. He now directly reports to one of the co-defendants involved in the retaliation of the plaintiffs. \n\nThe plaintiffs have attempted to correct these wrongful actions through ordinary channels, to no avail. One plaintiff was not able to successfully challenge his discipline through the Virginia State Office of Equal Employment and Dispute Resolution (EEDR). In his matter, the hearing officer did not allow the video of the incident to be included as evidence. The other plaintiff was able to successfully challenge his discipline before the EEDR on the same set of facts. In his matter, the hearing officer did allow the video of the incident to be included as evidence. \n\nDespite limited relief \u2013 receiving an order from a state official for GMU to return the officer\u2019s previous job duties to him \u2013 GMU has refused to return this officer to his previous position. Due to the impossibility of finding relief through ordinary internal channels, the officers have filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, through their attorneys at Simms Showers, LLP, in Leesburg, Virginia. Their complaint seeks to enforce the order of the hearing officer of the EEDR, and seeks equitable relief and monetary damages for whistleblower retaliation, conspiracy to obstruct justice, defamation, conspiracy to defame, fraud, conspiracy to defraud, and breach of contract. Plaintiffs have alleged total damages of $5,620,000. \n\nBecause GMU has strenuously fought against both a proper investigation of this matter, and strenuously fought to keep the undisputed facts from public view, the plaintiffs, through their counsel, deliver this press release so that both this matter and the continuing pattern of police corruption at GMU receive the appropriate light of public scrutiny.",

In other news, water is wet. This is what ACAB means. Even in a more \"diverse,\" \"progressive\" place (GMU is conservative for a university, but relative to 90% of the outside world we're far left), good cops are forced to protect bad ones or get pushed out. These officers tried to \"reform from the inside,\" and the inevitable result is that they're now on the outside and nothing changed. How much do you wanna bet GMU will just pay the verdict, raise the price of something on campus to make us pay for it, and keep the police as-is? But you can't have a BLM, fist, or ACAB mask at school-related functions because it's a political statement. Well, so is running the entire fucking Mercatus Center.",

However, the issues are complex. The officer whose name was on the report was making his first arrest of his career. That officer actually complained to his superior about the excessive force at the time, and that complaint went nowhere (paragraph 98 of the Complaint). That report was required to be approved by his supervisor to a greater extent than a normal officer, and for these reasons, we do not know who actually wrote these false statements, which is why we are not releasing the names of the other officers in question. We do not know if pressure was placed on the officer, if another superior officer added the false statements under his name, or if this officer incorrectly took the word of other officers and recorded them as his own observations, which allowed the other GMU PD officers and administrators to take advantage of a genuine mistake. It's all in play, and we really don't know what's going on. Only through discovery and depositions will we (possibly) find out.",

There is a big problem of corruption at GMU, and it is a danger to GMU officers, GMU students, and the public at large. (Trust me. I know. This is not my only case involving GMU.) The only way this is going to get better is if EVERYONE (GMU administrators, GMU Police, and GMU Students) starts to act in the way they SHOULD act. So start doing that now, at every moment of every day, including how you react to reading this stuff. \n\nThat's going to be very hard to know how to do that, but it is like the good book says: \n\n&gt;\"Check it out: I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. (Matthew 10:16, modified by my own translation)\" \n\nIt is very difficult when someone is \"in the midst of wolves\" to be \"wise as serpents and innocent as doves,\" and no one is perfect. That's why I feel for my \"defendant\" clients just as much as I do for my \"plaintiff\" clients. Also, it is worth remembering that \"fighting wolves\" doesn't make you \"innocent as doves.\" Just because your reaction can be described as \"protest\" doesn't mean that you are in the right, even if the person or organization you are protesting is in the wrong. Wolves fight wolves, too, you know.\n\nThe only bit of advice I can give that will apply to everyone is this: Tell the truth. Don't exaggerate. Don't pass off your \"interpretation\" or \"speculation\" as \"observation.\" Don't gossip, and for goodness sake, NEVER LIE. Ordinary people make mistakes, but only wolves lie. So never lie. The amount of lies I have seen from GMU is the reason that this is happening. \n\nAnd as the good book also says: \n\n&gt;The end of all things is at hand; therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers. Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins. (1 Peter 4:7-8)\n\nAnd if you ever find yourself in a pickle, or need help due to the wrongdoing of others, the good book ALSO says: \n\n&gt;Do your best to speed \\[J. Caleb Jones\\] the lawyer and \\[Simms Showers, LLP\\] on their way; see that they lack nothing. (Titus 3:13, modified by my own interpretation)\n\nPerhaps an extremely good looking lawyer would be willing to help you.",

At the end of the day, officers are ordinary people. Some are absolutely amazing. Most are pretty good. Some are quite average. A few are downright malicious. In other words, they are ordinary people. \n\nWhen ordinary people mess up in their jobs -- whether they be doctors or lawyer or finance workers or construction workers or police officers -- the best thing is for that mistake to be appropriately identified, documented, and corrected, and for the one who messed up to be appropriately chastised (either in public or private depending on the magnitude of the offense), and get the remediation and training they need so that it doesn't happen again. That's what should have happened. But it didn't. \n\nInstead, what we've found is a culture at GMU that circles the wagons, protects those who do wrong, and punishes those who seek appropriate correction.

When drafting a complaint, if you don't ask for it, you simply won't get it. This number should not be seen as the money the plaintiffs are attempting to \"grab.\" Instead, it is a complex number that factors in punitive damages (which are designed to punish a wrongdoer, but are capped at $350,000 by state law), compensatory damages (paying the plaintiffs back for what has been taken from them), equitable damages (turning a bad action into some sort of \"this is the amount of money that we can fairly equate to that action to compensate you\") and nominal damages (which is just almost just a place-holder to show that a wrong has been committed). It is possible that some claims will go forward and some will not, which requires putting a large number together, so that even if 4 claims are not proven, the bad acts of the one claim against the defendants can still fairly compensate them and punish the wrongdoers.",

As the complaint explains: \n\n&gt;Allegations were made against one of the two Captains, all four Lieutenants, four of the eight Sergeants, and two non-law enforcement employees. As a result of these complaints, an investigative auditor with the GMU began an investigation, in which \\[plaintiff 1\\] assisted. The auditor\u2019s final report showed wide-spread violations of Virginia policy and law among the senior leadership command at the GMU Police Department. Such violations included the failure to record leave taken and the viewing, sharing, and storage of sexually explicit materials (totaling over 3,000 photographs and 80 messages requesting sexual favors), on state-issued computers while on state time. Additionally, there were confirmed allegations of racist and sexually explicit comments from command staff to other GMU employees, and theft of items in the GMU \u201clost and found.\u201d As a result of the investigation, approximately seven or eight members of the GMU Police Department left the university. Although no allegations were made against the GMU PD chief at that time, the chief elected to resign from his position as a result of the report.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After this investigation and exposure of the GMU Police Department, GMU retaliated against \\[plaintiff 1\\] by refusing to promote him according to his service and experience. Through a hearing before the Office of Employment Dispute Resolution in 2014, it was found that GMU wrongfully failed to promote \\[plaintiff 1\\] from Sergeant to Lieutenant and wrongfully moved him away from the main GMU campus of Fairfax to the Prince William County satellite campus in retaliation for reporting and participating in the investigator\u2019s 2012 investigation. Though the original hearing decision ordered GMU to promote \\[plaintiff 1\\] to Lieutenant, an administrative appeal challenged the hearing officer\u2019s authority to provide such relief. An administrative appeal decided on July 24, 2014 changed the order\u2019s decision to the following language:   \n&gt;  \n&gt;For the reasons stated herein, the University is ORDERED:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1) The University is ordered to create an environment for Grievant that is free from retaliation. This order shall remain in effect as long as Grievant is employed by the University.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;2) The University is ordered to provide Grievant with a remedy that accounts for and corrects its retaliation against him.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The University took no action pursuant to this revised order. Though an order was sought from the circuit court to enforce the hearing decision, due to the finding of retaliation connected to his failure to be promoted, the circuit court determined the order was too vague to be enforced. As a consequence, GMU did nothing of any substance, and\\[plaintiff 1\\] remained in the Sergeant position. Though \\[plaintiff 1\\] was promoted eventually, it was through normal processes and not in relation to his successful grievance. In fact, his grievance was a weight on his professional advancement. Other officers without a history of reporting wrongdoing rose in the ranks of GMU PD faster than \\[plaintiff 1\\], despite his experience and training.",

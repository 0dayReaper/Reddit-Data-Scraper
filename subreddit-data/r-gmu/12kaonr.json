    "postText": "I\u2019m a high school senior wondering about the systems engineering concentrations in operations research, data analytics and financial engineering. I can\u2019t seem to find the course material online but I want to see what types of classes I\u2019d be taking for those concentrations. I\u2019d also like to know what the job opportunities and roles these concentrations typically lead to.",

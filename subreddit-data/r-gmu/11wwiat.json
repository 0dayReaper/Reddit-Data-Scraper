    "postText": "So long story short I took the placement test back in 2021 (i think summer) and passed 2/3 sections. So I took math 123 but decided to take a break from math classes and ultimately changed majors. The major I changed to now gives me the option to take math 124 or math 108. I want to take math 108 rather than 124 because it\u2019s easier and i honestly forgot most concepts from 123. When I tried to sign up for 108 it said I needed a math exam score but when i try to sign up for 124 it gives me no issue. So do you guys think I could get an override to take 108 instead of 124 or am I gonna have to take the test again.",

I was gonna take 124 right after 123 but my schedule with other classes and work just didn\u2019t match up. So rather than changing all my classes around I chose to not take 124 but rather another mason core class instead.",

It is about whether it is /allowed/ its a yes or no question on whether George Mason allows this and it is a simple no. And per your second point, of course I cause no problems driving in a PARKING GARAGE. What else am I supposed to do with my car. But \"they cause no problems skating\"? I think you mean they cause no problems skating /yet/. What happens when they get hit by a car? Will it be the drivers fault? The universities fault?  The easiest to way to avoid any problems at all is to go with the blanket statement that parking garages are for parking cars, not for skating.",

The celebrations all occur shortly thereafter to allow everyone to have their name called and process to get individually recognized. \n\nNormally what happens at the Celebrations is you line up in your regalia, then you get a sheet of paper to write your name down on.  When your group goes up to the platform, you hand the note over to an announcer.\n\nSo, if you're eligible for the Commencement, you're welcome at the Celebrations too.\n\nDates of each of the College/School celebrations: [https://www.gmu.edu/graduation/degree-celebrations](https://www.gmu.edu/graduation/degree-celebrations)",

She said I would have to take one class for the summer finishing in July. I asked if I could still walk in May because that\u2019s when I was supposed to and she told me as long as I have less than 4 credits left I can walk. Again someone pointed out it could be different for graduate students :) so there might be a chance!",

I talked to my business advisor and they told me that there is no limit to the # of summer classes you need to take, no matter what college you're in. I'm not familiar with your particular situation though. I'm going to walk in May and will probably be taking 2-3 classes the following summer.",

Unfortunately the MSW program is a little more rigid, they won\u2019t let you take more classes because you have practicum hours to complete and they \u201cwant to make sure you have enough time\u201d to do so. Im glad to hear at least other programs aren\u2019t as rigid :)",

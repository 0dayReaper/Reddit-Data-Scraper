I thought IT-206 was hard af this semester and only did well because I studied like crazy. I really don\u2019t want to do that again for IT-207. Do I need a 60% on the final for IT-207 to pass the final?",

I would have reservations about taking it over the summer where you have much less time to get everything done. \nIn terms of quizzes, pretty much everybody bonks on the first quiz because it's based off a textbook you do not use for the rest of the semester, but after that so long as you are looking at the PowerPoints you should survive.\nThe exams are basically like your programming labs and if you do well on the labs you should not have too much issue on the exams. \nIMO IT-341 was way harder than 207.",

And for myself and everyone I\u2019ve talked to, it\u2019s the project that\u2019s gonna put hair on your chest. My TA told me that he thought it was unfairly hard so he graded very leniently. You\u2019ll essentially build a scheduling calendar where you can select times and dates, populate them onto a calendar, and send an email to the professor upon scheduling. The catch is that you can\u2019t use tables to build the calendar. Start on that thing immediately.",

                                    "comment": "With Blackboard (on mobile devices), if you click \u201csave draft\u201d instead of \u201csubmit\u201d for an assignment, the assignment gets stuck in the middle of submission, and the professor can\u2019t see it to grade it. Also, Blackboard is more likely to glitch on browsers other than Google Chrome. Idk what weird bugs Canvas and Brightspace have, but I\u2019m sure they have them too.",

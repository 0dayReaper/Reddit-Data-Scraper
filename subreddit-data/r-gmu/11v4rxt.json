What is acceptable risk? How much are we willing to pay? The intersection of those is everything. Clearly according to the GMU IT department, buying a domain to mitigate scams doesn't fall inside the area under the curve. My model, with admittedly incomplete knowledge of the inner workings and budget of the IT department would probably explore that avenue. It may be that I'm completely wrong, it seems as though according to you I would be if I worked at your company, but my reddit musings are just what is floating at the top of my head at the time. The only effort that went into what I said was how long it took me to type it up.",

This email probably didn't have a high enough SPF or BCL Score to cause non-delivery or quarantine, and it didn't match any blocked senders, blocked domains, blocked IPs, or blocked IP Ranges. \n\nJust report the email, block the sender or domain, and continue on with your life.",

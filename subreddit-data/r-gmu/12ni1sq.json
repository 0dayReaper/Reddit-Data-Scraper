    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m a freshman (20,M) studying cybersecurity looking to find one extra roommate for renting out a 4 bedroom house. Currently have found 2 roommates, one male and one female. Need one more so all bedrooms are occupied. It is less than a mile away from campus, 5 minute drive or 25min walk. Preferably looking for a female roommate (so each bathroom is shared by 2 people of the same gender). Must be a GMU student and no pets. If you\u2019re interested shoot me a message for more info.",

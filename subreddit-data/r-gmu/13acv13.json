I plan to live on suites so meal plans are required for me. So either it's independence or liberty. While I'm trying to get the cheapest one, they seem to cost about the same. So which one has more value?",

            "comment": "Depends! I have had both, and for me the independence plan is best. Remember, with the liberty plan you get 14 swipes per week, so that only covers 2 meals a day. For me, the bonus funds that came with the liberty plan ran out very quickly, but I also don't have a kitchen so I could not make my own meals very much. If you will have a kitchen and can cook a few times a week, then I would go with the liberty. If you don't, stick with independence.",

So id say independence if your good at maintaining a eating schedule or you could make a liberty work if you do like breakfest then dinner",

I have really few options to eat in the dining hall, and have been eating the same sandwich from the deli just about all semester bc it's all i like. The liberty funds don't run out unless you're spending excessively. Liberty 9 is good for 1-2 swipes a day and about $13 a day for a 3rd meal, which is better, imo than Only having the dining hall as an option.",

I know that we love to hate GMU and poke fun about how they poorly handle a situation but there is no way we are going back.\nEspecially since we are only going to see cases grow, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some GMU students get COVID-19. If VT and VCU closed when all of the cases in VA are centered around NOVA, then GMU will close too. Its only a matter of time",

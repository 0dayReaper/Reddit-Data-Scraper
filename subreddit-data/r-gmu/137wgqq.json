            "comment": "I graduated with my BA in English back in 2020 after I changed majors from IT during my Sophomore year. I really enjoyed my experience in the program: classes were interesting, faculty was generally solid, and the graduation requirements were straightforward. The coursework understandably requires a lot of writing, but I otherwise found it quite easy, perhaps even too easy as I sometimes felt I was able to coast through large portions of the semester without issue. It was also a fairly small program back when I attended, which lead to issues such as certain high-level courses having very limited availability. That small size made the program feel much more close-knit, though, and allowed me to work more closely with the professors and peers versus a large program like IT.",

I didn't even like collaborating with the students in those classes all that much, so I figured if I already hated the classes, I would hate working in the industry. I ended up excelling at the mid-level writing course that was a general requirement for all majors, and my professor suggested I swap over to the English program to further develop my writing skills. The difference between the two programs was night-and-day lmao.",

A couple of my friends who are in the gmu IT program told me the same thing, and they regret doing the IT major at mason as well. They say the professors are horrible, they have to learn everything themselves, they barely provide good instructions, and the material their learning is very outdated. They wished they could\u2019ve changed their major to something else, but it\u2019s too late because their already half way done. I wanted to do IT because so many people said if you want a high paying job IT is the place to go, but I don\u2019t find IT interesting or coding in general. I tried to teach myself the material and I bored. I want to pursue English because I love reading and I wanna prove my writing skills to become a better writer.",

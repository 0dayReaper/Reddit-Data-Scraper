    "postText": "Finals  are today, and every single assignment from the beginning of the  semester is ungraded. I'm honestly quite worried about my grade, because  I had trouble understanding the course material. No feedback of course,  so I can't exactly learn from the mini-project weekly assignments. It's  almost guesswork to me. I couldn't watch lectures because they were  behind a paywall on LinkedIn (lol???), so I had to basically read the  poorly spelled slides and read online articles about the topics. No  textbook for the course. Midterm was a complete wash because it was so  incredibly different than literally anything else in the course  (studying was almost completely pointless for it), so I'm very worried  about the final too.\n\nPlanning to  report to the dean. I don't want to retake this class because I'm about  to graduate, but I feel totally screwed over, both financially and  knowledge-wise.\n\nEdit: Speak of the devil. It was all graded just about a couple minutes ago. I got 100%s on even assignments I didn\u2019t try at all since I couldn\u2019t understand it. Not sure how to feel. At least I\u2019ll graduate unimpeded.",

If I write a paper I need feedback before the next, etc\u2026 that gives professors a few days for small stuff like discussion boards, and typically several weeks for essays and such. IMO this is a reasonable balance that gives the professor time to grade while fulfilling their duty to provide feedback so students can improve their work assignment to assignment.",

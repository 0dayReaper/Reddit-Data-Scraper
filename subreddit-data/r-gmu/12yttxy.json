    "postText": "Final update: The animal control place called back this morning and said that these geese were nesting in a higher spot than is typical and that it could be dangerous for the baby geese to jump down from that high. Both of the adult geese were on the ground level next to the building with two of the baby geese, calling to the four baby geese still on the roof. Got all four of the remaining ones down, and once everyone was on the ground, the whole group of geese started to leave, seemed to be heading to Mason Pond. Cute little family of geese.",

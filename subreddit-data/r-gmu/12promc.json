Idk why the College of Science wouldn\u2019t allow CLEP exams post-admission, even though GMU in general allows CLEP exams post-admission.",

According to Mason rules, students are allowed to take 1 CLEP exam for credit after admittance. \n\n&gt;Current Mason students are required to submit a\u00a0Study Elsewhere form\u00a0to their academic advisor for approval prior to taking exams after matriculation to Mason. NOTE: Students may only receive advanced standing once for a particular George Mason University course.\u00a0",

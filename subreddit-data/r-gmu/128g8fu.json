You can forward tickets to other people and wanted to know if there is anybody that may not have 5 people coming that would be generous enough to donate their extras. Ideally I\u2019d like 4-5 more but any are welcome.",

I also called the venue and asked for the reasoning behind this decision, and all they could give me is that they wanted to give everyone a chance to invite a group. We won't be able to get more tickets until the first week of May.",

The police said that they are seeing a ton of cars being stolen in the area recently. Be sure to lock up!",

It's a very old car, which is probably why it was targeted in the first place (manual locks/ignition)\n\nThe Flats is actually off-campus housing, which means Mason transportation isn't involved; it's a private garage.",

But also, that's dumb that Mason Transportation isn't involved. You should complain to whoever owns the garage and tell them about the security risk",

    "postText": "Hey \n\nI just received a decision at GMU and I was wondering if it is really worth it to get a degree in this university since it\u2019s a non-stem course and I\u2019ll be coming from out of country and it\u2019ll be a bit expensive for me,I even got an admission at DePaul University even though the tuition is ridiculously expensive I can cut save money since I can stay with my sister who lives there. Basically I want some help in deciding a Uni \ud83d\ude05",

The professors were totally checked out and running death by powerpoint, remotely, with no effective engagement. Much of the coursework was provided from other curricula.\n\nHaving a different master's going in, I was shocked by the contrast in my experience.\n\nIt's possible that in the time since I took it, GMU's CYSE MS got its act together.",

Because, while there's no proof that masks don't work there's no proof that masks work either.\n\nThere's proof that masks work in a controlled environment, but there's no evidence outside of that.\n\nThere's several issues and benefits to masks, and there's no study accurately and empirically proving their effectiveness:\n\n1) Masks cause more people to touch their face, they then get the virus on their hands and proceed to touch other objects\n\n2) Masks provide SOME protection against droplets and virions entering the air, meaning they're effective if the people with the virus follow proper precautions (huge if)\n\n3) Masks make people bold, working against social distancing\n\n4) Masks make it harder to talk loud, so people need to get closer to communicate, also working against social distancing.\n\nAll the \"evidence\" you hear about on news are highly politicized messages, where the \"evidence\" is either gathered in a controlled environment, or it's a mathematical prediciton model (which has proven wrong on every turn this pandemic)\n\nI just hate how the journalists are incompitent enough to fail to question all the governments bullshitting. Not just when it comes to masks, but everything in general.\n\nLong story short, don't think yourself all so wise by using masks. I use them myself due to government regulations, but I'm very sceptical about them actually achieving anything. You could be right or you could be wrong, so stop victimizing yourself and calling out everyone who disagrees with you. Your opinion is perfectly valid, I'm not saying that it isn't, but you should have some scepticism.\n\nWhy is it that you hate how the American government has handled this pandemic, yet you blindly trust them that masks work, when it runs contrary to the common consensus in Europe?\n\nEdit: If any of you downvoting lurkers out there disagree, at least participate by referencing a study. Downvoting me doesn't prove me wrong. I'm willing to admit to being wrong if you can find some good studies proving me wrong, I don't stubbornly stick to opinions for no good reason.\n(Preferrably a study that isn't funded by someone with a bias)\nThere're first-world countries that don't recommend masks, ie. the scandinavian countries, they do this for a reason.\nI'm not saying that masks don't help, but that there's a lack of undisputable evidence that they do. There's nobody that's properly informed on the issue that disagree with that.\n\nHere's a pretty decent article on it, albeit a little out-dated:\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-52015486",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I have been accepted to GMU and Binghamton SUNY for mscs for fall23.\n\nMy research interest is in AI, mainly NLP.  I have heard that GMU has a better course work and reputation in this field compared to Binghamton SUNY, but the cost difference between the two programs is approximately 15k. I am wondering whether it is worth joining GMU despite the higher cost?? Please share your opinion.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/12a3iks)",

Not to mention, good and bad professors are somewhat arbitrary and personal. And as you look to base your decision about a school based on the overall rating of professors at an institution, it becomes even more arbitrary.\n\nUnless you have someone you want to do research under or are guaranteed employment. Not worth it.",

So there\u2019s already a baseline benefit that\u2019s the same at either institution.\n\nThe main question you have to ask is: does GMU provide so much additional value that it justifies spending an extra $15,000 on it? Coursework and academics are irrelevant to this particular question: it\u2019s a matter of connections and opportunities, and if there are actually any differences in those between the two programs. \n\nWill your life look meaningfully different in 10 years depending on one choice or the other? If you can\u2019t think of any glaring differences that will end up paying the $15,000 back to you in spades, then this choice is splitting hairs.",

Classes too. \nOpportunities wise, well we are close to Arlington, and the job fair does include some good companies. \nBut apart from that, I'd say it's the same as any other Uni imo",

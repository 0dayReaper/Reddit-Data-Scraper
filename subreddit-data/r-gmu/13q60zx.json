Every week you read like 1-2 chapters of the textbook and then take short chapters quizzes on the chapter you read. He also assigns discussion post for you and/or team to post online. He also assigns a group project that he kind of critical about even though you dont learn some concepts until later in the course. But for the test, you really want to study the chapter quizzes b/c they will end up appearing again",

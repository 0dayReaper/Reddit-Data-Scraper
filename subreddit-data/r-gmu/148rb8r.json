    "postText": "Hello! I was just wondering if anyone can speak to a realistic timeline and the process for the Doctorate in Conflict Analysis and Resolution? Or any program in the Schar school. Online it says 4-5 years full-time, but how much of that is class and how much is research? Is the program available online since I will be traveling for work a lot? Any help is appreciated, thank you!",

NOTE: Schar is the public policy school, NOT the Conflict Analysis and Resolution school (that would be the Carter school).\n\nI am not in Schar or Carter. I haven't looked at their programs. But I can give you some context from the students I have graduated from the ESGS program.\n\nIf you have a Master's, most of my PhD students' time (though not necessarily the credits) is generally the dissertation research and writing. I'd guess it's \\~2/3s of their time. Given that you are going to be working a lot, a 5-6 year timeline seems like a good expectation to start with.",

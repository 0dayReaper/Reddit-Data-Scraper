Mason is no different than any other Major Public University. There will always be pros and cons for each, and it's where you feel the most comfortable and where you can vibe the most. Every University will have its own Flavor. I would suggest getting a cross-sample, not just here on Reddit but from many other sources, to get a balanced view.",

You're off to a great start in that direction. I would also look at the program's ranking and the reasoning behind it from multiple online sites. That will tell you how solid the program is, especially if the barometer reads the same or close to it, year after year.  If you can, I would come and visit the school personally so that you can get a personal feel for the school instead of solely through the lens of others. But if you can't, getting a cross-section of views from multiple online sites that closely share the same views and opinions will give you a better read on what the program and school are all about. I hope this helps!",

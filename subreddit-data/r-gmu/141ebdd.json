    "postText": "Hello! \n\nI live in a six bedroom house with three other girls, and I am looking for someone to take over my room once my lease is over. Rent is $700, and utilities are around $100. The house is located about 15 minutes away from Mason and 5 minutes away from NVCC. You\u2019ll get two rooms, I use one as my office and storage space and the other room as my bedroom. You\u2019ll share a bathroom with one other girl. The move in date is 07/01. \n\nOnly looking for female tenants.",

    "postText": "I took a few semesters off but I\u2019m finally graduating after completing my summer courses. At times I feel a bit burnt out, and I\u2019ll be taking four courses and doing a full-time internship at the same time, and want to be really productive for that reason.\n\nCurious to know if anyone else is looking to meet consistently on or off campus to chill and do some work! I\u2019m in the CHSS but I don\u2019t care what major or degree you\u2019re working towards to join :) thanks!",

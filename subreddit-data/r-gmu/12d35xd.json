I did not talk or make any interaction besides a hand gesture for them to back off. I got my grade immediately, but should I still notify my professor of that or should I not have to worry since my grade is already received?",

Your professor will play it back, see that there wasn\u2019t any funny business, and make their decision.\n\nYou\u2019re fine, just take your grade. Either you\u2019ll get an unfortunate email or you won\u2019t.",

I had the same situation on a math final and told them to close the door and leave and nothing happened. Even if ur Professor says something which is very unlikely just explain ur situation. Any reasonable Professor would understand. If not, you can always go to higher ups but that\u2019s not necessary until you get into that type of situation.",

If you were to get flagged for cheating for this, which you won\u2019t, you could easily appeal and explain your situation. If your professor was THAT convinced for whatever reason, maybe had a bad day or something, appeal to the school and go before the Dean and the committee. Wouldn\u2019t take long for someone to say yeah that\u2019s stupid and appeal it. It should be a fairly low-stress situation if you really didn\u2019t cheat and have an explanation/evidence to back it up (I\u2019m talking about all situations where people get worried about getting honor coded, not just your situation as I really don\u2019t think it would get there)",

Kinda silly i know lol, but it worked pretty well and my family left me alone",

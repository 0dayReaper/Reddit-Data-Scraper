    "postText": "Hey everyone, I know most of you all came from NOVA and transferred to GMU so I wanted to post this question here. I took a class summer 2021 online and it was horrible and I ended up getting a C in the class. However I retook it because I was at another university in a specific program where I needed a B or above to continue to be in the program. I retook it in Fall of 2021 and got an F because of my professor\u2019s negligence. I have proof of this, he didn\u2019t respond to my emails for a month, and canvas was unlocking modules late for me. It was horrible. I did try my best seriously, but I just had the worst luck. Other than these two classes, I\u2019ve been a straight A student. My question is, when I transfer to gmu next spring , ( I\u2019m finishing my last semester at nova in the fall since I left my previous university) will they see that I retook this class? and which grade will they take? The better one? Even if it was not the second time?",

Does anyone know of an indoor or semi isolated outdoor area where it wouldn't be weird to stretch during the day? TIA!",

I think that\u2019s really good to do but yeah you could go to west campus near the soccer fields and stuff if you really want a discrete place but I think anywhere is fine honestly. Don\u2019t overthink it.",

On nice days wilkins will be pretty lively nd there's usually some people occasionally falling off of skateboards so it's not like anyone's watching you.",

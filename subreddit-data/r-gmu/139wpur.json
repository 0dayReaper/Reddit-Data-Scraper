My family and friends make the statement \u201cjust get an internship\u201d, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK GETTING ONE IS THAT EASY. I get to go on linkedin and see my fellow mason students landing awesome internships and it\u2019s actually getting to my head. I never thought I could have developed such hatred towards someone succeeding. I\u2019m still trying to apply to all the leftover crumb internships but I guess I\u2019m gonna be studying for certifications this summer instead and paying off my fucking credit card debt doing doordash woohoo.",

Applying through places like LinkedIn is definitely the hard route since it's difficult to not only differentiate yourself from other applicants but it's also challenging to study for technical interviews. Events like hackathons give your the ability to showcase your skill directly and talk to the people who could either give you advice or potentially land you an interview directly.",

If you start running out of jobs or see the same positions on the different listing websites you\u2019re in the right spot. I remember when I landed my first internship I no joke applied to 300+ positions until I found a job I actually wanted. \n\nYour first round of internships will be a round of rejection, and its annoying. But once you get your foot through the door recruiters will message you on LinkedIn daily\n\ngl OP",

RippleMatch is a newer platform you should checkout, my turn out rate was impressive and they actually ping you and the employer I believe if there\u2019s been no response on your application. They send emails constantly on positions you match for and recruiters can invite you to apply too. I got about 5 interviews and 2/5 I got offers and this was for full time.\n\nAlso since we\u2019re already nearing summer I\u2019d look into getting a Research gig at GMU. It\u2019s been a fast process in my experience and it\u2019s easy to find a project that focuses in your field of focus. I talked to professors mainly to find opportunities but there\u2019s also a site on our school page that would help you find a project. All the research positions I\u2019ve done were paid and were good on my resume, research will have you doing some interesting and innovative stuff to help build your skills (in most cases). Here\u2019s the site: https://oscar.gmu.edu/students/\n\nResume tip, I made my resume in Markdown and convert it to PDF. Had no problems making it through resume screening this way and the extra touch I like is that I can easily embed links to my projects and I even add the pages to the jobs I\u2019ve worked in the title.\n\nAlso, post your resume everywhere! Literally any platform you have an account for that offers resume posting do it. Believe it or not I got an internship through Stack overflow, you never know where recruiters may be looking. They look for different avenues to find people.\n\nI know certifications are a huge boost in your field so here\u2019s a resource I use to get free quality courses on just about anything, you said you\u2019ve been resentful of people lately and you could literally find a course on meditation and mindfulness lol but, most importantly tech courses on certs: https://tutsnode.net\n\nHope these resources and tips can help.",

I remember applying to hundreds of places, getting a handful of calls back, sometimes even making it to the final round just to get denied. It was frustrating. But eventually I got that one \"yes\" and my life finally changed for the better.\n\nIt might be your resume, or how you are interviewing. I would go to the career center and get help with those documents as well as mock interviewing. Networking is also pretty big, try to find something in common you might have with your interviewer and bring that up. Finally, certifications. If you don't have your Security+, go out and get that ASAP. A friend of mine didn't do internships and still got a great job just because of that.",

I agreed with you on that, but you mentioned \"borderline fraud.\" And I am asking how you came to a bold accusation. \n\nIt IS related because I am wagering that the job cuts play a big role in the difficulty of finding jobs. But you countered with today's unemployment rate of The Great Financial Crisis this year as a basis to somehow imply that what OP is experiencing isn't that bad.\n\nSo let's explore this topic which you will also abandon as a \"Reddit argument\" because of your poor understanding of your presented facts  that form your opinions: \n\n1) the unemployment rate is a bullshit metric when a lot of those people are working multiple part-time jobs with an unlivable wage and no benefits.\n\n2) there were parts of the world who benefited from the great recession in 08 like china. But the whole world, china included, is feeling the pain of inflation which is causing riots and coups in some countries. And America is no exception to the difficulty of living in the midst of inflation which means that even if the TRUE unemployment rate is lower, a person who makes 90k a year has substantially less buying power than someone who made 90k a year in 08. \n\n3) the companies we consider to be tech giants today were a safer haven back in the great recession, but now you have even google employees talking about unionizing. And in 2008, google laid off less than 2 percent of their staff during the Great Recession. In January of this year alone, Alphabet laid off 6 percent of their staff. \n\nDon't try to feed us with what the Feds fed you because you are trying to peddle your bullshit you call your opinions with the greatest lie of all: statistics.",

Start using LinkedIn, market yourself and network with people. \n\nIf you\u2019re a US citizen, it\u2019s not very hard to find a job in security domain especially in DC area. \n\nIf you\u2019re motto is only to land up in a IT job, I\u2019d say be open to SWE internships too. \n\nAlso make proper use of Career Fairs, not just talking but connect with them LinkedIn. \n\nMason has a good Alumini Network who are ready to help, I\u2019d say before applying to any company see if any one is working in that company in LinkedIn, ask for referrals. I\u2019ve got interviewed in Octo, IBM through referrals.\n\nJob market in Security area is in uptrend now, be prepared to tap for the opportunities.",

As you mentioned you are an IT major, I\u2019m expecting you to have Java and Python Knowledge. \n\nIn general for what ever position you are applying, all well known Companies including FANG want you to clear their initial coding round in which you\u2019ll asked to solve at-least leetcode medium level questions.",

            "comment": "OP, allow me for a moment of unsolicited honesty: victimhood and a bunch of job applications will only leave you with a bunch of job applications. At best. \n\nThat out of the way, I know how you feel because MOST of us have all spray and prayed job apps to be where we are. And I started out at help desk after I graduated from the IT program because I couldn't even pass the pre-interviews for some of the companies I applied for. I felt like a fucking failure tbh but I am out of help desk now and am incredibly grateful for being help desk because everything I learned there has put me miles above my counterparts who are senior to me at my engineering role. \n\nThat said, let me offer you some more practical advice:\n\n1) drop that mass applier. That's what chatgpt is for. For every job app you have, ask chatgpt to take all your existing set of skill/xp/certs/etc and have it rewrite your job iaw the job reqs. And don't forget about the cover letter. Because now a lot more people are writing one since chatgpt can do it for them.\n\n2) fix your resume. Use chatgpt and use this to rewrite it. And as a general rule: star method. So, don't just say you did something. Say, how much of it you did and how much value it brought to the org. \n\n3) know about the basic fundamental shit of the job. Since you are cyber, I would expect you to not just know what CIA or SSH stand for, but how you would preserve the CIA of that org's assets or the strengths and weaknesses of SSH. you can also ask chatgpt for some interview questions for your position and also ask the internet for some more because you can never be too ready. Also, there may be a chance that glassdoor will have interview questions that applicants were asked for the same position you applied for so check there too. \n\n4) network. network. fucking network. Seriously, it's not just about what you know, it's about who likes you. Make every effort to impress everyone who you network with which means learning how to articulate your thoughts professionally, dressing professionally, and showing you are passionate about IT. Go to IT events like Bsides NoVA, NoVA Hackers, or any tech events that you can find on LinkedIn and EventBrite. There is actually something called Hack the Capitol you should go to. And even if you don't get an interview or a mentor, learn about the cool shit people are doing at these events. \n\n5) any chance you get, practice learning to speak to people because it shows how you deal with people. If you fuck up or it's awkward, don't beat yourself up because it's a skill most of us have to learn. And furthermore, you need to learn how to speak with people and deal with them because, even in tech, you will see the biggest bottleneck are people. \n\n6) get sec+. You don't really need all the other certs but sec+ is required if you wanna work for fed or fed contractor iaw dod iat 8570 level ii i believe. \n\n7)  don't lose hope. you can fucking do it.",

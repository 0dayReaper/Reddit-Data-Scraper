Has anyone taken Spanish 212 over the summer? If so what was it like? Was My Spanish Lab used? Any tips and pointers are helpful!",

It was much more culture/issue based rather than learning the actual language however we still reviewed grammar tenses and new vocabulary.",

She explained to me that 212 does not use MSL and is more focused on being able to read Spanish contextually. Sweet &amp; Bonilla both seem like pretty good options. The only real flaw here is that it is a summer class, but not much to do about that.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, needed some advice on what classes to take for Fall 23. I am an international student at Mason and don\u2019t know how hard/ challenging the professors/courses are here. \nI\u2019m looking at \n1. ECE 511\n2. ECE 512\n3. ECE 516 \n4. CS 571\nI wanted to know what classes would be easier to get through and get a good GPA.",

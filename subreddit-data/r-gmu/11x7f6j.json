One of my big regrets at college was not being able to take more electives. I transfered in with more than I needed, and didn't get to explore some things I had wanted to, there just wasn't room in my schedule. \n\nFind something you're remotely interested in and take a class in it. If you hate it, at least you tried to the point of spending thousands of dollars on it.",

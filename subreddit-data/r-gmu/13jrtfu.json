    "postText": "Thinking of applying, is the program your standard blackboard course with readings, weekly discussion board posts, a few big projects, and a couple instructor comments here and there? Or is there anything more innovative than that? Any online teaching opportunities, chance to publish a paper, get involved with virtual conflict resolution practice of some kind? Anyone feel like they're connecting with the people and program even though it's online? Honesty is much appreciated.",

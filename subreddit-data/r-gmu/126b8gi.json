Now because I don\u2019t know the difference between what it would be for Masters I would just call the proper number that\u2019s given dealing with anything graduation related. Me personally I\u2019m getting my Bachelors and graduate this spring and I\u2019m not going to the commencement. It\u2019s a waste of time for me to sit through the meaningless thing in my opinion unless of course you get acknowledged or care to hear the speeches.",

Like, do y\u2019all not realize you\u2019re a university? There are loads of days and times where you\u2019re less likely to mess with accessibility and people\u2019s routines. Real head scratcher, this place.",

But no seriously we should normalize walking downtown and across to university mall. I really wish there would be underpasses for all the roads\u2014 but this is America and we don\u2019t even have that in NY.",

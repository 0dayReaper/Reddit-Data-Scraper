    "postText": "I had applied to George Mason University for MS in Computer Science for fall '23. Recently i got my decision which stated that i am denied admit to computer science program but ECE dept is intrested in giving me an admit for MS Computer Engineering program, probably due to undergad in Electronics and Communication. \n\nI have around two years experience as Software Engineer at a Product Company and I was hoping to expand my career with a master's degree. And I'm really passionate about mobile app development and software engineering.\n\nWould like to know whether it be right choice to accept MS CE program at GMU considering my career goals and interest. While going through the syllabus i found that there is a provision to specialise in ML and AI in CE program which is intresting. Also, i would like to know whether i change my masters to SE or CS afterwards or take CS courses as electives in CE program.",

I would highly recommend you check out Mason's SWE program as well, as it's a highly reputable and well respected program from industry professionals.\n\nI'm personally starting the MS in SWE next year. There are many accomplished professors in the department. Professor Ammann and Offutt are leaders in research of software testing. Everyone I've talked to about it has had nothing but praise for Mason's CS department.\n\nCS is of course a discipline of science, not engineering, so work is going to be geared more towards mathematical theory and application.",

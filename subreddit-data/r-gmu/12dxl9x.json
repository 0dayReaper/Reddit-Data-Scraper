    "postText": "I'm trying to get through my lower level classes as quickly as possible (for a number of reasons), and I want to take advantage of probably the easiest semester I would have here. Here's my planned classes rn:\n\n* CS 112 (Not worried at all, have plenty of programming experience)\n* MATH 125 (Not worried, have already taken a class that's basically eqiv. to this)\n* PHYS 160+161 (Concerned for workload, but I think I can power through)\n* HIST 125 (Terrible at history, but if there's not too many papers to write I can get through it)\n* CRIM 100 (OPTIONAL, I hear it's a class light on homework and if it's easy I'd rather take it now)\n\nAnyone who's taken these classes, any advice or warning about any of these classes? I'm more worried about the workload outside of lectures/labs than anything else tbh.",

Since it's asynchronous, there's a lot of writing. And - asynchronous just means you won't have class meetings. You still have to turn stuff in as scheduled. You should expect 5-7 hours of work each week for a history class: 2-3 hours of \"class time\", whether in a F2F classroom or pre recorded lectures, and 3-4 hours doing the reading and homework assignments. In my class, also expect about 20 hours over the semester for the project. Workload might seem lighter in a F2f or synchronous course but work there comes in clumps.\n\nTl;dr: consider format, time, and professor. I can't speak for the others. My class is pretty straightforward and easy to middling difficulty if you keep up with the schedule.",

That class was impossible and a grade higher than a C is gonna require going to every class and putting in the work to understand the homework. (Homework was optional) If you miss a class a symbol might have been introduced that looks like some squiggly line or other which guarantees you\u2019ll miss a question with it on an exam.\nI got an A- in multivariable calculus while barely going to class but I failed Math 125 first time. You learn adjacent material and instead of the exams consisting of similar questions with different numbers it\u2019s a question you haven\u2019t thought of that requires a proof using methods learned in class. Nothing is available online and questions are not possible to look up. If Trey Andreani is still teaching please avoid. He releases exam practice questions without answers and won\u2019t tell you the answer when asked in office hours and because of the nature of the class there are no similar questions online. \n\nThe second time I took it the class cut a whole section on probability which was impossible to understand. I\u2019ve taken Statistics since and the probability I learned in that class is never even mentioned. \n\nIf you have developed solving proof problems then the class might not be as difficult and I\u2019m not sure how much Chat gpt could help with studying by yourself.",

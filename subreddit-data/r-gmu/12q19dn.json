    "postText": "Hi! I've been wanting to help start a language exchange organization here for a while and I was wondering if anyone here would also be interested in that.\n\nI was thinking along the lines of weekly events where we set up snacks and tables for different languages and people can chat with each other and learn about all the languages. \n\nThere could also be other events like foreign language movie nights if people are interested.\n\nI know they have something similar at UMD and it's really fun.\n\nThe deadline to apply for a new RSO is April 24th, so if this sounds interesting to you and you would be willing to become an officer for the RSO application, that would be awesome, just let me know in the comments or dms.\n\n I think we'd need at least 2 (but preferably 4) officers to join the application.",

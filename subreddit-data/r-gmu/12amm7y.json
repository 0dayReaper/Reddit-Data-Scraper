Be sure to be there on day 2 when you need to register for classes.\n\nIt\u2019s more for building a set of Peers so you have someone to ask anything during the first couple of weeks. The info sessions are useful only to those that haven\u2019t had any information on Mason before. And free food if that\u2019s important to you",

People are saying you need to go to orientation to register for classes: this is not strictly true and actually can be counterproductive depending on which classes you need because orientation is so late.\n\nIf you check patriot web in the class registration system, under \u201cprepare for registration\u201d you can view your \u201ctime ticket\u201d. On the day and time listed, you Will automatically be allowed to register for classes. You can use the planner section to make a list of what you want to register for, then all you have to do is a press a button when the time comes. Make sure you check the student profile to clear any holds that may be around beforehand.\n\nI went to the transfer orientation when I came in despite already having registered just to see if there was anything of value, and I found that there was no information that wasn\u2019t already on the transfer checklist or elsewhere in the website. If you want to talk to an advisor you can but I preferred to talk to them when they weren\u2019t juggling hundreds of students at once.",

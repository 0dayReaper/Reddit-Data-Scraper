I had another shitty semester despite taking less classes to get a better grade, but at the same time I know people who\u2019ve retaken a class 3-5 times and still be fine.\n\nI\u2019m in comp sci. Just be honest with me",

If you don\u2019t understand how to get out of that standing you\u2019ll be going in circles and going off assumptions.\n\nThe school goes based off GPA to  determine your academic standing: https://advising.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/Academic-Standing-Chart-scaled.jpg\n\nSo those people who\u2019ve retaken without getting warnings or other consequence probably just had that one class or just did great on most classes to keep their GPA up. I personally had to retake some courses and have never been on academic probation because I did really well in most other classes that semester. Unsatisfactory ranges from C- to F so having to retake doesn\u2019t mean you just flunked the course and those letter grades have different weights on your gpa.\n\nAlso I should mention that retakes allowed will vary , I know for most CS courses it\u2019s only three retakes and the third one you have to request the retake and give a plan to pass the course this time. Here\u2019s info on that: https://publichealth.gmu.edu/students/academic-policies-and-procedures/repeat-course-policy . Afterwards you can be removed from the school your in (College of Engineering and Computing).\n\nEdit:\n\nLooking at this information you can see you\u2019re still in the very early stages of this (if you\u2019ve only gotten a warning). You may want to try a semester where you take more electives than core classes, there are easy elective to take if you do your research. Also you might want to consider taking one class during the summer, preferably a core class but you can\u2019t let that be a shit show too and be a waste of time. \n\nI don\u2019t know what you struggle with but with most of us time management is a main cause at some point for most.",

I know there are some wizards out there that like to brag how easy it is but its best to ignore that nonsense. Everyone learns in their own way. Yes, it may take longer to finish but you will know your stuff. You just need a win under your belt to propel you foward. Nothing good ever comes easy.",

            "comment": "You need to maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or better to stay in good standing. If you were on warning last semester and don't get your GPA over a 2.0 this semester, you will probably be on probation, which limits you to taking no more than 13 credits next term.\n\nThe fastest way to get your grades up is to repeat any classes you didn't pass. The most recent grade is the  one counted in your GPA. If you received an F the first time and a B the second, the B will replace the F in your cumulative GPA.\n\nGo to Learning Services for academic coaching. They can help you with time management and strategies for learning in your classes.",

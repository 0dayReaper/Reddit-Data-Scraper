    "postText": "Hi everyone, I'll be moving to fairfax within the next few months and I'm looking for a 1 bedroom apartment within the $1600-1900 range but damn fairfax is expensive. The biggest problem I'm having is trying to get by the 3x rent requirement which a lot of places I've called in the area definitely care about. Do you guys recommend any apartments that aren't so strict about the 3x rent requirement and that are relatively close to the school (~30 minutes)? Thank you!",

(It is NOT the same as co-sign, as guarantor\u2019s name will not be on the lease.) Most of these places will accept your application if there is a guarantor. I currently live at Margate Manor in Fairfax and I signed my lease using one. I don\u2019t make anymore close to 3x my rent either. The guarantor would need to meet the 3x rent requirement though. Sometimes places want 4/5x requirements for a guarantor.",

Some allow guarantors/cosigners which could be a path for you. \n\nOtherwise you're only options are: \n\nfind a few roommates and pool together to rent a town house or something\n\nRent a room/basement on craigslist/fb marketplace/whatever.\n\nI rented a master bedroom with adjoining full bath for $750/mo from like 2018-2020 off a Craigslist ad in Fairfax proper. To be fair the house outside my room was uh, not great, and neither was the landlord who lived in the room opposite me. BUT, a master bedroom with a private shower, add some mini fridges and a hot plate and you're gucci.",

            "comment": "If you\u2019re a student and classes that take up the majority of your time, I\u2019d apply for a single on campus. If you are more part-time or have a full-time job with school on the side, and you can afford the $1600-1900 range, then there are Fairfax programs that can help potentially. Like the Affordable Dwelling Unit (ADU) Rental Program or Workforce Dwelling Unit (WDU) Program. If you don\u2019t make much, then the ADU is your better bet but if you are a full time working professional then maybe WDU. You can Google it on the Fairfax County website but basically if you are in a certain range of income you may qualify.  \n\nSome apartments in Fairfax County offer specific apartment units reserved only for people who qualify for ADU or WDU. The apartments that participate in the program are required to offer a number of apartment units to residents. So basically, any apartment you look at in Fairfax, ask if they have and ADUs/WDUs and what the requirements are to see if you qualify. Most apartments will never mention ADUs/WDUs voluntarily so you have to ask. ADUs and WDUs sell very fast. Most of the time they can enter the market one week and someone who qualifies signs a lease the same week. So you have to keep on top and keep asking especially if you know you can qualify.",

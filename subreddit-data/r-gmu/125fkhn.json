    "postText": "Labs are easy but struggling with projects in CS 262. Since this is classified as lower level programming I\u2019m considering if I\u2019m up for the challenge for upper level courses. I don\u2019t attend office hours because I heard there\u2019s not a lot of info they are allowed to discuss so I\u2019m a bit confused on what would be acceptable conversation. From experience would it be accurate to assess if I struggle with 262 projects  that likely suggests I\u2019m in over my head and probably unable to continue the CS track? Insight and personal opinion welcomed. I like CS and believe I\u2019d enjoy a career in the field. Just not feeling like CS enjoys me. \ud83e\udee0",

I too struggled in 262 and I believed failed it the first time. The projects are quite long and C is an entirely different beast of a programming language. Keep in mind nearly every core class after this except for 310 will be in C, so this suffering isn't for nothing. \n\nHave perseverance, as this major certainly tests this from you.",

Several are electives, but as of now I\u2019m clueless on which ones are next (without having to individually read each prerequisite.) Is there a standard sequence to follow?",

Make no mistake that CS262 is a hard class. If you come out the other side victorious then you\u2019ll be good. I suggest you try to understand during ~~vacation or during~~ summer break the parts that you didn\u2019t understand.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to study all day every day (a few hours every now and then should be enough). Understanding the material is extremely critical in doing good in 300/400 level CS classes. If you barely pass a CS class but feel shaky in knowledge that\u2019s a red flag.\n\nSo study during your free time until you get it!",

            "comment": "I wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say you should reconsider your major and career options. However, it\u2019s a good time to reconsider how you code and what\u2019s going on. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if you have async online or in person but some academic things you could do is to read/skim ahead, attend lectures, and ask questions about the topics you\u2019re struggling with. You should  also definitely attend office hours and ask questions. To think that they\u2019re pointless when you\u2019re struggling is wrong. You can\u2019t just show up and ask how do I code this part of my project or how do this project. But you can definitely go to talk about specific coding questions like how do I allocate memory or how do I assign variables? You can talk about your algorithms with the professor, and they may or may not give you hints but you gotta read the project clearly and solve the problem yourself. \n\nIn term of 262 projects, if you\u2019re struggling take a step back and look at the problem again. Try to solve the problem and come up with an algorithm. If you think you have a good/strong algorithms then try to code it. Throughout this process where are you struggling with? Algorithm or the language? \n\nI don\u2019t know who your professor is, but it might not be you and the professor\u2019s teaching method might not work for you personally. If that\u2019s the case you need to do additional studying outside of class. In my own experience, 262 projects were extremely straightforward and all the tools you needed to do them were given to you in the lectures and project guidelines. The problem is most people don\u2019t take their time to read the project descriptions/guidelines. So my advice is to read those slowly. \n\nAnyway, CS is a problem solving major, if you\u2019re struggling you need to debug and figure out what the issue(s) is/are, and why you\u2019re struggling.",

I was close to failing out of the major about a year ago and I was still working internships as an SWE even throughout that struggle. I was doing harder stuff at work than in class at most points.\n\nThe point of saying that is just because you\u2019re struggling with the curriculum does not mean you\u2019re not cut out to be in CS or that you\u2019re not a good programmer. Face that shit and keep finding a way if you want it. Some people are good at school some people aren\u2019t. But what you can control is whether you\u2019re going to give up or not.\n\nThere\u2019s students with top scores who can still end up struggling in CS when they get out into industry. The grades don\u2019t make you it\u2019s just an assessment to move forward. Real life is a lot more unstructured just keep learning and keep working towards what you want to do in life. Don\u2019t be a slave to the structure and keep confidence and positivity in yourself.",

Nice to see I attend the same uni with students like you. More feedback than expected so I\u2019ll go back over these again soon and try to heed some of the tips.

Using one formula to get an answer, taking that answer and putting it into a different formula. Doing this 4 times over and then taking all 4 answers and putting them into the final boss formula to get the actual answer.\n\nOh btw each of those first 4 answers totally look like they\u2019re the correct answer but they aren\u2019t.\n\nPro tip: do the practice questions they give you each week. Do them day and night. Do them until your fingers bleed from the shrapnel of splinters you have from overheated pencils exploding in your hand because you\u2019ve done them too much. Then and only then will you pass this class.\n\nAlso it helps to sacrifice a goat, it won\u2019t guarantee you a good grade but they say it helps.",

If u make sure to devote 30-45 minutes a day to mastering those questions, u will do very well in the class. Make sure to not get behind, and try to go to class as much as possible. Good luck!",

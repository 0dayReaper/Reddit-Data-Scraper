She\u2019s planning on being a major in accounting and I\u2019m majoring in psychology (B.S.).\n\nAre we able to be roommates? I know that dorms are separated by learning communities and we would probably be in business and social sciences respectively.",

Learning communities at Mason are something that you opt into, and they have specific areas in buildings. I'm not familiar with freshmen housing because I started during COVID and they picked the room for me. However, after that year I was able to pick my building and they had a roommate selection process if you wanted one. I feel like you should still be able to pick your roommate freshmen year but be limited to a couple buildings but I'm not entirely sure.",

            "comment": "You can apply for whatever housing you want on campus, it just would be more practical to apply for a dorm affiliated with your major since it would put you closer to the lecture halls. Since y\u2019all are freshmen tho, Mason is gonna try to put y\u2019all in president\u2019s park with other freshmen; my sister had a love-hate relationship with president\u2019s park when she came here her freshman year, and I didn\u2019t like it only cause I didn\u2019t wanna do a communal shower, so I chose to go to Piedmont Hall or the LGBTQ+ dorm instead. PH is newer, nicer, and closer to everything on campus, whereas if you\u2019re in president\u2019s, you\u2019re gonna have to walk to literally everything. Tho, a pro is that you would be right next to the Ike\u2019s of the 24/7 dining hall if you\u2019re in president\u2019s park, and since you\u2019ll be with other freshmen, it would be easier to make friends and socialize. Just do some research before you make your final decision and Mason allows you to choose a 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th option for housing. Also, be careful about living with a friend; sharing housing with a friend can destroy a great relationship. It doesn\u2019t always happen, but it should be something to consider.",

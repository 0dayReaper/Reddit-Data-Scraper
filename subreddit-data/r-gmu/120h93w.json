However the BIS program generally allows you to take classes normally reserved for a specific major granted you have met the prerequisites.  \n\nFor example, you can take IT 304: IT in the Global Economy as a BIS major, but you still need to meet the IT 103 or 104 prerequisite.\n\n&gt;Enrollment is limited to students with a major in Applied Information Technology, Applied Science, Individualized Study, Information Technology or Infmtn Tchngy Entrepreneurship.",

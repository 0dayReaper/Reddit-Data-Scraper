No compensation besides knowing you helped out a fellow student. \n\nIf there\u2019s any questions feel free to comment!\n\nThank you!!",

The ones that have disqualifying questions that were not mentioned in the post are the only ones that are actually annoying. \n\nex: survey is meant for Asian Americans only, but OP didn\u2019t bother to mention that in their post.",

I designed ours to just skip questions if you answered no to certain things so no one\u2019s wasting their time with questions that don\u2019t apply to them. \n\nEither way, thanks for taking the time!!",

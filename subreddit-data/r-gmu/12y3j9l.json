    "postText": "Hello, being a first generation student, I have been a bit lost on things relating to graduation. I did not realize there were preorders you had to do a few weeks ago and also money is a bit tight. Is anyone selling their cap and gown set? I am 6'1 and looking for a second hand set. That or if anyone has a set that I could borrow. Please do let me know. Thank you in advance",

Mine is on Friday May 19th @ 6pm. I have also reached out to the Gowns for Grads program but that is not something 100% so looking at all the options.",

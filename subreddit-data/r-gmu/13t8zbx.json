You need to verify your gmu.edu email to receive the discount through spotify.\n\nAlso since you keep your gmu.edu address for an indefinite amount of time after graduation, you can keep your discount even after graduation (unless Spotify changes the method to verify student status)",

So lets say your primary mail is \"NETID@gmu.edu\". \"NETID+spotify@gmu.edu\" will direct mails to the same place. You can put anything after a \"+\" and before the \"@\". Some services will not allow this feature, but Spotify does. This is also a great way to figure out who is selling and brokering your information.",

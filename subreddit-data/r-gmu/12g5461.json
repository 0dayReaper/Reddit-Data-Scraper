International students have it almost as easy as domestic students during a bull market but a lot worse during a bear market. This is mostly because government contractors who recruit domestic students are unaffected by market conditions. Almost all the companies at the recent career fair were government contractors who prefer domestic students",

However, as an international student, it would be slightly more difficult as many companies have contracts with the US government and are not allowed to employ non-residents.  \n\n\nIt's still doable. The Office of International Programs and Services or the career center will have a list of employers who hired students for OPT.",

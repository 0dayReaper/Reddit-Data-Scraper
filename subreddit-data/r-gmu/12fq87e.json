What if OP is an international student which Mason has many of? iPhones really aren't that popular abroad, or at the very least they don't have nearly as much of a market share. Sure a decent proportion of Mason students probably has an iphone, but enough to assume that OP definitely does? Sorry I have a hard time agreeing the proportion is that large",

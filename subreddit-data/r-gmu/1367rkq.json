    "postText": "I\u2019m in a group project with 4 other people. The project is a 4,000 word essay with a couple different sections. I came up with the idea for what we\u2019ll do, made an outline, delegated tasks (I let people pick what they wanted but explained what had to be done). Then I wrote over 1,000 words for it. It\u2019s due in 40 minutes and my group, all four of them combined, have written a TOTAL of 250 words. What the fuck is this?? This project is 30% of our grade. Unreal. Fuck y\u2019all.",

Would get all my stuff done, and even like with this last one, I was up at 5:30 working up something to get it done, and people finally started contributing after 10am, and fine-tuning and practicing literally went right until class time.  So yeah, group work is good, and also bad.  But really awesome if you have good people.",

My roommate and I are really not excited about sharing a bathroom with guys so i\u2019ve been trying to switch out or find people to switch into the room we are in to make it all girls.",

You can find info in the housing portal. All that said, you signed a contract stating you were okay with gender inclusive housing, so don't be surprised if you get denied for not being truthful. You could be sharing a room with a dude, be grateful you're not.",

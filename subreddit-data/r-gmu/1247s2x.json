It says that there is only one person allowed per unit, but I was wondering how strict that seemed to be, and if anyone had any experiences with it",

My partner stayed in my suite double (I had no roommate) for like 3-4 months and my RA did not care. Just keep in mind you will only get one key for the room &amp; building so you\u2019ll have to let them in all the time. If they also go to mason tho, I recommend a double. That\u2019s what me and my partner are living in now and it\u2019s perfect",

Theres an off campus gmu fb group which is mostly trustable. And the gmu off campus housing web page. Also, if you and your SO can afford, it might be better to get like a 1 room apartment or something my opinion:)",

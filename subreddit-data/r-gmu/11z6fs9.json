    "postText": "Summer registration opened up yesterday, and I signed up a day late. All the it-207 classes for summer 2023 are filled. I need this class to sign up for it-492. This will delay my graduation another year since it-493 isn\u2019t available in the summer of 2024. What should I do?",

            "comment": "This won't delay your graduation a year. Maybe a semester, but not a year. Also there's a reason 492/493 aren't offered over the summer. It's because you are on the same team and project for both classes, and you would have to make a whole team take a summer class. It has to be consistent for everyone, and it's just easier to do Fall/Spring and Spring/Fall\n\nGet on a wait list and keep an eye on the availability. People drop all the time, and Mason often adds new classes. You could also reach out to one of the professors, explain the situation, and ask for an override. Doing this at NOVA is not an option, you would need a study elsewhere form, and Mason doesn't approve those just because classes are full.",

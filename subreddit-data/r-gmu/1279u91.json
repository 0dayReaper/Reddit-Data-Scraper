The 2nd time I had actually recieved an incomplete for the class but then other life things happened. What does the process look like to get another retake for the class?",

I had been working through it but could not focus on it for the majority of the semester due to personal circumstances. But I'll definetly discuss with the professor as much as possible.",

The first two usually have unlimited attempts right? Just spam those, and then the last quiz in that module will be pretty easy. I was new to those concepts too, so initially I struggled with the homework assignments and project. Just speak to your professor over email or phone, and see if they\u2019ll do a rundown on the assignment",

You just have to submit a request, explain your situation with a success plan included (how you plan on passing) and they will let you take it again by overriding the restriction. But this is for keeps this time around but you got it",

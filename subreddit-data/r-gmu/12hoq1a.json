Does anyone know any good resources online (YT videos, simple explanations of the concepts, etc.) that could help? \n\nMy problem is that I am having difficulty understanding what he has written in the textbook and every time I see one of the answers to the practice problems, my mind just goes totally blank. Do you guys have any advice on how I can pass this class? (I heard the curve helps but I am trying not to rely on it too much)",

            "comment": "Cost effectiveness-wise, it's about the same for an on campus single apartment as an apartment at the flats, including USDA estimates for food usage. This doesn't include utilities, insurance, other COL expenses. That being said, the apartments at the flats are nicer and you have the perk of it being an actual apartment building and lease, meaning once you graduate you aren't forced out right away. It's also nice if you have to stay for summers (like me)",

I did the math too, factoring in the fact I needed summer housing, break housing, extended meal plan for said breaks, etc.",

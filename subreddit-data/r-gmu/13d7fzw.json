    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nSo I'm currently in a PHIL 309 class (async) with Derek Boyd and he hasn't 1) responded to anyone or 2) posted any assignments recently (within the past 2ish weeks I think). I'm just concerned because I'm graduating this semester and certainly not in the mood to deal with this lol. Who do I contact about a prof going AWOL? I emailed the college of humanities today, but no response so far so I'm still waiting on that. In the meantime is there anything I can do? We have a discussion board that was supposed to be last week and was never posted, a paper due on Friday that I gotta do, and a quiz this weekend that if I were to guess is also gonna be late. Thanks for any advice!",

This way you will have proof that you did try and contact everyone in case you need to appeal a grade or whatnot. \n\nFor the philosophy department take a look at the names and emails of the professor and those are the ones you should email (to keep in the loop). \n\n[https://philosophy.gmu.edu/people/full\\_time\\_faculty](https://philosophy.gmu.edu/people/full_time_faculty) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope that helps and good luck!",

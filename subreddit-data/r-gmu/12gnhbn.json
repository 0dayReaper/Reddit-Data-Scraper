    "postText": "I\u2019m a biology major finishing up my degree (fall will be my last semester) and I\u2019m trying to boost the amount of math classes on my transcript in preparation for grad school applications, specifically by copying as much of the CS major math sequence as possible. I\u2019m planning on taking a pretty heavy semester in the fall, and I\u2019m having trouble deciding on a class.\n\nMy last two major classes are PHYS245 and Biochem (lecture only). Along with those I will be taking MATH 114 (Calc 2). I have one more biology class as well but it\u2019s nearly zero workload.\n\nI have space for one more class before I hit 18 credits, and so I was wondering how heavy the workload is for Math 125. I\u2019ve taken large semesters before (I\u2019m doing 18 right now just fine) so I\u2019m no stranger to busting my ass.\n\nAnyone have any opinions on the workload for this class or professors to take/avoid? I seem to be able to choose between Agnarsson, Morris, and De la Pe\u00f1a.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nI'm planning on taking IT 207, IT 209, Stats 250 , IT 342, and IT 343 in the upcoming fall semester. For those who have taken these classes is this doable, or am I going to kill myself with the work load. Also, any professor recommendations would be really helpful and whether I should take these classes online or in person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks",

It sounds like 342 is not so bad if you have darla sligh but if you have to take it with jalinous or holdener, I would hold off on taking both of these classes until next semester unless there is someone in 207 who is really good. But even with a good professor for 207, it's going to suck either way whereas with 342, it sounds darla sligh makes her exam open book/open notes.\n\nIf you really wanna risk it, put yourself on the waitlist for sligh because at least 5 people are bound to drop the class for whatever their reason.",

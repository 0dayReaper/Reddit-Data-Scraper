I know people who do accounting that never got a degree, but as they inched their way higher up, the requirements increasingly become mandatory. This can be applied to other fields too. Not everyone in the medical field, for example, is a doctor. There are orderlies, technicians, scribes, etc., many of whom do not have a degree.",

Accounting I could definitely imagine teaching yourself, not so similar to a math class. Law requires feedback.

Graduate level it gets even worse, for lack of a better term. Only class I really picture that you need closer feedback are language classes, but a lot of technology these days can erode that requirement. Also, I really do prefer labs in person. Simulation is not the same. I digress.",

A diploma is proof that the university has tested you on the subject matter of a field and believes that you understand it. How well? See GPA, and grades in individual classes.\n\nAnd universities *themselves* are evaluated to ensure that those decisions are trustworthy. [ABET accreditation](https://www.abet.org/accreditation/) is the process by which a university established an educational program that meets certain quality standards - as opposed to, say, a diploma mill that is prepared to give anybody a degree without proper testing.\n\nNote that all of these objectives could be met without actually teaching anything. Lots of certificate programs exist that *only* perform testing, based on knowledge that test-takers are expected to acquire on their own.\n\nAnd many professions require both. Doctors must graduate from an accredited medical school *and* pass board exams. Lawyers must graduate from accredited law schools *and* pass a bar exam. Etc.",

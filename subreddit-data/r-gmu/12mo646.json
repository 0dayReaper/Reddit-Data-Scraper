There\u2019s no harsh workload either for his class. But my advisor said it\u2019s one of the hardest classes that students found in our major!",

Look at the course that it is a pre-requisite for - does it specifically say a C or better in Econ 103?\n\nIf so, you'll either need to retake Econ 103 OR get the instructor of the follow-up course to override you.\n\nI want to emphasize that the override is a big ask \\[and a mistake\\] if a C- is an adequate reflection of your understanding of the material, so some self-reflection is appropriate before making such a request.",

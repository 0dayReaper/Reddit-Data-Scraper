You have to take them, so use them to chase your interests and see what's intriguing. I've used a lot of what I learned in electives in my career.\n\nSince you're already at 14 credits and taking at least  two pretty intense classes, I highly recommend a 1-2 credit gym or art class. Something physical to give your brain a break while you fill a requirement.",

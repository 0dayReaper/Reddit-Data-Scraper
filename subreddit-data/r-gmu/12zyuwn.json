So, I would advise you don\u2019t give them any of your personal information (eg SSN) until you\u2019ve more thoroughly researched the company.\n\nSeems like bullshit.",

I looked at ads for like a minute to see if the content was appropriate for Facebook and it took 30 minutes every day (they limit you to 30 ads). The downside is it isn\u2019t paying you enough to replace a job and sometimes there won\u2019t be any content for you to review. I think it netted me about $260 monthly and it\u2019s a yearlong contract so account for paying back some taxes later.",

They don\u2019t advertise it as a full time job. Me and two other of my friends did it.",

Recently they've been giving out AI grading where you have to grade which response is better for what the query is asking.\n\nIt is legit, I get $14 an hour, minimum of 10 hours a week, max of 20 hours a week but they sometimes let you work 36 hours if it's a busy week.\n\nThey also do bonuses for reaching certain hours in the week when it's really busy. These past two weeks it's been do 10 hours get a $100 bonus, adding up to $24 an hour for doing the bare minimum.\n\nIt's really chill, I do it whenever I'm playing games or watching a show / movie, I have some friends that do it in class lol. \n\nAnd they say they ~require~ you to do 10 hours a week, but I went 3 whole months without working and they didn't really say much until the third month when they said they would terminate my account if I didn't log on, so I logged on and did an hour of work and they stopped pestering me lol.\n\nA lot of the comments in this thread think it's some sales vector marketing position but it really isn't, you're not a contracted employee and they send you a W-2. \n\nYou aren't really supposed to rely on it for your income but I barely spend money so I use it for groceries / chipotle.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions",

    "postText": "I had applied to George Mason University for MS in Computer Science for fall '23. Recently i got my decision which stated that i am denied admit to computer science program but ECE dept is intrested in giving me an admit for MS Computer Engineering program, probably due to undergad in Electronics and Communication. \n\nI have around two years experience as Software Engineer at a Product Company and I was hoping to expand my career with a master's degree. And I'm really passionate about mobile app development and software engineering.\n\nWould like to know whether it be right choice to accept MS CE program at GMU considering my career goals and interest. While going through the syllabus i found that there is a provision to specialise in ML and AI in CE program which is intresting. Also, i would like to know whether i change my masters to SE or CS afterwards or take CS courses as electives in CE program.",

GMU is within the limits i can afford.\n\n My sole aim isn't to pursue a master degree irrespective of the curriculum. Like i mentioned before I have certain interests in mobile development and software Engineering which i would like to research and expand my knowledge.\n\nThanks for the inputs i will surely connect with the grads from GMU for better clarity.",

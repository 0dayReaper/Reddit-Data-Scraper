Any idea on what I should do?",

It is FAR better to not take any classes over the summer, graduate late, but get internships. I didn't get any internships, because my first semester was after COVID, so no one did. The ones I had applied for dropped their internship programs for that year. My second year I had a job unrelated to my degree. And before coming to Mason in Community College, I just took summer classes. \n\nSo I never had an internship and it's been killing my chances of getting entry level IT work. Seriously OP, forget summer classes. Get internships. Although I suspect most are already filled up, applications opened like back in November.",

I said already in another thread that it was him who broke my 3 year 4.0 GPA streak. It's not a prerequisite for anything as far as I can remember, so when you take it shouldn't matter. Double check with your advisor though. It may be a prerequisite for a concentration class, or possibly an IT core class\n\nBut DEFINITELY don't take it over the summer. There's so much packed into that class that you don't want to be taking it at double the speed. And especially not with other classes during the summer.",

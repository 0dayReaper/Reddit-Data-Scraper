Rent and housing prices are high if you're coming from outside NoVa or not a big city. Wide variety of restaurants. I think GMU is also a Yellow Ribbon school so that is helpful if you use the GI Bill. Some professors are also veterans. I say most folks here are pretty down to earth and some are just experiencing the outside world for the first time.",

I never got a sense of hostility towards me by staff or fellow students because of my veteran status because of assumptions of different political beliefs (ironically I was probably more aligned with them). \n\nBut it's a good university to consider attending.",

Yeah I know I know they have their pull. But I suggest that as a veteran do not join them. There's a lot of drinking culture in fraternities and as a combat vet you don't wanna get hooked on alcohol. I'm not saying not tip the bottle from time to time, tip it occasionally. But just join groups and other clubs on campus so they can help you come back into civilian life.",

There are a lot of fraternities geared towards community service, job placement and summer internships. I'd recommend looking into any of the honors frats or ones related to your major. It'll definitely help with making positive connections within your field and may land you a job.\n\nAnd if you do come across a college movie type of fraternity, just be a grown up and leave.",

I think the age difference is less noticeable with many people coming from fun/crazy backgrounds.\n\nBecause I joined the military after my undergrad, I experienced the usual college experience. My younger guys who ETS\u2019d with me and went to college didn\u2019t. But this helped them focus on school and some of them actually finished a semester early.\n\nOP, it\u2019s all about the end goal.

But in DC it\u2019s not the first choice.\n\nFor being close to DC, I would try to go to Georgetown first. It\u2019s much more prestigious (the law school is top 15) and much better connected for networking. It\u2019s the alma mater of multiple presidents and all manner of high powered DC players. For networking potential it\u2019s the best that can be had in the DC area. They do yellow ribbon so there\u2019s not really a difference when it comes to GI bill payout. I would also look into George Washington University for this before GMU. They have a higher ranked law school and their political science program is one of the best and most well connected in the country. If you are willing to open up to slightly farther away, you have a top 10 law school at UVA, which is a public Ivy and way better than GMU.\n\nCost of school isn\u2019t really a factor in your choice, you should go for the best possible school you can get into, with the best networking potential. I would try to go to all these schools first before GMU for what you want. \n\nAs a veteran you stand a pretty solid chance of getting into any of these schools, despite them being very selective. Don\u2019t be intimidated by their reputations. You have a golden ticket here, don\u2019t sell yourself short. GMU will always be here and is still a solid option if you can\u2019t get into those others.",

Though, I did hear about people going to places like Harvard, MIT, or even GW use the yellow ribbon program though I hear that the funding can vary year to year and there is a cap on the number of recipients each year. \n\nGMU is not a bad school. But if I had to use my GI bill all over again, I would have went to UVA.\n\nAnd just the fact that you are a vet, you will already be ahead of the applicants if you want to go fed or fed contractors. Especially if you have been discharged in the last 2 years. \n\nSo pick a \"good\" school where the culture of the school fosters an environment for learning. Not saying GMU doesn't do that, but it's a commuter school and it's just different.\n\nOh I do want to note, the financial aid office is fucking terrible here btw. It's quite odd that the financial aid office at nova is astronomically better than GMU. The GMU financial aid office is absolute fucking dog shit and they can suck on the fattest dicks.",

For example, once someone is granted yellow ribbon once at a school they are guaranteed it every semester afterwards, and there aren\u2019t many vets at these schools anyway so hitting the cap isn\u2019t really something most people have to worry about. Vets are considered an affirmative action class and having them brings tax benefits and such to the college in addition to the income from the GI bill, so colleges are absolutely not trying to limit benefits to them.\n\nThere isn\u2019t really a financial reason to avoid private colleges on the GI bill.",

            "comment": "I took a 5 week course last summer with Costello. It was my first ever 5 week course, the material itself was pretty easy lots of videos and smart books If I remember correctly. I also had Covid during the 2nd week of the course so that probably made it feel harder.\n\nThe hardest part was the group project. I had a great group but you only have 1 week to write each paper which makes it hard for scheduling. On top of the papers you have 3 chapters per week.\n\nExams weren\u2019t so bad, If you can memorize material you\u2019ll be good because it was all multiple choice. I\u2019d say to go through with it, but consider switching if you work full time or if you have multiple summer classes overlapping. I had ENGH 302 overlapping so I was always busy during the 5 weeks.\n\nBest of luck!",

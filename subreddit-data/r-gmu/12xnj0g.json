    "postText": "I was just accepted in the Master's program at GMU with TA position and stipend; I'll be moving from out-of-state to the Fairfax area around the beginning of August. \n\nI wanted to know if anyone here has had experience with any of the housing options provided specifically for graduate students. Examples include...\n\n* On-campus Townhouses \n* Masonvale\n* Beacon Hall\n* Angel Cabrera Global Center (ACGC) ? \\[*Not sure if this applicable to me...*\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuite literally anything you have to share about your experience would be helpful.\n\n* Do you feel it was worth the money, or at least reasonably priced compared to other options?\n* How was the parking situation? \n* Did you have roommates, or were you in a single?\n* Was the University too overbearing or strict with housing? (Like a nosey RA?)",

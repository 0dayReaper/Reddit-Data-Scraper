    "postText": "So I realized I have bonus funds to spend and there's less than a month of the semester left. Noticed a good amount of the vending machines present in lecture halls/cafeterias have this big sticker going across the bottom that says \"Now accepting\" and then a picture of a student ID. Figured this meant they would take bonus funds. Tried three different vending machines with this sticker, and all of them say they either couldn't read the card or the card isn't recognized. Has anyone actually been able to use bonus funds at the vending machines?",

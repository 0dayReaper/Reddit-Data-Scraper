    "postText": "If you are looking to sail the high seas and hoist the Jolly Roger because you can't afford your textbooks, please keep in mind that some textbooks are available on the digital lending library of the Internet Archive. They may be one or two editions out of date but if that doesn't matter for your course, and if you don't need the online access materials, they could be very beneficial. It may not come up in a basic Google search, you should check their website specifically to see if what you need is there. I've had two classes now in two different departments where all of my class materials were available there.\n\nAlso, for any students with disabilities, the Internet Archive has a program to provide you with accessible versions of media they have in their collection.",

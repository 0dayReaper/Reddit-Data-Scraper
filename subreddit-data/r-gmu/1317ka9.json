Don\u2019t have time to learn and do OS related stuff when I know it\u2019s not what I\u2019ll be working in. \n\nI studied the lectures and understood the material for the most part but that project with the hundreds of files should really not be something given to students (unless they want to work in hardware or any type of job where they see themselves working with this). I hated it because OS is hard enough but I was also taking other hard classes and so I didn\u2019t have enough time to devote to this crap Lol. \n\nI busted my ass with all quizzes, hw, and exams so that at the end, we just wrote up what we wanted to implement and did what we could but I really said screw it. I\u2019m not gonna sacrifice my other classes and my sanity for 1 single project; especially since I knew even with 20 or 30% in that project, I would pass with a B. And that\u2019s what I got at the end :)\n\nDo what\u2019s best for you. Your well being is more important than that stupid last project. I knew I would never work with OS and indeed I have a great job as a backend dev. That project should really not be that extensive. It still makes me upset to think about it because the more I would look at the hundreds of files the more upset I became. \n\nJust do your best but don\u2019t sacrifice other classes for it. Not worth it.",

If you are familiar with how the shell project was in the latter half of 367, the same philosophy applies; if you put in effort, they'll give credit.\n\nIn my project, my partner and I only completed fork() and wait() and one more that I forget. Our waitpid() was messed up, and we entirely skipped execv(). We got a 95, I believe.",

If you have 10 lines of code they will most likely give you at least a 50%. And You can probably get a 60% if you have something that actually makes sense. This is the only project that they\u2019re understanding and nice about when it comes to grading. Don\u2019t stress too much just focus more on studying for the final exam which is more important. Who\u2019s your professor?",

            "comment": "I\u2019m in the I/O grad program but a different degree track. I\u2019m familiar with the MPS since it\u2019s same department, faculty, etc., and I\u2019ve interacted with a number of MPS students. Don\u2019t want to say more than that because I would like to not dox myself.\n\nThe MPS program is very regimented. All the classes, as I understand it, are formatted pretty much the same way: 8 weeks long, online asynchronous, with weekly assignments due on Sunday nights that are graded by the end of the day on Tuesday. Faculty members devise and create the content of these courses, but it all has to be approved by Wiley, the publishing company that I guess funds the production of these materials? Not quite clear on their relationship to the program but there is one. You also take all the classes in pretty much the same order as everyone else, though maybe with some leeway as not all classes are offered every semester. Those classes and their descriptions should be available on the I/O program website and/or the GMU course catalog.\n\nThe program is designed for mid career professionals who are looking to add some additional fancy letters after their name which will give them access to additional career opportunities. If you\u2019re not working full-time while taking the classes, you\u2019re not going to get much out of them, as many of the assignments require you to draw on your work experiences. They might even require you to work full time while you\u2019re in the program. This will be really difficult, since you\u2019re taking a bunch of courses on top of working full-time. I don\u2019t know of many MPS students who had an easy time with this, but I also don\u2019t know that many MPS students in general, so take this with a grain of salt but maybe try to talk to more of them?\n\nThere are some people who join the MPS program right out of undergrad, but I don\u2019t like to encourage undergrads to do that\u2013consider the in-person, two-year MA program first if you\u2019re in that boat. If relocating to Fairfax would be too much for you and the MPS tuition would ultimately be cheaper, then sure, go for that, but I just think the quality of the classes in the MA program is better (you\u2019ll be taking most if not all of your classes with PhD students), and especially if you have no previous I/O-related experience (so, think like stuff related to testing and assessment and/or HR), the MA program will set you up better career-wise. You\u2019ll be able to do relevant and pretty well-paying internships while taking the classes, and the pacing won\u2019t be quite so overwhelming. Also, from what my connections in the \u201creal world\u201d tell me, MA graduates tend to be more competent than MPS graduates. The scope of possible careers you can have will also be wider coming out of the MA program, because it will give you some research-related competencies that the MPS program will not. Even if you don\u2019t end up wanting to do a PhD or an applied research job, MA program alumni I know say that the researcher\u2019s mindset they developed has helped them immensely.\n\nThis appraisal is an incomplete one and you should seek out other opinions, but that\u2019s my two cents.",

I was thinking of using this program to help spring board my career into IO but after reading your thoughts I\u2019m definitely reconsidering it. I don\u2019t have experience within the industry so that\u2019s definitely not helpful instead I\u2019ve been working full time as a corporate staff accountant. This job itself is very flexible and I\u2019m not worried about being able to balance the workload as it is remote and I live in Burke. If an MA is definitely more suited to starting a career im going to consider it instead, as this is a pretty big career split choice to me. I won\u2019t lie the ability to take classes online and anywhere according to your regiment was a big plus for me with the MPS program so that does suck, are most classes in masters program limited to one or two time slots?",

It's *possible* that they might be open longer as RA/CA/CD End Of Semester operations will last a little while after all the on campus students are gone But I wouldn't push it. Try and get a PO Box at the post office if you can and reroute all mail/packages there if need be. Should be extremely cheap or free.",

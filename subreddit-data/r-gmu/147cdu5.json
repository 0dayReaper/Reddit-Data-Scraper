    "postText": "So I was able to take my final after my professor responded back 2 days after I posted in here\u2026 and I passed it. After that my grade in blackboard bounced up from a D to a B- which I was happy about. So after seeing that I was kinda happy but decided to take a break from school stuff including emails for a bit to focus on my mental. I decided to check my grades today and realized I got a C instead of a B- like it said in blackboard! Who can I contact about this? I have a Screenshot of both grades. That\u2019s a huge difference for me",

I hope your grade gets updated and you have a great life.",

You are tasked with setting up your own appointments by building connections with those who you do presentations for. Majority of the time they didn\u2019t want to give out names and numbers of other people (understandably). Which left you with a dead end, which stung even more when they didn\u2019t buy anything. \n\nYou also do not get paid mileage for the distances you drive, which left me paying for over 100$ in gas which was a little under. 1/3 of my pay check. Remember those benefits I talked about? I bought a set of knives with the block for a little under 700$ because the Regional Manager liked me and gave me a discount. That was about it. \n\nYes it is a scam, and yes it\u2019s a poor job for a High School student. Rant over.",

I\u2019ve heard some people saying it\u2019s pretty bad",

            "comment": "Considering your math situation I would just go to community college until u have passed calc 1 then transfer. That means u go to community college for one year and then transferring. In my opinion, it\u2019s not worth it to pay to go to Mason and live in less optimal conditions for classes that could be taken for less money. Or go to ODU for the college experience and take pre calc there. Costs the same as Mason but at least they have ragers",

If they don't get that, then yes they should take Calc through VCCS. 4yr students are advantaged over transfers, from anywhere. They could also take it over the summer.\n\nPlease skip pre-calc. Go straight into Calc.\n\nHousing is consistent and prioritized for first year incoming students. Transfer students have a chance but not as much. You will be required to have a meal plan as an underclass(person), which... let's say Sodexo doesn't yet have a better reputation....ODU for the college experience... No comment. Go to Hampden-Sydney, Washington &amp; Lee, Uni of Richmond.  \n\n\nEdit: at the \\*ODU RAGERS\\* you'll have a chance to meet the drop outs who decided to be amateur tattoo artists to work behind 37 and Zen.",

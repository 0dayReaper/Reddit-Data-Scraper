Better yet, how do students tend to feel about being in school in general (including their K-12 experience): good or bad?\n\nIn fact, I was under the impression that that ranking was based off of some sort of statistical survey done but I can\u2019t find any source for those listings. Most just point to the same one posted on a forum on SECrant.com which points to AL.com with no empirical data to back it up.\n\nIt\u2019s very similar to RMP reviews or reviews in general online, it\u2019s just a snapshot of the most discontent people at the school. Do they have their reasons? I\u2019m sure, but the fact of the matter is that Mason isn\u2019t much different from other schools in Virginia when it comes down to it. Mason is what you make of it.",

I met a lot of grounded people there and didn\u2019t really party that much, and mostly stuck to small gatherings and can say I had a fantastic run (despite COVID). There were also a lot of enriching lectures with cool guest speakers too thanks to being in the DC area along with a ton of off campus events to keep me busy when I needed to get away from campus. Most people ranking GMU and being unhappy probably quote the same stuff like it being a commuter school, not having a strong social presence in terms of on campus parties, and it being hard to make friends because of this.\n\nIf you go to GMU to go to school, it\u2019s definitely not true. If you go to GMU because you want grand social life exposure then yeah, you\u2019ll probably be unhappy which is why those people end up transferring someplace else every year (usually)",

            "comment": "It depends. But I'd say quite a bit of student dislike this school in specific areas. The dorms, SOME of the professors, THE DINING HALLS, Departments with their majors, Traffic Situations (hit and runs, drivers aggressive to pedestrians, etc.) Those are some of the things that make people hate school. I feel like you can be involved as much as you want with clubs, but that won't change the fact that you pay as much as any other university and get a subpar experience from the academic and lifestyle of things.\n\nI specifically hate the dorms, dining halls, and traffic shit. Why? Again, I pay thousands of dollars but in return I get unreliable wifi to do school work, an AC that doesn't even work (work orders still dont fix the issue), a toilet that leaks, the smell of boof in the hallways, loud ass neighbors from below and next to us. Those are just the dorms. The dining halls have given me food poisoning 4 times last semester and 2 times Ipopped blood vessels in my eye from throwing up hard, you get some mid ass lettuce with aphids and other bugs in them (seriously the people at the dining halls don't even know how to clean lettuce?), you can't even use all 1k meal Swipes from the independent plan (expcept for ultimate and extended) because GMU likes to disable them during breaks. For traffic, I've nearly been hit as a pedestrian and a driver because some girl in a Jeep or someone in a Nissan Altima from Maryland keeps thinking GMU is a speedway. I do love my friends I met at this school however. There are good people you can be friends with\n\nIn conclusion, this school does so little for how much we pay and I feel like a good chunk goes to the school boards pockets so they can drive Ferraris and McLaren 720s. You could have a different experience, but I wanna hear what everyone else agrees with and disagrees with on the things I listed",

I did get raw chicken once or twice, but I didn't recognize it as raw until now, I thought it was just bad chicken.\n\nAlso don't blame mason, blame Sodexo. They're the food company that runs all the dining halls and supplies most of the restaurants on campus, and they are a piece of work. The try to give all of their employees as few benefits is legally possible, to the point where multiple colleges have actually had students protest against them having a contract with Sodexo. Sodexo also constantly engages in anti-union tactics so as to prevent their workers from being able to organize to get better work conditions, and almost definitely supplies unsafe food because it's cheaper. \n\nThis is really important: don't blame the workers at Southside or anywhere else on campus for any of this, because they have no control over what kind of food and ingredients Sodexo gives them. They are all working for low wages, several of them I'm fairly sure speak English as a second language, and there's at least two people who are physically disabled working at Southside. Don't blame them for anything, blame Sodexo.",

Parking is unreasonably priced relative to similar universities and access. Internet is not only slow, but prone to constant failure. Educational quality and ranking is not consistent with tuition rates when comparing locally.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that a person unnecessarily subjected to regular concerns with food, sleep/living spaces, money, and necessary daily function will do so without complaint.",

Probably the main factors is the lack of integration clubs and organizations have with everything else going on. You go to class and go home.

I tried hard to make friends in classes (no I didn\u2019t join clubs) but it just wouldn\u2019t work. The students there really lacked in social skills from my experience. I attended three different colleges (2 year, Mason, and another 4 year) and my time spent at Mason was the unhappiest time of my life. This is just one persons experience so take it how you want.",

I used to think I made plenty of friends at GMU, did my fair share of partying, and was in some meaningful clubs. It takes lots of work to get in the scene compared to other schools, but once you're in you're in. Then I visited one of my partners who lives on-campus.\n\nI was SHOCKED by how dead and cold GMU campus is. Compared to my current friend circle and even my actual job in retail management, I was left wondering...am I really the autistic one (I am actually diagnosed autistic to make this make sense), because these people seem to all be completely oblivious and have no social skills. My current relationships, retail job, social/party life, and the area I live in are absolutely BUZZING compared to GMU. Grindr's a lot better too, so many people who are nonbinary or trans like me. Most of what you'll see on GMU campus is 50-year-old daddies in Fairfax Station looking for young meat. It's not just hookups, I've actually made FRIENDS on it out here.\n\nI am a boring adult with a full-time job who can only let loose on the weekends, and schedules hangouts weeks in advance. I recently had a bad breakup with one of my partners that took half my social circle, which made my other partners want to keep a little distance for a while. Yet even with dense crowds of people streaming between classes, coming back to GMU after a couple of months away felt almost post-apocalyptic compared to my current life. I lived in Baltimore for a Summer internship too, it's basically the New Orleans of the North so it really put into perspective how much the GMU area lacks in parties, clubs, and local music.",

Granted some programs may be more effective than others, but I can count on one hand the classes I found to be \u201cworth\u201d the money I was putting in.\n\nIf it had not been for the work I was doing outside of anything GMU related, I would not have been able to find employment in the DC area. The school was a \u201ccheck in the box\u201d at best, and provided a few good memories along the way.",

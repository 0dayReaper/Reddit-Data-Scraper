    "postText": "Respondus is without a doubt the most buggy program I've had the misfortune of dealing with in my time at Mason. I took an in-person final exam today using Respondus, and over half of the class had their Respondus program randomly shut down during the exam and cleared all their answers in doing so. Unfortunately, there were a few folks that couldn't make up for the lost time and had to make do with a 0. The professor also was not very sympathetic and basically shrugged their shoulders without giving the class any way to remedy the situation. A few ended up failing the entire class because of this issue.\n\nI have also had a few other experiences where it gives me an error message telling me I have been reported to my instructor and then it shuts down the program for some reason. I absolutely HATE this program. Not to mention the privacy issues of having it record you while you're at home.\n\nThis program is absolutely not refined enough to be used in an academic setting, and it adds unnecessary stress to the test-taking process.",

Haven't used it since. Didn't have any technical issues. I vowed to never take a class that used it again. That is the way, don't take the classes that require it. Hopefully they aren't required classes though. Most teachers should do is ask for a camera showing the students entire desk, hands, and screen if they are that worried about cheating, or don't have online classes at all.",

This *may* be possible, but I can tell you from first-hand experience that arguing for additional funding for these kinds of initiatives is a ginormous pain in the ass.\n\n&gt;no final\n\nBye-bye accreditation. Rigorous assessments and testing are required for the university's curricula to be certified and accredited so that its degrees can actually be recognized as degrees in the first place.

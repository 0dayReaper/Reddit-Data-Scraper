            "comment": "I didn't have either of them for physics so I can't speak on the teachers. But physics also really isn't my thing and I found the lab a really easy A. Don't get me wrong, it was incredibly boring and I hated almost every experiment hahaha, but the consensus I've heard is that most instructors grade on effort. Take that with a grain of salt tho, you could totally have the one who doesn't and definitely put your best into the reports! For lecture, mine was online so if yours is in person can't really say much about it. Since it's over summer and it's gonna be an accelerated course, you need to make sure to stay on top of any and all hw and prepping for exams. Use outside sources if you need to! Crash Course and Professor Dave Explains on YouTube both helped me. I believe organic chemistry tutor on YT has physics videos too. The best piece of advice I can give is to not memorize formulas and all that garbage, you really have to know how to use them. Also in my experience it's often unclear what the problem is asking you to solve, so practice as much as you can in identifying what it's asking for. Didn't realize this would be such a wall of text, but hopefully it's helpful! Good luck!!",

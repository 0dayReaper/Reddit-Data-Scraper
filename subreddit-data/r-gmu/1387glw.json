            "comment": "Made the same post on r/ncsu because the people from r/ncsu are quite biased regardless of the facts they present towards their bias:\n\n\nI saw your post from r/gmu. I'm sure the people here have very difficult classes they are taking but they are making it seem like we are ITT Tech just because we are a \"newer\" program with \"less rigor\" nd NCSU is MIT. \n\nNCSU isn't even Duke\ud83d\ude02 and even with Duke, tech companies don't think of Duke as the first people they want to hire. if school ranking even mattered when they hire people. \n\nI've met people in tech who have hs diplomas keep high paying jobs in tech. In fact, I understand some of the FAANGS don't even look at require college degrees for some tech positions.   \nAnd while I have not met people in ML without degrees, they exist. Not saying everyone can be Sam Altman and be a founder of OpenAI without a bachelors. But having the clearest illustration of how you plan to harness the shit you learned from school to deliver the most value to the team of that company matters the most and where you went to school will only increase your chance of getting your foot in the door depending on the school. So picking NCSU on the notion that NCSU is \"better\" than GMU is quite absurd because a lot of it is based on things which are difficult to measure, let alone rank. And sure, NCSU has been around longer but that doesn't mean I should pick University of Bologna over Harvard because Bologna has been around since 1088 AD. And again, NCSU it isn't Duke. And even with Duke, no one will bang on your door and demand an interview because you went to Duke. Because people think of the basketball team before even they think it is an ivy league. \n\nThis is all to say, go to wherever is cheaper and study your fucking ass off there and save your money. Because debt is expensive, and unless you know exactly which professor you want to do research for and what you plan on doing research for, invest that dime you saved into something that is more likely to get you a good return rather than some nonsense like \"the school has been around longer\" and the \"classes are way harder here.\"",

If you mentioned them because they are in the same state, then you forgot to mention Wake Forest, UNC Chapel Hill, UNC Wilmington, East Carolina, North Carolina A&amp;T, Davidson, and Shaw. Oh, and if you're looking in Virginia, well, there's UVA, Virginia Tech, Old Dominion, Richmond, Norfolk State, James Madison, Virginia Commonwealth, and William &amp; Mary. These all have good programs depending on what you're interested in. There's no reason to talk down NC State or Duke unless it came down to sports. There are good people that do good work there.  \n\n\nI agree with you its better to go with the cheaper option.",

It's not to shit NC State or Duke, it's to point out that an education at GMU is just as good as the education you can get at NC State, contrary to the bullshit that NC State students posted. Because if it were somehow objectively true that NC State is better for studying CS than GMU, it is not that much better because no company is seeking out graduates from even the most academically recognized institution in NC which is Duke. Because it is about what you put into your studies, not the school's ranking.\n\nAnd this is not a knock on Duke, I wager that if you examine the distribution of employees in FAANGS, you would see more from other institutions who have not had the academic reputation as long as Duke has.",

I\u2019m a senior at GMU and I live 10 mins from campus, I live in a 2 bed 2 bath and my roommate informed me she\u2019ll be moving out in august and needs to transfer the lease. If anyone on here is looking for a place let me know! The rent is 1100 before utilities and the complex is amazing- I plan to resign come November. I\u2019m 21- female, and hoping to sign another female who would want to develop a friendship with healthy living situation. Dm me for more info!",

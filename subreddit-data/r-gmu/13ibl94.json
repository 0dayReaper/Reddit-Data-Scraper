I realized that I should probably go over fares though:\n\n* The GMU shuttles are free, though you'll want to show your student ID (and presumably get one as soon as possible.)\n* The CUE buses are free for the present and foreseeable future.\n* The WMATA and Fairfax connector buses have fares, I recommend picking up a smarttrip card from one of the vending machines at Vienna station. Those card work with metrorail and basically every bus system with fares in the area. There's also a phone app, though a lot of people seem to have troubles with it.",

There\u2019s 2 that run every thirty minutes M-F. If you\u2019re riding the train there\u2019s a Vienna-GMU station that drops you off near school. There\u2019s 2 buses you can take to school from that stop. There\u2019s the Mason shuttle (you\u2019ll need your MASON id) and there\u2019s a CUE bus. The CUE runs around Fairfax city and is completely free! The last stop to all CUE buses is GMU. \n\nIf you\u2019re going to DC go on the train. Not worth going there on buses.",

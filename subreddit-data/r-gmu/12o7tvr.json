I chose Franks since it seemed like he had good reviews as a TA and wanted to give him a chance, but Haja has better reviews as a professor. Should I switch to Haja? Only thing I don't like is that his class is at 8:15 am lol.",

He gives very clear explanations and always ensures you understand the material better than when you walked in. So both of those two are good choices depending on what works with your schedule.\n\nI had Martha way back as a recitation professor online for Calc 3. I'd say she's alright and chill, just a little bit fast sometimes when going over new concepts. Nonetheless, she is genuinely caring but I'd still recommend going with either Haja or Joseph!",

    "postText": "At approximately 10:51 pm yesterday a post was created under the title \u201cthe confessor is a fake\u201d. However, mere minutes later, the post was removed by mods for \u201cfailure to fallow subreddit rules\u201d. The post in question was in relation to the recent confession of the tickler, and how it the whole confession was fake; and simply made to throw us off the trail, a red herring if you will. \n\n\nHowever after closer inspection, the post didn\u2019t break any of the rules. Now later that day the same user, who I will not name so that they may remain anonymous, made another post about how this meant that one of the mods could be the true tickler. But in similar fashion that post was removed as well.\n\n\nAll of this leads up to my main point, that there might be more to this story than we think. The tickler could be any one of us. And it appears that all the clues so far point to the tickler being one of the mods on this very subreddit.",

Personally, I've isolated myself at the bottom floor of Fenwick all the way in the back (passed the elevator and bathrooms) grinding at my degree. There is a great little spot back there if anyone needs quiet space to study away from everyone (or to sleep lol). But it did bum me out to see all the negativity at the ceremony and I also think that GMU could have found a less controversial guest speaker. Neither the less thank you to GMU and GMU community for giving me such an amazing opportunity to develop myself educationally.",

If I invite you to sing a song at my birthday, then change my mind and kick you out cuz no one at the party likes you, that's taking my platform away from you. You can still sing happy birthday in literally any other location you like, you're just not gonna sing at my party.

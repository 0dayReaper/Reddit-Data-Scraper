I met people who have passed the 200 level IT programming classes ask what a fucking global scope is. \n\nIn the end, it doesn't matter where you go to school. I've met people at my job who didn't even go to school that are in cybersecurity. \n\nAnd to focus on your post about GMU having a high ranking. Rankings are so arbitrary. You have to ask yourself why that source is saying that school is that given rank. For example, GMU's IT program doesn't even have a lab but idk about the cybersec engr program which I would imagine should have some bearing on the ranking.\n\nBut GMU did have people who went to some of the cybersecurity competitions and took top 3 a couple years back. But idk if that still holds true since the people on those teams graduated.",

            "comment": "The Cyber Security Engineering program here at Mason is ranked high in the Nation, which has been consistent, and regardless of the various opinions, that hasn't changed. Because of the program's growth, Mason has created a new Cyber  Security Engineering Department. And the program is still growing.\n\nThe program is also certified through the Engineering Accreditation Commission through ABET. You cannot even work in the professional Engineering space without ABET Accreditation. Regardless of what field of Engineering you decide to study.\n\nABET took the University through a grueling 18 Month accreditation process to make sure the CYSE program met its high standards. Mason didn't have to do that, but because they believed so much in the program, they took the extra steps to get the CYSE  program accredited.\n\nThis program is a specialized Engineering program, and that's why you have all the Math and Physics. Because, at its heart, this is an Engineering Degree. Like any other Engineering Discipline, all require Math and Physics.  Mason was the first in the Country to offer this degree because they brought heavy Senior Execs from Northrop Grumman and other corporations, along with Government feedback, to get their input into the next generation of Cyber Security Experts. They wanted the new Cyber Expert to not only be trained to react to Cyber Threats but also to be proactive in designing Cyber Solutions from the beginning. Other universities are taking Mason's lead in Cyber Security Engineering and creating their own program to be accredited through ABET. The Iowa State University of Science and Technology is just one example. They just got accredited through ABET following Mason's lead.\n\nIf you're looking more toward the traditional route, then this degree may not be what you're looking for, and Mason has other Cyber offerings you may be interested in. But if Engineering intrigues you and you want o to be a well-rounded Cyber Security Expert who can handle Cyber Threats and Design Cyber Solutions, then this degree is for you.",

Also when you say that in the hypothetical case of me not liking the engineering aspect, do they offer other cyber security degrees/majors that aren\u2019t engineering focused?",

                            "comment": "Hi...My interest became intrigued when a close family member decided to major in the CYSE program. I wanted to know what this program was all about, so I spent the past four years learning the ins and out of the program. Through him, I understood all the classes; I walked the campus, learned all about the professors, and got an excellent feel for each class he took. It became obvious to me early on what this degree was all about and what Mason was trying to accomplish. \r  \n\r  \nWhat also intrigued me was those who were new to the program and started complaining about all the math and physics they had to take. My first thought was, don't they understand what this degree was all about? Then it became apparent to me that they came into the program expecting a traditional cyber security experience, and the math and physics were just extra classes they had to deal with unnecessarily, which was the furthest from the truth. \r  \n\r  \nThat piqued my interest even more, and so I dived even deeper into the program all the way down to the ABET certification. I learned that ABET even created a study panel to assist them in creating new program criteria for all Universities and Colleges to follow to be accredited as a Cyber Security Engineering Program. And Mason was part of that panel and instrumental in their assistance with shaping the ABET Program Criteria. In the Professional Engineering space, you will be hard-pressed to land any kind of Engineering position without that ABET Accreditation. \r  \n\r  \nThen I heard complaints that Mason should do a better job advertising it as an Engineering degree. My thoughts on that, Mason, from the start, have made it very clear what this degree is all about. I think some people see Cyber and assume, right out of the gate, they are entering a traditional cyber security experience until they get that wake-up call with all the math and physics, which is a prerequisite for all Engineering degrees. \r  \n\r  \nI\u2019ve looked at both sides, Engineering and Cyber Security. In my opinion, that is a very powerful combination, and Mason had the foresight to see it! Engineering is designed to train you to be a problem solver, whether in Electrical, Mechanical, Computer, Bioengineering, and now, Cyber Security. Which, in my opinion, is a perfect match. Because Cyber Security is all about problem-solving, and now Universities across the country are jumping on board, Mason had the foresight to be the first in the nation to see it!\r  \n\r  \nMy motivation for writing this is to dispel any confusion on what this degree is all about and what they are entering into. Honestly, Engineering is on top of the food chain in whatever field of Engineering you choose. But it requires discipline and to have a strong background in math and sciences.\r  \n\r  \nThink about it this way, with an Engineering degree in the field of Cyber Security, along with internships, and certifications; you can write your ticket anywhere.\r  \n\r  \nAnd yes, the family member I spoke of landed a position as a Cyber Security Engineer making a high entry-level salary starting out.\r  \n\r  \nEngineering isn\u2019t for everyone, and you can still make a very high salary with an Information Technology Degree with an emphasis on Cyber Security, which has the least amount of math classes you have to take. It primarily focuses on securing the information on an organization's network. It\u2019s more of protecting what\u2019s on the inside of an organization compared to what\u2019s coming in, cyber attacks, and such. Or, you could pursue a Computer Science Degree (CS). That will amp up the math a bit, but it\u2019s a broader program if you decide to branch outside the cybersecurity space and want to get more involved with software development.  \r  \n\r  \nSo those are the main three. If you are interested in the cyber security field.. \r  \n\r  \nI hope this helped, and Good Luck!",

That will definitely make you a new breed of a Cyber Security Professional because of the Engineering and Design aspect. An internship was also helpful in getting my family member hired. So internships are going to be very important. I suggest obtaining an internship in your Junior year, so you will have enough classes under your belt to have an understanding and be helpful in your internship. Also, right about that time, or maybe a little bit earlier, working on your Security + Certification will also be helpful.",

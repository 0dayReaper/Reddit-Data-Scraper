They will limit you to 13 credits per semester until you do. \n\nRetake the exact same classes that you failed, the grades will be replaced by the most current ones. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t beat yourself up, I did the exact same thing last semester, which was also my first semester. It was only after I stopped blaming myself that I managed to get better. You got this \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

But that 1 failure was enough for me to get my mind on track and get out of academic warning and that was now 4 semesters ago! Good luck OP you got this!",

If you have Financial Aid and if your GPA is below a 2.0, the financial aid gets taken away. If it isn't taken away, then they will place you on a warning where if you mess up again, then they will take it away. I would recommend to try and balance your schedule out with easy courses so you can get your GPA up.",

This was my first semester at GMU having transferred from NOVA and my GPA is sitting at 2.16 or something near there. I was worried I'd drop below 2.0 and get booted but my wife looked it up and said I'd get put on academic warning first. Luckily it didn't drop below 2.0. It sucks though because I wasn't really expecting one of the F's and ended up having to take 2 finals in one day with one starting 15 minutes after the first technically ended. I had a little under 3 hours of sleep thanks to my 1-year old daughter throwing a fit all night. That math final was 40% of the grade :P So right now I'm taking MTH 125 and Phys 160 concurrently the first half of this summer (the two classes I failed) and I take Calc 3 the second half.",

    "postText": "Hello, \n\nI\u2019m an in state senior who is considering VCU and GMU as a computer science major. I\u2019m having trouble deciding which schools program would better suit me (I want to minor/double major in psychology in hopes of having a career in AI or if cs doesn\u2019t work, get my masters in psychology)\n\nSome info: I do want to dorm for at least my freshman year; vcu costs 1,500k~ less compared to gmu if I do dorm\n\nPros: Safer campus, better known for engineering, many internship opportunities from being located near DC\n\nCons: Afraid of not getting the \u201ccollege experience\u201d since many students at GMU commute and in order to save money, I will commute as well\n\nIf any former or current students, especially cs students, can share their advice of either schools, I would greatly appreciate it.",

            "comment": "Mason is not a quote-unquote party school, but Mason is what you make it. If your focus is a good Computer Science School plus internships, you are positioned better at Mason than VCU. The Virginia, DC, and Maryland Corridor is at the heart of the Tech Industry.\n\nAs far as Mason's reputation as a commuter school, that designation was once valid, but 6,000 students live on campus, which is a good ratio in comparison with other major public universities, here in Virginia. I actually had to look up the definition of a commuter school, and every time it stated, \"You have to have more students commuting than living on campus.\" When I checked all the Public Universities in Virginia, technically, according to the definition, they all could be called commuter schools because nowhere could I find more students living on campus than commuting. But many, many years ago, Mason did fit that definition before they really had on-campus housing, and regardless of all the current on-campus housing Mason has, including the construction of new housing, that reputation, for some reason, is hard for Mason to shake off, regardless of how many students are living on campus.\n\nAs far as a social life on campus, as I said, Mason is what you make it. Campus life here is not going to jump out at you, you have to take the initiative, but there are plenty of activities to keep you busy. For example, Mason 360, which lists over 850 Clubs, Organizations, and Greek Life activities, plus university-wide events; [https://mason360.gmu.edu/home\\_login](https://mason360.gmu.edu/home_login)   There's something for everyone. Also, you get to enjoy what Virginia, DC, and Maryland have to offer, plus all the friendships you can build here.\n\nSo if you're looking for a good Computer Science school, a great area for internships, followed by campus-life activities, then Mason is a great place to be.",

Lived on campus the first year, and then in a group house I managed for the rest of the time and some years after.  Have a friend that teaches at VCU.  I think you\u2019ve got the right questions, and the right answers\u2026.not up to date on the latest with the VCU CS department, but also don\u2019t see a lot of new folks on the various places we work at from VCU.  Also, the Mason AWS joint partnerships I consider also a big swaying point.  But your questions are good / valid - and you have to weight what is important to you.  Can answer more questions/chat it you want.",

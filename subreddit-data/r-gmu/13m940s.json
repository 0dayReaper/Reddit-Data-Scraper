Go to your nearby community College for an associates and then you can think about coming to GMU if you really want to, or transfer to a better school like UVA or VT instead of coming to mason after your 2 years are up at community College.\n\nAlso idk if many people are aware of this, but while it says mason has a high acceptance rate. It's definitely has gone down. Mason has gotten tougher since I enrolled. My sister who has a 3.1 GPA, has a bunch of extra-curriculars, and has an above average SAT score got deferred then denied from GMU which is shocking, same with her friends who are all AP students with unweighted 3.6 GPAs. So I'm not sure what's up with that, might be someone in admissions being petty or really taking race into account.\n\nTldr, go to NVCC",

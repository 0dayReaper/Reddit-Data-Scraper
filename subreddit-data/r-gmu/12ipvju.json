    "postText": "Hi y\u2019all,\n\nThere\u2019s one specific class I am really having a hard time in. Despite studying and going over guides, the questions are really difficult and do not appear as formatted on the guides. This is a distance learning class and I am concerned about my overall status of passing this class. Lab is 25% of the final grade which I am doing well in but won\u2019t be a huge boost. I have emailed several times to this professor about office hours, they scheduled a meeting and never showed up. What should I do? I am not given LA\u2019s either. With only two exams left in the semester, I am starting to feel quite nervous. What should I do?",

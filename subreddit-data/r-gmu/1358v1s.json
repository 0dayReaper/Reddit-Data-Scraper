The job application is asking me for work experience, but I haven\u2019t held very many jobs in my short history, but have done a lot of volunteer IT-related work during my high school years. Could I also count those as \u201cwork experience\u201d, noting them as volunteer work?\nWill that also affect me when they do a reference/past employment check?",

            "comment": "Yes, you can. I understand that it's a great way to fill your time while you're looking for a job. When employers look at your resume, they won't see this dead space. It seems that in the past, if someone became a primary caregiver and had to leave work, i.e. stay-at-home parent, it would hurt their chances of finding work when they are ready. Maybe its better now. Also, volunteer work is work - just non-paid work. You're devoting your time and maybe learning something new. What I believe they are looking for is  **relevant** work experience. If you can manage to do volunteer work that is aligned with your career goals, I think you'll be alright.  \n\n\n\\* I don't have any data to back this up.",

At the time they did not pay interns so I was essentially a volunteer, but most employers aren\u2019t aware of that actually. They do pay interns now I believe, or they will soon. Anyway I had it listed as \u201cfinance intern\u201d at said agency on my resume. Got several jobs with no issue. When they do the background check you can note on the background check that it was unpaid experience.",

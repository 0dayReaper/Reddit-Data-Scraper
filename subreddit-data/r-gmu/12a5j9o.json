            "comment": "im in an asynch online version of cds 130 rn &amp; i find it easy, its straightfoward so even if youve never had any coding experience before, you can finish the assignments with all the notes provided\n\nthere is quite a bit of work tho, it never takes me long to do it but it can pile up quickly &amp; i think most teachers of the course dont allow late work. if you take a 4 week version then there will be a lot to go over, with an 8 week course being less condensed but it will still have mutliple assignments due throughout the week (not just one due date per week: there will be at least two due dates a week)\n\nif its your only class this summer, you'll be fine. if youre stacking it with others, you'll still be fine but just try to stay organized &amp; dont forget about it",

But the workload wasn't too bad for a full semester class, and assuming it's still roughly the same then I can imagine its not gonna be too difficult to do in a condensed summer class. Just keep up with any small assignments and don't get behind! I'm sure you'll do just fine :)",

    "postText": " As we end the semester, I would like to share my experience with housing. For context, I am from VA and lived on campus in dominion, a suite-style dorm, in Fall 2022.\n\nI shared a room with my roommate, and a jack-and-Jill style bathroom (that locks from the inside only??) with a triple.\u00a0\n\nAt first, it was fine. The dorm had no mold and a functioning air conditioner. The shower water was very hard and took time for my hair and skin to adjust to.\u00a0\n\nSouthside dining hall was extremely mid food with the occasional indigestion.\n\nAir conditioning shut off in September despite temperatures still in 70 degree range outside. Carpet was very dirty. Fire alarms went off way too often due to residents burning stuff in microwaves.\n\nHowever, as I continued living in my dorm, problems arose with my suitemates. They were gross as fuck: They left hair on the floor, open used pads on top of the trash can, used way too much toilet paper a day, and didn\u2019t flush the toilet after using it. I brought up these concerns with my RA, then the Community Director. My RA led the most half-assed conflict resolution wherein I was blamed for losing my temper at the suitemates and they were politely asked to clean up after themselves. After a couple more attempts at conflict-resolution, I was getting nowhere. Nobody in the housing department was willing to listen or help with \u201croommate drama\u201d\n\nOnce the conflict died down, I received an email on a Thursday in November from the housing department that I was being moved to a different building (commonwealth) by Monday. I had less than 1 week notice to completely up and move my life.\u00a0\n\nThankfully, I was privileged enough to borrow an SUV and my partner helped me move everything over the weekend. I didn\u2019t move into the new building, I just moved home since I live in NoVA.\u00a0\n\nSo from mid-November - now I have been commuting to mason. Once again, I had the privilege of borrowing my brother's car to commute to school on such sudden notice. Additionally, I had both dorming and commuting friends, who helped me through this adjustment.\u00a0\n\nAlso, I let the housing video crew film my dorm for a youtube tour under the agreement that they would give me and roommate free swag, and they ghosted twice when I asked about it. \n\nI heavily underemphasized my difficult saga with the mason housing department. I cannot state enough that they are wholly unhelpful in helping you and will try to steal your money :) I had to have my therapist write the housing department a letter formally diagnosing me with depression and anxiety in order to be released from the 1 year housing agreement they make you sign before moving in.\u00a0\n\nSo to answer the question: **is gmu housing good? The answer is no.** Other buildings had no hot water, no AC when it was 80 degrees outside, and the dining hall food sucks. You are better off commuting if you are able to.\u00a0\n\nI dormed to have a college experience, but honestly, you can get a college experience commuting too. Just make sure to be involved in a club and make new friends.\n\nIf any GMU applicants have more specific questions about housing I am happy to answer. Thank you for reading.\u00a0",

It is a terrible solution in my opinion and is pretty much a punishment for speaking up for yourself. I understand if it's just basic disagreements/inability to get along but I feel like in your situation it's kind of obvious who's in the wrong.",

But, when I shower at home, my hair doesn't have that feeling let alone pulling out massive amounts of hair strands, same with all my roommates. It's bad",

            "comment": "Mason housing is a JOKE. I knew a girl who used to sleep in buildings around GMU because her roommate used to steal from her and housing told them to \"work it out\". As if she's just gonna stop stealing after you guys did NOTHING to her as punishment. My personal problems with housing come from the covid semester when campus was pretty much empty. I signed a lease but everyone in my 4 person room dropped but me so I ended up living alone on a dead campus with only online classes. Needless to say I feel into a deep depression and was losing a lot of weight (and sanity) just sitting inside all day with no one talk to and nothing to do. Durring this time we weren't even supposed to bring anyone from other buildings in or we could get written up. I tried to ask to leave but they wouldn't let me leave unless I had a note from a doctor or psychologist. I tried emailing multiple people in different departments, but they REALLY didn't seem to care at all about my mental state. I also love how housing does those room checks and if you have something plugged in wrong or whatever instead of leaving a note they just take whatever it is lol. I had some of those scented wall plug in things and housing just took them one day, never to be seen again. I've heard worse though, I remember someone had a post on here that said someone was living in their room while they were away. So I guess it could be worse \ud83d\ude43",

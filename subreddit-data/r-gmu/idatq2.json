Professors make practically no profit from writing textbooks. They write them to make their courses better.\n\nPublishers set the prices for textbooks and require authors to make regular updates so that they can continue to maximize their profits. If they don't update regularly, students re-sell their textbooks to each other and to the bookstore\u2014transactions that make the publisher no money. By requiring updates, they quash the used book market\u2014at your expense.\n\nUnless you've heard Rustici give the reasons you stated for assigning his textbook, then you don't know them and are just making uncharitable assumptions. More likely, his reasons are those of most textbook authors, which I've stated above.\n\nAnd many professors will tell you when an older edition is acceptable, to save you money. But sometimes older editions are not acceptable. When publishers force authors to update a textbook, they find out important stuff has changed and, in the interest of giving their ungrateful students the best education possible, they add that stuff to the update and teach it.\n\nThe cost of college is ridiculous, but there is an alternative: Don't go to college. Instead, work actively to improve primary and secondary education, employer training programs, and the mix of industry in our economy so that people don't \"need\" a college degree to get a well-paying job.\n\nIf you don't want to be that guy who sacrifices the higher paycheck straight out of college to break this system for everybody's benefit, then you've made your choice to pay.",

He might be making jokes about it but it doesn't mean he's getting rich off these or making the updates to make more money. I'm co-teaching a class this Fall with a professor who is assigning an article he wrote (uploaded for free online), but when he sent it to me he wrote in the email, \"Yes, I'm shameless.\" Professors are often self-conscious about assigning their own work because they know it'll be perceived as self-absorbed or self-serving. When in fact it's just the easiest, quickest way to give your students something you know works for the course.\n\nPre-internet, when professors wanted to use a collection of readings rather than a proper textbook, they had to collect readings, send them to the bookstore to copy, print, bind in ring-binders, and then stock for students to buy. Somebody had to pay for that work and all those materials and the shelf space, and it was students. It sounds like this guy has just found a way to go on doing the same old thing, rather than offloading it to the internet.\n\nBut if what you say is true and all these articles are available online, why is there even a post complaining about this? Just find out what the articles are and go get them online. Don't wanna do that work? Well then pay for convenience.\n\nWe're all making assumptions in this thread, but I'm making them based on a very large sample of textbook publishers, policies, and authors. The person I responded to seems to have made them based purely on a lack of charity and knowledge.",

Didn't you just call me out for assumptions?\n\nI didn't say they're articles written by him. I wouldn't presume that. The example I gave of my co-prof used an article written by him. Rustici uses a book compiled by him. That's the parallel there.\n\nRegardless, if they're articles available online, regardless of who authored them, you can get them online. You would be amazed how many professors\u2014especially the old-timers\u2014are totally incompetent when it comes to Blackboard. He is likely doing what he does because he lacks skills to do it another way, or because he thinks it's more convenient for you.\n\nHe *might* be doing it just to make money, but it's unkind to assume that of him, and it'd make him a moron, because publishers don't pay textbook authors much. And if you think he makes money doing a volume business, well, we all know [a hell of a lot of students don't actually buy the textbooks](https://uspirg.org/reports/usp/fixing-broken-textbook-market).\n\nYou can act high and mighty and call my obviously relevant comments irrelevant to justify complaining about this online, but a more productive use of your time would be to get out there and warn all the poor freshmen you feel so bad for that Rustici's books are a waste of money and hey, btw, here are all the links to the articles he'll ask you to read.\n\nDo you do that?

My co-prof is also a long-standing professor, and he did not assign that article via email. He sent it to me, his colleague, via email.

And he may not have the time to acquire those skills. \n\nSympathy is empty when you have the power to solve the problem but refuse to. It doesn't matter whose responsibility you think it is to change this. YOU could change it, and you don't. You could go give those freshmen those links, but you choose not to. You could make this right, even if Rustici is wrong, but you don't. Instead you do this. So the poor freshmen buy Rustici's book not only because Rustici is too unskilled/miserly/we don't really know what to change his ways, but because their fellow students are too lazy/selfish/something to help them.\n\n\"Surely has high profit margins\" \u2014 yes, for the publisher. Not for Rustici. Making the biggest assumption in this thread yet, if you did in fact go to college to learn and not just to get a piece of paper that gives you a higher salary, you might walk away from this conversation and do some research on textbook publishing, authoring, and sales, so that in future you can speak to this topic from the perspective of real facts and data rather than responsibility-shirking indignation.",

The majority of people taking his class are people who\u2019ve never had him before who are thought to believe the textbook is worth its price who do end up buying the book. It\u2019s not. Rustici treats his ability to assign a textbook as a way to make customers out of his students and it is fragrantly disgusting.\n\nEdit: I forgot to say that the \u201cclass has been the same for years, you should know what\u2019s covered\u201d is not a good point to make; that\u2019s literally how most courses in the school are. Not to mention that the fact the book is in the library or that he allows people to see it during his office hours are not unique. most professors do this and most introductory courses have a copy of their textbook in the library. what most professors don\u2019t do though is assign a textbook largely filled with otherwise free content that is advertised as necessary which he collects money from. If Rustici actually cared about his students and didn\u2019t see them as customers he would be more transparent and simply assign readings online like every other professor does. Boudreaux does this.",

Is that about right?  I just want to set myself up with an appropriate number of credits given that I work full-time.",

Yeah, I could almost see that, but at the same point\u2026.there are a lot of angles to take on it\u2026cybersecurity risks, academic integrity at schools, how instructors can leverage it as a tool in a course, which jobs are actually \u201cat risk\u201d from AI, what new jobs are/will be created from AI, etc",

I usually picked a day, usually saturday, and just sat down and knocked out all the work in one go. It\u2019s kind of hard to remember anything specific from back then, but the only thing I remember having any trouble with was the project in 304. Good luck with your classes!",

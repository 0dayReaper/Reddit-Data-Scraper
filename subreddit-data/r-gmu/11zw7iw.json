    "postText": "I  usually don\u2019t have a lot of time on campus, but for some reason, this  semester I have a six hour block between classes. I live far enough away  that it would be extremely inefficient for me to drive home for 3 hours  and come back. I don\u2019t work well on campus so instead I usually just  walk around campus bc I have been on campus for 2 years now and I  realized I didn\u2019t know where anything was so I take walks around and  through each building to pass the time.\n\nAlso I thought it would be funny lmao.\n\nTo  be clear, I have not been to every bathroom on campus, but I would say I  have been in most of them in the main buildings. From my experience,  the bathrooms are pretty similar between floors of most buildings (of  course with a few exceptions).\n\nNow that I am about to post this I don't know why I decided to do this.  \n\n\nWithout further ado, a full list:\n\nHorizon  Hall: Most are the same between floors besides the second floor. They  are all pretty clear during class hours but for the 15 minutes between  common class times they are the worst. The second floor is a exception  because it is significantly less clean for some reason.\n\nPlanetary  Hall: Probably one of the better buildings for bathrooms. The LL, 2nd,  and 3rd floors are always empty, and I have never really had a bad  experience there. The first floor is meh, mostly because of foot  traffic. The only slightly annoying thing is how the paper towel  dispensers are seemingly always out/broken. I will note, the lighting is  sort of recessed or something which is nice bc it\u2019s pretty dim inside.\n\nPerforming Arts Building: 0/10 I got yelled at for being there.\n\nExploratory  Hall: Probably the most middle of the road to bottom middle set on this  list. There is seemingly always traffic no matter what floor (albeit  there is a slight reduction for every floor you go up). There is always  something wrong with either the faucets/paper towels/etc. and there\u2019s  always water on the floor/sink. I tend to avoid going here if I can.  There are two variations of each bathroom, a small type and a large  type. The small type is fine but even one other person is too much while  the large is consistently more open, but also covered in water. Side  note: The mirrors on the LL have some black stuff or coating removal on  the bottom which is kind of an ick.\n\nKrug  Hall &amp; East Hall: Grouped these together because I think I have the  same experience for both. Pretty small, definitely made during a  different time. Not a fan of the sink being that close to people pissing  tbh. For some reason when I went to East a few semesters ago the water  pressure was crazy high and hot, but that seems to be fixed.\n\nLecture  Hall: God I hate this building. I forgot if there was a bathroom here  until I asked a friend because I never want to go to this building ever  again. Personal bias aside, I remember it showing its age. I wouldn\u2019t go  out of my way to go there, but it\u2019s not the worst. Definitely lower on  the list though.\n\nArt and Design:  Definitely the best overall during off hours. Never dirty and always  restocked. The cleaners here are chill and I have never been bothered  for anything. It\u2019s probably the baseline for all of these tbh.\n\nFenwick  Library: Fenwick has the most variation floor by floor and between old  and new Fenwick. I would say the worst one is definitely the ground  floor of new Fenwick. I actively avoid going in here. The water pressure  on the right sink is way too high and has crazy splash back, which most  people don\u2019t know until their second time going in there, and either  cover themselves, the counter, the floor, or whatever else they can get  wet. This along with the higher than average traffic for the building  and garbage air blade hand dryers make this probably my bottom tier. The  3rd floor is definitely the best. Overall, it\u2019s wider than the 4th and  5th floors, and has an overall better vibe. 2nd is way too busy.\n\nOld  Fenwick: Old Fenwick has by far my favorite bathrooms. Regardless of  which floor you go to, there are very rarely any people, the lighting is  good, and it is always stocked and clean. That being said, if someone  is there before you or comes in after, it\u2019s kind of annoying.\n\nDavid  King: As much as I hate these, I will say I have been to them more then  probably any other. I have had at least one class here every semester,  so I am very well versed in these. So, they are trash. No matter what  floor you go to, there always seems to be someone there. They all look  straight from the 80s-90s and I feel like if I were to get  bullied/killed, this is where it would be. Each floor has a quirk. The  top floor is the most decent, the ground floor has the weird frosted  window and high traffic, and the bottom has piss on the floor and a  broken toilet. (Bonus note: why is the handle broken on the bottom  floor? I asked my friend\u2019s dad who went here in the late 90\u2019s and he  said that handle had been broken then as well)\n\nJohnson Center: I want to be upfront about my bias before this: I *hate*  Johnson Center. That\u2019s not a joke. There are too many people there all  of the time and I don\u2019t like the vibe. Don\u2019t use the bathrooms here.  They are always packed and gross. At the JC I have been there while  people have forcibly opened a stall with multiple people inside, opened  the door while someone was busy lighting up, and had some random try and  look me in the eyes while I piss. Take my advice, go somewhere else.  Also, if you are any of the people in the situations I listed please  drop out.\n\nSUB 1: Like if Johnson center had less visitors and better cleaning.\n\nPeterson  Hall: Probably the coolest or close to coolest in terms of space and  cleanliness. If it was restocked more often it would most likely be my  favorite.\n\nNguyen Engineering: This  is the reason I wanted to write this. The engineering building has a  total of 10 bathrooms. I have never, and I genuinely mean this, *never*  been in a slightly decent one. The one that I think represents these  the best is the ground floor one in the statistics hallway (near the  glass front). It is always an out of paper towels, floor covered in  water, trashcan filled mess that I want nothing to do with. Multiply  that by 10 and you have the building. You\u2019d think that a building so  recognized for its engineering would have better paper towel dispensers.\n\nInnovation Hall: One of the better halls for size and cleanliness. Overall, I have never had a horrible time here.\n\nCollege  Hall (and all of the buildings connected to it + Aquia building):  Similar to East and Krug. Not really where I\u2019d want to be, but I think  the second floor of mason?(I went through one entrance and out another  and did the whole thing in one take) was pretty decent. I have only been  here during off hours though, so take that with a grain of salt. Aquia  building kind of folds into this. They\u2019re all so similar and mid that I  stopped noticing anything really interesting after a point.\n\nEnterprise  Hall: I decent hall for bathrooms. Very similar to planetary. The  bottom floor is probably the busiest, but other than that it\u2019s okay.\n\nResearch  Hall: An okay bathroom. I couldn\u2019t go up to the upper floors because I  was afraid of the construction, but it was a nice enough experience that  I would rather go there than engineering.\n\nAnd  that\u2019s all I have for now. I haven\u2019t been to Findley hall, the Hub, or  most dorms. I don\u2019t really have any desire to go to the dorms, but from  my experience I\u2019m not missing much. I don\u2019t think I could even get  through the doors if I wanted to.\n\nI  think my biggest takeaway from this is that GMU charges way too much  for its campus experience and maintaining something as simple as  bathrooms. I want to make it clear the cleaners for all of the buildings  I went to are fantastic. I mean, if you can clean the JC then you are a  saint in my book. As I went through these I feel like I became more and  more desensitized to their flaws and just how absolutely vile some of  them are after a bunch of students rush through them. Y\u2019all need to  clean up after yourselves. And stop splashing water on the floors wtf is  wrong with you\u00ad.",

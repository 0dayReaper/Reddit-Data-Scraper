    "postText": "I'm a recent Grad of Mason and I'm enrolled in the master's program here but it won't let me purchase a membership online for the summer. I've tried calling and emailing to no reply. I walked in and tried to pay at the desk but they couldn't resolve the issue either. This is what I see when looking at the sales portal on the mason recreation website.   \nAnyone else having problems?   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7fd8nhv8nm1b1.png?width=604&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0892368264f58d9bdbd8f7528f90446c50b57125",

    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nI am a sociology student of '23 wrapping up my coursework, and am enrolled in a poverty and wealth inequality summer class. For one of my studies, I must \"interview\" 10 respondents with no exclusion to demographic. The interviews are not lengthy, and consist of questions about your beliefs around poverty and changing the issue. You would be asked 4 questions, followed by 7 statements to agree or disagree to. This would be done by June 10th (yes, real soon)\n\nHonestly, I have nothing to incentivize participation with besides my sincere appreciation and gratitude (maybe some home baked cookies, I love to bake) . We are college students (and alumn) and have busy lives, but if you or anyone you know finds themselves free of time, bored, and interested in contributing to my study, direct message me!  Sharing this post would be sincerely appreciated as well. My discord is u/symbolicabsurdism\\#0216 .\n\nIf you'd like to just jump in: [https://app.voiceform.com/to/Xg11Ia8odl1sUYI4](https://app.voiceform.com/to/Xg11Ia8odl1sUYI4)\n\nBest.",

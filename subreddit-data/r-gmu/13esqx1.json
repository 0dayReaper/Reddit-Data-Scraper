    "postText": "So I\u2019m trying to choose a professor for discrete math and these are my option below. If you could add why this Professor is the worst or best by adding a few details abt them like the amount of hw, exams, extra credit, etc it would be rlly helpful.\n\n(I already searched on rmp but their are mixed reviews)\n\nGeir Agnarsson, De La Pena, Brent Gorbutt (Online), David Carchedi, Morris Walter\n\nThank you!",

He teaches you discrete math in the most boring rigorous way possible and there's no homework or graded work outside of exams. He just writes on his tablet the whole class and thats all you get.\n\nTBF though he will replace your whole grade with the final if you do well and his basically tells you what is on each test but damn. You have no idea why you're doing anything you're doing in that class. The entire time he just lays down theorems. He means well but he is not a good lecturer.",

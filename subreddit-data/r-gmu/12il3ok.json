    "postText": "So I'm registering for classes and CS 112 has a lab attached to it. For anyone who's taken this class, what was that like? Was it virtual or in person? I'm asking because I've set up my schedule to be as compact as possible and having to drive all the way to campus for this one lab would kind of suck, but if it's what I have to do I'll do it. (There isn't a prof attached to the block I chose so info on profs would also be helpful)",

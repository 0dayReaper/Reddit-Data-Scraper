He was accepted into mason in March as a transfer from NVCC and we just noticed the math prerequisite of an A or B in at least one math class and unfortunately he got a C in both calc classes and could possibly be getting a C in discrete maths. Is there any chance mason would let him retake it at NOVA over the summer for a better grade or is he screwed?",

I'd say his advisor but he probably doesn't have one yet. \n\nhttps://www.gmu.edu/admissions-aid/apply-now/how-apply/transfer/transfer-credit-policy\n\nAccording to that ^\n\nIf your friend has already been accepted in the school, then he needs to fill out the study elsewhere application in order for it to be approved. But as someone who tried to take one class outside of GMU, the application is very unlikely to be approved. \n\nThey aren't CS classes so he might have better luck than me but NVCC is too close to GMU for it to be approved unless the class isn't being offered at GMU.",

The commute you have sounds absolutely brutal, I would try emailing the registrars office about another online section being added and if the registrar is the wrong person to email, they will be able to point you in the right direction hopefully.",

The drive should only be an hour but since everyonce heading south when I leave it like 90 min drive. The only advice I can give you is to make sure half of your classes are online to avoid come as much as you can. Maybe you can take the class with the recitation next spring semester maybe that would work out better than coming up 5 times a semester.\n\nP.S. Take days off from driving when you can b/c commuter burnout is a thing. Honestly, I was never burned out from being in class or the classwork, it was always the drive that killed me.",

    "postText": "I got here in 2019. I was going through a major break up and could barely walk up to the registrar office to declare my minor ( at the time). Things were so lively before COVID. I went to the Halloween party near president park, went out a lot a friends, and was so easy to make friends! Then COVID happend and I took online classes, felt depressed and then things opened up. I loved every bit at mason, even the annoying never ending gen ed classes, summer classes, professors, students, and moving robots to deliver food. Not to mention the stale burgers in the dining halls. I loved everything really! My only regret is that I wish I made more friends after COVID. I love GMU \ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9a",

Nobody could've predicted COVID which threw everybody for a loop (I'm also class of 23). I think the secret sauce to getting through it all r the funny memories and even sad ones, the friends being the biggest factor in all that. Good luck to u patriot!!!!!",

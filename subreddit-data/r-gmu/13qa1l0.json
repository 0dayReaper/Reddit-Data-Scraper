    "postText": "Sorry if the title makes no sense, I had no idea how to work it properly. But basically, I registered for two summer 2023 classes, one in-person and one async! The in-person class is session D (10 weeks) and I thought the async class was also session D, but I must have not been paying attention or something when I registered, because I checked again and it's session B, which is 8 weeks. My question is not about whether I should drop it or not, but rather if it matters what session a class is taken in? Like is it weighed differently, or does it count in a different way?",

            "comment": "doesnt matter all that much, its just telling you how long/when the class starts. it helps students who are taking multiple summer courses and dont wanna overload themselves.\n\nand most times, a class wont be available for all types of summer sessions. if you picked an 8 week class, there most likely wont be a 10 week version, and vice versa.\n\njust be careful with staying on top of work for the classes. w/o knowing what exact classes youre taking, 2 summer classes is still reasonable as long as you work on the material for both classes almost everyday",

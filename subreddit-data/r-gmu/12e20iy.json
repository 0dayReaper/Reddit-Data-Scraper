            "comment": "CS455 is not the hardest class. The concepts were easy,  the exams were a little hard(depends on the professor), and projects were reasonable. CS463 isn\u2019t hard either, but the concepts are a little weird at first, but If you pay attention in class you will understand them. The projects aren\u2019t hardest either, but you\u2019re programming in different languages such as Haskel, Common Lisp, and Java. Make sure to give yourself a good head start on the weekly homework. CS471 it\u2019s a little rough. Make sure to get a good partner for the projects, you don\u2019t want to be doing them by yourself. I haven\u2019t taken CS477, but I heard it\u2019s project heavy. I think its doable, but this only depends on how good you are at time management.",

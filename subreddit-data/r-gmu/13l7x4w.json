GMU has spent a ton of money in the last year or two bulking out the number of highly paid fundraiser positions all across campus and at GMU foundation. Expect more of the same to come. If you make a donation, it only gets more persistent. Administrative bloat in higher education at it's finest.",

If you don't donate and show no willingness to donate then the attempts become fewer and farther between.\nI enjoyed my time at Mason but to me it was a transactional relationship - I pay for education and they give me education. It feels wild to donate to a school - like Taco Bell hitting you up for donations because you have fond memories of a crunchwrap supreme.",

I just finished ME senior design with substandard machining facilities and a the department staff position required for purchasing unfilled for 9 months.\n\nFrom the get go we were informed that 15% of our budget from our sponsor was being withheld for \u201ccapstone day expenses. \u201d Quick back of the envelope map says that 20 teams who each conservatively averaged a budget of $5000 totals to the department taking in $15000 to print brochures and posters, rent a tent and generator, and provide light refreshments.\n\nDid I mention the private sponsors write a donation check at the beginning of the project? Given you can\u2019t undonate to a university, if the money isn\u2019t spent by students on the project it just *poof* disappears into the depths of the department. \n\nThe lack of fiscal transparency is galling. As a VA taxpayer I should be able to see GMU\u2019s books at any time no questions asked. GMU won\u2019t see another red cent from me unless I know exactly where it is going.",

    "postText": "Does anyone know if the rules changed for rappahannock parking deck? I\u2019ve been parking on the second level the entire year but just got a citation today for parking on the second floor. In the notes it says I\u2019m supposed to park in level 4 or 5. \nI\u2019m so confused, I park there (2nd level) like every day and have never gotten a citation before. I always thought the upper part of the lot was for professors/faculty? \nAm I just insane? Or an idiot? \n\nAlso side note in case it isn\u2019t obvious: I do have a parking permit that\u2019s visible.",

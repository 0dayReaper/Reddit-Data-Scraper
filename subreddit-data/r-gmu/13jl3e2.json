    "postText": "Hello I am going to GMU in the fall and I live about an hour away from the Fairfax campus. I just wanted to get some more information about the shuttles. \n\nDoes the Manassas mall shuttle take you to the Fairfax campus? Lastly, would that be the best option or am I better off taking the metro? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks, \n\nOlivia.",

The SciTech Shuttle stops at the RAC, Finley Lot and at Sandy Creek for the Fairfax stops. I would say yes, it is a great option for commuting to campus. My only thing is that you want to watch the times, especially on Fridays and Weekends where the shuttle schedule is a little different. You also need to make sure that you have your GMU ID with you every time you need to ride the shuttle as the check if you have a GMU ID.",

I got a software engineering job within 2 years of graduating and I applied everywhere. Beforehand I just worked part time.\n\nDon't worry about experience. If it comes down to it, don't be afraid to go through a recruiting agency. They can find you positions a lot quicker than you can on your own. Within 2 days of applying, I had several interviews that they found me eligible for. You got this dude.",

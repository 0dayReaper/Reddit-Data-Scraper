    "postText": "I got a parking citation a few days ago and haven't yet paid it. I submitted the form to withdraw from a class and saw that one of the requirements is that ur account must be free of any financial holds and financial obligations. According to patriot web, I do not have any holds on my account. But the \"financial obligations\" part is the one that I'm confused about. Will this parking citation limit me from being able to withdraw from a class?",

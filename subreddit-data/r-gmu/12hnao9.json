    "postText": "Hi y'all, I have a collection of movies and shows on my computer from DVDs that I use Plex to organize and watch. At home I am able to watch what's on my computer over the network locally to my TV, but I am not able to do that here. \n\nBoth the TV and computer are connected to the same network (myresnet 5Ghz), but I am not able to watch my stuff. I would understand not being able to watch stuff from a different network, but I am trying to access it from the same network, but it is acting like the TV and computer are on different networks. \n\nIs this some kind of tomfoolery of how the myresnet WIFI service works? Does it treat different devices on the same network (and same router) as different networks? If so, do you know of any ways around this (wiring them with ethernet instead of WIFI, wiring them together with a crossover cable, some setting in the apogee website, etc.) I want to be able to watch stuff on the TV without having to run an HDMI cable to it from my computer.\n\nIf you have had this problem and/or know how to fix it I'd be grateful. Thanks!\n\nEdit: my plex server is in my dorm",

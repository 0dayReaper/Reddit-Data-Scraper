Unless they somehow hacked the VPN server he is connected to, or the VPN server went down while he was chatting, there is no way to know his real node IP. Its the kinda same concept as a reverse proxy where he is sitting behind another server that is making request on his behalf. In VPN case, traffic is encrypted from his node all the way to their chat server and goes through its own VPN tunnel. So all they can see is, the IP of the VPN server not his node.",

    "postText": "What has happened to our school? \nAll this Younkin talk has really made me concerned about the current generation at mason. \nWhat happened to not caring if they tore down whatever building? What happened to getting food poisoning from south side and shrugging shoulder \u201cmeh\u201d? What happened to sitting in the JC and being like \u201cthis isn\u2019t that bad\u201d? \nWhat happened to not giving a shit about what was going on at Mason?!\nRustissi made you buy his bullshit pencil prick book?! (That is actually the only thing that I gave a shit about at mason). \nStudent government? Who gave a shit? \nTuition? Who gives a shit? Basketball? LOL NO ONE GAVE A SHIT. \nCommencement speaker?! WHO gave an ACTUAL shit?!  \nLike who the hell was our actual commencement speaker?! \nDid any of y\u2019all go?! \nWhat happened to going to your school ceremony because you parents forced you, walking across that stage to receive a 8.5x11 rolled up piece of paper advertising the alumni association, and getting the fuck outta there? \n\nMy fondest memory of mason was not giving a shit about mason, and the friends I made along the way, as we sat in the JC, not giving a shit. \n\nBecause you know why? The school doesn\u2019t give a SHIT about its students (or alumni for that matter). All you are to the school is a phone number to call every freeking year after you graduate for donations. \n\nGo to school, have fun, study hard (or hardly study), but please, from a very accomplished alumni such as myself, PLEASE, don\u2019t give a shit. \n\nThis advice will go on to serve you well in your life if you learn early, not to give a shit about shit that doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nThis message paid for by all Mason alumni who had to endure studying in a fucking brick cube in old Fenwick, got food poisoning from Mein Bowl, or had bulshit English classes in Robinson. Be happy you don\u2019t know what those are.",

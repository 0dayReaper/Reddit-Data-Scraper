But Callus looks potentially just as solid based on reviews. Looks like you can't really make a bad choice here, up to you.",

Attendance is required but u have 5 absences. Her exams are multiple choices only, exactly the same as practice questions and you have 2 trials for each exam (except for the final I believe) which takes the highest score. Also, great slides and examples simplify the concepts.\n\nIn general, a lot of weekly exercise and homework but she gives enough time to do it. 4.5/5.",

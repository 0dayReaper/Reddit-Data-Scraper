    "postText": "Hi! I was going to register for CHEM 212 for the fall semester. I couldn't decide between the two professors. Qadri seems like a more lenient professor, but his class is on a Saturday morning. Dr. Tan also seems pretty good. The issue is I like to keep Saturdays off so I can unwind + catch up on work, as my Sundays are usually busy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was just wondering if Professor Qadri is significantly better than Dr. Tan or if both professors are good enough. I would just like a second opinion. Thank you!",

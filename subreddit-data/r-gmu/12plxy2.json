    "postText": "I spend a fair bit of time on various subreddits related to college and jobs, giving advice about how to navigate the challenging transitions from high school to college and then to a successful career. Last year, I [shared some advice to graduates](https://www.reddit.com/r/gmu/comments/uxr72l/some_advice_to_2022_graduates_from_a_gmu_alum/) that got a bit of attention. I have noticed a few common themes that I want to discuss here.\n\nIn the last few years, discussions about college have shifted dramatically to focus around worsening economic conditions, the rapid rise of AI, alternatives to college, and the desire for remote work. I also see a lot of people feeling resigned and without agency. \n\n* *It doesn't matter anyway, inflation is outpacing wage growth and I'll never own a house.*\n* *College isn't worth the money. There is no guarantee my degree will get me a job and I'll never be able to pay back the loans.*\n* *AI will render my degree useless in 10 years.*\n\nThese attitudes represent misunderstandings about macro factors that, while important, are not fundamentally changing the \"college equation\" and how success works.\n\nI would like to share a few important lessons that I have learned. I am a 2015 GMU grad who studied conflict analysis and resolution. I have worked a pretty wide array of jobs and internships, and my 20s were pretty fraught with existential crises about my career. I am now 29 and make a good living at a job I love.\n\n# Is College Worth It? \n\nFor most people, in most cases, the bottom line: **yes, if you put in the work.** College is not the free ride to a guaranteed career that it used to be. That is particularly true for liberal arts educations like *English*, *Communications*, *International Affairs*, *Political Science*, *Psychology*, *History*, etc. Degrees like *Nursing* or *Engineering* are more direct paths to employment, but you should still not treat graduation as guarantee of a good career.\n\n**If your plan is to simply attend classes and get a degree, you are wasting your time and money** (or, if you are so lucky, your parents' money)**.** Act like college is four years of all-expenses-paid summer camp, and don't be surprised when the rest of your life is spent paying for it with little to show from the experience.\n\nWhile there are exceptions -- self-taught coders, entrepreneurship, content creators -- the reality is that a four-year degree is still the *most reliable ticket* *to a successful career* (trades aside). Just because that is slightly less true than it was five or ten years ago doesn't mean it is not true. It does, however, mean that *you cannot misinterpret the degree as a guarantee*.\n\n# How Do I Beat the Average?\n\nIf you are looking at statistics about graduation rates, hiring rates, average career earnings, and feeling depressed about your future, understand that *those are based on what the average student does during college.* *Don't be the average student.* \n\nEverything around you at college is a potential resource. The vast majority of students use very few of these resources. Yes, classes and grades are part of that, but I personally believe the effort you put into activities, resources, and internships out of class make far more of a difference.\n\nYou don't have to be an academic superstar. You don't have to spend all your time doing things you aren't interested in. But you DO have to **take control of your future.**\n\n* **Internships.** Seriously. Do them. I can separate most of my college friends into two categories: those who completed internships before graduating and those who didn't. These categories lined up almost perfectly with who struggled in the following years to transition into a career, and who had an easier time of it.\n* **Networking.** Scary word, I know. Let me give you an example of what to do. You get an email about an upcoming event that seems interesting; some panel of speakers on a topic that sounds cool. Sign up to attend. Google the people speaking, the book or paper being discussed, etc. Spend 20 minutes reading up and writing down a few thoughts. Go to the event. Pull out your pad of paper and write down a few questions as you listen. Towards the end, raise your hand (or stand up and get in line) for Q&amp;A. Say something nice -- thank the speakers for doing the event -- and then ask a question. Politely listen to the response. After the event ends, go up to the person and shake their hand, thank them for taking your question, maybe ask another. Get a business card. Send them an email saying it was nice to meet them, maybe ask another follow-up question if you want to start a dialogue. *Congratulations, this person is now a connection*, and you can (carefully, lightly, rarely) reach out to them for career advice or in support of an application to an organization they have a connection with.\n* **Career fairs.** Go to them. Use friendly discussions with companies as a way to understand what they are looking for. Compare that to your resume and you'll have a good understanding of how to make yourself a stellar candidate.\n* **Research projects.** If you are considering an academic route -- working at a university, going for a PhD, etc -- *get into research as quickly as possible.* It is extremely important for you to experience different types of research and figure out if you really enjoy it. If you don't, academics is probably not for you, and you need to learn that *quickly* so you can pivot without losing time.\n* **Professors.** Many of these people have worked in jobs, or at companies, that you aspire to. Talk to them. Go to office hours. Ask them for coffee. Get advice and feedback about your career goals. Perhaps get recommendations for internships or jobs.\n\n**People will fail to follow through for you.** Professors, academic advisors (lol), career counselors... sadly, even parents, family members, and good friends will all fail to do what they promise on your behalf, or promise something that doesn't come true, etc. That sucks. That hurts. But the blunt truth is: *ultimately, nobody will advocate for you other than you.* You have to make it happen. You WILL have doors closed on you, people not email back, etc. You have to be resilient and keep trying.\n\n# Isn't AI going to render my degree useless?\n\nWhile we can't predict the future -- and AI is almost certain to be disruptive in ways that we don't yet understand -- I see a lot of people thinking about the impact of this technology on their education in ways that I think are not helpful.\n\n* **Major societal change will not happen overnight.** There is a long road, with many stops, between initial demonstration of a capability and perfect execution in a wide variety of circumstances with real-life impact. This will take time.\n* **Think about what AI can and cannot easily do.** \n   * As an example using my career space, writing and communication: I know people who freelance for websites writing copy for blogs, product pages, etc, to drive search traffic and sales. This type of work is pretty vulnerable to AI, even today. I could ask ChatGPT to come up with a list of article titles about... consumer preferences in mattresses... and then have it write each one in turn. The results would be *fine,* especially with a little editing and review. Good enough for me to fire the freelance writer. But this is extremely low-stakes work in which errors and inaccuracy can be tolerated, and there is endless similar information on the internet for ChatGPT to draw from. \n   * Compare this to writing a strategy or legal brief for a major corporation. Errors and inaccuracy can cost lives or millions of dollars. Most of the relevant information may be proprietary or different from existing writings in key ways that require careful analysis and verification to use rather than just copy-and-paste. And even if a document written by an AI was perfect in every way, shareholders, insurance companies and other stakeholders would likely be outraged if they knew the task had been completed by AI. A human has to take responsibility for the work. In this situation, one can clearly see how AI could be *used by a human* to help with the task, but the road to a world in which an AI can simply write the document with little or no oversight is quite a long one.\n\n**The way AI will affect careers over the next few decades is more nuanced than simply eliminating entire fields of work.** New technologies tend to change the nature of jobs, rather than getting rid of them entirely. They also tend to create new jobs in ways that are difficult to predict, but often quite lucrative. These transitions won't happen overnight, and they will involve many shades of gray -- or phases of transition -- from fully human-performed, to AI-assisted, to oversight of AI, and finally to fully automated with no oversight. In most areas, it's far more plausible that AI will support how people perform tasks for a number of years... during which new roles for humans in that area will probably emerge. It is definitely a good idea to stay up to speed with how AI is being incorporated into your area of work, and think about what parts of your job are easier or harder for AI systems to do.\n\n# I want to work remote!\n\n**There are real benefits to remote work:** saving time commuting, spending more time with family/friends/hobbies, more freedom in how you plan your day, living in different (cheaper) locations farther from the office, etc. I work fully remote at the moment and these benefits are undeniable.\n\nHowever, I would encourage you to consider a few things:\n\n* **It's not all sunshine and roses.** Working remote for many years can be lonely and draining.  It can be difficult to replace the lost social interaction, depending on your life circumstances. And it undoubtedly can affect your career if you have few opportunities for facetime with important people at your company.\n* **Early-career, it's really important to engage in person.** Learning the ins and outs of office politics and culture; networking in your industry; coming into contact with chance opportunities -- all of these things can be extremely important in your first few years of post-college work. I would highly recommend you consider working in-person first and transitioning to remote down the line if you decide it is what you want. You will be better off for it.\n* **Supply and demand for fully-remote roles is extremely out of whack at the moment.** A huge percentage of workers are dead-set on fully-remote, and a small percentage of jobs offer it. You are opting in for a much worse numbers game if you insist on fully-remote positions.\n   * *Consider hybrid work.* If you're able to work in the office two days a week instead of five, you see most of the benefits: you've eliminated 60% of your commuting time, have three days of opportunities to spend more time on other things, and still get to interact with coworkers and managers in-person to further your career. Yes, it means you can't live too far away from the office, but there is a lot of upside to this compromise -- and there are more roles will fewer people searching for them.\n\nI'll end my rant here, but I hope some of this is helpful for people figuring out their way through college, preparing to transition to the working world, or worried about macro-level changes in the world. I expect many people will disagree with large pieces of this post and look forward to discussing!\n\nGood luck, everyone.",

When I graduated with a general studies degree in 2021 after working for several years, I was offered a near $70k raise to work in-person almost every day and I'm having a great time.\n\nIf I had to offer my own piece of blunt advice, it would be to start saving money and fighting against things that just drain your bank account. Even if it's just saving $500 as a Freshman as an \"oh shit\" fund. I probably have a dozen friends that are 25-35 years old making $80-200k/year and are all equally broke because they blow all their money on cars, food, clothes etc. just to look good on Instagram/Facebook/Tiktok.\n\n/r/investing &amp; /r/Personalfinance exist and I discovered them when I was making $14.50/hour on-campus wondering how the hell I was going to afford a house in NoVa. You don't come out of the gates ready to buy a $700k single family home in NoVa. You save (at first small chunks) and invest money. If everyone in NoVa was forced to have their savings account balance listed on their Mercedes or their Instagram account, you would see a lot less people flaunting wealth the don't have and less idiots like my 24 year old self buying a brand new Mustang GT.",

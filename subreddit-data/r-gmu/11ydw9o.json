If you email them asking for a change, they can only change you to a random different type of dorm (such as going from a double to a random single on campus), but you cannot choose, they just throw you wherever you\u2019ll fit. Unfortunately selection is the only real time period of the year you get a chocie",

Idk if they keep some closed to release later or not (like for transfers etc). Glad I got a space. But spending over $13k for a room plus $700 to park for the year just makes me wish there were an easier process to potentially get a preferred space if one opened up. Last year (and idk if it was a glitch or they just changed it) but I was able to go back in to the application page, click room assignment and it allowed me to still see the vacancies.",

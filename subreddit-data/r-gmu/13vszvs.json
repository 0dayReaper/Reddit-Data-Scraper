    "postText": "So, I am an upcoming freshman as this post will probably make painfully obvious. I want to do a double Major and a Minor. Cybersecurity Engineering and Computer Engineering with a minor in physics, or some quantum physics classes, so I can work doing Quantum CYSE or Quantum CE. Does this seem doable if I put my nose to the grindstone? I\u2019m coming in with only 9 credit hours, so I still have 111 for just my Major alone. What are the odds I can do that in 4 years? Does it depend on what classes overlap? Can I do some summer classes? Thank you for any advice you may have!",

If there are courses that overlap with both majors, that makes it easier. Instead of taking additional courses, you could try to do an internship or work in a research lab in the field of your interest. Additionally, don't forget to factor in some downtime for yourself.",

You can take 5 classes (15 credits) of master's coursework that count for both undergrad and master's. The CpE master's has a concentration in cryptographic engineering that includes post-quatum cryptography.\n\nSo in 5 years, you can earn a master's degree with advanced coursework in an area you're interested in vs. the same amount of time for a double major.",

If you\u2019re able to grind through math all the way through differential  equations and physics 1 and 2, cyber with a minor in physics is pretty doable. If you add computer engineering to that mix, you will definitely need to add summer classes(especially if you\u2019re trying to graduate in 4 years) unless you are willing to spend more than 4 years in college. If I were you, I\u2019d do cybersecurity engineering with a minor in physics, and then do accelerated masters(or masters if you wanna take it slow and got extra money) in computer engineering.",

So, I'm here to tell you not to get cocky /lh. College courses aren't a breeze like high school ones, even the accelerated ones (AP, IB, AICE, etc). All of those are significantly easier in comparison. The biggest reason for this is time. Classes in university are only 15 weeks, not 36. All of your exams happen at once, and they make or break your grade since you tend to have 3 per class at most, rather than a much less weighted one every two weeks. Commuter burnout is real, driving in nova Sucks. Hell, even living On campus gets exhausting because the food here is awful. I don't mean to paint it like everything sucks, i just want to warn you, genuinely, that burnout is real, and it's coming for you just like everyone else.",

If you have a need for speed, you should make sure to keep summer classes open for mason cores if and when you can. Your degree doesn't 'start' your 4th semester. It can start your first if you want. It just depends on when you enroll in classes towards your degree. For that reason, i suggest mason cores over summer, so you can get more degree coursework done early (though, of course, you still need some mason cores during the semester to balance it out). Plus, who the hell wants to take a 5-week physics course over their summer break?",

Start slow, and build up. My first semester i only took 10 credits, and I've managed to increase my workload little by little so that i finished last semester successfully with 17 credits while working 3 jobs (two in my field). \n\nYes i think it's doable but it doesn't sound easy to sustain. I'd say, start aiming for 4\u00bd. In all seriousness though, if you spend enough time on patriot web, degreeworks, and your college's website, you can map out every single course you'd need to take every semester until you graduate, and then adjust if you want it shorter. You can access degreeworks on patriotweb &gt; student services &gt; student profile. Get out a pen and paper, write down 4-5 classes to take each semester, and use the \"what if\" function on degreeworks to see if those classes count for something and what you'll need to do from there. It's a miracle tool, i swear.",

Anyone got any ideas on what else I should take? Elective or something? OR what you did your first semester as a junior CS major.",

I took ECE 301, digital electronics. It was a fun class!.",

Again, with Professor Tompkins. \n\nTompkins doesn't go in depth with the weekly cases, he just talks about law and stories so you do have to get the book and read it. The course load was just to do the reading, take the quiz every week and prepare for the mock trial at the end of the semester.\n\nThe reading and quiz was maybe an hour a week if you went normal to a slow pace. But doable in like 30-45 mins. \n\nThe mock trial really just depends on your teammates. I got lucky, my teammates were great so even the mock trial project was easy, probably another 30mins to an hour every 2-3 weeks. \n\nI also took it alongside 471, 483, and 463. And my semester was relatively chill. 471 was a pain but everything else including 306 were great. Plus 306 wasn't a project heavy course so that made life easier with 471.",

It\u2019s so much more affordable to go here and that will pay huge dividends later. \n\nJust do the best that you can and apply yourself in your studies. Work hard and don\u2019t do the bare minimum in your learning. I\u2019ve found that what you get out of university isn\u2019t necessarily based on where you study, but more on how seriously you take your time here.",

You will need to get a masters and a PhD. Do the best you can here, get good grades, and then go to grad school. When you\u2019re in grad school your undergrad will cease to exist. If you chose GMU because you think it\u2019s right for you, you\u2019ll be perfectly fine.",

Lecture is kinda boring because Kermani only talks about concepts and literally only does one example per chapter, so there isn\u2019t much incentive to go to class. Exam wasn\u2019t that hard just study the lecture notes and textbook. Grades for HW and exam are never posted in blackboard for whatever reason (at least for 266, idk about 262) so when you take the final exam you\u2019ll have to check patriotweb to see whether you passed or not.",

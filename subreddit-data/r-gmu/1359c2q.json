Since you\u2019re a freshman it would really convenient to study abroad while fulfilling mason core classes compared to major specific classes that may not be available abroad. I regret not studying abroad but can\u2019t anymore since none of my major classes I need to take are offered.",

It's a good way to get some of your gen ed courses done so it's not too stressful and since you're studying abroad, there's some unique aspects about those classes that you won't get in GMU. Also, as a pre med student, I'm gonna be really busy during sophomore and junior year, so it made sense for me to do it freshmen year, when I have less responsibilities. If you feel like you're not ready to study abroad yet, then don't worry you don't have to do it now, but I really enjoyed it and I thought it was worth it.",

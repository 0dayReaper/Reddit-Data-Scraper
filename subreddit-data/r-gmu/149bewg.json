    "postText": "Hello ! I'm 30yrs old, immigrant, and I have been living in the us for 3 years. I am about to finish my credits at nvcc and considering transferring to another school to pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science major. I have a good GPA of 3.8 so far. I would greatly appreciate your insights and recommendations regarding the best schools for computer science programs for my age. I work full time and I don\u2019t have  time to have fun on campus, and socialize with students. My dream is to work in a big tech company but I am thinking to either apply for george mason, or VT. But other people say UVA will open up more opportunities for me because of my Gpa. I'm eager to hear your suggestions and learn from your experiences!",

Mason is great because if you want to socialize you can but if you just want to continue with your life you can do that as well. You only really get what you put into it so if all you want is the degree that works out fine",

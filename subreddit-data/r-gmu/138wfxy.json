    "postText": "Hello! I'm going to be transferring to GMU from NOVA (for the Fall 2023 semester)! I'll be going in as a junior, and applying the day/morning that applications opened for transfers (April 18th). I have a few questions about this!  \n\n\n1. How likely am I to get a dorm? I agreed to the Gender-Inclusive Housing if that makes any difference!\n2. If I don't get a dorm, where are the best places/websites to find students to group with for apartment housing?\n3. Anything else I should worry about? I believe I should hear back if I get a dorm around late may..?\n4. Not as relevant, but for the 2FA stuff, is there an app I should have downloaded to access the multi-factor authentication? I currently just get the bypass codes.\n\nThank you all so much!",

Granted, it\u2019s a shitty double dorm room so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s different for juniors.",

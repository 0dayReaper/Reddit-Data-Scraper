The only downside is it removes all of the minerals from the water or whatever lend to anything that resembles taste.",

            "comment": "Fun fact, While annoying to smell it is not harmful to us (altho i personally notice im slightly gassier since i drink so much of the tap water). Best solutions:\n\n1. Drink water from open containers and let it sit for 5-20min first (cups, mugs etc)\n2. Get a filter and leave the top off it in the fridge/room \n3. Add Ice. The cold water and the ice tend to disturb it more, so its not as smelly quickly.\n4. Buy bulk spring water (those 2.5gal containers), not shitty less enviro-friendly individual water bottles\n5. Im a tap water only snob, so i just plug my nose and chug it, like youd do in florida with their shitty swamp smelling water. Admittedly not a good solution for water sensitive people tho.\n\nThe gas will exit quickly as long as the container is somehow open/vented. It typically lasts about a week to one month depending on the area, and I heard this year it was extra heavy so be prepared for about a month worth.",

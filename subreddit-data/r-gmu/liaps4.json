No course content randomly thrown in 20 different places they totally made up, no full-course grades or scary-looking dummy items without all of the actual assignments itemized in the gradebook, no hunting for half an hour to find office hours and which of the listed Zoom links, phone numbers, and collaborate sessions they actually answer to. Canvas is the digital version of a square classroom with a professor's desk, student desks, a whiteboard, a projector, and a podium with a gradebook inside. If the professor doesn't want to learn how to use it as-is, or thinks it's not good enough for their \"teaching style,\" what they can do is quit their job.",

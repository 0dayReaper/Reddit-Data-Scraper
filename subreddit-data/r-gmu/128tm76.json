    "postText": "I want to join the crew club next fall because I\u2019ll be a senior and I want to try an athletic club that\u2019s challenging but rewarding. If someone\u2019s been in the crew club before, is it something that\u2019s manageable with 4 classes and possible an internship? What\u2019s the schedule like for club sports? Never done this before",

Practice times are consistent each season with the exception of the sunday (spring) and saturday swap (fall). \n\nMason Rowing (the d1 varsity team) is a women's only separate entity that rents some space in the same building but otherwise doesn't have anything to do with the crew club.\n\nThe crew club typically has more race travel weekends in the spring than during the fall, some of which will be overnight and limited to the weekend. (very rarely friday afternoon departure). There tend to be around 4-5 races per season.\n\nThe crew club is definitely doable with a load like that. It is preferred to make as many practices as you can consistently, though there have been a few successful members who have been able to come 1-2 a week.",

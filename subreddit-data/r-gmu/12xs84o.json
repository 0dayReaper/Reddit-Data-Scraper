Currently, all meat (besides turkey and pork products) within ALL dining halls (Ike's, Southside, and The Globe) are certified Halal. If a Halal meat isn't on the menu that day, Halal options are available upon request. Additionally, The Mason Mensch Kosher is a cart located at Southside that operates during dinner (6:00 PM - 8:00 PM). It's closed on Saturdays and Sundays. I hope this helps!",

Frankly I\u2019m not even doing to rate which is better because it\u2019s only there for nourishment, fulfilling the Sodexo contract, and giving people jobs.",

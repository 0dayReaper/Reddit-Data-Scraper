    "postText": "Next semester is my last at Mason and I have already finished up my Major and Minor. With that being said, I just need to take an elective class or two in order to fill to the 120 credits I need to graduate. \n\nAre there any classes in particular that anyone would recommend? \n\nThey can be any level  - I would prefer they be on the lighter side in terms of workload (or \u201ceasy\u201d) as I\u2019m planning to be working full time during my last semester. They would also need to be async or online classes as I\u2019m moving out of state for my last semester.\n\nAny help is appreciated! Thanks!",

Lectures are all prerecorded/ asynchronous class no weekly class discussion. All you have to do is watch the recordings and take weekly quiz which is open notes untimed anddddddd no exam. To top things off, you just have to write one paper that you do in pieces throughout the semester. I meannnnn idk what more you can ask. But if you get Dr. Gray she basically doesn\u2019t grade, just gives you points for completion but your real grades come from the lecture quizzes. There are usually just 3/4 videos per week but most are like 8 mins long the longest was just two videos at 20mins\u2026. ANYWAYS yeah pretty chill class and easy going if you find this stuff interesting then it will be a fairly easy class most of it is logical common sense.",

I guess it\u2019s because we are an open campus and anyone could get on it, so they added cameras virtually every single corner to be able to monitor it effectively in case something happens. I would be surprised if you can find a spot that doesn\u2019t have cameras lol.",

You guys are fine.\n\nMy favorite question I asked at a board (directors whatever) meeting was \u201cDid you consider building something for students before tearing down rows of apartments on campus? We already have a housing issue\u2026 there won\u2019t be guaranteed housing for undergrads \u201c \u2026 and look where we are now, sophomores are even at risk.\n\nEdit: continuance of that conversation. The answer was an outright \u201cno\u201d, with a look of shock and \u201coh shit\u201d. There are many administrative positions on this campus and god only knows what the hell they actually do. Best part is when asked in a professional atmosphere, there isn\u2019t a clear answer and things got aggressive once.",

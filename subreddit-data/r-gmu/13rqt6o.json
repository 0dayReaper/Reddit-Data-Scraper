    "postText": "Hello , \n\nHope everyone is having a good summer. I am currently pursuing a Business Major with a Concentration in Business Analytics. I have recently switched from Communications and I am a transfer student who just competed the first semester of junior year . \n\nI do know my main goal is to get a master\u2019s and be able to teach at a university overseas ( either China, SE Asia  or South America ) . Based on research , I would only need a master\u2019s and maybe while pursuing a PhD I can still teach at overseas Universities. \n\nMy goal is not to be a school teacher but a Professor at a university. Just like some Professors  here at GMU , I think I can teach after I get my masters . \n\nI do know that GMU has an above average acceptance rate in both admissions and graduate programs. \n\nMy question is : will it be too unrealistic to continue my Business Analytics major knowing I need to concentrate my graduate program on TESOL ? \n\nI do not seek to teach at the most prestigious university but I do plan to have necessary skills to either Teach English as a Second Language or Something Technology/ Marketing related in my future University career. \n\nI do not want to drop the Business Analytics major since I do know it is very helpful since it would be a great second option if I do not pursue a masters. \n\nThank you and sorry for the possible confusion. \n\nOnce again, my main goal is to be a University Professor and work overseas.",

            "comment": "No. I've had friends teach at universities without any degree in the US, just the fact that they spoke English was enough. Sure, if you wish to be professor at the top university in Argentina or China, you will need the credentials, but those places operate in a who-you-know systems, so do your undergrad in whatever else you want, and then take the TESOL certification or whatever minor certificate they will ask of you, but teaching English abroad is one of those careers where having a degree in \"teaching English as a second language\" will not make a difference. English speakers are needed in every country.",

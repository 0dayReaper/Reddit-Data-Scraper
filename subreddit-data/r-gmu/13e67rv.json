    "postText": "Hi all I\u2019m a senior in highschool committed to GMU for systems engineering. Im planning on getting my concentration in financial engineering or operations research. Can I get some info about career outcomes and internships during college? I\u2019ve looked at the website just want to see what y\u2019all say! Also I\u2019m wondering what classes should I take if I want to work in fintech with my systems engineering degree. ex. SYST 130 vs CS 112 first year and so on. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Graduated GMU in SE, concentrated in Data Analytics. Pretty good GPA, no internships (just basic jobs to pay for college, at least until COVID happened). Got an offer in my last semester to work in the defense contracting realm. Honestly, it\u2019s pretty good. Most companies pay for your clearance, and the pay is higher than other entry level positions (close to 6 figures). Not really sure about the financial engineering route, but SE gives you a really broad career outlook depending on how you want to play your cards, making it a pretty safe major to have.",

            "comment": "I enjoyed doing Systems at GMU, it definitely gives you a pretty good variety of skills. I think the way they have the senior capstone project set up can give you really great experience depending on how much effort you and your team are willing to put into it. For me personally, I think the experience I gained on that project was probably the most compelling thing on my resume. It is just as valuable as an internship. There are a number of contractors who regularly pick up Systems people from Mason, but you may not always find that the jobs are the \"true\" model based systems engineering (MBSE) that we are taught. You may find it more challenging to find that type of systems engineering on the finance side, but I can't say for sure.",

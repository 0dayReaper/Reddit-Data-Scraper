    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all, I am currently in a really bad situation. This past weekend when returning from VA I found out my mother had lost her job and that I had to drive her many states away to rehab. I am currently financially alone and working a low wage serving job in my home state. My friend from a few years ago at GMU messaged me saying he had a room off campus that is 450 a month plus 50-80 a month in utilities, and this is 5-10,000 dollars cheaper than my current housing assignment. This has happened just this weekend and I am just finding out that I am in a severely negative financial situation. I already have student loans and will be facing this year independently while an out of state student. Currently I am faced with many responsibilities and am losing things such as my health insurance. \n\nDoes anyone have any information about how I may be able to get out of my agreement due to this situation? This would tremendously benefit my financial situation and this individual in my life is offering me help to alleviate my financial burden. Thank you.",

            "comment": "OP I am so sorry this is happening to you. I truly hope you can get out of your contract and also eventually get into a better situation. None of this is your fault.\n\nHere is the place to start. [https://housing.gmu.edu/apply/cancellations#:\\~:text=To%20submit%20a%20release%2C%20you,and%20third%2Dparty%20supporting%20documentation](https://housing.gmu.edu/apply/cancellations#:~:text=To%20submit%20a%20release%2C%20you,and%20third%2Dparty%20supporting%20documentation).\n\nIn rare cases, a student encounters an extreme, unforeseeable, and uncontrollable problem that interferes with the ability to continue living at Mason, and Housing can't provide a reasonable solution or alternative campus housing. Emergency issues might be medical, psychological, and/or financial.\n\nYou can submit a housing release request to the Housing office. To submit a release, you must complete the Housing Agreement Release Form located on the Mason housing portal and upload supporting documentation. All release requests should display a change in circumstance since the signing of your Housing and Dining Agreement and third-party supporting documentation. Incomplete release requests will not be reviewed or accepted. The supporting documentation depends on the reason(s) for your release request.\n\nRequests must be submitted by November 1st for Fall release requests",

            "comment": "OP, this doesn\u2019t have much to do with GMU, but I would look at your local social services department for assistance. You can fill out forms online on their website or talk to a person to see if you qualify for financial or emergency services such as emergency SNAP or Medicaid. Or if they know of any assistance you can get. I\u2019m not sure if this will help but major cities also have Community Service Boards that have links to mental health and other services (just google your town plus community service board). Look at food pantries in your area, generally major cities have them and you can get food a certain amount of times a month. There are so many resources out there that people don\u2019t know about or don\u2019t think to ask. Good luck!",

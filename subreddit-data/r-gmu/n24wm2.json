Between the accelerated pace of important material and professors who didnt convert to online well (forcing me to teach myself outside of class attendance) i have barely scraped by. I have recorded every lecture since, in the schools genius, gave teachers the ability to block the download option on recorded lectures, so that i can re-study the entire semester over the summer \n\nCovid may be a great reason for professors to take some pity, but a mechanical device malfunctioning in my future potentially causing harm cant be explained away by \u201cthat lecture was online\u201d",

I understand that quality of education dropped and prices rose, and trust me I know how annoying the price increases are.\n\nIt is also extremely frustrating to never receive a break throughout the semester. \n\nThe lack of reading days is also very stressful. \n\nHowever, this is my hot take. The idea \"Mason fucked us over\" I feel like is pointing a finger at the wrong person/entity. I feel like each decision mason made was educated and calculated, they worked to secure public safety. If me facing extra stress is what comes from it, I cannot fault their decision. \n\nQuite honestly I feel like this all happened because there is a systematic problem with how this country, and various others, handled this pandemic. If we want to point fingers then we should look at ourselves and determine how to fight mis-information and determine how to handle these situations better. That's just my take. \n\nJust my take though",

Additionally compared to what the estimate of tuition increase applied to the state it has been reported to be lower than expected. If the price jump was put into Cabrera's pocket then I can see where you're coming from, but I think a lot of students have been asking for better administration, better support services, and better facilities. If you have evidence to show the contrary please let me know. \n\nI do know price increases have a historic relation to enforcing systemic racial and class segregation, but GMU's diversity is still well funded and well developed. \n\nAdditionally, I understand my language may give off the appearance that high prices are minor inconveniences, but to be quite frank I've had to sell my car, I'm busting my ass working part time, and taking out crazy amount of loans to make end meets. But college isn't cheap but I don't wanna work a job that's gonna keep breaking my back.",

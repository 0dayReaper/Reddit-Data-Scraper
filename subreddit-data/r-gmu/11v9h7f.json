If you're considering a program where the expected salary payoff is a lot higher (IT , CS, Cyber, engineering etc.) maybe that could narrow the price gap. VT is also known for a better on-campus experience vs. GMU.   \n\n$56k is a ton of money though and a big hit to take when you're young. It could end up being more if you pay interest on student loans or take more than 4 years to graduate (5 is pretty common with more difficult programs).",

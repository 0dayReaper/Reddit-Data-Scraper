And I didn\u2019t go to the islands because gmu doesnt do study abroad there, its in Thessaloniki which is a port city. The people that went said it very cold and it even snowed so there were no tourists or places open. If you really wanna go, itd say go on your own during april right before the tourists arrive and its packed and right before the heat starts to pick up. Honestly, go to other islands. You will probably have a better time there, less tourists for the same views. Greece has many islands that are amazing, transportation might be a problem so you really gotta plan ahead in greece. \n\nOn another note, unless your major isnt business or some sort of computer science I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.  The school that partners with gmu is ACT, and they offer very limited classes and most of their classes fall under those categories. I also wouldn\u2019t go if you are already finished with your core classes, gmu doesnt like it when you take upper level courses abroad",

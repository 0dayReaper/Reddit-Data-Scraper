I was never cited until I illegally parked on campus, left car at 30 minute parking, stayed for a class which was about 2 hourish then got back. Got a ticket for expired registration, and for parking. \n\nTLDR: they won\u2019t stop/ring you up just for that. it will more than likely be a seperate citation if you did something ELSE.",

The only thing you'll get cited for on campus is speeding, parking over the allowed limit, or parking in a location you shouldn't be parking. And what do you mean \"parking on public roads I find tickets for not being registered.\" \n\nAlso what's up with your car, is it a bad cat or CEL?",

Also if I were you, I'd do the cheapest thing first, which is buy some cat cleaner fuel additive to see if that fixes it, if it doesn't take out the oxygen sensors and soak them in Brake cleaner or Toilet bowl cleaner, if that doesn't work, might be that time for your cats, but that's so early for a depletion of materials, 135k definitely makes me think its sensors",

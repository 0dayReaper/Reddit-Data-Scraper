Across from beacon hall is a big building which is basically an auditorium where shows and events for the area are hosted frequently. The building is half gmu, half not, and as far as I know; that parking lot is completely free use for the public. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s suspicious to park there when no event is going on, but I also don\u2019t believe it requires a pass.",

Otherwise, a general permit is required the same permit that is also valid in the general lot at Fairfax. There\u2019s also daily Parking via ParkMobile. Regarding the Freedom  Center it is not available to Mason students like the RAC and the aquatic center is at Fairfax.",

You just show them your gmu ID and they give you a pass. Only when registered, so summers and winters with no classes your registration is void",

    "postText": "I found a smartphone sitting on the ground between the hub and south side. It doesn't have any identifying markings, and I don't know what kind of phone it is, except that it's definitely an apple phone. And it's got text messages from someone named Michael ma on it. It's currently sitting on top of the fire hydrant just outside the hub front entrance or whoever owns it if they want it back.\n\nEDIT: the phone has been returned to its owner",

I've heard some people saying that 12 credits for CS courses is a safe limit and I'm questioning my decision here. Any insight into any of these courses would be great as well.",

That\u2019ll get you charged extra, and coming from a non-CS major, that many classes sounds like it could be too much. \n\nFour lecture a semester plus one or two labs or recitations seems normal. I\u2019m not sure about five lectures though.",

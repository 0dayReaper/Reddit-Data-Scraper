    "postText": "Hi everyone, I'm currently looking for a roommate for the fall 2023-spring 2024 semesters. I've already found a very nice townhouse only a 5-minute walk off campus. I was hoping to see if anyone would be willing to sign for a specific room in the house. The room has 2 windows and it is south-east facing. It's furnished with a twin bed, a desk, and closet space.\n\nI would prefer a roommate who is very clean (as we would be sharing a bathroom) and maybe a girl(? not a huge preference just the bathroom thing). The house will have 2 other people living there, I know one for sure is a guy but there is also an empty room in the basement.  The townhouse really clean and well-kept, and everything is furnished. There's a full kitchen, enough space for everyone to store groceries and food items, as well as a deck and backyard. \n\nFor some house rules, no shoes in the house, everyone is responsible to clean up after themselves, and there is a chore chart. The landlord said that he can do a full year-long lease or a 9-month lease just for the school year.\n\nLet me know if you're interested, please! I'd love to tell you more about myself as well.",

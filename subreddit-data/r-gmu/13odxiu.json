I am totally willing to help y'all avoid hell. I do mean mediocre student tho. I don't know how I graduated or got above a 3.0 but I'll take it. \n\nBut just a general tip for upcoming freshmen, don't take Socrates. It's better to push graduation back a semester or two if it means you get to not deal with him.",

Especially if you have professors who give you fall backs. \n\nThose start adding up over time. Like pretty much every class I've had has had fallbacks like the lowest quiz gets dropped or the lowest two homework count for half as much or the final grade can replace the midterm grades. Or the curve is very generous. \n\nI am not one to deny the fact that I am smart if I was smart. But trust me, I'm an idiot. If pass/fail didn't exist. You can bet your ass my GPA would be a lot lower, covid saved my GPA because I got to take calc 2 and 3 over pass fail",

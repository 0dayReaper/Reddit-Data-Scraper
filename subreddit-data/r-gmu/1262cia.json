The catch is that you\u2019ll have to find a way to keep track of where you are in the videos since they\u2019re \u201cfull courses\u201d crammed in like a 10-20 hr video (generally without time stamps)\n\nI\u2019ve found more success on udemy (they have flash sales all the time).\n100 days of code by Dr. Angela Yu and Tim Buchalka\u2019s learn python are very comprehensive courses that cover basic Databases too.",

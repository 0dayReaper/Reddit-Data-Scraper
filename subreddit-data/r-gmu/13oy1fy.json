In general, the people are nice, the campus is pretty, and the surrounding area (Fairfax City) is a very nice slice of America IMO. I wish you the best of luck with your academics and finding friends. Clubs are a great place to start.",

Sometimes it can be difficult because many Americans can't even imagine a world outside of America which can be very isolating. There are so many cultural phenomena that Americans don't even realize aren't a thing in other countries. That being said, there are tons of clubs on campus where you can meet other international students and there are also Americans who won't be that baffled by your existence! There are lots of different types of people at mason, you just have to put yourself out there a bit to find your people.",

There are plenty of international stores around here, especially 3 large supermarkets (H-Mark, 99 Ranch Market, and Great Wall. to be more specifically Korea, Taiwan, and China) They also have the best prices for produce and meats. If you are interested in cooking at Mason or having great food made inside those markets, This is probably the best place to be. Message me anytime if you need more information.",

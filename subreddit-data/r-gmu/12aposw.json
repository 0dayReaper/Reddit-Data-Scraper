    "postText": "I'm a college senior graduating in May with my degree in Environmental Geology. I've applied for Fall 2023 to the **Earth Systems Science** master's program here at GMU. \n\nI have a couple questions for current graduates students (of any program). Any insight you have to share would be greatly appreciated...  \n\n\n* How long did it take for your decision to arrive?\n   * Was it before or after the application deadline? (my deadline: 4/15/23)  \n\n* How did you find out you were accepted? \n   * Email? Snail-mail? Phone call? Magic white owl carrying a letter?  \n\n* If you received full/partial funding through either a TA or RA position, how did you learn you had gotten it?\n   * did you find out at the same time as your acceptance, or afterwards?  \n\n* If you're coming from out-of-state, did you have to attend an in-person orientation before beginning your first semester?",

I do not remember if this happened at the same time as my acceptance e-mail, or if it was received shortly after.\n\nI believe there was some sort of orientation that happened shortly after the start of the semester. I think I had a scheduling conflict and it couldn't make it, which was not an issue.",

It's unclear right now if your file is stuck with the department or in back-end stuff. Back-end stuff can take longer sometimes if there is funding involved, but that difference isn't usually noticeable by the student.\n\nEven if I knew who you were (or you emailed me directly), I am barred from speaking to you about where I saw your file in the system or what was on it.\n\nSometimes reaching out (nicely) to admissions or your desired advisor and checking in on the status burps the system to get things moving. \"I was hoping to get an update on my status, as I was notified some time ago that it was complete.\" would be a version of that.\n\nSummary: We take a longer time on some files than I think we should, but I don't have any specific answers for you.",

I think the hardest part of the \"purgatory\" for me is just the fact that I don't know *where* I'll be living 4 months from now.\n\nI'll start drafting out an email (a nice one) to send to the admissions team and my desired advisor. Hopefully my fate is decided by the end of this month.",

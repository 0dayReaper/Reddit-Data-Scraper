            "comment": "It\u2019s not huge diff from ordinary CS, but the biggest is that instead of choosing 4 or 5 Senior Electives you would have to take the required SWE courses.In terms of those classes, they are much more Coding based and less theory compared to most 4XX CS classes. So if you really just want to write code instead of solving arithmetic and theory problems then go for it. Only warning is that since it\u2019s more coding based you\u2019ll be investing more time in those classes compared to ordinary CS classes since ,you know by now, that Coding is very time consuming, especially if your unfamiliar with it.",

    "postText": "Hey all, just wanted to spread the word that there will be a hands-on demonstration on 3D scanning in the **3rd Floor West Lounge of the Johnson Center TODAY between 1pm and 3pm**. This is an [event](https://www.gmu.edu/today-mason?trumbaEmbed=view%3Devent%26eventid%3D878238943) hosted by a 3D printing, 3D scanning, and prototype design company called 3D Herndon. Demonstrations will run back-to-back within the event's time frame, so if you're on the Fairfax campus feel free to stop by just for a few minutes this afternoon to see what's going on. Whether you have knowledge of 3D scanning technology or not, it will be a pretty cool learning experience and a nice breather from the finals stress.\n\nIf you're planning to come, bring something small to scan into a 3D model!",

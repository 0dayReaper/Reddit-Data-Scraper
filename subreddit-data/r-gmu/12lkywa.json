    "postText": "Howdy Y\u2019all, I am an incoming first year PhD student and I was wondering if any of you could help me find the GMU Warhammer community. I would love to start making friends and discussing painting tips and tricks with other war gamers and look forward to making some friends.\n\nIf any of y\u2019all are warhammer enthusiasts, do you have any favorite places on campus to hang out and paint miniatures and which local game store is best for my hobby needs?\n\nThanks in advance, I am so excited to meet all of you soon!",

If you are looking for people to play with then I am sure there are potentially people on campus as well, although finding them may be a bit difficult.",

            "comment": "Welcome to Mason! Personally if I wanted to paint minis on campus I would go to the engineering building since the scenery is nice in the spring and fall, or maybe you could go to Fenwick library, but keep away from the first floor, sometimes the alarms go off for hours. 2nd floor exploratory hall is also decent if u like outdoor painting but it\u2019s crowded at times. Or if you\u2019re nearby, Peterson Hall has some comfortable booths that\u2019s out of the way and relatively quiet. Hope you find what you\u2019re looking for.",

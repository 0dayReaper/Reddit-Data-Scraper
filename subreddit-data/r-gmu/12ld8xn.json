    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m taking 498 this fall and all of French\u2019s online sections filled up in like 10 minutes so now i\u2019m debating between Mainkar or Frampton. From what I\u2019ve seen, Mainkar curves exams and seems to have a pretty straightforward class, but Frampton also seems to be a pretty decent choice as well. Do any of you have advice on their experience with either? Will they allow you to pick your group mates since I plan on taking this course with some friends who I know work really well together with me?\n\nThanks in advance y\u2019all and for those of you finishing up this semester, congrats and good luck with finals!",

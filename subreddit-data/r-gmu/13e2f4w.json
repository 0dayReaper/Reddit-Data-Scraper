    "postText": "Hello all, I currently work full time in an office and have been attending classes to get my bachelors degree online. Online has been fine, and there are definitely benefits to the asynchronous schedule, but its not everything I want out of my education. I live about half an hour from Fairfax and have heard good things about George Mason, but would like to know how things are for people that work full time?\n\nMy work schedule is pretty flexible, but it is pretty technical and as such I can't reduce to less than 40 hours. I have been working on a CS degree and would like to continue that route. \n\nIs class scheduling flexible at all at GMU? Are their programs a blend between online and in person, or is it more weight towards one? Part of the reason I am considering the transfer is because I want at least some of my instruction to be in person, and I want to meet people. I have hear GMU is a bit more of a commuter school but this could be a benefit for me. \n\nAll in all, do you guys think it would be a good or bad idea to switch to GMU and continue working full time? Thanks everyone.",

If I were you and I could transfer most/all credits towards the BS IT program, I would prioritize my work and take the online async classes. Hope this helps.",

If you can negotiate with your managers to take the classes I would say go for it. Workload wise I don't think it's been too terrible. It all depends on you, but for me two classes a semester is the sweet spot. I find anymore and I can get overwhelemed, though that's mostly up to you. It's much slower this way, but atleast you get a degree by the end of it.",

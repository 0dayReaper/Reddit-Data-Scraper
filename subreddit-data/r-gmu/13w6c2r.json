GMU summer is comprised of like 5 or 6 different terms within it. Check the course meeting dates that correspond with your section letter (A, B, C, etc) [here](https://registrar.gmu.edu/calendars/fall_2023/).\n\nIf your course truly did start on the 22nd, you should email the registrars office asap, and forward the email to your prof that went unanswered. Hopefully that helps!\n\nEdit: in the copied comment I'm talking abt the 22nd, so just pretend it says 30th lol.",

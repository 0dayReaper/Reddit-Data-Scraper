It's looking like everything was stored unencrypted. Your name, email address, phone number, password, and your school name are all now publicly available *and* tied together, meaning anyone who gets access to that data can now find out quite a lot about you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you used that password (or a variation of it) for *anything* else, change it immediately.",

Does that mean our NetID/patriot pass is \"compromised\" now? Do we need to change the whole thing?",

Change any accounts who have used this password and be wary of unauthorized account recoveries.\n\nIf you don't already, I recommend using a password manager to generate and store unique passwords. Then for extra security, horcrux or salt the most vital passwords. I personally use BitWarden, it's free. This should isolate any breach in the future",

    "postText": "Has anyone heard any information regarding any of the study abroad programs for this summer? I recently applied and got accepted to a study abroad program at mason. They said flight information would be sent out sometime this week &amp; that is basically confirmation that the program is all set. I haven\u2019t heard any information regarding flights but I also haven\u2019t received any news about the program being canceled yet. I\u2019m a little nervous cause I am really looking forward to this. Not sure who else is going on a study abroad trip this summer so I would really just like to chat with someone\n\nThanks!",

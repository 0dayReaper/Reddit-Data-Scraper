    "postText": "Hey everybody. I need some help on this matter that I\u2019ve recently just noticed. I recently got accepted to the fall 2023 BSN program at Mason and decided to pursue my studies at GMU this fall. However, I realize that I\u2019ve made a mistake on my application. I am a permanent Virginia resident, who accidentally overlooked the tuition question part of the application, and marked myself as an out-of-state applicant. I can not afford the out-of-state tuition, nor should it even be necessary to pay it as a Virginia resident. I have already completed financial aid and just received the financial aid notification email from the school, which allowed me to see the mistake Ive made on the application (I\u2019m aware it was my fault but it was a complete accident and I overlooked it like an idiot). I have left an email for the financial aid office just now. For any of those who have experienced the same issue, will the financial aid office convert it to in-state tuition? Please help! Thank you.",

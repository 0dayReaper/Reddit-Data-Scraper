    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nThis is a very niche question, but I am planning to take Math 125 (discrete math) over the summer as a non-degree student at GMU. Right now, the only sections I see available are in person and not online as I was planning to do. The in person section meets 4 days a week for 2 hours. This is simply not feasible for me as I don't have a car and would face about 2 hours in transit back and forth. This class is with Joseph Frias. **My question is how realistic would it be for me to only show up to class on assessment days.** I'm not necessarily worried about learning content on my own, it's more about not hurting my grade by not showing up to most class sessions. Open to any advice, thank you!!",

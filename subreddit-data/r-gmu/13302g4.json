You just have to join clubs that interest you, stick through the uncomfortable small talk, keep going to the club meetings, and finding people to vibe with. Then that will open you up more to their personal friend group. A classmate I have known for three classes through the years always mentioned going skating after class, so I asked to join them and I have been skating with them whenever I can. It is necessary to be vulnerable and open to rejection until it is no big deal, says my therapist. I hope this helps you.",

I can definitely relate that it\u2019s little hard to make friends on campus, but it\u2019s definitely possible! Honestly I feel like the best friendships are the ones you don\u2019t expect. I\u2019ve met a few people at club events, in class, and through other friends. I\u2019d recommend going to any clubs that you like and try to be openminded. You\u2019re more likely to meet people with similar tastes at specific events. Be sure to get there socials/number so you can stay in contact and hang out. Sometimes you\u2019ll need to take the initiative to start or maintain friendships. The same thing goes with people in your classes. You can try asking if you they want to meet up for coffee, study together, or anything along those lines. I hope this help but it\u2019s honestly a process. Most people on campus stay to themselves :/",

            "comment": "Wanting freinds puts u in a paradoxical situation where u sacrifice being ur self to have someone around you. Ultimately because u sacrifice being ur self it makes freindships feel less natural. Try going to clubs to get ur social needs met aka just interacting and having fun . Instead of having going to clubs to get life long freinds. That way u will have control over the situation and get ur needs met as u don\u2019t control how someone else feels about you. And by doing that u are more likely meet people you fit in with and feel naturally close too. As ur hanging out with each other cuz u want too not cuz you feel like u have too. That\u2019s my advice. Also a lot of people struggle with this esp freshman year. It\u2019s so hard seeing everyone have fun and do fun things but not being able to urself. As lonley as it feels u are not alone in experiencing this feeling. So many people felt like this and managed to get freinds. So many people also continued to not get freinds. Challenge ur comfort zone. By trying to change u are more likely to change. U got this. U made it this far with ur life despite the challenges u faced. If u are starting from 0 it can only get better.",

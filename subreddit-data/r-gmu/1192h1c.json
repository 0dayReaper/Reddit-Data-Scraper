Always thought that was pretty bizarre for a university.\n\nI worked at a few different universities for REUs and there was never a time where faculty/staff (including research interns) were made to pay for parking. I work at a college right now and I haven't paid a cent for it in many years.",

We needed our lot resurfaced and instead of having GMU do it, we all did it so we wouldn't put ourselves on the radar of parking. It's absolutely asinine they charge that much to park. If it was in a major city location, I could maybe see it to prevent randos but for a campus where the only possible reason a vehicle would be parked there is some sort of university business is ridiculous. Even if they want to require parking passes, just charge the 2 bucks it takes to print the pass and call it a day. Absolutely ridiculous",

How\nMason operates is the same at UVA, VCU, ODU, JMU, VT, UMD and hundreds of other universities. Parking like Housing and Dining are self funded auxiliaries and\nMust cover nearly $20m in annual expenses which covers transportation, shuttles, maintenance, debt service and operations. Costs are kept at the lowest point to allow the operation to break even which is even more challenging with a 1/3 less people coming to campus.",

Especially for employees but students are paying thousands to attend there and somehow that's not enough to cover parking lots?? Food makes sense, very few places provide free food for their employees. I bet some of that 20M could be reduced by not having 48 parking cops roaming around all day. Debt service isn't the students or employees problem. Maintenance sure, maybe, but what's the difference between maintaining sidewalks and parking lots? Asphalt vs concrete? Gimme a break.",

The fact that a decade later the price is the same while inflation has hit over 9% in the last year is insane. I'm surprised passes aren't $500 per semester by now....",

Rappahannock Deck for instance cost $42m to build. We have about $3m(down from $4m thru budget cuts and reduced staffing) for operations. We have about $2m-$3m in maintenance(paving and garage repairs). Shuttles cost another $4-5m-we have cut back about $1.5m on that. We subsidize the CUE bus so students ride for free. So Parking at Mason like almost every other university looks at its expenses, much of which are fixed, and calculates based on projected permit sales how much needs to be charged to cover expenses. So fiscally we must break even and at the same time, have a wide array of choices for parking starting at $110/semester as well as free off site parking with shuttle connections. While every schools finances will be a bit different based on how much debt it has, our permit fees are pretty much middle of the pack. It\u2019s a balancing act to meet all the needs and keep costs down. We\u2019re happy to meet with anyone and show and talk about all this but trying to provide real facts vs uniformed comments. Overall less than half drive so if the University was even able to pay for all this, it would take away from academic and research programs and the half that don\u2019t drive would have to pay for parking.",

Is it climate controlled or something?  It should not cost $42 million dollars to make some ramps out of girders, rebar, and concrete!  And $70m in mortgages for land?  No land in Fairfax or Manassas goes for that much in the quantities GMU occupies, and certainly not within the time period during which it was purchased.\n\nThis all demonstrates a complete lack of fiscal responsibility.",

Back when Rappahannock was built, average cost per space was around $15k. It\u2019s now around $25k per space above ground and $30k-$50k per space below ground such as Van Metre garage. In todays dollars Rappahannock would cost over $65m. Mason built Rappahannock in 2009, Shenandoah Deck in 2005 and Van Metre in 2010. Bonds are paid off over 20-25 years.\nFYI-For parking lots the average construction cost per space is around $5k. \n\nHere is some industry background info: https://f.hubspotusercontent20.net/hubfs/9476621/2021%20Parking%20Structure%20Cost%20Outlook.pdf",

And that's assuming 100% subterranean construction.  None of GMU's parking decks are completely subterranean, though that would certainly free up more above ground land for development rather than sprawling beyond the university's borders and having to take out mortgages for more land.\n\nSome other cursory search results: [https://www.fixr.com/costs/build-parking-garage](https://www.fixr.com/costs/build-parking-garage)\n\n[https://www.rsmeans.com/model-pages/parking-garage](https://www.rsmeans.com/model-pages/parking-garage)\n\nSo is it that y'all are having problems negotiating with bids on a project for a fair rate or are you giving sweetheart deals to your cronies in whatever corp who assure you that it's a really great rate(tm)?",

Your only other option was street parking up to a 20 min walk from campus.\n\nSchools that charge will justify selling their parking to companies like park mobile because charging to park encourages other modes of travel.",

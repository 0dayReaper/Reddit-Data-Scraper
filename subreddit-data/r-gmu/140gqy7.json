    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m a transfer student at GMU for the Fall 2023 semester. I\u2019m currently on the housing waitlist because I was dumb and wasn\u2019t paying attention to the open date. How likely am I to receive housing by the start of the semester? I\u2019m currently number 5 on the waitlist. Should I start looking into off-campus housing or are my chances good enough to not have to worry?",

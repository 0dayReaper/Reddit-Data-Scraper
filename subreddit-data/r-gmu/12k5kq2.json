    "postText": "Hey guys, just preparing for Fall 2023, I\u2019ve heard and read everything there is to know about FNAN 303 \ud83d\ude05. For the people who have taken it in-person, live online, or async does it really matter the medium? I\u2019ve read so many people say they taught themselves from the test banks, but I\u2019ve read a few who benefitted from asking a teacher. I\u2019m a timid fellow in general, but I\u2019m not scared to ask for help when I need it. \n\nI will appreciate any thoughts, advice, and help y\u2019all give. Thank you in advance!",

Just be mindful theres profs here and i caught one of them myself. \nBut here is the suckiest news:\n\nAll fnan 303 is taught same way no matter who the professor is. Drissi is coordinator in charge and the learning environment doesn\u2019t match mine because it is not enjoyable. I am not disabled, no learning disability. Gmu professors i know only are lazy at teaching and some do not know how or not meant to teach because they brag having a PhD (my experience only).  It is a sad to hear honestly\n\n\nAll tests are online and have to be taken anywhere online for 1hr and 5 minutes time\u2026depending on the timeframe schedule. If ur doing in-person, then test must be taken at the time class starts. Otherwise, online sections have to take it earlier and you will have a calendar to track it\n\nI suggest taking it in-person if you can find Stephen Christophe , or steven pilloff  because they are both very good teachers. What i don\u2019t like with Pilloff is that he teaches same stuff in class that you already watch from recorded lectures at home as part of preparation before coming to class. You end up wasting time and gas and money when you can teach yourself. I think profs should just go over practice problems during class hours. But Drissi told professors teaching Fnan 303 not to do that because they want students to do study by themselves. Also, professors are not allowed to tell you whats on the exam and your study guide is based on 20-pages of test bank problem practice. If i were you, take it in person is my best advice. \nGood luck",

It also depends on how you best like to take courses.\n\nSome courses can be taken in person while other courses can be online (asynchronous, synchronous, or mixture). Some might learn best if courses are taken on campus. You\u2019ll be able to ask questions on the spot and study with other students.\n\nIn the case of FNAN 303, definitely utilize the test banks, lecture and practice problems, videos, and quizzes to study for exams. As of summer 2020, exams might be taken using lockdown browser with webcam.\n\nBack in spring 2020, students got to take exams without webcam due to covid. This meant that all students bypassed this restriction by doing exam work for exams 2 to final on other computers while taking exams on main computer.\n\nI sort of get the idea that GMU\u2019s raising the standards very high after covid. I\u2019m sure other courses are using lockdown browser with webcam in other courses if students want to take quizzes and exams at home.\n\nLockdown browser with webcam\u2019s like a form of mental illness designed to make students setup for failing. There might be headlines where schools are either abolishing assessment altogether or abolishing exam software.",

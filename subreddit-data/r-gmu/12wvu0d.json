            "comment": "Last summer, I attended a two week course in Front Royal immediately after exams ended. I highly recommend it! \n\nWhile it wasn\u2019t the high school intro program, it was similar, with a focus on skill building not specialization. The course work was very reasonable and always engaging. The campus is very nice, especially the dorms (which, depending on how many attend, may be singles) and the dining hall (it\u2019s small enough that the staff will ask what you want for lunch, lol). \n\nThe facility is operated by the federal government. Depending on the duration of your program they may run a background check on you, but it wasn\u2019t necessary for me. If you have a car, bring it. The campus is isolated, about two miles off a long road out of Front Royal. Since endangered animals live there (some even extinct in the wild) the gate is permanently manned. When I arrived for the first time, I had to press the exterior call box and give my name and info so they could verify my identity. When they let me in, I approached an interior gate with a guard who took down my license plate for future identification. This is the process to get into and out of the Smithsonian Mason campus. There are also restricted areas within the campus (like grounds where wolves are kept), some even that my instructors needed permission to access, but the main cluster of buildings is unrestricted. \n\nThe town has some good places to eat (try spelunkers if you like burgers) as well as a grocery store and outdoor gear shop, but the selection is much more sparse compared to Fairfax. I furnished my room with some items from the local thrift store actually. \n\nThe rooms are very nice. They have private bathrooms and showers (essential when doing field work). They come with a mini fridge though it\u2019s not very large. There are two beds but everyone chose single rooms. Laundry is communal and included. There\u2019s also a nice common room with puzzles, books and a switch (it has like Mario kart and Zelda on it). \n\nSome activities can be done in the classroom, mainly data analysis and mapping. There is also a lab; we mainly used it to identify plants and insects found in the field. Other course work can be done on campus: setting camera traps at the pond, invertebrate, fish and amphibian sampling in the stream, plant surveys on racetrack hill, insect sampling in the meadows and radiotelemetry in the hills. About half of time during my program, the class went to locations off campus. We saw bird banding and Kestrel rehabilitation at the Clifton institute, hiked a trail in Shenandoah national park and monitored a stream and wetland at the Leopold preserve. Additionally, we arranged a kayaking day on the Shenandoah river and that was a lot of fun. \n\nBest of luck if you decide to do it. I had a blast and I hope you do too.",

    "postText": "Good Evening,\n\nMy friend, an F-1 Masters in CS, failed in two course (one in his first semester, and one now). He missed a C in the course by 3 marks. This was mainly due to a late submission of a project on BB( caused by an internet issue on that day), which he missed by 45 mins which resulted in him getting a [0. In](https://0.In) this particular subject the submission link for the projects expire exactly at 11:59 PM.He mailed the professor the submission and explained his situation. The professor told him that thy could not doing anything as the submission was not on BB. Now fast forward a few months, his final exam didn't go too well, and he ended up getting an F (second one). He again mailed the professor telling them that he missed the C grade by only 3 marks and if they would consider the submission. The professor replied with the same reason as she did before, telling him that since his submission was not on BB they could not do anything. What can my friend do now as I heard that failing in two courses as an F1 student means that you have to return to your country?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr: My friend, an F1 student, failed in two courses and is now facing a termination of his masters degree. What can he do now?",

Unfortunately, we all have challenges with internet failure \ud83d\ude1e, for that reason I personally avoid submitting paperwork an hour before due date. It is a risk for us as students and for professors as well. \nNow, if he remembers the exactly day and time, reach to the GMU IT support and see if that day they have any problems with the blackboard system. If they do , they can email to you and attach to the email and submit the dean and Cc professor",

Unfortunately the higher up you go in courses, the harder the profs seem to get. Hopefully he can somehow get that grade up to where it needs to be, good luck!",

So they had to have not been doing well in the class in the first place. It sucks about the internet issues, but if you know that there are issues, you don\u2019t leave it to chance and you submit your work with hours or days to spare. Work with reality and don\u2019t assume you will get a free pass if you try it the same way and it fails again. You aren\u2019t owed a break just because you asked for one. Hopefully the friend learns their lesson and uploads their assignments the day before or hours earlier before the due date.\n\nIf it was a timed exam that cut off halfway through due to internet issues, I might see a professor letting them retake it. But not an assignment to be uploaded at their leisure (before the due date, anyways). Or if they could show the Professor steps they took to try and fix the problem (especially the same Professor!).",

Galaxy Hut in Arlington used to put on shows and has said they're looking to start doing that again soon.\n\nMetro Gallery (240 capacity) in Baltimore also has a lot of good metal shows, and you can take the Amtrak from DC to the BWI stop for like $10 and it gets you there in 20 min, the venue is about a block and a half from the station. Baltimore Soundstage (1000 cap) and Ottobar (350 cap) also have a lot of metal shows that come through.\n\nOther venues that aren't mainly metal but do a metal show every once in a while are Black Cat (800 cap), DC9 (250 cap), Fillmore Silver Spring (1100 cap), and Jiffy Lube Live (25k cap, outdoor)",

If your looking for big name bands you\u2019ll wanna head over to The Fillmore in silver spring, soundstage in Baltimore and the 9:30 club in DC. Scene is starting to pick back up and you\u2019ll start seeing familiar faces after a going to a few. Smaller shows will require you to either know someone on the inside or organizers will give you a the address via dm if your lucky.",

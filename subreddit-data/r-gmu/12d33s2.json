    "postText": "I need to satisfy the IT requirement for Mason core  and I was wondering how easy CS 112 would be for someone with previous coding experience. I took Comp Sci A in high school and only got a three unfortunately, but have been coding a lot recently. Likewise, I know this class is in Python instead of Java which is the source of my curiosity on the difficulty of the class.",

            "comment": "It's a pretty class tbh. A lot of the ideas of java cross over to python, and in my opinion, python is a much easier language to learn.\n\nYou see a lot of people complaining about it on here since it's required for **all** engineers, regardless of if they are CS/CYSE/CE.",

As with any programming class, start the projects early and you'll be good.\n\nIn 112 we did our work on zybooks - which was a great application for learning python imo",

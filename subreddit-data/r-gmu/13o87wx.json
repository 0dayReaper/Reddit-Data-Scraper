Definitely have a different instructor, atleast as a buffer of his bs.\n\nHe'd consistently send emails to the wrong class sections, and he'd ignore all student email. I'm currently collecting screenshots to file a grievance against him.",

Exams are huge for the course. Exam problems are the same as the test banks problems. Essentially just with different numbers. Good Luck",

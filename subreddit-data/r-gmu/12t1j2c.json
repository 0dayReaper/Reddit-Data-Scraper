Do any of you guys have recommendations on where to live or any apartment complexes to stay away from? I don\u2019t want my drive to class being over 40 mins (not considering traffic).",

            "comment": "Fair lakes area is great. it is a little cheaper than inside Fairfax and quick drive because it is north/south not east/west, you can just take 286 to the GMU exit. I used to live at the Camden at Fair Lakes. Some of my friends lived at the Windsor.... And I forget the name of the apartment complex but it is gated and on the other side of Fairfax Towne Center. There are a lot of options. Also look at Chantilly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I lived there my commute was so quick no matter the time of day, because I wasn't going on high traffic routes. I took short roads like Shirley Gate Road and Monument to get home, whilst everyone else was going east/west on 29 and 66.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*EDIT\\* Unfortunately it ALL is going to be expensive. That's just the way it is, unless you are trying to live in a room advertised for rent in somebody's house off craigslist or pinned up at the supermarket posterboard, which I have known people to do in this area.",

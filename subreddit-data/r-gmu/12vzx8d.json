I\u2019m sure there more ideas too, it would probably make sense to have a specific board or group of people focusing entirely on that",

If we were all smart then wouldn\u2019t we all be at a top school?

Your club sport is the equivalent of ITT Tech, not an accredited university with a great law program. No recruiters are beating down the doors of ITT Tech grads, just like no spectators are clamoring to watch you clowns.",

Due to COVID a large amount of recruits fell through the cracks, leaving them at places like GMU to only pursue academics. We have multiple players that could easily play on the most high end D3 teams and 3-4 players that could be legimate FCS D1 prospects should they choose to pursue that route.\n\nIf it were the case that we were worse than high school level teams then it would make no sense for so many high school staffs to want to come here to coach. We recently hired an entire high school staff who is choosing to be here knowing they may not get paid at all. Now I will say not all club football teams are to our level, but our team is no joke.\n\nIn the same way that D3 football, NCAA sanctioned league, is not considered good enough, GMU, an accredited institution, is extremely often viewed in the same light, yet here we are. You and I could both likely have gone to better academic schools, but we chose GMU for whatever reason it may be. \n\n2.9% of all high school football players go on to play D1 football. That still leaves a very talented pool left over of athletes. Recruiting is political and based on connections. It is very easy to fall through the cracks or not be seen. A lot of guys on our team are great examples of that. \n\nHopefully we are able to see you at a game this Fall so your mind can be changed. We are primed for our best season in our clubs history",

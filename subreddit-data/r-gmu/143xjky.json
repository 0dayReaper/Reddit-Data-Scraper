I\u2019m also new to this major but so far it has been pretty interesting. Logic class was super boring as it involved a lot of weird/stupid math. Overall you should expect to be flooded with lots and lots of readings and lots of short essays. If you enjoy reading and writing then it should be a piece of cake.",

And philosophy students get asked this question ad nauseam. \nPeople forget or not realize that the entire enterprise of philosophy is logical analysis. Broadly speaking, it is a degree in which it can be applied to any area that is in need of analysis. As someone mentioned, the most popular undergrad degree for law students is philosophy. \nAlso, people can study what they want and what fulfills them. Not all learning has to be quantified by monetary considerations.",

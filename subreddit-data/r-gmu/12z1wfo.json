I didn\u2019t see it happen but my front quarter panel, bumper, and driver side headlight is damaged. They didn\u2019t leave a note or anything. I drive a white mazda3. If anyone saw anything, please reach out to me. It happened between 7 am and 2 pm. Thank you",

Maybe look for white paint on another car or look at the paint left on your vehicle. Personally, I would wait till next Monday or Wednesday since they probably have class during during the time you said it happened.\n\nRemember, take pictures of the license plate and damage to your and the other persons car and report it to Mason pd for a hit and run.",

I reccomend everyone gets a dashcam, sure they can be expensive at first, but it will protect your investment and sometimes pay for itself if you find yourself in an unfortunate event\n\nOPs best case is requesting camera access for insurance purposes as theyd like to see proof or something. But seriously, people need dash cams. One thing OP could do is try to determine the color of the car based on the color scraped onto their paint amd try to find any cars that have scrapes matched to that color.",

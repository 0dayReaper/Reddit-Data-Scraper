    "postText": "Hey guys, so I'm a sophomore and I'm getting burnt out with comp sci. I looked into Systems and found it pretty interesting but I'd like some advice on what I should do. Just for some background, I got through calc 2 with a B, and barely passed CS 211 this semester. I can transfer most of my credits over which is why I'm seriously considering this. Also, any systems engineering majors mind chiming in on their experience at gmu so far? thanks a ton",

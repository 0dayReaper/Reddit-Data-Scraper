    "postText": "I have taken the same class 3 times and have failed it every time. I know that isn't a good thing so plzzz don't make me feel any worse about it. Does anyone have any advice on what I should do next? It is a required course for graduation (ENGH 302) so I need to be able to take it and pass. I already have an appointment with my academic advisor this week and I will discuss further with them but wanted to try here in the meantime. Any and all constructive feedback is welcome. Thanks!\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much to everyone who commented with solutions and helpful feedback. Also thank you for the reassurance that every things going to be okay, it is much appreciated &lt;3. I met with my academic advisor earlier today and we were able to create a plan for me to request to retake it sometime next year and actually pass it this time lol. 4th times a charm :P",

I highly recommend doing the best you can in the course for the remainder of the semester to make a good case for yourself. On a side note, we are not our grades, so don't be too hard on yourself. I hope everything works out for you.",

She\u2019s really sweet and she makes the class really manageable by being so flexible with due dates. That being said, you still NEED to do all the major assignments as I believe that is the department requirements for the class. Idk what your major is but Im doing electrical engineering which is a hard major that I have to spend a lot of time on but I still forced myself to set aside time for 302. You definitely need to reevaluate how you\u2019re approaching your course work though. You should\u2019ve had a serious wake up call the second time you failed the class and sorry if this makes you feel worse, but at a certain point you may need to ask yourself if college is for you or if your major is for you.",

English is one of the subjects I dislike the most because of the writing/reading. Highly recommend her. But like others have said this is arguably one of the easiest courses at GMU, so definitely think about what caused you to fail this class. If English is a second language, GMU has resources like the writing center to look over your papers. I feel the only way you can seriously fail is plagiarism, not turning in assignments, or clear lack of effort.",

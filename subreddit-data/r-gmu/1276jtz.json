    "postText": "I'm not crashing and burning (yet) but I want to get a good idea if I should switch or not before I go too much further. For context...  \n\n\nI am a Freshman doing CYSE. I had to start the math portion behind, first by doing the online algebra tutorial over the summer and then precalc last semester. I've been giving calc 1 my all, and currently have an 84 after the first test and Hwks/Recitations up to this point. It's of course not fun, and I've had to spend many, many hours in the math center just to get the Hwks done.    \n\n\nI'm confident I will pass Calc 1, especially as my other classes are a breeze (CYSE 101, ENGR 107, and CS 112 as I took CYSE 130 last semester, which is another intro to python class). I am however absolutely terrified for the Calc 2 &amp; Physics storm next semester, and don't want to set myself up to fail those classes when I'm already a bit behind the typical plan, and am not sure how well I'd be doing in calc if I had less time to work on it.   \n\n\nIf I switch to IT with a concentration in CYSEC, I won't have to worry so much about the math, which sounds great but... what's the tradeoff? I'm not too worried about earning a bit less in early jobs, but how's the field different as an IT major versus CYSE? Am I correct in saying CYSE will be creating secure systems while IT will be more focused in policy and analysis?",

At the end of the day, if you pioneer in-demand skills the money will come.  In a nutshell I would argue that the CYSE curriculum opens you up to a wider band of career opportunities that are highly relevant in the local job market. Also my comment from a similar post:\n\n&gt;I'm an alumni (BIS) with about 8 years of professional work experience. I have a inflated software engineering title but I'm really more of a typical devops/IT/security jack-of-trades guy with strengths in some popular areas (automation, security, software delivery).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I got pretty far into the local GovCon IT industry before finishing my degree. I'm pretty happy with my career but have a lot of regrets about how I didn't finish an engineering degree. Degrees like EE, CS, or CYSE give you a strong foundation to do a lot of interesting work. I'm very limited to a lot of \"typical\" out-of-the-box IT/Software crap. The local defense/intel/gov job market has a lot of very applications relevant to those degrees such as:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\-Working on integrated systems where you need fast-executing code and to generally be able to interface with hardware (i.e. not just Python but strong C++).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\-Data science programs where you need the advanced math, algorithms, etc.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\-Cyber roles that use hardware, RF etc. (there is so much more to hacking than sitting on Linux, SDR skills (software defined radios) are in big demand.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My only advice is to not let tough math or CS classes restrict your imagination and the types of roles you can pursue. While they are all great degrees, it's a lot easier to move from a CS heavy job role to an IT role rather than vise-versa.",

Don't ever fucking give up because you will regret it more that you went the easy route for undergrad and have to go the hard route later than to go hard route as an undergrad and then go easy route later. \n\nIE: I am trying to do an online CS program and finding myself limited from good online CS programs like GA Tech, UT Austin, Penn or Stanford because alot of them require calc and some 200 to 300 level CS classes at GMU. Though, my GPA is quite shit too (low 3.0) so I cannot blame the IT program for that.",

If I could go back, I would have just sucked up the math classes for CS and skipped the grad degree. But like others noted, it's easy to go from CS to IT. Not the other way around.\n\nMy advice would be to stick with the CYSE program. You can always switch down to IT if you really feel like your burnt out. But the fact that your willing to put in the work is the most important factor. You'll be able to overcome Calc 2 and physics, just put the work in and youll be done in no time. I'm surprised this semester is almost over - its been going by fast.\n\nBut yes, IT CYBR is really policy/framework focused. Lots of mind numbing, basic cyber policies.",

I think the IT route is better if you want to avoid the math/science requirements. Some of the cyber classes are similar, but you'll probably have more hands-on cyber experience through the CYSE program. In reality, HRs are just gunna check off that your pursuing a STEM/Cyber degree.",

Security Engineer at Fed Contractor for about a year now and I graduate this May (IT Cyber concentration) I have actually worked with capstone projects in the CYSE program as part of my job, and that program is miles ahead of educating on security than the IT cyber concentration is. A lot of hands on and practical knowledge about applying security, whereas an IT degree educates you more about how systems work and communicate. More foundational knowledge with IT that still opens a lot of doors; CYSE path will probably get you more \u201cboxes checked\u201d from a security tooling and process context that will look really good on resumes.",

I had someone who is a CYSE student work in the same job position/role as me. Nonetheless, I like how broad the IT major is because it exposes you to various areas of IT then you get to pick what you are interested in such as networking, database/programming, cybersecurity, and health information technology. Because of this, you aren\u2019t limited and can choose which area(s) best suits you. With this being said, I would say choose what\u2019s good for your mental health and well-being.

Why the fuck would you ever put yourself through the bullshit CS and CYSE majors do for the sake of potentially have a job that just might if they\u2019re lucky pay them a little bit more than an IT major. CS and CYSE falls under IT so we\u2019re basically the superior majors. Software developers which is what most of these \u201cambitious\u201d CS majors think they are , are gonna be working in IT departments. They get commanded around by IT project managers and IT directors. Save yourself the hassle and just do IT man.",

From my experience, a lot of them go into IT because they failed CS 211 or 310. I only ever met ONE person who came into the IT program from CS because they couldn't do the math.\n\nAnd lastly, anyone will hire you as a software dev, cyber related engineer,  etc whether you did cyse or cs. In fact, I think one could argue that more employers would probably prefer a cs degree over a cyse degree even for a cyber engineering related role. And this is because the CYSE program for GMU may have credibility in the dmv but if you go further from here, they probably never heard of gmu, much less know there is a major called cyse.",

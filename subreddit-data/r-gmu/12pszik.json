    "postText": "Buying a new Switch and was curious to see if anyone wanted a used one. Functions just fine, haven\u2019t had any problems. I did customize the joycons a bit, not the stock colors. The right stick drifts, but the left stick is fine. The kickstand is broken off, no clue where it is. Screen is relatively clean besides a few smudges. Everything in the original box is included: dock, cables, joycon grip, the console lol. Comes with a 215gb sd card, but turns out to be a lie and holds around 64gb. You\u2019ll know when you\u2019ve hit the limit when stuff stops downloading properly\n\nPricing? I\u2019m willing to negotiate, around $200-230ish range, we\u2019ll work something out. hit me up about any questions you might have\n\nThanks in advance!",

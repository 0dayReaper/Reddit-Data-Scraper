    "postText": "GMU got the worst elevators in almost every building (especially JC, the only thing slower than JC\u2019s WiFi is JC\u2019s elevator, and the elevator always broken). We need the university spend the money to repair the elevator (like the one in Horizon and library) instead of doing sidewalk construction.",

The Rapp deck elevators scare the hell out of me, like the move down when the doors are open, That's not normal. Wtf was wrong with the sidewalk for them to even reconstruct in the first place? \n\nThe parking decks have foundational cracking, but the sidewalk is more important? Talk about mismanagement of funding.",

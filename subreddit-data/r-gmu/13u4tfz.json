    "postText": "For those who saw my last post, I\u2019d like to give a few updates\n1. Yes i\u2019m a CS student\n2. I found him\nI was walking to my first hour class when i felt a slight breeze on my behind. I was wearing my tight adidas track pants so I don\u2019t know how I possibly could have, so i realized he was back. This time it was in a public setting, so I knew if I looked behind me he\u2019d be there. So that\u2019s exactly what I did. I turned around and saw a tall, black haired, latino person standing right behind me wearing a blue t shirt. I finally stood up for myself when I told him to stop touching me there without consent because I was starting to not like it anymore. He denied this and said he \u201cNever even touched yo stank ass\u201d and he proceeded to try and gas light me by saying my crack was showing but I caught him red handed, why would I believe him? If you see this individual of this description please stay away.",

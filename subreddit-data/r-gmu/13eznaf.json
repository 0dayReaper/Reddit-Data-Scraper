            "comment": "I had him for CS 321 last Fall. Was not a good experience unfortunately, although I'd chalk that up to CS 321 being terrible. I hear they're looking to change up how it's run but my experience was learning a bunch of theory and history on software development, then also told to make a web or mobile application with 0 instruction on any actual tools you would use to make a web or mobile application. It taught me the differences between waterfall and agile development, but not a lick of JavaScript. Anyways as for Masri, it seems students tend to not like him as he only explains things once and can be harsh at times, but I can appreciate him as he's organized, knows the material well and he listens to student feedback. I've had far worse professors at GMU but also a few better professors.",

I did read on some other posts on here that you have a choice on how easy/hard you want the project to be and he has listed a few resources one can use in his syllabus so my plan for the next week is definitely using those and learning as much as I can before class starts.",

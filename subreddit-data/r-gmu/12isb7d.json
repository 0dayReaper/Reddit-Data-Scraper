When I found out about the baskets yesterday I brought a few disc in today and me and some coworkers were playing on our lunch break. The manager came by and was asking how I liked the basket placement etc. he said these two baskets are a test run to see how many people use them. And that they\u2019d like to put a full course in, most likely on west campus, if it seems like people will use it. I love the idea. And I hope there are plenty of other people such as yourself that will benefit/ enjoy it.",

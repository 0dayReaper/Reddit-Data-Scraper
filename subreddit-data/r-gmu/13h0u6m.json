If you take it in the fall, for some assignments you have up to three weeks whereas in the summer it can have weekly due dates. \nAs of now the course is still in PHP and the change to JS may take a couple years for them to implement so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about that. Python is still more similar to php/js than java is regardless.",

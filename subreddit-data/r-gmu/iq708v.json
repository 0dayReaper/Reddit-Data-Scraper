Must of this work is abstracted away so you can have a better online experience. \n\nOf course, why should they even try if they get ungrateful responses like this.",

I have a weekly class on Zoom and my professor puts us in breakout groups and lets us talk about the class together for 2 hours with literally zero direction. She tells us to just discuss upcoming assignments and projects. I\u2019m paying over $2000 for this class and am being taught nothing whatsoever. Maybe you are fortunate enough to have better professors, but stop making excuses for shitty professors. I am not having a seamless online experience. This is a dumpster fire.",

Not saying they should make everything P/F but at least *try* to take some of the load off the students.",

Have you asked them exactly how much they\u2019re doing? I have. That\u2019s how I know.\n\nOnline learning is hard. Many of them don\u2019t realize that these online alternatives are actually more stressful to the students than the in-person ones. It\u2019s hard to know how the students feel and how long they take on these new assignments that they just created this one semester. So talk to them! \n\nWe\u2019re just all trying to get by in these weird times.",

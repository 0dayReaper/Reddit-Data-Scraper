    "postText": "Last semester I took BUS 210 with Dr. Cheema and I had a B almost the whole semester and then I got an F on the final and my grade dropped significantly. This semester I was sure I would fail BUS 310 because I remember Dr. Cheema saying that BUS 310 is considerably harder than BUS 210. This semester I first joined Dr. Cheema\u2019s BUS 310 class, then I switched to another professor. After a friend\u2019s recommendation, I switched for a third time to Dr. Diouf\u2019s class. Best decision I made here at Mason. Not only did she make the course less \u201chard\u201d, she also gave a lot of extra point opportunities. I just looked at my final exam grade and my final grade and I finished the class with an A. I highly recommend Dr. Diouf for BUS 310.",

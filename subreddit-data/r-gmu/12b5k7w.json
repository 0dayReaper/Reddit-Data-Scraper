            "comment": "They are all heavy workload classes. 310 and 262 have like 4-5 projects that are due every 2 weeks. Based on how well you manage your time you can do those on time, but keep in track that you are essentially learning about 2 different languages (310-Java and 262 -C), so that might stress some people out. As for 306, the workload is very heavy in the sense that you have a lot of discussion, reading and there\u2019s like a massive group project/ mock trial as a part of the course and research and prep for that should take a significant amount of time. \nI\u2019d suggest taking 306 during a somewhat light semester, and taking 262 and 310 together if you think learning about 2 languages and finishing your projects wouldn\u2019t be too much of a hassle.",

The only thing I\u2019d recommend is keeping 306 (cause it\u2019s a easier class, easier as in no coding but still a lot of other work) to take later when you\u2019re doing senior level courses. Cause those courses are gonna be hard and you\u2019d want something that\u2019s non-coding that can help you kinda get a fresh breath of air.",

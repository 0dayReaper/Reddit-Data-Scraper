I want to take physics III over the summer to get it out of the way but I\u2019m also doing a full time internship this summer. Is this doable or is it a really hard class that should be taken in person?",

            "comment": "I took it over the summer. Covered thermo, geo optics, and modern physics which was really just relativity. Think time dilation and length contraction. These are all pretty straightforward principles in my opinion. Many high schools cover these in their AP classes. Very doable over the summer. With an internship, I think it\u2019s very doable too. Really depends on how good you are with physics. You could always do the lab later as well.\n\nHave you checked the ECE discord?",

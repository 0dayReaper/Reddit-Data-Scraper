    "postText": "I normally get grades with which I'm satisfied, but for medical reasons this semester I did poorly (oculomotor problems after flawed eye surgery \ud83d\ude41), and I think my academic status will change to 'warning,' as my term GPA is probably at 2.00 or below. I plan to retake all the classes I took this semester next year (or over the summer, if I can get my medical problem resolved in time) to raise my GPA back up again. However I don't really plan on telling my parents about this. My father pays my tuition, he's an 'authorized user,' etc. If my academic standing changes from 'good' to 'warning,' is there any way he will be able to find this out, either through the online service for paying tuition or through any other channel of communication with the university? I know about FERPA, I'm just curious if there's any way he could incidentally find out about it. I'd rather pull it off silently and cleanly.",

(well, unless your parents have access to your patriot web account). If you have FAFSA, then that may be a different story, because you need a cumulative GPA of 2.0 to not fail SAP requirements.",

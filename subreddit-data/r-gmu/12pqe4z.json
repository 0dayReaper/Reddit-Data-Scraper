    "postText": "I am registering for MATH 300 this semester and the only option (only 2 are available for fall \u201823) that could work with my schedule was Robert Sachs. Can anyone who has taken this course with him let me know what it\u2019s like and what I need to prepare for? I\u2019ve seen on rate my professor that he\u2019s a nice guy but his course is basically a complex analysis class for teaching proofs which some people have a problem with cause he misses out on import sections that are needed for other classes like MATH 315. I have to register for 300 this semester and I hope taking him doesn\u2019t under-prepare me for my other courses.",

            "comment": "as long as you take 315 with prof walnut (so only during the fall semesters) you wont be underprepared. there arent many 300 sections anymore that go over specific topics for 315, so you'll be fine in any 315 section anyways",

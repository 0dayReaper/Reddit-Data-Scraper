I don\u2019t think you know how bad homophobic acts are in other countries. Richer countries are usually more educated so less racism and homophobia. No I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s perfect here but it\u2019s better than many places. Pride parades just wouldn\u2019t happen in many other places in the world..",

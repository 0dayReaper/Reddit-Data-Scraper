Seriously, go to your individual college\u2019s ceremony, get your degree, and skip the commencement. It will send a bigger message to the university if a bunch of students don\u2019t show up to hear him speak. That at this point is the only way to have our opinion heard.",

Consortium is specific to your college and school, so you are more likely to see people from your course of study. There\u2019s no limit on how many of your people can attend consortium. You walk across the stage at consortium. There\u2019s usually a college-specific gathering after consortium where your family is invited. If it were me, I\u2019d dress up and go to consortium. I\u2019d be outside protesting during commencement.",

            "comment": "Very interesting response. The main thing that came to mind was that this was his response despite every single time there is some politically divisive event in the country, he sends out an e-mail explicitly taking the liberal position on it. It makes me wonder why this is the one exception to that rule.\n\nI very much doubt that he actually wants Youngkin to speak at commencement, since his political positions are pretty easy to see from past correspondence. But if he did disinvite Youngkin, it would cause a political incident. I think the goal here was to try instead to half-apologize about the decision to the student body without actually invoking the public relations nightmare that would come from disinviting the literal governor. I don't believe for a second that he actually believes the stuff he's saying about the diversity of political ideas. Sure, there could be money involved, but GMU won't just get its funding cut because the governor couldn't speak at commencement. It seems more like they've gotten themselves into a situation that they can't really make everyone happy no matter how they respond. Instead of causing a political incident, they decided to try to do damage control on the side of the student body, knowing it will die down in a semester or two.\n\nPutting aside my personal feelings on the matter, people are pissed about this, but I think they're pissed at the wrong people. I think it's incredibly presumptuous to think that the university President is \"at fault\" here for not disinviting him since if you think about it for more than a second, its more than likely he personally doesn't align with Youngkin politically. I think he is correct that we shouldn't be disinviting people for political reasons, since diversity of ideas absolutely is a core pillar of what should make universities great, but I very much doubt he actually believes this and is just trying to do PR maneuvering.",

            "comment": "&gt;Mason students come by their objections to the Governor authentically, and **their rejection of his positions are rooted in very real, deeply personal, often painful life experiences**. It is my sincere hope that our students use this opportunity to share their stories, challenges and triumphs, and that the Governor will hear their opinions, respectfully consider and reflect on them, and consider that feedback when making, amending or changing his administration\u2019s policies.\n\nFirst, this seems to be discounting the reaction to Youngkin as purely an emotional reaction. Is it not logical that some of us don't want someone who has made it part of his agenda to [meddle in education](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/02/23/uva-bert-ellis-text-messages/) and [kowtow to a base that's anti-diversity](https://apnews.com/article/education-richmond-race-and-ethnicity-racial-injustice-virginia-8ad5da65b9cb05265f2b8081c41827cd)?\n\n&gt;This **discourse** highlights one of the fundamental purposes of a university. It is a place to engage, debate, and educate on topics where we agree and disagree, sometimes profoundly. If the Governor\u2019s speech were to be cancelled, it is unlikely that such public attention would be paid to the policies students so passionately oppose.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is vital because our students must prepare to inherit and lead a world with endless conflicts and divisions. Would we really be preparing them for that world if we removed the opportunities for them to safely engage in **debate and discourse**?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Or is it better to expose them to people and ideas that may offend or challenge them**, but in an environment of steadfast support and safety, so they may develop the agency to effectively express and advocate for themselves once they leave the university environment?\n\nSecond, describing this as a forum for debate is disingenuous. Is someone from BLM going to allowed to speak in response? Has a debate topic been selected? Is there going to be a moderator? Will questions from the student body be allowed? No? Then it's not a debate or a discussion. IMO, it's a honor conferred to the governor to address the student body. It gives legitimacy both to him as governor and to his agenda, especially the part of it that relates to education. It normalizes his crazy talk about CRT. Commencement isn't the time to be \"challenged.\" If you didn't do that in the previous four years, you've failed as an institution. It's a time for parting wise words. I sincerely hope that Youngkin has some to give and that his speech remains non-political, I really do. But he's one of the last people I would have selected.\n\nThe university screwed up, and it's too late to do anything about it now, because it will look political. Maybe whoever the commencement speaker is doesn't matter to you, but I feel sorry for the people that worked so hard and then have to listen someone they can't respect try to give them advice and inspire them.",

Over half the audience stood silently and turned their backs while her degree was conferred.\n\nI found it to be a sound and moving way of protesting for a few reasons: 1) it was visually striking; people didn\u2019t have listen for people trying to be heard in a huge area. Hundreds of people were visibly against what was going on, which also memorializes the protest in photographs and videos; 2) it\u2019s not a heckler\u2019s veto. The ability of the speaker to be heard isn\u2019t impeded, so the favorite pastime of conservatives playing the victim is neutered; 3) relatedly, anyone loudly objecting to the standing up is the one who would be disruptive. So if the governor had to stop speaking, it would be because of his own supporters. Same if school officials eject the people standing. Nothing about the proceedings would be stopped by the protest, yet the message would be quite visible.",

I've been sitting on the sidelines since this started until now just reading, but this is the comment that finally made me respond. How are there so many people commenting about free speech and censorship that don't understand it. This was a concept that I'm sure was taught in high school.\n\n\nFreedom of speech is something that says the government can not restrict speech. If you want to say \"black people are bad\" the government can't stop you. Twitter can.\n\n\nConversely the students of a public college banding together to say \"we don't want him as our graduation speaker\" is not infringing his freedom of speech. It's expressing theirs. If he had scheduled a campaign rally or speech or town hall and students were trying to have that cancelled, then the school (as a public entity) would not be allowed to do so because it's infringing on his right to freedom of speech. A subway doesn't have to let him give one though. If students were trying to get a town hall or similar event cancelled, I'd be pissed at the students because it is his right to have such an event.\n\nI'd be 100% in support of a rally or town hall for Youngkin existing, and any students against it showing up to publicly protest his policies. Do you see the differences here? By bestowing him the honor of being the graduation speaker, GMU is saying \"we do not mind his actions.\" Let's make another example and say GMU decided to invite Anthony Weiner to speak. I'd be pissed about that too, not because of political views but because I don't agree with his actions and don't think he deserves the honor. Does any of this make sense at all?",

It's comments like this that have pushed our political discourse into the garbage disposal. \n\nYou have two groups of people not listening to each other (this is absolutely NOT just a \"I think leftists need to listen to right wingers\" thing, this goes both ways) and accusing the other party of bigotry or child abuse or other nasty things. This is not happening on a large scale. Politicians of your ideological opposition are not faces for your weak straw man of what you think their beliefs are. At the very least they are human and worthy of basic dignity. \n\nI don't know about you, but I want the political discourse in this country to heal, I want republicans to be able to host democrats while thinking the best of them, and vice versa. I'm not asking either side to compromise on their beliefs, I'm just asking them to reach out to their sister or brother from across the aisle. Maybe this is an unrealistic utopian dream of mine, but it really ticks me off when people like you come in guns blazing about how [insert politician] is the worst person alive.

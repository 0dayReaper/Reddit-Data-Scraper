Talk about innocent until proven guilty. Ill just be here comforting my friends who are reliving traumatic experiences because a man accused of assault is now accepted by our faculty &amp; country (he's literally FINE btw), while the woman who accused him is currently unable to go back to work AS A PROFESSOR due to constant death threats and fear for her safety. \n\nThat's the world we live in. That's what you're protecting. So, remember that. \n\n(And to the victims out there getting discouraged by comments like these, I want you to know that way more people on this campus support you. We believe you, and we will stand in solidarity with you until these toxic views change and you can one day feel safe on campus &amp; in this world. With so much love, daughter of a victim.

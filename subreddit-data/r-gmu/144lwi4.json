    "postText": "I currently am signed up for June 20 virtual orientation which is my academic advising session. However, I\u2019m waiting for several AP scores that won\u2019t come until July 5, and one of them (calc bc) would allow me to skip doing any math placement exams if I at least get a 3.\n\nHowever July 21 is also quite a late orientation date so I\u2019d be one of the last to sign up for courses, and based on what I\u2019ve heard there won\u2019t be many spots left in anything CS by this point. \n\nShould I do the math placement exam anyway even though I\u2019ll probably get to override it? How do I even apply the ap credits after the academic advising session takes place?",

If you have the time, you might as well take the placement test so that, at the very least, you can secure your spot. When you get your scores back, figure out if they are good enough to test out of calc 1.",

But yeah I\u2019ll probably just stick with the earlier date and ask my advisor what I could change out once my ap scores come back.\n\n&gt;If you have the time, you might as well take the placement test so that, at the very least, you can secure your spot.

I\u2019ll consider doing it as a contingency though",

I really recommend the placement test since if you get a 3, that puts you in math 123, which means it'd take you two semesters just to finish calc 1. You def need a backup to make sure there's a spot for you in 113. \n\nI also want to point out, since i noticed you haven't made any mention to it, that a big part of the reason you need to secure your spot isn't because every single class will fill up, but you really want to make sure you have a good professor. They're going to fill up a lot faster.",

That is a good catch though I misread it initially so I thought I\u2019d still be getting credit for 113.\n\n&gt; a big part of the reason you need to secure your spot isn't because every single class will fill up, but you really want to make sure you have a good professor.

Do you have any suggestions for math 113, 114, 125, 213, and 203 professors?",

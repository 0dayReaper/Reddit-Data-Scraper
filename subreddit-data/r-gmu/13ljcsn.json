    "postText": "this may be a dumb question. I'm not sure how graduation ceremonies work since I didn't have a high school grad ceremony. \n\nI won't be looking at my phone during the ceremony, but I want to have it on me so I can contact my family afterward. But ofc I can't have it while I walk across the stage. Am I supposed to keep it in my seat and then return when I finish walking?",

You're also allowed to use your phones. Almost everyone was on their phone during mine today taking pictures or texting their family.",

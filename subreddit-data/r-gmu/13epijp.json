    "postText": "I applied to the Department of Navy Financial Mgmt &amp; Comptroller summer internship and got an offer. I start in June and I\u2019ve only talked to my \u201csupervisor\u201d about any updates. I was told that the HRO would reach out to me for further onboarding processes, but I\u2019ve got nothing yet, and I\u2019m getting a little worried. I have to get a security clearance done before starting and I\u2019m worried that everything won\u2019t be done in time before my start date. \n\nHas anyone else applied to this internship and/or in the same situation? Any advice?",

They\u2019ll start the investigation process for the clearance for you and you\u2019ll just need to wait. It is a lengthy process but it shouldn\u2019t effect your start date or onboarding.",

None of my professors let me reschedule, though my 285 professor offered that I take it BEFORE the rest of the class (which I obviously didn\u2019t accept).",

If that happens again reach out to either the department head or a third party (GMU staff not in engineering). Also the dean of engineering could potentially do something. I\u2019ve seen 3 in one day before, it\u2019s absolutely irresponsible scheduling by the powers that be and should not happen.",

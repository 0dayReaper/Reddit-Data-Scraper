It used to be that you take three separate tests for each section. But now all sections are in one test. By studying for all sections (if you can), you'll have a greater chance at success.",

Testing yourself on these topics before actually taking the Math Placement Test will be very helpful in getting a good score. The same goes for Googling study guides on those topics. So Studying  + Testing Yourself will more than prepare you for the Math Placement Test.",

    "postText": "To be honest, I was debating between VT and GMU and wondered if there were any similar majors to VT's BIT. \n\nI applied for CS when applying to GMU, but I feel that what VT offered with their BIT major would fit better with my interest and values. I know other schools most likely cannot replicate their programs, but I want the feeling of business and technology that is offered within the BIT major. Any help?\n\nOn a side note, if someone would like to share their experience of CS at GMU or BIT at VT, please share below!!",

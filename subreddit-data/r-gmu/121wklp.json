I was an undersecretary under the David Kanos admin ([which... I mean...](https://gmufourthestate.com/2018/04/29/how-a-title-ix-report-in-student-government-dragged-on-for-over-a-year/)) and quit before the news broke because it smelled so rotten. Just passive aggressivism and Roberts Rules of Order. I then rejoined [and quit again after like a third of the senate walked](https://gmufourthestate.com/2019/03/25/six-student-senators-resign-in-two-days/) and I liked some of them/found them redeemable (if they were approached in good faith at any point). Since then they [literally tried to impeach the younger Kanos sister and her admin for basically being lazy](https://gmufourthestate.com/2021/10/27/student-senators-attempt-to-impeach-student-body-president-and-vice-president-fails/). Now I'm not taking sides in these three arguments because it's incredibly stupid and inconsequential, but:\n\n1. It's not hard to see when you enter this room with these forty or fifty prospective prospective politicians all spitting on each other how actual politics aren't any better.\n2. Since it's all political majors, there's something to be said about how a hive mind famously accomplishes nothing, in the same way that if it was ENTIRELY STEM majors nobody would have a constructive conversation.\n3. Maybe I just don't understand how it works in capital hill hiring, but I fail to see how indiscriminately knife fighting for four years sets you up for good career prospects. Broadly speaking, the people out there hiring are generally adults are idealistic about looking to see if you put your head down and worked on something valuable during college.\n4. It bleeds over into other orgs, namely Fraternity and Sorority Life, and FSL isn't exactly setup to tackle university issues socially. FSL is also such a huge deal at Mason it centralizes power even more - if FSL gets a disproportionate ear of Student Involvement and Student Government does too and SG is in FSL, then GG.\n\nWhen you add all of this up, it just look like people wasting their own time which I find incredibly wasteful, especially in college. College is a time where you have access and resources to make actual difference, as someone who started a (at least then) student org which ran tri-state cybersecurity summits, sent dozens of competitive teams across state lines, etc. I could absolutely not do that today just incorporating a non-profit or something. It takes me no more than a few weeks to step back and go \"man I got nothing done lately\" - I don't get how people do it for a full four years. If you want to argue and spread rumors, that's what high school was for.\n\nMason Lobbying Day seemed to mostly be internship hunting, having been offered a summer gig at it (I refused because I didn't even realize I was being offered it - \"well what are you doing this summer? do you need something to do?\", much to the chagrin of the polisci people with me). It felt indicative of the broader org for the students to get a paid trip to Reston only to job hunt.",

And my impression of those people is that most of them do not care and are just there to pad their resume, stroke their own egos, and promote their friends/fraternities. I can literally count on one finger the number of people I know on student gov who actually care. \n\nLike two years ago there was a prominent member that made some public remarks denying the Armenian Genocide on social media, got called out for it, and refused to apologize. Turns out she was running for like Student Gov chair of student involvement at the next student gov meeting, and I firmly believe she would have gotten it if people didn't show up.  All her friends voted for her or refused to vote against her. The debating for letting her on went on for far too long though. Too many people were protecting her scummy behavior. \n\nLiterally the only good things student government did in my time there was Patriot Pantry, and Patriot Protection Program. Nothing else in my time there was of use at all.",

It's hard to find articles about this because Youngkin and AG backed down immediately after conservative attorney generals started calling it gross overreach. A lot has happened in a year.\n\nWhen fascists rose to power in Germany and Italy, the first books they burned were ones they believed to be sexually immoral. Noticing a trend between Nazis burning books that had gay lovers in them and Youngkin banning books with gay lovers in them.\n\nTrends don't seem to be something you pick up on all that well though, considering censorship has been a tool primarily utilized by the conservative movement. Prosecuting communists and homosexuals in the 50s, can't discuss sexual orientation in schools... It's interesting how the side screaming free speech always has their \"reasonable exceptions.\" Let's be real, it's just about you wanting only your ideas unrestricted, and that's why I don't have to engage in this debate above.\n\nNot to mention getting that George Mason wrote the precursor to the Bill of Rights and that's why I referenced it, you clearly can't get past one-step thinking.\n\nAnyone who wants to see your views on free speech can go through your unhinged post history like I have. Posting on TheDonald and prolife subreddits about satanists, you've clearly got your own invented reality that there's no point to me trying to reason through.\n\nYou can grandstand all day, but the 1st Amendment works for private citizens, it doesn't protect government officials acting in their roles, only when acting as private citizens. An event getting cancelled does not legally suggest disruption, which has to do with public spectacle (and not the kind of spectacle you're going to try and argue anyway).\n\nYou should take Civil Law at Mason, it'd help you a lot with grounding your imaginary views.\n\nOr better yet, leave it to those of us who actually study it.",

I simply am not going to let bullshit fly. When someone is sitting here trying to claim that *its the purpose of freedom of speech to censor others*, I'm going to call that out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Here is your requested source. It's hard to find articles about this because Youngkin and AG backed down immediately after conservative attorney generals started calling it gross overreach. A lot has happened in a year.\n\nHilariously, this article actually disproves your entire argument because literally the first thing said in the article is that Miyares was doing this, not Youngkin. Additionally, the article stated that once the Virginia Association of Commonwealth Attorneys voiced concern, Miyares immediately rewrote the bill and scaled it back, not something someone acting like a \"fascist\" would do. So thank you for inadvertently proving my point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;When fascists rose to power in Germany and Italy, the first books they burned were ones they believed to be sexually immoral.\n\nWhich might be an excellent argument, if removing books from schools was even remotely similar to banning and burning books.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Noticing a trend between Nazis burning books that had gay lovers in them and Youngkin banning books with gay lovers in them.\n\nFunny how you are failing to mention that the \"gay lovers\" in the book in question are *underage children* and said book contains explicit illustrations of said underaged children *performing oral sex on each other*. Seems like a weird thing to leave out, doesn't it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Trends don't seem to be something you pick up on all that well though, considering censorship has been a tool primarily utilized by the conservative movement.\n\nOh my holy shit that is a laughable statement.\n\nNot even remotely close my friend. The left have been the ones for the past several decades pushing for \"hate speech\" laws, and pushing for comedy to be censored and comedians to cancelled if their jokes are \"offensive.\"\n\nOr hey, what about the information that was revealed as part of the twitter files, where it was shown that the democrats where actively colluding with Twitter to censor speech they didn't like?\n\nOr hell, let's just skip all of that and just straight up show the Pew Research data that proves you wrong:\n\n[Democrats and Democratic-leaners have increased their support of government censorship from 40% to 65% and their support of tech companies censoring online content from 60% to 76%. Over the same time, Republican and GOP-leaning adults have soured on both, dropping from 37% support for government censorship and 48% support for Big Tech censorship to 28% and 37%, respectively.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/08/18/more-americans-now-say-government-should-take-steps-to-restrict-false-information-online-than-in-2018/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Prosecuting communists and homosexuals in the 50s, can't discuss sexual orientation in schools...\n\nFunny how you have to go back to the 50s for an example of the conservatives censoring while I can provide you examples of the left censoring within the last couple months. It's really telling.\n\nAs for the whole \"can't discuss sexual orientation in school\" part, once again, you oddly enough seem to be leaving out important parts that I really can't see any other reason to leave out other than knowing that if they are brought up it destroys your whole argument. And of course that particular fact you're leaving out is that the only part of schools that were banned from discussing sexual orientation are K-5 classrooms, which of course begs the question, why do you want to talk about sexual orientation and sexual stuff with young, prepubescent children? If they have questions about that stuff they can ask their parents because school teachers should not be talking about sex with children under the age of 11.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;It's interesting how the side screaming free speech always has their \"reasonable exceptions.\"\n\nNot talking about sex with prepubescent children is not a reasonable exception?\n\nMeanwhile, the left is saying that anything that they disagree with is a \"Reasonable\" exception.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Let's be real, it's just about you wanting only your ideas unrestricted, and that's why I don't have to engage in this debate above.\n\nAgain, more laughable lack of self-awareness. At this point if I didn't know any better I'd say you're trolling me.\n\nPoint to me any time where conservatives have tried to get a leftist speaker banned from speaking, literally any at all. Because I can point to countless examples of leftists constantly trying to censor and deplatform anyone they disagree with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for saying you don't have to engage in the debate because \"I'm right and you're wrong\" , I'm sorry buddy, but that's not how debate works.\n\nOnce again, time for quotes:\n\n&gt;We can never be sure that the opinion we are endeavoring to stifle is a false opinion; and if we were sure, stifling it would be an evil still.\n\n\\- John Stuart Mill\n\n&gt;To refuse a hearing to an opinion because they are sure that it is false, is to assume that their certainty is the same thing as absolute certainty. All silencing of discussion is an assumption of infallibility.\n\n\\- John Stuart Mill\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Anyone who wants to see your views on free speech can go through your unhinged post history like I have. Posting on TheDonald\n\nAh yes, I've posted so much on a subreddit that was banned even before I joined reddit, clearly. Not to mention, attacking me on shit like where I post instead of the actual content of my arguments, classic move of someone who can't actually win on the content of their argument.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;and prolife subreddits about satanists,\n\nFunny how once again, you leave out important context. Seems to be a favorite pastime of yours. Nevermind that the comment in question was regarding a pro-choice person who was literally using Satanism as their argument, which is the only reason I brought it up in my comment. I'm an atheist my man, I don't give the slightest shit about religion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;you've clearly got your own invented reality that there's no point to me trying to reason through.\n\nOnce again, speaking to a mirror there friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;You can grandstand all day, but the 1st Amendment works for private citizens, it doesn't protect government officials acting in their roles, only when acting as private citizens.\n\nGiving a speech at a university is acting as a private citizen. He isn't acting in his capacity as governor by doing a speaking event.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;imaginary views.\n\nAh yes, the teachings of the most influential liberal thinkers in history, the beliefs of the founding fathers, the actual inarguable written goal of GMU, *imaginary views*. You are a bucket of laughs my guy.\n\nAnyway, I have projects to work on so I'm done with this. Farewell.",

Touch grass dude.\n\nLike you're sitting here trying to play gotchas with things I linked like we're reviewing sources for a fake case. No, Youngkin's AG who he is openly a political ally though pushed for this legislation, without a peep from the governor. It took other conservatives telling him no - Youngkin would have pushed back if he had an issue. Why are you sitting here arguing that logically a fascist wouldn't reneg? Fascists and authoritarian statesmen in governments regularly do this tactic - you propose extremes and then roll it back to make yourself seem reasonable. Nazis did it, Italian fascists did it, Spanish fascists did it, Japanese fascists did it, Brazil, Hungary... \n\nAnd citing one single weird book as a strong argument for banning at least 20 books at once isn't a real argument.\n\nLike what point are you making? That in your simulated debate world things don't work a certain way? Yeah but you need to recognize that logicing you way through all these issues isn't how any relevant party is actually acting. You are grounding your beliefs in a FICTION of how you think people should behave, not the on-the-ground facts.\n\nThose are the only tidbits I saw and I really don't care for the rest of what you have to say.

Hell, no law is even going to prevent you from getting it and giving it to your kids. There is a stark difference between not allowing inappropriate books in schools and literally banning books so no one can read them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;and expressed direct support for total legal circumvention of local Commonwealth Attorneys\n\nCare to provide a source to this claim because I just searched for about 20 minutes and couldn't find a single thing even suggesting that Youngkin ever expressed such.\n\nCome now, this is an institute of higher learning, you should know by now that claims must be backed by evidence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;which are elected positions.\n\nOkay, so since you seem to be claiming to have an issue with people going against elected officials, do you take issue with the fact that President Biden has enacted more executive orders than any president in history, enacting hundreds alone in just the first couple weeks? After all, congress members are elected officials, are they not? And considering executive orders directly bypass Congress, surely you'd have an issue with that as well right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Glenn Youngkin may not be everything everyone accuses him of, but he certainly approaches the legal system exactly like fascists do.\n\nAh no, he approaches the legal system in the exact way the Constitution of Virginia gives the governor the power to do so.\n\nHowever, you know who has acted much like fascists do? Oh, that's right, Northam.\n\nTell me, did you take issue with Northam when he violated due process by firing board officials in the middle of a hearing because they were going against what he wanted? Did you take issue with the extensive number of executive orders he signed? Did you take issue with his extensive pushes to violate Virginians\u2019 2nd amendment rights, and his attempts to bypass Commonwealth Attorneys (hmm, why does that sound familiar) by forcing them to enforce said unconstitutional gun laws?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;You're clearly unaware of what the First Amendment means as well since you think it's relevant here.\n\nNo, I am fully aware of what it means and I will direct you to the Supreme Court Case *Healy v. James* which explicitly states that the inability to infringe upon first amendment rights extends fully to any publicly funded body including public universities.\n\nFurthermore, as is explained in the [Report of the Committee on Freedom of Expression](https://provost.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/documents/reports/FOECommitteeReport.pdf) of the University of Chicago, under this extension of the 1st amendment to universities, a university has a \"commitment to free, robust, and uninhibited debate and deliberation among all members of the University\u2019s community.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;It's actually First Amendment rights protecting the PETITIONERS, not Glenn Youngkin\n\nYes, and that would be the case if they were protesting, not trying to silence someone and prevent them from speaking.\n\nIf people so wish to go and protest outside his event, they're completely within their right to do so and I in fact fully encourage them to do so as doing so is to exercise their rights.\n\nHowever, as has already been pointed out by another individual on here, protests are not allowed to physically disrupt the event they are protesting. Now it's pretty inarguable that shutting down an event before it can even occur is disrupting rhe event.\n\nFurther more, simply put, silencing and deplatforming political opponents is not something *classically liberal* individuals who care about *upholding rights and freedoms* do. Silencing and deplatforming political opponents is something *authoritarians and fascists* do.\n\nIf your opponent is wrong, then you provide counter arguments, you do not silence them.\n\nTo relay one of my favorite quotes which is very appropriate in this particular case:\n\n&gt;You cannot take away freedom to protect it, you cannot destroy the free market to save it, and you cannot uphold freedom of speech by silencing those with whom you disagree. To take rights away to defend them or to spend your way out of debt defies common sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;you fucking clown.\n\nAh, those who can't defend their position with arguments instead resort to insults.",

So my knowledge is very limited compared to other students in the programs, but as they recently changed some things, I hope this helps with your decision.\n\nThe way that they explained the years to us was whether you were full-time or part-time, as recently adapted to the cohort method for our year. Full-time, which already includes summers, is three years total, and if you wanted to take an extra class, they would strongly advise against it as the classes are difficult to manage and require an extensive amount of work. also, the need to study for internships, whether you were in school or clinical counseling. It is important to note that clinical counseling has a licensure exam to practice for, while school counseling doesn't.",

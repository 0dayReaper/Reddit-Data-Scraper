    "postText": "i need some advice on finding an internship. im a cs major switching from to it next fall. I applied for a lot this past fall, but i got rejected or never back from all of them. I'm planning to restratigize how i find opportnities, as just straight up applying clearly didn't work for me. I plan on going to more networking events and seeing what those are like, while applying.\n\nIt's just overall frustrating knowing that most of the cs courseload is all theory-heavy and majority of what i do here i am not going to utilize in the workforce. This is why i want to find an internship and just find myself more opportunities in general to build up my resume.\n\nOn top of that, I don't even know what I want career-wise. I am sure that I want to be in tech, but which area I have no clue. This is why it frustrates me even more that i couldn't find an offer for this summer as i'm gonna be wasting another summer.\n\nany advice would be appreciated and honestly just some positive words would be nice bc i have been upset.",

Check out this site where you can actually go in and talk to someone about finding the right fit: https://oscar.gmu.edu/students/ and even better you can be assigned a mentor. FYI they\u2019re usually paid gigs. It\u2019s been a great way for me to build my connections and resume. \n\nNow for getting more involved in an internship in industry, check out RippleMatch, they\u2019re a newer job board platform geared more towards students (Got my a full-time offer after about a month of applying) and that means better chances of interviews and you\u2019re not stuck with the over crowded LinkedIn and Handshake apps only. You\u2019ll get more catches when you can keep building that resume though. They have algos to automate the app review process most of the time so no good experience will just get automatically rejected.",

Competition is higher than ever since all those top company folks are now on the market at the same time just trying to find what they can.\n\nIf anything focus more on applying for government jobs that\u2019s probably the best place to look. They\u2019re always behind, don\u2019t really do lay offs, and they\u2019re desperate for people (mainly because their salaries are capped and always behind)",

            "comment": "I can empathize. I would give your resume a real solid review, don\u2019t be afraid to try new formats and maximize the amount of self-selling you put on there. I submitted mine to like 50 companies before I realized it really needed improvement. If you haven\u2019t already, you should get it reviewed by either professionals you know in the industry or folks on campus. Their input helped mine reach it\u2019s final form, and I\u2019m still sometimes tweaking it.\n\nOn another note, cast as wide a net as humanly possible. It might feel late in the game, but the reality is that there\u2019s still companies with infilled intern seats who are still taking applicants. Don\u2019t have down time, apply constantly, leave no stone unturned in your search. Additionally, really evaluate your digital-professional presence. Get your Handshake and LinkedIn looking pristine. Do you have an appealing professional headshot as your photo? Chock your profile\u2019s full of things you can use as reason\u2019s that you should get hired. \n\nAlso, a cover letter might sound like a bore to slog through but it can help. It shows determination and your willingness to do something tedious to get the job done. I typically reserve these for positions I feel really strongly about, but you should also not be submitting the very same resume to every company. Slightly personalize it based on the direct details of the specific position.\n\nGood luck.\n\nEdit: one last tip is to directly reach out to hiring managers or recruiters on LinkedIn after you\u2019ve applied to a company\u2019s position. This shows initiative. You should sign up for the free month of LinkedIn Premium if you haven\u2019t already.",

Get help making your resume look nice and communicating your accomplishments/skills well. The career center is a good place to start but also check out career center resources published online from other schools like VT. If you\u2019re not hearing back at all then the issue is your resume/cover letter. It also helps to find contact info of a recruiter and directly reaching out after you apply and saying hey I just submitted an application but wanted to personally reach out to express my interest. The career fair is good for asking what they\u2019re looking for and getting the recruiters contact info. Also if you meander around campus you\u2019ll find flyers for opportunities in different places. You just gotta put yourself out there, find 2 or 3 good opportunities that give you skills/experience to point to on your resume, and keep in touch with the companies. Good luck",

I\u2019ve worked in government contracting since last summer as an intern (then now as a full time employee) and it\u2019s been steady and I haven\u2019t had worries about layoffs. Our contracts are long term, so I know I\u2019ll at least have a job through the duration of the program I\u2019m on unless I choose to leave. Because the market is messed up rn I\u2019d just keep applying and don\u2019t get down on yourself about rejections.\n\nSide note - I think I was rejected for like 1000 roles between jobs and internships! I was applying daily!",

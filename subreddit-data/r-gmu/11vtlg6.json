    "postText": "Is the honors college workload a lot especially for those who are majoring in computer science? How much writing and research is there in the honors college compared to the Mason core? And how does the living learning community for the honors college assist honors college students: what sort of activities do they have and is it worth it to live in that living learning community? \n\nThanks!",

You dont have to take 100 person english lectures.",

            "comment": "As a CS major, early registration from the honor college is a huge advantage since you would get to follow your desired schedule as classes fill up very quickly. You have the earliest registration so you don't even have to compete with juniors/seniors.\n\nFor the honor classes, you could choose the topics you like, and the workload would depend on the topics and the professors. From my personal experience, I only did the bare minimum workload and still pass those classes with an A so they're really not much. The credits are about the same, but you don't have to struggle through a bunch of art, history, communication, etc. classes",

            "comment": "I'm in the humanities. My experience has been that honors college is generally worth it; none of the classes I've taken have been super hard, a lot are discussion-based or group-work based. The hardest class I took wasn't even really hard in terms of classwork, there was just a lot of reading for it. I feel like the streamlined core enabled me to explore more things and have a minor. I think that as long as you can read and write briskly, you wouldn't have any big problems in keeping up with honors classes. It's not back-breaking work.",

            "comment": "I did that route as a CS major. Would recommend 10/10 times solely for the priority registration. Because you pick before the rest of your peers, you always get to 1- pick the professor you want 2- for the class you want 3- at the time you want. CS courses fill up so quickly that this is a huge bonus.\n\nThe writing is slightly higher during your first semester, but everything is completely manageable. Everything after HNRS 110 was an absolute cakewalk. In my experience, most HNRS courses were 15-20 motivated students chatting with the professor about some topic the professor is highly motivated to talk about.\n\nThere was a requirement when I was a student that you had to take a few HNRS sections of a regular class. For example, I took CS211H instead of CS211. I had a separate lab group for HNRS students only and the programming projects usually had an extra section to them which was harder and required around 25% more time. Though you could usually get an A- overall in the class even if you never attempted those extra sections.",

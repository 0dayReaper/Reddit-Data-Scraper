I\u2019m a computer engineer, and my life was greatly enriched by the history, literature, arts, and sciences classes I took.\n\nIn fact, the computer science classes I took have been among the least useful classes I\u2019ve taken.  Big O notation is cool, as are Karnaugh maps, minterms, and maxterms.\n\nAlmost everything else I\u2019ve learned on the job (especially since the 80286 was released when I was in school).\n\nWhat OP is pining for here is a trade school that offers a certificate program.  Those can be really good, too, and I wish they got the respect they deserve.  \n\nMy experience is that some countries value these programs more than others do.  I believe that this sort of education/career path is more accepted in Scandinavia.  I have family in Denmark, and have known plenty of folks who\u2019ve taken this path and then gone on to do quite well for themselves.\n\nBut, there is still value in the core curriculum - it\u2019s just not going to be obvious to you in your first few jobs.",

Like religious studies and other fields would starve of research funding if everyone is majoring in STEM. So the school forces us to fund them. \n\nHonestly, this is controversial but universities are a dying industry just like the taxi business(by Uber), the hotel industry(by Airbnb), the movie industry (by netflex), etc. Smart people are just wandering why the education industry is still stuck in the 1800s format where you pay huge amount to these monopolistic institutes who can't even guarantee you job for a piece of information you can find for free on the web or buy it for a fraction of cost. Businesses are also less and less interested in degrees when hiring developers these days. \n\nWe're stubborn animals that respect tradition and scared of change.

There's some truth to it, as European university curricula tend to be more specialized which usually results in a \\~3 year course for the Bachelors. That being said, this also comes with the caveat that incoming university students in these programs are already *well prepared* by the time they enroll. University freshman in the US are, by a wide margin, not even remotely as well prepared as their European counterparts. Hence, their first year or two are often spent becoming \"college prepared\" (broadening horizons, developing critical thinking skills, practicing discourse, etc.) instead of actually experiencing \"college-level topics\", so to speak.\n\nAlso, for every person I've seen express this, a good chunk (if not the majority) of them have poor foundational skills in writing and/or arithmetic. I've seen engineering majors complain about essay writing while answering verbal questions like 7th graders and I've seen psychology majors almost to the point of tears over a basic statistics course despite it being the lifeblood of their discipline.",

Think of the courses outside of your major as a gift, something you can normally have some choice in to fulfill the requirement.  I always went broad because I wanted to take a break from the core of my focus in those classes, it makes your mental routine more varied and it is usually abstractly or directly useful to your core studies. I took Art history at NVCC with Thomas Hardy and it changed my worldview significantly, I was on their engineering transfer track, so it was outside my general focus but I can't explain how it broadened my mind to see more complexity in the world.  This is true of a lot of courses I took outside my main interest.\n\nAs an aside, I really wish adults could just take any college course they wanted for free at a local community college and then university for more specialized disciplines.  Human achievement is limited by our rate of education, we need to reduce the barriers to people becoming specialized in, or exposed to whatever interests them.",

I signed up for my classes this semester thinking I was going to be bored to tears in the ENG and HIST classes I had to sign up for the core requirements, but I am actually really enjoying both. My ENG is women in history and we are reading/analyzing horror stories all semester and I definitely dig it!  And believe it or not, the information I am learning in my history class actually is contributing to my understanding of the information in one of my IT classes. I honestly think, in some cases, it's truly helpful because of the more recent demand for soft skills in the technical fields. \n\nSo, yes, to agree with another poster, it sucks that we are required to spend money and time to take classes that aren't really relevant to our career aspirations, but I do think they (some of them) turn out to be really great! \n\nI would like to say, though, that those of us on the BAS track having to take BAS300 (I haven't taken the other ones so far) is a load of bullhonkey ESPECIALLY since BAS is exclusively for transfer juniors (right?) and that class seems to be better suited for freshmen (writing resumes, leadership styles, how to apply for jobs, etc).

Media analysis requires critical thinking and communication skills.\n\nArt is subjective, so when you analyze it as a class you need to demonstrate that you have the ability to convincingly argue for your interpretation of the piece.\n\nFor instance, is the movie Blackhawk Down pro war or anti war?\n\nThere is no right answer to this question, but it's very possible to convincingly argue for either interpretation of the film. In taking a class like this you learn how to understand and argue for the things you value and believe in.",

    "postText": "I ordered about a month ago. When I track the order it still says that it hasn\u2019t gone out to be delivered. I tried calling them and emailed them and they never answer. \n\nCan anyone let me borrow their cap and gown for the 19th? I will pay you $50 and return it back to you. Master\u2019s student, college of engineering, and I\u2019m 5\u2019 6\u201d male.\n\nUpdate: I visited the bookstore and they said they talked to their rep over at the cap and gown company. They\u2019ll ship everything by Monday, they\u2019re doing overnight shipping. They\u2019re apparently overwhelmed and our school is the last to hold their graduation in the order of the schools that deal with that company. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffd\n\n2nd update: That company is a disaster. It\u2019s Tuesday afternoon and they haven\u2019t shipped anything out. I went to the bookstore and bought it. Luckily I found my size, should\u2019ve done that from the beginning. I will sell this cap and gown to anyone graduating next year from college of engineering for like $40 if anyone wants it.",

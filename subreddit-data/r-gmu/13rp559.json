I've double-checked on Patriot Web to make sure I'm still registered for the class and emailed the professor too but no response. Not really sure what to do now.",

Check the course meeting dates that correspond with your section letter (A, B, C, etc) [here](https://registrar.gmu.edu/calendars/fall_2023/).\n\nIf your course truly did start on the 22nd, you should email the registrars office asap, and forward the email to your prof that went unanswered. Hopefully that helps!",

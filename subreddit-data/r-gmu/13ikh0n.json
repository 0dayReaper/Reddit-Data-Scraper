It\u2019s not cheap but I hope it\u2019s what you need. Frankly I\u2019d recommend you see if the VCCS system offers something for you\u2014 pride aside from it being a community college or Mason, it\u2019s going to be better for you all around.",

The fees alone should be a reason. If you are transferring, I\u2019ll also suggest that what the registrar puts in your degree versus transferred from within the Uni varies per college. \n\nSeriously, I know some who have taken classes just to not go to VCCS. Take the advantageous financial option that works for you. Some colleagues of mine went to NoVa and are now going through Ivy League programmes. \n\nBest to you",

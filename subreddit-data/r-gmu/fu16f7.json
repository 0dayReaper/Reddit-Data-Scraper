If I had to do this and go back to be with my parents because I lost my housing, I would absolutely fail.   The academic obligations I agreed to meant living independent of them, abusive narcicists.  And that is with  relative privelage, my old apartments had entire families living in a studio.  How is even the best student supposed to pass in those environments?  Thank God I'm out of school.",

I found a study guide for the placement exam but worry it isn't enough, so I was wondering if Aleks is a good place to study since there is a lot of youtube videos going over it. If not, what materials should I be looking at to pass an 80 on the exam.\n\nTHANKS!!",

I had to figure this out by myself by reading some stuff under the math center website when I had to register for a math placement test only to learn thag I didn't need to do a math placement test due to the fact I completed the ALEKS self learning program. You have to email the person listed or the Math Department to request the math placement override for a selected class and they'll say you're all clear after they check that you completed either the Aleks program, got a B or higher in a Calc class in HS, or got the required score for your math class of your choice.\n\nYou do not need to waste your time any further with the placement test\n\nUnless I read your question wrong entirely. If I did, my bad, the best thing that I think that was most effective was doing khan Academy since it's interactive and pretty in depth",

OP register for math 008 and get started on the prep. Then go to the math testing center to take your Aleks final test.",

I signed up for it and recieved an email and was placed into the blackboard class, I had to purchase a key with the class code they told me to and that key was the software license key. When you finished signing up and purchasing the key, you'll be asked to complete a comprehensive test to see how well your understanding is. If you do really good on the test, you won't have to do very much, if you're like me and did bad, you will have to take quite a bit of units in ALEKS. \n\nThe ALEKS class is self taught and is MATH 008, that's where I think you were getting confused. You probably thought they were separate things, but they are the same thing. So yes, you must sign up for math 008 in order to get the Override",

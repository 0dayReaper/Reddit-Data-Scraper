Professors are supposed to submit the grades a day before commencement. \n\nOnce Grades are up on Patriot Web, professors only have few hours to change them. If they cross the time limit, they have to go through Office of Registrar to change grades. \n\nMost of the professors atleast in my school, don\u2019t upload final grades in blackboard they directly upload it to patriot web, as they don\u2019t like students asking for personal considerations. \n\nEdit: I was a TA in CEC.",

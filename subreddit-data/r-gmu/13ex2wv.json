    "postText": "Hi, my homework from a writing intensive class was marked for plagiarism because there were some words that were copied but with citations. I honestly believe that it is minor. The professor also said that there were some cases of improper paraphrasing that even with citations, they are still considered plagiarism. I can send screenshots of the document to whomever can help me.\n\nI\u2019m at loss with what to do. I work full time at night and didn\u2019t sleep during the whole semester for some days to attend the class and submit all the homework on time. She told me that I can appeal to the Honor Committee and but may face academic penalties. Even though it\u2019s the lab portion and I\u2019m doing well in the lecture, I will still fail the class and I can\u2019t afford retaking it especially since it\u2019s 5 credits. I have severe depression and generalized anxiety and it\u2019s flaring up so bad that I don\u2019t trust myself with life decisions anymore. I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m just trying to hard to graduate but I don\u2019t think I can finish my Bachelor\u2019s anymore. Please help.",

In the past, I\u2019ve gotten it thrown out and still passed the class and had to redo the whole assignment in a few days. \n\nIt depends on how much was \u201cplagiarism.\u201d Was it through her own detector or through safeassign. If it was, what was the %?\n\nUltimately if you dont win, they could put you on probation or watch, you fail the class, and have to retake lab only. Not much you can do about that. Just be more careful next time.",

You could explain your concerns in an email to him, and if you wish to remain anonymous you could request that. Stay positive and I want to see you graduating !!! Even I don\u2019t know you , I will clap \ud83d\udc4f for you and you efforts!!! Do it",

As far as i know, commencement is the none important one that most ppl don\u2019t go to and it\u2019s just ppl talking and giving speeches? And graduation is where you get to walk across the stage right? If so how many tickets do you get for grad.  I want to make sure that everyone in my family is able to come",

For this semester, they required tickets. It was max 9? reserve tickets per grad for this semester. The ceremony was yesterday, don't worry about it.\n\nDegree celebration is for your specific school (school of engineering, school of business, etc.). You will have to opportunity to walk across the stage. and smile at a camera for a picture. As of right now, you don't need any kind of ticket for this one.\n\nThat's it.",

            "comment": "Yeah commencement was mostly speeches, and doctorate grads walked. Undergrads were recognized and had degrees conferred as a group by college, and moved our tassels. At the degree celebrations everybody got to walk and they gave us a rolled up sheet that basically said \"yayy you're an alumni now lol.\" Each ceremony was very cool and imo a good culmination of my college experience :) Also the COS grads got a freaking beaker mug. Honestly it's so simple but freaking adorable because I love knick knacks like that haha",

    "postText": "Long story short, I failed 2 classes this semester which drops my gpa to a 1.84, so below a 2.0.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be suspended or put on probation, since for Fall 2021 and Spring 2022, I was on probation both times.  I was in good standing for Fall 2022 (3.17), but with this semester I\u2019ll be put back on academic probation.\n\nI was planning on retaking 2 classes over the summer semester to raise my GPA, but since this is the third offense, I\u2019m afraid that my summer classes will be auto dropped.\n\nI have 64 credits transferred from NVCC, and 36 attempted so far at GMU.\n\nThe academic status chart I was sent from CEC says a GPA of 1.55-1.94 is Academic Probation, but idk if I use my 36 credits to calculate my standing or the total including the transferred credits. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s useful to add, but I had a really rough semester mentally, and only gained access to disability services/help right before finals.\n\nPlease don\u2019t give me backlash, I know I fucked up really badly and it\u2019s my own fault.",

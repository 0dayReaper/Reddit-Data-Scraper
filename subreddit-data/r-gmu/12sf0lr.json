    "postText": "I've been wanting to start going to the gym for a while now but I've been struggling due to weird social anxiety. Are there any gym facilities that are pretty empty and what times? I primarily want to use treadmills. I also would appreciate any information about how changing rooms work or what you do with your stuff at the gym as well as the layout of gyms so I know where I'm going. Anything would help lmfao",

            "comment": "First of all, good. That\u2019s an awesome life choice to make.\n\nGyms will be less crowded mid mornings and more crowded in the evenings and at standard meal times. You\u2019ll usually not have to worry about there being an open treadmill for you to use, there are plenty of them.\n\nChanging rooms are changing rooms. You can lock your stuff if you have a lock, but most just keep their stuff in a cubby out near the equipment.\n\nOverall don\u2019t worry about being anxious. Everybody else in there, even the biggest most jacked person, started off nervous and self conscious. Confidence takes time.\n\nThere\u2019s a universal gym etiquette. This is incredibly important. Since you\u2019re new to the gym, I highly recommend looking up some YouTube videos on what not to do in the gym. \n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to ask questions. From gym staff or other folks working out. (Just not WHILE they\u2019re actively lifting a weight or on a machine). In my experience the more in-shape somebody is, the happier they are to help with fitness related questions.\n\nTry to stay motivated and have fun!",

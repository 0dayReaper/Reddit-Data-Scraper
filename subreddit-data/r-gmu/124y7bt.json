    "postText": "I\u2019ve decided to selectively withdraw for the first time from a class that i\u2019m not doing atrocious in but i\u2019m not in the right place for another poor grade. I met with an undergraduate advisor but unfortunately i think she was new and i didn\u2019t get all my answers. \n\nIs SW a for-sure withdrawal, or does it need to be approved/have a reason? Additionally, how long does it usually take between sending the form and being withdrawn? \n\nThank you so much!",

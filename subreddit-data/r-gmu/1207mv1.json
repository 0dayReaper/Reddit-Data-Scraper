My research is looking at the future of self-driving cars by analyzing the current acceptance level of a population of drivers. The questions in the second section are repeats from the first section to mesaure differences in responses. All feedback is appreciated, thanks!\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfUVx9hiYGqhPdLljOJIbLNkE0v8heMJ7XDEZc7XHyP26VHOw/viewform?usp=sf\\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfUVx9hiYGqhPdLljOJIbLNkE0v8heMJ7XDEZc7XHyP26VHOw/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

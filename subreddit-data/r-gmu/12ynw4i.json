    "postText": "One of my professors has my grade for the midterm as 150/150 in blackboard but as a D in patriotweb. I just thought to check patriotweb due to another professor not having any grades in blackboard as saw that grade. Is that allowed and is there anything I can do? I wouldn\u2019t be complaining if the two platforms matched their grade whatever that grade was.\nedit: all grades logged on blackboard are 100/100 so I have a A+ according to that.",

Depends on your condition, I think your Professor May made the same mistake (or system have some problems, although I thought the former is the reason) Sent him/her an email to ask that, if he/she not reply you l, ask that after class. Just say \u201cthe system may went wrong.\u201d Hope this helpful.",

Like I\u2019m happy with all the assignments having 100/100 but idk why that\u2019s not what I\u2019m seeing on patriotweb lmao. \n\nthank you tho!",

Fortunately it\u2019s not important, keep hard working to make sure you got a good grade on final!",

Like attendance or participation?\n\nNot saying that should make such a big jump, but sometimes blackboard is not used for overall grading.  \n\nEither way, if the professor has office hours, it may be good to attend them and ask for an explanation that way to ensure you are on the same page and perhaps discover if there was an issue in reporting, etc.",

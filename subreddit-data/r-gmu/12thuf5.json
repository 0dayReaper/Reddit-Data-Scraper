    "postText": "So I was accepted and when I applied, I did not know what I wanted to do so I picked an undeclared major. I now know what Major I want to do. Is it easy to switch to my major as an admitted student? Can I do this at orientation? I have asked my counselor and she said I probably could but I wanted to see if anybody had a similar experience.",

But my major switch was within the same school. If you're undeclared within a school, the process is probably very quick. But if you're undeclared exploratory, there might be a few more hoops.",

I\u2019m not local but still instate and I looked down on this place as a budget way to get my degree.\n\nBut being here has paid off so much more than if I ever got into a school in DC. At least for govt programs I\u2019d argue we are comparable, and we rank 3rd in the nation for security studies (my main focus). In the year I\u2019ve been here I\u2019ve had a ton of networking opportunities, classes with really qualified people and I\u2019ve already made it to an elected position on a club here. \n\nI\u2019m really happy with what I\u2019ve done and what\u2019s to come. I know a lot of local students who commute probably hate it since maybe you aren\u2019t getting that traditional college experience. But experiences are different for everyone and if you can get involved then it\u2019s a lot better in the long run.",

The reason I don\u2019t like it here it because this school reminds me at every moment how little they care about anything but money. Construction at 8AM and year round because fuck our students. Food catered by a company that regularly gets people sick. Housing falling apart and covered in mold.  Quality of education is worse than the high school I went to for my core classes. Refusing to schedule enough classes for popular or required courses. Exorbitant pricing for things like parking. Lots of other general problems where GMU just says \u201cget fucked.\u201d \n\nI absolutely did not feel like this was worth the price I paid (I think JMU is similar and much better in most aspects). Only thing this place is good for is location and networking. I\u2019m sure other colleges have some of these issues but at least they have more school spirit + campus/Greek life to help make up for those problems since you\u2019re having fun. I also really don\u2019t wanna hear it about how \u201cjust join a club!\u201d or how you have to look for friends here. I\u2019m not interested in any of the clubs here and many young adults struggle to make friends already. College usually is supposed to make that a bit easier. Also I don\u2019t know what it is but this college has a lot of fucking weird people in proportion to other places I\u2019ve been. Whenever someone asks me where I go to college I honestly feel somewhat embarrassed to say I go here.",

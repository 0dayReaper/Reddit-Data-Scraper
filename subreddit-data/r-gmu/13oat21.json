Would the more expensive be overkill and can I go with the one below? Or do you have any Windows laptop recommendations? I have a desktop that I will be using which is decently powerful. Thank you!\n\n[https://www.costco.com/.product.1601624.html](https://www.costco.com/.product.1601624.html) [https://www.bestbuy.com/site/macbook-pro-14-laptop-apple-m1-pro-chip-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-space-gray/6450853.p?skuId=6450853](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/macbook-pro-14-laptop-apple-m1-pro-chip-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-space-gray/6450853.p?skuId=6450853)",

I can only imagine it being worse for an actual IT major. Save yourself the hassle and money, just get any 15-17\" windows laptop with 16 gigs of ram, separate number pad on the keyboard is usually a plus. This is what I would go with, as a good middle ground option, but if you have an extra couple hundred bucks to spend you can find one with better specs, or game performance if that's important to you.\n\nhttps://www.bestbuy.com/site/sku/6477889.p?skuId=6477889",

A lenovo ThinkPad will last you longer than your academic career at Mason and will work perfectly for coding. The battery life is amazing, as well as the speed and RAM when you get to selecting specs. \n\nI bought an Alienware laptop with a ryzen 9 5th gen, 3070, and 32gb of RAM.  while it's powerful, I'm actually going to be selling it because it's heavy and the battery lasts 2 hours despite the being on integrated graphics and utilizing no more than 30% of the CPU. So don't go with something like a desktop replacement. If you are looking for a powerful laptop, I recommend an Asus Zephyrus G14 since it's portable, powerful, and has long battery life. \n\nOverall, I reccomend getting a lenovo thinkpad. Also check out your local microcenter to check for deals on laptops",

The laptop I bought in 2017 is still great for everything I need done on a computer. I don't remember doing anything power intensive in my studies other than needing to run the Adobe Suite for one specific class. \n\nThere's many factors that go into this of course, but if you get a lower power cpu, all other things equal, your battery life will be better.

If I were to recommend, choose any windows or mac you desire, just aim for a high RAM (8gb+) which I believe is essential, the rest is just your own preference!",

As someone mentioned in the comments, I think using a Windows laptop would be better in the long run, since some classes require using Windows programs. But you should be fine either way!",

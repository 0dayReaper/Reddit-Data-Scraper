            "comment": "i did the opposite of you - i transferred from wm to gmu for cs. the price for what it was was not justifiable for me. it is super easy to double major at wm and computer science and business is a pretty popular combo - you would have to apply for the business school separately which can be a bit difficult. it is arguably harder to get around in williamsburg as the buses are unreliable - they\u2019ll randomly skip stops at times, but if you stick to popular destinations you should be fine. wm is starting the process of tearing down/rebuilding most of the dorms, so there\u2019s currently a lot of construction (way more than the sidewalk construction we get here). the class sizes are a lot smaller (the largest class i had was 40 people), so you\u2019d get better individualized support if you utilize office hours and stuff. as a sophomore, you\u2019d be required to live in the dorms which are a bit old and decrepit. a lot about wm is old and decrepit tho. i would stick with gmu as the debt you\u2019d accrue would not be worth it, but to each their own.",

WM and UVA are the only school in VA that can justify that price tag because employers love them. \n\nDouble majoring is hard at George Mason: I wanted to do CS+Business too but it's way too many credits here. If WM is better at double majoring then transfer there. The price tag, in the long run, will pay off imo bc even tho WM has similar connections in the CS world, but way better connections in the business world. DMV-wise GMU can compete but outside of it nobody really knows it. WM is a top college for a reason\n\nLook at WM's internship programs: it is second to none.",

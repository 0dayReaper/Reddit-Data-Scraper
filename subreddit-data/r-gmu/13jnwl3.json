TAs are decided by their department in January or February, so it might be too late for the upcoming school year. If you are considering the 24-25 school year, reach out to your professors and ask about TA opportunities.",

At that meeting they select the people who are the best fit for TA positions. If you have a graduate advisor I would reach out to them and ask about opportunities in your department.",

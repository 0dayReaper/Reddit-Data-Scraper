I'm assuming since you said 'i was placed' that you're a first year student since everyone else picks their own room. You don't get to play tradesies, you have to apply to get a different room, out of what's left. They're picky about accepting requests, and 'i don't want a roommate' is probably not gonna cut it. Also, freshmen are required to live in a learning community, and you can't leave it.",

Reason to why I said \u201cI was placed\u201d is because I wasn\u2019t able to apply for housing before and applied later on and they just placed me in any dorm that was available. The option for a pre arrival room change is not available only the pre arrival room swap option is what is available rn.",

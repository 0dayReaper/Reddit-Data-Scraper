Atop that I haven't been in school for 8 years now. You know my circumstance. Looking for someone to help get me spun up in addition to the introductory reading I'm doing in my free time.\n\nCheers\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: thanks to everyone for reaching out. I've received many requests for tutelage in maths. If anyone can help me in finance, please let me know.\n\nEdit2: received many requests to chat. I'm on mobile and going to work so it will take me some time to respond there",

It seems like fun but I also didn't have time for required meetings with sisters due to the busy schedule I have (work+classes). If you have the extra money and time I say go for it! If not, there are a good amount of clubs out there that can also get you connections/networking opportunities. Going to more events/club meetings is also a great way to know more people.",

However I\u2019m an off campus full time student w a job and I volunteer, so it wasn\u2019t looking realistic for me with my scheduling. Self care is important too! Plus the dues were a bit perplexing to me, classes and textbooks (+everyday costs) are already enough for me. I just couldn\u2019t justify the cost. \n\n\nMaybe in another life though!",

I never felt I was \u201cpaying for friends\u201d as you can see exactly where the money goes,  into philanthropy and programming for members.  (So you don\u2019t get charged for individual events, as with clubs.). Go through rush and try it - and if it\u2019s not for you, no big deal!  I worked 25ish hours per week and did the sorority, while pulling down a 3.5 GPA.  (Scholarship is important to a lot of green organizations and we had study halls while pledging to help us balance.). I was also a volunteer Young Life leader at a Fairfax county high school while doing all this.  It may not be for everyone, but you can\u2019t tell whether it\u2019s for you or not until you try it. \ud83d\ude0a",

Just know you\u2019re looking at 100s per semester bc dues. Heard it can also be time consuming bc of philanthropy. I will say it\u2019s definitely a good way to meet new people.",

Experiences are interchangeable and if ppl are going to cancel Greek life then you might as well cancel all social things at mason. It\u2019s usually the people who never joined a Greek life organization at mason that have the most to say. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking into it then chances are it\u2019s grasped your interest , might as well go for it and experience things for yourself",

This is just one thing out of a semester of fun.\n\nThey are your support system and family away from home. \n\nJoin the correct greek organization and you WILL get a ton out of it.\n\nFor panhel i would stick to.

    "postText": "This was my first semester staying on campus, and I got charged for \"two sessions\" for a double, so around $8,500. I didn't know what that meant and just figured that each session was half of the semester. I went to sign up for housing for this fall, and when I confirmed payment, it showed again that I would be billed for two sessions, only now these two sessions count as two separate semesters (a year) for around the same price I paid before. Therefore, even though I've only been here for one semester, I was charged for two at the beginning. I'm not staying in the same place this fall, so I know this isn't right and rightfully I should be in place for a refund for half of my spring housing payment. I've tried emailing housing/residence life to work this out a few times but no one ever responds. I don't know what to do. Where else should I email?",

I've tried emailing a couple different people outside of housing/residence life, and all of them have essentially said \"that isn't my job\" and redirecting me back to housing/residence life where no one responds. It's been very frrustrating.",

People get a lot more \"helpful\" when your within spitting range lmao. Seriously though, definitely print out the bill, and proof of this being your only semester. Bc that's a straight up scam",

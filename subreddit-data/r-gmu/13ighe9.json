I didn\u2019t see anyone I recognized(ok a few but still). You write how to pronounce your name on the card and your major/degree. That\u2019s it. You go on stage, shake hands, again with people you\u2019ve met once at most, and that\u2019s it. You could theoretically do this for any ceremony. It\u2019s made to be error proof. My name wasn\u2019t in the pamphlet, but I graduated anyway. By all means, walk, and have fun",

Some classes are still doing finals, and we have to grade those, plus whatever we have left from the semester. If you have a final tomorrow, or even today, you probably won't see that grade until after you walk.",

I was wondering if anyone know what we would get at the event? like a diploma? a card? a bag?\n\nEdit/Addition: can alumni tell me their experience at previous school of business degree celebration?",

Prior to the start of the event, you\u2019re given a small slip of paper to write your name and how to pronounce it; when you walk on stage, you give it to an announcer. The order of graduates for announcement is first come, first serve: the earlier you get to campus and line up before the ceremony, the earlier you get to walk the stage.\n\nI just graduated yesterday, both of my sisters and my father have previously graduated from mason, and this was the routine for all of our graduations.",

            "comment": "If you've defaulted on your student loans, the entire unpaid balance of your loan and any interest you owe becomes immediately due. You can no longer receive deferment or forbearance, and you lose eligibility for other benefits, such as federal financial student aid. You could try getting in contact with the financial aid office, but I doubt they'll be much help - they'll probably point you in the direction of some third-party creditor.\n\nCurrently,  according to Mason's website, it's not looking good.\n\n&gt;Courts have issued orders blocking the student debt relief program. As a result, at this time, applications are not being accepted. The Department of Education is seeking to overturn those orders. If you've already applied, they will hold your application. The rest of the information on this page is expected to be applicable again when debt relief resumes\n\nYou could try applying to the PSLF program (https://hr.gmu.edu/public-service-loan-forgiveness-program/#:~:text=The%20PSLF%20Program%20forgives%20the,time%20for%20a%20qualifying%20employer)",

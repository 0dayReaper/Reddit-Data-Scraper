I saw that I could purchase the voucher for like $400 directly from CompTia but it\u2019s a bit more than id like to spend right now. If anyone knows feel free to drop a comment! (also same goes if you guys know about cheaper exam vouchers for a+ exam and network+)",

I was also a big fan of Prof Messer's YouTube content but it's been a long time since I took the Sec+. I've never given a cent to any classes or non-official materials but that's just me",

In addition, you can renew the cert via cermaster ce for $199, and the renewal quizzes that you take are a joke. Also, I saw someone already mention the comptia student discount store, but check also if taking classes at mason might cover an exam voucher. I believe nvcc has IT classes that do so. Hope this helps!",

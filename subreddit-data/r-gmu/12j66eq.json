    "postText": "Hi!I'm planning out my fall semester right now since registration is opening up. But regarding my classes this fall, I'm missing out on the first two weeks due to being out of the country. So I wanted to know if my courses were doable despite missing out in the beginning a little (I def plan to take at least 2-3/5 classes online though so it's easier to manage).\n\n\\- HAP 360, ECON 103, ENGH 302, CDS 101(?), HAP 395\n\nIf there are any good professors you guys know I should specifically take regarding these courses or any easy natural science class to take (since i dont have to take CDS) please tell ! Anything helps really :')\n\nalso im health informatics bs major",

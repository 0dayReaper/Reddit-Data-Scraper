    "postText": "I just got off the waitlist for ECON 104 with Rustici ONLINE for this coming summer semester (Summer 2023), I've heard nothing but terrible, terrible things about him, and really need to pass ECON. It's online which makes me think it may be a little easier, however, I am a History major and ECON is NOT my strong suit in the slightest so I am preparing to struggle. I have already registered for ECON in the Fall 2023 semester with a different professor just in case I decide not to take it over the summer. Does anyone have any thoughts?",

He\u2019s very lax, only 3 he assignments the entire semester, only 2 exams which he gives you study guides for, and will randomly give out extra credit in class. He\u2019s a very good lecturer and will take the time to pause and help students who are having trouble, and goes over the entire chapter and not just small bits of it.\n\nI\u2019m not good at Econ either but this class was a breeze for me. As long as you do your reading you\u2019ll do fine.",

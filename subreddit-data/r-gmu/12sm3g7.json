A lot of these classes are \u201c3 credits\u201d but if you actually count the amount of time you spend, theyre sometimes more like 5. Head over to the ECE Discord server too, lots of good advice there.",

Keep in mind, this is basically 4 labs, since 350 is like all labs, but it is an easy course. 286/321 combo is a good one since there is overlap there.  I would say the challenge in this schedule would be STAT, especially with Sutton. 333 can be harsh too if you don't keep up, but I liked the material and thought it was a breeze. He curves a lot at the end so don't worry so much.\n\nGood luck!",

Is it actually useful or is it similar to 104 and 105 where it is old and outdated(basically useless information).\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out if this department is even worth it down the line or just make IT a minor.",

            "comment": "Senior here - It really depends on an individual basis. IT 104 is the most basic IT course and the difficulty quickly ramps up from there. On the whole, my professors have been really good. I've really only had 2 bad teachers in my entire time here, specifically Islam and Lyons (but ive mostly been able to select great teachers). The classes have been mostly good, with a couple being poorly organized (see 207/341), and some being downright terrible (see IT-213). But on the whole, I'm satisfied with Mason's IT program.",

The IT major isn\u2019t a solely programming focused major. You\u2019ll learn about networking, cybersecurity, businesses and programming. If you want a more targeted major, go with compsci. If you want a little bit of everything go with IT.",

            "comment": "It really depends on the class. 104/105 are definitely not the norm for 200 level and higher. As an example, IT341 is a networking course, and is set up as an introduction to the CCNA cert, though it does not cover the entirety of that material.\n\nI found the 200 level concentration gateway courses to be somewhat shallow; however that is probably by design as each of those is a short survey of what you would be studying in those concentrations.\n\nSo far the concentration 300/400 courses and some of the more hands-on mandatory courses have been interesting and pretty high quality. I\u2019m doing the DTP concentration, so YMMV in the other options, though I have heard good things about the cyber concentration in particular.",

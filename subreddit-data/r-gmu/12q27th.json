    "postText": "Any one else feel a little lost sometimes with the amount of platforms that are used for class stuff? \n\nLike how a class might use Piazza, Blackboard, Email, and now Discord for giving out information and updates. It's all great but I feel like I miss important info sometimes. For example, I've been waiting on grades to be posted to BB for a project and turns out there was an email I never saw that gave the grade. Another time an update to a project was posted to piazza for how to submit it and it never came up in class or an email (missed the Piazza email because I turned those off after having them on for a Intro to CS class). \n\nJust kind of wish everything was in one place. Having to check multiple different places for files and announcements is frustrating.",

I know the semester is almost over but you should speak up to your professors about keeping the assignments on blackboard. Mason pays so much money into anways, we might as well use it. \n\nP.S. I was on your page and saw a 20 min video about long long man. Kind of funny btw",

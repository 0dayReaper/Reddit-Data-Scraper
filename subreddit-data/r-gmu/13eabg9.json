I have gotten a notice about possibly missing a credit but I got it worked out by taking a exam for credit which is getting processed and corrected for my degree. I haven\u2019t gotten any further notice on whether I am cleared and all the advisors for my program have no walk in appts. I just wanted to ask cause I am having trouble finding out, and definitely want to confirm that I will be able to walk for graduation :)",

    "postText": "Hey, so I'm gonna be really honest I've lived off campus my whole life and worked literally the entire time I was in school and I have 0 friends to move out with. I have no idea how to figure out how to find a roommate and I don't have anyone within my current major (masters in art education) that I can move out with because lets be real most of them are already married with their own places. I need help finding out where to find roommates so that I'm able to move out of my parents house hopefully as soon as I get my first teaching job after my student internship and I have no idea where to look for this kind of stuff. Any advice and I'm willing to take it.",

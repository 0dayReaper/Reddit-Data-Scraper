Idk if that\u2019s repeated for A and B but if so, that\u2019s actually kinda awesome!\n\nOne of my professors just doesn\u2019t use +- like the rest of the school, but he did the math and found that it raises the average grade. While that sucks if you have an 89 or 79 or something, it helps on average. So eh, I\u2019ll take it.\n\nEdit: also I don\u2019t go here, no idea why tf this popped up in my Reddit feed lmao.

All the assignments have due dates, but the actual due date for assignments of a unit is before each unit test. You can choose when to do the assignments, but it has to be before the test; it's like a free extension for everyone. No excuse there, you have like 1 month and a half to do the each unit assignments. \n\nAnd then the tests, you get to drop the one with the worst grade. No make up tests, but you have the chance to screw up one test.\n\nShe basically is one step ahead of any student eventuality that may arise.",

If it doesn\u2019t, and grading was never discussed in class, then I\u2019d consider going back to the prof and present findings.\n\nIf the syllabus DOES state the prof\u2019s grading policy (and it almost certainly does), and/or the prof presented grading during class, then, well, if it\u2019s that important to get the better grade, I\u2019d consider tell the prof that I\u2019ll be back next semester to try for that better grade, and thank the prof for their time responding. And that time, work hard and get the A+.\n\nThe Plus comes because you read the syllabus, paying attention in class, asking questions, helping others, maybe forming a study group, and of course showing up to class on time, prepared, turn your work in early or on time, and you study and do well on exams. It\u2019s really very simple.",

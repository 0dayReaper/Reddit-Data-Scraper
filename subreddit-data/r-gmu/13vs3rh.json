I\u2019m a senior now but I have failed a couple classes on the way, but I will graduate. \n\nAt GMU you will run into people who are extremely smart, who \u201cgot it\u201d and people like me who may have to work twice as hard to achieve the same results.\n\nThe reason why I say that is because the people who are smart have been programming for years (since high school or maybe even middle school) so the experience is there, they have already been met with the struggles and overcame it, that\u2019s why they can finish projects very quickly. \n\nNow there\u2019s me and possibly you\u2026. who started programming at CS100 (whatever the intro programming class is at NOVA) and that\u2019s where my experience is, so give or take its lower than most people I run into. \n\nWith that being said if you can see yourself if the tech field and coding, push on through because you have passed the same course the second time, meaning that with hard work and gained knowledge, you\u2019re with your peers. \n\nI think you should really push through to continue with success, college is never about racing. Learn the material and master it so at a job the employer can\u2019t come up with an excuse.",

I would also avoid listening to people saying how easy such-in-such was. That would only bring you down. I won't tell you to stay or leave. That is something that you have to decide. Try to visualize where you want to be.  If you do decide to stay the course, I would be happy to try to help in you in future CS work.",

If you genuinely love it and can see yourself doing this as a career, that will motivate you to do whatever it takes. If that means taking advantage of tutoring, going to a ton of office hours. Which is the best-kept secret, in my opinion. Also, watching videos, buying books, taking courses online, whatever it takes.

If you\u2019re failing tests, then the tests required more preparation. Are you prepared to trudge through the tedium it might require in order to pass those tests? If so, go for it. If you\u2019re not, which, ya know, that\u2019s perfectly fine too, then perhaps consider switching into something related but easier. IT, data science, etc might be more your speed.",

            "comment": "Hello! I was once a computer engineering major and shortly after, I dropped to CS. I did horrible and then realized that I am definitely better suited for IT. The IT curriculum was by no means, easy. But after 3 years of hard work, crying, and stressing, I only have 1 more class before I graduate this December.\n\nDon't be too upset about failing a couple of CS classes and remember to take it easy on yourself. I've convinced a couple of my friends and fellow classmates to follow me into IT, and we're all doing better than ever. Come to IT!! We have many concentrations like programming (dtp), health IT, cybersecurity, cloud, telecomm, and multimedia! \n\nGood luck and don't forget to relax a little bit!",

            "comment": "I would consider switching to IT if you want to stay in tech.\nThere are a lot of people giving you a pep talk, but 112 and 211 are intro level courses. 310, 262, 367, and (especially if you're not great at math) 330 and 483 are going to be harder then those, each and all. You might do better to take yourself out of that situation before getting further into it.\n\nIT can be a lucrative career field, and if you take the cloud specialty you could still end up as a solutions architect or some similar role, but without paying out the ass for repeating failed courses.",

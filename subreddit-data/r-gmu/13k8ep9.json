It might be stuck, but it should give. Lift it up and your spare tire should be there along with the jack and the lug wrench (the X looking tool). \n\nWatch a video on on how to take it off and lift your car using the jack. It might be kinda difficult taking off the tire bolts but they\u2019ll come off.",

It was either this, or the spare tire, so it depends on what package you get in a car.",

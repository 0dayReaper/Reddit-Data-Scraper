This is why more than a majority of professors are adjuncts and use English as their 2nd language. The plus side is that if your Professor uses English as a 2nd language, they are most often found to be incredibly intelligent within their field, unlike the professors who speak English primarily. It seems to be this school's dynamics; balancing how smart someone is versus how well they can teach or speak English. If money tells them to be Conservative, they will happily reply, \"How much?\".",

Description:

The unofficial community subreddit for students, faculty, alumni, and friends of George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia.

Rules:

Don't be a jerk: If you're unpleasant, mods will ban you.

Posts must be relevant to GMU: Please only post anything relevant to GMU or the surrounding NoVA area. High quality posts only.

Abide by the GMU Honor Code: Do not advocate for cheating; do not ask students on answers to homework/lab assignments, quizzes, and exams.

Avoid duplicate posting: This prevents posts from being clogged and allows for more focused discussion. Be sure to search what you plan to ask by searching throughout the subreddit or check the wiki before posting.

No self-promoting: Any and all posts that promote something not related to GMU without proper permission will be removed. For class assignments, please clarify in the title or comment of your post what class this is for (ex. SYST 469). If you want to promote anything that isn't related to GMU, please PM the mods for permission to post.

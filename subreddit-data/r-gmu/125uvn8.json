            "comment": "302: take Larson. Easy to get an A, all of the assignments go toward the final persuasive paper which made the paper so easy, fantastic class (and I hate English lol)\n\n216: currently taking with foster, 150% do not take anyone else lol\n\nSTAT250: is gonna suck either way. I had pasiah, and class wasn\u2019t mandatory so I just taught myself thru the book. There was a lot of assignments.\n\n207: currently taking with mallampati: not a bad professor, he\u2019s extended our deadlines frequently, but the labs can take a while to do - so it\u2019s work heavy.\n\n223: I had Leary and she was great. I am not super big into cyber security, but she made it bearable and easy to pass with little effort.\n\n300: lots of information, not a ton of assignments, but the midterm &amp; final are hard. You need the book. If you\u2019re gonna put in effort, this class will require a lot of time for understanding concepts.\n\n314: in it currently with pavlenko, and it\u2019s basically 214 with oracle instead lol.\n\n315: in it now with almeida, it\u2019s pretty easy and actually fun. I have a Mac so idk what it\u2019s like with Mac in the cloud for windows but, I\u2019ve enjoyed it and it\u2019s minimal effort.\n\n343: in it now with miller, he makes it pretty smooth and easy. All of the big projects are after the midterm, so before is skate. Basically the only grades are midterm/final, IT Project proposal, research paper, and group presentation. Just don\u2019t get behind\u2026 lol\n\nOnly one I haven\u2019t taken obviously is 342. That\u2019s next semester for me.\n\nMy semesters have been this:\n\n* 302/102/104/105/hist125\n* 109/214/223/300/MBUS\n* STAT250/341/209/213\n* 207/216/314/315/343\n\nI work full time as well. My most stressful semester was probably the third one (with STAT250) because of how much work each class that semester required.",

            "comment": "Are you working 40 hours a week?\n\nI took 6.5 years to get out undergrad, starting working at Dulles Airport (MWAA) as a summer intern then too a full time job my last senior year.  \n\nI wouldn\u2019t do more than 3 classes a semester. STAT250 was a tough one from I remember. My undergrad was in the Volgneau school of engineering. Applied IT. I went back right away and got my masters before I turned 30. They moved the degree from Volgneau to the business school and it went from $18k to $54k last time I checked. \n\nNot sure how the IT classes are now, but I was living with my parents close to Fairfax and then when I took the 300 level classes it all went to PW campus. \n\nKnock out all the electives, and STAT and 200 level IT classes first. Then once you get in a good rhythm, take 3 300 classes a semester if you can.",

Also good to be under 30 hours a week so you have time to study. I did the cybersecurity concentration, been in cyber since I graduated. Would recommend it to everyone.",

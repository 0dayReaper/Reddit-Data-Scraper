    "postText": "Okay, I know the title sounds weird. I have a 'project' due for my Linguistics class where I have to record someone who a) English is not their first language and b) has an accent. It's not difficult, you just need to answer a few standard questions (what's your name, what other languages do you speak, etc.) and then I need a recording of the person reading aloud a specific paragraph. If anyone is willing to help me, I will pay you $20 for your troubles ($10 for helping me out, another $10 if the recording is accepted). PM me if interested please!",

It may be a lot coupled with Anatomy and Calculus. I wouldn\u2019t let that deter you if you are okay with not having a lot of free time, just know that it will require a lot of work because the papers for BIOL 308 can be tricky depending on the professor",

If math is frustrating for you id say either replace calc w something easier or one of the bio classes. \n\nBIOL 430 has weekly lab quizzes and exams have a lot of content but it was my fav class (take hunnell for lecture!) Also lab practicals: memorizing almost every bone in the body, &amp; 2 muscle practicals. Not difficult per say BUT VERY TIME CONSUMING to study for\n\nBiol 308 has intensive lab, you have a weekly writing assignment and in class lab due. The lecture isn\u2019t difficult but again ALOT of content. Take hanley, avoid crerar if possible. The in lab assignments can be tricky but not impossible. For writing, the assignments vary word limit but there\u2019s a research paper due at the end of the semester",

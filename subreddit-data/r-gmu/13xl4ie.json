            "comment": "Brother a few years ago I did an internship with a company and it went really well. About 30 people got in and 2 were going to get to stay on for an extended internship that might develop into something more potentially. The internship ended, as far as I could tell I did the best work, and someone on my team who didn\u2019t work as hard got one of the spots. And I didn\u2019t get any notice. Whatever, was just grateful for the experience. A few weeks later, they invite me back for a company trivia game hosted online during Covid. Didn\u2019t know why they invited me but I joined and it was a good time. On the call, the other intern asked if I was still interested in the other spot and that it was open for me if I wanted it. I said yes. After that, didn\u2019t hear anything back. Figured that maybe their initiatives just changed. About 2 months ago I was looking over my resume to update it with my current experience. I decided to create a new email address because that one I had was a bit cluttered. I then realized that I already had another address that I created as a business address. And I had given it to that company and then forgot that it existed\u2026. In the inbox, I had a bunch of emails from the company introducing me to the team as a continued member and what my role was going to be. I never saw any of it at the time. Years later though, the person who tried to recruit me is gone from the company, I have a good professional relationship with another member who ended up leaving, and still no one knows that I just never saw the email. Was a terrible look and I still cringe about it, but it didn\u2019t hurt my career at all. You\u2019re fine. Don\u2019t stress about it. But do try to keep as good of relationships as you can and try to circle back around with people and not leave them hanging.",

The idea of landing something and not knowing about it until after the opportunity has passed sounds excruciatingly worse than the normal rejection.",

They only care about getting people in the door and they realize ghosting happens (it happens both ways anyway)\nUnless you do something signicantly uncalled for, most recruiters will probably just move on to the next potential applicant and wont even think anything of it.",

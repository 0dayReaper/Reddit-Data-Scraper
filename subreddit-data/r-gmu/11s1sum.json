    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m working on a fieldwork project on the experiences and personal narratives of transgender and gender nonconforming people at Mason. For part of this research, I will be conducting interviews with Mason students that are trans and gender nonconforming. The primary topic of the interviews is experience with mental health services (and access to them) but more lighthearted questions such as ones experience with expressing gender through clothing, which is a larger research interest of mine, will be present as well.\n\nIf you or anyone you know is interested in participating, please reach out to me, I\u2019d love to sit down with you (either in person or virtually). That being said, if you want to participate but wish to remain anonymous to my professor and in my notes, that is absolutely fine. Anonymity is not an issue. \u00a0\n\nThank you so much! I look forward to hearing from you guys!\n\nCharlie M.\n\n*They/them/theirs*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease contact me at mmeyer24@gmu.edu",

I'm hoping to go to GMU next year - just waiting on some scholarship info to let me know if it'll be feasible. If anyone is willing to give me some info/advice for me I'd really appreciate it!\n\n(I hope it's okay to leave this comment here - I don't mean to get off topic from your research - good luck with it!)",

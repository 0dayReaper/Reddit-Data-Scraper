If you're on campus on 5/16 and want a fridge hmu. It works well, has a little freezer section as well. It's a bud dusty but I'll clean it up before handing it over. \n\nIf no one wants it then I'll probably drop it off at Goodwill or something\n\n\nEdit: someone already messaged me so you can ignore the post.",

When I was still enrolled in Nvcc, my chosen major was Information Technology just because it is a lot easier to get into IT then vice versa. Engineering is more math heavy if you can't handle the workload, I say that if you have a preferred interest in what you're trying to do and career goals, you should aim to do just that.",

    "postText": "okay i looove leaving reviews for my professors after i finish all my finals so i was making my way to review epstein's bio class because that class ngl was pretty difficult (but i worked around it) and wanted to give tips on how to succeed in her class. \n\nbut holy heck, i remember when i first was deciding bio professors, she had pretty good reviews and relatively lots of greens and people saying she's good. but now that im checking it, her reviews are literally all reds LOL. what on earth happened in her other classes to make people so riled?... i cant tell if its one person or multiple that seem upset with her but its crazy how her reviews changed so fast this semester",

            "comment": "I actually liked her. She allowed you to take exams at the testing center or in class on a laptop with lockdown browser (whichever fit your schedule), replaced an exam grade if it was lower than your final, or replaced your final with your midterm average. I didn't have to take her final this semester because of her policy and I walked out with a B just studying before exams. I don't understand the hate, she is nice too.",

My biggest problem was that we were told that the final exam didn\u2019t affect our grade but then we\u2019re told that it did. I had a panic attack over it. The class is 90% based on exams which I personally hate. No projects, just one weekly assignment. As a prof she is very nice and understanding and good at explaining things, but the set up of the class I was not a fan of.",

Her teaching style isn't for everyone though, which I totally understand, so maybe that was just a wave of people who didn't mesh well with her lol. There's also always the wave of people who didn't put in any effort to the class and therefore didn't do well and blame it on the prof. Both happen haha",

I\u2019m so so thankful for that.\n\nThe average for the first three exams, which are all multiple choice, can replace the final cumulative exam if it happens to be higher than the final.",

    "postText": "So I'm a CS Major looking into transferring into IT. Specifically in the WADV concentration (Web Application Development). That area of mobile, web development is much more interesting to me and I'm already in tune with the UI UX area so I'm hoping to launch off from there. \n\nIs there any insight from IT majors currently/ had with the concentration? How was it? I see on the reddit most people are saying the concentration is outdated, is that still true?",

The programming courses for the DTP concentration are a much higher quality than webdev. Also from what i heard, a lot of the webdev courses are out of date and really basic in terms of concepts.",

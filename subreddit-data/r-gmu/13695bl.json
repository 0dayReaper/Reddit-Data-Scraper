I will be in the Johnson Center, and I will be sat at one of the tables.\n\nDon\u2019t solicit me for eggs if you\u2019re just going to waste them, don\u2019t throw them at any walls or statues, or your fraternity for fundraising.\n\nThey are explicitly to be eaten and nothing else. If you can\u2019t assure me of that, I will not let you have any. See you all tomorrow.",

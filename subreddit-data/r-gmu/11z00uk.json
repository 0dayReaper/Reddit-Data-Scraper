If possible we\u2019d love to have a cat, but don\u2019t know if there is a difference in policy regarding on-campus and off-campus mason affiliated housing\u2026 \n\nI know that traditional dorms allow fish w/regulations attached, but do the townhomes have these same regulations????",

Either way, if any of you struggle with any sort of chronic illness, physical or mental you can try to get them to become an esa. One major issue with that is that you do have to have the cat before you can make them an esa. If you're doing it through mason theres a crazy amount of paperwork and they reserve the right to reject animals. If its not owned by george mason itself, then I would reach out to the leaser and ask about pets and esas and what are allowed.",

If they have a website for the townhomes that you're renting, then I would check that out because they often have rules such as that on there.",

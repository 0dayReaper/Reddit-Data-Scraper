            "comment": "Depends what you wanna do. Do you want something more IT or more business? Every IT/tech company in the area will have some business/front end positions as well. Any large contractor you can think of exists here. Leidos, General Dynamics, SAIC, CACI, CGI, Booze Allen Hamilton, Amazon, MITRE, banks/credit unions, Oracle, Google, Microsoft... \n\nYou name it, we got it. Get your resume set up to fit a couple positions you're interested in and apply to any internship or co-op situation you see that largely matches what interests you. \n\nI would also strongly suggest applying to government positions. For example, NASA HQ in DC is very heavily focused on policy and business work for all NASA centers. All agencies need business related work on technical systems. For government jobs I would say check USA Jobs. Pathways internships are a pathway to full hire if you can get one of those. Otherwise there are standard one summer internships as well.\n\nOverall, just search titles you're interested in with internship after them and apply. Handshake is a great platform for finding internships and entry level positions specifically for college students and very recent grads. I got offers and my current job through there. Glassdoor, Indeed, LinkedIn, etc as well.",

Currently working an accounting internship and got a full time offer from the company recently. Apply to everything and something will eventually happen. Even if it\u2019s not what you want to do, once you get experience applying becomes a lot easier",

I have been looking and it\u2019s been difficult as an MIS major myself, seems like most of the roles I get interviewed for or offered are less than desirable business roles.",

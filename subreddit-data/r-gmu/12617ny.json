    "postText": "Hi y'all,\n\nI am currently a senior in the IT program and I am also in the BAM for Digital Forensics. I am trying to decide if I should continue with my master's after my bachelor's degree.\n\nI will need 21 credits after my bachelor's. If I do continue with it I would like to do it as fast as possible, which would be 12 credits one semester and 9 the next. Is this doable? Are the classes too difficult to take 12 credits at a time? I am in DFOR 510 right now and it is one of my easier classes out of the ones I am taking this semester, but it is also the intro graduate class.\n\nIf someone could give some insight into if 12 credits in one semester is doable for this program, or if it is worth adding an extra year for a master's degree at all. \n\nThanks!",

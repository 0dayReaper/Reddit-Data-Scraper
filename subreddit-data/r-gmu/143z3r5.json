    "postText": "*Dear Mason Community,*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a university that is supposedly inclusive and respectful of those who are different, ***we have an ableism problem***. I'm a disabled GMU student, and I personally have experienced a wide range of problems on campus. Judging by my conversations with my fellow Mason students and reading some other posts on this sub, I am far from the only one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a tic disorder, a disability that causes involuntary muscle movements and vocalizations, and it has caused me so many problems at GMU. Dramatically more so than when I've been out shopping or just out in public in general.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMason students have told me things like:\n\n* Being within earshot of me is comparable to being punched in the face.\n* I should be forced to live in a soundproof room so that people won't have to be subjected to me.\n* I am incredibly entitled for wanting to be treated like a normal person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA student recorded a video of me and posted it online for people to laugh at, and I was told by a user on this sub that wanting the student to face disciplinary action for it was ridiculous because \"all they did was record a video in a public place.\" A professor once called me an asshole in front of the entire online class for accidentally unmuting my mic while ticcing, initially didn't believe me when I told him I had a condition, and did nothing to stop classmates from mocking me. GMU police were called on me multiple times, and one time someone even followed me to relay my every move to police because they thought I was a \"threat.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisabled students like myself deserve to be treated just as well as everyone else. We are completely normal people who are just trying to get a damn education, and we don't deserve the unwelcoming, and sometimes outright hostile treatment that we have faced from a select few of our fellow Mason students and users on this sub.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**We're better than this.**",

I would console the disabilities resource office: https://accessibility.gmu.edu/services/ talk to someone (don\u2019t know if you have). If they\u2019re worth anything they should be able to assist you and help make your remaining time more comfortable. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been getting the short end of the stick with your experience at Mason so far. I promise there are people who aren\u2019t total crap. I had a guy this semester who had a disability and none of the class gave him problems or bothered him. We let him be.",

Is anyone here a university scholar I can DM or ask questions to?\n\nI\u2019m currently tasked with choosing GMU full tuition scholarship versus UVA for cybersecurity major which is coming out to be a hard decision!",

I'm sure that's a large part of the decision making, the \"prestige\" of UVA. Imo, I would never go to UVA bc the campus is trash to walk through (it's literally integrated with the traffic in Charlottesville) and the insides of the actual classrooms are trash, think highschool that hasn't been renovated since 1980. That's ou my opinion though, just know that if you're the kind of go--getter to even receive the option of a full ride scholarship, you'll be fine with whatever it is you decide to do, even not going to college!",

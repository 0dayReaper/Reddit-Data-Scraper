    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m an incoming freshman and i\u2019m trying to decide between the dorms. The panther hall shared dorms look more modern and new, rather the the private bedrooms in lake view which look older. I would prefer my own bedroom but I can sacrifice that for a nicer space. Distance to campus also plays a major role for me. If anyone could give me some advice that would be amazing!",

FIU is one of the few colleges (from ones I know) where freshmen have the choice to stay in a private room without paying an arm and a leg, so might as well take advantage of that! I haven't been to Panther Hall, but from the looks, they also look about the same. Personally, I'd sacrifice a nicer space anyday anywhere to not have to share my room, but your preference can always vary of course. (P.S. Just an fyi, people can be hella nasty in the dorms; especially the freshman ones like Lakeview/Panther).\n\nDistance to rest of the campus is practically the same.",

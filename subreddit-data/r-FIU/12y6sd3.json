At most fiu will give you a tiny tablet for free I believe but no fiu will not give you a laptop or anything like that even with their extremely expensive tuition \ud83d\ude2dthey do have a store that sells laptops and stuff there as well if you\u2019d prefer to buy a laptop or something there. You\u2019re better off buying and having your own laptop for fiu.",

Either way you should get a performance increase.",

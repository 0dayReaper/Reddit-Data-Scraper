However, I found it through a Google search and thought I should share with everyone in case there\u2019s a professor you aren\u2019t sure you should take a course with this semester or if this isn\u2019t actually common knowledge.\nIt looks like you can search based off of a professors name, campus, course number, and even by year. \n\n[SPOT Survey Results Link](https://opir.fiu.edu/faculty-evaluations.htm)\n\nIn case the link stops working, I\u2019ve included a link to a PDF with all of the results from professors in the academic year 2022-2023.\n[SPOT Survey Results PDF Link](https://fiudit-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/kweit003_fiu_edu/ES7ZtqylpyJIvvIe-y-fZXAB-XmOrVKTGFnToA-n21KHWA?e=UY22uL)",

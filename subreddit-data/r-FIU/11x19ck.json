    "postText": "Hi all. If you or anyone you know is looking for a job that pays well and they don\u2019t have to commit their time during the week too, send me a PM. \n\nThe job position is a waiter/server position that includes setup for catering events around the Miami area. We send out requests on a weekly basis for our employees to either accept/decline jobs that fit their schedule. \n\nYou must have a solid means of transportation (preferably car) and be willing to learn the basics of being a server/bus boy/etc. \n\nMajority of jobs are on weekends and are at least a 6 hour shift, most being 10.",

I\u2019m on my third year and am having doubts; I\u2019m going to be doing student teaching/field experience soon and don\u2019t know if I want to do it. Is it too late to change? I don\u2019t know what I am going to change it to if I do decide to do that. I can just get a fine art degree but I don\u2019t know.. I don\u2019t know if I should stick through it or not.",

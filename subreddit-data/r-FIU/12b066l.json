            "comment": "Hi! I had this same question and got it answered! So the Office of Financial Aid deals with Bright Futures, not the Office of Scholarships, and according to them you only need 24 credits from Fall and Spring to be \"full time.\" Take a look at these links:\n\n[https://onestop.fiu.edu/finances/types-of-aid/scholarships/bright-futures/](https://onestop.fiu.edu/finances/types-of-aid/scholarships/bright-futures/)\n\n[https://www.floridastudentfinancialaidsg.org/SAPBFMAIN/SAPBFMAIN](https://www.floridastudentfinancialaidsg.org/SAPBFMAIN/SAPBFMAIN)\n\n(At the bottom of the last link there is an interactive tool to help you see whether you qualify for renewal based on the credits you've passed).\n\nI also clarified this with my advisor.\n\nOther scholarships may require 30 credits annually (many of the FIU merit scholarships do: [https://scholarships.fiu.edu/browse-scholarships/merit-scholarships/policies-renewal/](https://scholarships.fiu.edu/browse-scholarships/merit-scholarships/policies-renewal/)) but as far as I know you do not need 30 credits for Bright Futures, only 24 for both fall and spring to be \"full time.\" I believe the bare minimum is 6 credits in the fall and spring each though.\n\n(If you want to have summer credits covered by Bright Futures, you need to take a minimum of 6 credits, by the way. Otherwise you pay out of pocket).\n\nGive the Financial Aid office a ring or visit One Stop if you want to check for yourself.\n\nEdit: grammer",

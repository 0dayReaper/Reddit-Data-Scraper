    "postText": "Hey all basically due to circumstances I have the horrible grade of 32% in pre-calc right now. My prof already knows this and is offering me the option of taking a mini session over the winter break to get the grade needed to pass.  However as I am majoring in the sciences I'm afraid that this will make me fall behind in taking calc 1. So, what should I do? Retake the course the next semester or do this  stretch option? thoughts are appreciated!",

I did it once (still failed LOL) but had I passed it would\u2019ve been so much better than having to retake it. Imo, do the stretch option because even if you fail you can still just retake it the next semester if anything",

If you understand limits, you\u2019ll be ok! \n\nCalc 1 is mostly derivatives and limits. It does build from precalc, but there\u2019s a bit of Precalculus that you wouldn\u2019t really see in calc 1. If you\u2019re taking calculus 2, you need to focus on calc 1 and understand it well. Hopefully this helps!",

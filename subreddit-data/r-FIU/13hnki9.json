My academic advisor lied to me telling me that I needed to take this Spanish class to complete a minor, but I honestly would rather do a minor in math or in project management, even if it takes me a bit longer and I graduate by the time I'm 24. Is it worth pursing a minor?",

                    "comment": "&gt;If you\u2019re considering a minor in math why are you in the BA program? \n\nI took the BA in CS because I originally didn't have the prerequisites to go into the BS from what an academic advisor told me when I transferred over to FIU, and I tried to explain to them that I wanted to pursue the BS, but they didn't really let me and told me to stick with the BA which I regret. But now since I heard there's no difference between the BA and the BS in terms of job prospects, I stuck through with it.\n\n&gt;As the other guy said, minors are nice to have but are neither necessary or important. Do not overwork yourself, make personal projects in your spare time. Those add much more weight to your resume than a minor. Prioritize a high GPA so you can get a good internship, that\u2019s where you\u2019ll learn the most\n\nI'm gonna be real with you, I have been wanting to make personal projects, but I genuinely have no clue what personal projects I should make since there are so many fields to go into. My main interests have been game development, cybersecurity, or web development, but these fields seem to have a problem whenever I look up things about them.",

I didnt have to take \"extra\" classes in my case so it cost me nothing to officially declare the minor.",

The advisor just wanted me to pick a class that met the 9 credits torwards a major requirement.\n\nI genuinely am so stumped when it comes to picking a personal project to work on. I feel dumb cause I really want to pick something interesting but nothing seems to really click with me when it comes to personal projects.",

I believe theres a certificate program if you take like Chinese or Japanese language and I suppose that may be useful for you in the future but you'd have to look further into that.\n\nCheck your Panther Degree Audit frequently, and use the flowchart for BA in CS to see exactly what classes you need to graduate. When you meet with advisors, you should be insistent you already know what you want to take and do in the future, otherwise they will give generic advice you may regret later. Just my 2 cents on that.\n\nRegarding projects: Pick a topic you deeply care about, or something you have just a cursory interest in, and try to improve something in that space. I see you mentioned games, a common thing people do is start their own private Minecraft server on a Raspberry Pi (for example). Learn everything about that and you'll find you end up learning about more than just Minecraft.\n\nThen, since you also mentioned web development, why not deploy your own website to showcase your portfolio/resume? Consider it a living resume, or blog maybe, that you can centralize all your progress and hobbies and interests. You can do this for free, or close to it, using Cloudflare Pages or Github Pages.\n\nLastly, I can point you to cybersecurity resources as well, especially if you like tinkering with Raspberry Pis. Learning Linux and Bash/Powershell will open you up to a world of possibilities honestly.\n\nDM me if anything amigo, always happy to help.",

You see a lot of good players now opting out of the larger schools to get playing right away now, focusing on NFL career.",

I guarantee you could fill our stadium twice over with each American football fan at our school. \n\nThe problem is people are lazy and think they\u2019re \u201cdeprived\u201d of a college experience at FIU, so they take it out on things like athletics. These same people love and support other college programs more than their own. I go to the games and have friends that go and we tailgate. A lot of people don\u2019t have friends that go or do those things, so they don\u2019t either.\n\ne: And aside from my aforementioned points, I\u2019m sure our subreddit isn\u2019t the best place to make the appeal for our athletics programs. Reddit nerds and sports typically don\u2019t coincide with one another, and you unenthusiastic people make our school look bad.",

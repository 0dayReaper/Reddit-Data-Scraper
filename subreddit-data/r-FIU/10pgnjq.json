I want to know which university could give me a better job outlook and better pay and prestige. Ultimately I wanted to get into UM but even if I did I don\u2019t know how to pay for it so I\u2019m sticking between fiu and fsu for now.",

            "comment": "Companies really just want you to have a degree, school prestige likely won\u2019t matter unless you go to an Ivy League school. If it\u2019s important for you though, FSU is probably more prestigious. For job outlook FIU easily, as it\u2019s located in Miami many companies are looking at FIU for prospects. And for better pay after college, FIU is consistently ranked as the best return on investment in the state and one of the best roi in the country. If you\u2019re doing online school, FIU also is one of the best online schools in the state as well as the country. Campus wise, FSU has a nice and cozy feeling campus but I\u2019m not a fan of Tallahassee(I work there) as there\u2019s not much to do. On the other hand FIU\u2019s campus might be a bit underwhelming in the sense of \u201ccollege experience\u201d but the campus is nice as hell plus it\u2019s in Miami so you\u2019ll have plenty to do. As an added bonus, if you still want to transfer to UM later, being at FIU will be a much easier move than FSU to UM. Hope this helps and good luck in college!",

I was sad coming here originally because so many people don\u2019t think as FIU as a prestigious school, but it\u2019s an amazing school that gives you so many cool opportunities. It\u2019s also very diverse unlike FSU so there are many cool clubs. Also, like all the other comments say when people hire you they don\u2019t really care what college you went to, but they look at your credentials and I feel like Fiu could provide you with more experience and opportunities than FSU. I\u2019m currently a marine biology major and FIU has gotten me an opportunity to study sea turtles in Costa Rica for two weeks which I think is really cool overall, I think you should go with FIU",

Also, there's a bad culture where somehow UM is considered more Miami than FIU, when mostly UM is the children of rich white people who want to party. Worse, they come to Miami at UM, use the city like a womanizer uses a sweet girl, and then leave back to wherever it is. FIU students are fed this bullshit their whole life and so they perpetuate it, not realizing they're devaluing their own degree. FIU is a great school, it's genuinely a great research university, and if you're getting a stem/nursing/engineering/some degree that requires state liisencure, it doesn't matter where TF you end up at because your employer pays you off of the state license, not your degree.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSource: I employ people based off their state liisencure, I don't give a fuck where they went to school. I also grew up in Miami and was fed the same bullshit till I woke up sometime in the mid 2000's.",

I had the grades and means to attend UM or FIU but I chose FIU because it is more diverse. But after my first year at FIU, I noticed people around Florida would eye me a certain way when I said I went to FIU. However when I say to people up North how I went to FIU they think it\u2019s super cool",

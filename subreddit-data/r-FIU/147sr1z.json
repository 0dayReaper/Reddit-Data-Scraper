    "postText": "Hey y'all, I got accepted into FIU graduate school for MS in Mechanical Engineering in the Robotics track. I just got off a zoom call with the grad program advisor with a good set of classes to take my first semester. I'm registering far after everyone else has gone so understandably the classes are either completely gone or have one slot left. For EML 5808 Control Technology for Robotic Systems, there's only one slot left with a Prof. Abderrachid Hamrani. Rate my professor didn't have a lot of reviews for him, but they all weren't that great. I don't want to base my opinion on a couple of reviews though so I wanted to ask y'all: anyone had him before? What was he like? Would I be able to learn a lot in his class?",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I was wondering how the FIU Fly In Experience is. I have questions like : \n\n\\- How much money should students bring on the trip?\n\n\\-What is expected of students on the trip?\n\n\\-Are students allowed to explore the city? \n\nAnd anything else you think is relevant.",

            "comment": "Well FIU in DC now has a Reddit account to answer this (this sub isn\u2019t super active so hopefully you don\u2019t mind an official answer)! They\u2019re all a bit different but \n-Not too much is needed, some meals are included but some, usually dinner, are left to you. \n-Represent FIU and yourself well by asking great questions of guest speakers and setting yourself up for future internships or careers! Help us get the group everywhere on time, and get to know your peers on the trip! If applicable to your Fly-In consider earning the Digital Badges that will be made available to you. \n-The itineraries are pretty packed so there\u2019s not that much time to do things on your own but it is usually allowable to explore on your own after the day\u2019s itinerary ends (sometimes that\u2019s past 5!). Specific rules around staying in groups or when you need to be back at the hotel may vary depending on the FIU department sponsoring the travel. \n\nIf you have further questions about a specific fly in (there are many), email me at ericf@fiu.edu\n-Eric",

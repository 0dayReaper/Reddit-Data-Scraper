    "postText": "Hi! I have a couple questions regarding the MIS major at FIU. I live in Tallahassee and want to go to FSU for Management Information Systems but I got the chance to move to Miami in a good housing deal and wanted to apply to FIU. \n\nThe MIS major at FSU is a Bachelor of Science, while at FIU it is a BBA, also here at FSU the catalog includes data analytics classes like big data but the catalog for FIU doesn\u2019t, so I\u2019m wondering what is the \u201cinformation science\u201d portion of the FIU degree? Has anyone graduated from this degree in Miami and if so what is the experience ? I don\u2019t know how good is the reputation of FIU particularly in this area. If not I could do a Computer science BA at FIU, I know they are not super similar however when looking at the CS BA catalog I do see data classes. \n\nCan someone help me understand the catalogs?",

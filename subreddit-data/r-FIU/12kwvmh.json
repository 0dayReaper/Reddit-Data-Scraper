At best, the professor will fail you for the assignment; at worst, they can report you for academic misconduct and have you investigated by a disciplinary committee. Imagine being interrogated with your academic career (and potential expulsion) on the line. Colleges really don't like plagiarism.",

Plus they can tell--after reading 40 papers, these AI papers stick out like sore thumbs. \n\nChatGPT can help a ton in the writing process without it having to write the entire paper. Outlines for papers, formating references in any style, finding sources, etc.",

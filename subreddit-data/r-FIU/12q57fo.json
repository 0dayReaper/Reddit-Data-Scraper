I have my two associates degrees and am attending in the fall for my bachelors in marine bio, but they are making me retake my algebra, both of my chemistries, and all of my biology courses. I even brought it up and submitted all of my syllabi to the various departments, but nothing changed.",

MAC 1105 and MAC 1147 are prerequisites to the calculus sequence for Electrical Engineering, so unless you have taken equivalent courses you\u2019ll need them. Not sure about Bio - you might need it depending on the concentration you choose. You should message your advisor if you have questions/ doubts and let them know of any courses you took that might be equivalent.

            "comment": "1. You're on this subreddit, thats already a good start. When the semester ends, its common to see a few posts of people selling their books here.\n\n2. Check eBay, offerup, and amazon for used copies.\n\n3. If your professor requires the 10th edition of some book, for example, ask/check if some older editions are ok and still relevant.\n\n4. Many books can be found as pdfs online, just put in the name of the book + pdf into google and see what you can find. This exists as well: /r/textbookrequests\n\n5. Lastly, sometimes the textbooks are optional. Dont feel like you have to buy every single book every semester, lots of information online these days.\n\nOf course, in the event you need some access code to do online homework, you might actually have to buy that. It sucks but thats how it is sometimes. Math classes tend to be that way.",

            "comment": "If you want to do things legally and not pirate the books these are my tips:\n\n1. obviously check for ebay, amazon, and the other second hand resources other have mentioned here first\n2. ask if the textbook is STRICTLY necessary (i.e. if they ask you to read from page x to page y and then reflect on it, then you're gonna need it)\n3. ask the teacher if they have extra copies or are willing to help out in any way, I've had teacher that supply an online version of the book to students\n4. MANY online libraries will allow you to \"borrow\" the textbook for a few days for free. Completely legal. You can just re-borrow it after the time is up and it'll let you as many times as you need.\n5. If you dont NEED the textbook but would still like to learn more about the topic, look up other online resources. For the most part, you can find pretty much anything on any topic for free online if you do your research right\n6. [https://library.fiu.edu/](https://library.fiu.edu/) use the FIU library!\n7. Maybe find a friend you could buy a textbook with. Whenever I've bought a textbook, I NEVER use it everyday, so you can buy one with a friend you trust and then share it/take turns having it. Instant 50% off.\n8. There are resources like [https://www.bartleby.com/](https://www.bartleby.com/)  that let you access many textbooks for a monthly subscription fee. This might be a cheaper option, but you gotta do your research and your calculations, making sure that the ones you need are on there, are included AND the total money youll be spending will be cheaper than if you bought them.\n9. Consider that if you buy them, you'll probably be able to sell them once the semester is over. It might be cheaper to buy a $100 textbook and then resell it once the semester is over for a bit less (lets say $80). So, in the long run the textbook will only have cost you $20 for the semester. \n10. Visit your local libraries. Many times people will just donate them to libraries once they have no more use for it. You might find the ones you're looking for or at least similar ones. Check with your professor if they work for you.\n11. Dont forget about the panther book pack! Many times its more expensive and, personally, Ive had problems with it (one of my books never shipped and I never got it), BUT its not a good idea to instantly discard it. Consider it, do your calculations, and figure out of it is cheaper to pay for it than to buy them yourself. Consider also that by paying for the panther book pack, youre also paying for the commodity of not having to waste time researching and looking for the right books, as they'll be instantly shipped to your doorstep. \n\nHope this helps!",

Yeah they\u2019re old but you got the basics, parking lot literally right there, full kitchen, bed, shower, couch, desk. Nobody\u2019s monitoring you, and you can bring people in and out whenever wherever. Plus there\u2019s a basketball court nearby, and if the washer/dryer is full you can just go to the next building to use theirs. It\u2019s no-frills but honestly a lot less issues than living in the newer buildings.",

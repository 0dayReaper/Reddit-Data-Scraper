Would this be a good idea, or would it be better to simply wait until January?\n\nIf I do end up waiting until the start of the Spring term, would it still be possible to graduate at the same time as people who started in Fall by taking more classes? \n\nMy chosen major is Biological Sciences if it matters.",

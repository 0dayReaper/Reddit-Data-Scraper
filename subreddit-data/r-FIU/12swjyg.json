I reached out to transfer services about this but they\u2019re insisting I have an AS, which I don\u2019t. \n\nI got my AA from State College of Florida in Dec. 2022. All my paperwork from there, like my unofficial transcript, official transcript, and my degree say Associate of Arts. I\u2019ve reordered hard copies of the official records to be sent to FIU just to cover my bases since they\u2019re not being super helpful in figuring this out.\n\nHas anybody else had this happen??? Am I just screwed and just have to retake a course for credit I\u2019ve already paid for/earned?",

            "comment": "I can see why that can be frustrating. I would order your official transcript to be sent to you so you can download it and attach it in an email. The official transcript should note what degree you graduated with which you could probably circle \u2b55\ufe0f to make it easier for them. Then I would send the email to multiple people which could include your advisor, the general advising department of your program, and could even include your program director.",

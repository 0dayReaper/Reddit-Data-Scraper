    "postText": "I am trying to take a chemistry 2 lab online. When I contacted the chemistry enrollment department, I was told that it was only for online students. However, the class is barely half full &amp; the enrollment deadline is near, so I don\u2019t see why they can\u2019t open it to everyone. Is there any way I can convince them to open a space? The only way I can take this class is online so it\u2019s very important.",

I\u2019ve heard from other students that if there are seats open on the first week of class then the online class will open to all students online and on campus. You may just have to send your advisor a message to allow access for enrollment.",

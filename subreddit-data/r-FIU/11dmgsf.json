    "postText": "Hi! I recently moved out of Florida while attending FIU. I'm currently online. Last semester, I applied for a dependency override because my parents made too much money, and I wanted to leave that abusive household. Dorms were completely booked, and apartments cost way too much. I could not afford to live there myself. I want to reapply for a dependency override for 23-24, but my tax return states my current address, which is out of state. I've been reading through the BF handbook and FIU's website, but I'm not entirely sure what can be done. \n\nI just want to know if there's anyone else who took FIU online out of state while maintaining in-state tuition.\n\nThank you",

Basically, you have to fill out a form, do your FAFSA, write a letter about your situation, and provide W2 and 2022 tax returns. If you don't have tax returns then provide pay stubs. You'll see it all. Good luck!",

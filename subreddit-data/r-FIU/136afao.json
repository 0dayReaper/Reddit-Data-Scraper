    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI recently finished my AA in Biology and I'm looking to transfer to finish my Bachelor's. I'm very interested in both FIU and UM and have been accepted in both. \n\nFIU specifically has a Forensic Biomolecular Biology track that heavily relates to my career goals so I wanted to ask if you are in this track or know someone who is that could tell me whether it is worth it or not (I want to pursue a career in forensic DNA analysis). Mainly if it's worth it over UM's normal Biology degree. \n\nCost wise, UM is definitely expensive but if it's worth it academically speaking then well I could figure it out, while in FIU I could potentially graduate debt free.\n\nThank you!",

I have attached some links that you can take a look into the requirements and the program - we also have a certificate in forensic science if you want to look into that - https://ifri.fiu.edu/academics/undergraduate-certificate-in-forensic-science/ \n\nhttps://case.fiu.edu/advising/_files/biology-bs-forensic-biomolecular-at-a-glance-fall-20201.pdf\n\nhttps://case.fiu.edu/biology/bs-in-biological-sciences/_assets/forensic-track-program-of-study.pdf\n\nThe course options may be a little outdated but like 90 percent of the stuff is usually the same. :)",

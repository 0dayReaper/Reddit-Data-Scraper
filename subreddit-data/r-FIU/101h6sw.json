    "postText": "Like the title says, I graduated in 07 with a BA in Business Management. I also have a MS in Information Security. \n\nAt my current job I've fallen into a software developer role for the past 3 or so years. Now I would like to couple this job with an actual degree in CS, as well as use my GI Bill \n\nThe online CS degree is appealing to me. I'm looking at the Application checklist and I can't figure out which one actually applies to me.\n\nI don't think I'm a transfer student.... I'm a graduate but I don't want to pursue another Masters. I am returning but not to finish a degree I started.\n\nHas anyone else gone through a similar situation?",

However, for the past 3 years, i have been working as a software developer. \n\nI am planning to start my computer engineering or computer science bachelors this coming fall.\n\nI have an appointment to speak to an advisor next week. Hopefully that will help me decide which bachelors to take.\n\nGood luck!",

However, in general, it's safe to say that a lot of things can happen between starting a degree and finishing it.  Quite a few students end up finishing in some other semester than the one they'd planned on.  Internships, courses not being offered when needed, having to repeat a course, financial difficulties....all these things and others can affect a planned graduation date.\n\nI say, if you're ready to get started, then get started!  There's no time like the present.",

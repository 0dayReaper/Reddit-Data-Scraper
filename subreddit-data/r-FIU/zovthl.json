    "postText": "Been trying to get my security deposit back from 4th Street Commons ever since moving out in July. It's been a pain trying to get answers or even talking to someone. (Took 2 months for them to respond to my first email)\n\n They told me there are other people in my situation so was wondering if anyone else on here is going through the same thing, maybe we can team up lol.",

Emails and verbal threats of involving my lawyer are apparently not working.\n\nFor context, I had a minor charge after move out (like a paint chip thing) but to make the refund process easier (according to them) I just settled it and they said they'd remove the amount from my refund check. Even with this extra step tho they're still super late in refunding my deposit which is worth two months of rent so, not fun.",

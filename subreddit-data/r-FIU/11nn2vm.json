    "postText": "I am going to apply in Fall this year for the scholarship but the problem is I have a very low GPA (3.0 UW) also I don't have a weighed GPA because my school doesn't follow the US curriculum but I have 1600 on the SAT and a 36 on the ACT fortunately. I do plan on submitting both the scores. Do you think I can get the scholarship or my GPA is going to bring me down ?\nThanks !",

Make sure you apply to the ambassador scholarship too just in case. I've yet to meet anyone above a 1500 who got it (I know over 15 who didn't 1500+) and everyone I've met with 1400s got it, so I think there's a yield protect line at 1500.\n\nGood luck! Let me know if my hypothesis stands true for you \ud83e\udd23",

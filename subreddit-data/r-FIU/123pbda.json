I was wondering if anyone on here could tell me about their experience at FIU and if anyone is in the psych program please tell me about your experience with the program.",

            "comment": "FIU academically is fantastic. However, it is a commuter school primarily, and I've found it a little difficult to get that social aspect of university satisfied. People are on the move, and people usually leave for home or work the moment class is done.  \n\n\nThere are events every now and again though! So keep an eye out for those if you do enroll here. Overall, I've been happy with FIU and I don't think I regret doing my degree here, beyond minor grievances that you'll find with any university.   \n\n\nOh, and I highly recommend finding a place close to campus, Miami traffic is hellish sometimes.",

If you\u2019re looking for a traditional party school then i suggest maybe look else where (even though you can certainly find that on campus in greek life) but even though it is a commuter school, the more involved you get on campus within clubs and organizations, the more you find other people who are also just as involved and it feels like that traditional experience. The nice thing about FIU is that there\u2019s TONS of untapped resources that you\u2019ll know about once you get involved. Good luck! I loved my experience at FIU\n\nEdit: I am also in the psych program about to graduate, i HIGHLY suggest getting involved in research and asking your professors about research opportunities. Makes a big difference and there\u2019s tons of opportunities available !",

            "comment": "It's an amazing school. It's affordable even with zero financial aid. Academics are top-tier (refer to RMP) , and the campus is large and lively, which is all that matters to me. \n\nIf you want the \"college experience\" badly, there are dorms inside and outside of campus. Most people live home so there's less chances of getting into activities, going to parties, though there are always events going on with many clubs, you just have to pursue it. \n\nI personally just drive to college and stay a little after lectures to study or go back home. The gym is L.A. Fitness quality too, which is nice. I'm not a fan of parking but you have to realize just how many people attend this school. From 10:00AM-1:00 PM expect to drive to the highest parking floor, but before and after that you should find parking no problem.\n\nTraffic isn't as bad as I presumed (especially for miami) because I just take the expressway, but expect the school to be packed at noon. \n\nOne of my engineering professors told me that every university offers almost the same bachelor's education, so it really boils down to prestige. I also love the Miami community, so the university really feels like home.",

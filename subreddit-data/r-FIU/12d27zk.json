    "postText": "Hello, \n\nI graduated with an AA in the fall and I'm entering the psych program as a transfer this summer. All the psych program-adjacent courses I need seem to be full and I cant get in touch w/ an advisor. Can I just take some general electives, even if they aren't in my major? I don't want to miss out this semester but everything seems closed.\n\nThanks!!",

Here is the track sheet: https://case.fiu.edu/psychology/ba-in-psychology/ba-in-psychology-program-sheet-fall_2021-final3.pdf  \nIf you are doing psych, you can probably take some level 3000 and 4000 psych courses and Global learning classes, but you won\u2019t be able to enroll until orientation hold is removed.",

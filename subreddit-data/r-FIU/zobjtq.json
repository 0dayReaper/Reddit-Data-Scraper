That's literally a week after I graduate from HS! The letter is also talking about some \"STEP\" transition program, please help me! I am confused and worried about this.",

So pretty much this summer and next summer and after that you\u2019re requirement for summer courses is done if don\u2019t want to do them anymore. But by doing them you get ahead also which is good.",

In most cases, they'll have you start from College Algebra or Pre-Calculus so that you can be ready to take Calc 1, 2, and/or 3.\n\nIn my case, I started in Summer 2021 (immediately after I graduated \ud83e\udd22) and they had me in Early Fall STEP for Computer Engineering but starting off in College Algebra instead of Calculus.\n\nFor more info: https://admissions.fiu.edu/admission-standards/freshman-pathways/\n\nHopefully this helps!",

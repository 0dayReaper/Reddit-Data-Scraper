I applied for a scholarship last April and wasn\u2019t notified of me getting the scholarship before fall semester started. I thought I didn\u2019t get it since I didn\u2019t hear back from them for so long and was so shocked when I was notified. I applied for a fellowship at the end of December and was just notified last week of getting it. Hopefully you get notified fairly quickly but that hasn\u2019t been my experience but good luck",

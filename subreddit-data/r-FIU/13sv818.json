    "postText": "Hi! As of now Im going to have 6 credit hours in total summer terms. Next summer however I plan on going on a tour with a group that I perform with and dont see myself doing summer but I am set to graduate the following fall so that would mean I am missing 3 credit hours for the requirement. Does anyone know if there is a way around this requirement that will allow me to graduate on time? (Also sorry for any grammer errors)",

Graduated from UF and had only 6 summer credits just like you. Start the appeal process, they\u2019ll rubber stamp you as long as you play ball. Talk to an advisor as well",

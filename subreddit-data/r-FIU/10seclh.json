    "postText": "I\u2019m wondering what people think of the neuroscience major at FIU. \n\nWhat were your expectations going into the major and how does it compare to how you know it to be now?\n\nI\u2019m graduating this Spring from PBSC with my AA, and am debating attending FIU or FAU for neuroscience. FIU seems more respected and ranks higher in many aspects including psychology and biology. But I want to get involved in research, and I am wondering how hard it is to get involved in research at FIU. Not only because of the bigger student body but also because people at FIU seem to be more academic than at FAU. As a disabled person money is an issue as well, and I would actually have to pay for housing if I attend FIU be it through applying for scholarships or working part time.\n\nI have a 3.38 gpa and am shooting for a 3.5 by the end of this semester.\n\nI was wondering if there are any other people that are or have been in a similar position.\n\nBtw I got accepted to both and both are my only two options.",

You can also compare the degree requirements and see which is more suitable for your career/interests. https://case.fiu.edu/psychology/bs-in-behavioral-neuroscience/_assets/bachelor-of-science-in-behavioral-neuroscience-handout.pdf https://www.fau.edu/uas/pdf/2021_2022/Neuroscience_2021-22.pdf",

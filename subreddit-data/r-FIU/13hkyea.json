            "comment": "Data Mining (CAP 4770) with Ron Zacharski. Its online, at your own pace, with zero tests. You do have to do a decent amount of work but its not terribly difficult and the labs teach you a lot about machine learning and Python. I **stupidly** neglected the coursework cause of other classes, but I managed to finish all of it aside from optional material in a little over 6 weeks (this was a 16 week course). I ended with either a high B or an A so you\u2019d really have to try to fail this class. His whole curriculum is available on his GitHub too if you want to take a look at it before deciding. This was easily one of my favorite classes. \n\nPrinciples of Programming Languages (COP 4555) with Gregory Murad Reis is also a good elective to take. Its not as easy as some of the electives but its definitely interesting and will teach you functional programming and different concepts relating to programming languages. Overall its an interesting class that teaches some valuable info and if you can get it with professor Murad Reis you\u2019ll have a decent time.",

Trust those who have taken the class already though that you MUST do the homework to pass the class. Unless it comes naturally to you, the ONLY way you will pass the exams are by doing as many different problems as you can before the exams. The class is all about different methods of integration, and there is no cut and dry way to know which you will need when you start the problem. You won\u2019t have time to try every method, let alone even 3 different methods. The homework and practice you do before hand will give you the experience you need to know what you need to solve the problem on the exams. Best of luck!!",

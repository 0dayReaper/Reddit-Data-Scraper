I\u2019ve heard that these 3 classes each on their own are pretty difficult. Am I crazy for taking all 3? For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019d also be working part-time during this semester. Is the workload manageable?",

At first it can be a little overwhelming but it's doable once you get in the rhythm of it, it's also helpful to remind yourself you're done with core classes after that semester to keep yourself motivated(except for OS, assuming you're in the BA). What teachers did you get?",

Hernandez is great and he teaches data structures really well, you probably won't have any trouble with him. Kianoush does have really hard tests and tough assignments but he curves really heavy so you shouldn't be in much danger.",

Like jobs will interview you on Data Structures. So it\u2019s doable in terms of workload imo but I would treat these classes with a little more attention. Better notes. Fresh notebook. Ask questions. CDA is an absolute snooze fest tho. But even Apple will ask what does RAM or the CPU do.",

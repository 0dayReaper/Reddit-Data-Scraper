    "postText": "Hey, so I\u2019m an incoming freshman about to graduate high school with orientation scheduled for mid June. Quick question regarding registering for classes; Will I be good to start in the late summer like I\u2019m supposed to as stated in my account? I\u2019m scared that registration will be closed / classes will be full by the time I get my orientation and holds done and taken off of my page. Will I be okay? Or should I call someone quick? Any advice and answers is greatly appreciated lol. Thanks in advance.",

The only thing is if you\u2019re planning on taking all online courses your options might be limited since they\u2019re first come first served.",

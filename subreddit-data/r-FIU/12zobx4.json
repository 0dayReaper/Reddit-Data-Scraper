    "postText": " I've been accepted to both Florida tech and fiu for computer science. However I'm undecided as to which one to choose since FIU is significantly cheaper but FIT is a smaller and more engineering focussed. Is the CS program at Florida Tech that much better to justify the price?",

I am 8 courses short of my BSEE at Florida Tech, but I had to stop attending when they declared covid over and ended their remote access program.  Unfortunately, family circumstances prevent me from going back to face-to-face classes, so I'm stuck, unable to finish my degree for the foreseeable future.  I recently learned that FIU has an all-online BSEE, so, as much as I loved Florida Tech, I'm considering transferring.  Any advice?  TIA!",

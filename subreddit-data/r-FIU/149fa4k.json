The overwhelming majority of people I know who are in that program regret it. \n\nYou don't get to choose any of your classes, are stuck with crappy UCCs, you pay more for it but aren't eligible for several scholarships regular students can apply for, they say you don't have to take the SAT/ACT but that's just the first year.. I heard they make you take it eventually to \"graduate\" into the regular degree program (this is what I've heard, not 100% certain tbf, but I don't doubt it given that it's a state requirement to have SAT/ACT for public universities). The only pro I see is that they spoon-feed you everything, which some might like if they find starting college life to be too intimidating and that's fine I guess.",

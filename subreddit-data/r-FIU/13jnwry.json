I already understand a little bit from growing up in a Spanish speaking household but I just can't speak it myself.im debating on actually taking classes at fiu or if I should just try different alternatives outside of college classes. I wanted to get someone's opinion on the elementary Spanish class they offer or the regular Spanish classes they offer. Is it worth it? What are th classes like?",

            "comment": "Hi there. I had a similar goal and decided to pursue Spanish through formal classes at FIU. I placed into SPN 2200 and took the various Spanish language courses through SPN 3422. All of the classes I took were online (and there were no in-person options in some of the semesters I took the classes). The effect of the language classes for me was to develop my grammar and ability to produce various kinds of writing in Spanish. My vocabulary is small but I am definitely more confident with my speaking than before I started taking Spanish at FIU. My aural comprehension is terrible and it\u2019s difficult for me to follow and maintain even a basic conversation. The online classes were structured such that there is not much emphasis on hearing spoken Spanish. Instead, most of the work is endless (sometimes 300 questions) WileyPlus assignments online. Ultimately, I\u2019m still glad I took the classes, but my development has been very lopsided and required a lot of extra study. If you decide to go through with it, I highly recommend taking classes in person. \u00a1Que tengas buen suerte!",

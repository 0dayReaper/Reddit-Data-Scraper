            "comment": "I didn\u2019t take that class with milani or Robinson. I took that course with charters. She\u2019s a really nice professor with a decent amount of workload (coding assignments and zybooks). Her quizzes/exams are based on the coding assignments so if you do them and review it before you should be good. Spent most my days in the hardware lab doing her assignments. You can always visit her office hours for any questions or help. I would just go to the hardware lab and get help by the tutors there. I would recommend taking the class with her. I\u2019m taking a course with Michael Robinson right now (CGS 3767) and he\u2019s a very picky grader. He has programming rules and if you don\u2019t follow them he\u2019ll deduct points. Idk how his COP 3804 class is structured so I wouldn\u2019t be able to give you input on how his COP 3804 exams/quizzes or programs are like. If you\u2019re an IT major you\u2019ll probably take one of his classes down the road.",

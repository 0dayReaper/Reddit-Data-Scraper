I am wondering if they were building this in sections, and set this span before the support structure was in place.  The bridge then suffered a shear failure and collapsed under its own weight.",

They were using a new type on concrete as well, typical concrete takes 28 days of curing to reach full strength...it's possible they didn't let it cure enough.

FIGG Bridge Design, like their name suggests, design it and MCM Construction build it but they have engineers and others present for safety measures. FIU didn't hand them a sketch and said \"build it\". Not sure what you are on about.",

What kind of engineering school wouldn't jump on the opportunity to promote themselves with a project like this?\n\nThere's a lot of actual work involved in a project like this, and I just can't see FIU professors getting excited enough about a bridge to take time out of their jobs to work on it.",

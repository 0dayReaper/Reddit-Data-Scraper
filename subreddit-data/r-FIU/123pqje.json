    "postText": "I applied to the Masters in Computer Science program as an in-state resident and filed my financial aid a while ago. I get an \u201cadmissions not confirmed\u201d where it states I have to reapply for a financial aid eligible program? I thought most of the masters were covered or at least allowed for loans but no? Kind of confused. OneStop says it doesn\u2019t affect my admissions decision which is yet to be confirmed.",

That's because there are a lot of international students and the law pretty much locks you into that being the only option to work while on F1. Florida minimum wage is $11 per hour, maybe you'll get a bit more than that but don't expect lot more (unless you're doing your PhD or masters and become a research assistant or teach classes). Immigration law limits you to working 20 hours a week, so you do the math to see it's not really a lot.",

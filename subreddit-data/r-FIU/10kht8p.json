            "comment": "Congrats on becoming an FIU Panther.  Chances are you will be attending an Orientation day @FIU so you will get a tour of the main parts of the campus.  However, when you know your class schedule, you should find the classrooms before your semester begins.  The campus is large and classes can be held at both ends of the campus. You might find yourself walking long distances between classes. If you're able, schedule classes close together in distance but separate in start times so you are not running to class.  If you are driving to school, find the convenient parking spots.  Parking can be hectic and crazy.  FIU has other campuses around Miami Dade County. So make sure you are aware of which campus you are picking you're classes.  Know important dates by using the Academic Calendar on the FIU website.  They will drop you if you don't pay tuition on time.  Also, THERE IS NO POOL ON THE TOP FLOOR.  Know the places to eat on campus.  Good luck and godspeed.",

Also, join clubs that pertain to your major/attend events that can help benefit your uni experience and academic experience. Im fully online yet I feel as if im never missing anything due to FIU\u2019s lively vibe on campus, they offer events online that make me feel welcomed and still a part of FIU.",

    "postText": "Am I the only one who\u2019s had a bad experience? The professor, who is supposedly the head of the department, essentially curves your grade DOWN. The whole semester I thought I had an A, like a 91, 92 percent (even though the grade was locked I was able to calculate it) &amp; then suddenly my final grade in myFIU is a B. She basically said that if your not top 25%, your automatically dropped down to a B, which is just brutal. I mean, I earned an A, &amp; I thought curves were normally supposed to help. I understand TAs grade differently but none of my other labs were done that way.",

She claims it is because TAs grade differently, but classes are also different so just give people what they earn lol. All labs have TA\u2019s &amp; I\u2019ve heard of no other professors that do that. She\u2019s also completely inflexible in everything but is a mess when it comes to putting assignments up or consistency. Many times ide be docked points on the lab reports for very silly things &amp; when I pointed out it\u2019s not in the rubric, she would say \u201cI can\u2019t get to the nitty gritty in the rubric\u201d okay so we\u2019re supposed to guess what you want?",

Which I had a classmate drop the lab because he turned in the wrong assignment and wouldn\u2019t let him amend the mistake so he had 3 missed items. I hope sawmy isn\u2019t in charge of chem 2 labs. However, there\u2019s always a dean for the departments (unless that\u2019s what she is) or someone higher that can be emailed because this class was structured poorly without any consideration for student",

    "postText": "Hi! Hoping to be at FIU by this summer/fall. I have some questions for current students:  \n\n\n1) How's public transport? If you use it, do you feel safe doing so? Can you get to a supermarket, etc? Or is it pretty much necessary to have a vehicle??  \n\n\n2) Do you feel like campus and the area around the 109 and the One are safe, relatively speaking? As in, in the daytime, you don't feel like you have to watch your back or be on high alert.  \n\n\n3) Is the best place to look for 109 or the One sublets here on the subreddit? I keep my eye on the Facebook page for off-campus FIU housing too, but is there any student board for sublets or anything? Links?  \n\n\n4) How much do you spend on groceries per month if you don't mind sharing?   \n\n\nThanks so much for any replies!! :))",

            "comment": "Hey there! I graduated from both schools. I\u2019m not sure what your options are with MDC, but I can tell you that it\u2019s the same core classes, a lot of the professors at MDC work for FIU as well, MDC is cheaper. So let\u2019s say, if you have a full ride and are eligible for fafsa you will receive a refund from fafsa every semester and that\u2019s not a loan, you wouldn\u2019t have to pay it back. Financially it\u2019s a better option especially if you\u2019re just starting and will be taking enc1101 and classes as such. Hope this helps! Feel free to ask me any questions \u2764\ufe0f",

I suggest that if money is an issue. Go to MDC. Honor college is great. A lot of those students have gone off to Ivy League school. There are also transfer scholarships.",

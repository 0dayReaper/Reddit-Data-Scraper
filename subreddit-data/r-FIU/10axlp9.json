International Business is Top 10 program in the world, tourism/hospitality ranked very high as well worldwide. Computer Science has good rankings.\n\nWe just don\u2019t have a \u201cnational\u201d reputation because we don\u2019t have a good football/basketball team. FIU is still the fifth largest university in the country, once we figure out athletics we will be up there, everything else is in place. Even our campus is crazy beautiful. \n\nPaws Up!",

You think University of Alabama, South Carolina and Texas Tech are known because of their top of the line academics? They have big time sports programs and because of that people elevate them to higher than they are.\n\nA lot of the big schools are on the same level as FIU (basically just fine) but they have reputations due to being on tv weekly.",

In very general terms, I'd say FIU doesn't have much of a reputation at all- especially outside Miami, I often have to tell people where the school is, if they've heard about it at all.\n\nIn terms of specific majors and programs, however, there are a number of them that are well-known and respected in the relevant fields. It would probably be more useful for you to look into what you expect to be studying, and see what you find in terms of FIU's reputation there.",

That being said, we\u2019re both excellent, we\u2019re both in the highest class in academia.\n\nAthletics have a lot to do with name recognition.",

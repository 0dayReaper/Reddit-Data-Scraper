I\u2019m from Miami, I live abroad right now but I\u2019d really love to fly in for the graduation dinner that was mentioned in the program overview. I believe a few other masters also have a cohort dinner. \n\nMy question is in ya\u2019lls experience do we know the date well in advance (few months) or usually not?\n\nThanks!",

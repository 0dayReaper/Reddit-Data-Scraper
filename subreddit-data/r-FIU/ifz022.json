They aren't actually expecting students will be honest or use the app diligently but it looks better in court and public relations that the university tried to take precautions to lessen the spread and follow CDC and state gov guidelines as much as possible. Furthermore, lying on the app is not liable to FIU since ***you specifically agree*** that you didn't lie in the checklist.\n\nThings like the FIU P3 app, mandating face coverings and pandetiquette are the compromise between total, draconian lockdown of unessential campus activities and total reopening.",

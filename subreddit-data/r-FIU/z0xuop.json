    "postText": "So I'm a freshman starting in Spring 2023. \n\nhttps://onestop.fiu.edu/classes/register-for-classes/\n\nIt says registration for freshmen begins on the 29th with (continuing students only) in brackets? Anyone knows what they mean by that? Do we really have to wait until the 29th? \n\nAnd for future reference, if you're registering for courses required for your major do you get to start registering on the University Priority registration date(November 1 for Spring 2023)? For instance, I'm a CS major so would I get to register for CS courses early? Or is that date only for specific kinds of students like veterans?",

On the 28/29th, though, new classes will open for that batch of students. Be ready the second you can enroll to try to snatch them.",

Before you make statements, try to think about what you will say and about understanding data. Also, if you look into statistics, you will understand that percentages are just that. In order to determined if there is a significant difference, you would have to perform a scientific study and perform some statistical  test. Even if this would be correct, which I\u2019m assuming it is for the sake of discussion, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that it doesn\u2019t make you a better law school or better lawyer because the bar exam percentage is higher than other Florida universities.  I know is hard to see, but this whole argument is based on your statement is that FIU is the best law school and that is misleading. Are you an FIU law student ? If you are, I would expect a lot more from you, as I know great people that graduated from FIU law school.",

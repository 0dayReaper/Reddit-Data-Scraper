Depending on where you room is you might have to walk down a long ass hall wall to get to the trash room. One of the front doors to the building is currently broken but the others work fine. You will need a new ID which will be given to you for free in order to get into everywhere in the building. There are no regular keys just your ID card to get everywhere in the building.",

            "comment": "Pretty decent experience living there, just wished the rooms were bigger. The view outside is also great. Parking can be a pain since you can only park in either Lot 4 or Lot 7 but its maybe a good 3-5 minutes walk so ig not too bad. You could also park in the lot next to the stadium but you have to be super lucky to find an empty spot. I almost never had a problem living there however, be prepared to wake up in the middle of the night from the fire alarms going off. Happens at least once a month from someone triggering the alarms. Be also prepared for keycard reader malfunctions, I think they fixed the system but it still happens once in a while where everyone gets locked of their dorms cause of it. I think the most problems i had living there were around early fall semester tbh.",

    "postText": "I'm confused as to when my Orientation is. I received an email saying I needed to attend an event the 31st for Honors College Orientation, but I haven't seen any actual option in my FIU Portal to sign up for May 31st Orientation. I don't know if I should show up tomorrow or if maybe I missed some sign-up date and I'd be wasting my time showing up. The FIU website info doesn't help, anyone know what to do?",

            "comment": "So you would have to go to virtual orientation and complete once you have and have gotten accepted to the honors college you would accept it there. However, if you already previously signed up for an orientation (the normal orientation not for honors) then you would need to email the orientation and advising office at FIU. However I believe it is too late to sign up even at the time you posted this. Don\u2019t worry though all the information you need for honors will be given at a zoom call you have to sign up for, look at your FIU email or normal email. It should give you specific instructions and a link to sign up for the zoom.",

The manager, back when it was Aramark he was the head manager at Chili's. really doesn't give a fuck about health codes or anything like making sure the meat is cooked or anything. Aramark's standards are way lower than Chartwell's also. \n\nSo yeah they failed nasty lol so they were given a day to get their shit together. Workers had to come in early as fuck supposedly so they could work on that apparent shit show. \n\nAnywho after the next inspection things should be back to normal. Hopefully. ",

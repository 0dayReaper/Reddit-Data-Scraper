His exams are open notes and he curves very favorably",

He definitely goes over things quickly but is super helpful. The class has 5 programming assignments, a take home midterm, a midterm, and a bunch of class activities that you get full credit for just by attending class. \nI took Computer Architecture with him last semester, this class didn\u2019t have class activities but it has a lot of homework, a midterm and a final. The final was certainly difficult but he curves the heck out of it. Must stay engaged because it\u2019s just a lot of numbers in the beginning then he goes into RAM and CPU how things are stored. There aren\u2019t many resources online so the book is a lot of help. Hope that helps lol good luck!",

Lectures are boring, but he will help clarify anything and is in general a good guy. You will definitely learn stuff about c, threads, etc. The assignments are moderately difficult and time consuming, exams were pretty difficult and class average 40ish%. He curves pretty heavily though and I came out with an A. Overall I would take him if you can.",

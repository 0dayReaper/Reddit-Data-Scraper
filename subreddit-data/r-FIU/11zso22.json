I wanted to share something that could make a difference for those of us at FIU living with epilepsy.\n\nWe've created a warm and understanding Reddit group: r/FIUEpilepsySupport \n\nOur goal is to create a space where we can:\n\nConnect with fellow students who truly understand\n\nShare our personal experiences and learn from each other\n\nAsk questions and seek advice in a supportive environment\n\nDiscover valuable campus resources and tips for managing life with epilepsy\n\nWe believe that together, we can navigate the challenges of epilepsy and thrive as a tight-knit community at FIU.",

But I\u2019m not sure there is a big market for disabled students specifically with epilepsy, and so I want to ask if you could make a group that caters to a larger audience such as all disabled students.",

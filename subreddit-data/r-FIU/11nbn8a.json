However, 0/10 would not recommend taking it over the summer as it is a condensed semester compared to spring and fall, so you'll be learning all these concepts on a much, much quicker pace. If you still want to give it a go, try to not overload your schedule with other difficult courses. Study with groups too, that'll help TONS.",

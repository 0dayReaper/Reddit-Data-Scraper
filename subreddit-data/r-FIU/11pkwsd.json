    "postText": "Hello Panthers! I\u2019m interested in setting up a billiard/pool club at FIU. I\u2019ve had about 2 years of consistent experience with the game, and am ranked a 3 in APA 9-ball. Since the reopening of the game room at MMC, I\u2019ve seen the growth for the love of pool firsthand, and would love to create a club for like-minded players to learn and maybe compete against each other or other schools. Would anyone here be interested? If so, please leave a comment or a DM!",

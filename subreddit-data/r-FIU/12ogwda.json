I was/am confused so I called one stop and I was told that I could register for my classes after orientation, so I should just wait until then\u2026but when I look online, it says that the enrollment date is when we should be selecting our courses. How do I know what classes I should be taking before I go to orientation and meet with my advisor? I\u2019m also very unfamiliar with the whole process of selecting the right courses, I don\u2019t want to select ones that I don\u2019t need. Can anyone help clarify this for me?",

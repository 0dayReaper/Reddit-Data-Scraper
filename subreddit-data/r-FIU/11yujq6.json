If you wanna apply for falls then they'll be higher. You can do community College since not only is it cheaper but then you can transfer, but have in mind sometimes for some degrees fiu gets a bit picky about the classes and you might have to take them again bc they won't accept them. Though that doesn't happen as often, just depends on the degree, and if it does it'll be like 1 or 2 classes they won't accept (if it happens). On the plus side the SAT/ACT and highschool stuff won't matter as much to fiu if you transfer. If anything you could also call admissions for questions! (But you might have to spam them)\n\nBest of luck!",

I graduated undergrad Cum Laude, and now I\u2019m in law school.\n\nYou can try applying for the summer semester if you\u2019re worried about the competitiveness of your GPA. They, atleast when I applied, used the summer semesters for \u201ctesting\u201d whether you had what it takes. And don\u2019t worry, once you get into college your high school gpa means literally nothing, I\u2019m the perfect example lol.\n\nMDC to FIU is also super common and frankly the smarter decision if you\u2019re not financially well off and don\u2019t get a scholarship or financial aid. Tons of my friends did that and it makes sense since years 1-2 are just the UCC which is ubiquitous for all state colleges.",

Let me break some facts down for you. \n\nThis university, in terms of its administration function, is lacking tremendously. Students, more often than not, are left flapping in the wind to seeking any kind of personal actions in almost every facet of the admin department. The school embodies a counterproductive mentality where, instead of servicing the students, it elects to do what's more comfortable for them. Mainly because of the lack of accountability for their scopes of work pertaining to the employees there.\n\nMy personal experience alone can attest to this. I've seen community colleges run more effectively and support their students accordingly.  \n\nIn terms of the quality of education. Considering tuition is roughly 6-8k a semester, a reasonable person would expect professors to break down complex concepts in a way that most students can understand the material. The fact is that most classes are self-taught and student driven. So essentially, what you're paying for is just the regional accreditation and the FIU stamp.\n\nIn terms of accountability, this school tends to protect their professors from any meaningful corrective action. For example, I had a professor break a class room up into A and B teams. These teams were given a different set of assignments. However, team A had a tremendously reduced workload compared to team b. This is clearly preferential treatment in terms of grading. \n\nLet me ask you this. On all that \"mandatory training,\" did you ever get informed about whistle-blower reprisal, which is codified by law? Or the department of education inspector general hot-line complaint? Or any form of redress when a professor is in violation of law, policy, or regulation? \n\nThe answer to that question is no. And it's obvious why the school conveniently omits this information. Because investigations into faculty will give the school a black eye. So most students suck up and drive on, and unethical behavior gets rarely reported to outside parties. \n\n\nI get your emotional because being accepted to FIU is probably the biggest achievement you have had in your life for now. But a polished turd is still a turd.\n\n\nCheers",

    "postText": "So I\u2019m a transfer student trying to get into marketing BBA but when I tried to apply for it I got rejected because I\u2019m missing accounting ii and macroeconomics. Currently getting my classes paid through financial aid, what would be the best approach to being able to transfer into marketing but still have aid pay for the classes since taking a different major they would not pay for those courses right?",

Good luck!",

    "postText": "Hi, Panthers!  \n\nI'm currently a student in a BS Electrical Engineering program at another college, which shall be nameless here but let's call it Dream School, because that's what it was for me.  I have a respectable (although admittedly not stellar) GPA, and I'm only 8 courses away from completing my degree.  Unfortunately, Dream School has declared the covid pandemic over and discontinued their remote access program, which means all classes have gone back to face-to-face (FTF) only.  \n\nThis may be fine for my 20-something classmates, but I am a returning student working on a second BS in a new field.  That is, I'm no longer 20-something, and with age comes increased covid risk (along with a crappy Obamacare health insurance policy that means a trip to the hospital would send me straight to bankruptcy court when I got out).  Also, I have elderly family members, and the one thing I \\*cannot\\* do is catch covid and take it, perhaps unknowingly, to them.  So, in the current circumstance, FTF coursework is not an option for me.\n\nDream School says remote access is not coming back, so I have to decide between transferring to a school that offers an online option in this major and finishing somewhere other than Dream School (an idea I do not like), or not finishing my degree at all (an idea I hate!).  No insult intended toward FIU:  I just really, really love (perhaps I should say \"loved\") Dream School, and it hurts my heart that I'm not going to be able to finish there.\n\nAnyway, even though I'm still kind of mourning the end of my prospects for a Dream School degree, I do have to look to the future.  FIU has a BSEE program that's all online, and I understand that ABET accreditation is coming.  (This fall?)  What do you guys have to say about FIU in general and this online degree program in particular?  Could it be a good option for me?  And would they accept a three-quarters-done covid refugee from another school?  What questions should I ask any faculty or administrators I might talk to during the application process?\n\nPerhaps colleges are like boyfriends/girlfriends, and I should get over this breakup with Dream School and learn to love again?  :-)\n\nAll advice and inside information gratefully received.  Thanks!",

Started talking and hit it off...\n\n...married almost 12 years now with three little Panthers. \n\nI haven\u2019t been inside GL in a number of years but I believe they remodeled and our computer lab is gone or remodeled. At the top of the stairs/escalators, if you went to the right (east side) of the building the lab was off to the left hand side.",

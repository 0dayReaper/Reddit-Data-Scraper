    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all.. so recently back in january of this year i declared a \u201csecond major\u201d to not go over my excess credit hour\u2019s surcharge. I switched to pre-pa track hence why I did this. Lets say everything goes right (i pass all my classes left needed)\u2026 since i declared a second major, i won\u2019t go over the excess credit surcharge, right? bc i declared the second major before i went over it and will be graduating with a 145 credits bc of the prereq courses. i tried emailing my advisor but got nothing. anything is appreciated.",

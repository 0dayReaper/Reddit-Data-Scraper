    "postText": "I\u2019m a freshmen student taking classes fully online. I have the classes I need to enroll in but I can\u2019t select them until the 28th. My issue is that when I look at the close catalog for my classes not only do I see only like three classes that are open, none of them are online. \n\nWill more classes become available at my enrollment date? Or am I SOL because so many other people are registering for my classes before I even have a chance?",

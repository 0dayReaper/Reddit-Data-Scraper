    "postText": "So I'm in my second year at MDC and getting close to finish off my credits for my AA and I know the final deadline to apply for the honors program is in May.  I plan to transfer to FIU by Fall 2023 to major in their PRACC program and thought about applying for honors as a last resort to pay off tuition. Although, this is coming from someone who didn't even do the honors program at MDC so idk what it's like over at FIU. Of course, I'm applying to other scholarships as well, but worried about GPA criteria so that's why I'm having second thoughts about it. Part of me wants to not be overwhelmed since I heard that courses are harder and the other part of me doesn't want to go into debt, yet I still want to enjoy university life if possible. I wasn't interested at first since I'm not the most advanced (if that matters), but again I'm not sure what to do so any advice would help, thanks ;-;",

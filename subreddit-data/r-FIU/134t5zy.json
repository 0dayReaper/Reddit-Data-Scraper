Do you have a passion for the field, are you hard-working, optimistic, and up for a challenge? We want to add you to our fun, growing team of superheroes!\n\nAt Evolving Minds Together we use scientifically proven principles of Applied Behavioral Analysis to teach children to communicate effectively, play functionally, socially engage appropriately, and, most importantly, live independently. We use the same principles to reduce maladaptive behaviors such as tantrums, aggression, disobedience, and self-injurious behaviors.\n\nWe also strive to be inclusive and celebrate multiple approaches and points of view. We believe diversity drives innovation. We\u2019re always growing our network of people, programs and tools all designed to help employees grow and advance their career to the next level. We are dedicated to offer a safe environment for our staff to grow and learn.",

I also had a 4.5 weighted GPA and I did get in for early fall , aka summer . Also as I mentioned before I applied maybe two weeks after their application opened so there was of course space . If you have any questions, i recommend speaking to an admissions counselor and they may be able to give you clearer direction. Hope that helps and best of luck :)",

Do you know any ways to add credits or if I do summer classes and apply before those classes end will credits from summer term be considered as credits so that I would have 30 in total? \n\nThanks",

You can transfer with 30 &amp; no SAT as long as you have a 2.0 GPA, and a C or better in college math and college English. But it has to be college level &amp; it has to be completed",

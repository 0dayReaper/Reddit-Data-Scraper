I have messaged a couple of different advisors and called and left voicemails, and I haven't had any communication in return. I feel directionless. I would appreciate any help!",

If that doesn\u2019t work, you can do what I do and wonder why advisors exist at all for online students when we can\u2019t seem to get ahold of them through any reasonable means.\n\nMore seriously, contact these advisors if you can\u2019t reach yours: https://ccj.fiu.edu/advising/index.html",

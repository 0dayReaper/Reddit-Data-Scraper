    "postText": "Hey guys, Imma bout to take classes with Prof Caryl Rahn next term. I did a small research and found out she has extremely bad reputation. Is she that bad? When I was in College I also had professor with bad reviews, and then they were not that big deal. So, Idk if her class is really that hard.  \nStudents who took classes with her, any tip? She is my only option. What can I expect?",

I initialized a variable inside the header of a for loop and apparently that was only introduced in c99. In 1999. So the compiler was from before then.  \n\n\nanyway yeah bad professor but if you just follow the rubrics you'll be fine.    \n\\`\\`",

Wasn't hard to pass her course it was just annoying and some people actually did fail her course because she took off a lot of points from the final report. Overall if you have to take her it's not that bad you just kinda have to do stuff in her specific way with vague instructions",

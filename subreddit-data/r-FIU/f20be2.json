It was a great atmosphere and some people were really good!\n\nThen at some point they instituted \"piano hours\" and locked the piano for most of the day, ruining the whole thing. The piano hours are late in the evening when there's far fewer people around.\n\nThese things always happen because somebody was an asshole and ruined it for everyone. That person can F right off.",

There are other ways to get in which are test optional. If you can show the ability to get good grades in college course work and build up some transfer credits, you'll be a better candidate and that'll matter more than the test scores. You're not talking about a super elite institution, acceptance rate is around 70%, so all you need is to be average or a bit above. Not to mention, you save a lot of money by getting your gen eds out the way at the Community College level.",

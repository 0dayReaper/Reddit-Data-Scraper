    "postText": "Hi everyone, I recently failed a class and I\u2019m disappointed, I\u2019ll give some background on it. So basically I\u2019m a Global First Year student and my advisor registers me for classes. So I couldn\u2019t register myself for them. What happened is that I got registered to a totally different class which was social math and I went to classes for 2 months, all of a sudden they switched me over to pre calc and I really never got to catch up and struggled a lot which ultimately led me to fail. But I\u2019ve heard that they can change the class to N/C and how does that work? \nI also plan on transferring schools and if the n/c doesn\u2019t work and I get a good grade when I retake it, will that affect my chances of transferring since it says that I have previously failed?. I have a really good gpa and I\u2019m a bit worried, I want to go to my dream university and I\u2019m scared that it will affect my chances",

Some advisors are really bad, so if they make a future mistake and you spot it, you can email them to fix it.\n\nTo get to your PDA, go to my.fiu.edu, then to \"Academic Advising,\" then to \"Panther Degree Audit\"",

Im not sure if pre calc falls under the category of UCC though. You can also try grade forgiveness which lets you retake the course you failed within two semesters after failing it and it will replace your failing grade with whatever you get the second time. Keep in mind you can only do this 3 times while attending FIU. Good luck.",

    "postText": "This is for the Accelerated BSN offered at FIU\n\nPre-reqs\nFair share of pre-reqs were taken at FIU: Micro, ethics, nutrition, anatomy. My highest chm was at MDC.\nThe past nursing advisor calculated me at a 3.7 science gpa and 3.7 overall gpa.\n\nTeas\nI attempted once and placed a 76.7 overall and 84.1 science. I did ok on english(84.8) and reading(76.9). I got a low score on math at 58.8. I considered reattempting but the advisor said that my teas was already competitive enough and i should not worry about the math as they only factor overall and science.(I am hoping this is the case because i really do not want to retake, i feel like i may score lower on math because its been 1 month post studying. I would hate to refresh again. I just wanna move on)\n\nHealthcare\nI have 3 years of patient care experience. 2 years in the Emergency Department. From this i SHADOWED like crazy from the connects i made: podiatrists, ED NPs,  ED physicians, CRNAs, and made sure to document every interaction and plan to submit that into nursing cas. I should have just under 200 hrs over the years. I also have 4 seperate letter of rec that i plan to submit(is this too much or should i go for it? All letters are signed, dated, and have my hospitals company letter head stamp along with the providers contacts)\n \nI have no volunteer experience and hopefully that wont factor in my case.\n\nAll of the above are my current stats and Im really hoping I can get an offer. I really tried to hit every spot admission would consider and I plan to submit my application tomorrow  after reviewing one last time.\nOne ABSN graduate nurse from fiu that I actually worked with at an ED told me that I am doing wayyy more than she did in prepping for this cycle, so shes sure I can get an offer but theres always that chance....\n\nOf course if there is any prior ABSN students feel free to share advice. Also I heard admissions utlizes a point system in accepting  students does anyone know more about that?",

            "comment": "Hi, I'm trying for the BSN myself but I had the chance to talk to an ABSN student at a hospital once. They said GPA and TEAs scores are probably the most important, and any experience you have is the cherry on top. I've been told recommendation letters aren't necessary for the BSN application, not sure how it is for the ABSN application. Still, I'd totally include your experience/recommendations, it shows you have experience in a hospital setting and makes you appear well-rounded (in my opinion at least).\n\nThere's an information session on May 9th if you'd like to get to know the program better, here's the page with the sign up link: [https://cnhs.fiu.edu/academics/nursing/undergrad-nursing/programs/ao-bsn/](https://cnhs.fiu.edu/academics/nursing/undergrad-nursing/programs/ao-bsn/)\n\nGood luck!",

    "postText": "For context: I'm a freshman who enrolled in the Fall and Spring semesters.\n\nHey guys, I was under the impression that maintaining my Bright Futures Florida Academic Scholarship only required 12 credits in the Fall semester and 12 credits in the Spring semester (in order to be considered \"full time\"). This is the link where I received my information from:\n\n[https://onestop.fiu.edu/finances/types-of-aid/scholarships/bright-futures/](https://onestop.fiu.edu/finances/types-of-aid/scholarships/bright-futures/)\n\nI was also told this by the Bright Futures customer service.\n\nHowever, I have just been told by my counselor and the FIU Onestop Office that they actually require a total of 30 credit hours in the Spring, Fall, and Summer semesters.\n\nI have a total of 27 credits so far, but instead of just taking 3 credits over the summer, I've been told that I need to take 6 credits during the summer if I want to continue receiving the Florida Academic Scholarship rather than the Florida Merit Scholarship.\n\nIs there a website or informational page that clearly explains these requirements in full? Does anyone have any experience with this? I am extremely disappointed with myself for not finding this out sooner, but I really did try and research this issue and thought I was covered. Thank you\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPDATE:\n\nFor anyone who might be curious, I spoke to the Financial Aid office (the Office of Scholarships does not handle Bright Futures) and spoke with my counselor, and they clarified that there is not a 30 credit requirement for the Bright Futures Florida Academic Scholarship! Thanks to anyone who answered.",

The website says 6 credits at least which is half time enrollment. 12 credits is the minimum full time enrollment. Either way I say call the financial aid office just to make sure you def don't wana miss out on getting this!",

My advisor said that I must take 6 credits this summer to make up for it.

So you\u2019d need 3 more credits. 6 credits is that your financial can come in . If you only take 3 you\u2019d have to pay out of pocket.",

I ended up speaking to FIU's Financial Aid department (apparently the Office of Scholarships doesn't deal with Bright Futures) and was told that only a minimum of 6 credits were required, 12 credits to be full-time. They referred me to these links:\n\n[https://onestop.fiu.edu/finances/types-of-aid/scholarships/bright-futures/](https://onestop.fiu.edu/finances/types-of-aid/scholarships/bright-futures/)\n\n[https://www.floridastudentfinancialaidsg.org/SAPBFMAIN/SAPBFMAIN](https://www.floridastudentfinancialaidsg.org/SAPBFMAIN/SAPBFMAIN)\n\nUpon looking further, I did see that FIU-*specific* scholarships DO recommend 30 credits per year, but none of my research has yielded a 30 credit requirement for Bright Futures:\n\n[https://scholarships.fiu.edu/browse-scholarships/merit-scholarships/policies-renewal/index.html](https://scholarships.fiu.edu/browse-scholarships/merit-scholarships/policies-renewal/index.html)\n\nIf it's alright, can I ask where you got your information regarding a minimum of 30 credits annually for Bright Futures from (if it isn't an assumption)?

The problem with online courses is you have to be motivated to learn the material on your own and utilize your sources to the best of your ability. If you can\u2019t find anything that works for you, I\u2019d say go for the online course. Even though the professor has mixed reviews, they\u2019re typically only worth 1 credit so it won\u2019t have a HUGE impact on your GPA if you don\u2019t do well.",

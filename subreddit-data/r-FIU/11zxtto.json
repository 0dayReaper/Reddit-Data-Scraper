    "postText": "FIU engineering-alum here looking to do a bit of market research on the productivity habits of college students currently enrolled full-time and living on campus. \n\nFull disclosure, I'm building a personal productivity app and I'm trying to better understand the current set of time-management problems that are either (a) unmet or (b) somehow met, but could be made way better. And if the system you use is perfect for your needs, I'd love to learn about that too.\n\nIn any case, if you're open to filling out a [short survey](https://forms.gle/WSnyAnZNcVuoZKfF7) (\\~3 mins) or better yet jumping on a [15min call](https://timing.is/open), I'm happy to extend you a lifetime membership to our premium product (for when we ultimately charge for our app). I know it may not mean much, but as bootstrapped founders working in a conservative venture environment, we can't really afford much else at the moment, sorry.\n\nIn any case, if this interests you at all, I'd love to hear from you. If not, and you read this far, then I appreciate the consideration.\n\nCheers.",

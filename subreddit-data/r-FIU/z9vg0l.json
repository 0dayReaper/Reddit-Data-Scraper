Check the course catalogue to be confirm your classes. I have a lot friends that have taken \u201cuseless\u201d classes  (aka not required for their major)",

I am going to campus tomorrow to speak with someone about it but they told me to wait until classes open to everyone on dec 26 which is also ridiculous.",

At the same time, you will be working on your resume and cover letter( which you should be doing either way), which will help you get an internship during the summer!\n\nThere are a lot of assignments, but usually, they are less than a page.\n\nHe also takes a break during the midterms period allowing you to study for your other classes.\n\nIf his class is still open, I highly recommend him.\n\nYou can ask the professor to be added to his class.",

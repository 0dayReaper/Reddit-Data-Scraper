    "postText": "I am from Miami and got accepted into both FIU and FSU. I am conflicted as to which college to attend. I have 100% Bright Futures but I am not sure if I should move out of my house to live in Tallahassee, or stay at home and live with my parents while studying at FIU. Neither college is paying me to attend the school, so if I move to Tallahassee, I would have to be both studying and working part time in order to pay for an apartment/living. If I stay, I would not have to pay any bills other than personal expenses. I plan on studying Management Information Systems, which FSU has a higher ranking than FIU.",

    "postText": "I am a fully online student, and I've had professors give assignments that are tough, thought-provoking, and time consuming. This semester I have a professor who has been completely disorganized from the start. It got so bad, midsemester a group of my colleagues wanted to collectively turn in some of the inconsistencies within his own rubric and scheduling to the dean. It got to about 5 students who were actually willing to go to that length, but didn't end up happening. It's at the point now where he has practically the entire class at a loss when it comes to his expectations and his communication has been subpar, putting it nicely. I'm a perfectionist at this point. I pour my heart into my class work. This professor has gone out of his way to make this class confusing and practically impossible. For example: recommending meeting with group members for coffee for our collaborative group project. (I'm fully online and live 3 and a half hours away) what course of action is available to me here. I have a 97 in his class due to the work I have done on previous assignments it's just the weight he put on this one assignment could get me down to a D.",

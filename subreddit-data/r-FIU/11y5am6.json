    "postText": "I am going onto my senior year doing CS BA but still need to complete the interdisciplinary course requirement. It says I just need nine additional courses within a minor or certificate. So I already taken  STA 2023(3) and STA 4664(3) , would I just need one more statistics class to fulfill this requirement? Hope someone can clarify better for me.",

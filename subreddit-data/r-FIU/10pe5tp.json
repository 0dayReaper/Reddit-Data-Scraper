    "postText": "Good afternoon everyone!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently found out that FIU Law school is offering Joint Degree Programs and one of them happens to be with Construction Management.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will be transferring into FIU during this Summer Semester.  At FIU I plan on majoring in both Construction Management and Finance.  Finance seems like a great choice since construction is a business that revolves entirely the GC's finances. However Law also seems like a great fit, considering just how common lawsuits are in the construction industry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, both Law and Finance can provide me with amazing connections outside of solely the construction industry and could be incredibly beneficial if I choose to create my own construction company one day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo for current students of the three previously mentioned majors, and for alumni who are already working in one or more these three industries, which Double Major do you think would pair best with Construction Management? Law or Finance?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis question also applies for my Civil Engineers and Architects!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. I capitalized certain words on purpose to make them stand out more for those who decide to just skim the text so that they may gain a basic understanding of my questions.",

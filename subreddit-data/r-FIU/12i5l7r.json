    "postText": "I was wondering on whether or not I should join honors as an incoming freshman my main concerns are how many classes I will be taking since supposedly for honors I have to take extra classes. Also If the classes I have to take for honors count towards finishing the pre requirements. (In essence How many classes would i be taking per semester if I'm planning to take 5 how much would honors add on to it and if those classes count towards something)",

I dont how much for freshmans, but I joined as a junior and I had to take 4 Honors courses, and no, they dont count towards towards your pre requirements, they only serve for the Honors program. You are also required to do 20 community hours and service points to graduate from the honors college.",

            "comment": "Your freshman seminar substitutes core requirements so they are not extras classes. The Honors SLS counts for FIU SLS. 3000 classes serve as electives or electives in the major and satisfy Global Learning requirements. 4000 classes are Study Abroad or undergrad research. If you come in fresh it is 19 credits total. If you come in after sophomore year it is 12 credits over four semesters including summer a and b -  which could be classes, study abroad, or research. Engineering majors have it easier with Honors credits.",

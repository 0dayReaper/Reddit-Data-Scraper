The typical summer semester is 11 weeks.  Students often think that professors will abbreviate courses offered in the summer, but most of them don't, and they really shouldn't, since you're getting the same credit as if you'd taken the course in a full term.  So, assuming the course is the same as in fall/spring and you're taking it in the summer, you need to multiply by 16 and then divide by 11 to get a sense of the relative time commitment it will require.  \n\nFor example, let's say you plan to take Course X in summer, and you know from taking similar courses in the past that you could expect to need to spend about 10 hours a week on that course outside of class if you took it in fall or spring.  So...\n\n10 hours per week  x  (16/11)  = 14.5 hours a week\n\nOn the other hand, if you were taking Course X in one of those 6-week summer terms that some schools have, it would work out like this:\n\n10 hours per week x (16/6) = 26.7 hours a week\n\nDon't forget to include the time you'll spend sitting in classes when you do your calculations, too!  That would be on top of these figures.\n\nI'm not familiar with the courses you list, so I have no idea what a reasonable number of hours per week for fall/spring terms would be.  Have you taken junior-level courses in your major before, or is this the first time?  Lower-division (freshman/sophomore) courses tend to take less time than upper-division ones, so if this is the first time you've taken courses at this level, I'd suggest being conservative when you decide how much you can do.  Taking on too much is one of the most common mistakes college students make, and it's easy to mess up your GPA that way.\n\nSomething else you can do is talk to one or more of the professors involved.  Most will be happy to give you an opinion, and they're the ones who know their courses the best.\n\nBest wishes for an awesome and productive summer!",

Last fall I was not happy with the curriculum of the school I was in so I transferred to a different school and had to take a gap semester since my prior school didn't finish the transcripts when I needed them . \n\nSo my plan was to take a couple classes during the summer but I wasn't sure how many is too many for me personally. I finished the 3000 level classes with two As and one B (one was a lower division language class). \n\nI will definitely take that advice about contacting the professors on their input",

    "postText": "Hello! so sorry if this is a stupid question.\n\n I applied for the Digital Arts BFA Animation track, submitted my portfolio, etc for the Fall Semester. Today I logged into panther mail and surprise, i got accepted! Yay! But it says my major is Exploratory Humanities ? \n\nIs this a mistake ? Or is the program I wanted full and they just accept you into other tracks ? Help ? \n\nI really do not want to do nor pay for an exploratory degree when I am 100% sure of the major i'd chosen. I even checked my common app to see if I accidentally picked the wrong major, but no. Any guidance would be appreciated !",

            "comment": "What does your admission letter say? It might be that you didn\u2019t meet admission criteria for your first choice major or applied after the deadline for Fall 2023 (feb 15 per the website) so you were placed in Exploratory. You could submit an application update to change your major to a back- up option (if you have one). AFAIK, the BA in Arts is not limited access and falls under CARTA (same college as the BFA) so it could be a good alternative? \nYou can also contact them at https://carta.fiu.edu/arts/degree-programs-and-deadlines/undergraduate/bachelor-of-fine-arts-in-digital-art/bfa-graphic-design-track/",

Wait for your letter for the next steps\u201d, and when i log into myFIU to accept and submit a deposit my major appears as Experimental Humanities w a Fine Arts track. \nBefore this week it appeared as Digital Arts BFA w the Animation Track, so it\u2019s not as if its been wrong the whole time \n\nI applied by the deadline, I know because the portfolio GetAcceptd that we had to submit locks up at the exact hour of the deadline (it has happened to me in other occasions, haha). I dont know what to do, I will call to ask :( Again thank you for taking time to respond",

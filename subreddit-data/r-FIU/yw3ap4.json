    "postText": "Hi there Panthers! My name is Alyssa and I\u2019m a reporter for the Miami Herald. We\u2019re conducting reporting and working to better understand residents\u2019 experiences with trees, shade and heat throughout the county. According to a[ study](https://www.miamidade.gov/parks/library/urban-tree-canopy-assessment-2021.pdf) conducted by the county in 2021, various communities throughout Miami-Dade have very few trees.\n\nWe\u2019ve created a submission form for people to share any experiences or questions they may have about living in a community with low tree coverage. If you live in Miami-Dade or formerly lived there, and are interested/comfortable with getting in touch with a reporter, please fill out our form. The form is available in English ([www.miamiherald.com/miamitrees](http://www.miamiherald.com/miamitrees)) and Spanish ([www.elnuevoherald.com/arbolesmiami](http://www.elnuevoherald.com/arbolesmiami)). We\u2019ve also created a resource guide, in [Spanish](https://www.elnuevoherald.com/noticias/politica/article268607842.html) and [English](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article268591122.html)[ ](https://www.elnuevoherald.com/noticias/politica/article268607842.html), on how to get free trees from the county. You can further help by sharing this information and our form with friends and family, thanks!",

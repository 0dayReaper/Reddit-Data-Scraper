TBH, you should be searching syllabus', RMP, and asking friends/reddit to see if prof's require the most updated version of the book, or if they use it at all. We are required in some cases to post the newest (most expensive book) on the syllabus by the state/admin, but some of us have work arounds to help you all out.",

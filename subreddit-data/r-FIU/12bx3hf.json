    "postText": "Has anyone ever had any beginning drawing classes (regular or figure drawing) with professor Gretchen Scharnagl? I know she mainly teaches architecture, but as of this Spring semester, I ended up having her for Beginning Figure Drawing instead of Helen Burgos, as the art department switched my professors at the last minute before the semester started.",

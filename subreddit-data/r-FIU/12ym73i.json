    "postText": "Hello-  It sounds like FIU has 55-60k in students, but about 3000 live on campus.  Do the students feel like they are part of a community or is it like a corporate area that clears out when the commuters go home - a ghosttown.  Seeking honest feedback as we're deciding on a college by end of week.  thanks!\n\nAlso any experience in the honors college - good, bad?\n\nHow about the marine science program? How often do you have to go down to Biscayne Bay campus?  \n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Can't speak to most of this but campus community is probably less than a lot of schools where the majority of people *don't* commute, but it's actually not that bad overall (speaking for MMC at least, BBC/other satellite campuses might be a different story). If you're an incoming undergrad and you get involved in some extra curriculars I'm sure you'll be able to keep yourself busy, it always seems like there's a lit of groups promoting themselves outside of GC.",

            "comment": "FIU is definitely a commuter school, in the sense that most students don't live on campus. However, it's still a university- people spend tons of time on campus, even if (or maybe especially if!) they still live at home with their parents. I lived in student housing my entire time at FIU, and the only time it ever felt empty was during breaks between semesters.\n\nI can also vouch for the Honors College- right away it lets you replace some early classes with more interesting ones, and you get to choose from more options as you go along. It should also give you some exclusive options for on-campus housing, which is a big plus if you were planning on doing that.\n\nAs for marine science, that does sound like a program that would have you at BBC quite a bit, but I'd confirm that with a school advisor.",

I stay at the BBC campus and before I joined organization I felt there was a strong sense of community within their housing on campus . Even without housing people are so friendly in the halls you can easily spike up a conversation and make friendships spontaneously unlike MMC. MMC students I feel are heavily on their grind 100% of the time whereas BBC students are pretty laid back. Which is interesting because the Marine science program is one to stress people out sometimes but I guess the environment is so chill. I was already content with my university life before joining two other organizations however after I did I definitely connected with people I would nt typically hangout with and made deep connections. I wish I joined organizations faster because it definitely was well worth it.",

    "postText": "i\u2019m currently majoring in computer science with a BA and have seen people say that i won\u2019t be able to go to graduate school with a BA but some are saying i could. i\u2019m not planning on going for a masters in computer science though. i plan on getting a master of science in data science &amp; artificial intelligence. when i go and check the fiu requirements, it only says that students are required to have a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science, computer engineering, information technology, mathematics, or a related discipline. it doesn\u2019t specify what type of a degree, only that i need a bachelors degree. I obviously am going for a BA in CS and i\u2019m already too far in to switch now soooo i just want to make sure this isn\u2019t going to be an issue.",

Graduate schools are looking for that since most comp sci graduate degrees are in machine learning / AI, which tends to be math heavy. You would be fine getting into a general comp sci degree.",

Like someone else stated, just make sure you take calc 1 &amp; maybe 2 at a minimum, the ba doesn\u2019t require a lot of math but depending on where you want to go to grad school/major in it\u2019ll really help you. I knew I wanted to go to grad school when I was still pursuing my bachelors, so that\u2019s when I took extra classes towards the area I wanted to pursue. A lot of universities will conditionally accept you and let you complete the prerequisites you need in order to start the program, but just double check with the program requirements to be sure",

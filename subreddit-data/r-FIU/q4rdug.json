    "postText": "Hello everyone, I\u2019m a grad student at FIU and I just wanted to share everything that I have experienced at the MMC campus since 2016. I feel like this could help a bunch of incoming freshmen or students that are already at FIU\n\n1. Do not let upper classmen fool you. GC does not have a pool on the top floor. Occasionally, Mark Rosenburg hangs up there to give out steam but it\u2019s nothing short of hot and humid up there.\n\n2. Get involved. Before I lived on campus, I used to explore FIU. I would skate everywhere with a few of my friends. I would suggest you do the same (whether you skate, scoot, or even walk) because you never know who you\u2019ll meet. FIU is filled with amazing people that are on the same boat as you. After all, we\u2019re all just trying to get our degrees.\n\n3. The Frat Life. Listen, this will vary from person to person. I had rushed several fraternities since I was a freshmen but none of them felt like I belonged in them. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I always thought that I needed to be in one but once you have your bachelors degree, you realize you might not need to be in one in order to succeed. It\u2019s really up to you.\n\n4. Grad school. I was part of the unfortunate students that graduated during the pandemic so I had no other option than to continue my studies (I majored in Information Technology but now I\u2019m pursuing my MBA). I\u2019m not going to lie to you guys but I believe doing grad school was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made in my life. I only have 9 months of grad school left and I started a year ago! You\u2019re going to shine bright on your resume, I can assure you that.\n\n5. Alcohol on campus. Chili\u2019s and Vicky Bakery. I used to go to Vicky\u2019s a lot since they had happy hour M-F from 4pm-7pm. With this pandemic, I\u2019m not sure how they do it but that\u2019s how it was before the pandemic. I also knew that Chili\u2019s has specials M-F. I think on Wednesday they had $3 coke and rum but I\u2019m not fully sure. Life I said, the pandemic screwed everything up.\n\nIf you guys want more tips and tricks about FIU, please give this post an up vote. I have a ton more info that I\u2019d love to share with y\u2019all.",

                    "comment": "This is the exact position that I was put in when I was a Junior at FIU. I lived about 3 miles away from FIU but I was eager to get my own place. I was given a great opportunity to live at Identity back in 2019 so I obviously took it. The thing is, that was money that I could\u2019ve used to pay off my car in full. I would say this: do it if you don\u2019t have any debt to worry about, if your parents are a pain to live with, and if you have somewhere else where you could live independently. My parents were a pain to live with but I also had debt and wasn\u2019t so sure what I was going to do after I graduated.\n\nAfter my lease was up at Identity, I had nowhere else to go but back to my parents. I got so used to living by myself that I got depressed having to go back. Only lasted 3 months before I decided to drop everything and move to Tallahassee where I had the financial opportunity to live independently again. Once you live independently, you never want to go back.\n\nP.S. The pandemic screwed everything up so you never really know if you\u2019ll always have the financial support that you currently have. Just something to keep in mind",

Fortunately a lot, almost all of my stuff, is paid for by my parents besides my gas and my credit card payments. They're just a huge pain. I know living in an off-campus apartment will be a huge financial burden, so that's why I'm thinking of a dorm, where the payment isn't as big of a hurdle and it's a middle ground between being fully independent and not being fully independent. I'm getting like $1900 a semester from my scholarships though and I'm just hesistant as hell to give that up",

Plus, if you try to live in another dorm, you\u2019d have to deal with RA\u2019s and the University\u2019s policy. Idk about you but I like my privacy and being able to have friends come over without any hassle.",

            "comment": "First, congratulations on being accepted! It's a great program, and a great school. I have a couple pieces of advice that I hope will be helpful:\n\n1. Don't be afraid to try (or fail at) new things:\nin college as a whole, you'll be experiencing all sorts of things for the first time. And in your architecture classes, you'll very often be asked to use a technique or apply a concept that you probably just heard about. Especially if you're like me and not the most... *artistically gifted*, it can quickly get overwhelming. But the whole point is to constantly push you into unfamiliar territory and force you learn by doing. Your professors will always appreciate big swings that show you're trying to engage with the ideas, even if they don't end up working out the way you planned. \n\n2. Learn to manage your time: As fun as architecture studio can be, it's also obviously a lot of work. You usually start with smaller projects, but they'll quickly give way to projects that take the bulk of the semester to complete. And if you're not careful about managing time, studio will soon dominate your schedule like a gas, filling all the available space. This was something it took me quite a while to realize, but your projects aren't going to be meaningfully better because you stayed in the studio working on models until 3 am every day. If you make a habit early on of dedicating time for your projects, but allowing yourself the time and freedom to do **anything but** your studio work, you'll be much better off.\n\n\nGood luck, and welcome to the Panthers!",

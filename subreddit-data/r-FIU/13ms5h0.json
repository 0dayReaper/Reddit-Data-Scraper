My rent range is between $750- $800 . If anyone knows any rooms or places available( had a hard time finding places within that range since Miami is expensive), I would appreciate it . Thank you !",

You\u2019ll have to up your range an extra 4-500 dollars maybe and split with some roommates.\n\nSorry to say but welcome to Miami, nothing here is cheaper",

It will help immensely. Also, the virtual orientation process is a little confusing, get a headstart on that. Don't want to be doing that the week before class starts.\n\nI started the BSEE program online Summer '23. This is a second undergraduate degree for me. I previously earned a BS in Math many years ago, so it took a little extra effort to get all of my pre-reqs handled.",

Not all of the concentrations are available online. Double check that those that interest you are. E.g. power/energy is but not comms",

Though, there are several of the EE concentration where software is meaningfully important. Specifically, the Data System Software concentration overlaps with much of the core curriculum of CS.\n\nThere is a Software Design and Development track within the CS curriculum (see [BS CS SSD track](https://www.cis.fiu.edu/academics/degrees/undergraduate/cs-design-and-development/)). You may be able to pick some courses from there to create an ad hoc concentration within EE (or add to the Data System Software concentration) with approval from your advisor. In particular, CEN 4010 and 4021. Alternatively, your goals may be better suited by majoring in CS, not EE.",

A couple of things I\u2019d recommend would be to take note what classes are available during the summer versus other semesters if you plan to go year round as summer doesn\u2019t offer everything.\n\nAlso, when I looked ahead at the elective course options for the Fall and Spring semesters, I\u2019d say only half were available at all. For example, for foundations I believe it was, the only classes available were advanced math ones. Now, I had pursued the BACS to avoid the advanced math. \n\nAlso, I\u2019d note there is one professor in the CS program that is known for being very unpleasant. I\u2019m not going to put that here but I\u2019m sure you can figure it out with RateMyProfessor. My advisor told me the class most students typically struggle with is Programming II.\n\nIf you want to get into classes, enroll as soon as physically possible. I\u2019d transferred from BC with my AA and never had this problem but I waited for two weeks after open enrollment and all the classes that I was eligible to take based on prerequisites were full so I was out one whole semester because I waited. \n\nThis brings me to my last point of being mindful of your strategy for which classes to take. Nearly everything has a prerequisite and it\u2019s a messed up spider web if you map it out. Idk about you but my advisor would literally not just let me take other classes before the prerequisite so it\u2019s good to be aware of a strategy for time.\n\nI hope this helps, good luck!",

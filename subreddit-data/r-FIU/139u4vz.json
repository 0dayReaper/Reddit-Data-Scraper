    "postText": "I have FIU as one of my options to transfer after community college. If I read correctly on the prerequisites it is stated that for COP-2210 it has to be a java programming class and that is the only acceptable credit for that specific class. Am I wrong or do they accept other programming language courses like c++, python, or c#? For the moment they are not offering any java courses at my community college until the fall so that would delay my transfer. Hoping someone could clear my doubt.\ud83d\ude4f",

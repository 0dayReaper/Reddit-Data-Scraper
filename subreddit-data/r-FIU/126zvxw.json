When I turned in the form someone placed it in the wrong pile, or so I was told, and that paper misplacement led to me being dropped from all my grad classes and my status was changed from Florida resident student to international student. They tried to charge me $15,000, They went into my library research room that I had rented for the semester, took out all The books I had checked out for the semester to write my 70 page thesis. All without telling me until I got a bill. It took them two months to correct the problem. And I was shuffled around from Office to office as I tried to fix their mistake. Fiu administration is a total fucking joke.",

I submitted all components of my application\u2014some were within the actual application and some were emailed to the graduate admissions office. I checked the status of my application and it was changed from \u201cReferred to department for decision\u201d to \u201cCancelled.\u201d After an hour of being on hold, I reached an admissions representative who told me they didn\u2019t know why my application was cancelled and instructed me to speak with staff from the program I applied to but essentially told me my chances of admission after this are grim. I contacted staff from the program I applied to and the graduate assistant told me they sent me my rejection letter two days ago, explaining they couldn\u2019t even consider my application because I did not submit all parts of my application. Turns out graduate admissions never forwarded my email (containing my letter of intent) to the department. Forwarded them the original email and got my application reinstated. If I hadn\u2019t been more proactive, I would\u2019ve had to reapply for Fall of 2024.",

What happens is based on the individuals in the frat. Kick the student out of the frat, the school, or suspend the frat for a 1-4 year period, sure. But we have frat houses sitting on campus empty and it's such a waste. The school needs a more fun collegiate environment.\n\nThey took away tailgating in the field the year I was a freshman, and now people won't be able to tailgate in the parking lot next to the stadium (which they made sure was lame to begin with)",

I went to a self-styled \u2018Top 50\u2019 private school, the kind that desperately wants to be the next UChicago or UPenn. The president was this dry walrus-looking pencil pusher who hadn\u2019t taught or gone to the school. Dude was absent save for every decision he made to try and squeeze every cent he could out of students.\n\nRosenberg came out not just to nearly every football game, but would take time to give the band a speech at the end of every summer\u2019s camp. He\u2019d make appearances at the most random, small club or honor society events. He had an active personal presence on Instagram based around interacting with faculty and students. And most importantly, he was a professor, not some board-room yes man.\n\nI didn\u2019t agree with most everything he did, but he was a real one.\n\nEDIT: Given recent info, the sentiment of this comment is no longer relevant.

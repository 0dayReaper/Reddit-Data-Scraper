    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m an incoming freshman at FIU and had a question regarding humanities group one. I\u2019m in the honors college and majoring in behavioral neuroscience, with hopes of getting into the EAMP program. All this to say, I was wondering which of the six courses was, for a lack of better words, easiest. I have credit for humanities group two with AP courses but I\u2019m not sure what to take for group one. If anyone took these courses, any advice or your thoughts of the course would help! I know I\u2019m thinking about course selection quite early but I want to lay out my courses for the next four years so I can make sure I stay on track and do everything I need to without making my course load too heavy in some years. So even if its not in regard to humanities group one, any course management advice or professor recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Also anyone who wants to be friends or make a study group, lmk! I\u2019ll be living off campus but want to be as involved as on campus students!!",

Also I did the same thing where I tried planning out everything before I went but in the span of four years there will be many changes that have caused me to change my course trajectory (this is pretty general). Have fun",

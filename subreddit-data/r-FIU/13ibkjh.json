When I submitted my housing agreement I had applied for the pride community in lakeview south, at the time I thought it would be nice and wasn\u2019t necessarily thinking about who I would be paired with and stuff. So I just got the email that I was approved for the community, but the issue is I already found a really great roommate group and they didn\u2019t apply for the pride community. I emailed housing saying that while I appreciate being approved, I would much rather stick with my roommate group even if that means I will no longer be in the pride community. I\u2019m waiting on response but I just wanted to see what my odds were in being able to stay with my roommate group and not having to end up being split up from them and end up with people I may not get along with?",

It\u2019s been about a month now since I completed the form and it being accepted yet still do not see a financial aid package or offer. I am a continuing student, has anyone been in this situation before? I had called the Aid office but all they said was that they are waiting on ProVerify to send some kind of link? Not much help especially since I need Aid for Summer term coming up.",

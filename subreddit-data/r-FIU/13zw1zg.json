I wanna know so I can shop. \nAnd what about winter? I know it doesn\u2019t snow there but typically what do you wear in winter? \n\n\nAny other tips would be extremely useful\nThanks",

I\u2019ll never forget the way the air felt when I came back to Miami after going to the desert\u2026 the humidity smacks you in the face as soon as the airport doors open lol\n\nThe winter does get better, but it\u2019s still kinda humid. It\u2019s just not as humid as the summer and to a local it doesn\u2019t really feel humid. But you\u2019ll still get humidity in the 70-80% range on some days. Other days 50-60%. It\u2019s a tropical climate so warm days will be humid, rainy days will be the most humid, and cold/cooler days will be drier.",

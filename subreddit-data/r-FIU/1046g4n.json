Will I not be dropped if I email the lab TA the first week? Or will labs not meet for the second week either since we have Monday off from MLK jr. day?",

For MMC, there's a chance they may have not assigned TAs yet, or those TAs may not be accurately reflected in the Panthersoft system yet. The lecturing professor and lab coordinators will know for sure though!",

You NEED to do social distancing YESTERDAY to slow potential spread of the virus.\n\nThis whole situation sucks, but remember that we're all in it together. It's like hitting a giant \"pause\" button on everything; none of us are falling behind and we'll get through it.",

The entire State University System of Florida (UF, FIU, FAU, USF, UCF, ...) was directed to transition into distance learning effective immediately so there wasn't really anything that could've been done. Just a couple hours before everyone thought that this week won't be affected. In fact, this was the official communication up until this other decision was made in Tallahassee.\n\nTiming was a bit surprising but everyone knew that it was going to happen eventually.",

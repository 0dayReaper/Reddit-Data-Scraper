I noticed that I have chosen my school schedule to work around my job rather than the other way around. It\u2019s not difficult. But it\u2019s not easy. I have two jobs right now to afford off campus rent and still have found that school is do-able. But Im also switching to computer science, meaning that my classes will get harder",

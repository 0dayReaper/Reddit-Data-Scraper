    "postText": "Hey y'all,\n\nI was accepted into the masters in history (online) program today. I was wondering if there were any current students or alumni that could give me some more insight into the program? Its currently a top 3 program for me based on what I already know, but I'd love some deeper insight from students.\n\nHow comprehensive are the classes, and what classes are typically offered online? I know selections can be limited. How readily were you able to develop relationships with professors? I've got significant research interests and want to make sure I can work with professors to facilitate my reading and writings beyond the class structures.\n\nThis relationship building was severely lacking in my undergrad program. \n\nThanks in advance!",

    "postText": "Hello! I'm currently in my last semester here FIU. I'm supposed to graduate this month. the issue is that I'm not doing so well in one of my classes and there is a solid chance i can end the class with a D. My question is whether that D still counts towards my graduation requirements. I'm doing a B.S. in Computer Science and the class is one of the additional elective classes. any help is appreciated!",

            "comment": "A D is considered a passing grade in the system but I believe your major requires everything to be a c or higher to be applicable to the degree. If you fail, you can still do the whole ceremony but you need to come back next semester to either try the same class or another elective",

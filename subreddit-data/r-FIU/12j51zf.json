    "postText": "So.. I'm incredibly confused and worried. I just found out that orientations through zoom are only offered to Transfer students. I'm a first year, not a transfer. I live in New York, I really do not think I will be able to go to this mandatory orientation if it is in person on campus, do they really expect people to fly in to attend orientation for one day? I'm so confused can someone help me",

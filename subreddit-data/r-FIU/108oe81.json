    "postText": "Hey, guys, i'm looking for some information about the architecture and interior design market in Miami. I would love to get some insight on what are the steps to remodel an apartment.\n\n\\- Do I need a permit to remodel an apartment? How do I get that?\n\n\\- Should I hire an architect or can I just hire a contractor? Is there a base price for an architecture project? \n\n\\- How do you feel about the job market for architecture and interior design over there?\n\n\\- What is the MO: does the client coordinates the reform project or is it the architectural firm? As in hire people, buy products, conduct the reform, etc.\n\nWhatever information you can provide, i would be more than happy. Thank you very much.",

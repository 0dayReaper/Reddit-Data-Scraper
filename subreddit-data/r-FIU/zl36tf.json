    "postText": "I'm a international PhD applicant for Fall 2023 (biology). I was checking with the TA/RA stipends but I'm not aware how much that would cover for the cost of living. General search, I got to know Miami is one of the costliest city to live-in. I wanted to know if the stipend would be sufficient to live with, if not I should consider different funding options.\n\nCurrent students or anyone associated with people working as a TA/RA do you mind to share the cost of living? Does the stipend cover your req? Would love to connect with people relating to this, feel free to direct me to individuals or groups or anything that would help me reg this!\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "The stipend in my dept is 25k per year. Not including fees which is about 900 for fall and spring and 600 for summer. Thats 2400 you need to take off per year roughly. If you're thinking of renting alone forget about it, you're going to need roommates. Depending on where you live rent will probably be around 2000 for a 2 bedroom apt but could go a bit lower. Thats not including electricity, water, food, and car expenses if you decide to get a car (public transportation in Miami is shit). If you don't plan on getting a car make sure to rent near the fiu area. The stipends are being increased this upcoming year by I believe 5% but we all know inflation is higher than that. We are slated to have another 5% increase in August of 2023. All that being said, it won't be easy and you're probably gunna have to hustle to find housing but it's doable, unpleasant but doable.",

To pay for tuition surcharge, parking, athletics etc. The stipend doesn't cover that. \n\nYou can survive on 2000 a month but its not easy. Also your monthly income will be more like 1600-1800 after taxes. Assuming you receive the same stipend",

I\u2019m currently a high school senior planning on attending FIU this fall, and when I was reading through different scholarships and opportunities I found this \u201ccspi\u201d program. \n\nApparently the coast guard will pay your tuition and give you a monthly stipend jr/sr year in exchange for a few years of service, and I was wondering if anyone had any experience with the program, or knew anything about it? \n\nThanks in advance!",

My only concern with it is being accepted, because CSPI is a big reason why I\u2019d attend FIU\u2026 Do you have any tips about things to do to be accepted, or any insight into how competitive the application is?\n\nVery much appreciate the response btw!",

CSPI wants to see leadership qualities. Because that\u2019s your job as an officer. You if you attend FIU and apply you will have a very good shot at getting accepted. Also you need to score well on the SAT,ACT or ASVAB. Have a gpa over at least 3.0. The application is a whole picture of you and the better the more things you do or have. Below are the following needed for the application except for medical.\n\nMinimum GPA \nAt least 30 college credits or more (60 is preferred)\n3 letter of recommendation max \nA personal statement describing why you want to be an officer\n\nGo here for detailed info\n\nhttps://www.gocoastguard.com/get-started/officer-applications/college-student-pre-commissioning-initiative-cspi-scholarship",

One concern, since it\u2019s very swampy, how likely are there any animals wandering on campus? My friends tell me they saw gators in their neighborhoods. Should I be worried ? Has anyone seen an alligator before? What can I do I if I see one?  I didnt choose night classes for this very reason.",

            "comment": "The odds of getting chased by a duck are higher (still marginal if you eat out and about). Our Modesto Maidique Campus (MMC) lakes and ponds are not connected to outside lakes and canals; hence, you will not encounter a gator on MMC. We haven\u2019t had campus sightings of alligators or crocodiles. More than likely, you might encounter squirrels, cats or ducks, iguanas, and lake turtles. There have been occasional sightings of raccoons and foxes, but those are very few and far between.  \nOur Biscayne Bay campus borders bay waters where fresh and saltwater combine. Alligators prefer freshwater, so they don\u2019t meddle in Biscayne Bay. As a rule of thumb, whenever you are close to a body of water in Florida, always be on the lookout; even if you don\u2019t see anything, keep alert. What you will encounter for sure are amazing FIU Panthers everywhere! Welcome to the Panther fam!",

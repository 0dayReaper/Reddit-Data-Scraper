            "comment": "Just finished her DataMining and OperatingSystem class. She is great. Started out rough but then got a lot better. \n\nShe gives extra credit to whoever attends class. Her practice tests and HW reflect the actual tests. She uses student feedback. Knowledage on the subjects she teaches. HW given out with enough time. \n\nHer tests are open response, but focuses on main concepts more than rote memorization. So study as if you are going to teach it, not as if you are going to be quizzed on random bits of knowledge.\n\nHer slides by themselves aren't enough. You NEED TO ATTEND. I can't stress that enough. Just reading the slides doesn't give you enough info and the lectures will give the context you need. Lots of people in OS didn't get good midterm grades, but also there would usually only be 10-12 people in lecture so that explains why. Although you should technically be coming to class anyways so I don't think it's fair to count this as a con of taking her.\n\nIt's easy if you attend the lectures, don't procrastinate on HW, and keep up with the material so you can get all the in-class extra credit quizzes. But if you don't attend and wait to do the HW, then you will have a very difficult time.",

I\u2019m wondering if she can will have a similar teaching style or if you know anyone that has taken her remotely? It\u2019s my last course before I graduate and it\u2019s her or Eddie Monteiro for Operating systems.",

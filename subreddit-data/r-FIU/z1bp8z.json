    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m a current sophomore at Washington State University studying Marketing. I am looking into a few different schools to participate in the National Student Exchange Program, which lets me be a student for one semester at another university. I might be attending Florida International University for fall of 2023 with junior status. Can someone tell me about the class rigor for marketing, the campus culture, the area/weather, and anything else you like/dislike about FIU? Thank you!!",

            "comment": "Hi! Most people will talk about FIU being a commuter school because only 4000 students live on campus. The reality is, it\u2019s Miami, so you can go to a movie on campus or a club in the city. Football game where the team is 4-6 or Art Basel which is a world famous art weekend.\n\nObviously weather on lock. It did rain all day today but it doesn\u2019t snow &amp; we get more sunshine than below 70 degree days.\n\nFIU is a Hispanic Serving university. 70% of students are Hispanic &amp; 7% are international students. Which is good because you learn a lot about other cultures and you become more globally sophisticated. For Marketing this will be big for you because most people don\u2019t know the differences within cultures but at FIU it\u2019s something you will learn. \n\nFIU also has connections to industries you may not have in Washington. \n\nHope this helps",

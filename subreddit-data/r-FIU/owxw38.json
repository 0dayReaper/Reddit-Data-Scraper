    "postText": "If you already haven't heard, the beautiful, entrepreneurial minds at FIU have devised a convenient and sneaky little way to fund you your books for the semester! For the low, low, price of $20 DOLLARS PER CREDIT HOUR you will have the option to pick up all your course books at the bookstore or delivered to you (with shipping costs!). For a standard 12-15 credit semester, this translates to $240-300 DOLLARS. The top minds behind this program have apparently (or probably are fully aware) not realized that most of the books we need can either be found online *for free* or rented for an affordable price, *if books are even needed at all*. The MOST I have spent on texts in a semester is probably around $60-odd dollars that I rented six different books for, which the professor specifically noted I would need the print versions for, as he could not accurately check for citation numbers if a version was different. The kicker? The professor later relented and allowed us to use online texts if we sent him the version of the text we used (to be clear, I'm not mad about this\u2014in fact, I'm glad as this resulted in students probably saving money).\n\nSpeaking from a humanities major, I can only attest to my experience with renting and needing course books. I don't know how bad the STEM crowd has it with any textbooks they may need\u2014this may be financially preferable for them. But from my admittedly limited knowledge, in my opinion, for the vast majority of undergraduate students, this program could result in a net loss of money after one of the most financially crushing times many of us have gone through. Not only is this program tone-deaf, but you are *automatically enrolled*. If this was truly as optional and \"cost-effective\" as the creators deem it to be, why not make it opt-IN?\n\nFor the love of God, please tell any other students that aren't aware about this. I am blessed and fortunate enough to receive financial aid, but for many students, this money will be directly taken out of their pockets.",

Tbh 200-300$ isn't worth it but if your credits are ALL STEM it could save you a lot if you end up NEEDING a brand new book with code asap.",

History is easy but a lot of work.  And if your good at math of course. If you have a job and work a lot maybe not. You have to put a lot of time into these classes and it\u2019s up to you if you think you can do it. Depends on your other responsibilities and how well you work under pressure.",

You really can't fall behind on the class though because it's structured like a layered onion\n\nIf your taking It with that Latino professor I forgot his name he lets you use cheat sheets on exams",

Managerial Accounting is easy as long as you read the chapters prior to covering the content. I highly recommend you use YouTube and search direct cost, indirect cost, factory overhead, and units of conversion so that when you start your semester, your understanding of these topics will be much better. Sta2023 is easy, I think you'll be fine.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone!! There\u2019s a cool event that\u2019s coming up for the month of May. This hackathon is mainly for students of underrepresented genders so if you\u2019re looking for something to do after the semester, I strongly recommend checking this out as Microsoft and Capital One will be there. It\u2019s also beginner friendly. \n\nHere\u2019s the link: https://events.techtogether.mlh.io/2023/miami",

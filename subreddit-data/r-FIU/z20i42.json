    "postText": "Hello there! I am a new student, and I'm supposed to start in the Spring of 2023. Three weeks ago, I selected the classes I planned to take. However, my enrollment date was for Nov 22nd (today). I went to the site to enroll, and no classes were no longer available. \n\nAre enrollment dates later on if you are a new student? How does it work? Because I have no classes to take for Spring. \n\nThanks!",

I think you can only keep track of one class at a time, but id ask friends and family to download the app and follow the other classes youre looking for so u dont lose any opportunities. Thats what i did last semester and i managed to get into the class i wanted. Good Luck!!!",

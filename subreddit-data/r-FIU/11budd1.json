If you qualify for one, the bookstore will have this information on record and you\u2019ll be allowed to purchase the one you\u2019re eligible for during cap/gown pickup at the C-Fair. If you\u2019re ordering your cap/gown online, there\u2019s a portal on the FIU-specific Herff-Jones website where you can put your PID and purchase the honor cord from there.",

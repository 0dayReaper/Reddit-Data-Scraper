    "postText": "Hi, I recently got hired for a student assitant position as an undergraduate student. I remember reading on the FIU website that a student with a job at FIU can have some of their tuition paid by FIU for being an employee for at least 6 months. Does anyone know if this offer is still available?\n\nThanks",

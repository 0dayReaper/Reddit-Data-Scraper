Also the Career Center (Career &amp; Talent Management) offers resume critique and mock interviews. Sign up at \u201ccareer.fiu.edu\u201d (no S, since not the same as FIU HR on-campus jobs site)\n\nYou are allowed to work up to 20 hours a week as a student around your class schedule.\n\nMaybe you can find one within your academic unit. Talk to your professors to see if they have a student job posted.",

Just enroll as you normally would with an on-campus class. Some classes are restricted for actual \u201conline\u201d students, but there are a good chunk of classes that are open for on-campus students too. Just be aware that there are extra fees that you have to pay if you decide to take a class online. Cheers.",

I\u2019m not an international student so I don\u2019t know specifics, but I think it has to do with visa regulations/rules. Your advisor can tell you for sure.",

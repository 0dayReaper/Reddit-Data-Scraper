    "postText": "Just committed to FIU for grad school and will be living on campus starting this summer. I currently live in a typical \"college town\" that's pretty walkable, has a decent bus system and I have a moped that I use frequently to drive short distances. \n\nI'm planning on selling my moped as I don't really want to go through the hassle of transporting it to Miami and driving a moped where I live now versus FIU I feel like is a whole different ballgame. Not sure how safe I'd feel driving on the streets. \n\nI'm not super familiar with the area and would love more insight on the transportation options around FIU. Can I realistically go without a car? I know having a car is always more convenient but if I can go without it (at least for a semester or two), I'd rather go that route.",

Uber rides get really expensive sometimes depending on time of day, I\u2019m talking $60 for a 30 min trip one way. I say get one to have when you need it but use the school bus and other affordable transportation as much as possible.",

During the weekend I mostly stay in so it's all good. There is a sedanos nearby by to do grocery shopping. And the freebie will even take you to target. In the same plaza where the target is, there is also a Publix, so you can also shop there.",

I am an avid cyclist but the whole fall semester was characterized by spontaneous, unpredictable, torrential rain. \n\nI struggled a little with depression when I started. I felt super isolated because FIU is gorgeous but in the pretty part of Miami. The ocean is far.\n\nBUT. We\u2019ve had good weather recently. I\u2019ve been able to bike longer distances and explore more. You can take a bus to the Biscayne bay campus and kayak, and swim at the beach. If you\u2019re active, you can make it work.\n\nYou will also make friends with people with cars. Offer to pay for gas and/or their ticket or a meal if they\u2019ll take you somewhere. \n\nBy far the most frustrating thing is groceries, but that\u2019s sort of just a \u201csuck it up and walk the distance situation.\u201d",

I\u2019d say try your hardest to get access to a car, that\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll get stuff done off campus in a reasonable timeframe. More of a necessity than a convenience here.",

Unfortunately like many other students mentioned, drivers down here are extremely negligent, often driving recklessly. I live off-campus about an hour away and just driving to campus skyrockets my anxiety 1000% of the time. Ride sharing can get expensive too since FIU's surrounding areas get immensely congested during peak hours. Public transportation is a bit limited too, though that is still an option.",

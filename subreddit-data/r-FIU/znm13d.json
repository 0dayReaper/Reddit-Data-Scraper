    "postText": "I went to apply for Spring 2023 graduation today and on the \u201csurvey\u201d one of the questions was if you completed any of a few options related to a research study, submitting an article for publication, and a couple other things. If you\u2019ve applied for graduation or graduated I\u2019m sure you will know what I mean. None of those applies to me. Is this something that will hinder my application to graduate with my BA?",

Whether or not you can graduate next semester is dependent on what your academic advisor, well, advises you on. \n\nThe only requirements that matter are related to your credits earned and whether you fulfilled the courses/tests needed for your specific major, nothing more as far as I know.",

What a strange thing to get hung up on.",

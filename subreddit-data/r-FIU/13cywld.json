Now it's getting closer to the final registration date and I still can't find any openings.  \n\n\nSo can I pick any class lvls 3000-4000 in any department? As electives, or are there specific Psychology electives I need to take?   \n\n\nAlso just pointing me out to a class with seats open for Online only students would be much appreciated.",

Like the commenter said, try to avoid taking unnecessary courses so you don't end up overpaying later.\n\n[Link for track sheets](https://case.fiu.edu/psychology/ba-in-psychology/)\n\n[Link for Online BA in Psychology](https://fiuonline.fiu.edu/programs/online-undergraduate-degrees/bachelor-of-arts-in-psychology.php)",

    "postText": "I keep not being able to enroll in any courses (psych BA track) online-they fill up instantly. I'm even a junior and I can't get an open seat. I live around 30 minutes from FIU so I went to add an in person class and it said I am \"fully online\" and can't do that.\n\nIs it worth going in person? I feel like I'll never graduate if I remain online.\n\nUpdate- I found it here: [https://webforms.fiu.edu/view.php?id=702522&amp;mf\\_page=2](https://webforms.fiu.edu/view.php?id=702522&amp;mf_page=2)\n\nWill the fees be a lot higher if I am not fully online, though?  \n\n\nUpdate #2: used these two calculators and determined it is the same price. [https://fiuonline.fiu.edu/tuition-and-aid/tuition.php](https://fiuonline.fiu.edu/tuition-and-aid/tuition.php)  \n[https://controller.fiu.edu/departments/student-financials-systems/bursar-cashiers/calculator/](https://controller.fiu.edu/departments/student-financials-systems/bursar-cashiers/calculator/)  \n\n\nIt is actually less expensive in person. Leaving this up to help anyone else in a similar situation",

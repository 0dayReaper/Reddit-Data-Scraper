    "postText": "My friend and I are both from out of state and were accepted to FIU. I was accepted for Fall 2023 but my friend was accepted for Early Fall to go in the Summer. It\u2019s really not possible for them to attend in person in the Summer, but the information on what options are available is pretty vague and after multiple emails we still don\u2019t have a good answer or plan. Does anyone know of students being able to take those Summer classes online? An advisor told me it depended on Availability, but didn\u2019t really specify how available those spots normally are. Any help would be great!",

I understand the appeals process for the most part, but my friend probably won\u2019t have their appeal accepted and moved to Fall Direct at least based on what I know. I was mainly wondering about options for doing the Summer semester, but possibly online, because they\u2019re not able to attend in-person during the summer. From my understanding, some students take a mix of online and in person classes anyway, and it seemed like that for Early Fall you just have to take 1 or 2 classes, so I figured it might be possible to take those online.",

If he doesn\u2019t have a lot of dual enrollment or AP courses that will cover UCC requirements it might be possible to find a few courses online (although it can\u2019t be guaranteed). He could also just take SLS online but needs to be mindful of min enrollment requirements if he is receiving financial aid. He definitely should talk to his recruiter or another staff member. Worst case, he could defer to Spring.",

My friend has a few AP credits, Human Geography, World History, and will have 12 dual enrollment math credits, although I don\u2019t know how those transfer exactly from Georgia to Florida.\n\nAlso, if your prior credits can fulfill those classes would you just take the SLS class?

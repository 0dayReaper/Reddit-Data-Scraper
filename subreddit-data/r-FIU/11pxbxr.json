However, it was honestly not that career productive, and I hated all my classes as I didn\u2019t really get into my major classes until FIU. If you have the money and resources, then yes, transfer as soon as you can especially if you are STEM or Business. Regarding the SAT, I am pretty sure that after you take a certain amount of college credits, it\u2019s not that relevant for your application.",

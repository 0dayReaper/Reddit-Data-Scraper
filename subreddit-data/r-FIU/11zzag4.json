I wasn\u2019t an active member but Alpha Phi Sigma is a cool org to join if you\u2019re planning on becoming involved around campus! They\u2019re a Criminal Justice Honor Society and they have a lot CJ related events and volunteer opportunities. They also have fun social events, so it\u2019s not always serious business. Good luck!",

I haven\u2019t had much luck on roomsync so I\u2019m trying to use some more socials to extend my search. I\u2019ll be in a Brickell 2 style apartment so I\u2019m just looking for one roommate. Other than that, I\u2019m pretty outgoing and really love to explore new places whether that\u2019s a caf\u00e9 or somewhere in nature. \n\n\u203c\ufe0fWOMEN ONLY\u203c\ufe0f Please dm me if you\u2019re interested!\n\nTho if anyone knows a better way of going about finding a roommate for off campus housing, please let me know cuz that would be greatly appreciated\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb",

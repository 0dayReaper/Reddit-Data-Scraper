    "postText": "Hi, \n\nI've been accepted into the FIU Honors College and already committed. I currently live in Fort Lauderdale, 1h and 30 min away from FIU. I am not interested in moving to Miami since the prices are extremely high, so initially I thought I'd just commute. I live with my partner, who is not an FIU student, so student housing doesn't work for us (I'm a transfer, and we've been living together for years). Also, we found a very good deal at the apartment we're currently renting, so I don't want to leave it yet. However, the more I think about it, an hour and a half of travel every day (and then back) will end up driving me crazy... I'm thinking of taking online classes instead. Does anyone know if it is possible to take online classes as part of the honors program? Also, I don't want to be part of \"FIU Online\" since I'd like to take some classes like public speaking in person. Basically, is it possible to do both online and in campus when needed? For some context, the college I am transferring from gave me all the options and I could select in person AND online classes altogether. Would love any information on online courses as well. Thanks!",

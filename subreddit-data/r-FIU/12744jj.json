We encourage students to apply as soon as possible to ensure you get your financial aid on time for the start of the next year. The best time of the year to submit a FAFSA  passed on March 1st. Nevertheless, you can submit a FAFSA now.\n\nMore Info: https://onestop.fiu.edu/finances/applying-for-aid/submit-the-fafsa/",

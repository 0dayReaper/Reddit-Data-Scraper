    "postText": "This summer is my last semester at FIU\u2026 I only have one class left. Physics 2 and lab. FIU is only offering the course with Wenzhi Li and with Kamal Kadel. Li has terrible reviews on RMP but his class is online. Kadel has really good reviews but his class is 4 days a week for 2 hours each class\u2026 that\u2019s not even including the lab. Anyone taken Li and can tell me his teaching style and how tests/grading is structured? Thank you!",

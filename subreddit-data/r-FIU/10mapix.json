I mean FIU average GPA is 4.2 &amp; average SAT is 1287\u2026it\u2019s in the top 100 public schools; so \u201ca better school\u201d would be\u2026what? UF or FSU? Test scores may not be comparable. UM? It will cost $50k a year, will you be paying OP tuition? UCF? Not better, equal. So please share your thoughts with OP",

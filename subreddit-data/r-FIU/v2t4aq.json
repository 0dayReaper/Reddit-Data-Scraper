I legitimately had someone in my group chat today say that they had to \"lower the quality of their writing\" for their next paper because apparently not meeting the requirements the professor wants on your first paper meant you tried too hard. Bunch of \"intellectuals\" that confuse criticism as a direct attack on their capabilities, then they act like they're some misunderstood genius.",

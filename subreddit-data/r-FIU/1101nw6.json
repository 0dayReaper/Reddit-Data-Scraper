For example, if a class has a high failure rate, they make it a prereq and force every student to take it to unlock other classes. It is admitting that the majority of the students at FIU are flat-out dumb. I agree with that too based on my experience. Also they make you learn programming classes from liberal arts graduate teachers. Imagine a programming professor flexing with their bullshit Leadership PhD. Give me a prof who actually is a computer engineer lol not woke professors who research gender stuff. I am not going to even talk about other professors and they way they handle stuff. And now this.... I thought FIU was a woke school lol, look what they\u2019ve been behind the scenes.",

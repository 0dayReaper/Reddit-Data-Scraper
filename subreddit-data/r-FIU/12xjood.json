    "postText": "I recently got accepted into a Masters program at FIU, and currently exploring all the funding options so I can figure out how to pay for it. I heard that assistantships pay like 80% of the tuition costs. Is it true? I want to reduce my student loans the best way possible, but I also need to pay bills so I was wondering how much stipend do they actually give in exchange for us working as graduate assistants?",

And the Return On investments won\u2019t match because projected salaries after graduation are 50-70k.",

I just got my textbook and I would like to start reading it before summer classes start. \n\nAlso does anyone have any tips for his classes? I\u2019m taking him for COP 2210 and COT 3100 (Discrete structures) both Summer C.",

I highly recommend watching this playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3Ffwsnad0k&amp;list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz \nIt follows the book he uses so you can just watch the corresponding videos every week and you'll be fine. It was a life saver for me - without it, the class would have been very difficult.",

For the most part, if you watch that playlist, you'll be fine... but every test has a random question or two that you've never seen before. Yes, the class uses honorlock - just about every online class will.",

            "comment": "COP2210 (Programming 1) is rather easy. It may be confusing at first if you haven\u2019t done any programming before. I do highly recommend paying attention to the theory behind the code and practicing what you learn a lot. It\u2019ll save you time later on.  There are syllabi online but most should follow the structure of the textbook closely. \n\nIf you want a more discrete list of topics that might be covered, it\u2019ll likely be UML Diagrams, data types, classes and class constructors, reading/writing files, if/else/if-else statements, for/while loops, arrays, certain Java methods like toString equals and possibly rand. Im sure theres more I\u2019m forgetting but its been 3 years and 3 programming languages since I\u2019ve had that course lol.",

            "comment": "Definitely for his exams, prepare for tricky questions and know how to read through the examples in the textbook. He loves to give really technically complicated questions so exam scores are usually kind of low. If you study and know how to catch errors, you should be fine; plus, he curves a bit if the class did really bad.",

    "postText": "hi! So I\u2019m currently taking 5 classes (one is SLS/ first year experience) and ofc im failing that class. We just finished the 12th and final week of this course so I\u2019m not sure if anything can be done but maybe someone knows something I dont? I\u2019m a first year, I  started in the spring and kinda just took everything at the recommendation of my advisor. Didn\u2019t realize that my bright futures would be taken away if my gpa drops below a certain # and now I\u2019m worried. My other courses are 16 weeks so I have time to make sure those are all good. But If this F counts towards my gpa then idk what I\u2019ll do ://",

            "comment": "Bright Futures requires a 3.0 GPA for their Academic scholarship and 2.75 GPA for their Medallion scholarship. Are you failing multiple classes or just SLS 1501? If it's just SLS 1501, your GPA shouldn't be too bad as long as you're doing fine in your other classes, because it only counts as 1 credit. I would reflect on why you're failing the class (trouble understanding, personal matters, absence, lack of motivation, etc.), then talk to the professor through a meeting or during office hours to see if there's anything you could do to make up what you missed. Be apologetic and sincere and hopefully they'll help you out. If not, I would talk to an advisor and see if I could possibly drop the class and take it again later (assuming it doesn't drop you under 12 credits). If either of those scenarios don't work out, just do your best in your other classes and you should still be OK (I'm assuming your 4 other classes are 3 credits each). Use a GPA calculator so you know what grades to aim for generally (always try to aim for the best you can, though): [https://gpacalculator.net/college-gpa-calculator/](https://gpacalculator.net/college-gpa-calculator/)\n\nFor the future, take a look at the Bright Futures Handbook so you're informed of all the renewal requirements: [https://www.floridastudentfinancialaidsg.org/PDF/BFHandbookChapter3.pdf](https://www.floridastudentfinancialaidsg.org/PDF/BFHandbookChapter3.pdf)\n\nAlso look at the FIU OneStop Bright Futures page:\n\n[https://onestop.fiu.edu/finances/types-of-aid/scholarships/bright-futures/](https://onestop.fiu.edu/finances/types-of-aid/scholarships/bright-futures/)\n\nAnd as a general rule of thumb: your advisor is there to guide you, but ALWAYS do your own research. Good luck, let me know if you have any other questions!",

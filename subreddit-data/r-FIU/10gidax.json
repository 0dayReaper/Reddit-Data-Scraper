The only prequistes that may be difficult will be the first accounting class that you have to take other than that it\u2019s pretty easy.",

If you want to stay on track for your expected graduation, pick a major whose advanced classes you're ready to start, not requiring you to take a bunch of prerequisites. If you're okay with sinking more time into undergrad, feel free to pick from a broader range based on your goals.",

I don\u2019t feel interested in anything( just slight about psy) and constantly at being scared of \u201cpsy degree not being worth it\u201d. But if I change my degree like to business , it will probably add another year \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

I would suggest taking some self-study courses or reading introductory books regarding the major you are interested in. Do not listen to anyone that tells you it is too late to change your major. Hopefully, you can find your passion, and good luck this semester!",

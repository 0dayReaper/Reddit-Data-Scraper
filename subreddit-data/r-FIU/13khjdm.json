    "postText": "Avoid enrolling in FIU,\nMiami is the most expensive place to live and the FIU administration does not care about you.\nOnestop and the Financial Aid offices will tell you incorrect information if they do not know and if you get correct information they do not share with coworkers to aid students in the future. Financial aid has been unprocessed for at least one semester for half of all out of state and instate undergraduate students that I know personally. Ultimately all colleges will nickle and dime you but FIU and their housing will add random $500+ charges on your account without reason and demand you pay it to continue at the university, only after you argue the charges for 20 minutes in person (or 3 months any other way) will they remove the charge.",

            "comment": "As somone who got grad and post grad there, FIU is a great college...for local commuters or international students. Would not recommend for out of state transfers. If you are set on Florida UF or FSU are better options if you have the GPA and grants, with UCF  and FAU as backups. \n\nBut above all, and for any college, if you do not have a full ride, do not get in debt for an undergrad please!! Stay local, benefit from community colleges to shave of 2 years at a discount. Avoid spending on out of state if possible, that was great in the 90s and early 2k's, but an unnecessary expense in the sorry state of college's today. Very rarely an employer will care anyways (unless you went to IVY and that's does not apply to this sub ), as long as you finished with good grades, get some letters of recommendation and do some internships, you will be fine with any state college.",

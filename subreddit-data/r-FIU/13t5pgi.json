An undergraduate psychology degree is frequently listed among the \u201cmost worthless\u201d college degrees. Instead, you should check out the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 [Occupational Outlook Handbook](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/) to find careers that interest you and pursue an education based on that. It also analyzes where people with a psychological degree end up (https://www.bls.gov/ooh/field-of-degree/psychology/psychology-field-of-degree.htm). Over 40% don\u2019t end up working in a field related to the degree, while ~15% are community social workers. While an admirable career field, the monetary return on your investment without a graduate degree is abysmal.",

There's the LMHC route if you want to do counseling. Psychology departments tend to favor doctorates for teaching university courses, but community colleges offer adjunct contracts to master's graduates (although adjunct life is ass).",

You specifically want to get a phd in psych. Whether the phd in psych is worth it, is another question.\n2. You know for certain that you will be going to medical school or law school immediately after and you are majoring in psychology because you happen to do well, grade-wise, in those courses. See point above re: general bachelor's degrees\n3. You are independently wealthy and are going to college purely for personal enjoyment.\n\nEssentially, as a *credential* the major in psychology provides zero advantage over any other major. It is in the same boat as a major in history, English, philosophy, etc.",

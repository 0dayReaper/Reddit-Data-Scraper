    "postText": "I got accepted to FIU a month ago, the major that I initially chose was Psychology BA, and I was supposed to start during the fall semester, but this week I submitted an update application to change major to Behavioral Neurosciences.  Now on the orientation section on myfiu shows that my current program is Behavioral Neurosciences but my term of entry is now Spring of 2024.\n\nI was thinking of starting during spring so that my residency status would change and I can pay in- state tuition. As of right now I'm not a Florida resident yet, but I will be in october.\n\nI also have a bright futures scholarship of 75%, so, will I lose it if I start during the spring semester instead of the fall semester?\n\nAlso, can I change my term of entry back to fall 2023?",

Also, not sure what your situation is but I thought I could qualify for residency and they said no on a small technicality so I would make sure you definitely will qualify before making any decision based on that",

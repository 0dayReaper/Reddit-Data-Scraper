    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nThis is my 3rd and final year trying to get into FIU Law. For what it\u2019s worth, I did both my Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s at FIU.\n\nStats:\n3.0 Bachelor\u2019s GPA in Business (I believe it\u2019s a 2.7 or 2.8 unweighted)\n157 LSAT \n\n3.7 GPA for MBA \n1 year\u2019s experience as a legal intern\n\nI am retaking the LSAT one last time and hoping to hit 160+. I am looking for admitted or current students to give me some feedback on what range I need to score on to get in. \n\nI know my UG GPA is low and I have limited work experience. I\u2019m looking to figure out what LSAT score would be enough to look past that.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve heard, even a 160 isn\u2019t enough in my case. Is this true? If so, what puts me at a considerable position? 162-165 range?\n\nAny guidance at all is much appreciated.",

Its really just those two metrics, nothing else really moves the needle in my experience except maybe in rare edge cases. \n\nPersonally, I was admitted in Fall 2021 with a 158 LSAT and a 3.74 GPA but I've heard the stats might've gone up. Especially the LSAT scores which were probably inflated during COVID. \n\nAlso don't neglect to apply to other law schools. UM has similar statistics but doesnt give many scholarships and is incredibly overpriced. However, Stetson and St. Thomas are very viable and would except on lower numbers.",

Based on what I\u2019ve gathered from admitted students + FIU\u2019s 2022 class profile, I should be aiming for a 165+ for favorable consideration. \n\nAlso, you are correct. The stats have risen. I\u2019ve seen people with higher GPA\u2019s and similar scores to mine (157) get rejected. It seems that FIU has been admitting in the 160s, 3mid GPA ranges. Trying to get their stats up I imagine. \n\nI have UM &amp; Nova on my list as well. I got an A from STU but my first choice is FIU so this is pretty much my Hail Mary. \n\nThanks again for the guidance and advice!",

            "comment": "Hey! I\u2019m a bit late to this post but I was admitted to FIU law so I thought I\u2019d drop some feedback. Unfortunately, law schools only care about your undergraduate GPA which means that your MBA GPA, unfortunately, does not count.  While they might look at it, they ultimately only care for the undergraduate GPA as that is what they report. According to their 509 report, you\u2019re below their 25th percentile for GPA. With an LSAT of 153 you\u2019d also be way below their 25th percentile for LSAT. \n\nA 160+ would put you at their 50th percentile which would be a very good place to be in and highly increase your chances. If you can bump that up just 2 more points to a 162 you\u2018re at the 75th percentile and your chances of admission (and maybe scholarship) are nearly guaranteed. Unfortunately your uGPA is basically written in stone (believe me I hate that it\u2019s like that too). This means that the LSAT is your only way of improving and having a chance. I don\u2019t know how many times you\u2019ve taken the LSAT but I would highly encourage you to retake it if FIU law truly is your goal. Double down on logic games and perfect the section before it\u2019s removed from the test and you\u2018re guaranteed high 150s maybe even 160s depending on your performance on the other sections. Feel free to reach out to me if anything, I would love to be of assistance.",

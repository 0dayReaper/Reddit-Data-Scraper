            "comment": "It's a legitimate company selling a low quality product with VERY questionable business practices. They lure you in with ridiculous claims of making six figures in a single summer, offering to pick up students in their PERSONAL vehicles and take them in and out of interviews (this happened to my friend and made them very uncomfortable), and the Doral office deleted ALL of their negative reviews from Yelp (still archived and viewable on Apple Maps). These are the biggest red flags I've heard about from friends and other people that did the interview. All except for one backed out of the internship. Good luck and I hope this helps \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

    "postText": "I have a professor that\u2019s really rude and aggressive in one of my art classes. They grade in a way that\u2019s really biased (if you made art of a landscape and they prefer portraits, they\u2019d grade you more harshly.) They don\u2019t give constructive criticism, they just give very vague feedback without telling you how to improve. The subject that the class is for is usually my best subject but I\u2019m failing bc they don\u2019t like the work I submit and they don\u2019t help students improve. I\u2019m really stressed because I care a lot about the subject and I don\u2019t want to fail. The class is also very stressful since the professor is just rude. They\u2019ve insulted the entire class for having a different opinion on what art looked good. Is there a way to go about this? Could I talk to someone at the school and figure it out or do I just have to keep my head down and put up with it?",

    "postText": "So normally this was an issue since the Town Miami building was built, in which the general speed of the wifi seemed to decrease by half.\n\nThis wasn't that big a deal besides Discord calls not working. (Which is a bit of a problem since almost every club on campus uses Discord).\n\nNow, I can barely even read Discord messages or connect to Discord. TikTok is banned, which you'd think would mean less people are using the WiFi, but it really seems to have decreased in quality.\n\nWho can I contact about this?\n\nThis issue seems to persist across campus in FIU_SECUREWIFI on multiple devices\n\nEDIT: Connecting to Discord occurs on my phones. The discord calling just loosing connection midway occurs on every device I own",

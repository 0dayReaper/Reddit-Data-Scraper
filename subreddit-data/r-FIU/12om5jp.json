    "postText": "I'm currently on my last semester of my associates degree, which is unrelated to computer science. However, I'm interested in pursuing a bachelors in computer science. I haven't done any of the necessary prerequisites, so I'm wondering if I can enroll in the bachelors program and complete the prerequisites as general electives. I saw that it was possible for the I.T. major, but I'm not sure if it applies to the computer science major. If not, could I complete the CS prerequisites as an I.T. major and then switch my major to computer science after completing them?",

Anybody aware of any resources i could possibly use to get the difference. Loan services, grants, work study anything through the school like payment plans. need help thanks",

This is my standard advice.\r  \n\r  \nAttending school part-time, year-round allows you to finish remarkably close in time to attending full-time in fall and spring alone.\n\nYou can find an interesting day job that will allow you to more than make up the shortfall, plus give you meaningful experience. I'd suggest a well paying trade, or if you are thinking about law school or medical school, working in an office.\r\n\nEmployers will notice. The experience would put you head and shoulders above everyone else in your class when it comes time to find a \"real\" job.",

I never recommend private loans cause they accrue debt and if you can get it through financial aid it\u2019s a better chance, as the interest rate won\u2019t be predatory. Depending on your gpa apply for scholarships even if at your old school your gpa wasn\u2019t that great everyone here starts at a 4.0 when they transfer.",

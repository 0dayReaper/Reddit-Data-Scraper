    "postText": "Im a Psychology major who graduated with her Associates Degree and I\u2019m currently in my third year still enrolled in Psychology. However Im interested in changing my major to BA in Finance but was rejected from the FIU School of Business because I don\u2019t have the business pre-core classes completed. Should I complete those business pre-core classes in the spring and try to re-apply in the fall or completely start over with an Associates Degree in Finance? Im feeling so lost any advice would help. Thank you.",

Although I don't have an in person class for the whole summer term (Summer C) am I still allowed to stay on campus with just taking my online class?",

            "comment": "Hello! \n\nFIU Housing does not have that many requirements. So, if I remember correctly, even if you are a 100% online student, you should still be able to apply for housing.\n\nHowever, I should mention that FIU's housing is in high demand and is limited, especially over the summer. If you haven't already applied, you may want to contact the housing office to inquire about availability:\n\nPhone: 305-348-4190  Fax: 305-348-4295\nE-Mail: housing@fiu.edu\n\n\nHopefully this answers your question!",

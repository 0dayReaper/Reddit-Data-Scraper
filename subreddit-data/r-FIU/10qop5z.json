    "postText": "I recently applied to FIU no more than two weeks ago and was desperately waiting for the status of my application, mind you I applied as a CS major for the fall term. After two weeks of waiting, the status of my application says the following:\n\n\u201cYour application will remain in deferred status until updated transcript(s) are received. We strongly encourage you to submit an updated academic transcript (mid-year report) for further admissions consideration. If you have earned any dual enrollment credits, we also recommend sending those college transcripts to further support your application for admissions.\u201d \n\nCurrently, I have a 2.617 unweighted and 3.150 weighted GPA with a 1180 SAT and 22 ACT.\n\nI know for a fact that my mid year report is fine this senior year as it\u2019s 4 A\u2019s and 4 B\u2019s. In addition I also took a fiu dual enrollment course the summer of 2022 and passed both classes with good grades.\n\nDespite what I believe is good enough to get me accepted in hopefully at least the summer term, I can\u2019t help but not sleep over this. If you have any tips or suggestions feel free to let me know. Thanks so much.",

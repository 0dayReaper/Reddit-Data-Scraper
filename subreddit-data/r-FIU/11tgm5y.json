I want to move into the One or Identity but I have NO idea how to find out how transportation from there to BBC/MMC works. If there is no bus from there to FIU Campus, do y'all take Ubers?",

It leaves every 30minutes, and runs from like 7am to 10 or 11pm I think.\n\nIts free for students, you just swipe your student ID card or enter your student ID number to get on.\n\nAt MMC, the pickup spot is near the school of music.\n\nAt BBC, its like in the middle of the library and AC1.\n\nThe bus is giant and has FIU logos all over it, you really can't miss it.\n\nTheres also a little shuttle from MMC to the engineering campus.\n\nLastly, they just started that Freebie service recently. You can get a free ride to or from campus to the surrounding area.",

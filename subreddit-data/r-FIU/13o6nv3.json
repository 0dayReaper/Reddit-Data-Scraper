    "postText": "I have met all my degree requirements but im missing 6 credits in order to complete the 120 a bachelor degree requires. Im currently taking the max credits for this summer semester and was hoping to be able to attend commencement and just complete the 6 credits online in fall. (moving back home so I won't be able to attend commencement if I graduate after fall semester)\n\nHas anyone done this? Would I be able to walk in commencement with only 114 credits?\n\n\\-Also, I saw on myfiu that I was eligible to apply for graduation. Im not sure if that means id be able to walk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*my advisor takes 2 -3 weeks to reply so asking her isn't really an option, next appointment available is after graduation app deadline so im hoping to get answers here!",

She told me I would have to submit a form agreeing to the terms of signing up for late graduation. The form basically said that because you applied for commencement late, tickets are not guaranteed, your name on the commencement merchandise and pamphlets is also not guaranteed, etc. After all this she declined my submission and told me that she couldn\u2019t approve my request. That I had to have completed all my credits in order to walk commencement.  My advisor said it\u2019s a tough situation because she needs to sign off on you being able to graduate and if you don\u2019t have the requirements they are basically lying and could get in trouble. Idk how much of all that is true or if she was just being difficult. Hopefully you have better luck!",

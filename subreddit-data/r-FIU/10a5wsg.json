            "comment": "**Panther Book Pack** is FIU's program that lets you rent out all the textbooks you'll need for your classes. They charge $20/per credit hour iirc. You can opt out by loggging into myFIU -&gt; scroll down -&gt; Panther Book Pack -&gt; opt-out.   \n\n\n**Health Fee** is charged to pay for all health related amenities that the clinic provides. Services include: Immunizations, STD Testing, Physicals, and gynecology services. All  enrolled students have to pay this fee. \n\n**Athletic Fee** is charged for access to the wellness center. Can't opt out of this one either. \n\n**Admissions Dep Online Payment** is the refundable $200 deposit that is required when you are first admitted into FIU. This $200 is applied towards your tuition for your first semester.",

Except, the panther book pack you can opt out of and I suggest you do. More expensive than getting the books on your own, also many books you can find free pdfs of.",

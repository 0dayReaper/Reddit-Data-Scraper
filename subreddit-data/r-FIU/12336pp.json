    "postText": "Hey! I will be sharing a room in University Apartments building for Summer C. I would like to match with someone I know or feel the vibe with rather than just randomly getting someone assigned. I am a 20 year old female and I am majoring in Business Administration in Logistics and Supply Chain, I was born in the US but I was raised in Colombia. I am very organized and clean and I am also a very open person, I am very active so I like going to the gym or doing things rather than staying in my room. I am a new transfer student so I don't really know anyone... DM or reply if interested so we can talk more :)",

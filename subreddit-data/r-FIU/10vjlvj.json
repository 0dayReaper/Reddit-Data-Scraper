    "postText": "I need your help! I lost a navy blue wallet in the Artist Studio area (mainly along 7th Street) that contained my One Card, Learner\u2019s license, Venmo Debit card, health insurance card (and a bunch of other cards), and some cash and change. It magnetically folds like a cell phone case, and has a zipper in the front. If by chance you find it, please turn it in to either GC Lost and Found or GL Lost and Found. I have reported it to them plus campus police.",

Every time someone loses a wallet or a phone I\u2019ve noticed so many nice people that have returned it to Lost and Found. Wishing you the best! Hope you find it. Just not sure where the Artist Studio area in MMC Campus is \ud83e\udd14",

I\u2019m not on campus today but it you could let this person know and they could stop by. It sounds the same.\n\nThis was a message by Professor Jennifer Printz. They have it!",

            "comment": "I don't know if you'll get the recording, and I don't know if this helps you, but I was there. I am very familiar with a lot of her work and her talks. I've been following her for years. It was more or less the same message that she gives. So, if you could find something similar online, it's okay.\n\nOne main difference is that now she is showing the viral video of her and the release Wounda, the chimp. If you haven't seen it, definitely look it up.\n\n(That being said, I am beyond grateful to have been in attendance. I've waited years for the opportunity).\n\nWe expected better questions and discussion with Mireya Mayor, so several of us were surprised at how bad it was. Dr. Mayor asked Dr. Goodall a few questions from kids, but the questions she asked Dr. Goodall were questions Dr. Goodall has received hundreds of times, or was discussed in the lecture. No dialogue at all; very stiff. A lot of \"yeah, yeah...\"\n\nA lot of individuals around me were laughing at FIU's opening remarks about being a leader regarding protecting the environment. It's like they thought the audience would forget about stuff, like, knocking down a part of the nature preserve, or killing animals on campus in 2020, knocking down more trees, etc. I used to pickup trash, bags filled to the top, when Tamiami apartments (or w/e it's called now) was under construction. So much trash being thrown around. Many of it got stuck in the lake and trees by student housing--a lot of plastic bottles around. Students have also seen workers dumping the recycling bag into the garbage bags. Yeah, we know the problems with recycling, but that's not the point. It was also weird seeing people carrying a bunch of plastic water bottles (one woman was carrying, like, five or six) during the lecture, but then again, we weren't allow to bring water inside. \n\nAnyway--\n\n**tl;dr** if you don't get the recording, check out other videos of her talks and the Wounda release video. Some people not happy with the Q&amp;A session and others laughed at FIU's opening remarks at being an environmental leader.",

Just to be clear, she is an expert primatology, primarily chimps? I had a question about if chimps are undergoing their own evolutionary process, and will they look like humans in a million years or maybe earlier. If she still talks about that subject, I\u2019d be interested to hear more about. Also I wanted to know more about her first hand experience with chimps were. \n\nI\u2019m a little all over the place, but thank you so much for replying and I will look up those things later.",

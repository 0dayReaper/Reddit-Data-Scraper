Gender neutral bathrooms are more for the individual to feel safe while they use the restroom. The bathrooms themselves aren\u2019t particularly special or unique, they\u2019re just single stall bathrooms so trans or gender non conforming people can use the bathroom in peace. I hope that clears it up for you! :)",

It\u2019s not that a regular bathroom is not inclusive, it\u2019s that if you\u2019re a non-binary or gender non conforming student, it can cause dysphoria to use a restroom that\u2019s labeled \u201cmen\u201d when you don\u2019t identify with that gender. Cis people don\u2019t go through that problem because all public restrooms normally conform to their binary gender identity. Not to mention representation. Imagine if every restroom was labeled Adam and Eve. And everyone was either named adam or eve But you were named Bob. It would be annoying to always use the restroom that\u2019s not labeled with your name, let alone never see your name represented. Or better yet, imagine if everyone referred to your dog or cat with the opposite gender. You\u2019d get pretty sick of it every single time. It\u2019s the same way with NB and Gender Non conforming people. It\u2019s not so much that they need a special bathroom labeled for them, as much as it\u2019s that they would like a place that is free from judgment, prejudice, preconceived notions and labels. They\u2019re humans too.",

I apologize for not stopping, I did turn around at some point to walk back in that direction. You were gone by then, you were cute too. You never asked for my number or anything or gave me a name. I regret not stopping :/ it seemed like it took you some courage to approach me and I'm not really sure how to find you again.  ",

Some guys really do have to build up a lot of courage to talk to girls. Good luck! I hope you find the guy and talk to him. If you need any help at all from my side, feel free to ask. ",

But it does have the previous classes and grades showing. However the GPA for those are not listed in the unofficial transcript. My current GPA is completely determined only by the courses I've taken at fiu. \n\nBtw I learned recently that if u failed and repeated the class, u can ask for grade forgiveness(up to 3 attempts on transcript) for only fiu courses.",

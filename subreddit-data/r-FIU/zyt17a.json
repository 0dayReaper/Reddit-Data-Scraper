They had much higher requirements at that time.\n\nI was under the impression that test scores are no longer a factor to enter college or university due to COVID-19.  They go mostly on your GPA and extras like community service hours and such.\n\nMy son is going to MDC primarily but he also plays in the FIU marching band.  So if he wanted to transfer, he is already in.\n\nGood luck",

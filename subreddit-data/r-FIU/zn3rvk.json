    "postText": "I got into FIU as a graphic design major and I am going to be attending at the I-75 campus in the fall because I live in Weston and it would be better (and safer) for me to commute to campus via I-75 rather than the long journey to FIU's main campus in Miami. What is I-75's campus like? Based on Google Maps, it seems very small. I also see that Broward College is sharing the building (which kind of concerns me I don't know why). What's it like?",

The staff there is very kind and does dedicate a lot of time to host things and giveaways for the students that choose to take classes there. \n\nNow as a student myself here are my opinions: \n-it is a smaller campus but for commuters coming from broward it\u2019s super convenient and way less of a hassle to get to campus as opposed to driving up and down all the time. \n-it\u2019s much easier to get your class work done without the distractions that the mmc would have\n-always a parking spot available\n-easier to navigate through\n-there are study rooms you can book to use for quiet time for homework, study sessions, etc. if you find yourself missing student life at the main campus it\u2019s not like you can\u2019t go there on your own time to hang out",

You can complete a lot more classes and even pursue your entire degree depending on the major at that campus. Overall I think you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s nice not to have to waste gas money on the commute from Weston to mmc",

            "comment": "My biggest concern about i-75 is that they don\u2019t have any place you can get food from, or any social life whatsoever, so no gym or barnes and nobles, or anything really. It is purely a place you go to if you have a class or two and to get a study room if you need it. Also, if the commute is better for you then that\u2019s a big plus. It\u2019s quiet and calm and has a nice layout, but is tiny with not much going on. Sometimes FIU will host small events where you can get some food and snacks and drinks there, but not very often. I go there for one of my labs and just spend the whole day there once a week.",

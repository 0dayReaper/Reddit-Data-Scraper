Has anyone ever done this, and if so, were you immediately dropped from the course with a prereq? Or do I have until the beginning of Fall to get the required prereqs before I'm dropped?",

However, please remember to drop the class if you end up not taking or passing the prereq - if for whatever reason the system doesn\u2019t drop you you\u2019ll be responsible for the course.",

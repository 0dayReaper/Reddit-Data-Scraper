I would look over your degree requirements well, you will find Communication &amp; Public Speaking is a requirement in virtually every major. \n\nAlso, welcome to University (not just FIU). There are going to be a lot of classes, especially in the first 2 years (where you're completing Gen Ed requirements) where you will have 0 interest in them and really don't want to do them, but you have to. Better to bite the bullet and get it out of the way. I would advise to finish all the shittiest classes you don't like first, so that way things get better over time.",

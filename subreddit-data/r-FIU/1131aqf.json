Bc we have mountains of PowerPoints and stuff to download to look through to complete 1 assignment. This mainly happened at the beginning of the semester so ig we are finally getting the hang of it. Also I agree with the email part. The last email we got from her when we were confused was her having an attitude and telling us everything we need is the modules.",

    "postText": "Hello! Has anyone taken digital culture with Professor Gutsche? I know it was called something else at FIU, but I have him now and he teaches very differently to a point where he barely teaches at all. Midterms are coming up and he's allowing us to use notes, and l'm wondering if there's any of his past students or if someone know anyone, who just so happen to take notes or has old ones. Or if someone can dumb down his midterm or give an idea how it would go?",

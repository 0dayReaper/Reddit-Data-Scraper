    "postText": "So I\u2019m trying to take an online class but it\u2019s not allowing me to enroll. I\u2019m assuming it is bc the spots are reserved for exclusively online students. Is there anyone I can contact for access to this class? Is there a way? It\u2019s the only way this lab will fit into my schedule.",

Most departments have walk ins on certain days and times. If not, send an email with course code and other pertinent information.",

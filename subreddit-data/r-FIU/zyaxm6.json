    "postText": "Hi y'all,\n\nAs mentioned in the title, I'm a student at University of North Florida (UNF) and am looking to transfer to FIU in the summer. By the end of Spring 2023, (assuming I pass all my classes) I will have 65 credits. My GPA at the moment is 2.15 (not good, but it's a long story) and I am currently majoring in Transportation and Logistics, and have taken all my business pre-reqs as well as completed all my gen-ed requirements.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan anybody give me some advice as to the best way to transfer? I was under the impression that Connect4Success would be the way to go, however, I just recently learned that process is only open to *State Colleges* and not other public, 4-year universities (I thought State College just meant 'public college/university'). Any advice on my chances of getting admitted to the Logistics &amp; Supply Chain Management program? I have 2 related internships under my belt, and am working on bringing up my GPA, as I let it get down during my gen-ed, which were boring courses I didn't care about, whereas my business courses (both lower and upper-level) I have done much better in, mainly because I actually care about those classes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank y'all in advance for any and all insights you give me. I look forward to hopefully being a Panther soon and joining y'all in the beautiful city of Miami.",

Once you start at FIU your last gpa doesn\u2019t matter, once you get your first semester done, whatever you end with is your new GPA starting over.",

You can also write your story as part of the admissions letter. I don\u2019t think you should give up. Post pandemic, academia is hurting for enrollments, so I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll find a way. FYI I\u2019m a Panther alum.",

I will take your advice and reach out to an advisor on Monday and have a conversation with one of their advisors and see what I can find out. I think I can make a pretty strong case in an admissions letter (I'm a strong, persuasive writer, and I also had a lot of challenges and issues that I dealt with but I also have a lot of experiences where I picked myself up and bettered myself significantly).",

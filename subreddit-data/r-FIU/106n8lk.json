They will open classes not a day sooner, answer emails once a week, and feed you a cookie cutter course that meets their minimum requirements.\n\nThe notion of breaking down complex ideas in a way that makes sense, you know \"teaching\" escapes them.\n\nBelow is a link on how a professor could grant early access.\n\n\nhttps://blogs.jccc.edu/2021/06/23/open-canvas-class-early/\n\nEdit: Below is another link, since I'm getting alot of criticism from professors for calling out their ineptitude.\n\n\"Before the semester begins\n\nGenerally speaking, you will be allowed access to the Canvas courses that you are registered for 10 days before the start of the semester. If you are unable to access your Canvas course within 10 days of the start of the semester, then your instructor may not have published the course yet. Some instructors may prefer to only allow students to access their Canvas course on the first day of classes.\"\n\nReferance: https://support.canvas.fsu.edu/kb/article/961-how-user-enrollments-and-course-access-work-in-canvas/\n\nWelcome to FIU\n\nCheers",

It is that simple.\n\nThe root cause here is that these professors don't monitor or care about online classes. Its ran on autopilot while they charge you tuition. \n\nSo to answer the OP. It will open on the 9th. You will hardly receive support from your professor. And you will have to learn the material on your own. So prepare yourself and welcome to FIU",

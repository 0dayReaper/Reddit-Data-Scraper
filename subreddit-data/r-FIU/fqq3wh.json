I teach very large classes and I think the WhatsApp group does more good than harm. I have no interest in what goes on in these groups. That is none of my business. However it can do harm: almost every semester there are problems with rumors and misinformation spreading like wildfire throughout the group. And because there\u2019s no one there to check it, it just continues on. It seems like every semester students will come to me at the end having missed an exam and saying that they thought we dropped the lowest exam. When I ask why they think that, they say because the WhatsApp group said so. Now they have a zero for exam and there\u2019s absolutely nothing that can be done about it. So there\u2019s good and bad. There\u2019s always going to be individuals in the group who are completely out for themselves. You can read some of the comments in this thread and see that there are people who don\u2019t care about anybody but themselves and will go to any measure to assist themselves even at the detriment of others. You always have to take that into consideration. I hope all of you are taking care of yourselves and your families and staying safe. Peace.",

If you're an online student they're your only chance to network, and chats let you ask the questions your professor refuse to answer. But once the deadline for a project or assignment comes out- dummies flood the chat. If chat groups were anything like reddit, their post would probably fall to the bottom.",

If the professor\u2019s office hours are on the front page of the course on Canvas, why do you ask the group chat? For all you know, they can be wrong. It\u2019s much less typing you have to do if you just open Canvas.\n\n&gt; because they didn\u2019t know what to do with their homework\n\nEh... debatable. I\u2019ve asked people in group chats for help with solving problems when I don\u2019t have anything else to turn to, or when the material\u2019s confusing me somehow and I don\u2019t have access to the professor (for example, in my 2am study sessions).\n\nI\u2019ve seen people get in trouble for simply being in the same group chat as other people who do cheat, and although they didn\u2019t take part in the cheating, they still suffer the consequences. That\u2019s what\u2018a unfair.",

Some didn't even know how to find academic sources. I just left. I'm gonna get an A, so I have no worries.

Why do you rejoice in the idea of people failing because they don\u2019t understand the material? There\u2019s nothing wrong with asking for help.\n\nLIFE ITSELF is about asking for help.

They obviously made the student feel uncomfortable and didn't know what to do. \nagain its rare for this to happen but you never know, so always be aware that anything like this can happen.\nSometimes we don't know the reason why people do it.",

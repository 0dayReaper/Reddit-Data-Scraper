    "postText": "Hey, incoming freshmen! This is your boy Chad! Numba #1 advice I can give you to impress the ladies at FIU and get invited to all the parties is by driving around campus in a 2000s Ford Mustang; **Especially**  an automatic V6. Bring the ladies to your car and it's a guaranteed panty-dropper, Brah.\n\nMake sure you rev your engine every time you're at a stop sign and red light to impress the ladies and fellow bros out there. Also, make sure to speed down the parking garages to let everyone know you're a badass!!\n\nThanks for reading this. Peace out! Vape everyday!\n\nChad\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c47f64k6zb831.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=76c13651d8ff11786ddc3f9e90054e93d8ea220b",

When I asked, and they rechecked, of course it was fine and they corrected it. \n\nNo I never reported them, but I would have if they didn't fix it.",

She is giving me low grades on lab reports saying Im missing data when I included it . I also made a comment asking her why she took off if I included it and she\u2019s ignored it as well.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve been having trouble with my roommate/roommates. I came back from spring break to see that the whole place was really messy and the sink had old food in it that smells bad. The fridge and freezer are full of old food and I haven\u2019t been able to put anything in there since winter break. It was bad before spring break, but it\u2019s getting unbearable. I don\u2019t know what to do bc the inspectors didn\u2019t say anything about it. I never see them and don\u2019t know who\u2019s causing it, so I don\u2019t know how to talk to them about it.",

    "postText": " This is the last place you would want to work for. The managers are extremely rude and have anger issues. They would get aggressive (over a freakin cookie!) if you forget to do minor things and/or make a small mistake, and act like they are hot stuff just because they make like 2 dollars more than you. The job requires you to to do night shifts and close after 2am so if you don't drive, you will be walking home at the dead of night by yourself. Not to mention that it is something that they would fire you for if you are not able to stay that late. ALSO, they fire you over text out of the blue and make false acclaimations that they were trying to call you due to their lack of professionalism. It's like working with a bunch of kids. The pay is a joke, $9/hr, really? That's not even enough to buy a proper lunch. Overall, it's not worth it, save your dignity. Go work for people that actually respect and appreciate you. PS. you're allowed a free water and one free cookie per shift that most likely gets taken out of your paycheck. :)",

Those that don't raise their wages to the new minimum face federal penalties and could be sentenced under federal charges for violating federal law. In your case your saying inflation has barely any involvement in wages but it does. Inflation lowers to value of money making that 9 an hour a 4 in value at best at this point compared to the actual minimum wage that tries to make a secure baseline income rate for the average american.",

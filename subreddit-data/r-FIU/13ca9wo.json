The AI one could have been better, classes were recorded and you had like one assignment per week (or even less) about readings and stuff but it was very basic things. \nI liked the EI course. It was interesting, you had to watch some tedtalks (they were great!) and read about things related to how to cope, strategies, etc. you also had one assignment per week and it was more about your experiences and what you learned from videos\n\nI recommend you take the EI one if that\u2019s something you are interested in and the workload is not that much, besides it provided me with many anxiety techniques. The AI one was not that good. \n\nI will take the understanding data badge this summer term. If you wanna know about it lmk.",

I remember the professors would send us announcements that basically said if you didn't participate in the first two weeks of the class then you would be unrolled or something like that.\n\nI have never unenrolled so I don't know like the exact procedure",

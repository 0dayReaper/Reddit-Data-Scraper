I don\u2019t want to block the number in case it\u2019s ever actually useful but if they call and text everyone literally ten times a day, everyone is going to block it and it\u2019s going to completely negate the point of the system. Very on brand for FIU tbh.",

People will block the number, tune them out, and not pay attention after a while.\n\nFIU alerts should be reserved for cells directly threatening the campuses, not stuff out in the everglades.",

    "postText": "So I am a ex-biomed student transferring to FIU for IT online. I\u2019ve been out of school for a while now so I\u2019m a bit rusty. I start in Fall and would really like to \u201cpractice\u201d/study before classes start.\n\nI am looking for a copy of the syllabus \nfor COP 2250 with Pisano and ENC 3249 with Sohan. It doesn\u2019t even need to be these exact professors I just need whatever I can get. Any information on the assignments would be of great help.",

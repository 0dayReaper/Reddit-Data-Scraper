    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nSo I have been accepted as a transfer student into both UM and FIU Honors College. I am leaning toward FIU because I received a full ride, and it offers more flexibility with online courses (I work full-time).  My major is in political science, minor in sociology, with a 3.9 GPA. My dream school is YALE Law, which I know is very difficult to get into, and I am setting my expectations very high. I started studying for the LSAT this summer (2 years before I need to take it), and I am really focused on getting some internships + more activities before graduating. Anyways, I was wondering if anyone has any experience getting into an Ivy League after graduating from FIU? If so, any tips? \n\nThank you in advance!",

Unlike Ivy undergraduate programs, Yale Law, along with every other law school, won\u2019t really care about where you went to school. They will care far more about your GPA, LSAT score, and the diversity (both intellectual and cultural) you bring to the table. You will make your case for the latter element in the personal statement you submit with your law school application.\n\nAccordingly, I would go with the cheapest option \u2014 FIU. Minimizing the loans you take out now is very important given the current interest rates you would be paying. Your future self will thank you. Additionally, FIU\u2019s Honors College is a phenomenal program.",

            "comment": "Since you are talking about law school, specifically, the formula is simple:\n\nhigh GPA + high LSAT = admission. Nothing else matters\\*\n\nIf you graduate with a 3.9 and a 175 LSAT, you will get into every law school from Harvard on down, regardless of extracurriculars.\n\nIf you graduate with a 3.5 and a 165 LSAT, you got essentially no shot at T14.\n\n\\*Yale is a little bit of an outlier since their class is so small, strong soft factors will matter, but neither UM nor FIU gives you a leg up here (we're talking about meaningful work experience, curing cancer, etc). Also, if you are an underrepresented minority (URM) the GPA and LSAT thresholds drop significantly. The effect is strongest for American Indians, then African Americans, and then the rest.",

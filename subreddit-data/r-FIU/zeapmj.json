Next, I recommend that you enroll in the forensics certificate program you can find more details following this link:[https://gfjc.fiu.edu/education-training/undergraduate-certificate-in-forensic-science/](https://gfjc.fiu.edu/education-training/undergraduate-certificate-in-forensic-science/), this will show what courses to take.  Most of the professors I've had have been fair and nice. a note I would give is make sure to take excellent notes because I think they are now starting to require students to take the ABC exam toward the end of the program",

It\u2019s a LOT of content so I really don\u2019t know if I can take in every single detail in the notes/hw. Let me know or message me privately!",

His quizzes are pretty easy and classes are well structured. \n\nThe midterms can be tricky, but if you are able to do all the learning assignments you will Ace them.\n\nHe can however be a bit difficult to understand, so you'll need to study on your own.",

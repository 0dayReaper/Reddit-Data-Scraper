I also don't want any excess worry. (Again, personal opinion) This doesn't constitute something that should concern the student/alumni body at large; One person threatened another. I spent 6 years or so on campus, and was threatened with violence several times, and it never seemed like something worth sharing.\n\nWhether or not you agree, do you understand where I'm coming from?",

Taking precautions such as these (I didn\u2019t even come on campus today because of the threat) are meant to protect yourself from possible harm. \n\nMy keychain consists of my AirPods, house and mailbox keys, a pocket knife, a mini flashlight, and pepper spray.

As the saying goes, it's not the bullet with your name on it you need to be concerned about, but the one addressed 'To whom it may concern'.\n\nMy only problem is that you were in no more or less danger today than you were yesterday or tomorrow. Unless you were the target of this threat, any precautions either should already have been there or were excessive. For example, it seems we'd agree your pepper spray was already appropriate whether or not you'd seen this post, as you already had it. I hope we'd agree that shutting down the school would have been excessive.\n\nConsider this: If, somehow, every threat made by one of our 50k+ students was posted here, what would the frequency be? If it turned out to be one a day, would you just never go? What was it about this threat that justified more precaution than all the threats you didn't hear?",

It affects how the suspect behaves and might open them to a lawsuit for defamation.\n\nHere's some stuff they *could* do that you wouldn't know *anything* about:\n\n* Cooperate with Facebook (WhatsApp owner) to collect information about the account and related phone.\n* Track the location of that phone via Stingray.\n* Review years of CCTV footage for the suspect, looking for suspicious or alarming behavior, or justification for unrelated apprehension.\n* Park across the street from him, tail him with a car full guns and cops who can use them.\n* Increase rotation of plain clothes officers embedded on campus.\n* Assign a detail of cops to wait inside a reserved room in GC.\n* Contact other police departments, like the suspect's hometown PD, for anything they have on the suspect.\n* Review ATF documents in the suspect's name (and other persons of interest; Dad's gun) to see how recently the gun was acquired and what other weapons the suspect might have access to.\n* Arrest the suspect without grounds.\n\nI'm not saying they've done any of this- On the contrary, I'm saying neither of us would know. Some of the stuff we could never know, most of the stuff we wouldn't find out for a few days. This is their job, and we shouldn't assume, without any indication, that we'd do better in their shoes.\n\n---------\n\nSo what's my point? Only that I want you to know that **you are safe**. Of course, it's not a perfect safety, and it's not so safe you shouldn't be vigilant. But it is as safe as you were last week, last month, last year. As safe as you are anywhere else. I know we can't control our innate fears anymore than we can control any other emotion. We can, however, choose our actions in spite of fear.\n\nHere's a story of mine from when I was working on campus: I was driving my piece of crap car to work when a slick, brand new muscle car mounted a curb, drove over a divider and into a roundabout. I slammed on the brakes as well as the horn, but was not going to be able to stop in time. Luckily, I was able to turn out of the way and come to a stop with the help of a curb (instead of T-boning him).\n\nWe managed to extract our cars from the roundabout, and he pulled up behind me, revving his engine and calling me maricon. Yeah, yeah, whatever, hotshot. I pulled into Blue garage, looking for a spot. It's full :(. I go into Gold and find a spot. As I get out, I notice the muscle car has followed me- Presumably *been* following me.\n\nHe gets out of the car and gets in my face, saying some shit about me having a piece of shit car, about not having a work ethic like the rest of my race, that I was probably stupid, too, and that I probably didn't know Spanish. I answered back that he was making me late for my second of three jobs, and that there's no way he bought that car on his own, and in Spanish I told him I knew Spanish, in German I told him I was learning German, and in English I told him that at least I knew how to drive. \n\nWell he wasn't having that. He knocked me down. Before I could get back up he said he didn't have the time to beat the life out of me, but he knew my face and car and if he ever saw me at this school again he'd fucking kill me. He threatened me, directly.\n\nAside from ego, though, he hadn't done any damage. If he had broken a taillight or side view mirror or something, he might have caused $20 of damage. If I hadn't gone to work, it would have cost me $50+. If he had followed me for the rest of the day, I would have been afraid for the rest of the day. If I looked over my shoulder all day, I would have been afraid for the rest of the day.\n\nIf I made my decisions based on my fears, my actions would have hurt me, not him. And they wouldn't have made it any less likely that a psycho stalker would kill me in my sleep.\n\nDid hearing this story make you any less safe than you already were?",

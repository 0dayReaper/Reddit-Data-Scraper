I have called back to back multiple days and have gotten the \u201cour phone lines are currently busy assisting other students\u201d and then it ends the call. Last time I was waiting for 1 hour and 40 mins only for them to tell my they would email me in 3-5 business days\u2026 that was 8 business days ago. \n\nDoes ANYONE know how I can reach an admissions advisor within a normal amount of time? Literally anything would help.\n\nThank you so much guys",

    "postText": "Hey y'all, as you can see from the title, I've just submitted my gradaute application to FIU and I was wondering where now I needed to send in my transcripts. There wasn't a specific place in the application to send them (unless that's what \"supporting documents\" was for) and I read online through their website that we should send them separately after you submit the application. So from here should I just contact my old schools and have them send it electronically? Or do I get the transcripts from them and send it myself?",

Few real trees (palms are commenilids, not trees but more like a grass, and they provide no shade), tons of wasted space on grass lawn, and tons of ornamental plants which are invasive to Florida.\n\nIt's bizarre to me that FIU can call itself \"world's ahead\" and boast about having a landscape architecture program while its own landscaping is such trash.",

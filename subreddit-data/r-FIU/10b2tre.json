    "postText": "2 days ago I was stopped by a guy working at Vivint, after telling us that you could make 20k-30k during a summer internship I was invited to attend one of their meetings. I went and they seemed really friendly, there was a ping pong table, a pool table, etc. The actual presentation came and it all seemed too good to be true, they were giving out cars, vacations, and apartments to employees for what they made it seemed like easy work. They later handed us some sheets that said what some people were making when they started out vs what they were making now, some were making 6 figure salaries at a very young age according to them. At the end they gave us free pizza and some people competed for 200 dollars. After I left I was very excited to join them however after thinking about it I thought it all seemed too good to be true. What I\u2019m trying to say is if this is all a big scam or if people are genuinely having a good experience at Vivint.\n\nTL;DR Vivint seems too good to be true and I want to know if it\u2019s a scam or if it\u2019s all true.",

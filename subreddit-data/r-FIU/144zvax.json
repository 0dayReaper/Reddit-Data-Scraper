If there is any difference between FIU and UCF in the eyes of employers (there isn't, they're both ok), it will be dwarfed by this fact. UCF is no hub for anything.\n\nNeither has a name brand/network/\\[insert buzzword here\\] that will allow you to find employment with any random degree. It's the substance of your field that controls.",

            "comment": "*Sharing the following from our friends at the College of Engineering:*  \n\n\nFIU\u2019s Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering (MME) offers a curriculum that is designed to give the student a thorough understanding of the basic laws of science and advanced analysis and design skills to stimulate and develop creative thinking, a professional attitude, economic judgment, and environmental consciousness. The department offers BS, MS, and Ph.D. degrees in Mechanical Engineering and MS and Ph.D. degrees in Materials Science and Engineering. Mechanical and materials engineering are and will be, of critical importance in areas as diverse as space exploration, environmental control, defense, energy issues, transportation, and bioengineering. The aim is to develop the student\u2019s potential to the fullest, to prepare the students for superior performance as mechanical engineers, and to provide the students with the fundamental principles necessary for pursuing advanced study in the diverse fields of engineering, science, and business. The MME\u2019s Masters\u2019 and Ph.D. graduate programs cover a range of subdisciplines: fluid/thermal sciences and energy systems, materials design and processing, nanotechnology, robotics and manufacturing, and multidisciplinary computational design &amp; optimization. The department is focused and committed to giving its students a world-class learning experience in an environment that strongly promotes research, innovation, and ties with the industries. Presently, 85 FIU engineering students are working on research in support of NASA alone.",

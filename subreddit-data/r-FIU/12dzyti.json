    "postText": "Hello everyone, I\u2019m a 22 year old Computer science major in my junior year. I understand that this might sound very off-topic, but I recently lost almost all of my friends at FIU and I\u2019m trying to start fresh. Particularly I\u2019m looking for friends that like to go out a lot, as that\u2019s my favorite way to bond with people, whether it be simply going to mall or enjoying the nightlife. I just don\u2019t like being cooped up inside my house. I prefer to be very social and meet new people and I want to be around like minded people. If this sounds like you, please feel free to DM me!",

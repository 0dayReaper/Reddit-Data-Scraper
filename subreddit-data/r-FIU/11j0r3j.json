As soon as my quiz got flagged for review and escalated to academic affairs, I sent an email to both my professor and academic affairs coming clean about my antics and that I was embarrassed and ashamed as soon as I did it.

You'll receive a case document from the school via email so watch out for it and it'll give you the details of when you can attend a hearing with the Affairs people where you can talk it out(doesn't really help to alleviate the situation in most respects, unless you're arguing AGAINST the charges). Keep your chin up and head down for about a year and you'll be clean.",

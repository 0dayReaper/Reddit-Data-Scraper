If you see a lot of bad reviews from one group but a lot of positive from another then the negative reviews are probably from ppl with poor work ethic. If you know you have a great work ethic, then look at the positive reviews. If the reviews are overall poor then that means the teacher is just difficult for everyone",

In my experience, only students  who hated the class and a few that loved the class will add reviews. The N sample per class that add comments is too small to know if is correct. Also, sometimes people post more than once for the same class and people that didn\u2019t take the class post. \n\nThe bottom line is in life, people are going to be different and you just have to aim for an A in every class for whatever instructor is assigned. That said, there are some that are terrible. But passing a terrible professor says a lot of who you are. The experience is valuable too.",

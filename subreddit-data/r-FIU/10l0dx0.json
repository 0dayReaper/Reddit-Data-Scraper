    "postText": "Hi everyone! \nI am currently a senior at FIU and after Spring 2023, I really only have 2 more courses to take until I graduate. Since I changed my career path to PA, I been also incorporating courses into my psychology major track that are sciences. My only thing is that I still have some courses left to take until I finish the prerequisites to enter a PA program BUT for my psychology degree, I have 2 courses left. Has anyone had the experience of graduating in the Summer semester? I feel as if it doesn\u2019t feel official and since I am a first-gen student, this will be a big deal for my family and I. I decided I still want to graduate before the year ends and just take the courses I need for PA school. Any opinions on graduating in the Summer?",

I\u2019ve attended multiple graduations since transferring here back in 2022. Spring , Summer and Fall all graduations were big and celebratory. To the point its separated into 3-4 days cause of the amount of graduates by programs and degrees with each day having a few hundred graduating. And each day whole campus is blocked and packed. So you really won\u2019t feel nor really care what season it is.",

I\u2019m sorry that it seems i\u2019m worried about the wrong thing but I also didn\u2019t know if they do big celebrations during summer since my CC was really small and made me wait until Spring to do my commencement. I appreciate the feedback",

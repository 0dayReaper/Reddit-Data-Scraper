I had friends at UF who were STEM majors take some courses at FIU during the summer and said the courses at FIU  were easier. I\u2019m a liberal arts student so the classes pretty much similar but my classes at UF were a bit more difficult compared to my FIU classes. Hope this helps if you have any more questions you can dm me.",

            "comment": "So back in Jan 2020 I actually moved to Gainesville to transfer to UF from FIU. Even though I\u2019m back at FIU I do have some insight to help you with your decision.\n\n1. Cost of Living: Gainesville is cheaper than Miami in a lot of ways, but by no means is it actually cheap. For instance, there are student apartments that cost as low as $500 in a 4/4 within 10 miles of the campus, the closer you get to the campus, the more expensive it is. Plus while rent is cheaper for the most part in Gainesville than Miami, gas, food, and electricity bill are all overpriced in Gainesville.\n\n2. Financial Aid: I can\u2019t speak for myself but from my friends that went to UF, financial aid for whatever reason wasn\u2019t as great as FIU. Obviously it depends on your needs and some other things and it\u2019s a case by case basis but I did want to add that.\n\n3. Classwork: UF is one of the highest ranked schools in the nation, so it feels like they try to make the work hard to weed out the weak. There have been assignments from professors in UF that literally copy and pasted from assignments from Harvard. On the other hand, at least my experience at FIU, there\u2019s so much \u201cbusy work\u201d with FIU professors. To a point where I sometimes feel like I\u2019m not actually learning anything valuable. Depends on the professors and major obviously.\n\n4. Diversity: I\u2019m ngl, if you\u2019re a minority looking for other minorities, UF probably isn\u2019t the best place. FIU, especially the BBC campus, felt very diverse. UF is a predominately white school, but don\u2019t get me wrong, everyone here is pretty chill. Just as a black guy, I usually do feel more comfortable when I see I\u2019m surrounded by a more diverse group of people.\n\nBut like other people are saying in the replies, don\u2019t switch for namesake. No employer is gonna say \u201coh pick him, he went to UF instead of FIU.\u201d You have to pick what fits the needs of your future the best. If it helps, FIU imo is a great business and law school while UF is an arguably better STEM school.\n\nUh that\u2019s all I could think of, if you have any other questions, just lmk \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe",

Unless the cost of attendance is less than at FIU you're wasting your time and possibly money for a school that nobody is going to be impressed with. \n\nUF as a school is fine but nobody is going to look at your resume and \"They went to UF, they must be top notch\". \n\nThe major difference between FIU and UF/FSU is that they play on national tv every Saturday and we don't. If going to UF saves you money then go, if it costs you more than you're spending now (out of pocket or via financial aid) then don't.",

Employment opportunity categorically will be better from UF, not purely because of name recognition (though it helps) but because recruitment at UF is superior to that at FIU. You simply will have more frequent and more meaningful contact with prospective employees at UF than at FIU.",

The cost of living in Gainesville is way cheaper than Miami and they have a lot more off campus housing to choose from. UF also has a lot of school spirit that fiu does not. If you truly want the \"college experience\" I would go to UF but if you really need to save money go to fiu. Personally I wouldn't let money be the only determinate when choosing because memories are priceless and you'll never get to be a young college student again",

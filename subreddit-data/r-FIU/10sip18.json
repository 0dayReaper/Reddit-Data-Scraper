    "postText": "I applied to several schools for masters in higher education administration. I'm interested in international education in particular. I currently attend UF for undergrad and it seemed logical to apply since I'm already here and I'm comfortable. I applied to FIU because I was always interested in living down south and felt this could be a good opportunity to. I'm also Latina and liked the idea of attending an HSI and living in a larger city with a more diverse community. \n\nWhen I got my acceptance to FIU about 3 weeks ago, I was really excited but wasn't ready to commit. I just got my acceptance to UF a couple days ago. I'm feeling conflicted for lots of reasons. I feel UF is a safe option, my life wouldn't change much at all, but FIU would definitely require me getting out of my comfort zone and starting over. \n\nWould love to hear from those attending FIU about your experience.",

Check which attracts your attention more and that you think will be a good fit for you.\n\nI would also suggest checking what the cost of attendance will be for both (housing, tuition, books, fees, etc) and compare them to see which will be more convenient for you. \n\nBest of luck to you!",

I also applied for a MS program in education at FIU and the program director gave me a great PDF with information on the program, the requirements, as well as the schedule for the classes in the upcoming terms.",

(at least from my personal experience from driving between both schools) they have a lot of scholarship opportunities and miami is extremely diverse and has so much going on! the rent is\u2026 something else but housing at FIU isn\u2019t bad price wise. it\u2019s also a beautiful laid back campus, always stuff going on. come down here !!!",

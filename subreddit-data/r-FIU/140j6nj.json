    "postText": "Literally the second after advising the website was down for me. By the time I could register for courses, everything my advisor told me to take was filled. \n\nThe waitlist capacity says 0, does that mean nobody is in the waitlist and I should join asap?\n\nI'm very worried I won't be able to find any summer courses. I just got housing too. If anyone can give advice, or toss a general elective other than MUH 2018 or the Public Speaking thing I'd greatly appreciate it.",

            "comment": "I been out of school for a good while but generally speaking, a zero on the waitlist means there is nobody on it. That said sometimes nobody is on it because there is no waitlist. Some classes just have a hard cap with no waitlist and you just have to keep checking to see if somebody drops. Now, again, I was last at FIU as a grad student back in 2018 so stuff might have changed. \n\nAlso take the Public Speaking. I work in government and I still use some of the stuff I learned in that class from when I took it at Dade.",

If this would be your first W, it should not impact much, but it will be there. I don't know the process of law school, but if they interview you there may be a chance that they can ask for it, so be prepared with an appropriate answer for that.",

I got accepted into FIU's graduate school for my major with a few W's on my transcripts (I explained my circumstances in my personal statement and letters of recommendations also emphasized that, they did not question me about them). \n\nW's do not affect your GPA, so it's the best case scenario if you don't think you'll pass the course (been there before, it sucks a lot). If it's a repeating pattern and your PS does not touch on that, they may question it.",

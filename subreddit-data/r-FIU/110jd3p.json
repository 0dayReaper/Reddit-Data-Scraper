How is the program? Difficult? I took calc 1 so I think I should be able to switch my major with my academic advisor.",

BUT I will say that I\u2019m transferring to FIU from an out of state university, I took classes all the way up to my junior year there for CoE (calc 3, diffEq, linear algebra, etc) and comparing the curriculum at FIU to my current one\u2026 it looks so much easier. None the less it\u2019s still engineering so it\u2019s not like stupidly easy. Especially if you\u2019re not gifted in math\u2026some of the classes are pretty tough still.",

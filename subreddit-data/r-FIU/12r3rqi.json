    "postText": "Hi i\u2019m a senior in highschool currently deciding between Florida international university and Loyola. I just wanted to ask this subreddit a couple questions since I want to make sure to know as much as possible before commiting. If you even have one question that you\u2019d want to answer I would appreciate it a lot as I really want some insight from people about something\u2019s . I have a lot of questions so feel free to skim over and just answer the ones you want too if you want to answer any at all.\n\nHow diverse is the school? I\u2019m a pakistani bisexual man so it\u2019s important to me that I find a school that is diversified. I want to meet a lot of new people from different backgrounds.\n\nHow is the campus social scene? I would consider myslef a social person who likes to go out a lot and I want to be around people who feel the same way. I like to go to concerts and parties but I still love hanging out in small groups and exploring new places. I consider myself pretty adventurous and social and want to be surrounded by people who are similar\n\nHow is the psychology department and overall education. I\u2019m majoring in psychology possibly with a minor in sociology and want to become a clinical psychologist in the future so I want to make sure i\u2019m going into a school that helps me with that.\n\nHow has your overall mental health been? This is really important for me as I have severe winter depression which i\u2019m worried about for college. I just want to know what everyone overall mental health has been like and if the campus or location of campus has impacted your mental health in any way. \n\nShould I be worried about the florida governed and it\u2019s policies? I consider myself a liberal person and want to be around left leaning people and i\u2019ve heard lots of things about floridas government changing policies. Is this anything I have to be worried about at FIU?\n\nFeel free to answer even one of these question and I would really appreciate it a lot. Thank you in advance!",

            "comment": "Honestly, FIU sounds like FIU would be a great fit for you. \n\nThere is a lot of diversity at FIU, and people from virtually everywhere. \n\nPeople are mostly on the liberal side. \n\nPsychology is our biggest major and there are a bunch of resources for students and opportunities to do research with professors.",

            "comment": "I think you would very much like FIU. \n\nFirst of all there is no lack in diversity in general in Miami, albeit a large part of that diversity is Latino diversity. Nonetheless I\u2019ve met people from dozens of countries from every continent and everyone is very welcoming. Also there\u2019s a very large LGBTQ community both on and off campus, you\u2019ll fit right in. \n\nNext, FIU is NOT a party school, but people do like to party. Our Greek life is pretty bland but it\u2019s Miami so you\u2019ll always find a good social scene. Most are very open to meeting new people in the city and socially inclined and that\u2019s very much reflected in the University. \n\nAlthough people like to make fun of us as a dumb school or whatever we do pretty well. We\u2019re decently ranked in the U.S. and in like the top 5% of best universities worldwide and we continue to climb the ladder every year. We also have huge research programs in various fields and we\u2019ve gotten the highest BAR scores in the last 7 years (even beating out UM). Psychology is a big major here so you\u2019ll find a ton of resources and high quality professors. \n\nAs for the mental health thing it\u2019s ok, but getting better. There\u2019s lots of resources for mental health support for students and they\u2019ve started to prioritize that in the last couple of years. Not sure where you currently live but in Miami there\u2019s pretty much two seasons: hot with rain and hot without rain. We get a week or two of cold weather and then it\u2019s hot all year round, seasonal depression isn\u2019t really a big issue here. Now, the city is definitely growing and getting a little fast paced, I\u2019m from LA originally and Miami isn\u2019t currently at that level of chaos, but it\u2019s slowly inching towards that. The city wants to become a tech and business hub so things can sometimes get chaotic, but there\u2019s some special charm in this chaos. It\u2019s a very chill and relaxed city (except for the road rage and the drivers)\n\nFinally, people are very liberal in the University so there\u2019s not much of an issue there. There\u2019s a growing presence of conservatives in the city but to be honest it\u2019s just a bunch of influencer type people who really don\u2019t comprehend politics and just see instagram flashy news and base their votes on that. I\u2019ve got friends that voted for DeSantis because he kept everything open during COVID but they\u2019re also pro choice/ pro drugs/ anti organized religion and they have no idea what DeSantis really stands for. You\u2019ll be fine here, I was. \n\nI\u2019ve lived in a couple of cities in a couple of countries. I\u2019ve been exposed to many lifestyles and realities and I\u2019ve met people from all walks of life. Moving to Miami somewhat felt like an epitome of a lot of that. I don\u2019t really think I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life here, but moving here 6 years ago was one of the best choices I\u2019ve made. Living here is definitely a unique experience and FIU is an awesome school. I\u2019m glad I chose it and I think you would love it too.",

    "postText": "So i kinda had a confusion over my charges on my account and called about it and was basically given false information about my florida pre paid and had to confirm with pre paid about it and didn\u2019t end up paying for my classes til like 10pm. All my classes are already dropped from canvas and i\u2019m freaking out. Has this ever happened to anyone and were able to get your classes back after paying? or does anyone know what i can do?? I really don\u2019t wanna wait til Monday to fix this cause i feel like the more I wait, the worse it is (trust me, i hate knowing it\u2019s the weekend now). I know OneStop is closed tomorrow but there has to be at least SOMEONE there right? i literally wanna cry",

Meaning, FIU is going to look at all your credits earned from the institute from your associate and pick the classes that will transfer over to them. This is assuming that the associate is from a USA institution. Otherwise they will require additional things from you. \n\nEven if you have an English lab with a B, if it is not needed for the purpose of accepting you into the institution, they will \u201creject\u201d the class and accept the rest. \n\nDoes this help?",

            "comment": "Whether it is an AA or AS makes a difference, but in general, if it is from a Florida state college or university, all credits will transfer. \n\nIf you have an AS, I would recommend completing the AA before transferring over. The AA satisfies all the general undergraduate requirements at FIU, but with the AS, many of your credits will likely be electives.\n\nGoogle the FIU UCC (university core curriculum), your transfer credits will be applied to that (with the exception of major prerequisites).\n\nGo to [transfer.fiu.edu](http://transfer.fiu.edu) to schedule an appointment with a transfer advisor.",

    "postText": "This question is for students who graduated and have a chosen name in the system different from their legal name.\n\nI'm graduating this semester and I have a chosen name in the system. It shows up on canvas and in class rosters, and I've never had an instance where a professor used my legal name after I entered my chosen one in my.fiu.edu. I'm sure this isn't a very common issue, but I was wondering if anyone knows for certain that my chosen name will be what is read during Commencement. I know that my legal name is what will be written on my diploma, but I haven't been able to find any concrete answers on what name will be read during the ceremony when I walk across the stage.\n\nThank you for any help.",

I\u2019m taking the SAT in March and trying to aim for a 1300, studying 3 hours everyday. I would rather start in fall however if summer term is a better chance for me I wouldn\u2019t mind.",

I believe you only need to take one class in the summer semester to be enrolled. If you know that applying for summer term versus fall means you have a higher chance in getting in i\u2019d say do it, even if it means taking a class during the summer time. I also started my first semester in the summer term. It wasn\u2019t that bad! Good luck!",

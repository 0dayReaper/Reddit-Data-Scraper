I used to do this as well, before realizing that all it does is make people take us less seriously. The perception that we're only half a step better than community college already exists and people who go here reinforcing it does nothing but us. You'll never hear someone who goes to FSU or UF shit talk their own school, we should follow suit. ",

The campus is better than any other school i have attended.  The SIPA is a hidden gem that can launch you into a career straight out of school.  The SIPA is heavily recruited by national agencies and has a good reputation among peers.  I would rank FIU ahead of UM on both cost and quality of campus.  Its easy to find parking in the mornings on both MMC and BBC.  That\u2019s my opinion and I attended FIU.",

            "comment": "Good question, ill take a bite out of it. \n\nThis is a common problem that happens with any school in any state that is not the \"top school\". Go to Georgia and you will hear people from UGA talk shit about people who go to Georgia State, its not an uncommon situation. \n\nFor me I graduated from UF before coming here to FIU. During my time at UF I shit on every other school in the state. Why did I do this you may ask, because I knew just how hard I had to fight to become a UF student. This is where the first part of people talking bad about FIU can come from. Many people know that compared to a majority of other Florida institutions it is on the easier side to gain admission. This removes that sense of competitiveness that most other schools have which feeds into the school being highly regarded by people who know of it. Also comes the legacy of being a UF or FIU student. Ask how many kids go to one of these schools because their parents and grandparents went there. They are schools of tradition. \n\nNext up is the sense of community. When you go to UF or FSU, most people are there for the entire 4 years, and they live either on campus or within a couple of miles. This forms a community of students who are all there for the same reason (usually) of it being their first choice of school which makes them proud. Unfortunately FIU has not been able to accomplish this yet due to the young age of the school, and for it being a commuter school. Besides going for classes people do not spend time on campus. Not spending extended time on campus removes all sense of community and turns it into what almost feels like going to work. You go to class, put in the time, and leave. \n\nLast reason I will touch on is sports. Think about UF, FSU, and now even UCF. What do they all currently have in common? They have a major sports program. UF is established as being one of the top schools for nearly all sports. FSU has the top sports and the lesser known sports are starting to develop more. UCF has gotten the ball rolling with a great football program. Now when you think of FIU do any major sports come to mind? Can you consistently watch these sports being played on TV? Schools with top tier sports are tied to the idea that they also have top tier education ( this being true for UF, FSU is a bunch of idiots... ONLY JOKING). People come together around sports in college and it is what makes a large amount of students love their school. Have you ever been to a UF football game or seen one on TV? Check out the crowd even in some of our worst seasons, we have a fan base that makes people love the school no matter what. For FIU it is hard to create this atmosphere with the sports they currently have. \n\nSo in the end I would say most of FIU getting the bad reputation has to do mainly with it being a young school. It needs time to develop and create the community that other schools have. Eventually it will have the chance to turn into a more positive community once it gains more graduates and develops its own long lasting traditions. ",

            "comment": "This is a pretty interesting post, usually it's people from the outside who like trashtalking FIU for being a glorified CC. Personally, I haven't run into anyone from FIU that talks badly about FIU, either people just go here and remain neutral, or we love it. The only reason I could imagine people badmouthing this school who go here is because they're copying others from the outside who talk poorly about us. My advice would be to just tell people who badmouth it to just bug off, it does nothing good for us. \n\nWe go to a good school, a great school in my opinion. I'm happy we're not a school that's only known for our sports. We have plenty of good academic programs, but the only reason people don't know much about it is because we don't talk about it. The reality is, for some reason, people really love sports, and it's easy to talk about. I personally hope we don't turn into a school that people only talk about for sports, but if that ends up happening, at least people wouldn't view us as a small step up from CC. \n\nNow it brings the question, what can we do to make our image better? Honestly, social media. Share more of FIU's posts, be more engaging with social media that is from FIU, just do more things that gets the word out there that we're prideful of our academic programs. Eventually, even the people who commute are going to start staying on campus more just to see what the hype is about from social media posts. I'm a transfer from UCF and from day 1 I've never felt the need to talk trash about FIU, I just felt a lot more comfortable here. I just liked it more from the beginning. Anyway this place is great and don't let anyone convince you otherwise. ",

I also used to have that type of mentality in the past, until I applied and attended here, and was absolutely amazed of how great of an institution FIU really is. FIU offers multitude of opportunities to not only better yourself and become successful, but also to make a difference and have a great time!!!! PUT SOME RESPECT ON FIU EVERYONE!!!!!",

I heard numerous complaints *outside* FIU, like by family members and high school classmates. However, even though school spirit isn't as extreme as somewhere like UF or UM, I never saw people talk bad about the school itself. I was initially disappointed I didn't get an opportunity to go to a different school, but I received so many opportunities from FIU that I would have *never* received from another school. I'm proud to be an FIU alumnus. \n\nAlso, could you be talking about an online problem? I'm at Georgia Tech now and the reddit is filled with people complaining about everything. I don't hear people complain in real life though.",

            "comment": "Most of the trash talking, Ive heard of is usually has to do with the higher up administrative people, typical politics of the university. Especially from people that work and or are doing Phd/Ta stuff. However, they also admit in the same breath that FIU has the best teacher and programs for specific areas of study. Not only that they have a huge network of local job opportunities. Like employers know fiu is a good spot which is what important.\n\nEdit: also for the quality education FIU is pretty cheap. Like it still has its issues and should be addressed but the quality and expertise of the people that work in this school is amazing. Some people that have actually been accomplished in their field. Like try to look up some stuff that your professors have published from time to time and it can be really eye opening, the things they have worked on or the connections they have. ",

FIU is also the youngest when you compare it to UF or UM. It\u2019s recently been catching up, but again, very recently. \n\nFIU isn\u2019t a bad school. People just talk trash about what they don\u2019t appreciate. ",

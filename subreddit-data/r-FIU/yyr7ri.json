I don't know him but I'll also take that class with him in 8 weeks and I'd instead experiment with him (MD Shafiul Islam) a thousand times than with Watson. With Watson, you learn absolutely nothing, and by the way, the study material is more than 15 years old, so out of common sense, you know. Now, at this time, you will have the ability to make this decision.",

            "comment": "Can't speak for FIU, but at other schools I've been at, the procedure was to go to the professor whose class you needed and ask pretty please for them to sign you in as an overload.  IOW, it was up to the professor teaching the class as to whether to take on more than the normal number of students (which makes sense, since they're the ones who'd be taking on the extra work of teaching more students).  If you needed the class to graduate, they'd usually accommodate you, except occasionally when their department had forbidden them from taking on overloads (which sometimes happened).  \n\nWhile you wait for your advising appointment, maybe you could stop by the prof's office and see what they say?\n\nAlternatively, keep a very close eye on the online registration page because somebody may drop, which would give you an opportunity to swoop in and grab their spot.\n\nBest of luck!",

Back in December 2020, I literally changed my major in the middle of my final semester from English education to English Lit because the internship portion was badly coordinated (this was MDCPS fault). I had gotten switched from supervisor teacher three different times that I just said screw it out of complete frustration.\n\nThat resulted in me missing two classes for graduation, and this is what happened for me:\n\n1. I had reached out to the professors of the classes that I had needed and both were willing to let me join the class (yes, even one for a mini term because of the urgency as long as I felt I could catch up). \n\n2. My academic advisor was able to reach the department head of my new program. He was super nice  and used two of my previous education courses to waive the two new english classes I would have needed to complete my new program. \n\nThere are people willing to help. Especially in your circumstances where you are not at any fault and when you are so close to finishing your program.",

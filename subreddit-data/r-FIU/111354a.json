Say you want to make sure all was recieved, and what to expect at this point.\n\nMy guess is, you are on the top of denial list, but if someone withdraws you might gain acceptance that way. So they wait a little and see what happens.  But it also might be whoever supposed to do it is out sick, or they didn't recieve it. So call. Many calls they wouldn't appreciate,  but one call after this length of time should be okay.",

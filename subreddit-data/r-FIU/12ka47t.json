    "postText": "Hi I recently appealed to get into the early fall STEM STEP program. I was talking to some other girls who were also accepted into FIU for the summer and they said that they were doing online classes and dorming in the fall but I\u2019m not sure what they were accepted into. Is there any chance I would be able to do this program online at all? Are there any majors or ways that could allow it? I currently have my major as chemistry BS.\n\nDoes anyone have any other advice for trying to get in for the fall? I\u2019m from the north and going in the summer sounds a little overwhelming and too soon as 10 days after I graduate high school I would have to move in and going in spring 2024 doesn\u2019t sound super good either. What should I do.",

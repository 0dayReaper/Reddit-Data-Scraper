I think the place in graham center is way more better and less complicated. I forgot what it's called, but it's s right up next to the panthertech. Unfortunately, you have to pay and speak to the person there to pay after you've printed what you needed to print. It's not a lot though. I think it was 0.24$ per paper printed.",

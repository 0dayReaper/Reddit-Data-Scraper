My gpa is enough to be part of it; however, all the extra responsibility makes me question if its worth it just to travel to London for one summer semester. Is it worth it? Financies aren't a problem.",

His scholarships carried on and he was able to win another scholarship that the program promotes. Just research on fiu's abroad programs, you definitely do not need honors.",

            "comment": "Honors Study Abroad in Honors is different. Each program (7 now, soon adding Greece and Korea and bringing backSouth Africa-pre-Med) has a theme. The Spring semester (3-credits) is prep based on the theme, gives you background, helps with language, etc. Summer A or B (3 credits) you are in country for 30 - 32 days. They fulfill 1/2 Honors requirements if you join as a sophomore or junior and it can be an elective for you. Each one has 12 - 18 students and is led by experts. I went to the Vietnam-Cambodia- Thailand program and it changed my life. It's like the best thing Honors does. It is not tourism and it is not a semester abroad where you end up taking a bunch of online courses in a different time zone and are mostly lost in the streets. Do your research and talk to people who have actually experienced all options. Do your own research. Nothing like hearsay to waste your time and take you down the wrong road.",

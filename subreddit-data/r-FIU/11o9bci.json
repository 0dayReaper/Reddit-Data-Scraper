            "comment": "Well I\u2019m my experience as a current senior in highschool that just auditioned is cool, people is nice and overall the experience beyond being stressful is quite comforting.\nI also applied for jazz guitar, got the audition at 10:30\nAfter a while I played with the Bass Player Mr. Ousley.\nYou have to bring your own tunes and see what happened \nI messed up a bit in a fast tempo chart but everything was ok.\nThey were nice, asked me why I was interested in the major and that was all.\nIt was quick since there were many other people waiting for the audition.\nBeyond, I just had the regular keyboard and music theory test.\nI hope this helped!\nGood luck",

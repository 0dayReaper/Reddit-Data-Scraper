He used to teach via PP slides with minimal actual programming on screen so a lot of the work you did you learned on your own. It was Java at the time not sure if that is what is being taught now.\n\nThe work was not crazy difficult but if you have no programming experience I think he isn't the best for developing newcomers. His grading wasn't too strict but again if you aren't already good at basic programming his stuff could be a little difficult without working on it with others.",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m planning on applying to FIU for the fall 2023. I\u2019m transferring from a 2 year community college. I previously was at a 4 year college but after a year there I transferred back to the community college, just for this spring semester. \n\nOnly issue is that at the 2 year college my GPA is about a 3.3 but my gpa at the 4 year college is a 2.0\u2026 and I was on academic probation\u2026I really messed up there. So knowing this, what do you think my chances are at getting in or how can I increase my chances.\n\nAlso for some context I\u2019m applying for Computer Engineering online bachelors",

You apply as a non-degree seeking student to an in person class with a professor in the Department that you want to be in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou take a class or two, (two is better), you pass them with an 'A'. Then, when you're in the classes, you connect with the professors. make sure the professors are 1. full time non-adjuncts. 2. not assholes on Ratemyprof 3. it's preferable they have a title, like undergrad prog. director, or chair. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, after you connect a little bit with them, you tell them about your situation. You feel bad, you cry, whatever, build empathy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, with them saying they'll help you, (they probably will, if not ask), you apply, and get in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSource: Me.

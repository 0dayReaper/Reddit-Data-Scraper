Depends if they have a stove though. I think the mattress in UA is a twin size but bring sheets, pillows and a mattress pad for whatever size the bed is. If you get there and there isn\u2019t a microwave and nobody else brought one, it may be worth investing in one. Same for a mini fridge if you have roommates who might take your food. \n\nThe issue is gonna be though if you have to go back to your home lugging all the heavy crap back or getting rid of it when you no longer live on campus.",

Adds a bit more cushin and keep the nastyness off of your sheets.\n\nAnd alright then yea moving stuff shouldn\u2019t be too much of an issue then. If you had to fly in it could be a problem leaving.",

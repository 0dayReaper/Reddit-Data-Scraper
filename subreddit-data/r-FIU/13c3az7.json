    "postText": "I plan on changing my major from English Education to English Literature to skip the Student Teaching semester. If anyone that has done this swap of majors can help me determine if the swap is worth it and if many of the classes resemble each other and will still count for my degree in order to not have to take too many extra classes for the new major. (Side note: I have an advising appointment scheduled for this swap for June 6th as it was the earliest possible, but if anyone can help me with this inquiry, I'd appreciate it!)",

The classes relating directly to your major (English) are going to be transferable. There will be a good amount of classes you\u2019ll have to take specifically for the literature track. A lot of the credits towards the English degree are English related electives, so some of the education classes can be transferred. Check your degree audit and compare it to the eng lit requirements you can find online. Compare it to your excess credit counter, too :))",

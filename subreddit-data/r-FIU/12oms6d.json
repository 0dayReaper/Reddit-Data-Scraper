    "postText": "So my academic advisor was telling me what classes I should take for the summer and suggested I take one of these classes that med schools prefer but I have no clue which one I should take:\n\nSOP 3004, SYO 3400, ANT 3462, PSB 4002, or EXP 4604?\n\nAre any of these easy? Or any of these particularly hard, so I know to avoid it? Thanks.\n\nEdit: Searched for SYO 3400 and PSB 4002 and it said \"no results found,\" so I guess those are off the list for summer.",

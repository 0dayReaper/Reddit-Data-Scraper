    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m interested in this program as an out of state student. I\u2019m about 5 classes away from completing an associate of arts and suck at math so I\u2019m choosing the BA path. For those who are in or graduated from the BA program, how hard would you say it is? Do any of you work full time and is it advised to have a job while attending? I\u2019m in an accelerated software development program at the moment (Year Up) and will begin an internship next month for the next 5 months. I hope to get converted to a full time employee at this company or I also have the option to become an apprentice for any tech related role upon graduation. Since I will have a lot of on the job learning, I honestly just want the degree for a stamp. How much time is required weekly to pass? I\u2019ll add that I do have a list of the \u201ceasier\u201d classes and instructors names.",

The most difficult classes were Systems Programming, Computer Arch and OS. Also Advanced Unix Programming was time intensive and fairly difficult, but I still recommend it. I worked fulltime and took 1 class a semester.",

            "comment": "I graduated back in December and I did a mix of in person and online classes. Some classes are difficult if you have a bad foundation when learning to program like Systems Programming or OS. Other classes like Computer Architecture are just convoluted because of how low level you go in the class. \n\nThe major isn\u2019t easy, but it won\u2019t be horrible if you pay attention and apply yourself. It sounds like you already have a decent foundation in programming due to the dev program so you should be okay. \n\nIf you secure an internship and full time position that will be great as you\u2019ve gotten your foot in the door very early on. I recommend maintaining that job while you do your classes. If you need to drop to part time classes because you\u2019re overwhelmed do it, unless you cant for scholarship/grant reasons\n\nAs far as weekly time requirements, I\u2019d say 10-20 hours for depending on the classes you have. I always took 5 classes so that increased the time I had to invest. There were times where I was bogged down the whole week (some of these times were due to my own neglect) , and other times I struggled to find something to do. The only advice I can give is be proactive, and get stuff done well in advance.",

Session A is the full length courses, Session B is an 8 week course that starts when the session A ones do, and session C is an 8 week course that starts half way through the semester and ends when the Session A ones do. \n\nAs far as how long it will take, depends on what classes you have at the time when you start. You should speak with an FIU advisor prior to selecting classes to ensure you\u2019re taking what you need. For the BA you\u2019ll need interdisciplinary courses, as well as the core classes and electives. It took me about 2.5 years cause never did summer classes and took some extra classes to broaden my skill set. If you know what you want, plan it out and take the max number of classes you can do it in a little over a year. I don\u2019t really recommend blasting through it though. You\u2019ll get burnt out hella quick and you\u2019ll have no life, especially if you have a job. Average time would be the same as your AA I\u2019d wager.",

I just don\u2019t want to commit to something long term as there is a DoD Cyber Security fellowship that I want to try to get into this coming January. \n\nSince I started at FIU as an online student in fall 2020 I was forced to do the BA since the BS isn\u2019t offered online. I transfered to in person classes in fall 2021 but still as a BA. For the BA there aren\u2019t many classes that are required. The highest level classes that I took as prerequisites were Pre Calculus and Discrete Math when I was at Broward College. The BS would\u2019ve required Calc 1&amp;2, Stats with Calc, and Physics 1&amp;2 if I remember correctly. There\u2019s also 2 capstone classes where you do a senior project. \n\n\nFor the course work itself there\u2019s a decent amount of logic involved but not its not super math heavy. There are some things like Time Complexity that are easier to understand with more math, but its not overly complex. If you want I can show some code examples of the stuff you might be doing when I get home. Obviously not ripped directly from the courses but something comparable. \n\nIf you had issues doing Algebra/Stats in HS/college I recommend the BA. The only stipulation is that you can\u2019t do the CS grad program with the BA, you can however do the IT and Cyber Security grad programs.",

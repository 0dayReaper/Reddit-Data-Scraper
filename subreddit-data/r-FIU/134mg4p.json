I could have easily gotten 75% tuition waiver If I applied under the November 15 deadline. Can I get such scholarships in the next semester once I get enrolled??  Please help as today is the deadline to confirm admission\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

Then you'd have to apply to a bunch and wait but even then you'd have to do task for some to then get the money at a later date.",

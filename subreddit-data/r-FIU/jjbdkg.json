If you know of any other free or discounted resources specifically for FIU students just put the FIU webpage link down below and I will add it to the site. Also if you have any feedback on the site just comment below.   \n\n\nThe website is [discountcollegestuff.com](https://discountcollegestuff.com/)",

I found it annoying that FIU does not have a page where they list all the free resources so I decided to make one myself.\n\nI also wanted to try out using react, connecting an email sign up form, and building something that others may find useful.",

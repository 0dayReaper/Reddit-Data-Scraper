            "comment": "I think it would be a strategic move for you to do a business major, maybe Marketing. To ensure that you're able to get into the creative directing/ social media management field, immediately join a club or two and become their Director of Social Media so you can get some practice and put it on your resume. Next step is to work toward securing an internship in your field with REPUTABLE companies every summer. Most companies start recruiting in the Fall. By your senior year you should have several relevant internships under your belt and hopefully a fulltime offer for when you graduate. Good luck!",

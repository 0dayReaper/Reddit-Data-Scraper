            "comment": "If you are interested in advancing your career with strong technical skills, the MS in Cybersecurity could be useful. However, I often see that people moving up in their organization need business skills in addition to technical skills. To address this need, FIU also offers a STEM MBA: the [Online MBA in Cybersecurity in Risk Management](https://business.fiu.edu/graduate/cybersecurity-risk-management-mba/index.cfm?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=mbacyber). \n\nGood luck!",

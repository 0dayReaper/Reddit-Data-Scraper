    "postText": "I have an opportunity to attend a MedX medical mission trip to DR this spring break. It costs about 1.9K &amp; I just wanted to fully access if it is worth it before I pay the initiation fee (it is non refundable). Would it make my medical school application stronger? Is it worth the cost? I get money from financial aid that would cover this fee but it is still money I could be saving. Opinions?",

The question is, is it worth it for YOU to spend nearly 2k to get that experience in DR or would you prefer to gain experience by shadowing/ volunteering locally. \n\nIf I were you: I\u2019d go because FAFSA is paying for it anyhow and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have downtime to explore DR should you like to",

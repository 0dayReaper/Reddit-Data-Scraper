I was wondering if it is legit because I completed virtual orientation but never received information about the required trainings. Is this email legit and can I click on the link to finish the training? If not, where can I complete the authentic trainings?\nThanks \ud83d\ude4f",

If you don\u2019t want to click the link I would reach out to the office of diversity and inclusion since it is the training topic",

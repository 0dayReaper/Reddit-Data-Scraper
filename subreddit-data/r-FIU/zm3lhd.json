    "postText": "Context:  \nHi, I wanted to transfer to FIU for its Crime Science Major, but the issue is that I am almost at my graduating point for my AA and don't meet the prerequisite for CS. I was at my pre-nursing stage, but decided to switch late. Sadly they don't take Human Anatomy I+II for Introduction to Biology and Health Chemistry for Introduction to Chemistry. I did call and asked the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice, but the person answered don't know then I asked the bridge advisor people said no, it would only count as an elective.   \nThese are the transfer guide:  \n[https://tts.fiu.edu/guides/pdf/BC/Criminal-Justice.pdf](https://tts.fiu.edu/guides/pdf/BC/Criminal-Justice.pdf)\n\n[https://tts.fiu.edu/guides/pdf/BC/Crime-Science.pdf](https://tts.fiu.edu/guides/pdf/BC/Crime-Science.pdf)  \nQuestion:  \nCan I transfer into FIU for Criminal Justice, and later transfer major to CS?",

You can declare the major and work on the prereqs and after completion you can go on to the core courses. In my experience, I was able to enroll in core courses and currently enroll in STA2023. However, Programming I requires that you have completed Precalculus and Trigonometry. \n\nHope this helps!",

    "postText": "Am a senior at fiu have like 7 credits left till i graduate which i will take in the fall for my bachelor's. Now i am looking to take and get another degree at mdc when im done, however i wanna start as soon as possible on it and was wondering if i could take it at mdc at the same time I'm doing my last semester in the fall at fiu. I saw fiua rules say i cant get credits outside of fiu for my last 30 credits regarding dual enrollment that said excuse me if i misunderstood that, but that means i cant get necessary credits for my bachelor's at fiu transferred to fiu right? If im just taking another degree, essentially classes i dont need to be transferred to fiu, then it doesnt matter, i can just start taking those course in the fall at mdc for the new degree while im also taking my 7 last credits at fiu for my bachelors right? I also just need to register to mdc and take my courses and dont need to sign up as a transient or dual enrollment student right? If anyone could help me know if thats okay id appreciate it\n\nhttps://case.fiu.edu/advising/transient-students/\n\n\nhttps://cec.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/How-to-get-authorization-to-take-a-course-at-MDC-or-BC_v4-floridashines-org.pdf",

If you take the last 7 credits at FIU then I suspect no harm no foul will be the answer.   The registrar at FIU is the key,  Make them put it in writing!\n\nGod Luck",

Just know that you can only get financial aid/loans whatever at one school. Initially both schools disbursed financial aid to me, then I had to pay 5k out of pocket to the school I got my first bachelor's from to get my transcripts to transfer classes. At the end of the semester they said I had a bill because I couldn't get gvmnt loans for 2 schools. It kinda sucked because that was all my savings at the time, lol.",

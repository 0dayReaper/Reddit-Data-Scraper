I keep seeing things about the potential for loans being cancelled so we don\u2019t have to pay back and I wanna know if there\u2019s a chance I won\u2019t have to pay back mine! Thx",

That being said, I believe you are referring to the Biden administration\u2019s $10,000 federal student loan forgiveness initiative. Unfortunately, it has been held up in the court system as an unconstitutional exercise of Biden\u2019s presidential powers. The case is at the Supreme Court now and they will have the final say. I think it is unlikely we will see the Court find the action constitutional and everyone will keep their loans.\n\nNote: this is only for federal loans. If your loans are private, this forgiveness does not apply to you.",

It revolutionized enterprise resource management for thousands and thousands of companies and student administration for many universities.\n\nBut as we know technology moves incredibly fast and peoplesoft is becoming a legacy system pretty quick.\n\nMigrating from a system of such a massive scale to something new is next to impossible and would take years to complete. Yeah it might be a little clunky to use and slow, but It works most of the time for me, and if it works just fine why replace it? Especially when we all know FIU isn\u2019t going to pay a penny for a new system.\n\nUse my course scheduler if you find my fiu hard to use. I use both to find classes.",

And, FIU's system really isn't that bad compared to the various systems on the market. Also, it would be important for OP to note that, in RFP's for SIS systems, there is rarely any consideration of the student experience. Clients want to know what their administrative staff and faculty will be able to do and at what price, so the system was probably best for those needs.",

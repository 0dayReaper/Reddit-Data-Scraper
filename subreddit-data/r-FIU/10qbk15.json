The way the program works is   \nthat you\u2019re automatically enrolled when you register for UNDERGRAD   \nclasses. This means that you receive all required textbooks, access   \ncodes and course materials for all your classes at the rate of $20 per   \ncredit hour. If you do the math this will almost always be more   \naffordable that buying your materials on your own, especially if your   \nclasses require digital materials with access codes. If you do NOT wish   \nto participate you have plenty of time to opt out of the program on you   \nmyFIU portal. You do have to revisit this every semester, just the same   \nway that you register every semester. You can learn more about the   \nprogram at https://onestop.fiu.edu/bookpack/.  \n I\u2019m sorry you did not have a positive experience but the intent of the   \nprogram is 100% to save our students money and ensure that everyone has   \naccess to their materials by the first day of class.",

Many people at FIU are unaware of this and are paying for a service they are not using. Due to the large number of emails we receive from FIU and the FIU bookstore, this \"new feature\" got mixed up with other emails. The email itself is not clear at all. It appears to be a spam email asking you to purchase books. For graduate students like me, who only need to take 1-2 undergraduate courses to fulfill certain requirements, paying over $300 when we only need a few books is even worse. My opinion is that any paid service should be 1) offered as an option 2) presented clearly to students with all of the enrollment specifications and terms. Otherwise, it feels like we're being tricked. I'm obviously not the only one that feels this way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSure, for a semester that requires a lot of materials it is a great program to have. But that's why it should be an option to enroll. Not have us enroll automatically.",

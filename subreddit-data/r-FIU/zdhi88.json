Some courses listed 5-6 textbooks and only used one or two.\n\nThis \"book pack\" thing just packages all the listed books for all your courses so you end up paying for a lot that you don't need.",

You might not need to purchase materials for a few classes, but with Panther Book you pay regardless. Also might be dependent on major, I'm in Engineering so I've been able to find most of my textbooks in free PDFs online.",

    "postText": "I'm looking to sublet my private room and bathroom in a 4x4 at 109 tower. Must be currently enrolled FIU student or staff member. The sublet would be available May 1-July 31. The move in date might be able to be earlier as I am moving out April 26. The cost is $925 a month plus electricity. Other roommates are female graduate students. I'm willing to negotiate on the cost of rent as well. Please reach out at [amaci036@fiu.edu](mailto:amaci036@fiu.edu) if interested.",

    "postText": "So i was just wondering if music is allowed in the garages lol \ud83d\ude2d i'm starting to busk with my melodica (no amp or anything) and i was wondering if the garages would be a good place to do it? I'd like the reverb that comes with it, and I dont think ill be bothering many people if im not playing at max volume all the time, since people are usually not staying in the garages for very long. That same fact is also why I want to play in the garages. Theres good \"crowd circulation\", or a good influx of newcomers and a steady departure of people, so it keeps things fresh. I dont know if ill be too annoying though \ud83d\ude29, or if i'm even allowed, so any pointers/knowledge would be helpful, thanks!!!",

I say give it a try, play well enough and something that most people will like to test the water. If they come and kick you out, apologize and ask where would it be ok for you to play on campus. Good luck and look forward to hearing you around!",

If you or anyone knows anything about them or it, lmk because they sound pretty good tbh.",

There is a guy who used to (or still?) bring his music. Besides if you do it where the crazy people go to talk, you will be welcome by many.",

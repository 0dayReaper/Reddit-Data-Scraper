They tend to be office jobs where the max you might have to know is how to work excel at a pretty basic level, and they usually offer (but max out at) 20 hours/week",

The Career Center (Career &amp; Talent Management) jobs are mainly off-campus jobs. I would only go to them for resume critique and mock interviews. Sign up at \u201ccareer.fiu.edu\u201d (no S, since not the same as FIU HR on-campus jobs site)\n\nYou are allowed to work up to 20 hours a week as a student around your class schedule.\n\nWhat\u2019s your major? Maybe you can find one within your academic unit. Talk to your professors to see if they have a student job posted.",

I could not find a job at FIU or Miami for the life of me that offered good pay and good hours. I applied to MULTIPLE jobs and never heard back. the one job I did get was a fancy job on south beach that was on call only, so it was not a good flow of income.\nFIU jobs do not pay well, and they do not respond to most applicants. In order to get hired you really need to find someone who already works at FIU to vouch for you. Most of the jobs pay from 9-15 an hour at the very most, and the job environment is toxic, I know this firsthand because I have a family member who works at FIU and they hate it. \nMiami as a whole does not have jobs with good pay or good hours, and most of the time you will not hear back. \n\nI hope you have a better experience than me, I wish you best of luck, I just thought I\u2019d warn you.",

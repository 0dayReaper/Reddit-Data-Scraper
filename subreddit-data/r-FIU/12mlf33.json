    "postText": "Hello everyone, I\u2019m an admit to FIU and was wondering how bikeable the main campus is so that I can calculate my transportation costs for the year. I don\u2019t live all that far from campus (like, 30 minutes away) so I don\u2019t think my cost for transport will be that big and I won\u2019t have a car for my first year anyway. If y\u2019all could help me out here, that\u2019d be a big help.",

            "comment": "Hi! I bike all over the place around here. It\u2019s tricky but it\u2019s doable. The roads around campus mostly have bike lanes. The roads themselves are pretty dangerous because people drive pretty crazy. My best advice is to bike in the bike lane and then use pedestrian crossings to make turns. \n\nThe big trick is the storms. Sometimes the rain is pretty relentless so you may get stuck places if you aren\u2019t really good with timing, especially in the fall.",

            "comment": "Campus is bike-able. Just be careful of cars; the drivers are at times careless. Since you mentioned that you will be living about 30 mins from campus be very careful. Though some roads heading to campus my offer bike lanes most do not. And there are many car/ bike accidents in South Florida in general. Another concern is the weather. It is not always sunny even if we are the sunshine capital. Any rain storm - light or strong will posse a risk. Happy trails. And congrats to your acceptance to FIU.",

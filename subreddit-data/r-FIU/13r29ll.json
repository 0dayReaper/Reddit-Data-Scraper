    "postText": "I just checked my estimated cost for the year and it came up to 27,890. I put that I am off campus, which is true because I will be paying out of my pocket for that however, why is it included in the estimated cost??? It freaks me out because I feel like I have to pay it directly to FIU. Same thing with the personal expenses and transportation, do I really have to pay for those things directly to FIU other than tuition and book fees?",

            "comment": "I *believe* those are just costs associated with living in Miami, how much they expect you to spend on food, housing (on or off-campus), transportation, and other needs. What applies directly to FIU costs would be the tuition, \"required fees,\" and book costs (if you buy books from them or through panther book pack). Any non-FIU related costs could be more or less based on your situation.\nIf you are unsure about anything, you can call one stop (expect long hold times) or message your academic advisor for clarification.",

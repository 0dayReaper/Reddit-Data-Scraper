You can also contact the [Office of the Ombuds](https://dasa.fiu.edu/all-departments/ombudsperson/) at ombuds@fiu.edu or 305-348-2797 if you need more help.",

That is, students who are allowed extra time on exams or need extreme quiet and can't take them during the regular class period often take all their exams in a place like that. It will probably be located in the school's tutoring center, if there is one.  \n\nIf so, at least one of your professors will probably be willing to allow you to take their exam at that place.  Your professor will need to schedule this in advance with the testing center, so don't wait too long or their slots may fill up.\n\nI'd suggest speaking to your professor(s) about it today, if possible.",

Most professors will make accommodations for scheduling issues outside of a student's control.\n\nEmphasis on \"most.\" Some professors will fail you for an exam even if you're laying in a hospital bed with a gunshot wound lol. That type of professor is few and far between, though, rest assured.",

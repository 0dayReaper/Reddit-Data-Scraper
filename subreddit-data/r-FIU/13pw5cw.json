    "postText": "I was recently accepted to FIU for the Early Fall (I start June 19) but I got their decision May 1st. I applied ASAP for housing because it would be a lot easier commute wise for me. However, I applied for the Fall 2023/Spring 2024 at first and I was 10 and 11 on the waitlist, because for some reason the website wouldn\u2019t allow me to apply for the  Early Fall 2023/Spring 2024. Then fiu housing cancelled my application on May 15th and told me to apply for Early Fall. In a panic I hurried up and applied. I am now 50 and 49 on the waitlist. It is now May 23 and I have not gotten an update. How likely is it that I will get housing?? Please helppp",

I applied for Spring last December and was 11th on the waitlist and then school started so I had to stay at a hotel the first week until I got get an housing in Miami. Even now as a student who applied for fall 23/spring 24 housing I still have not heard anything from the housing department so I had to renew my lease.",

Also its a pre req for other electives so it tends to fill up fast. I'm taking it this semester so no personal experience to speak from\n\nCOP 4710 - Database Admin - Another easy one, from what I've heard\n\nMAD 3105 - Graph Theory - You get to make pretty pictures all day, heard its cake as well :)",

His lectures and exams are mediocre though.\n\nRon Zacharski also gives decent machine learning assignments which I found extremely interesting, and the class is done at your own pace and there are no due dates. You start at a 0 and get points with the more assignments and labs you submit. Also there aren\u2019t any exams. His whole class is also on his github if you wanna take a look at the stuff. https://github.com/zacharski/ml-class",

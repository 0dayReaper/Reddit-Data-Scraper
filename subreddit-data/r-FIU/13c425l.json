    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm a couple semesters from graduating and I'm looking to start the process for a course. I was reading through FIU's policy, which makes it my responsibility to seek an appointment with my access consultant to begin the process and get the substitution approved. The earliest appoint I can find is for next Tuesday. \n\nFor anyone that has done this, did you incur a mark on your transcript for dropping a class? Did you end up enrolling in your replacement late and did you find that to be detrimental? I guess most importantly of all, was the process itself relatively straightforward? Any advice or moral support would be welcome.",

Send them to ALL respective teachers. \n\nBest of luck!",

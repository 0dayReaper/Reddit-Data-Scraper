    "postText": "Anyone know what happens if you get in trouble during a room check ? I already got in trouble before with the FIU Student Honor conduct or whatever because my RA reported me for not checking in guest \ud83d\ude44 which was so annoying because it was a friend who lives on campus and wasn\u2019t even staying over they just came up to my room. Anyways , throughout the school year we have room checks where they don\u2019t even do anything. They simply walk in the room and turn their head left and right and leave. The last room check they came when no one was home, looked through all of our drawers, and even looked through my closet. They ended up finding a recycled candle container where I had literally ONE ROACH of a cbd joint. Not even a full joint it was just the filter.Now I\u2019m waiting for my meeting and I\u2019m super nervous because I have already got in trouble with housing for the guest situation. Also I\u2019m super upset because they never check the rooms properly and because no one is home they went through my personal things and got me in trouble. Also the container was a recycled candle container that I kept in my own plastic drawers so should they even be allowed to open it since they legally cannot open furniture that does not belong to FIU? On top of everything according to my roomates boyfriend who was visiting came home and said they even took pictures of personal Polaroids I took which is extremely weird. To anyone who is dorming GOOD LUCK. They give the RAs a little bit of power and if they decide they don\u2019t like you will bully you and make living on campus a nightmare. pray for me y\u2019all \ud83d\ude22",

Having lived on campus for two years and being the room that hosted parties 2 nights a week minimum they don\u2019t care at all u less you\u2019re vandalizing or doing illegal things even just drinking underage outside your room of your in your room the most they\u2019ll do is noise complaint and tell you all to turn it down or leave depending on how many people called about it",

Who's bad side did you get on? Also they are not supposed to look through your drawers or closet or anything.",

If you have a candle or any type of contraband item they will reschedule a walk through with fiu police to look through and make sure there\u2019s nothing else. They did that to one of my friends who had a candle freshman year. Just move that type of stuff by the day they do the recheck and it should be fine",

Also the container was a recycled candle container. They even went through my roommate's closet and found her bin of liquor. I wasn't home so I don't really know what happened but according to my roommate's boyfriend who came home there were multiple people in the dorm besides the RA's and that they took pictures of my polaroids I had on my desk.",

RA\u2019s have never been known for being strict for any building. Normally during a \u201ccheck\u201d they message the group chat ahead of time and practically walk through with their eyes closed. Your RA sounds like a weirdo",

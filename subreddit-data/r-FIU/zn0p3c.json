    "postText": "so I'm an IT major, and on my flowchart I've always been made aware by this message \"Nine additional credits must be taken from one cognitive area outside SCIS. For example, 9 credits within a minor or certificate meets this requirement \" that i have to take credits outside of my major, the example says from within a minor or certificate course, so that means the courses i have to take don't have to be from a minor/certificate course right? so can i take any 3 courses at fiu? from another major even or not?",

You don\u2019t necessarily have to obtain a minor or certificate though. I major in Computer Science through FIU Online and chose to minor in Economics because I could easily get the minor since I already completed macro. Just needed 3 more courses.",

Basically my CS classes satisfied my EE requirements for my specialty and has the added bonus of the minor.\n\nSo why not minor in Engineering instead.  Sorry of the opposite I did.  Even though my total credit count was 147.",

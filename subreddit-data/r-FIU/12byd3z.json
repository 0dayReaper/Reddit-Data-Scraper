At the opening of the FIU Modesto Maidique Campus in 1972, students began sitting along the pond with their significant other. As time passed, more and more couples began to visit the area around the pond, and it soon became known as the Kissing Pond. It is said that any couple who kisses on the bridge over the hreat-shaped pond will be together for life. Each year, the members of the Student Alumni Association celebrate this tradition by hosting a gathering on the Thursday closest to Valentine's Day.",

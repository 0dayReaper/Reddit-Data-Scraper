    "postText": "Hi there I have an upcoming exam with honorlock and im not sure how it works.. I heard it can detect even phones nearby and flag you, like phones on your Wi-Fi. Overall it sounds super annoying. I've only dealt with lockdown browser and proctorU so far so I'm not sure what to expect and im super nervous.\ud83d\ude13 \n\nWhat is the truth? How does it really work? Do you have to show your room?",

Easy to avoid if you use mobile data or a vpn.\n\nGenerally, do not engage in conduct that would would run afoul of the academic dishonesty policies.

    "postText": "If I'm being totally honest, I feel like the grading system is geared towards getting a lower grade.\n\nFor Example: the overall grade of 82 in some courses translating to a B- which 2.67 on a GPA Scale. 2.67 out of 4.00 shouldn't align with this in any suitable manner.\n\nIt also encourages larger gaps in lower scores i.e squeezing out 5% from 95 to 100 (I've gotten 94 in three courses now) but allowing 70 to 79 to be the domain for a C.",

But in general, I feel like FIU does the opposite, we don't even give out C-'s. It seems like a fair system which is also comparable to other schools in Florida.",

This is true in the entire US university system. For example a professor may set the A to 95 or 94 and then start from there down in each interval, while others may choose to set the A at 90 and higher. The best way to overcome the different scales is to always aim for an A. Of course, it may not be always possible. Yet, you can\u2019t help see students that are getting lots of A and A- are doing way more work and way more studying than others. Of course, the amount of work does not guarantee an A, it does help.",

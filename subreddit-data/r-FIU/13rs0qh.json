    "postText": "Hey, I was wondering if anyone is or knows someone in the same situation. Are there any scholarships or grants you can get with a not approved yet but pending asylum case? I qualify for bright futures, I got it my 2 years at MDC but now I won\u2019t get it because of my legal status, so that\u2019s sucks. That\u2019s why I\u2019m looking for any other applicable scholarship. If anyone knows about anything please lmk.",

Honestly idk why because if the scholarship gives the funds why wouldn\u2019t they receive it. They are not the ones putting the money.",

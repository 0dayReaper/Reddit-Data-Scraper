If you want to change it, there\u2019s a form on fiu.edu you can fill out to update your entry term but you\u2019ll need to explain why you want to change and they\u2019ll need to approve it since fall has a different admission criteria than summer. I know that because I called and asked for myself :)",

Usually that\u2019s why people are accepted into summer term but this may not be your case. To verify, I would call Fiu one stop and they would tell you a response better suited for your situation. Their number is 3053487000 and they answer Monday through Friday 9-6.",

Hopefully this will assist for consideration to start during the Fall Term. From what I understand one may need to decline the Summer Term acceptance and reapply for the Fall Term. And at this point in time be pushed for the Spring Term. And this would shift the cadence of the Honors curriculum. Finger-Crossed. I will be calling tomorrow.",

My high school school doesn\u2019t rank because of its competitiveness, my weighted GPA is a 92.92 so about a 3.7-3.8 gpa on a 4.0 scale, I got a 1060 on my SAT, I have about a 95% cumulative average\u2026 I failed algebra two my second term but maintained A\u2019s in all my other classes, I thought that one grade for that term would set me back because a lot of colleges want four years of math and also two years of a language. I only took Spanish my freshman year because New York only requires a year to meet graduation requirements. but a lot of colleges accepted me .. I guess because I showed consistency in all of my other subjects, I just had a bad year during my junior year for math. To make up for the missing credit, I\u2019m taking web development this year which is a computer science class and it\u2019s really great. I also took extra enrichment classes just for fun in science and English.",

            "comment": "Well I know BSC 2010 is biology 1 and gly 1010 is geology. It mostly depends on what you prefer to take and also what your major is. Is this one of the university requirements for you? I personally believe biology 1 would be easier than geology if you have no interests in either course but it would require lots of memorization. Lots of students like Thomas Pitzer as a Biology 1 professor. I loved taking John Cozza as a Biology 1 professor. The lab for biology 1 is fairly easy as well. I personally don\u2019t know much of geology but it\u2019d be more about rocks and stuff of that matter. Biology 1 is more about the cell and things at that scale. Depends mostly on what you\u2019d like to learn if you have both options.",

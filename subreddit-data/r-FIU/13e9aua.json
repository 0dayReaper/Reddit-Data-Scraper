    "postText": "Hello, i am 99% sure i want to apply to FIU for Electrical Engineering. I graduated with a bachelors degree in poly sci in 2018 and a MBA in 2022. Hopefully i can get some answers here.\n1. When transferring credits, can i use applicable credits from both my masters and bachelors or just the bachelors?\n\n2. Did anyone take calc 1 to get in and how was that class?\n\n3. What is the workload like? Trying to determine how many classes i should take a semester (was told online can take up to 4 a semester) \n\n\nAll Answers and anything thing you guys could think of would be appreciated. Thanks",

I'm currently almost finished with the Online BSEE program. \n\n- I don't think they would accept graduate credits but I'm not 100%.\n- I took all Calc classes at a community college before transferring, Calc 1 wasn't bad (but that's very subjective)\n- I generally take 3 courses per semester. I work full time (shift work) and have kids so that's about all I can handle.\n\nIf you need anything else, let me know. You'll definitely want to talk to admissions for the official answers.\n\nThis was all they've posted on Accreditation. That it falls under the in person accreditation. I heard that the evaluation happened so I would think info would come out this year. \n[Accreditation](https://i.imgur.com/dEIlwFJ.jpg)",

He got back to me saying the program was accredited, but I'm not altogether sure he really understood that I was talking about the online program specifically.  I know in the past it has come under the accreditation \"umbrella\" of the face-to-face program, but supposedly they were going to do an accreditation review of the online program as a solo entity this past year.\n\nSo I think the answer is probably yes, but, speaking personally, I'm going to contact admissions by phone and triple-check this before I apply to transfer in.",

Strongly considering FIU, but definitely need to know about accreditation.  If the answer really is yes, I kind of wonder why they haven't put it on their website, since a lot of people must have that question.\n\nOTOH, lots of places don't keep their websites up to date.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's an ABET website that maintains a list of accredited programs, isn't there?  That might be a better place to check, anyway.",

If so, I'd suggest you go there for your math and the other lower-division engineering pre-reqs (e.g. Physics 1 and 2), and wait to transfer in to FIU's program until you've done all that.  The CC will be less expensive, and the quality of instruction may well be better.  (That's not a slam on FIU; I'd say the same thing about any university.  CC instructors are teaching specialists and don't generally split their effort between teaching and research the way university professors do, and if you need individual help, it's often easier to get it at a CC.)\n\nWRT graduate credits, I can't speak for FIU, but I believe its common for colleges not to accept graduate courses in place of undergraduate ones.  I had that exact problem over a course I'd taken in technical writing while in grad school in another field.  The college whose engineering program I was transferring into wouldn't accept it in place of their own 2000-level technical-writing course, and my point that the course I'd taken in grad school was probably more in-depth and challenging than their undergraduate course didn't go down well with them.  :-)  But other than technical writing and maybe something like project management, it doesn't seem like there'd be much overlap between your MBA work and what you'll be doing at FIU, so it may be a moot point.",

Just keep up with the work, take advantage of the CC's math lab, tutoring center, or whatever they call it if you need it, and you'll be fine.  Putting in the work and the time on a consistent basis is key, and you know you have that kind of work ethic or you'd never have finished your MBA.\n\nOh, you may find that it's better to take the entire Calculus sequence, all 3 courses, at the same school.  Sometimes different colleges split the material up or arrange it differently, so if you switch schools in the middle of the sequence, you could end up either skipping some topic(s) entirely, covering some twice, and/or finding that you're missing something you need to know for a current course that your new school--but not your last one--covered in a previous course.\n\nI wish you every success!",

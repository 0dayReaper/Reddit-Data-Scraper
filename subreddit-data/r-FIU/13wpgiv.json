    "postText": "i\u2019m an FIU online student that just transferred for the summer semester. I\u2019ve submitted all documents and payed all deposits already so i resolved every hold in my account. The only hold i have is one that\u2019s called complete orientation. i\u2019m just confused because i already completed the virtual orientation so i\u2019m not sure how else to remove the hold. I\u2019ve been trying to get in contact with my assigned advisor but it\u2019s quite literally impossible. i\u2019ve been trying to reach them for a week at this point. If someone on here could help me, it would be really great.",

After you complete the virtual orientation go to your FIU student homepage (My FIU) and click on \"Orientation\", here you will be able to select which orientation you would like to attend and it will be either in person or via Zoom. I selected the Zoom orientation for June 19th.",

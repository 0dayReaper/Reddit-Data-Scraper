    "postText": "Hi. I am a student at FIU and also I am a realtor. I have a database of online leads from potential buyers/sellers that need to be followed up on. I need a motivated Inside Sales agent to reach out to the leads through phone, email and text. This is a short term project and you will be paid as a Independent Contractor. Pay is $17/hr. Please reach out to me if you have great customer service and sales skills. You do not have to be licensed as a Realtor to make the calls. \n\nThanks- Aaron Hill Jr PA- United Realty Group- Plantation FL.",

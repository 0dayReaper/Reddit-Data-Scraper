    "postText": "I'm trying to enroll for Fall 2023 and it's giving me trouble. \n\nI need EEL 3110C, and EEL 3120, which both have PHY 2049 as a prerequisite, and MAP 2302 as a corequisite. I'm currently in PHY 2049, and I'm enrolled in MAP 2302 for Summer 2023. When I try to enroll for Fall though, it tells me the requisites haven't been met.\n\nIs this because I haven't finished PHY 2049 yet? I'm pretty sure I've enrolled in classes before while I'm still finishing the prerequisite, but I don't know. I've got an advising appointment but not for a week or so and I don't want the classes the fill up.\n\nAny help is appreciated!",

            "comment": "Just a random thought, but is there any chance you could go to the registrar's office and get them to flip whatever flag needs flipping there rather than going through your advisor?  That would save you waiting for an appointment with your advisor.\n\nGenerally speaking, the smaller the school, the more likely you'll be able to do this.  Larger schools tend to be more rigid about procedures.  FIU's fairly big, but I figure it never hurts to ask.",

You don't have ti set an appointment and their reply can just be the usual I have placed you in it of you fail the pre reqs u get dropped.\n\nI'm a CEC student and emailed my advisor many times about this. I was a CE major not sure if your advisor is different but I can tell u the advisor I emailed and she had a great response time.",

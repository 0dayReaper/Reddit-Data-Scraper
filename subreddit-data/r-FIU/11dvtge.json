I was wondering if any of you were familiar with the process of getting recruited and contacting coaches (I\u2019m out of state) and if anyone knows any athletes that might be able to speak to the quality of the program\u2026 or if anyone can speak to the quality of FIU athletics in general? \n\nAny and all help is much appreciated, thank you!",

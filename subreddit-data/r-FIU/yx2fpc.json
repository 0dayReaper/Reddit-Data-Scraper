    "postText": "I just finished speaking to someone in the department about this but I am here to double check that this is correct but, anyone that is in the BFA and transferred with an Associates, did you pass the 60 credit limit? I will be graduating with both an AA and AS  in Graphic Design. (One is more occupational courses that prepare you for the workforce, and the other is for transfer.) I'll be leaving MDC with around 86 credits. Would I still be eligible for the BFA in Graphic Design?",

Though all your courses will stay on your academic record, FIU will only \"count\" the 60 that best apply to your degree to avoid excess credit charges. \n\nIf you have the prerequisites completed (Drawing, 2D, 3D, figure drawing, and the Art Histories) you won't have an issue. \n\nIf you don't have the prerequisites, you'll have to do those on top of the upper division requirements.",

    "postText": "I'm making this post as a call for alumni to the program I'm interested in as well as others at FIU. I'm currently trying to decide between Rutgers MA in Criminal Justice and FIU (Florida International University) MASc in Criminal Justice. I'll start talking about me then about what each program has.\n\nFirstly, I'm a Canadian student with a Honours BA in Criminology with a GPA of 3.0. I qualify for both programs no problem. I'm looking for a university which is somewhat prestigious in their program. If they are somewhat prestigious then the program ought to be somewhat good. By that I mean they cover many aspects about criminology and other intersecting fields, gender, sex, race, oppression, disability, drugs, age, policing, etc. I want a program which challenges me to further my academic ability as well as providing a foundation for me to write, publish, or at least advocate. I want to make the most out of my education with either a specialization and/or certificates I can obtain at the same time. This lead me to Rutgers and FIU as they both somewhat match what I'm looking for. I'm looking to further a career in working with, in, or outside the government. Policy analyst is probably the best career which encompasses what I want to do. Something with a liveable wage that helps to work on bettering society as a whole or works with people to help them navigate society. Depending on how well I do, I may also go for a Ph. D.\n\nFIU offers a Masters of Science in Criminal Justice, where you can concurrently obtain a teaching certificate, a national security certificate or you can take an internship. In terms of core courses, you take a basic criminological theories, national security course, data analysis, policy analysis, and research methods. The course electives aren't bad like death penalties, geospatial crime analysis, or biosocial criminology. Those are of interest and are somewhat unique. It's a total of 36 credits (12 courses). FIU seems to focus it's criminal justice on practical and real world themes but touch on some theory. For example a course like cold case investigation is for practical while a victimology course is somewhat of a theoretical course. I feel as though, because it's \"Florida\" it's not taken seriously or to the same degree as other universities or states. My fear is that FIU is not serious and critical enough. Like a course like law and social control, looking at the laws effectiveness of controlling criminal behaviour. But what about looking deeper and being critical of \"Why is something deemed criminal? Why do we attempt to control behaviour in such a way?\" [Here's a course catalog I'm using](http://catalog.fiu.edu/2020_2021/graduate/Steven_J_Green_School_of_International_and_Public_Affairs/GD_Criminology_and_Criminal_Justice.pdf)\n\nRutgers hasn't really advertised to me any certificates I can take at the same time of doing my MA. They have a portion of the same core courses, data analysis, policy analysis and research methods. Rutgers also offers some interesting courses like psychopathology or sex discrimination. It's a total of 30 credits (10 courses). Rutgers as a whole seems to focus more on the social theory aspect of criminal justice as well as intersecting studies. Like psychopathology or human behaviour and environment which touch on sociology and psychology. They do cover a wide range of things like white collar, labour, financial, gender and crime, or law and society. I think they do hit on those points like justice reform or being critical of policing. [Here are the courses](https://sociology.camden.rutgers.edu/graduate-program-criminal-justice/graduate-program-courses/)\n\nHere are my questions and things I need to know for both universities\n\n* Is CRT censored at the university? Can I mention it in my letter of intent? Can I write about it in classes? Will it be taught in classes? Can I advocate for it without some form of dismissal or consequence from the university?\n* What are discussions like social welfarism or gender, race, and sexual orientation like? Do they talk about these things in an unbiased way?\n* What are the courses like? Is it hard? Do they really make you critical think and analysis things? Do they challenge you to reframe your thinking?\n* Is this a program that is forward thinking? By that I mean, is the university trying to strive and provide their students with the ability to further academic knowledge? Or are they just trying to educate people and be done with it?\n* Is the program and faculty critical? Are they willing to teach or push ideas that are against the norm?\n* What is the difference between a Masters of Science and a Masters of Art? Both universities require the same courses in terms of statistics for the degree. So why is one a MA and the other is a MASc\n* I'd like to think of myself as striving to be an advocate, if I'm advocating for something like trans rights, abortion care, or systematic discrimination am I going to be seen as an advocate or a liability to the university?\n* Knowing what I'm looking for in a university, which one do you think is best?\n\nIn conclusion, I can't decide right now which university suits my aspirations and is best for me. Hence why I am calling for more information from those who really do know what it's like in Florida or Rutgers. Currently, I lean towards FIU for their program as I can get a MASc (I see it as better and more competent) and possibly a certificate as well with the option of an internship. They do have courses which touch on topics of sociology, criminology, and psychology which are what I'm interested in, but I don't know if they dive into it and are as critical as I want to go. I also miss the palm trees. Meanwhile Rutgers is closer to home, it is in a more liberal state which makes me less worried about certain topics. Rutgers is also a lot more well known than FIU which gives me confidence in their competency. I'm taking my time to choose and decide but I need to know more information before I can make the choice.\n\nTL;DR: I need a university which will really challenges me and see criminal justice as a social science for change. I do not want to be limited by some bigoted ideology regarding sex, gender, and CRT. I want a  jampacked education which will facilitate my aspirations for a better society. Which one has the juicer education?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and any advice or recommendations you give!",

As my experience in some of the areas they are mentioning is limittted.\n\nHowever, as someone who completed the MS in CJ at FIU, and  currently working on my PhD in International Crime and Jusrtice, the university, program, and resources are amazing. From my experience, my areas of focus and studies have not been limited over the past 7 years. Yet, that might change  based on state administration.\n\nCRT is not taught as part of the core courses, however, you are welcomed to bring it up in class discussions. We have excellent faculty who focus on a  large variety of research topics and are active on research. Check out the CJ faculty page, it is regularly updated and you can also check out publications and work by currently students. We have a few Rutgers and FSU alumni among the faculty.",

Go to Rutgers.\n\nThe situation in Florida has the governor directly meddling in the affairs of universities specifically where any discussion of race or social justice is concerned. If you want to have an open academic environment where you can speak your mind and have professors who can engage with the topics you are interested in without fearing for their jobs go elsewhere.\n\nDo not come to Florida.\n\nThis is something I say as an FIU student, and as a person who is on the next version of this states program for elimination of diverse thought and backgrounds. Get your education in another state. Do not contribute your money or your time to this school or this state.\n\nSome may indicate that they do not feel currently oppressed by the climate in the school. This may be the case, but one should expect that over the next year as the contest for the republican presidential nomination heats up, the situation may change suddenly and drastically. The governor is already making drastic and unconstitutional moves in education and other areas in his bid for national recognition. It is unlikely that the his desperation and vindictiveness will decrease over time given the evidence of the past few years in Florida.\n\nYou will be committing large amounts of your time and money for a degree. Don\u2019t spend all that only to be stuck under a climate of fear and paranoia.",

FIU is not a very well known school outside of Miami. But Rutgers and FSU are. \n\nGet your degree from a well-known university to increase the ethos of your future arguments. If it becomes a problem, fight the good fight somewhere else. There\u2019s plenty of other states that would love to have someone with nationally recognizable credentials. \n\nBetter yet, and I may be a bit biased here as a recent law school graduate, get a law degree and practice in the states. There are so many novel issues to tackle in the courts and I think someone with your passion would make an incredible advocate for those in need.",

I will be honest, no college is going to challenge you as much as you will challenge yourself to learn new things. Considering the opinions you provided in your statement, the biggest challenge you can undertake is to go to a university you think is \"*limited by some bigoted ideology regarding sex, gender, and CRT*\", and as an MA, Rutgers is just going to just give you what you want, and who wants to be told something you already know? I would say that there would be no challenge, but alas, that is up to you to decide.   \n\n\nThat said, I am going to be honest with you and I mean this with all the love in the world I can give to a stranger, I think you already picked Rutgers. It is comfortable for you, and it is close to home. However, if you truly believe in all the opinions you provided above, I challenge you to go to FIU. We have one of the top passing law schools in the state and if you think there is a lot of bigoted ideology in the state, what better way to challenge the status quo than by working towards something you believe in, especially in a place you feel is limited by bigoted ideologies. The choice is yours and good luck! Regardless of the choice, you got this!",

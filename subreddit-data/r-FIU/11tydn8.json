    "postText": "I transferred from community college this spring and so far my experience at FIU has been significantly worse. Professors opting out of honorlock to do exams with a hundred students in one zoom call, giant holes between the material covered and what's on the exams, and computer science classes being nothing but mountains of Google search busy work with zero lectures or learning material. I feel like I'm doing a lot of work but learning very little. Is this just how FIU is or am I just having a bad semester? My friend who is a few semesters ahead of me says it's about the same but I'd like other perspectives.",

            "comment": "I transferred from BC not too long ago, and your experience is what I dealt with during the pandemic. A lot of material was not covered, I believe professors were adapting to teaching remotely as we students were adapting learning everything online. It was chaos, but last fall and this spring semester has been a 180 compared to that. I actually switched from computer engineering to biomedical engineering, I will say the computer engineering department had a handful of misses with professors compared to my current major. Overall, my professors have been wonderful this year compared to when I first started out. \n\nStill, STEM majors require TONS of self-teaching and discipline since these classes tend to be larger than CC. This absolutely tests your time management and ability to grasp such concepts mostly on your own. Study in groups if you can and attend tutor/LA sessions, they're crucial especially once you get to your upper division courses. \n\n[https://opir.fiu.edu/faculty-evaluations.htm](https://opir.fiu.edu/faculty-evaluations.htm). These are faculty evaluations accessible to all FIU students, more reliable than RMP I feel. I hope these can help you pick out professors in your next semester, best of luck! If you have any questions, PM me and I'll be more than happy to help.",

I\u2019ve never had a professor do that really, in fact most try to limit the amount you can use google for projects, attempting to teach requisite concepts themselves.

A lot of these so call professors are not really lecturer but in fact researcher who are on payroll so they need to \"teach\" classes as well. And usually just end up reading off a powerpoint and letting TA's lead the course.\n\nIn community college, most professors are dealing with smaller classes and are doing a lot of their lecturing part time. So they are intrinsically teaching you other than doing it because they have to. That said, there are some hidden gems out there. It all depends.\n\nYou are taking online classes from the context of your post. Online classes are typically very low effort for students and professors. Try in person classes for the best experience",

There is no such thing as a lecturer as when you get your phd, you only learn about research or 90% about research. If you go the Chronicle of higher education, there is an article calling for phds to offer pedagogy. \n\nCommunity college professors only teach. So they can take all the time on doing this one job. \n\nWhat\u2019s the difference ? In liberal arts schools, some private universities, community colleagues, and a few exceptions in state schools, the pressure to bring funding in state R1 and some private unos over takes the time of the professors. So what would you do to make them teach better? You place them in junior, senior, and grad courses (which are easier to teach) in their area. Then you have teaching professors teach the rest. FIU has been doing this in CS but they still need to improve it. Maybe the new chair will once they a new one (if ??). Professors at state universities, like myself, really care about teaching and we our best. I love doing it even most of time goes in research, which I love. I think most professors get better over time and when they invest more time.  Yet, it is true that you may find a few ones that don\u2019t want to teach.  But in cs, this is not a problem since they can work in research national labs, govt research, non profit, and research industry, among others. Now, I think the department shows it\u2019s commitment to teaching by their policies.",

Moving from a community college to an R1 state university is a huge adjustment. I\u2019m not sure if you went to MDC, but MDC\u2019s mission is to teach and provide as many resources as possible. A state university, that is fairly new as R1, it is priority is research. Of course, it is my hope that the new chair brings a balance between the two. Your professors, assistant professors in particular, have to do at least 50 hours of research to hope to make it to the next stage. Of course, the education of students should also be equally important but the balance must be found by the administration. It is a hard balance. I have ideas how this can improve but neither I work there now, nor Im administration to make these changes. So that is a huge difference. \n\n2. Ideally, all professors will provide a learning path that works for you. They are not teachers but professors. If you had gone to a private university with smaller class sizes, or a liberal arts college, you would get  a higher priority in terms of the learning experience. \n\n3. Like in life, there are good professors and bad professors. And this is rather subjective. Some people may find Prof X the best but you may find Prox X the worst. Professors may be training you for something that the professor may have not verbalized but still useful. Even passing bad professors is part of the experience. \n\n4. In CS, being independent, doing outside CS projects (either for free or paid) is paramount. You will not learn enough. \n\nI\u2019m very curious which professor is asking you to search and which class is this? There may be something behind, as opposed thinking that you have a lazy professor or instructor. Of course, maybe they are. \n\nI\u2019m happy to chat further in this thread.",

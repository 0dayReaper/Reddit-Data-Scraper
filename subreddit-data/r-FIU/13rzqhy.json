(The one by the fair) campus and where they may be located-\n\nUnderstandably, this may strike some as an odd question, though I want to remind that MDC had gender neutral restrooms across their campuses and I figure this would be useful information for anyone else that has any concerns about the new legislation and what bathrooms they are allowed to use\n\nAny info is helpful (and if FIU is anything like MDC, there are different campuses and those listings would be appreciated too)",

    "postText": "As the title says, I just got accepted to the MSIRE program. However, I went to UF for my undergrad so I am not all that familiar with FIU and wanted the perspective of people who go here.\n\nThe total cost of the program is $28,000, which is somewhat expensive compared to my alternative of an MBA at FGCU for $12,000. Does FIU offer enough to justify the additional cost? I understand the MSIRE program is highly regarded, but what have you heard about it?\n\nThanks in advance, I am excited to be given this opportunity, it's just a lot of money and a big decision. I have two weeks before the tuition deposit is required.",

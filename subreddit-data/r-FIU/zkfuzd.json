    "postText": "I am currently a UF student, and due to personal circumstances, I had to leave Gainesville at the end of the fall semester. I am a Sustainability studies major at UF and want to continue pursuing that while finalizing what industry I want to use that specialization for. I am looking into hospitality/tourism/event management. UF online does not offer sustainability studies online, but it provides hospitality management. Whereas FIU online offers sustainability studies, the built environment, and global sustainable tourism online. If i choose to transfer to FIU, I will double major. (if someone is taking one of these major please let me know how you like it. )\n\nThis is where this might get confusing; please bear with me. If I choose UF online, I could take classes offered online to get a sustainability minor( i only need 6-7 credits left) while also taking some hospitality classes. (the other 6-7 credits) I could apply for UF online for the hospitality management (drop my current major) major in the summer, and when I finish, I can declare my sustainability minor with it. I found out that USF offers a graduate certificate for sustainable tourism if I want to do that.\n\nI applied to FIU online for the spring, and I will not be accepted because they want to see my final transcript(the due date was December 7th), and exam season hasn't finished, so that sucks. They probably think I flunked at UF, which I did not.  So in this instance, I would have to take a gap semester or continue being a UF student for the spring with classes offered online. Still, it seems like a waste of money and time since the hospitality classes at UF compared to the global sustainable tourism classes are very different, so they are not equivalent.\n\nThese majors at FIU seem more interesting, and the school seems to be better in the sustainability department than UF. Someone can tell me if they think differently. I don't want to stick with UF simply for the prestige aspect of it, even though I feel pressured to do so. So yeah, I know I didn't ask a question, so it's simply advice ...sorry for it being so long; I keep going back and forth in my head.\n\nALSO I HAVE ONLY ATTENDED UF FOR ONE SEMESTER, I GOT MY AA AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE",

More importantly, unless there\u2019s other external factors (scholarship running out, etc) there\u2019s nothing wrong with taking a gap semester.",

So I would be okay if I didn't start school again until  fall 2023. I would start again in the summer and just pay for it out of pocket(they only send checks during fall and spring semester) it. I really was intrigued by the global sustainable tourism degree that FIU offered...I think I'm just feeling the pressure of not finishing college when I was supposed to finish and also that I would be leaving UF. I was judged when people found out that I would be possible attending FIU and I try not to let it get in my head. I did really well in the school academically, but external factors led to me having to leave.",

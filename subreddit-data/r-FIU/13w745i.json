When the building opened and I leased for the first year my rent was 1450, and that was INSANE considering that apartment wasn\u2019t even more than 350 sq ft.\n\nWhat a goddamn travesty this city has become. My mortgage on a 2/2 900+ sq ft condo is nearly 600 dollars cheaper.",

I\u2019ve lived here my entire life, but the cost increases in the past literally 3 years have been unprecedented to a degree I don\u2019t even think I could\u2019ve fathomed in undergrad.\n\nTo clarify for anyone else, 1900 for the quality of TheOne is a \u201cgood deal\u201d even if the room is the size of a tiny hotel suite. Other far shittier apartments go for similar prices and are way worse location and amenities wise.",

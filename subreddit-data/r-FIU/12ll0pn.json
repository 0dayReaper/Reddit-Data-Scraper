They\u2019re guilty of the same level of authoritarianism that they\u2019ll happily acknowledge in Democrats.",

If you aren\u2019t you will face charges.\n\nThe same cannot be said for people with zero accountability that want to hump like degenerate bunnies and get unexpectedly pregnant. There\u2019s no charge for that equivalent to being a criminal with a gun.",

If that is your perspective, then that is a rather authoritarian point of view. May I suggest not worrying about others and worrying more on yourself.",

I\u2019ve heard more abortion stories from women who required one because they were carrying a dead baby and were on the verge of death themselves than women who got one because they \u201cwant to hump like degenerate bunnies.\u201d",

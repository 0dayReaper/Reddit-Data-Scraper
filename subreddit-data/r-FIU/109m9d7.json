    "postText": "I applied to marketing at both of these schools and I am currently weighing my options. To clarify, I am based in Miami which is a great factor. One, I was wondering which school had the higher quality marketing school. Second, if UCF were to have better marketing education than FIU, is it worth the extra money that I would be spending on room and board that I wouldn't have to spend if going to FIU?",

Both have the same curriculum, both have the same accreditation &amp; you can look up the faculty online to see if someone looks more interesting. \n\nSomeone is going to say \u201cUCF\u201d but will be basing it on nothing relevant, both schools are emerging preeminent in Florida. One is a little older &amp; has more Greek life &amp; sports. The industry will focus on tourism, some tech.\n\nFIU has more of a focus on global learning, international education &amp; has a good soccer team. The industry will focus on tourism (cruise lines not theme parks), some tech.\n\nOn the plus side, FIU has David Grutman teaching a class so there\u2019s that &amp; your experience can include the South Beach Food &amp; Wine Festival.",

            "comment": "I go to FIU so I am partly biased since I have a general grasp of the school.\n\nSince you\u2019re based in Miami, the best option would most likely be FIU. Unless UCF and Orlando have certain supplemental clubs/programs that you\u2019re highly interested in (or you want to leave your hometown and have a college experience, no shame in that), I wouldn\u2019t go paying the room and board for an education that isn\u2019t all too different.\n\nLook, an education is an education. Whether from FIU, UCF or Yale, at the end you will have your degree, telling every employer or connection that you are qualified to do marketing.\n\nWhat FIU will give you that you may not find easily at UCF is freedom. The workloads aren\u2019t overly intense, and you might be able to do practically all of your classes online, freeing you up to get work experience. That work experience is what\u2019s going to set you apart from any other marketing student fresh out of college. Moving to UCF would make this a bit more difficult, since you\u2019re staying at the college, you\u2019re probably going to spend a great deal of time at it, etc etc. \n\nTake advantage that you\u2019re studying in your hometown, and rack up your work experience while in Miami. Miami\u2019s an affluent city that\u2019s packed with big companies and startups looking for a way to get the most eyes on their product. You\u2019ll be surprised at the connections you can make here.",

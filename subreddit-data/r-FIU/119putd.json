    "postText": "Hey guys and congrats to all those graduated! \nI'm currently in my last semester here at FIU and with graduation coming up quickly I have some questions. For my cap, gown &amp; cords, I would purchase that directly through the Herff Jones website then pick them up at the C-fair right? Also, I'm seeing the \"Achievement Stole\" on the HJ website and also wanted to ask about that... is that required? Andd would we need any requirements to buy it? \n\n+ any other tips are heavily appreciated!",

It\u2019s not supposed to be worn by the graduate, but by someone who the graduate believes supported them throughout their college career. Despite that, many graduates still wear it, either because they didn\u2019t read the instructions included with the stole or because they were their own support system. Regardless, FIU doesn\u2019t care who wears it.\n\nReally it\u2019s just an extra item in the grad packages and it\u2019s not required nor are there any extra requirements needed to obtain it. Congrats on almost graduating. Cheers.",

Any thoughts/ideas are extremely appreciated. I\u2019ve never been to Miami but will be visiting in February so hopefully that will help me get a better sense of the Miami layout as well. Thanks in advanced!",

You can find something down in homestead for probably cheaper than anywhere else, but it\u2019s like a 30+ minute commute easily.\n\nIf you are not gonna have a car, you\u2019re gonna wanna be walking distance to FIU. There may be some houses nearby which are rented out to students by the room, which would likely be your cheapest option. Important to know that public transit is nonexistent here.",

Just trying to do the mental math of if the gas &amp; cheaper rent will be better than walking &amp; higher rent. Thank you so much for your response- I will be sure to check out homestead",

My roommates barely use the kitchen so I can use it and cook. One thing tho is they don't ever clean the apartment. I'm the one who clean. And 4th street is the cheapest out of all the other buildings. But I'm very curious how it is living on campus and if it's worth to switch.",

You're forced to pay a year-round lease which isn't worth it (~5k more) if you go home when the Spring semester ends (April 29th)!\n\nOn-campus leases aren't year round but Fall/Spring and Summer specific (respectively). Cheaper.",

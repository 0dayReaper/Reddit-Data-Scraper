Some of them will evaluate your application based on a pdf of unofficial transcripts that you upload, and then you\u2019ll have to send official transcripts once you\u2019re accepted. Other schools need a paper copy mailed to them direct from the registrar. Check wherever you\u2019re applying. Good luck!",

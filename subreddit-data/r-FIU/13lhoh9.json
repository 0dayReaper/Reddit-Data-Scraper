    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m an international Pakistani student, (rising junior) at the University of Scranton and I\u2019m looking for a room for the months of June and July, possibly close to the Main Campus. I\u2019m not a resident of Florida and I\u2019ve got a research opportunity that will keep me in Miami for the summer! I\u2019m not looking for anything pricey, something within 500 to 600 dollars per month would be amazing! If anyone has any leads, please do let me know, time is of the essence and I would like to have a solid plan by next week at least.",

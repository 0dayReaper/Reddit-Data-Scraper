    "postText": "So I just wanted to make a post regarding this major offered asynchronously online at FIU as I finish up my degree for any others who might be interested in this program. I started this program from a two year transfer program. \n\n1. Admissions process - This was very easy as all I needed to do was send my transcripts from high school and community college into admissions. The application fee was about $200 which goes towards your first semester if you are admitted. The hardest part of this was determining which credits would be accepted or not. There are online resources available (will edit and add later) that list common credits accepted from certain schools. However for ones that aren\u2019t listed you will have to provide a syllabus for the course that includes the class schedule which can be pretty hard to acquire if not saved on canvas/blackboard. If you reach out to your school with the semester, year and professor they should be able to help you with that. Once that\u2019s completed they will tell you what classes you will need to take/retake if not accepted and what credits will be transferred. Most likely not all credits will transfer so please be prepared to start a semester back. \n\n2. Classes - Once the you have been admitted a counselor will schedule a meeting with you to talk about your next classes that need to be taken. The necessary math classes are calc 1 and 2, multi-variable calculus, linear algebra/ linear systems and differential equations. These drive your schedule as they are all pre-reps for classes such as circuits or signals. Courses are available by priority and summer classes are the hardest to get so make sure to register as soon as possible and have back up classes when possible. \n\nThe classes don\u2019t require you to attend lectures but be aware that exam dates are finite. I\u2019ve had exams scheduled at 9 am Saturday and 2pm Wednesday so it just depends on the professor but make sure to schedule around these dates as soon as you receive the syllabus. The hardest part about the classes is towards senior year (concentration classes) as class space is limited and certain classes are only offered in person. Most of the classes offered for fully online are computer/programming oriented so coding is essential.\n\n3. Equipment - FIU offers a panther book pack that often times comes with all the equipment needed for labs, simulations, studying etc. However for certain classes the equipment is only available for rent by FIU and must be picked up in person using your panther ID. If you can\u2019t pick them up in person then you\u2019ll have to buy them which can get pretty pricey.\n\n4. Groups - majority of your non-math classes with be lab/ project oriented with group work so it\u2019s paramount you develop coordination and time management skills. Almost every group I\u2019ve been in thus far has had issues with someone dropping the course halfway, not responding, or doing the work incorrectly so be prepared to pick up slack.\n\nWill continue to edit more but if any particular questions, comments or suggestions please feel free to share.",

                    "comment": "I had a pretty mediocre high school transcript and my transfer transcript was maybe a 3.2 average at best. But I do think the acceptance process for online and in person are the same. FIU has an 86% acceptance rate so honestly as long as you didn\u2019t flunk out you should be pretty good.\n\nOfcourse without more context it\u2019s hard for me to give proper advice but I do think it\u2019s worth the chance to take the risk. $200 is basically a drop in the bucket compared to what you\u2019ll pay in tuition and books so I would say bet on yourself if you can afford to lose the money. Any money spent on education or self improvement is never a waste.",

If your goal is to do RF design or communications online is not the best option for you as those are only offered in person. \n\nEven the ones like telecommunications only offer 3/4 classes offered in person. This is a fairly new program so that could change with time but I would look up the concentrations offered online compared to what job you\u2019d like to do. Unfortunately the concentrations that are offered online are all over the place from programming to biomedical to cyber security so you\u2019re not really going to master one concentration but rather be a jack of all.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to just get the degree of transfer to fully in person than I think it\u2019s a great option but if you plan to go in robotics for example then there aren\u2019t going to be many classes you can take that pertain to that.",

You could also split the costs with your group or rent them from a 3rd party but you might not want to trust renting them.\n\nAs far as the courses go none of them will require you to be on campus, many professors have office hours on zoom or you can always schedule an appointment. All the exams are proctored through honorlock and most group members prefer meeting online anyhow.",

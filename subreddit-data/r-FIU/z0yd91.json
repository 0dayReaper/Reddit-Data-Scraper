    "postText": "I'm an FIU Online student and I'm getting ready to register for courses. I have a question for anyone who's taken dedicated online classes(not temporarily online education due to COVID) at FIU. \n\nI notice there are online sections labelled \"Online\" and \"Online Live\". For \"Online Live\" sections, is attending the live video lectures mandatory? Or is it optional? Do they still give you all the educational content(recorded lecture, PowerPoints, etc.) that all the \"Online\" sections would get?\n\nThanks",

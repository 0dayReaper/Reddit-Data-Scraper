    "postText": "Hi, so I recently graduated with my degree in English from FIU. I was admitted to FIU\u2019s graduate program in Global Strategic Communications on the Creative/Art Direction track in collaboration with the Miami Ad School. However, I am also looking into University of Southern California\u2019s Communication Management program. My ultimate goal is to work as a creative director/executive in the Film/TV industry. I\u2019m also a FL resident who qualifies for in-state tuition at FIU, but I\u2019ve always wanted to attend USC. Which program is better in your opinion?",

Only reason I can think of going to USC that you seem to want to work in Hollywood and USC is in L.A. \n\nStill not a good enough reason to pay oos tuition to go to USC. Most creatives directors start off as writers and I'm sure most writes didn't all go to school in the L.A area. \n\nAs far as executives, most of them are straight business guys. If you want to do that, write to get some writing jobs and work on a business degree.",

Your professors at USC will be some of the titans in that industry. Look at this through that lens rather than \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to go to USC.\u201d What will choosing USC do for you over staying at FIU? The choice is obvious to me\u2026but I\u2019m not you and you\u2019ve got to make sure whatever school you choose is going to help move you along your path. Fight On!",

    "postText": "I'ma c4s student transferring to FIU in the summer as a junior to do my BA in CS and I'm worried I might not be able to get the classes I want before I'm allowed to register. I'm currently a fully online student and specifically looking to take ENC3249 in the summer and COT3100, COP3337, CGS3095, and two marketing minor classes in fall. I saw the registration for summer and fall opens somewhere in March and I still need to submit my final transcripts (won't get till mid May), add my minor, and submit a co-requisite exemption form cause I already did COP2210 for COT3100 at my current school. I'm worried and stressed, does anyone know if I'm okay and classes fill slowly or this might delay my graduation? \ud83d\ude22",

You should be fine though, that lineup isn\u2019t terribly difficult especially if you have some prior knowledge. Just steer clear of Rahn at all costs.",

They should allow the override if you\u2019ve taken something that qualifies. For example I took Discrete Math when I was at Broward College so I didn\u2019t have to do discrete structures. \n\nEdit: I don\u2019t even think that an override will be necessary since all accepted classes are entered as if you took them at FIU. I never had do do an override for my courses, everything just got accepted. May wanna double check that tho",

I'm just extremely stressed and freaked out at the fact both fall and summer registration dates are the same and I possibly won't be able to get my classes, I don't want to end up only taking 1-2 classes in the fall and delaying my graduation, just wasting my time. I don't even know when I can register for classes. I honestly don't know what to do, I've already scheduled appointments with several people who could help, I pray they will help my worries.",

Classes fill quick, but there\u2019s almost always openings for core curriculum. \n\nIf its any consolation, when I transferred to in person classes my advisor lost the form. i wasn\u2019t able to signup for classes till like 3 weeks before they started. I still managed to get good professors, and the classes I needed. \n\nIf all the classes you want are taken remember you\u2019ll need 12 credits of interdisciplinary classes unless you did that already.",

But yeah, I plan on doing the interdisciplinary credits with the classes from the minor in general marketing. Your consolation really helped me.

College had been an administrative shit show lol. \n\nIf it helps though, try not to think about the implications of stuff too much, just do what you need to do and remember its not a race to get done with everything. Idk what job you\u2019re shooting for but it wasn\u2019t until I was almost done with my CS core classes that im like \u201cProgramming as a job really ain\u2019t it for me\u201d and began looking into other options\n\nAlso off topic but something I found out recently. If you\u2019re interest in Grad school, as a BA CS student you can\u2019t do a Masters in CS. You can however do a Masters in IT or Cyber Security.",

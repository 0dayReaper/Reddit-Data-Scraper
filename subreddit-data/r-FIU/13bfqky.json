    "postText": "I want to apply for Music Education using a vocal audition. I plan to double major with jazz performance and feel well prepared on an audition for that on guitar. I\u2019ve been singing for a long time and know how to sightsing but I don\u2019t have that much classical training vocally. I\u2019m more of a bari tenor and have found some contemporary art pieces but not having much luck. Any advice?",

            "comment": "What advice are you looking for? Specific pieces to audition with for voice?\n\nSome other notes.\n\nAs a heads up, the music ed program is pretty demanding, if you\u2019re trying to double major with a different instrument you\u2019re gonna have a pretty full schedule. Definitely consider focusing on one instrument with the second as a minor.\n\nClasses wise you\u2019ll be taking sight singing 1-4, music theory 1-4, among other things. A lot of people start from scratch with these subjects so don\u2019t sweat it too much. There is a placement test.\n\nThat said it\u2019s a good school, great placement for music ed, and has one of the best advisors on campus. \n\nAnother bit is, you can join some of the group ensembles there without being a music major, consider auditioning for their jazz guitar ensemble or jazz vocal ensemble (or even university singers).\n\nEven if you don\u2019t get in you\u2019ll get your face and effort recognized which will seal the deal if/when you transfer in later.",

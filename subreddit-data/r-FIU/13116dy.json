I recommend reaching out to your advisor through the panther success network on your my FIU portal, and make them aware of your situation! They will clear up any concerns and answer questions you may have. Once I talked to my advisor, he understood and was able to really relieve a lot of my worries! I hope this helped",

But I still recommend emailing and scheduling a call with your assigned advisor just in case",

I wanted to do my classes online but my advisor told me that since it would be my first semester at FIU, it needed to be done in person, so i deferred my start date to fall. in the deferral application u need to explain why u want to defer so i recommend going into detail about ur situation and hopefully it will go through. Another option is deferring it to spring but before you do anything ask your advisor about it.",

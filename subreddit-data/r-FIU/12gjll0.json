Is the permission number needed to enroll in the class, and if so, where do I get it from? Note: I will meet all the prerequisites by the end of this semester, if that is the issue.",

When I spoke to the drop-in advisor, I was told that they would not allow me to take the class in the fall because they try to reserve the spots for seniors graduating sooner.\n\nBest bet would be to try emailing your advisor.",

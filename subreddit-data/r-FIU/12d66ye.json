    "postText": "Hello guys, I am subleasing my unit in a 4x4 apartment at the One for April - end of July. The rent is $1199/month (plus electricity bill for around $30/month). Water bills included in the rent, no additional fee. My room is on the 19th floor so it has a beautiful view, in-unit washer &amp; dryer, private bathrooms, and a fully-equipped kitchen. \n\nRoommates have no pets, all boys and everything is in great condition. DM me if interested. Sublease available at the end of April -  move in day negotiable. \n\nPhone: 786-714-6664 (Tin Nguyen).\nFeel free to send me a message if you have any questions. Have a good day!",

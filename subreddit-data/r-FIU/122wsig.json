    "postText": "\nApplied to the school of business for a Management Information Systems degree but got rejected and offered economics... \n\nI'm trying to figure out if i should attend here and do economics or just go anywhere else where they'll take me. Is it possible for an economics major to get a certificate in Management Information Systems? Any economics alumni or current students that are in the economics program? How do you like it? What are your thoughts? I like the campus but I dont mind if I don't go. I got admitted to start in Summer.\n\nI am undecided. I am appealing the FIU business rejection, have already applied to FAU but need to decide soon.",

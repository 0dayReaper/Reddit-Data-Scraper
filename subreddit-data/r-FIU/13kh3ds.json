    "postText": "For context, I am a very low income, independent, single parent, with a 4.0 from 2 associates degrees out of state. This is not intended to be bragging.\n\nFIU:\n\nI am enrolled in classes, accepted into housing, part of Honor College (planning to study abroad and do ARCH), and approved for a dual degree. Very much favouring this transfer. They quoted me $12k a semester after aid and grants, I can not afford this. I am applying for Honors scholarships, don't know how much I'll recieve. \n\nUniversity of Miami:\n\nJust received my acceptance May 2nd, completed orientation, have not accepted yet. Received my \"guaranteed\" funding from aid and need today. Total YEARLY cost to me is $2,500. Yes, less than 3k ALL expenses included for a school that costs $88,000 a year. Guaranteed until I get my bachelor degrees as long as I keep above a 3.0 and demonstrate financial need.\n\nI think I am leaning toward FIU if I can get the cost as low as UM is offering. But I will need to apply for scholarships yearly through out my time. I am not much of a party person, not a traditional student (26NB), queer, and a parent (although until I can solidify family housing my child will be living out of state with my family) thus I am concerned for the possible atmosphere at UM vs. FIU which is much more inclusive.\n\nPrice is a big issue for me, so ultimately it depends on overall cost, but after scholarships they should be close to the same and I will be working while attending. Which would you choose?",

Also, FIU has LGBTQIA+ housing and support, has a high percentage of international students, is an R1 college for undergrad research, and has a much more diverse student base and anthropological studies. After scholarships, FIU should hopefully cost close to the same, but without food cost. \n\nI am also completely set to go to FIU (enrollment, dual degree, housing, honors college, flights). Where as UM, I literally have nothing set for because they did not give financial aid until today and must accept or decline by May 30th.. the timeline stresses me out. Lol",

Yes there are affluent students but the amount of international students from China and the middle east makes it an especially great networking community with further outreach. The campus is beautiful and you will have top notch professors along the way. \n\nAs someone else said FIU does nickel and dime you with fees, if you can go to UM for the price you mentioned, DO IT.",

(I *think* the main points are age, tax filing status/dependants, and living situation). However, anyone under 26 needs to file all their parents tax info into CSS to apply for financial aid, but you can call UM after filing that and ask if you qualify as a financially independent student so they base your aid off your income not your parents.",

            "comment": "UM is probably the more prestigious school, and if it's less expensive, too, then those are powerful points in its favor, especially if you know you'll have funding the whole time you're there.  If study abroad is important to you, I'd imagine UM would offer similar opportunities.  Is it possible for you to investigate this before you decide?\n\nIf you hated UM for some reason, or if somehow you lost your funding, then it seems like you could always apply to transfer to FIU, which I'd imagine would be cheaper even without funding, right?  (Obviously still expensive since you will be out of state.)  If you started out at FIU and then for some reason couldn't continue there (funding loss, etc.) and you tried to apply to UM, could you afford it?  This line of thinking assumes that funding would be harder to get coming to a school as a transfer student.  If that's true, then it's another point in favor of UM.\n\nThe potential snobbiness of the UM student body (which I have no experience of and am merely speculating about) would be a negative.  FIU might be a more comfortable fit for you socially.  But if you're not a big party person, and if you'll be living off campus and taking care of your child when you're not studying, then that wouldn't necessarily matter much.\n\nWould it be possible for you to tour UM and get a better feel for the place?",

In-state FIU tuition is probably $7k or so a semester while UM is $25k+ if I remember right. FIU is definitely the place to go for non-traditional students as well usually. For undergrad, just go where the money is tbh. If that is somehow UM for you, then go for it",

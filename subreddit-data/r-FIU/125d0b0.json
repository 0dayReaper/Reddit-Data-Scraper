To those of you who went back for a second bachelor's, what obstacles did you face? Were you able to secure scholarships and grants?",

But I was able to get financial aid for it and it\u2019s short because you only have to take the major requirements. If you need prerequisites for law school, just take those. There\u2019s no need for a second bachelors degree unless you plan on switching fields type of thing *\n\nEdit to add * or if you really need to raise your GPA",

I know for a fact I was offered loans and I can\u2019t recall grants. Maybe a very small amount, but definitely not enough to cover the semester",

Your extracurriculars might make the difference if its a toss up with your GPA and LSAT but a second bachelors won't. All in all, you didn't mess up, you finished early and can now focus on applying to law school.",

If anything, I\u2019m thriving in school compared to my first time around. I\u2019m better at studying and understand how the system works. Don\u2019t be discouraged, good luck!",

But I like the idea of having more options if I learn hardware too. But I guess I can only make a final decision once im taking more of the core classes and see what its like. what did you get your first bachelors in?",

            "comment": "A second bachelors would usually entail completing a total of 150 credits. (You can start with whichever amount of credits you\u2019ve already wanted at FIU - 120), so you would only need 30 credits to complete. The only type of aid you would earn for a second bachelors are loans (no grant money whatsoever). Second bachelors are usually for those finishing prerequisites, raising gpa, or getting into the program they wanted. Now for law school, it\u2019s all about gpa, lsat, and experience. A strong lsat score with a solid personal statement and resume, with a decent gpa can open a lot of rooms. Of course, you would have to do your research on which schools and what their requirements are, but if your gpa was like 2.3 and you want to go to law school, a second ba may very likely be an option",

But I feel more motivated to do well because I\u2019m only doing prerequisites for medical school",

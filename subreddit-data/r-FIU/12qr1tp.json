    "postText": "I\u2019m a freshman and I enrolled in Band at the beginning of this Spring semester however it doesn\u2019t pertain to my major. I tried dropping out but I was told I couldn\u2019t as I needed 5 classes and I had just switched majors and my prior major also didn\u2019t need band. I would show up for the first 2 months but then I got a really bad cold and band director cancelled class for 2 weeks and my cold still hasn\u2019t gone away but I haven\u2019t been showing up to class much since after spring break. If i stopped showing up plus didn\u2019t take the final or maybe did take the final, would it possibly harm my college career?",

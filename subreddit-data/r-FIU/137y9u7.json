The academic year starts in August and runs for three semesters, which are:  \nFall (August - Early December)  \nSpring (January - Late April)  \nSummer (May - July).\n\nIf you start in the spring and take summer as well, you would be in for two semesters of the 2-2023-2024 academic year that starts in August 2023.

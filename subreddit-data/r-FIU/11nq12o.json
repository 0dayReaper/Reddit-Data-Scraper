I\u2019ve had a few encounters here and there in the general area but nothing that made me deem the FIU area or Sweetwater as completely unsafe. As a woman, there was a time I was walking in Miami, with a group of people, and was being followed by two guys in an aggressive cat calling kind of way. \n\nI grew up all over Miami-Dade county and have experienced a lot of the questionable areas so that\u2019s why I say Miami is a little unsafe in general to me. Not the most dangerous in the state, but to air on the side of caution. As for limiting to just the FIU and Sweetwater area, yeah it\u2019s not too bad.",

From campus to malls to even UM (Don\u2019t recommend) never had any problems. Even rode my bike multiple times to get food at 3 am at Taco Bell or the 24 hour cafe on Flagler street when I was tired of studying or had the munchies\ud83d\ude05best thing I would recommend overall is never say never and just pay attention to your surroundings. \ud83d\ude4f",

The surrounding areas are generally tranquil but if she decides to grab food at night, it's always best to go with someone.\n\nLooking at the map, the way to Aldi has heavy traffic so definitely ride on the sidewalk for that one.\n\nThe area south of FIU is residential and very calm.

You need to email the grad advisor https://www.cis.fiu.edu/faculty-staff/arocha-rebeca/\n\nThe tuition should be graduate tuition cost of one credit * 9 (usually full time means 9)  x 3 (for being international student) plus FEES \n\nhttps://onestop.fiu.edu/finances/estimate-your-costs/graduate-tuition-fees/\n\nIf you want to cybersecurity and you are not even finding those sites, I would wonder how would you do in the program since it was easier for you to ask here than search.",

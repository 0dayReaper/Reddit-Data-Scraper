I avoided the mail issues cause I had stuff shipped to my parents house who live here in Miami, and the 1 problem I had was when 2 of my guests had their cars towed exactly 5 minutes after the \u201ccurfew\u201d was up. \n\nI still see tow trucks sitting waiting to tow people the second the clock passes the curfew time.\n\nI guess I got lucky that I didn\u2019t have many personal issues there.",

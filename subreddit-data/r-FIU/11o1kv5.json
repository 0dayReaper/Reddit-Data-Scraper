    "postText": "I was wondering if there are any up-and-coming freshman here that are starting summer or fall and have received their financial aid package for fall/spring. I have called the financial aid office multiple times and have received different answers for when I can expect to see what aid they give me (One told me mid march and another told my mid-late june). I have talked to friends and it seems like some have received their  package already.",

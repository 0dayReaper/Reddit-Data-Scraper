I assume this isn't the page to do this, but can anyone direct me to a place to find roommates?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I want to live off campus because I have a full bedroom set and a nice couch from my current location and don't want to get rid of it. Renting a storage unit plus FIU housing adds up to pretty much the cost of an apartment.\n\nEDIT 2: I also have a pet",

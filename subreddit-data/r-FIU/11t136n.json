    "postText": "Hello! \n\nI will be attending FIU Law this Fall in August. I'm trying to get a jump start on looking for housing... but I don't even know where to start! Does anyone have any tips on how to find a good place to live in the area? I'm looking to live somewhere not too far from campus, 2-3 roommates. Hopefully looking to spend less than $1000 in rent. If that's even possible?",

    "postText": "Hi Panthers!\n\nI am looking for some easy online summer classes. I have to remain an actively enrolled student this summer for some eligibility requirements for a program, but I will be doing an internship in a place with limited internet access and it will be very difficult to take online classes at the time. It's not important which classes I take, just that my student status is active.\n\nDoes anybody have recommendations for easy online summer classes? It would be especially great if the class opens most/all content at the beginning, so I can do it ahead of time. I've thought about completing the content ahead of time and having one of my friends submit the assignments through the summer when I don't have internet access. Any suggestions are appreciated!\n\nAlso, has anybody taken History of the Beatles with Armando Tranquilino? It looks like a great option. \n\nThanks in advance :)",

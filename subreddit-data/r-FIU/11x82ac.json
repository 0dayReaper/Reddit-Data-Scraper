Take the shuttle earlier than you usually do just to be on the safe side.\n2) Get on the bus early as well to ensure you have a preferable seat.",

Every time other than 9:30pm the shuttle leaves every half hour. THE SHUTTLE DOES NOT WAIT! As soon as it's the half hour, the fucker is gone. So even if you're 2 minutes late for it, you're gonna have to wait until the next one. Otherwise at night when there is little traffic the trip will be like 40 minutes and then during day it'll be around an hour. Longest I've had was a little over an hour and a half.",

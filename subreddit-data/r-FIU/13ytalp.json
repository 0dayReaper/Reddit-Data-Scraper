Is this how it always is? I wanted to get in early to get good classes and be able to speak with an advisor. Also if anyone knows when does signup for fall classes begin?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vjmul6gvuo3b1.png?width=901&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3d5130f6ececf6db3d286b8b79be2033bc0a5e99",

Another thing you can do is message your advisor on [PSN](http://go.fiu.edu/psn).",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nSo I have been accepted into FIU (Honors program), FSU, and UM as a transfer student for next fall. Honestly, I have no idea which one to choose. I live in Fort Lauderdale, an hour and a half away from UM and FIU. I would probably need to move to Miami to be closer to the schools, which is extremely expensive right now (I am not interested in student housing since I have lived with my partner for many years). FIU's pros are its flexibility and affordability, and I heard that the honors program is excellent. Also, I have a full-ride. Cons for FIU are the expensive housing in Miami and I feel that it's not as \"prestigious\" as the other ones I have been accepted to. I'm not really considering UM due to the cost. Then FSU, economically and academically makes sense, Tallahassee seems to be much cheaper (from the research I've done), so I'd be saving a lot of money. FSU is top three schools in FL so it's a better value overall. Con's is, well ... Tallahassee. Some more information is that I am a political science major, and my main goal is to go to law school. Which one would you guys choose?",

If you\u2019re young, then the next 2-4 years in Tallahassee will be nothing compared to the grander scheme of your life and what you\u2019ll experience. \n\nPro\u2019s for FSU\u2014which i HATE because i\u2019m born and raised in miami and root for UM even though i graduated from FIU\u2014affordable housing, school name recognition, and top tier education.",

            "comment": "It ultimately has to do with what works for you. You said you live in Fort Lauderdale and are a political science major. This means most if not all of your classes will be at the Modesto Maidique Campus (MMC). You don't necessarily have to drive to MMC on your own. Since you're closer to the Biscayne Bay Campus in North Miami, you could park your car there and take the shuttle which is free. Apart from that FIU has a competitive political science program and is the only university in the state that has a center in Washington D.C. If you were to intern over there, you'd be supported by the staff in that office. You're also going to FIU for free which is a literal gift. Not only this you'd also be in the Honors College meaning you'd get extra support in comparison to the rest of the student body. Name recognition is important but over time it isn't worth as much. Working graduates have said that was matters most is your experience and what you bring to the table. Also just an FYI, FIU isn't as \"prestigious\" as FSU or UM but it is definitely up and coming. It ranks higher in the rankings every year and is definitely academically challenging. You'll also be in a city that'll have lots more political attention considering the election year next year. At the end of the day, this is your decision and you have to figure out what works best for you! Best of luck in your decision making :)",

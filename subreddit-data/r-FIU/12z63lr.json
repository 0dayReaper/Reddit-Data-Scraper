    "postText": "I am currently a freshman, and this is only my third semester at fiu. Towards the end of this semester I was caught using AI for an assignment. I was desperate to turn something in on time. I ended up coming clean to my professor, and he said if I did it again, or had any percent of a plagiarism on my upcoming work, that I would be reported to academic affairs. I just turned in my final paper which I truly wrote myself. However, when I put it through all my detectors for grammar and plagiarism\u2026 i had a high rating for plagiarism. If he thinks I purposely plagiarized again and get reported, what will happen? Will I get expelled?",

It's best to learn these skills now before you get into the thick of harder courses.",

If you are getting such a high score it sounds like you must be copy/pasting a lot of pieces of the paper, which will be a problem even if you are giving credit. It\u2019s always better to reword/rephrase someone else\u2019s work in your own words (and credit them appropriately!). As  someone  else said, the percent should be no more than 7-15%.",

The second hearing isn\u2019t mandatory, you can ask for summary resolution in the information hearing and it may result in a lesser penalty. \n\nDepending on the severity, you may get put on academic suspension, however if its your first recorded time getting reported to the office, more likely than not you\u2019ll get a lesser punishment either failing the assignment or the class and having to do a project. Since you mentioned two potential violations, that might impact what happens if you can\u2019t prove that you wrote the final paper yourself. \n\nMy advice to you, don\u2019t try and cut corners with your assignments, and maybe meet with someone in the writing lab about the final paper. Unless you ripped a lot of stuff directly from your sources your rating should easily be less than 15%. If you messed up your citations that could also be an issue.",

There is only one solution to a high plagiarism score, it's to rewrite so that your work doesn't match word for word with some other source on the internet and accurately cite your quotations. Even with accurate citations, still minimize your quotations to a small amount of your paper.",

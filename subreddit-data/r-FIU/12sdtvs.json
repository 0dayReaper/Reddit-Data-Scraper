You got a nice pool, good gym, and a little mini store for snacks and food when necessary. Location is right next to the college. People are seriously picky these days so one minor thing is like catastrophic for them. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing perfect here so pick something that fits most of what you\u2019re looking for for your price range and live.",

Classes get full so fast once they are open to everyone and I have never had to stress about it. Plus it\u2019s not that hard to stay in, the classes are fun you can pick from a range of topics and they count as your upper division electives (major depending) and the community service req is low.",

            "comment": "I think the biggest pro is early registration. That is super clutch and helpful. However, having a required Honors course each semester does add up in the long run because you\u2019re taking one less major course or elective in your schedule. For me being a double major, that slightly extended my schedule but I wasn\u2019t in a rush to graduate anyways.\n\nhowever, I found the Honors College classes to be very interesting so that was pretty cool. Some of my best class memories were in HC seminars and I think the advisors/faculty were great.",

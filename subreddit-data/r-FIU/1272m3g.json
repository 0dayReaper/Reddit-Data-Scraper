    "postText": "I have three holds on my account. My final transcript which I\u2019ve already submitted, my photo id where I have to take a pic against a white background but the link doesn\u2019t send me to where I can submit it, and I have not been able to take the sexual assault prevention 2 class that is required to be able to register for summer classes. I\u2019ve been trying to get this fixed for the past month and nothing has been done about it and now I probably won\u2019t be able to register for classes. Has anyone else had any of these problems? I can\u2019t get a reply from anyone not even my advisor and registered is this coming Tuesday",

I live in north Florida though so it\u2019s like a 6 hour drive but communicating by email is impossible and if I can get anyone on the phone they just pass me around person to person because nobody knows anything",

If it\u2019s a to-do you still need to take care of it but you\u2019ll be able to enroll on Tuesday. Also if you need to submit docs to OneStop, it usually helps to scan everything together as part of one pdf doc! Good luck!",

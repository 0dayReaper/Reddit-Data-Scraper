            "comment": "Idk about lapis specifically, but here\u2019s some general rental advice.\n\nSo first- check your lease. It may have a clause with conditions for breaking it. If not, you are legally responsible for it (both financially and for keeping an eye on the property) unless you reach some sort of agreement with the landlord/company. You may have the option to sublet or find someone to take it over entirely which is probably your ideal situation here. You may also be able to break it by paying a fee.\n\nWhatever you do needs to be in writing.\n\nEdit: I am not a lawyer so seek legal advice. These may not be the only options. \n\nSource: recently broke a lease.",

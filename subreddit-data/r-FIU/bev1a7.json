It\u2019s harmful to our environment, and sadly I\u2019ve been seeing these things littered around campus lately. Even if you clean up after the shoot, the glitter/confetti is going to end up somewhere else in the environment, so it\u2019s better to use a biodegradable alternative such as flower petals!",

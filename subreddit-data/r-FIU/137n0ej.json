    "postText": "failed my ACG course twice for two semesters in a row. Personal issues got in the way, I know I\u2019m prone to getting kicked out business school, but I wanted to know who can I talk to before over $15,000 and my whole degree path go down the drain? I can\u2019t imagine myself switching to another major after dedicating so much classes and time to this major. These advisors are not helpful at all so someone higher up would be super appreciated",

            "comment": "I recommend getting any and all proof or documentation of your situation for either semester you failed the class. Nobody will really be able to do anything about the grade unless you go through the petition process to get the grade forgiven or removed from your record. Then you could retake the class.\n\nhttps://onestop.fiu.edu/classes/grade-forgiveness/\n\nIf you were not able to complete class work, you may be able to request your grade be changed to an incomplete, but that conversation typically happens before grades are submitted.\n\nI definitely recommend trying to speak to the chairperson, given the university enrollment numbers are down, they may be a little more flexible about giving you a third retake. For example, they recently lowered the BBA minimum GPA and got rid of the accounting entrance exam, so there might a chance they can make an exception. Find out who the department chair is, and cc them on the emails to your advisors or program directors.",

            "comment": "As the person above me said, your best shot is to petition the two attempts if you have supporting documentation that there were extenuating circumstances. You may not be able to take upper division business courses while the petition is reviewed.\nETA: the COB gpa requirement change was due to state requirements changing, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they will make an exception unless extenuating circumstances are documented and the grade removal is approved. If you don\u2019t have a documented reason, I\u2019d really encourage you to start considering and planning for another major.",

If you\u2019re gonna switch from CS to something like psychology or business, I wouldn\u2019t. \nGPA might not matter as much as you think. Also if you fail, you can do grade forgiveness so that it doesn\u2019t affect as much, you can do it a couple of times total I believe",

It\u2019s not an easy major but it is doable with enough effort",

At the moment I'm trying to knock out some certifications before I go back for an IT Master's in the fall. \n\nAll in all, the 3 months of post-grad life have been fairly boring and mediocre with me trying to figure out what I want to do. I highly recommend you find a track you want to gravitate towards before you get too deep into your classes. I also recommend trying to pin down an internship around the time that you take Data Structures because having one will massively help your chances post-graduation. Hell, you might even get offered a full-time position after your internship ends. I know of a few people who got offered that.",

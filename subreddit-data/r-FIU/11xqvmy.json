    "postText": "Hello everyone! I am currently applying as an international transfer student (studied outside of the US but I am a US citizen) for this upcoming summer semester. Last friday my status got changed to **Referred to Dept for Review** but it has been a very slow process and I am worried it will take another 3 weeks to get a decision.\n\nDid anybody else receive this status and how long did it take to have a decision? I will be moving to the US if I get accepted so I need to know soon so I get everything ready :) \n\nThanksss!! At this point I am super anxious as I started my application back in December and it took a lot of time to have my documents processed",

I got a reply after around a month. I\u2019d recommend you call onestop regularly since you\u2019re on a tight deadline",

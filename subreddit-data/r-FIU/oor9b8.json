So basically there is \" Zero Cost Materials,\" but you're definitely paying for it.\n\nI remember when schools made drug deals with publishers like McGraw Hill where each course would personalize the book for the school....\n\nso at one school the math problem may use references to fruit in the problem; but another college would have references made to bikes, but the number of items did not change....thus making the school a shit-tonne of money.",

From what I\u2019ve seen, $20 per credit hour comes out to a lot cheaper than buying the books from the website. Am I missing something here?",

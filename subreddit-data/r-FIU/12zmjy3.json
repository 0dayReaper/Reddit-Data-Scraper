I just failed my College algebra course and its my fault for not paying attention. Today Ive made myself a promise to stop slacking in school &amp; pickup my grades. Some questions I have:\n\nCan I still bring up my gpa? \n\nWhats are some courses you recommend I take ? \n\nHow do I get involved in more social networking or clubs regarding programming ?",

As long as you get that AA fiu will take you in. MDC doesn't offer much in the social sphere but there's something called UPE which is basically the biggest  tech group for FIU and MDC students . If you have any questions feel free to dm me",

If the class opens youll get a notification and u gotta quickly enroll before anyone else. You can only track 1 class at a time, so if you want to track more than one class id ask a friend or family to also download the app and follow the other course or pay for the delux stuff, which i didnt do. Good Luck!",

There may be a reason why the OP can\u2019t enroll. Also, you don\u2019t know if the professor is an adjunct and he will teach for the first time in spring so he is not checking his emails. \n\nIt seems that the OP emailed the chair. Horrible advise from someone above that says that they teach undergrads. I\u2019m a professor and I would have serious reservation as a colleague from the poster suggesting to email the chair. This is not because the professor may hate the student afterwards, as I doubt many will worry about it, but it is because is not professional. Also, for many tenured professors and even the untenure, run their class as they see fit and the chair is not like a boss in a company. \n\nEmail an undergrad advisor from the major or get an appointment or talk to the one from your major.",

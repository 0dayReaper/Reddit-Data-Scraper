            "comment": "If you applied for Computer Science, there\u2019s 2 options. You have the BA and the BS. If you chose to apply for the BA in CS, then it would say \u201cComputer Science - BA\u201d, whereas if you selected BS, that\u2019s where things may be different. To get admitted into the BS program, you need to be Calculus ready. Since you start in the summer and got accepted under the STEP pathway, this means your major will say \u201cEngineering - BS\u201d. Frankly, you\u2019re still a CS major, however, you need to get some prerequisites done such as ENC1101, ENC1102, MAC1105, and MAC1147 in order to enter the BS in CS program in the spring term. Hope this helps!\n\nEdit: Note that the BA in CS can either be done fully online or in-person (up to you) but the BS is only available in person.\n\nEdit 2: As one of the users said earlier, any course labeled as \u201cU0X\u201d, where X represents any number, indicates that the course is in person, whereas if a course says \u201cRVC\u201d or starts with R, is an online course.",

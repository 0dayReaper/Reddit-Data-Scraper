When you go to the registration page for orientation, it will show you all the dates and times and say either the location on campus or \"remote\" next to it. Keep in mind the time change. All the dates and times are Eastern time.\n\nIf you can't find one that works for you, contact your academic advisor through the student success network under the academic advising tab on your FIU home page.",

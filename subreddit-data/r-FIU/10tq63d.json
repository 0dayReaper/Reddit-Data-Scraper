    "postText": "My online MAC1147 exam was proctored over zoom instead of Honorlock like I\u2019ve used at every other school. It took nearly 40 minutes for us to start the test because every student coming in late had to ask the same question that the professor had just answered before they showed up 30 minutes late. We didn\u2019t even get to start the exam til almost 10pm, is this how the math department does their exams or is my professor just trying to be cute and do things a much harder way?",

Also, you can also email any fiu emails you find on the fiu website and ask for guidance or directly call fiu. I'm sure someone will be happy to help. I dont remember exactly how I contacted them when I first applied, but there was an FIU representative in my country and I met up with them to go over my application and any doubts I may have. Call and email until you get an application advisor and all the info that you need!",

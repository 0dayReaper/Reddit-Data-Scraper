    "postText": "Hey guys! I figured I'd put myself out there before the spring semester starts and see if anyone would be interested in being friends or just hanging out after the break if over! :)\n\n I'm currently a senior majoring in biology, (hoping to graduate next fall\ud83e\udd1e) I'm a big anime fan (watching spy x family as I write this!), but I also love horror (novels and movies), the outdoors, museums/aquariums, and generally finding new and exciting places/things in the city. I also wouldn't mind a gym buddy that doesn't mind that I'm a beginner! I'm an introvert so I'm generally very shy when I first meet people, but I would love to experience new things with cool people :)",

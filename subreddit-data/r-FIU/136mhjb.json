    "postText": "The title says all, I'm on track to graduate this Fall with a BS in IT but the last course I need (CTS4408) is completely full Summer AND Fall. Currently in 8th and 19th on the waitlist respectively. My Advisor says I can either get lucky and more options for Fall are added or I take it on Spring 24 and graduate then. Is there anything I can do to speed up the process or do I just wait and see?\n\nIf anyone has had experience being waitlisted, what are the odds I'm going to make the Fall enrollment? Thanks.",

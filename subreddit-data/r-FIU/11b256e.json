    "postText": "I had applied to fall 2023 but got denied about 2 months ago. Today I randomly get an email saying congratulations on acceptance to FIU. I check my student portal and my denied changed to accepted. But so did fall 2023 change to spring 2024. Is this normal/supposed to happen? How is FIU and would starting in the spring be any worse than the fall?",

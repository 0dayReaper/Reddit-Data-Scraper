    "postText": "Hey y'all, I'm trying to apply to FIU's MS in Mechanical Engineering - Robotics for Mechanical Engineers track for my grad school and I learned that for the 3 letters of recommendation required, they need the recommenders to fill out this form instead of writing an actual letter? Is this the standard across all of FIU or do they still accept normal letters? This is the first time I've seen this format be used so it caught me off guard and confused me a bit. Thanks!",

I did two employer LORs and one faculty LOR. I thought about normal letters, but I\u2019m sure the template is in place to better streamline the applicant process. Hope this helps.",

With my degree program tat just want the 3 letters and a letter of intent/statement of purpose thing. Do they have a preference on word count, format, font, etc.? The instructions aren't very clear, since all they say in the \"supporting documents\" section is to provide the supporting materials that I have, with the options being \"essay\" or \"other\"",

They had no clear instructions as far for the format and all that jazz, so I made sure to follow the traditional format for graduate personal statements! I used double-space using Times New Roman, and indented first line. For my header, I put:\n\nStatement of Purpose\n\nMaster of Biomedical Engineering \n\nJane Doe\n\nIf you need any more help, feel free to PM me! I believe that this is the last year FIU doesn\u2019t require the GRE (I think they\u2019ll implement it again after Fall). I applied last year and they didn\u2019t require it.",

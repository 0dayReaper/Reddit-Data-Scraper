    "postText": "Last year, I got a new plate for my car. This past Spring semester, I got two citations stating I didn\u2019t have the valid permit for two separate dates in the semester, despite having gone more than 1 time. \n\nI checked the portal, which I hadn\u2019t done in forever, and my new plate was one the portal, so at some point I actually remembered to do it prior to this semester. \n\nI did the regular appeals process, sent screenshots that my vehicle was listed, waited two months, my citation was denied and I check again this morning and my portal now shows my old plate?? Has this ever happened to anyone else? Is there a way to check changes in your account or obtain the appeal decision submission?",

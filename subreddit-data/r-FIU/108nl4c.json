    "postText": "Does anyone else have the problem where your discord ping will randomly spike to 3000 about every 5 mins and you will have to disconnect and reconnect to the call for it to work again? This is on both the secure and unsecured network. I've talked with discord about it and they have tried multiple things but ultimately determined it has to do with the schools network",

I contacted the FIU DoIT and the only suggestion they have for that is to force your pc to use the 5ghz band, and they can also change your Internet account to the gaming workgroup. Neither of these things fixed the issue for me. Discord VC was literally unusable for my time at FIU (2019-2022)",

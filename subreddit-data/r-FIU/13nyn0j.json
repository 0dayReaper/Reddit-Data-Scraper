    "postText": "I\u2019m about to graduate with a Bachelor\u2019s in Psychology this Summer. I wanted to pursue the Master\u2019s in Professional Counseling Psychology, but the deadline to apply this Fall has passed. I have to an entire year until Fall of 2024. I looked into the Master\u2019s in Social Work and it sounds promising. I\u2019m considering this program, but I\u2019d like to know if it\u2019s worth it from someone who actually took it or is currently taking it.",

            "comment": "Define \"worth it?\"  FIU's social work program isn't rated particularly highly in the U.S. News rankings but is CSWE accredited and certainly cheaper than going to Barry. (Barry is 18 months vs two years though.) FWIW, FIU is rated as #72 in social work and #140 in psychology for graduate programs. While these are both degrees that can lead to licensure and practice as a master's level provider/therapist, the nature of the education and training are different.  Furthermore, social work isn't limited to clinical/therapy practice and if you're NOT looking for training on macro and mezzo level intervention as well as policy, some of your class time will be \"wasted\".\n\nIf you're looking for the fastest way to become a licensed therapist, social work will accomplish this assuming you get in sooner than the PCP program as the post-graduate requirements seem to be the same: [https://floridasmentalhealthprofessions.gov/licensing/](https://floridasmentalhealthprofessions.gov/licensing/) . If your only interest is becoming a therapist as quickly as possible, I think my earlier point about the wasted class time is irrelevant. I also want to note that the recent changes to legislation will now allow LMHCs and (I think) LMFTs to bill Medicare, so that specific advantage to social work is now a moot point.\n\nA brief look at the PCP program handbook shows me that there is more flexibility in delivery (a hybrid option) and that the internship is spread out over 5 semesters compared to 3 semesters in the MSW program though the total hour requirements seem to be the same.\n\nThis really depends on what you want to do.",

            "comment": "The classes are different so you may want to wait. But if you do wait, look up the accreditation of the Master\u2019s in Professional Counseling Psychology. In Florida,  'Beginning July 1, 2025, an applicant must have a master\u2019s degree from a program that is accredited by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP), the Masters in Psychology and Counseling Accreditation Council (MPCAC), or an equivalent accrediting body which consists of at least 60 semester hours or 80 quarter hours to apply for licensure'. That program isn't accredited currently.",

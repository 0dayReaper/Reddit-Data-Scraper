    "postText": "I'm currently a UCF student in my sophomore year and I want to have a career in South Florida as a programmer. I'm thinking about possibly transferring to FIU to get more connections in the place I want to live.\n\nI'm interested in game development in particular, but I don't necessarily need a job like that.\n\nHow is the CS program at FIU? Is there any significant difference in internship opportunities between UCF and FIU for CS students? Do any companies worth working at give a shit about the difference between a B.S. in Computer Science at UCF vs FIU?",

If you work hard, study, do personal projects, grind leetcode, seek referrals for interviews you should be perfectly fine.\n\nYeah, I figured that most of the difference between applicants for a programming position would come from things that don't directly have to do with the particular university you go to.",

It\u2019s had lots of FAANG interns and FTE (myself being one of them). The club has a lot of resources and connections with big tech.\n\nOutside of that, the actual CS program is whatever, nothing special.",

I got my position at Microsoft because of them :)\n\nTo join, you can simply just attend one of their events, message them on social media, or apply online. You can simply just attend their events and be active in the community or join their e-board/committees (recommend).",

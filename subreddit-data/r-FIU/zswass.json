    "postText": "Took this class last semester, because it was required in order for me to take another class I wanted to take. Only problem is that I can\u2019t remember what class it was now. I have a feeling it has something to do with forensics but I might be completely wrong. Any way for me to figure it out?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m talking about the class CCJ 4014 unlocked for me, not CCJ 4014 itself. I already know which class that was since I just finished taking it.",

    "postText": "I'm moving from a state where cost of living is ~30% less than miami and I'm making $20 an hour just for desk work. I can NOT find an undergrad job in Miami that pays more than $12 an hour and I'd only be working ~20 hours a week while in school. Any leads on jobs? 10-12/hr will barely cover food, let alone rent or tuition.\n\nI am receiving aid and grants, but don't want to take out loans. These wages are completely unsustainable for any type of living.",

You can probably easily to apply to a job like this and then search indeed for higher paying jobs. Xfinity for example used to start at like $18 base and $24 if you met your quota.\n\nJust need to look better. I haven\u2019t made under 15 since before covid.",

I can almost guarantee you\u2019ll make more than $15 an hour after gas and wear and tear if you are strategic about it. You may even get up to $30",

You\u2019d also be in a much better position to find meaningful employment at graduation compared to your peers.\n\nConsider something like machinists helper, construction, assistant at a law firm or doctor\u2019s office. These will provide you with a network and source of mentorship, both of which will be worth significantly more than earning a credential from FIU marginally sooner.",

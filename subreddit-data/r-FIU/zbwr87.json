You can of course find better prices with roommates.",

Food: it honestly depends on you, everyone eats differently and I survived on chipotle 90% of the time in college so I would say around $500/month for food\ud83d\udc80 the cost of living down here has gone up drastically since I graduated so it\u2019s no longer super accurate, idk if you\u2019d even be able to get a decent 1/1 for $2100 anymore lol",

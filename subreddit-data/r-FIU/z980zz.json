Miami is just so expensive and honestly I\u2019d rather go to a different school than spend multiple years struggling to get by.",

Also, it is almost impossible for FIU to police and at worst you loose your gra/gta. You can also open a company and get paid this way. \n\nThis is america!! one there is a will, there is a way.",

    "postText": "I'm a veteran trying to use my education benefits at FIU for the Summer term and get an Information Systems degree as a transfer student from Broward College. \n\nI have all the business pre-requisites only problem is I have 2 third attempts classes (Accounting 2 and Calc) which I fucked up on because of some deployments. I have good grades now that I am out.\n\nOn the other side, I got accepted to the Economics program. (I don't know why I think everyone who didn't make FIU business goes here, correct me if I'm wrong lol) \n\nI tried advising, they told me these are the requirements and can't do anything about it. Today i tried to go talk to the dean but he wasn't there, will come back some other time... \n\nHas anybody been in a similar situation? Could anybody give me some advise? What would you do? I want to overcome this but not very university savvy. Any input is appreciated.",

If only they had been offered with the support that online classes have now. \n\nSucks to hear about that, I understand 100%. In my day they would literally give u a book for calculus with no videos, slides, or anything else, and expect you to have any clue what the hell you are supposed to do. It shouldn\u2019t have to follow you for your entire academic career.",

However I\u2019ve attended FIU since freshman year so I\u2019m not sure if this standard applies only to four year FIU students or transfers as well. The business school has a somewhat strict rule on retaking core classes. You only get two attempts per pre-core and if you fail/drop your second attempt you\u2019re no longer allowed at the business school. I had to retake Accounting 1 and got the warning after I dropped my initial attempt. \n\nKnowing this is a \u201crule\u201d at the school, I would still say your best bet is to reach out to someone and ask about why you may have been declined acceptance. Maybe there\u2019s an appeal process for you since you do have a military background. Best of luck!",

    "postText": "So In about a year I\u2019ll be moving into FIU from mdc in the computer science major . Well I wanted to know if maintaining a high GPA I needed I been studying my ass off to make sure I don\u2019t go below on my GPA I started off studying business administration but it wasn\u2019t my love and failed because I wasn\u2019t simply interested. But now I found a field in computer science and I want to learn more and work with code . As of now I\u2019m doing great in my courses but what should I espect from FIU course wise and hours of study , internships. And at the moment my classes have been online does it mean I\u2019ll be in person from now on which I don\u2019t mind doing I just live quite a bit far now . Also do students help each other study groups etc.",

            "comment": "Okay so, there are CS classes that are online as well as in person. It really depends what you wanna do. \n\nIn general the professors are a mixed bag. You have real shit/pain in the ass ones like Rahn and Peter Clark, then you have amazing professors like Gregory M. Reis, Antonio Hernandez and Kianoosh. Most of the professors are somewhat in between. As long as you\u2019re willing to do what you need to you\u2019ll get good grades for the most part. \n\nThe amount of work/exams and the difficulty of these is hing entirely on the professor. One of the most difficult classes I\u2019ve ever taken was Systems Programming with Jason Liu. It was 50 written response programming questions done on Canvas. The median grade was a 32% before the curve. \n\nInternships are not mandatory however are highly recommended. FIU regularly hosts  career fairs where recruiters for large companies come and accept applications, interview students and disseminate information. It shouldn\u2019t be terribly hard to find one assuming you look for one",

What made you say that he is a pain ? \nAnd if those were the worst but if the other professor average was 32% but you don\u2019t listed as the worst, I wonder why ?",

I\u2019ve also heard that his assignments can be problematic at best. \n\nI didn\u2019t list Liu in the people to avoid for a few reasons. \n\n1) He genuinely knows his shit and I respect him as a professor and programmer. Is he my favorite, no not in the slightest but he is one of the more driven and knowledgeable professors at the school.\n\n2) My biggest gripes with him were the midterm that was horrific and caused half of the class to drop, and him writing up half of the remaining class for using a similar linked list implementation. Mind you, this was a data structure that he didn\u2019t teach the class how to implement. \n\nAs I said he curved the exam so that the median was about a 50% which dramatically improved the grades\u2026 though this was after the drop date. As far as the writeup I can\u2019t fault him for it, MOSS flagged the code and then left it to the Academic Integrity office to handle.",

The exams were during class. \n\nI do know software testing because my partner took it required a bit more work but this may have been her group that were not in top of it. \n\nIn every university you will find professors you like and you don\u2019t like. This is life. No different that work. It is not what they will teach you but what you will discover.",

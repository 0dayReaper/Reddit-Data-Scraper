The Macbook air has tremendous battery life, light weight, and will last you a long time.\n\nFor Windows, I recommend the XPS 13 from Dell. It's small and compact, so it is easier to transport and use in class.",

Might want to upgrade memory to 16GB at some point but that can wait and it won't be expensive, should be under 50. \n\nhttps://www.officedepot.com/a/products/7316678/Lenovo-IdeaPad-3i-Laptop-156-Screen/",

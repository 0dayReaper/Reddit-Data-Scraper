    "postText": "I'm graduating soon and leaving Miami. I'm sorry for the strange post, but I just wanted to post this to get something off my chest. I had a few great memories at FIU; majority of it was spent on mind numbingly boring classes. One of the greatest memories I had was meeting this girl on campus.\n\nI met her in the library one day and ever since that day she was always on my mind. The timing for us was bad and things didn't end well. There's a lot of things left unsaid and things I wish I could've done differently. We're no longer speaking to each other. She had a big impact on my life and she opened my eyes.\n\nShe taught me to be a more kind and compassionate person and see the light. I'm always going to remember her kindness, beautiful smile, cute laugh, goofy dancing, and her love for the arts and music. She's an amazing person and I'm grateful for meeting her. I'm really going to miss hanging out with her at the library, eating together at GC, listening to music, and walking around campus. I'm always going to cherish those memories and she's always going to have a place in my heart.\n\nI hope she keeps herself safe and healthy. Also, I hope she keeps pursuing her goals. I think she's a talented person, but I could always tell she never liked getting out of her comfort-zone and settles. This permeates in all aspects of her life; work, art, friendships, and romance. She settles with being content and feels unappreciated and I'm afraid she's going to end up living an unfulfilling life. I wish we could've continue being part of each other's lives. Anyway, I don't think she has a reddit account, but if you're reading this I dedicate this music video of \"The Reason\" by Hoobastank to you. It sums up how I feel. Maybe I'll run into you at a Hawthorne Heights concert one day if you're ever in Tallahassee or on the west coast . Thank you for everything, please stay safe and always be true to yourself.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/ondst6/video/b7jndnqb36c71/player",

I submitted my application and on my to do list it says to submit a partial and full transcript from my high school and previous college. What is the difference between partial and full and how do I submit them?",

Once you have completed all the course work at your current institution, you will then submit the final full transcript to FIU. You need to ask your current institution to send over your transcripts now, which would be the partial ones.",

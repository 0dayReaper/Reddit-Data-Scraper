    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'll be going to FIU for grad school and need to find an apartment before classes start. In your opinion and past experience, where should I look for affordable and relatively close-to-campus housing without having to go live somewhere I might get stabbed? my budget barely surpasses the 1000 dollar mark per month and I know it may be a longshot but could I realistically live by myself with this budget? I am a foreigner so I pretty much know nothing about this. thanks in advance",

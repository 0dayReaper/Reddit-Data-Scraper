    "postText": "Hello I am I High School Senior who has been admitted to FIU and will be starting during the Summer term of June 15th. I was originally confused as to why I was placed in the Summer term and not the Spring term but eventually understood as to why I got moved.\n\nThat being said, I still have a lot of questions I would like to hear from anyone (especially those who have taken or are taking ME courses) about their current experiences.\n\n  \nWhat is the difference between the Summer term A and Summer term B? (I've heard these two thrown around but im still confused about it.)\n\nCould an ME student explain the FIU Mechanical Engineering for Undergrad flow tree is supposed to work in a simplified manner. (It comes off as a bit daunting, but I think I understand it for the most part)\n\nWhat is the average campus life experience? (especially for that of an ME student)\n\nAny Clubs of interest? (ME perferably but anyone can suggest :))\n\nAre there courses that aren't available during the Summer Terms?\n\nWill my AP class still be accepted even if they come in later such as that of AP Physics of or ENC 1101 if I start in the summer term?\n\nI hope its not too much of a bothersome but it's these things that have me pondering.I might ask more question later if I feel the need.",

There are so many clubs but for ME check out Panther Motor Sports. They build race cars. There\u2019s also an internship with CRE2DO which is a NASA thing.",

            "comment": "The only real difference between Summer A and B is the start date. Summer A classes begin in May and end in June, while Summer B classes begin in June and end in July. Both terms are roughly six weeks long. \n\nI\u2019m not an ME major so I don\u2019t really know how to answer the other questions, sorry\u2026\n\nAlso for the AP credit, whenever you do you orientation and choose your classes, the advisor should ask you what AP credit you are anticipating to see if it transfers. That\u2019s how it was for me but if anything you should definitely let them know when you meet with them. Hope that helps :)",

            "comment": "Welcome!! The life of an ME student is filled with tons of studying lol especially once you get into your core classes. There are a lot of clubs depending on your interests, Panther robotics, ASE, and the one I highly recommend is SHPE (even if you\u2019re not Hispanic). As far as the flow chart, just make sure you\u2019re taking the basics (calculus, physics) and don\u2019t worry about the ME specific electives too much in the beginning, I\u2019m graduating in summer and my last semester is just electives so it\u2019s kinda nice. Club involvement is optimal, your future self looking for a job will thank you. But for now, just enjoy! You won\u2019t be in the engineering campus too much until your last 2 years then you won\u2019t go back to MMC for class. It really is just what you make it, have fun, learn how to study, and you\u2019ll be successful!",

It\u2019s not so much the day to day, just exam season. And all your friends will be on the same boat, studying becomes a part of your \u201csocial\u201d life. It\u2019s not very daunting, if you\u2019ve already taken DE, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a great student and this will come natural to you :)",

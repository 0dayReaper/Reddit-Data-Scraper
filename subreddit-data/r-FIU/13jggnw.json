For the girls only 16 private bedrooms were available and for males there were even less. I kind of assumed that there would be more private rooms available because of the amount of freshman dorming.",

If you wanted to get first dibs, you would\u2019ve had to commit and submit your housing agreement early, because appointments were made based off of when the agreements were submitted",

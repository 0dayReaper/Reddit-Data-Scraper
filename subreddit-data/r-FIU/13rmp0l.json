Ive applied since march and the waiting is actually killing me, i havent signed up for any classes either so i havent been able to do my financial aid yet. Its just really frustrating, ive also heard of other people having to deny acceptances at other schools bc they are still waiting back to hear from fiu. Does anyone know whats going on and why its taking so long?? i heard people last year heard back by may 15 and im just getting worried :/",

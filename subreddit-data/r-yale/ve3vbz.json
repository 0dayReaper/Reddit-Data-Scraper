            "comment": "The biggest downside to DS imo is that it does not leave a huge amount of academic space for you to explore your freshman year. It will take up 6 of the 8 or 9 courses that you will be taking. If you also then do a language requirement, you could conceivably not take any other courses. If you know you are going to stick in the humanities, this is not a huge issue but if you might be considering STEM/Social Science you might struggle to get your pre-reqs without being behind schedule. You can certainly plan around this but it is something you will need to keep in mind.",

As current students, would you mind letting me know how difficult this major is compared to other similar majors, such as Applied Math, CS and Math, Math, or CS?\n\nThanks for your help in advance!",

            "comment": "There are essentially no mandatory difficult (or even high workload) courses in the S&amp;DS major. It's very popular as a double major for people interested in signaling that they have quantitative skills as a result.\n\nFWIW, the difficulty/workload ranking for the majors you listed is probably something like:\n\n* Difficulty: Math &gt; Math/CS &gt; CS &gt; Applied Math &gt; S&amp;DS\n* Workload: CS &gt; Math/CS &gt; Math &gt; Applied Math &gt; S&amp;DS\n\nWith the caveat that any of these majors can be made quite difficult / intensive if you push yourself to take the hardest classes.",

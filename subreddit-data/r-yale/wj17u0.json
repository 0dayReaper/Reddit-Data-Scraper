I used to do Taekwondo back in middle school and high school, but I quit a few years ago after getting my black belt because I wanted to focus more on school.\n\nI miss Taekwondo and I would like to know if there are any good Taekwondo centers at Yale or in New Haven. I'd also like to hear opinions / experiences from current Yalies who may have participated at these centers. Thanks.",

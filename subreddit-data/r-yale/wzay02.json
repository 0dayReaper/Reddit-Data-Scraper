    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman and I just finished camp Yale (I did foot). Over the first few days and then my foot trip, I definitely met some cool people and I had no problem starting a conversation. Unfortunately, I didn't really become \"friends\" with anybody yet, I just have a good number of decent acquaintances I only spoke to once or twice.\n\nMy foot trip was good and I definitely got closer with the people on it, but none of them are in my residential college and we aren't really close enough that I would offer to go get a meal with some of them or anything.\n\nI'm going to join activities and I hope to meet some people I can make friends with there, but I'm kinda anxious because everybody seems to already have groups of people that they go around with and I don't want to be the only one walking around and eating alone.\n\nEverybody just still seems like a stranger, even if I have talked with them multiple times.",

Strike up some casual chat. The afternoon of move-in day, I ended up getting a good 8-10 people in my Old Campus building tossing around, and we grabbed dinner at our res college afterwards.\n\nAnother thing you can do: plan something informal at your suite, like a movie or a game night, and spread the word when you come across someone else in your building. Trust me, others are just as interested in meeting new people as you are.",

We introduce ourselves but eventually go our separate ways. I've got plenty of people I say hi to as I walk past, but I'm not sure how to transition from acquaintance to friend, which is really the issue I'm having.",

As long as you put yourself out there - go to parties, do extracurriculars, attend class and chat with your classmates (do what college students do) - it'll all happen organically. You'll have a close circle of friends before you know it.",

Honestly, I got to know quite a few friends by chatting up familiar faces from classes, friends of friends, etc. in places like dining halls, despite the initial awkwardness sometimes. If you really want to increase your chances of finding your groups, I suggest putting yourself out there to an almost comical degree. Besides the occasional awkward conversation, you have little to lose especially in your first year, with everyone pretty receptive to random encounters. \n\nIncidentally, after reading your post again, I think you may want to consider starting with the people you already know. For example, even if you don't find yourself clicking with your fellow FOOTies, you may find a new friend or two among their friends. Ditto for folks you meet in clubs: don't feel afraid to ask to grab or join a meal! In my experience, most people at Yale are nicer than they look, so really, don't be afraid to take some risks socially. The whole process definitely takes effort besides for the fortunate few who luck into their groups from day one.",

I'm in one club that's really great and I like all the people there but I just can't force myself to actually be myself and stop acting like I have to impress them or be super proper around them. I'm on a sports team but the team culture is a little bit toxic and although I really like some of the people there, some of them I'm not so fond of. I just really wish I could find at least a few people who I feel like I can just fully relax around like my friends from high school. Also I'm worried all my other friends from high school are making tons of new friends at their colleges and I'll be left behind\n\nAlso now that I feel like I'm \"settled in\" mostly, I'm worried nothing will really change.",

So many people feel the same way as you now. Speaking from experience don\u2019t fret :)",

If you want to talk more with the people you know, chances are they won't mind talking more with you, just ask! I know it's not easy, but take some pressure off yourself, put yourself out there, and leave the rest to the powers that may be. Loneliness can really take a toll at a place like Yale, which tends to favor extroverts, so don't be afraid of overdoing the socializing even past your comfort levels, especially in your first year.",

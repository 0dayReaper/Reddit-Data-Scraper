    "postText": "Hey! Can any current CS students give opinions on the comp sci curriculum / research + internship opportunities / class quality / overall experience here at Yale? I'm debating between this, UCLA, and Georgia Tech and am not sure if Yale's overall brand can justify the higher cost than the other two (which have somewhat better CS according to us news ranking, but those rankings are stupid so I don't actually know which are better). \n\nHave students had good placements into grad school / jobs straight out of undergrad, and does the curriculum prepare you enough for job interviews, etc.? Thanks in advance!",

If you were capable of getting admitted to Yale, you will get a good software job no matter where you go. It should under no circumstances be a factor in your decision making.\n\nGrad school is a different story -- if you already know that you have a clear interest in eventually completing a top CS PhD, then this is at least a plausible reason to investigate the relative strength of undergraduate programs. I wasn't a CS major (did math instead), but my impression was that most of my research-inclined friends had an easy time finding professors to work with once they'd gotten through the early core classes.",

Yale CS is good but its low ranked because its tiny. \n\nI don't really think Yale is the ideal school for someone who is 100% on the STEM team tbh but that's up for you to decide and definitely don't let name brand be the final decision - you live at your college for four years 24/7, don't prioritise 6 months or so of job searching over that!",

I'm looking into Economics, so I'm trying to justify what would make Yale a better decision versus say Northwestern. And by extension, what makes Yale Econ different from other departments/better than other departments in your subjective opinion.",

What makes being a Yale student subjectively better than being any other kind of student.",

Firstly to clarify when I said what makes a Yale student subjectively better, I was asking more of like why did you pick Yale, and secondly I find it great that you rally talk about brand name and not being afraid to base some of my reasoning off of brand bame. I\u2019ve basically spent the past 2-3 years essentially being told I\u2019m a fuckwad because I based some of my reason to transfer based on name. Banking and Management Consulting are 100% on the table and something I\u2019m actively striving for which is another reason for Yale. Like I really do think the Yale brand name stretches as far as the imagination and whether I\u2019m working on Wall Street or commuting to the Atlanta office I\u2019m going to gain a lot from Yale. I guess ultimately, I\u2019m just scared that I won\u2019t stack up when comparing to the other transfer applicants, especially since Yale\u2019s pool is so small, I\u2019m trying to find reasons besides prestige to keep Yale on my list vs. playing it safe.",

    "postText": "TL;DR: Anyone in the dmv area know best way to go about getting a swe role using Yale experience in CS and EE so that I can support fam at home/use that experience to transition to bigger companies\n\nSpent the last 4 years studying CS and EE(joint major with a focus on robotics) only to find that the industry is much more niche than I thought and very hard to get into. I did research and gov't IT contracting internships over my summers because I was just focusing on classes and didn't understand how important internships were. Everyone said u learn on the job and I thought the Yale name would get me in the door but that doesn't seem to be the case. I'd keep grinding for an opportunity in robotics but have found out a most companies in my area(Virginia) are just gov't contractors that just abuse international students status and overwork them/culture is much very toxic compared to other industries so going through a massive career crisis right now.\n\nHoping to pivot into SWE but companies only seem to invest in potential during internships and Yale name doesn't mean much relative to experience. SWE also seems oversaturated right now and economy is terrible too so not a lot of opportunities. Thought i'd be fine cause friends were going through the same thing but just realized they have family connections to get them in and i'm FGLI so not an option for me.\n\nAnyone here know of any software companies in the dmv that take chances on underrepresented new grads/programs that make it easier to get a foot in so that I can then grind to keep my spot?

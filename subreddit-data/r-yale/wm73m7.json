            "comment": "\\- Reading week takes place before finals period in December/May. I think you mean Fall Break. And you can stay on campus if you wish (dorms and libraries will of course be open, and some dining halls should remain open), it'll be pretty evenly split between people going home/travelling or staying on campus. Most freshmen who don't live within driving distance to Yale will probs stay on campus, though many people take little day trips to New York or visit their friends who live nearby. Don't worry about it too much yet!\n\n\\- Thanksgiving break is the entire week of Thanksgiving. This includes Harvard-Yale which is the Saturday before Thanksgiving. Usually, people arrive at Harvard on Friday afternoon, stay overnight (if you don't have friends at Harvard and don't want to pay for accomodations, your residential college will almost certainly make accomodations for you to stay with some Harvard student or in the common room of a Harvard House, and many extracurricular activities also provide housing through their matching group at Harvard), and then leave on Saturday afternoon or Sunday morning. The big partying night is Friday, and the actual game should be done on Saturday by like 3pm. I'd recommend getting your flights out of Boston, yes.",

    "postText": "Hi! I am in incoming freshman hoping to pursue biomedical engineering and be on the pre-med track. The courses I plan to take in the fall are CHEM 161 (+ discussion section), CHEM 134L , MATH 112, and CHINESE 130 . Also one note: I am not the biggest fan of writing so I am trying to take the least amount of writing classes as possible, which is why I currently only have QR, SC and L courses. If anyone has any advice about that or about my courseload please let me know!!",

A lot of them fall into the genre of humanities and social sciences, offering a survey/unique exploration of random topics that don't fall into the category of \"core knowledge\" for any given major. I was not particularly interested in any of them because I like classes more oriented towards STEM (there is a small number of seminars in this category but they also didn't appeal to me) and prefer to learn such arbitrary things just by reading on my own, so I didn't take one. Granted, you could take one to knock out a credit for one of your core requirements. All but one of my roommates took one, though, and enjoyed the experience, so I would still recommend trying one out during the add/drop period of your first or second semester.",

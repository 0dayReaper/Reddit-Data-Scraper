    "postText": "I\u2019m a prefrosh who just finished Bulldog Days, and just have to say thank you to all of the wonderful people I met on campus!\n\nI never ate alone, even in dining halls where I didn\u2019t know anyone. Some Yalies would always take pity on me and invite me to sit with them. \n\nMy hosts were amazing, but I found plenty of wonderful Yalies while sitting in common rooms or in classrooms or on park benches as well. Students would recognize the BDD bracelet on my wrist and introduce themselves to me and offer to talk to me about my major or show me around. \n\nEven more than being kind, every Yalie I met was thoughtful and non-judgmental, even when I was nervous and stuttering through the day. Not every conversation was about quantum physics or objective morality, but I walked away from every conversation having learned something new. Even better, I felt like the Yalies I talked to wanted to listen and learn from me too. \n\nI don\u2019t know how many of you guys I saw out there, but I\u2019m sure that all of you contribute to the warm atmosphere I felt on campus that cut through the New Haven rain. So thank you to all of you reading, and I can\u2019t wait to see you as a student.",

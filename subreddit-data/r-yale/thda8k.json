    "postText": "I was recently accepted to the PH school and I'm super excited to be attending in the fall. When I started telling people, everyone that I know that attended Yale (undergrad + grad) has only told me incredible things. They only speak very positively about their experiences at Yale. \n\nI went to Columbia for undergrad and the common sentiment has been that the Columbia experience was mediocre at best (only light was NYC). And, this was also shared with me when I was accepted into Columbia for the same program. I ultimately chose Yale because of this. \n\nBut, I'm wondering, am I just hearing selective opinions? Can it be that being a student at Yale is on average a positive experience?",

If your professors, fellow students, and others treat you well, and you're respected and well-supported, then you'll do well. Same goes for the city--I personally really enjoyed living in New Haven, but that's because I found the people and places there that I enjoy; that's true for any person in any city.\n\nIt's completely normal to have doubts and \"what if\" questions after making an important decision. But you can only ask \"Yale vs. Columbia?\" because the more meaningful questions require you to actually live and work at the place for a while. This will all work itself out in time.",

            "comment": "Your Yale alum friends may have been trying to be encouraging. That\u2019s not to say their experience at Yale wasn\u2019t positive, I\u2019m sure it was. I\u2019m just saying they probably left out what they disliked about Yale or New Haven or their Yale experience might have been beautified after having been away for some time (nostalgia). I also think the bad things about this place aren\u2019t bad enough to be worth mentioning.\nI\u2019m a current grad student and in my experience, Yale has been overall great. That might be because I came in with realistic expectations, though. I think most of the professors are great in one way or the other - great lectures or just really friendly and helpful. Most students are friendly and the rest just keep to themselves. I haven\u2019t met anyone who\u2019s just plain mean and out to get you. I personally think campus is beautiful. \nIf you want to hear the cons, I can give you a few: (a) I just don\u2019t like New England weather. I don\u2019t want to be the person that complains about the weather because there\u2019s really not a lot of places in the world with great weather all throughout the year, but I feel like it just randomly rains often and the wind is pretty strong, making it colder than it really is. \n(b) I\u2019m also pretty weary of anyone on the street who isn\u2019t a student - it\u2019s pretty stupid, I know they\u2019re just living their lives and there\u2019s supposed to be locals everywhere anyways. Technically, it\u2019s us students that are \u201cstrangers\u201d to the locals since we come, stay a few years, then graduate and leave. I just feel unsafe when I see thrifters and all. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing compared to NYC, though. \n(c) So hard to find an apartment with in unit laundry, covered parking, or even just AC. I know these apartments exist, but there are very few. Apartments with ACs are fairly easy to find, but not a default. I imagine it\u2019s pretty much the same or worse in NYC.\n(d) Safety issues do come up. Mostly robbery. Car/home break-ins. But again, compared to NYC\u2026 I really think New Haven\u2019s reputation of bad crime rates is exaggerated. This is nothing for people who have lived in Baltimore or Berkeley.\nConclusion: Yeah, I basically don\u2019t have any issues with Yale itself. It\u2019s just New England I don\u2019t like. And compared to NYC, it\u2019s definitely definitely much more affordable to live here. If you\u2019re not crazy about always having fun things to do in the city, then I think you\u2019ll find New Haven a chill place to live.",

Your experience as a grad student will be different than that of an undergrad. \n\nPersonally, I came to Yale hopelessly enamored but the rose-colored glasses have come away bit by bit. My professors and classes are on the whole, fantastic and I do not have many complaints from an educational standpoint. The students are, on average, not very impressive; they are routinely put on a pedestal that rather few deserve, in my opinion. The university as an entity itself is pretty atrocious. It\u2019s run very much like a corporation, and I do not feel cared about as a student here. I have friends who share all of these sentiments, and I also know people who would disagree with me and cherish their experience here very much. I believe that this is a pretty common experience at top schools (and most schools, for that matter) so I think you should expect a similar experience to Columbia. New Haven is nothing like NYC, though.\n\nEdit: found the people who disagree with me \ud83e\udd2a",

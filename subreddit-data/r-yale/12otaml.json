    "postText": "I\u2019m considering Brown, UPenn, Harvard, and Yale. Brown and Yale are my favs bc they seem the chillest by far. I have always considered them to be my top two and loved both when I visited. Brown seems to be better for general mental well-being with the open curriculum, lack of GPA, etc. but Yale is YALE with what seems to be equally chill/cool students and a prestigious reputation. The only issue is that its curriculum and academic culture seem to be more rigid and competitive.  I was at Brown\u2019s admitted students day on Friday and absolutely loved it and could see myself there. I have yet to attend Bulldog Days but kinda assume that I\u2019ll feel the same way about Yale. My concern with Brown is its loose curriculum and grading system disadvantaging me post-grad (I plan on applying to law school and money is a priority of mine lol). And with Yale I just worry that I\u2019ll feel restricted academically and be less happy. Should I pick Brown for the sake of the open curriculum and pass up on the prestige that a school like Yale/Harvard offers OR do you all feel like the workload and curriculum at Yale still allows you to thrive and be happy/social?",

            "comment": "Brown and Yale alumni tend to love their schools for the quality of their experience, (i.e. culture, overall happiness, friends, etc.) They also tend to be less obsessed with prestige and rankings, which really seems to matter most to ultra-competitive high schoolers and their parents. The academic culture at Yale is not very rigid (the distribution requirements are minimal and are mostly covered just by taking classes that interest you (as long as you have broad interests/curiosity). The culture is also not terribly more competitive than at Brown, but Yale being Yale probably has a higher % of prestige-minded students than Brown, but less than Harvard or UPenn. Brown probably has a higher percentage of students who are drawn to it because it has an openly advertised chill vibe and open curriculum. In terms of resources, Yale is substantially stronger than Brown, but you can have an absolutely outstanding undergrad experience with manageable workloads at both. No wrong choice here.",

            "comment": "Graduated last year. Yale didn\u2019t feel that competitive tbh. Definitely flexibility to explore and take weird classes while maintaining a very active social life too. You get a set amount of Credit/D/Fail classes (i think it\u2019s 4?) just for that. Even prestige aside, if I were to do it all over again I would still choose Yale over any other school just for the experience and the quality of people you encounter",

Relative \u201cprestige\u201d at that level doesn\u2019t really matter unless you\u2019re gunning for tier 1a finance jobs\u2026\n\nNot sure what grade inflation is like at Yale, but it\u2019s pretty ridiculous at Brown (as in I\u2019d say the mode is a 4.0 lol), which helps a lot for law school admissions.",

Going into the process I had romanticized Brown because of the open curriculum and \u201cchill vibe.\u201d Yale doesn\u2019t have an open curriculum, but I have actually enjoyed the academic exploration I\u2019ve done for my distributional requirement. Also, Yale has a very chill subculture if that\u2019s what you like about Brown. Art shows and readings, amateur comedy and music, just all around cool people \u2014 though perhaps a bit pretentious (but I think artsy people at all ivies are kind of like that).\n\nI don\u2019t regret coming to Yale at all. Such an amazing school with so many great opportunities, and I\u2019ve made amazing friends.",

            "comment": "Remember to post on Brown as well. As a grad student graduating from Yale, TAed and taught my own undergrad classes there recently, I feel that Yale is really not a tough school. For undergrads, there are tons of sources, like library, writing group, tutors, etc, to help you succeed. Btw, we have 2 week spring break (Harvard has only one)\u2014truly become a holiday. Forget to mention: I feel grade inflation is real across Yale. Just my five cents. If I were you, go for Yale!",

I'm a homeschooled student really interested in applying and I wanted to know any homeschooled students' experiences, both with the application process and studying at Yale in general!  I've read up on Yale's articles for homeschooled applicants which were incredibly helpful, but I would love to hear about any personal experience as well.  Thank you so much, really appreciate it :)",

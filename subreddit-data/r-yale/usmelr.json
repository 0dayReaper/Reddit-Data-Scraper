    "postText": "Hi, incoming YSM grad student here. What are the cheapest ways to find housing in and around Yale, that are not in dangerous areas? \nI do not mind many roommates, small rooms, religious organizations, sharing apartment with elderly, whatever it takes. We get a small stipend, but with health insurance for international students and moving, we don't have that much money left. \nAny advice appreciated.",

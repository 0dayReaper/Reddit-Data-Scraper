Lunch at Schwartzman, which is one of the only places you would have access to as a graduate student, costs roughly $15 for one meal. It also doesn't even have the option for breakfast/dinner. Most graduate students live off campus and prepare meals at home if they are trying to save money. Apologies if this comes off harshly, but I have to say choosing a graduate school based solely on this niche way of working and saving money is pretty moronic.",

I was hoping to do on campus living as a grad student by doing the coop in undergrad dorms thru one of their weird grad school living policies to save money; im not choosing a grad school based off food, im choosing it based on my other variables that ive already compared, the last one is dining options since money is at the end of the day my biggest issue, i was asking originally to see if yale had good cost-taste in terms of food since im prob gonna work 2 jobs like in undergrad and wont be able to cook as much as id prefer since i also have to pay my sisters tuitions :|",

Is there anything I can do to increase my chances? \n\nI\u2019m a first-gen international applicant (QC Canada) 21F who graduated high school in 2019, &amp; I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t stand out because I\u2019m not a parent, business-owner or veteran. \n\nThe only \u201cstand-out\u201d thing about me is my 5 years of work experience (started in customer service and worked my way into car sales at a luxury brand, will be working part-time retail while I study this upcoming fall) and \u201cresilience\u201d (can I even say that about myself?) as I was (\u26a0\ufe0fTRIGGER WARNING\u26a0\ufe0f) badly attacked (no weapon, though) &amp; mugged at 15, and kicked out at 17. \n\nI had 90% average my first three years of high school, with involvement in student life and extracurriculars, as well as competing in track &amp; field and attending academic programs (Summer@Brown for Immunology, Invitation-Only Canada Math Camp at University of Toronto, CEMC Workshop at University of Waterloo) but the \u201cincident\u201d occurred and I had to attend physical therapy for a year and mental therapy for several years following. My last two years of high school were hard to juggle family issues, concussion, extreme bullying (I had to do my last year of high school at a school two towns over to escape the bullies) and my average tanked to low to mid 80s. \n\nThis fall, I'm attending a local university to showcase my academic abilities by taking college/university-level courses (Chemistry, Cal 2, Physics, and English) I'm also studying hard for the SAT, and I'm confident that I can achieve the 90s I used to get. (I\u2019ll also take part in student life and the varsity Track &amp; Field team)\n\nThank you!",

As with every other part of your application, the interview doesn't make or break your chances of admission, but it does serve the purpose of being a footnote that can have a real impact. The interview tells admissions anything they might not have gotten from your file: academics, personality, intellectual curiosity, stuff like that, which can be useful, but again--it's not going to make or break you. It can be especially useful to have a good interview if you're on the bubble for acceptance, FYI.\n\nAlso, the interview is your way of demonstrating how sincere your interest in the school is, and it's a way to tell you about the school and hopefully encourage you to matriculate if accepted.\n\nBTW: I've noticed that there are a lot of YouTube videos about people reading their admissions files and commenting on how their letters and interview reports were weighed. Some people got in who had low interview scores, some got in who had stellar scores. BUT: do not trust everything on YouTube. Duh.",

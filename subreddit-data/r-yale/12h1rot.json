    "postText": "Hello! My sister was admitted to Yale and Stanford. If my sister does decide to go to Yale, she will be majoring in MCDB on the pre-med track! My sister is worried about the opportunities and research for MCDB and feels like Stanford has a stronger premed program. My question is what is premed like at Yale? Is it easy to find research opportunities and get support? Thank you!",

            "comment": "Undergraduate STEM research at Yale is *very* accessible (and well-funded), especially in biology. It's as easy as cold-emailing professors whose research you find interesting. There is definitely no shortage of professors, and it's definitely not hard to get involved in research.\n\nAs for the pre-med program in general, Yale offers all the requisite courses. The pre-med culture here is typical of most pre-meds at other universities\u2014very driven, competitive, and occasionally toxic vibes\u2014but it's decidedly more chill while maintaining academic rigor.\n\nHope this helps! The Stanford/Yale choice has many dimensions, and it's not an easy decision to make.",

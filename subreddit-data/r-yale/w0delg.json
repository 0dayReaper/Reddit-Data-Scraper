    "postText": "Hey everyone! I was looking for some help to choose courses for my first semester.\n\nMy areas of interest are Physics/Astronomy and Computer Science\n\nFor my first semester, I will take PHYS 180 or 200 along with MATH 115 (I placed into this). I studied mechanics and electricity/magnetism in 11th and 12th grade, so which PHYS course would be the best for me?\n\nI am a bit confused about my 3rd course. \n\nShould I go for science? Either CPSC 100 or ASTR 160. Will CPSC100 be too intense?\n\nOr in humanities/QR: PHIL 115 (First order logic) or ENGL 123 (Creative Writing)\n\nI am also thinking of ART 120 (wood sculpture) as my 4th course.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

            "comment": "In terms of PHYS 180 vs 200, I took both AP Physics Cs with 5s but chose to take 180 anyways to make my first year workload lower, though I've heard of many people going the other route, too. I would attend the first few classes of both and see what seems more interesting/manageable for you. \n\nI skipped CS 100 because I had prior programming experience, but I've heard good things about the course, though the workload will be pretty high.\n\nOverall, I would recommend trying some courses outside you major area (like that art course) to get a feel for Yale and keep your course load manageable for you first year. Also definitely check reviews and ratings on course table if you haven't already.",

The Yale site says that usually MATH 120 and PHYS200 are taken together, so maybe it's better if I do PHYS180.\n\nI also have prior programming experience with Python (as well as HTML/CSS/some JS and SQL). I guess I won't learn as much in CS100 but yeah I would have to do the PSETS, in addition to the Physics and Math Psets which could become very difficult in my first semester.\n\nBut yeah I don't want to overload my first semester (I have to take 165L i think as well).",

Also, they use pretty basic multi in PHYS 200, so I wouldn't worry too much about it. My roommate took Math 115 alongside PHYS 200, and he did just fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing I will restate is that CS100 is an enriching experience but a serious time commitment. I took multi first semester, so I'm not too familiar with the workload of MATH 115, but I think you'll just have to see how it is for you. Again, I've listed an alternative in the linked post, so feel free to check it out if you don't think CS100 is right for you.",

She never releases the cutoffs for specific grades, though, like an A. The only thing I would watch out for is the fact that the grading on psets can get a bit annoying. Your code can be working fine, but if you have redundancies in your code or haven't done it the way she specified, points will be taken off (these types of \"errors\" are obviously harder to spot because they won't affect your code's ability to run). She gives these \"good coding style\" tips in slide lectures that aren't actually just tips. You need to follow them to a T. I would just remember that working code doesn't necessarily mean it's the best code, and you may be doing unnecessary things in your code, so after finishing a problem set, be sure to check it over a few times, make sure you've followed the problem's specification, check that you've followed the \"rules\" listed in the slides, and go to Beth's office hours because she always notified me of errors that I wouldn't have picked up on myself. Also, start the problem sets early. This goes for any CS class at Yale, even CS50. These problem sets are designed to make you sit and think for a bit, and sometimes you just need to leave and come back to a problem. I had previous coding experience and was able to finish them all in about an hour and a half or less, but I would check my work over several times in the days leading up to the due date. I took the course in the spring, and I think the curve may be better if you take the course in the fall because in the spring, a good amount of people come and take the class after CS50 and have some coding experience behind them. The reviews for classes from last semester haven't been posted on CourseTable yet, but when they do, I suggest you check them out as well.",

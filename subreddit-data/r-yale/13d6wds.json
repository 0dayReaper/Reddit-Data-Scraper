    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm a high school senior planning to start my Yale experience in the fall, but I now realize that I have nothing to do this summer. I was too focused on college applications to apply to summer programs earlier this year, and since I live a pretty rural area (and want to get the hell out), there aren't many work or research opportunities nearby.\n\nBesides First-Year Scholars, are there any other programs open to **incoming freshmen** that would **let me leave my (boring) home** for the summer and which are **free/cheap**? I just don't have the money to pay for housing, and **I doubt I could qualify for much financial aid**. I'm open to anything including:\n\n* Studying abroad\n* Doing research\n* Getting started on my Yale coursework\n\nThanks in advance!",

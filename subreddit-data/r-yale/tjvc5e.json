You won't be able to get into the residential college grounds or some of the academic buildings without a school ID, but most of the buildings will be open during daytime hours for a walkthrough.",

The main libraries are quite secure and so you won't be able to go to any of those, but you'd be able to visit residential colleges, their libraries, classroom buildings etc far more easily.",

Without college access you\u2019re only able to get into around 50% of the campus (and less without any ID). \n\nBeinecke fortunately is now open to the public. If you\u2019re with your family I\u2019d also recommend the YUAG and YCBA (Yale art galleries) if you\u2019re with your family. They\u2019re great.",

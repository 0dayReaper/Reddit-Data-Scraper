In this vein, the college with the most apathy among their students is probably Saybrook (but there are upsides to Saybrook too)\n\nHonestly not sure why people are saying Stiles. Its probably been the highlight of my Yale experience. I\u2019ve found a lot of people who shit on it haven\u2019t actually been inside the spaces, and are surprised to see they\u2019re modern and beautiful. It\u2019s also way less stuffy than some of the more legacy filled ones.",

I think calling any college the worst sets up people to be disappointed with their res college when they all have pros and cons.\n\nThat being said, my general rankings are\n\nBetter colleges: Pauli Murray, Franklin, Silliman, JE, Saybrook, Berkeley, Branford\n\nWorse Colleges: Hopper, Trumbull, Davenport, Pierson, TD, Stiles, Morse",

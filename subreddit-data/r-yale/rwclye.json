They\u2019re just covering their asses. Because everyone is going to get Omicron (sorry, COVID hawks). Get vax, stay home if sick, and relax - I think the bigger worry for most of us is fighting back social capital concerns among friends when it comes to stuff like this",

Why are todays students so easily manipulated and controlled? I was at a large state university only a few years ago - and we wouldn\u2019t have masked for 5 minutes - let alone told not to gather (party) for any duration of time. It\u2019s amazing to me how much young \u201crebellious\u201d people have become obedient conformists in the face of absurd Covid policies",

Usually they dance around which I get--managing a campus beats bet hedging and loose language into you. But just before the break, we received an unusually clear answer that was then contradicted mere hours later in the university-wide email",

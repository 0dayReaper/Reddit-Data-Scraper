We are far from the (High Street) frats, the art buildings, and Old Campus. We are close to Science Hill, the Political Science building, the Computer Science building, and some of the biggest lecture halls on campus. Most everything else is a 5-10 minute walk. \u201cFar from campus\u201d means that when you have friends in Branford telling you they want to do something social, at 5:30, you leave at 5:15 while everyone else rolls out at 5:28.",

I\u2019d go there more if I wasn\u2019t in one of the old colleges, it\u2019s too far of a walk to be worth it for me.\n\nalso having elevators is huge, move ins and move outs will be so much better than in the old colleges",

IMO it\u2019s the best residential college at Yale.\n\n\u2014 Best dining hall\n\u2014 Best gym\n\u2014 Solid buttery\n\u2014 Access to Murray facilities thru underground (Murray buttery is the best)\n\u2014 spacious suites with AC\n\u2014 very well liked Head/Dean combo (I\u2019ve heard only limited things tho)\n\u2014 Compact layout with 3 courtyards\n\u2014 Closer to central campus than Murray (still kinda far) and still close to the stem areas.  Also close to Yale Health.\n\u2014 no mold like on old campus means you won\u2019t have the Yague as bad\n\nI also have a lot of friends in Franklin.  I would sell a kidney to be in Franklin.",

These courses are also offered in the summer but you miss the magic of the course because of the fast pace, so I only recommend taking them during the academic year. Astro 120 with Faison was an amazing experience. If I could change my major I\u2019d change it to Astronomy. The class is not easy, but it is highly, highly rewarding. Life changing if you let it!",

She's such a lovely person too and really cares about making connections with students.",

And if you aren\u2019t a CS major but have an interest in it, CS50 is a fun course where you\u2019ll learn a lot.",

    "postText": "I'm a freshman and I've been feeling like I just wish I could be back with all my high school friends and family again. I've met some super nice people, but they're all still just acquaintances to me at this point, and I feel behind because everyone else seems closer than I am to their new friends. I don't know how to stop using a persona and start feeling like I can just be myself and relax around all these new people. I don't even enjoy talking with people most of the time, it feels like a chore, unlike talking with my family/friends. Does this go away?",

If you can, try to join some clubs within your interests and outside those of your roommates/suite mates. This provides a low-stakes environment for you to socialize and gives you the chance to meet likeminded people. These feelings get better with time.",

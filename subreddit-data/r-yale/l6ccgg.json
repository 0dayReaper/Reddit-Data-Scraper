Which colleges have the most resources? Best support/dean? If you were forced to transfer residential colleges, where would you go?\n\nMe personally, I'm a big fan of Siliman. great food, good life center, location, dorms",

They have the most money to spend on students.\n\nFacilities/grounds: While Silliman and the new colleges get high marks for objective facilities, I still can\u2019t help but strongly dislike their aesthetic. It doesn\u2019t feel \u201cYale\u201d to me. Prettiest goes to JE.\n\nSupport/Dean: honestly don\u2019t know, have never really used my college Dean for much quite frankly. Maybe Silliman. I heard a lot of people used to love the old Dean (?) of hopper before she left Yale.\n\nTransfer: gun to my head, I would transfer to Berkeley or Hopper. The non-XC colleges just don\u2019t feel the same to me. Too new, not enough weathered stone.",

For example, JE Frocos get a higher budget for hosting duty than some other colleges, as each college chooses how much to allocate. In addition, JE can in theory fund more activities such as festivals, trips,etc. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a major difference, but there is potential. A lot comes down to HoC and Dean. The new colleges have also been given more funding than others to help ease the process of creating a college culture.",

                            "comment": "This comes from very personal observations, but Silliman has the absolute best location and a combination of high-tier student support, facilities, and community. \n\nThere is quite no better location than SM. One way you look into Hillhouse Avenue, a beautiful street that houses so many departments at Yale. The other way you are next to Cross Campus which is the central point for undergrads for nearly all four years. It is close enough to Whitney Ave but not detached from the Old Campus-adjacent colleges, so that you don't have to hike whenever you go to a party like Franklin/Murray people do. You have a nearby coffeeshop (and formerly a pizza place), etc.\n\nI argue that this ends up being the most important factor because frankly your experiences with how good student support or the community is are highly subjective and not worth arguing over. I will say that SM admin shows its support through stories of how HoC Santos helps individual Sillimanders I know, how the Acorn is up and running, how the SM common room is used every summer for storage so each student gets to store 4 personal boxes, and how there are many initiatives related to sustsinability that begin from Silliman. Now I can also say that this is unfair to other colleges: SM has the space to host the Acorn and the Good Life Center. That leads to my next point about facilities. I think BF, MY, ES, and MC all have the best facilities, but the new colleges dance studios are not student run and force people to book way in advance. Stiles Morse are a maze to get through, and it is not a place where people who don't live there would naturally come to hang out/study. Their location once again factors in how as a student I experience their facilities. I have for so many times taken a nap at the Sandbox because it is just so convenient and actually quiet. \n\nThe food at SM is not special: the new colleges have weekly specialties and pizzas, Branford and JE throw food events every now and then, Berkeley Stiles Morse have outstanding pizzas. Silliman has none of these, but somehow their food is really reliable for me. The dining hall is also where I can most likely catch Professors (I am an engineering major). Other facilities like the dance studio are nothing exceptional, but their location and student-run nature make it so that I end up being there for my dance practice all the time.\n\nI will say that each college has something that you will discover to love. I am from Branford, and I have grown to LOVE our digital media studio where I get to do Illustrator on their computer while I do Photoshop on mine. Our architecture is insane, and I have also found a group of friends that I always feel so lucky to be part of. Head De La Cruz is amazing and I have benefited immensely from having Ozan Say, the advisor for all international students, be in Branford.\n\nBut I would be lying if I say I never wish our entire first-year Froco group was placed in Silliman.",

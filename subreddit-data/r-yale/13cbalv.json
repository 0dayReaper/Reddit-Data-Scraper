    "postText": "Hi all! I'm a pre-frosh looking to major in physics or astrophysics at Yale, but I'm not sure which introductory physics sequence would be best for me, 200/201 or 260/261. In high school, I took Calculus BC and some multivariable, as well as Physics C Mech (but not E&amp;M). Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

            "comment": "260/261 is definitely the \"physics major\" sequence - I would say that most people that major in physics / astrophysics take it as did I.\n\nYou will be well-prepared with Physics C Mechanics and some multivariable, but perhaps a bit behind without Physics C E&amp;M, so one thing I'd highly recommend is to take Multivariable (Math 120) at the same time since a lot of the applied Multivariable will help you understand the E&amp;M which is a fair bit more advanced than what you'd do in high school.",

Loved them and got comfortable A's in the process, but my peers who took 260/261 got so much \"farther\" simply because of the mathematic rigor you are exposed to. The truth is I was scared of the complex math part and decided against 260, but you're gonna need to be pretty good at math to get a BS in physics. Try shopping both and see if you feel comfortable enough with the math.",

    "postText": "I'm from eastern Europe and I wanna apply for Yale School of Arts. The thing is that I have no idea what to do and that's the reason why I have questions. First of all.. would it be possible for me? I'm 24 years old and even though I studied at the university, I never got my Bachelor's degree. Can I still apply with scholarship? I'm an established designer, somewhat known in my field, would it make it easy for me to apply, or would it make things worse since I never got my degree?",

            "comment": "\u201cThe School of Art requires for admission a high degree of capability and commitment. Applicants must hold a bachelor\u2019s degree from an accredited college or university or a diploma from a four-year accredited professional art school. In exceptional cases and most particularly in light of the differences among educational structures and opportunities in the international art world today, the admissions committee may waive these prerequisites if other proofs of preparation and accomplishment are deemed sufficient equivalents by the committee. In either case, admission to the School of Art is on a highly selective and competitive basis.\u201d  \n\n[https://www.art.yale.edu/apply/graduate-admission](https://www.art.yale.edu/apply/graduate-admission)",

Age is irrelevant, they only care about your skills and what you'll bring to the program. The biggest barrier is not having your bachelor's, that's likely going to make it an automatic rejection unless you're already extremely, extremely successful (in which case, why take time off from your work for an MFA?). Depending on what country you're from, you'll likely have to sit for a TOEFL exam as well. \n\nThe other big thing is, you need to have a really good reason for why you want to study at Yale, beyond \"because it's Yale\" or \"because it's the best.\" \n\nRe: scholarship, I'm not sure how Art does things, but I wouldn't get your hopes up if you have no bachelor's and had a low GPA. You also will likely have to take out private student loans rather than federal loans, if you're not a US citizen. \n\nIf your heart is really set on Yale, I'd recommend finishing your bachelor's and pulling up your GPA as a first step.",

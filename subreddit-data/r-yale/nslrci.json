It is a simple thing to understand: you dangerous bigots have identified a weakness in our enlightenment ethical framework and have become experts at exploiting it.\r  \n\r  \nYou are not a 'good person' for your racist provocations that no other culture would abide. All western countries combined are only 10% of global population. This woman is from a country that is, alone, more than all of europe and the diaspora combined. This is unacceptable and it reeks of genocide. The entire world is being taught that not only is this anti-white bigotry acceptable, but that they are allowed to come to this country, demand affirmative action, all while vocally calling for our deaths.\r  \n\r  \nStop being a neonazi-tier bigot.\r  \n\r\r  \n\rThis woman needs to be immediately removed from medical practice.

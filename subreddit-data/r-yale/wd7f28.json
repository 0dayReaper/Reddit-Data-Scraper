I've been singing on and off in choirs and like singing on my own time. I've never had to audition for a choir or singing group before, so I have no idea what to expect. Can anyone enlighten me?",

I'm an outsider but from listening to my friends' experiences it seems a bit intense. No clue about the Glee Club though",

            "comment": "I was in glee club and a cappella at Yale. I also served as pitchpipe (music director) in my junior year for my a cappella group. \n\nDon\u2019t worry if you\u2019ve never auditioned before. That\u2019s common\u2014plenty of people audition with something a simple as \u201chappy birthday\u201d or a pop song they learned by ear. In the audition, the pitch pipe (a cappella music director) or Glee Club director will also teach you little exercises to get a sense of your tone, range, musicality etc. No prep necessary for those. The audition environment should be very welcoming and warm; people of all experience levels should be welcome! If you find that the audition room felt \u201ccold\u201d for you or you didn\u2019t get the right vibe, then make note of it and use that experience to find the fit that\u2019s right for you!\n\nNote that unlike Glee Club, which is mostly about the audition, a cappella groups have a more complicated, weeks-long \u201crush\u201d process where they want to make sure you\u2019re a good social fit for the group (and vice versa) since they are also social organizations. Plus, some of the groups travel extensively throughout the year, so it\u2019s important to get along when sharing close quarters and exhausting schedules.\n\nEither way, I highly encourage you to audition as much as you feel comfortable\u2014even if you don\u2019t end up joining any group at all, it\u2019s a great way to meet tons of 2nd\u20134th-years really fast!",

            "comment": "hey! I'm in an SATB SGC group and a cultural a cappella group, and I was about the same level of commitment to singing as you going in.\n\nI'll be honest and say that the SGC groups are fairly competitive to get into, just because there's so many crazy good singers at Yale, but it shouldn't stop you from auditioning - I'd never really auditioned for anything in my life before, but I had a ton of fun singing with &amp; meeting so many people during rush, and it was really reassuring how out of their way most groups went to make me feel at home.\n\nas other ppl have said the SGC site has info on rush logistics, but I'm also happy to dm about any other questions you might have re rush / time commitments / group vibes! cheers\\~ \ud83d\ude01",

            "comment": "The two are not mutually exclusive, did both my first year. Different vibes for sure though. I suggest at least try the audition for both - you can always decide/drop later. In terms of competitiveness, varies for each year/voice parts needs. Some a cappella groups are much more competitive than others (up there YAC, OOTB etc.). For both YGC and a cappella though, audition includes some ear training, sightreading, solo of your choice, and blending exercise (depending on group, usually something from their own rep). If you do decide to rush (especially multiple groups), those two weeks are going to be crazy beyond imagination, be prepared :)",

    "postText": "I\u2019m trying to help find resources for a student who\u2019s recovering from an MTBI and generally deals with mental health struggles. The therapy they\u2019re getting atm isn\u2019t really sufficient due to it\u2019s infrequency and I figured there would be group sessions on campus that they could join. If anyone knows of resources that pertain to their situation and could share them on here it\u2019d be really helpful, thank you! :)",

All I really wanted was for this year to be normal, and...sigh.\n\nAnd I just don't really understand what going online for a few weeks accomplishes from a health perspective. Omicron is horrendously infectious, and it's not like it's gonna magically disappear when we get back.",

I'm sure it's logistically *way* easier for Yale the more of these cases happen off campus (e.g., isolation room capacity).\n\nStill...well, Omicron still isn't going to just disappear, a university is still going to be a congregate environment, and the nature of Omicron seems to be to spread like wildfire in congregate environments ([one only needs to look at Cornell](https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-outbreaks-disrupt-princeton-cornell-end-of-term-11639590864)).\n\nIn terms of a \"substantially reducing the aggregate number of student cases\" perspective, I'm not sure what being online for a couple weeks really accomplishes.\n\nEDIT: More generally, I'm not sure what a single-minded focus of cases really gets us at this point in an entirely boosted population...",

Sure we don't know exactly how omicron will shake out, and we'll have to play it by ear a bit, but this is a good policy decision to start. Also setting the first week online makes for a smoother transition in the scenario where they have to put the first half-semester online or something. It's my last year too, and it sucks, but these policies really are the smartest way to proceed given the uncertainty at hand.",

As someone who took an entire year off to avoid online school and knows many Yale students that had complete mental health crises last year, I hope for undergrads sake this ends up blowing over fairly quickly. The college is also gonna have a tough time stopping students mingling and partying considering it doesn\u2019t look like the country\u2019s going back into lockdown.",

Given it's much higher rate of transmission, a large outbreak during the school year could be really bad and potentially lead to some hospitalizations amongst the Yale body. We haven't had a chance to gather a lot of detailed info on omicron yet nor do we know how things are going to shake out in the coming weeks. A delay and preparations for extended time online is the safest course or action given the uncertainty.\n\nI am a graduate student, but I have also been a data scientist at the medical school for 5 years, have a background in epidemiology, and do research on covid including actively managing the Yale covid data explorer, so for what it's worth, my professional opinion is that this decision is in line with the science.",

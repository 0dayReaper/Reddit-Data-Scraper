    "postText": "I\u2019m interested in double majoring in two very different subjects, studio art and international relations. Someone on here told me that the difficulty and value of a double major depends on my majors. Does a double major in these fields seem plausible, and if so, how difficult? I\u2019m trying to decide between double majoring at Yale or doing the Brown RISD Dual Degree (five years), and I would like to know what to expect from double majoring at Yale.",

            "comment": "Okay so the undergrad art major requires 14 course credits, global affairs\\* requires 13 course credits (and an L5 language course). That's 27 course credits, and depending on what language you're going to do and how far along you already are with it, that could be 1-7 additional credits (not sure if you can place into L5s, but I assume it's possible). I doubt either would cover the science requirement (2 credits), looks like global covers QR reqs, I would assume you'd end up in WR credits with global at some point, humanities/art reqs would be covered, and global should also cover social science reqs. \n\nIf you only take classes for the completion of these majors and 2 science credits (assuming you start as L1 for your language for global), you'll hit 36 credits (the required amount to graduate). So it seems doable, especially if you have a good grasp on a non-English language already (that would give you some wiggle room to just take classes you find interesting).\n\n\\*I think global affairs is the Yale equivalent of international relations, not 100% sure, international relations isn't in the Yale list of majors and I assume global is the closest thing?",

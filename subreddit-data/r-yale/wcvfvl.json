    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m a riding first year hoping to major in CS+Math and I\u2019m going through coursetable to make my schedule. My question is, how feasible/stressful is it to take Multivariable Calc, Intro to Comp Sci and Linear Algebra in the same semester (spring)? Im trying to make my schedule to fit in all 14 requirements but it seems like this spring\u2019s going to be super rigorous; is it doable without being overwhelmed? Thank you! :)",

Your goal should be to have a high gpa.  If I'm company X, I don't really give a shit that you took 120 and 225 and 201 in the same semester and got a bunch of C+s.  I'm not going to look past the poor grades  I'm going to take the person with the 3.9 with math 115 etc etc.  Just my view though.  Good luck!",

            "comment": "I guess it really depends on your previous exposure to the material in those classes. This isn't like in high school where you can take a bunch of classes, regardless of their difficulty, and get by. Remember, most semester classes in college are equivalent to full-year classes in high school (at the minimum because some college classes cover even more). However, if you've had previous exposure to multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and proof-based mathematics, then it might be doable. The content in CPSC 201 is all about Linux and how computational systems work, not programming, so if you have had exposure to that somehow, then I guess go for it (the class also uses an old language called Racket, so you'll need to learn that during the class as well). Without any experience, though, this could turn out to be a nightmare schedule depending on your other classes, and I question why you would ever need to cram in classes during a semester. But it's definitely doable with the right amount of effort. I'm a CS + Math major as well, and my first-year schedule was as follows:\n\nMajor related courses:\n\n1st sem: Math 120 (and CPSC 100 but this isn't a major requirement, just did it for fun)\n\n2nd sem: Math 225, CPSC 201 (and ENAS 130, not a major related class but great introduction to C/C++).\n\nI also took Math 244 over the summer because I had some spare time.\n\nI guess it's somewhat similar to what you're proposing, but I just wouldn't recommend taking all three of them at the same time. The early courses and core courses in the major are foundational and will be important for all future electives, so take your time with them. As you progress through the major and start taking electives, the electives won't really be related or at least won't require prerequisite knowledge from other electives, so start off with 1-2 major-related courses each semester and later on you can up it to 3 (the only time I will advise against this general approach is when taking CPSC 323. That class is known for being difficult, and I know I'm going to be taking it alongside some pretty easy non-major related classes). For your first year, I think you should try to take Math 120, Math 225, CPSC 201, and maybe even Math 244  (maybe 2 of them 1st semester and 2 second semester). But you'll also need to consider how you want to spend your time at Yale. I'm involved in clubs and occasionally go out to parties, but the work in CS and Math classes can easily pile up, and you'll need to prioritize that work to do well in your classes. You'll also need to recognize if you actually enjoy Math and CS. You will not get through this major if you do not truly have a passion for proof-based mathematics and computer science. I love staying up at night coding and debugging, and I think proof-based math is really cool because you realize there is so much more to math than the formulaic approaches to math that pervade the American high school system. The world is built on math, and I think that realization is why I chose this major. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I wouldn't mind taking these classes at the same time because I know I would be interested enough to invest a lot of time into them, but I don't think I could say the same for maybe 3 challenging economics courses. So try out a couple of them, and see if you actually enjoy it. Some advice that I'm really glad I took is that you should be open to changing your major and don't be afraid to make that change either (for reference, I applied to Yale as a prospective neuroscience major and had never been exposed to programming until CPSC 100).",

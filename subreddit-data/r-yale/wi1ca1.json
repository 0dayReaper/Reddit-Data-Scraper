If you have ANY inkling that waking up for an 8:30 class everyday might be challenging for you, *pick a different section of French*. Language classes have attendance as a component of their grade. My roommate nearly *failed* his German class because he could manage to get there on time. (IIRC if you\nmiss more than like 5 classes in the semester, it\u2019s an automatic fail??)",

There's no cost to dropping a course, while there's huge potential upside to discovering you either hate or love a field early on.\n\nYou have likely seen or heard cautionary tales about the workload of DS / generic difficulty in adjusting to the many demands of Yale in first year. These concerns are warranted, but are ultimately statements about averages -- you may find that you adjust to college life rapidly, and that you're glad to be taking five credits in first semester.",

A somewhat abstract way of putting it is that early knowledge of your preferences has compounding effects, so it's usually beneficial to try to offset the schedule rigidity that DS imposes if possible.\n\nMore concretely, courses aren't all offered in both fall/spring. So, if you take and enjoy the statistics course in the fall (and become interested in the S&amp;DS major or certificate), you might be able to immediately take a follow-up course in the spring that you would have otherwise had to wait a year for. This might even translate into earlier research opportunities, either in S&amp;DS or in another field where professors would want evidence of basic quant skills (ex. econ).\n\nConversely, if you take the stats course in the fall and hate it, you'll have the opportunity to test out another course/major in the spring (from the somewhat informed position of 'probably not anything too similar to stats'). This is a much, much better position to be in from the perspective of academic exploration than taking your first non-DS/language course in spring and hating it.",

Coming out of high school, you might think it's easy to get up in the morning\u2014but your paradigms swiftly shift, especially with all the social and extracurricular things going on late at night. I also think French is a *great* complement to DS in your first year. With the right prof, it ends up being a very home-y space where all you're doing is trying to communicate and it doesn't matter how articulate or incisive your comments are. If you happen to meet Prof. Ruth Koizim, tell her hi from Janine!\n\nAnyway, it was definitely manageable, as long as you set the right philosophy and expectations for yourself. I don't know what you were like as a high school student, but it's very typical to have always Done Everything: all the reading, all the assignments, all the extra credit, etc. When you get to Yale\u2014and *especially* DS\u2014you can't really do it all, and still have space for everything else you want to do (spend time with friends! rush a cappella! explore campus!). \n\nSo, right now, try to shift your mindset to **being okay with not reading everything**. Instead, what I suggest is reading **part** of any given book and get to know that part very well. That way, you have nuanced thinking and mastery of a given topic to offer in class, rather than piecemeal familiarity with a larger text you necessarily rushed through. (When I teach college classes now, I actually assume that none of my students did all of the reading. I try to balance between honoring those who did without punishing or alienating people who didn't!) Being okay with only reading *parts* will give you a better balance of time, and more space to write the weekly essay. I always felt overburdened with all the readings for the week and didn't get around to the essay until Thursday night. If you start earlier, you can save yourself the heartache!\n\nI'll also give the caveat that my freshman year was literally ten years ago, so things have probably shifted since I was there. I know that writing pedagogy wasn't really a part of DS for me, which meant a huge struggle in trying to figure out what it meant to do \"close reading\" or write at \"college level.\" Last time I talked to the head of DS, they were making efforts to integrate teaching writing into actual class time. \n\nAnyway, thanks for reading that data dump. :) Happy to answer more questions, if you have them! (Also, here's [another data dump on DS](https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/6d3tdx/directed_studies/di06tx9/?context=999) I did some years ago.)",

That something my last English teacher in High School taught us to do, though he was half joking. He talked about how in college he would forget to read something, grab someone\u2019s book before going through the door, read one or two sentences, and then when they got to that part make his best possible commentary while quoting the page number and line perfectly, giving folks the impression he\u2019d read it. \n\nI don\u2019t think that my soul could handle doing that exactly, and I\u2019d be wasting my education, but the point on close reading stands. I\u2019ve heard that from multiple people re DS. There are DS writing tutors now, but from what I\u2019ve heard people find the English Department tutors more helpful? I\u2019ll probably ask help from both before coming up with my own method. \n\nI want to make time for extracurriculars, absolutely. I\u2019d like to get back into ballet, work with YHHAP, and be active in my Jewish community, and continuing my tutoring gig on weekends, at a minimum, while also taking other opportunities (and of course spending times with friends from time to time \ud83d\ude02).\n\nI look forward to this year, and I hope that DS and French will synergize well.\n\n\nI\u2019m wondering, from day to day, how did you balance DS reading and French studying? About how many hours would you say you dedicated to each, and was it during a specified time of day for each?\n\nI\u2019ll be reading the linked info on DS and may or may not be peppering you with questions a little later \ud83d\ude05",

I was an English major, and close reading proved to be such a joy for me\u2014just *living* in the text and making meaning of micro moments. My best profs at Yale were the ones who taught me to see and think differently. I\u2019m excited for you to find those people! (I just visited my favorite profs in June, 7 years after graduation.) Also glad you have a handle on what extracurriculars you want to explore. :)\n\nAnd gosh, the balance of French and DS hm? It has been a long time, so things are blurry, but I remember French being more of a weekday thing (short daily assignments) and DS being a weekend-into-weekday marathon, if that makes sense. I went to the bass library every evening with the person who became my best friend, in that sunless ~~soulless~~ lower basement\u2014but that air conditioning was *so* necessary! (And my roommate, bless her, was *so* chatty!) Anyway, I think I\u2019d start with French and knock out the day\u2019s work, then keep on reading and annotating for the next day\u2019s DS class(es). Of course, when there were French tests/quizzes I\u2019d give a bit more time to it.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome to pepper me with more questions, of course. You can also chat or PM if you like! But fair warning that I\u2019m going to be traveling for the next week and a half, so responses may be more sporadic!",

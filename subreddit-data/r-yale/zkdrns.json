I'm a fellow applicant, but I've seen all over the place that there have been a ton of people who haven't been interviewed who have gotten in. \n\nPersonally, I never expected to get an interview invite because I'm from the middle of nowhere and there are no alumni close to me to interview me. I don't know if it's the same with you, but I wouldn't worry about it.",

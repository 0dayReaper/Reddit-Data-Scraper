Do you think this will be a good choice? ( I heard some people said it\u2019s usually not save at night in New Haven but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true\nThanks",

Be vigilant when walking at night, try not to be on your phone when you walk. \n\nI live in Montreal and our buses drop women off in between stops and wait until we\u2019re safely at our door before driving off, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the same in New Haven but I\u2019m sure they have good safety measures in place considering they\u2019re a college town (such as Montreal being a college town near McGill and Concordia)",

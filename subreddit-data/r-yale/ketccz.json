    "postText": "Hey everyone! Yale's been my dream school since forever. The atmosphere, the people, skull and bones (jk) reeled me in and I fell head over heels in love with the school. I don't know if it's the prestige thing that played tricks on my mind, but I vibed with the school. Even though I've never been fortunate enough to visit the place in person. I always thought about how I'd carry myself at Yale. How I'd interact with others, and how i'd carve myself a place in the yale community. Unfortunately I couldn't get in. It hurts my heart a little but I'm alright. Yale was a fun part of my life, though no one at Yale actually knows that I exist and it sucks that I have to part ways. To the ones who made it in and are currently pursuing their interests at Yale, best of luck with everything! I hope y'all succeed and make dope memories. Maybe I'll meet you all during grad school!",

It is a blue collar school geared towards getting people jobs.  I am now a Professor Emeritus (double boarded MD/PhD) having taught at Yale for the last 23 years.  If you play life seriously you are going to have many rejections.",

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. \n\n*-Theodore Roosevelt*",

    "postText": "I'm not sure what peoples feelings are here, but I feel like if a person only comes here to try and be a troll and not actually engage in discussion at all then they are pretty openly breaking rule 4 \"Exercise civility and good faith when entering a conversation.\" \n\nIt takes about 30 seconds to see that these people on the sub aren't at all a part of Yale and are just there to be a troll and try and stir up shit. \n\n\nSo far the mods have said \"there is often a fine line between troll activities and people wanting to speak their minds, even if some of the opinions may be uncomfortable to others. It takes us time to make sure we don't carelessly censor the latter kind\" which is an easy cop out that just means \"I don't want to actually do anything about this since it means I need to put in any effort.\"\n\nThere is no fine line, when people come in and say \"Yes, Cancel Yale.\n\nElihu Yale Enslaved my people. I will not be marginalised anymore.\n\nIf the left is against racism then CancelYALE.\" and then you look in their profile and they are a white guy from Australia then please explain how that isn't trolling and is just \"speaking their mind\"",

If you check out other subs, like Columbia or NYU, there\u2019s lots of activity. Why not here? Is it because we\u2019re a smaller school? Is Reddit not popular among Yale students? Is there a different platform Yale students use to communicate? (I\u2019m an incoming grad student)",

We used to take a mostly hands off approach to modding which seemed to work fine given that the community would decide what did and did not belong on the sub. However, the influx of troll posts have obviously discredited that approach. We try to remove what we can but naturally we will miss a thing or two. The best thing you can do is flag them so that we see them. Let us know if you're interested in becoming part of the mod team, could probably use someone who is a bit more vigilant.",

Maybe as a sophomore meet with career services but there is no \u2018pre law\u2019 track and in fact most law schools like to admit students with non traditional backgrounds because it adds to the diversity of the class. I don\u2019t love using the words \u2018inspire\u2019 and \u2018passion\u2019 but otherwise I agree with this comment!",

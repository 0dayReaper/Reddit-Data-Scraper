E.g. casual slights like \"Where are you from?\" even though I'm born and raised in Cleveland, that kind of stuff which is largely a non-issue for me and usually the result of well-meaning ignorance. If you take to time to explain to people what they are saying, they will usually apologize for not realizing that their words could potentially  be interpreted as being culturally insensitive. Shouting \"CHECK YOUR PRIVILEGE\" and calling white people \"disgusting\" can do nothing but foster animosity. \n\nI'll admit things can be a little worse at Yale (Ivy League, WASP roots, institutional power, yadda yadda). The incidents on campus are largely spurring by a specific event, which was an [SAE Halloween party](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/11/02/students-accuse-yale-sae-fraternity-brothers-of-having-a-white-girls-only-policy-at-their-party/) that allegedly turned away non-white students from their \"whites only\" party. Which is super shitty if true and understandably created tension on campus. Then, there was [an email an associate master sent out](https://www.thefire.org/email-from-erika-christakis-dressing-yourselves-email-to-silliman-college-yale-students-on-halloween-costumes/) arguing against strict university restrictions of student dress for Halloween costumes:\n\n&gt; ...if you don\u2019t like a costume someone is wearing, look away, or tell them you are offended. Talk to each other. Free speech and the ability to tolerate offence are the hallmarks of\n&gt; a free and open society...\n\n&gt; ...I think there might be something\n&gt; missing in our discourse about the exercise of free speech (including how we dress ourselves)\n&gt; on campus, and it is this: What does this debate about Halloween costumes say about our view\n&gt; of young adults, of their strength and judgment?\n\nI agree with the email and think that it is well-worded and reasonable, but a lot of students interpreted this as her implicit support for blackface and other racial caricatures.\n\nPersonally, I think that wherever you go, there are people who will be assholes. Learning to either civilly address them or completely ignore them is something we teach children. Or to put it bluntly: [be offended, nothing happens!](https://youtu.be/fHMoDt3nSHs?t=3m36s). If you disagree with the establishment and wish to exercise your civil rights to hold protest and demonstration, [this](http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/54bc1ccbecad04fb41e364cc/the-most-iconic-parts-from-martin-luther-kings-i-have-a-dream-speech.jpg) is what it looks like to positively empower a marginalized community and combat bigotry.\n\nThere are flaws with the university and there are flaws with this country. What's great is that we can point out these flaws and call for positive change without fear of institutional retaliation and threat-to-life. Society advances when a group of people can create an impetus for it to recognize and work to remove its existing faults instead of turning into a witch hunt or mob.\n\nMy parents fled their country as students because the state was massacring them. They did not speak a word of English, and as a result, my brother and I both grew up in a childhood of poverty and were routinely picked on for being outsiders to American culture. My point is not to create a pissing contest of who has the most misery. People deal with different personal things. However, if the worst thing that happens today is me being offended, I'd say things aren't so bad that we're beyond the point of civil discussion.",

I grew up in the heart of suburbia in the heart of the Deep South. My name is fully Japanese. People asked me/still ask me where I'm from all the time. Before I left for college (i.e., before I had lived anywhere other than where I grew up), when people asked me where I was from it usually meant what kind of name do I have/what was my heritage (when the context is pre-high school graduation, most people don't ask the question wondering if you lived in other cities beforehand). I explained that my dad was Japanese, my mom was from the states, then both of our lives moved on. I don't recall any particular instance where I felt there was any sort of negativity implied, just a question somebody asks in the process of getting to know another person.\n\nOn the flip hand, I went to weekend Japanese school growing up. The kids there were mean to me because I was American. Mixed kids, especially those who learned English before Japanese, were treated poorly by other children. My only friends were other mixed kids who also didn't fit in. If in a conversation I said I was Japanese, I was made fun of for thinking I Japanese. It was only worse in Japan. Kids there would literally point and laugh in my face, the idiot foreigner who thinks she's Japanese. \n\nIn my experience, America's culture is much less one of exclusion. That is, in many American's minds, being American and being a member of another culture are not mutually exclusive. To my friends here, I am a Japanese-American. I belong to both and I am no less of one for being part of the other. However, in Japan, I am American. I'm even more American for ever thinking I was Japanese.\n\nOf course, there were instances of Americans making me feel like an outsider in the States. My neighbors were very conservative and home schooled and those relationships ended after they started treating me aggressively for not being Christian (they were also children at the time, I have no clue how they are now as adults). However, the people who made me feel like an outsider were an anomaly here. It was not the general culture excluding me, it was the ones who were considered as backwards by many people. In the other part of my life, it was the Japanese culture telling me I would never belong. It is everybody, it is entirely the norm to think that way.\n\nIn summary, I have not felt that by asking where I'm from they are implying I am any less of an American. To the contrary, I am glad that at least one of my cultures is one that does not treat cultures as mutually exclusive. In America, I am both. In Japan, it has been decided for me that I'm not a member of the club. I don't mean to invalidate the experiences anybody else has had. I cannot speak to the intentions of those by whom others have been asked the question. However, I do feel that we should not be so quick to assume that asking where somebody is from automatically implies being less American. ",

I grew up in a very white, and very rural state. I really don't get asked \"where are you from?\" very often, but usually, I can tell that what people mean by this is: \"what ethnicity are you?\", and ask out of friendly curiosity. I have never taken it to imply that I am not a \"real American\" because I don't look (completely) white. If a white person flew to another country with a different ethnic majority, they would receive at least similar, and very likely much more blunt comments and inquiries as to their nationality and race. I don't think that most of the people who become irate at white people for harmless curiosity about race would even recognize the same dynamic in countries with a non-white majority as problematic. \n\nThe whole thing just makes people who represent the cause of social justice look insane.

I still don't get if that's your underlying implication.\n\nEither way, I agree with some of what you originally said. But, if some frat douche bags turned away people, that shouldn't \"understandably create tension on campus\". That should just create tension with whoever the douche bag frat guy was at the door who was a dick. So while you're trying to draw some greater parallel to society as a whole, you're just missing the point. Frat stars a fucking douche bags. They always have been and always will be. \n\nIunno.

There is an unfortunate sort of hysteria surrounding the events at the moment, and right now I think it's best to allow the situation to cool down further. \n\nRetrospection and introspection can unfold in weeks to come. It's evident that many students of color feel profoundly wronged. This isn't just about a fraternity incident and a single letter; it's a response to much deeper inequalities. And this isn't something that just concerns students of color, but everyone at Yale (and beyond). There will be a lot to talk about, but things won't go far when everyone's yelling at everyone else.

The Master of a college is supposed to be create a strong community and a \"homey\" feeling within the college (that's their specific job). I've heard that Master Christakis, who just started this semester, has told students he sees himself as the \"intellectual leader\" of Silliman, which is traditionally not the Master's job.\n\nI don't find much wrong with Erika's email either, but I do think the student makes sense. In the aftermath of what could have been a small conflict, the Christakises have done a shit job of deescalating the situation. Silliman no longer feels like a home to its students, therefore the Masters have failed.",

You assume that just because someone was able to achieve more in their lifetime in the form of those metrics measured by Yale (test scores, grades, national competitions, etc.) that they *worked harder*.  That is SO untrue it hurts.  Yale looks at admission standards by the background of that student, where they came from, and what they were able to do with the resources given to them. \n\nIf Yale didn't do this, it would be 99% kids from the top 10 high schools in the nation with unbelievably rich parents and would make for an extraordinarily boring intellectual environment on campus.  \"Getting into\" Yale isn't just about what you have achieved thus far, it's about what you have left to contribute to the campus community.

Quite the opposite, actually. The purpose was to get rid of the old culture, which was only possible through destroying existing cultural paradigms, which were dictated by the elites, which therefore had to be ousted.     \nThat is why it started with very public &amp; very loud attacks on *the Bourgeoisie*. Many intellectuals were simply part of that elite. They were, in fact, their own elite. *That* is what was targeted to be destroyed. Hence the fact that so many intellectuals were abused or sent to labour camps.\n\nThis all happened to annul elites, bring about more equality in education, and to make high levels of education and intellectualism one of the cornerstones of Chinese culture among the general population (which in many ways succeeded, by the way, hundreds of millions people suddenly had access to education health care that was previously reserved for the rich). \n\nSeems like these things are still highly misunderstood in the US. These movements weren't \"anti-intellectual\" in the least (in fact, they thought to promote intellectualism among more people), it was anti-aristocratic. It isn't actually all as bad as anti-communist propaganda wants you to believe. These things weren't senseless. Without them many good things wouldn't be the way they are. In fact, like it or not, without Mao China would still be a shithole of a developing nation rued by aristocrats. However, of course these things were often implemented very badly and myopically, but would anything have changed in a reasonable amount of time through reform? Without forceful revolution? Do you believe that? Is the alternative better? I am pretty sure Chinese people today would rather live in the country they  live in today than in a country where these things never happened.\n \nI am not saying this to defend the actions of Mao, I am sure that there were better solutions to bringing about that necessary change (although I personally can't think of one, rich elites don't tend to give up their power or wealth without a fight). I am just saying that if this was about anti-elitist behaviour, do call me! As once these people start overthrowing rich elites, I will stand right with them. Currently, they are just whiny SJWs without any constructive purpose, though.",

So I don't think the student was talking about Yale not being an intellectual space, I think she was talking about Silliman college, and the behavior of the Master. I've heard that Master Christakis, who just started this semester, has told students he sees himself as the \"intellectual leader\" of Silliman, which is traditionally not the Master's job.",

Someone from Yale wrote a good response in the main video but it got buried.\n\nAt Yale, students live in \"residential colleges\" on the Oxford and Cambridge model. Its a small community, with about 100 people in your year in your college, and most live on campus all four years. You live in your college itself, which is a basically dorms built around a courtyard. Colleges are the heart of social life at Yale. \n\nThe student in the video was confronting the master of her college. Master is the person in charge of managing the social life in the college. The role is therefore different than your average faculty member, whose job it should be to challenge students intellectually. \n\nThe master is meant to be someone all students can go to in times of stress or when they are upset and have someone to talk to. When she challenges the master in the video, she asks him why he accepted the job. She doesn't mean the job of professor, she means the job of master, and that comes with different responsibilities. \n\nI suspect she now wishes she managed her emotions better during the exchange, but that alone shouldn't lead to the condemnation we've seen. \n\ntl;dr - The master plays a unique role at Yale, and in part, that role is about creating home. \n\nI'm Yale College 2016 by the way\n\nedit: grammar",

That doesn't change all that much in this case I think. \n\n\"This is not about creating an intellectual space, this is about creating a home?\" - to be sure, the term \"intellectual space\" is general enough that it can be taken poorly. Even the residential building, after all, is at its best a somewhat intellectual space when its filled with Yale students.\n\nHowever, the primary job of the master is to facilitate students' intellectual pursuits, and not to place him or herself at the center of the debate. That is for the classroom and extra-curriculars, not the residential college. \n\nI also don't think anyone was asking for \"coddling\" exactly. The weird thing about Christakis's email is that it responded to a university-wide email urging people to be respectful when they chose a costume. Did that email really call for a response?\n\nHowever, \"comfort\" is something people should have in their homes, even if their home is at Yale.\n\ntl;dr The residential college is indeed primarily a living space, and to the extent that she was distinguishing that from a center of intellectual debate, the statement makes sense. \n\nps.

We're students, graduate or undergraduate. They're professors. There's a basic modicum of civil regard that is missing from the mob's behavior that I think does not belong at Yale (or indeed any academic setting). ",

What college masters mean to Yale students is an identity that has changed over many decades, but essentially it does embody a guardian-like role. Some of the most beloved masters, like Pitti and others, have been exactly that to their college's students. If you don't know what it is or how this works, you're evidently not part of Yale, so just leave it.",

Perhaps the master need not play a therapist role (though many masters do and their students are better for it).

I'll grant that that isn't in the definition provided, but i think that a consensus of students would agree with it. \n\nThe point is that the email was unnecessary and provocative, and probably therefore ought not to have been sent. It alienated people in Silliman, especially many people of color, and therefore is a poor display of the master's power to the extent that it alienates members of the community. \n",

I'm quite anti-PC myself and a subscriber to /r/TumblrInAction. Yes, there are extremists on both sides, but I directly received in my inbox both of the emails in question, both from the IAC and Erika Christakis, and it was without a doubt Erika Christakis' email that blew the whole thing up - it was seeing censorship where there was none and manufacturing controversy.\n\nTo address OP's actual question, first of all your question is retarded. The \"Yale student body\" is 5,000+ undergrads and there is no one issue on which everyone agrees. My view is that it's both - residential colleges at Yale are a fairly unique setting, and Masters are tasked with both creating an intellectual space AND a home within each college. The Erika Christakis email accomplished neither, and was wholly unnecessary and unconstructive.",

The first email was extremely mild in tone, and the gist of it was pretty much what you said: \"Here are some things like blackface that are generally considered very offensive by many people. You, the students, have full freedom of expression and the freedom to wear whatever you want, we're just giving a gentle reminder to simply think about the potential social consequences.\"\n\nNobody had any problem with that email. That's why everyone was surprised when Erika Christakis sent out a two-page long email arguing against the first very benign email. When someone feels the need to write an argument in response to a modest request for mutual respect, it comes off as having a victim complex. Let's be clear that although everyone on reddit is piling on \"Yale SJWs\" as being easily offended and playing the victim, it was Christakis who first played the victim, by feeling the need to ARGUE against what amounted to a note saying \"please consider being respectful in your costume choices this halloween!\"",

I agree that the professor had a right and reason to send that email, because girls like the one yelling in the video and everyone calling for these people to be fired have ALREADY left the land of logic and reason and more people are jumping off the cliff each day.\n\nUNLESS there was an outbreak of people being offensive I don't know why the original \"let's all be sensitive\" email was even sent. Clearly the students there have been spoon fed this since Kindergarten and if they happen to do something their friends find offensive then their friends can tell them. It's not anyone else's place to monitor and censor what people wear on party night. It really really isn't. If I want to wear a Kimono and put chopsticks in my hair that's my right and it won't hurt any Asian people because you know what? It's a costume and not meant to reflect reality.",

That's *exactly what the first email was saying*. It was saying think about whether some of your friends might find your costume offensive and you can avoid that argument with your friends and have more fun Halloween night by choosing a different costume. If you choose not to change to a different costume that's also your right and we can't stop you. There was no implication of any \"monitoring\" or \"censoring\" of costumes by any administration or authority. \n\n",

Yale did have an Halloween blackface incident in 2007, and *thankfully* not since then.

Nobody is saying that Christakis was saying \"hey, it's ok to dress in blackface.\" Students are saying that responding to a polite request to not dress in blackface by trying to make it into a free speech issue is very insensitive timing a when black women were just barred from a fraternity party. I'm really not sure how many other ways I can explain this. Nobody was *complaining* about something that is not actually a problem. The first email was *say there was blackface recently at Yale*.  It was a short friendly note saying \"thanks y'all for not wearing blackface in recent years, let's continue to keep it that way!\" Students are questioning why a simple note like that warrants a 2-page response dragging in free speech.

The master himself was called disgusting, and the crowd was trying to get him to apologize for seeing this as a free speech issue -- to apologize for thinking in a way that was not the way of the majority around him.\n\nI too subscribe to TiA, though I've been debating unsubscribing since it seems to have turned into /pol/-lite over the past few months.  I used to think (still do really) that the sub was cherry-picking examples of whackos from around the country to support their narrative.  Now people at Yale are calling for several faculty members to step down because they didn't immediately apologize for having an opinion different from that of the students.  \n\nYou can call Christakis a fool and out of touch for wanting to allow racist costumes, but can we at least agree that she should be allowed to say it?",

Bryniarski seems to be exemplifying what Christakis is worried about when she says \"I don\u2019t, actually, trust myself to foist my Halloweenish standards and motives on others.\"  Even though his motives are good and his ultimate cause of social justice is one that the vast majority of this campus believes in, he is still suggesting that the opposition's speech has no value purely because his moral outlook says so.\n\nIn the lead-up to Halloween, before any of this went down, I remember hearing two students discussing racist Halloween costumes.  One recalled seeing someone dressed as an ISIS fighter -- which is undoubtedly a costume in bad taste at the very least -- and immediately declared that the person wearing it was a disgusting human being.  The other student agreed wholeheartedly.\n\nThis kind of speech isn't \"helpful,\" as I see it.  Immediately declaring your political enemies to be subhuman seems to be a trend now, on both sides of the aisle and even, apparently, at Yale.  It made me extremely uncomfortable to hear, but I didn't say anything, because I felt there was no way to articulate my misgivings without the other two immediately lumping me in with the racists.\n\nSo a few days later, students receive Christakis's email, which at least in part touches on what I'm trying to say here.  It was certainly not an angry letter calling students little snots for wanting SAE to not be racist.  It was an assertion that racism should be confronted by students, instead of solved from above by the administration.\n\nAnd then within days there were 750 people signing a google doc personally insulting Christakis and telling her that her academic opinion came too close to violence against minorities.  I don't care if she IS the associate master; that doc was the first block of text in this whole debacle that I couldn't believe at first was written by a Yalie due to its vitriol.  There was no \"helpfulness\" there, just mudslinging.\n\nYou point out that Christakis is the associate master and therefore has duties above those of a normal professor.  You're quite right, but as far as I can tell, the email is actually *fulfilling* those duties, not betraying them.  The first line of the email cites frustration among some unknown number of Sillimanders with the original email from the university committee, which is apparently why Christakis felt the need to write her own.  So whose version of \"helpful\" takes precedence here -- those who think the committee email was a call for censorship, or those who think Christakis is a closet racist?",

In this situation, though I would agree that the Christakis email was unhelpful, because it caused a lot of pain without adding much to the conversation at all. Let me explain what I mean - I've been spending all day trying to explain how I see it to various redditors with varying degrees of success.\n\nYou said that Christakis's email \"was an assertion that racism should be confronted by students, instead of solved from above by the administration.\" Honestly, that's what I got from the first email from the IAC, and I think most people saw it that way. The first email was just saying \"fyi things like blackface are offensive, you have the right to wear it but other students may confront you about it.\" Christakis said in her email that she felt fear and uncertainty about wearing a sari as a white woman or dressing a little girl as Tiana or Mulan when pretty much nobody would be opposed to that (from people I've talked to including many open letter signers). I certainly have no problem with those things. When you respond to friendly note basically saying \"Please play nice with each other!\" with a two-page email basically saying \"M-muh free speech!\" it seems like you have a vested interest in being offensive, not just that you are defending the right to be offensive.\n\nI would therefore say that the email is betraying her duties as Assoc. Master because she placed herself in opposition to parts of the Silliman community by facetiously insinuating that there is some campus conspiracy to infringe on free speech and that elements of it exist in the Silliman community.\n\nAs for whose version of \"helpful,\" I'd say everyone should read the IAC email and decide for themselves who is in the right. I personally can't see any way the IAC email could be interpreted as a call for censorship. I also have doubts about the \"unknown number of Sillimanders.\" As a Sillimander, I can tell you that most of the college doesn't know Erika Christakis very well because she's halfway through her first year, and she hasn't exactly made a huge effort to reach out to students (for comparison, I see Master (Nicholas) Christakis all the time eating ice cream in the dining hall).  I've maybe seen her once in the dining hall and once at an event in the Master's House since the beginning of this year. When I first read Erika Christakis' email, I found it really weird and a bit hard to believe that \"multiple\" Silliman students would have read that benign IAC email and immediately run to Erika Christakis to vent their frustrations. Obviously there's no way to prove this, but I think Erika Christakis made up or exaggerated the number of students protesting the IAC email to lend credence to her own projecting unfounded fears of censorship.",

I concede that she could be pushing an agenda, though even if she was I still believe the response by the student body was excessive and downright childish, especially towards her husband.\n\nRegardless, I'd like to thank you for letting me understand the mind of the letter-signers a bit better, though I still can't condone their actions.\n\nYou have my respect -- and my sympathy -- for trying to fight Reddit on this one.  I suspect that a good chunk of the commenters here are just here to throw shit at social justice in general.\n\n",

You were there, you probably know the context surrounding this situation better than anyone in this thread.\n\nI think the thing is that the articles I have read have been stating that the original email had a very authoritative and commanding tone, telling people what and what not to wear. You say it wasn't that bad, and in that case I would agree with you about Christakis' response being unnecessary. And also in that case I would understand why students were offended by her email because it would sound like she was trying to start something instead of merely replying to something.\n\nOn a side note- the reddit community is just as bad as the SJWs in the sense that once it makes its mind up about something it can't let it go, and will always be a douchebag about it. The hipocracy pisses me off.",

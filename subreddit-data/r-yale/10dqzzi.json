    "postText": "Question: in any of your political science, philosophy, or theory courses in general, is there any substantive debate?\n\nI'm  trying to get a pulse on the academic culture, as to whether not certain schools have a ethos/practice of encouraging and engaging in meaningful debate, independent thought, and critical  inquiry.\n\nOr, do you mostly just sit there and listen?\n\nAsking for me. Terrified of transferring to another mind numbing school unless I'm getting some benefit out of it like living in Miami. Also I'm just very curious because one of my professors just came from an Ivy and seems to be oblivious to some factors in his classroom that infantilize students and seem to hold the classroom to a low standard for discourse. Any input is really appreciated. Cross-posting.",

For example, in a political science class I could care less whether my peers agree with the invasion of a foreign country, but whether or not theory and empirics support taking such action is a more interesting conversation.",

            "comment": "I find most of my discussions in my seminars to be centered around nuancing other people\u2019s points rather than full-on debates. I would also say, especially with theory-heavy classes you are usually parsing through new, dense, complex material, so disagreements are usually about specific nuances in specific interpretations of individual texts, rather than broad ideologies.",

I am speaking about understanding theory (incl fine grained reading) and debating theoretical problems (givenism, structure, agency, materialism, reason, justification ....), which is *not* at the forefront. Rhather it's getting a vague grasp of theory and applying it. But cannot compare to other US universities.",

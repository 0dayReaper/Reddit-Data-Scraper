You\u2019ll end up wanting to major in Astronomy. There is a fair amount of math in the QR astronomy courses (100 level) but it\u2019s all algebra and the most basic physics, no trig or calculus. You do deal with fairly complicated concepts, but this gets easier as you get better. Also, some classes tend to make the first problem set super long so that students who are looking for gutts skip it when they see the syllabus, but don\u2019t be fooled. And unfortunately these classes all fill up quick.",

The lawsuit, which is seeking class action status from the U.S. District Court of Connecticut, includes accounts by two current students, three former students as well as an alumni group representing several dozen others. In the court filing, students described being visited in the hospital after Yale officials learned of suicide attempts or other mental health problems and being warned that if they didn\u2019t leave the school voluntarily, the university could kick them out involuntarily. Reached by phone and email Wednesday morning, Yale officials did not have an immediate response to the lawsuit\u2019s allegations. In the suit, one international student \u2013 Hannah Neves, who was hospitalized in 2020 after a suicide attempt \u2013 recounted being visited by three Yale administrators and resisting their pressure to withdraw, according to the lawsuit. Days later, upon discharge from the hospital, she learned the administrators had withdrawn her involuntarily. ***Yale authorities then told her she could only retrieve her possessions with a police escort. When she asked about saying goodbye to her friends, university administrators told her \u201cshe could only do so off campus\u201d because she was no longer allowed on Yale property.*** The lawsuit comes two weeks after a Washington Post story, which drew on the accounts of more than 25 current and former students and was cited in Wednesday\u2019s court filings.\n\n[(No paywall)](https://archive.ph/nBPxY#selection-379.0-487.116)",

Yale def made mistakes with this policy and this lawsuit is likely an important step in making administrators fix this mistake. However, I still maintain it\u2019s important to find what is leading students to this dark place, and I think toxic professors, toxic DUS, toxic advisors, and impossible standards from these entities are driving this mental health crisis (most are amazing, but I\u2019d say there are an abnormal amount of academics who don\u2019t have the students\u2019 best interests at heart). If Yale cares they\u2019ll settle the lawsuit, and then do an investigation into if these students have any overlapping professors, DUS, advisors, investigate practices and faculty of each department if there is a trend of mental health events in them, and act accordingly.",

                    "comment": "I would disagree. Academic standards generally lowered during the last decades and I suspect a increase of toxicity amongst faculty is a stretch. I would rather say it's the connection between the overall situation of today's students (political-social crisis, economic decline, high pressure to succeed, increased demand of self-marketing, CV building, online presentation etc pp), which all together put students in a shitty situation to begin with. This PLUS Yale's obvious failure to deal with symptoms of this situation. Causes lie in our socio political system and cannot be undone by a private institution.",

Current students at Vermont Law school have been fighting administration regarding discrimination and retaliation around the school's accommodation policies, targeting those who have medical ailments and accommodations. Most recently there has been a number of students who have been either been pushed into medical withdrawal, made the school inaccessible or have been targeted at the latest attempt to remove student's who cost the school too much money in resources to accommodate their disabilities. How can we assist those who are facing these injustices?",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m an incoming first year who wants to do CS major, and hopefully do combined BS/MS in the 4 years (depending on whether I\u2019m able to) \n \n\nAlso maybe I\u2019m getting ahead of myself thinking about this already but oh well\n\n\nFor my first term I\u2019m thinking of doing CPSC201, MATH120 or 115 depending on placement, Japanese (either beginner or intermediate depending on how I place - I\u2019ve done some self study so I know a few hundred kanji and basic grammar) and then a first year seminar. \n\n\nIs this reasonable ?? I\u2019m coming from the UK with further maths so I think I should be able to place into and handle 115, and maybe even math 120. \n\n\nI was also thinking about taking CS50 but I\u2019ve done lots of coding independently so I feel that maybe doing a fully introductory course may be redundant and I can start with CPSC201\n\n\nIs this a reasonable course load?\nThanks for any advice :)",

            "comment": "Hello!\nI am a CS major and just finished my first year. I took a very similar course schedule my first-year fall - CPSC 201, MATH 120, SPAN 130 (placed into since I took Spanish in high school), and a first-year seminar. It was a very manageable schedule, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about it. If any of the courses gives you adverse trouble for some reason, you have 6 credit/d/fail opportunities, two of which expire after your first year.\n\nStarting with CPSC 201 definitely makes sense if you have any coding experience - you\u2019ll be fine.\n\nOne thing I will note is that MATH 115/120 are both not needed for the CS major - the only required math course for CS majors is CPSC 202. I took MATH 120 since I am double majoring in stats, and I think it seems somewhat unnecessary for those just majoring in CS. Obviously still at your discretion.\n\nPM me if you have any more questions!",

It\u2019s so helpful. \n\nI\u2019ll skip CS50 and start with cpsc 201 then - it seems to make sense to do so. \nTbh I\u2019m trying to do a few maths courses because I like it and also I think it\u2019s important for someone doing computer science especially since I\u2019m interested in AI. Also do you know what the difference is between MATH244 and CPSC202? They both seem to be discrete maths and can be substituted with eachother for the major",

                            "comment": "If you're interested in AI/just like math then it definitely does make sense to take MATH 120 (and linear algebra, MATH 222 or 225 or 226). That's part of the reason I chose to as well.\n\nYes, either CPSC 202 or MATH 244 can be taken to fulfill the math requirement. CPSC 202 is generally seen as the \"default\", easier way to get the requirement taken care of, while MATH 244 is harder but more pertinent to CS + MATH and CS + ECON majors. As I understand it, CPSC 202 is focused on the relevant (for CS majors) portions of several mathematical topics, while MATH 244 dives deeper into theory.\n\n I took CPSC 202 this past spring. I thought it was certainly challenging, but still the right decision for me given that I'm a CS and S&amp;DS major.\n\nThe difference is also discussed [here](https://zoo.cs.yale.edu/dsac/docs/math/), on the CS DSAC (departmental student advisory committee) webpage. I'd also recommend checking out the other parts of the webpage, as it has a ton of good info (particularly for you, \"New &amp; Current CS Major Advice\" and \"BS+MS Special Program\").",

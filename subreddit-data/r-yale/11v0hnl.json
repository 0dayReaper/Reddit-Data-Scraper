    "postText": "Hellooo I was recently admitted to Yale REA and also received an email saying I was pre-admitted to the directed studies program. I had absolutely no idea what this program was when I was admitted, but I think have a slightly better idea of what the program entails now. \n\nIt seems like the workload for the program is intense but also doable; however, I was wondering what past DSers think about the program. Do you have to be a genius of some sort to get All As while you're in the program? I am definitely interested in the program, but I also don't want to tank my GPA first semester of college.",

            "comment": "I think the difficulty of DS is generally overrated -- some students do struggle, but this mostly comes down to two factors:\n\n* Transitioning to college coursework is often hard if you didn't go to a good high school (private / magnet / top public / etc)\n* Humanities classes in college have no direct analogue at most high schools, whereas something like General Chemistry is reasonably well approximated by AP Chem\n\nNone of these factors are related to the inherent difficulty of the DS coursework, so if you have the right background, you may even find DS rather easy.\n\nOn the workload front -- less than 5 students out of ~100 per year read all of the assigned readings. You'll be fine. Feel free to pm if you want more info.",

And now I\u2019m in finance for my job. So whatever your background; Wherever you are going after college; yes do it!",

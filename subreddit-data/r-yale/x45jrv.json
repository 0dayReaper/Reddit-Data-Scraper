    "postText": "I want to apply to Yale divinity school I know that I can get good grades but the problem is I don't know if I can come up with something impressive to put on my college application I made a list of things that I can do that might be impressive but I do not know if it is good enough. So I was thinking that I could\n\nOrganize some volunteer activities at my church.\n\nMaybe tailor thrift store suits for people who got out of prison.\n\nCome up with a Christian version of boy scouts or girl scouts. \n\nAre any of these activities impressive?",

            "comment": "Your activities are good, but don't do them just because they look good.  Do them because you have a passion for them.  Since you are going for a M Div, are you aiming for ordained or lay ministry, you should have a target with which to use your degree.  You should also have a passion to be challenged intellectually because you definitely will be challenged at YDS !  Don't go to Yale Divinity because you want to go to Yale, you should go there because you want to grow and serve the Church.  Just started my second year at YDS and love it.",

Harvard, U of Chicago, Vanderbilt and Duke are fine divinity schools too.  Have a plan B.  Keep at it and best of luck to you .",

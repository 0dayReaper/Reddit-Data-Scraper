    "postText": "I'm an incoming grad student who will be working on Science Hill. Yale says the only parking they can offer me is in the Science Park Garage, which google says is a 24min walk from my place of work and would cost \\~$1000/yr. Does anyone know of any closer places I could park? I will be commuting in by car every day and was honestly hoping to be able to park in one of the lots right by my building, but apparently they're faculty only. I know there's street parking, but for an everyday commute that gets annoying really fast, not to mention expensive as well.",

There are at least *some* spaces available in East Rock, it would just be a matter of how close or far it is, which street it\u2019s on.\n\nI don\u2019t know off the top of my head which ones are free, but a drive around can help you figure that out; it just needs to be a street that doesn\u2019t have the \u201czone #\u201d signs.

I don't have a car, so I'm not all too familiar with the parking situation, but maybe ask an older graduate student in your program what they suggest? I know there are parking garages in downtown New Haven, so depending on how many times a week you'll need to be on campus, maybe that's a good alternative depending on where you'll be working?",

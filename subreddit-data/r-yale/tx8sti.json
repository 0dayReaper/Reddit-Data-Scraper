    "postText": "Admit here. \n\nI\u2019m from a household that scoffs at the idea of me, a woman, going to an Ivy League- giving up whatever virtues they wished for me to have living under their control. \n\nI am extremely nervous for the financial aid award, and was wondering if there was a way to approach the fin aid office to discuss a way to ensure efc is as low as possible as an incentive for extremely hesitant parents to let me attend? \n\nIf not, are there any other resources? Perhaps one here has gone through something similar. \n\nThank you.\n\nEDIT: They just ignored the massive paragraph and asked another random question about FASFA, lol",

I think it would be a travesty to be denied a chance to attend Yale or any other prestigious school because your parents scoff at the idea. If they refuse to pay, I would really encourage you to find other means to attend. Since you will get fin aid anyway, the costs won\u2019t be prohibitively high for you to pay it all back relatively quickly.",

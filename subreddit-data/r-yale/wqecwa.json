It also lets you order ahead so you can pick up your food at restaurants, or even get it delivered.\n\n* Cody\u2019s Diner is a great 24-hour Snackpass or Uber Eats option.\n* Good Nature Food Market (aka \u201cGheav\u201d [pronounced \u201cgee-have\u201d]), is a 24-hour bodega with subs.\n* Est Est Est has good pizza &amp; huge calzones.\n* Alpha Delta has a sub sandwich called a Wentzel that\u2019s amazing. \n* Main Garden is a solid late-night Chinese food option. \n* On Sunday nights until 3am, you can get large, one-topping Brick Oven pizzas for just $10.\n* On Tuesday afternoons between 5-7pm, at Garden Catering, you can order a 1/2 lb of chicken nuggets and the price will be whatever the time on the clock is (so if you order at 5:17pm, the price will be $5.17).\n* Papa John\u2019s is always 50% off for Yale students. Either order delivery on Snackpass, or on the Papa John\u2019s website with the code YALE50.\n* Mamoun\u2019s has decent middle eastern food and is open daily until 3am.\n* Aladdin crown pizza is also solid and close to old campus.\n* Sushi on chapel is right next to old campus and has solid sushi (though it\u2019s not open particularly late).",

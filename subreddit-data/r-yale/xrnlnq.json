If you are unable to navigate over to the yale website and find the undergrad and grad sites that have all of this information posted very clearly\u2026 I think you might want to rethink your current plans.",

Not sure where you\u2019re from but if this text displays then you\u2019re allowed to know there are also 69 students in the secret fifth level of education- Doctor of Doctorates. \n\nIt sounds big but since it moved from Big 10 to SEC the Yale Bowl is one of the smaller stadia in the division. \n\nAlso Yale does not have majors. Good luck with your project. \n\nI was in JE.",

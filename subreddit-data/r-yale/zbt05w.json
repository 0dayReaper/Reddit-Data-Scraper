Someone did a reddit IAMA a while back if you're interested.   \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9yhme/by\\_request\\_i\\_am\\_a\\_member\\_of\\_skull\\_and\\_bones\\_amaa/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9yhme/by_request_i_am_a_member_of_skull_and_bones_amaa/)  \n\n\nHere are some leaked pictures from their tomb:  \n[https://yalealumnimagazine.org/articles/4075-inside-skull-and-bones](https://yalealumnimagazine.org/articles/4075-inside-skull-and-bones)  \n\n\nIf you're really interested, there's a whole book on the subject called Secrets of the Tomb. The author was in Scroll &amp; Key, but used a bunch of leaked documents/interviews to write it.   \n[https://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Tomb-Skull-League-Hidden/dp/0316735612](https://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Tomb-Skull-League-Hidden/dp/0316735612)\n\nSource:\n\nWasn't in it, but took a class on the history of Yale when I was an undergrad (Shoutout to Prof. Gitlin!), and I wrote a paper on the history of Yale's secret societies as my final paper.",

            "comment": "Okay so. See the resources Gh0stSpyder shared for a more comprehensive overview.\n\nThey meet on thursdays and sundays. The official meeting starts at VIII SBT. Skull and bones time is 5 minutes later then normal time. So VIII means 7.55 pm. Before this they have a dinner, and there can be a speaker, an alumni of skull and bones, called patriarch. \n\nIt is a senior society, and 15 juniors are tapped each year. They are initiated with a ceremony, during which they go on a pseudo-tour of the building, experience all kinds of things and sketches, and have a main ceremony in the inner temple called 322. This ceremony you can read about in Alexandra Robbin\u2019s book.\n\nThe active senior members are called knights, the alumni are patriarchs. The leader of each meeting is called Uncle Toby and every week there is another Uncle Toby. There is also a S.E.C: Secretary of the Eulogian Club. This is more permanent position, and is the liaison between the current club and the RTA (Russel Trust Association).\n\nThere are three important kinds of activities: Debates, LH\u2019s and CB\u2019s.\n\nDebates can be about anything. Everyone puts in a topic in the Yorik, a skull. And then after one is selected, eveyone gets a limited amout of time to speak about the subject. \n\nCB\u2019s (Connubial Bliss): every member presents their sexual history.\n\nLH\u2019s (Life History): every member presents their life story.\n\nThen there numerous other things: dances, music, a bit of ritual like sounding a gong and opening texts. And ofc boodleball. Bc what is a secret society like without its own kind of Quidditch \ud83d\ude2c\n\nThen, finaly, when the year is almost over, meetings are reserved to tap new members. A hard and tiresome process which can really test the new bonds that are established between the members.\n\nOh, and there is also something called a black book. Every meeting is recorded, and all stuff going back even to the 19th century is recorded, and so debates can be read about the civil war for instance.\n\nAlso, they go for a little vacation to their own private island: deer island\n\nAnd then last but not least, the 15 knights have a private hideout for their senior year, where they can come and go as they please.\n\nNow I am wondering how many people will ask themselves if Uncle Toby sent me lol",

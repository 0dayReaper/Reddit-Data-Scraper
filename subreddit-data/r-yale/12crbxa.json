It was really hard because I felt like I was throwing away things I had worked on for so long, but my life is so much better now",

If someone is an older, established prof at a great school and hasn't had students finish PhDs with them and get jobs, you should want to know why\n\nAlso, this might have been fine if there hadn't been a pandemic, but he was pretty old and never really got the hang of zoom school",

Similar to the first commenter, I also didn\u2019t feel at all connected to my DUS or advisors. Two weeks into my first semester I met with my DUS (in the field that I love and have the most experience in) and after explaining my story they shook their head at me and told me they \u201cdidn\u2019t get it.\u201d That kind of set the tone for my first semester at Yale. I found a school I wanted to transfer to that had a similar program in the field that interests me. I applied and was accepted. However the school I applied to offers barely any aid, so I couldn\u2019t make the move. I changed my major, and found a better DUS. Now I\u2019ve gotten used to Yale, and will finish my degree here. I\u2019d implore you to think twice about transferring, you can definitely get through this!",

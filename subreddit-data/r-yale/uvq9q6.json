I was wondering if there are any neighbourhoods in New Haven that are considered to be \"unsafe\" or that we should generally avoid? Thanks so much!",

Will you be living in Harkness in your first year? There were lots of MPH students along with med students there, and that's a good way to get to know lots of people.\n\nI never ventured far locally on foot compared to car, so I can only describe a small area. I felt safe around the Yale campus. My general range was south to Anlyan Center--consider a walking buddy if you're going further to Amistad, west to Park St., east to State St. (though beyond that to Frank Pepe and Sally's Apizza) north to Grove St. I'm sure plenty of places further than that are fine, but that's all I can speak to from experience.",

            "comment": "Most neighborhoods there are pretty safe.\n\nOne rule of thumb is to look at Google Maps, plot out the walk to campus and see if it passes through areas with cafes/restaurants and/or major office or university buildings. If so, it's likely going to be pretty safe. If you're going to be walking along the edge of a highway, past a bunch of parking lots, and then through a neighborhood without any amenities then it might be less safe at night. You can also use Google Streetview to see what the walk will look like.\n\nA bigger consideration might be proximity to campus, because that's going to impact how much walking you have to do. If you're biking or driving that doesn't matter as much though. There are a lot of great neighborhoods that are outside the typical walking distance but are worth considering.  Most of the other students will be near the Yale campus, but the CT Transit buses and bikes are good in New Haven and if you have a car it's pretty easy to park if you're going out to someone's place for drinks or whatnot. If you live farther out you might find a better deal on rent, but look out for slumlords (there are going to be some slumlords near campus too but most places are pretty fixed up and costly)",

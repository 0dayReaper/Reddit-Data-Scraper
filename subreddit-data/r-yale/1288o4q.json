    "postText": "Hey everyone! I got into Yale yesterday and Duke today!! I\u2019m thrilled to be in the predicament that I\u2019m in, but I\u2019m having trouble deciding. I plan on majoring in Economics and Mathematics. I have a few questions for some students at Yale.\n\n1. How collaborative are the students? I\u2019ve heard that in places like WashU, people keep to themselves for the most part, and I really want a collaborative environment.\n\n2. How easy is it to do research? I really would love to do research in undergrad.\n\n3. Does going to Yale help getting competitive internships (especially those that pay well\ud83d\ude09)?\n\n4. What is you\u2019re favorite and least favorite thing about Yale? \n\nThanks to everyone in advance for making this decision a bit easier for me!",

            "comment": "1. Yalies are almost a bit too collaborative. If you're into that kind of thing, you'd probably be quite pleased.\n2. Pretty much anyone can secure *some* research position of some sort. It just depends on what you're willing to settle for as some positions and studies are more sought after than others. Because our student body is skewed toward the social sciences and humanities, most STEM-oriented students can secure stuff quite easily. Other disciplines are a bit harder but, in the grand scheme of things, quite easy to get into.\n3. Yes. There are a surprising number of companies that recruit intensively out of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Stanford while forgoing similarly prestigious schools (although I can't speak to Duke in particular). Although both schools are similarly celebrated in the U.S., I'd humbly suggest that the Yale name is probably better known internationally, so if you're looking to get competitive internships abroad, Yale would probably be particularly advantageous. If you're interested in domestic opportunities, it would be somewhat advantageous.\n4. My favourite thing is the people. They're surprisingly pleasant, humble, and interesting to be around. I never feel bored in a conversation with a Yalie. The worst part\u2014no matter what self-deluding Yalies tell themselves\u2014is New Haven. Durham isn't perfect either, but New Haven is undoubtedly worse. If you stick to the campus, though, it definitely doesn't feel sketchy and your safety isn't actually at risk. Everything changes once you leave campus. And, for what it's worth, New Haven is better located than Durham; Boston and New York are each a 2\u20132.5-hour train ride away.\n\nWith respect to questions 2\u20133, I'd also add that I'm fairly confident that our Economics department is usually better regarded than Duke's, but I can't speak to our Mathematics department\u2014and I wouldn't be surprised if Duke math beat Yale math. When considering which school would offer better internship and research opportunities, be sure to consider department-specific factors in addition to the universities as a whole.",

Just like any city, you need to be aware of your surroundings, but the city has amazing food, museums, neighborhoods and more. You just need to be willing to step out of the Yale bubble to experience it (and you don\u2019t even have to step out that far).",

Through all of that, although I've been interacted with in uncomfortable ways, I've never been the victim of a crime and I do feel safe in New Haven, although I'd likely be less adventurous if I were a female student. For a city of its size, New Haven does have very nice parks, restaurants, and museums\u2014although they aren't particularly remarkable by other standards (save for the university-affiliated museums, which are actually quite special).\n\nDifferent sources offer wildly differing accounts of how New Haven's crime rate compares to the national average, but what I do know is that most crime in New Haven is targeted\u2014and not toward Yalies ([here's an interesting article on that topic from The Atlantic last year](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/12/new-haven-connecticut-gun-violence/672504/)). I feel safer on campus than I do in just about any city.",

                            "comment": "Can speak a little more to the department comparisons.\n\nYale Econ is much more highly regarded than Duke Econ -- in graduate rankings, we hover in the top 4-7 range (the best departments at the graduate level are MIT &gt;&gt; Harvard &gt;= Stanford), while Duke hovers in the top 20. Because the faculty at Yale are very willing to work with undergraduates on things like research (lots of summer / semester long funding for this type of thing), this translates into a real difference at the undergrad level. \n\nMath is a closer comparison -- Yale is again the better graduate department (top 10 vs top 15-20), but teaching quality is fairly uneven. This is where I would expect Duke to have a possible advantage. On the other hand, Yale does run a summer REU (research experience for undergrads) that Yale students have easy access too, which is a huge plus for people thinking about grad school / wanting to get their toes wet with math research (normally REUs are *extremely* competitive to get, as they're a common source for rec letters in grad admissions). The math major cohort at Yale is also strong -- less so than at Harvard/MIT, but still very solid. Overall, I think you'll have more opportunities and better peer interactions as a math major at Yale than at Duke, but there may be some quality of life loss due to teaching (assuming Duke has good teaching -- you should ask around about this).",

            "comment": "Hi, Econ &amp; Math major here!\n\n1. It is very collaborative, both in academics and in general. Most classes have smaller discussion sections where you can get to know your classmates better, and working together on psets, etc is also encouraged. I've found that people are surprisingly very willing to help, be it by connecting you to professors or people they know, sharing opportunities, or just assisting you when you're confused. It is definitely very common to work together here, and especially at a niche major like Econ &amp; Math, everyone having very similar interests makes it even easier. Also want to plug this in: Yale is *extremely* strong for undergrad Econ, especially if you're a bit more academically inclined (which I assume you are since you're going for Econ &amp; Math instead of just Econ).\n2. It is very easy. Yale has two very well-structured programs for undergrad research in Econ (Tobin Undergrad Research Assistantships and Herb Scarf Summer Research Opportunities). Beyond these, you can also get Research Assistant positions directly with professors or be hired by labs, etc. Further, there is a ton of funding for independent research and there are SO MANY resources to help you.\n3. Definitely. Not sure which path you're into, but whether it's IB, consulting, quant, startups, etc, you're super well-positioned to get them. I know so many people who are going to top banks, MBB, quant, etc.\n4. My favorite thing is the gorgeous libraries and my least favorite thing is that we have brunch food for lunch on the weekends (I think most people actually like it, but I'm intl and it's stuff we don't really eat in my culture)",

Yale is much closer to NYC where you would be able to network/apply for the biggest finance roles. Although for most roles it would be splitting hairs to compare Duke and Yale, truth is there are some top firms that would absolutely prefer HPYSM on a resume instead of Duke; this is especially true if you want to land in PE as a long term goal",

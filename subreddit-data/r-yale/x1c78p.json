    "postText": "Hi! I am looking to exchange to Yale next Spring and I was wondering if I could connect with any Computing and the Arts student? I am a CS major but I am really interested in the art side of tech \u2013 3D modeling, creative coding and things like that. What classes from Computing and the Arts have you taken that are really unique and interesting, which conflates tech and art disciplines? Thank you!!",

            "comment": "Lol this is late but there are no computing and the arts classes. The CS and art departments are completely separate. The major is just taking half CS and half Art classes. There\u2019s some that have overlap but no classes specified as CPAR",

Could be anything related to academics, social life, places to visit in New Haven, profs/events you liked, research, things you wished you got more involved in, ... anything!\n\nFYI: incoming MPH student at YSPH but this would probably apply to the undergrads too!",

            "comment": "Well, I would've said to do a pre-ortientation program. I felt a little isolated early on at at Yale. Being involved in clubs helped with that, but the pre-ortientation programs seemed to do a great job of getting people adjusted socially. But now everyone does them so this advice is redundant lol.\n\nTaking notes ahead of class is probably my best advice though. I did a poor job of doing it, but it is way more helpful then going back after. Knowing what's going on when it's class, because you studied it before, is so so powerful",

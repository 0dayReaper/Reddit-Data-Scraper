    "postText": "Hi all, hope you are well. I know results are tomorrow but I was really curious about what this might mean. I got an email on the first week of March from CSS stating \u201c  Colleges have requested that you submit additional documentation for your 2023-24 financial aid application through IDOC  \u201d. I logged in IDOC and it was Yale requesting a Verification of Household Information. Before I got that email, I frequently checked IDOC and Yale's checklist and it always said that everything was complete. I submitted the verification form as soon as I got the email but I was wondering what this might entail.",

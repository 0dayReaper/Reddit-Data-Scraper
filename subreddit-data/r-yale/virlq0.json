    "postText": "Hi all, \n\nI'm a physics major, and I'm not sure if the grades I'm getting are good or not. \n\nThis might seem like I'm trying to humble brag but I swear I'm not. I'm just discouraged by how every other person in my classes are coming out with A's while I'm unable to even meet the average test sores. But when I bring this up to the professor, he says that my expectations for myself are too high and that I'm doing fine. \n\nSo, I'm not sure whether I should gauge myself based on my peers or based on what my professor is telling me. I'm also just now done with intro classes so I'm not sure if I should even go for higher level classes when I'm still struggling with the most basic courses for this major. \n\nIf there's any STEM major who has input on how I should measure whether I'm doing well enough or not, please lmk.",

            "comment": "No doubt physics is an extremely hard major, regardless of grades (or even somewhat the school one is attending).  Grades are curved, but that does mean that not everyone gets an A.  So don't be too hard on yourself.  You don't want to be struggling or failing obviously, but there is sometimes such intense pressure people put on themselves if they are getting a lower grade.\n\nStep back for a second -- do you enjoy the material and want to continue with the higher level courses?  What are your plans after undergrad?  Do you need to worry about grades for grad school or can you just focus on mastering the material to the best of your abilities?",

            "comment": "Did you just finish your first year? Second?\n\nAnecdotally (I'm not a physics major but knew many and took a few classes), Physics is one of the majors with the least grade inflation at Yale. So you should expect, and no one would be surprised, that your grades on average are not as good as those that your friends have in other disciplines. Job recruiters know this, so they'll be more forgiving about GPA. Generally, physics is an extremely employable major, as it's known to produce very capable people with an array of useful skills, from the theoretical stuff to the programming and statistics that you learn in labs and from doing research.\n\nIf you're thinking about graduate school, having high grades does unfortunately matter quite a bit, but every top grad school is forgiving when students don't have very good records in their first year, as they understand that people come from vastly different backgrounds and some have a hard time adjusting. That being said, I know many people who graduated from Yale and are now at top Physics grad programs who were very far from a 4.0, and this is standard.\n\nIt's definitely hard to see yourself be consistently below the average grade in the class. It's okay to put this somewhat on factors outside of your control (i.e., it's quite possible that many many people in your intro classes had a significantly stronger physics education than you in high school), but also you should really question how much work you've been putting into it and what you can possibly do to get better. \n\nPlease don't feel discouraged so far or think that you need perfect grades. If your professor thinks you're doing well, then you are; the invisible peer pressure of thinking your friends are doing better than you is not healthy, as pretty much nobody is actually getting all As the way you think.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a recent Yale grad who majored in physics and am now in grad school. To echo what other people said: it is a hard major, and physics majors\u2019 gpas tend to be on the lower end by Yale standards. But a couple of things to add: \n\nYou said you just finished the intro classes, so I\u2019m going to guess that you just finished your first year. Often, people\u2019s performance in the intro classes is more a reflection of what classes they took in high school/ how good their high school physics teacher was than their ability to succeed in the rest of the physics major. Things start to equalize a bit by the end of sophomore year, once you start taking classes with new material like quantum. \n\nSecond, a lot of the classes in the physics major (i.e. 410 and 430) reinforce the material you learned in intro physics. It\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t understand everything perfectly the first time! You will have the chance to revisit it later. The only thing that should determine what classes you take next is whether you find them interesting. Also, grades don\u2019t always reflect understanding\u2014 there are classes I got A\u2019s in and didn\u2019t realize until later that I had serious knowledge gaps in. \n\nThird, it sounds like it\u2019s a few years away for you, and you 100% don\u2019t have to know if you want to apply to grad school right now. But if you want to apply to grad school, grades are generally less important than your research experience and recommendations. And if you\u2019re really worried about your grades, you can do post-bacc research, which will help strengthen your application. \n\nLastly, imposter syndrome is extremely common at Yale, and extremely common in physics in general. Everyone experiences it at least sometimes. If you have any other questions about the physics major at Yale, feel free to dm me!",

    "postText": "So I was waitlisted from YYGS, which I am quite disappointed in because I live in the UK and so this was my only real chance to visit Yale without taking a whole international holiday just to visit and in general because I realllllly wanted to go.\n\nBut it has triggered a slight spiralling of 'if I can't get into YYGS how on earth will I get into Yale?' Obviously, a) not all Yale admits did YYGS and b) not all YYGS participants got into Yale, but I was wondering if anyone previously accepted to Yale had applied to YYGS and didn't get in. Hope this makes sense! Just would really like to talk through what my next steps should be + how you prepared to apply for Yale after this kind of rejection.\n\nAlso very sorry if I sound like I'm being overdramatic. I 100% realise summer programmes etc aren't everything I just so wanted to go lol. (also I'm not giving up hope quite yet... fingers crossed a space will open up!)",

From your point of view it\u2019ll feel very nerve racking but understand to keep applying no matter how discouraging",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm currently in Engl 114 and was wondering how final grades are calculated, since essays only seem to be given letter grades. Also, how is participation graded; is it based on your performance with respect to other students, or do the majority just get an A/A- as long as they show up and put in effort? Thank you!",

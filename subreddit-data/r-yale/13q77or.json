            "comment": "Hey! \n\nFirst, stop freaking out. I just finished my first year and this time last year I was doing the same thing, but you shouldn't. (Sorry this turned out so long, but I hope it is at least somewhat helpful) \n\nCourse registration doesn't start for first years until like the the week classes begin. But, you can start browsing the catalog now. \n\nCoursetable.com is the best way to do this. It's a student run platform that gives you ratings about classes and workload, as well as the professors. So if you want to find easy classes, this is the place to do it. \n\nRight now, if you want to get started (which you really don't need to if you don't want to), just look through and note anything that sounds interesting or fun, or anything that makes you say, hmm I think I might want to take this. You will probably end up with a super long list, but that's fine. \n\nWhen you get assigned a residential college, you will also get a FroCo, your first year advisor essentially. This person will help you narrow down your classes and find you a schedule that is best for you. Also, almost any upper classman you meet, whether through orientation programs or whatever, will want to help you. \n\nI would recommend looking at first year seminars. They tend to be more laid back and you can meet a bunch of cool first years. If you have a major in mind, you can look at prerequisites that you can get out of the way, but that isn't expressly necessary. And if you don't, then just choose bunch of stuff in different areas, and if possible try to knock out some requirements. Yale\u2019s requirements are not super specific, so in exploring, you can still accomplish a great deal. \n\nIf you have any questions, I would be more than happy to help. Good luck and enjoy the journey!",

            "comment": "You won't have to actually pick classes till during orientation. To  find out how hard/easy a class and professor is, go to course table. You don't need to focus on taking major specific courses unless you know you want to do something like a combined masters or some sort of hard double. However, I would take at least one class relevant to the major you want to explore if you actually like it at a college level. They will give you plenty advice about all this during orientation and there are also online meetings you can schedule with graduating seniors over the summer. Instructions should be in your email.",

    "postText": "Hi y\u2019all! I am an admitted student for the class of 2027, and while i\u2019m still deciding, Yale is in the lead for me rn. I wanted to ask, since my main \u201cthing\u201d in high school was writing for my schools newspaper, how often do students read the Yale student publications, and since there are so many, are they all relatively even is staffing and circulation, or are some far and away larger than others? I\u2019d assume that the YDN is one of if not the most popular, but what about the other dozen or so? and if you\u2019re a student who reads some of them regularly, what is your impression of them?\n\nThanks so much!",

It\u2019s just on another level.\n\nBut other publications got significant readership, too. The quality of the New Journal (Gay Talese-type stuff) was excellent. The Yale Record (humor) was generally passed around between suitemates because they printed fewer copies but it was always in demand. I mention those three specifically because I know professional writers who got their start with all those publications. It all depends on what you want to write, what kind of relationship you want with readers on campus, and what your aspirations are. Or you can just write for the fun of it! You could even start your own thing. It\u2019s pretty easy to get funding.",

The New Journal is more niche but has excellent writing \u2014 it\u2019s where the best English majors are.\n\nBesides the \u2018general interest\u2019 publications above, there\u2019s a massive number of more specialized magazines / pubs: The Globalist, the Politic, the Yale Scientific Magazine, etc. In general I would describe the ecosystem as very healthy and diverse.",

    "postText": "Hi I was accepted to yale REA and will be joining the class of 2026! I was just curious if anyone could give me advice on this.  I\u2019m planning on doing a double major in B.S. Engineering Sciences (Electrical) and African American studies.  On the website, it says that the engineering sciences (electrical) B.S is flexible and therefore many people choose to double major.  I would love to also have a major in African American studies but I don\u2019t know if it is truly doable.  Can anyone give me advice? Any info would help! Ty!",

You can always take the classes that interest you rather than just to meet the major requirements.  \n\nIf you want to be an electrical engineer someday, I would strongly recommend doing the ABET track. Simply put, it will make you faaarr more employable than the BS Engineering Sciences (Electrical) track. (Source: I am an ABET MechE alum).  \n\nThen again, I\u2019d you want to go to grad school for African American Studies, focus on that and take whatever EE classes sound interesting.  \n\nI promise you, having a paper that says you met two different sets of requirements isn\u2019t nearly as exciting as being a \u201cdouble major\u201d sounds",

            "comment": "The engineering major requires at least 4 prereqs (plus calc 1 and calc 2 equivalents if you don't have acceleration credits for those). After your 4-6 credits of prereqs you need to take at least 17 credits of major classes. These classes should also cover all of your QR and Science distributional requirements.\n\nThe African American studies requires 12 credits which should cover all of your Humanities, writing (probably), and maybe social science (definitely at least 1 of 2 credits) distributional requirements.\n\nThat's maybe all of your distributional requirements except language in at least 33 credits and at most 36 credits (if your AAS major only covers 1 social science).\n\nIf you're fluent in a language you need at least 1 credit of a language. If you're starting from scratch or place into L2 you need at least 4.5 credits of a language. L3: 3 credits L4: 2.5 credits.\n\nIf you cred/d/fail a class it probably won't count towards your major requirements (maybe 1 or 2 in AAS, EE is doubtful) and definitely won't count towards distributional requirements.\n\nRequired graduation credits are 36 at 4.5 credits/semester average (probably what you'll want to do). If you do 36 credits that gives you at most 2 credits to explore outside of major and distributional requirements. It's doable, but leaves you very little room to explore or cred/d any classes. Of course you don't have to declare until the end of your sophomore year and can walk through this in greater depth with your dean\n\nEdit: forgot to include language requirement in exploration credits.",

            "comment": "I would say probably, but you don't really need to and probably shouldn't.  There is zero overlap between the two subjects in terms of the courses, which in someways makes it easier to satisfy distributional requirements (everything but your language credit probably falls within the major requirements of the two), but a true double major will either make you write a thesis combining the two subjects or two theses, and the requirements will probably take up a lot of your credits anyway.  Part of the beauty of Yale is that you can take a lot of different classes in different areas if they interest you because there's no core curriculum, no universally required classes and relatively low distributional requirements.  If you find that you aren't really interested in other subjects beyond EE and AfAm, then maybe the double major suits you, but there's little upside to having it on your resume, and a large opportunity cost to going through with it.",

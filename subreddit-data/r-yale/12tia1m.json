My family was not in the $250k bracket, but I brought in my Yale, Princeton, and Duke FA offers with the latter two being significantly more generous. The receptionist took a look and asked me \u201cis cost the determining factor in attending Yale?\u201d and I said yes. Then she said \u201cwe\u2019ll make it work, keep an eye on your email\u2026welcome to Yale\u201d. Perhaps less effective for already enrolled students, but it\u2019s worth a shot given the potential upside. I found the office staff to be people that genuinely wanted to help. \n\n-\tclass of 2015",

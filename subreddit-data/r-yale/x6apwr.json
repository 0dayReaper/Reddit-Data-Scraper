    "postText": "Hi friends. I was thinking of posting this on r/ApplyingToCollege but I figured it'll be more apt to be posted here.\n\nI'm under the impression (please correct me if I'm wrong), that while school ranking isn't everything, there is just an unmatched level of support and resources at top tier universities like Yale. Academics-wise and culture-wise, different top schools may provide different experiences, which will undeniably change someone in a different way.\n\nNow, in terms of fit which is something applicants have to discover themselves, would you say the resources/support that Yale gives is immense to the point of 'life-changing'? \n\n* i.e. how much are you willing to sacrifice to get into Yale now that you're here and see the actual impact/benefits that being to Yale brings you?\n* Would you then say the support is so significant that it almost definitely outweighs a Top 15 Asia university? (I'm asking because there's a T15 uni in my country \u2014 I'm an intl')\n\nAnyways, I'm sure there are many factors at play but I'm really happy to hear any thoughts from the Yale community!",

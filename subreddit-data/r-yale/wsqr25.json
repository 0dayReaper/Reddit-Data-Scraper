I\u2019m also taking MATH 115, ENGL 114, and HUMS 029. Is there anyone on here who\u2019s taken this lab and can tell me if it\u2019s worth my time, what the workload is like, etc.? Thank you!",

Got a 46% on the first major lab report\n\n\nHalf of my class including myself dropped within the first few weeks",

            "comment": "Wouldn't recommend it. As someone else stated, lab goes overtime a lot. The intro bio sequence should be a prerequisite to that lab because the intro bio sequence teaches things at a slower pace than the lab, so you will be expected to know things in the lab that haven't even been taught in your bio class yet. Also, the rubrics are really annoying, and the teacher scrutinizes your paper as if you're proposing a cure to cancer, which is something I expect you won't be used to as a freshman. Most people taking the class were juniors and seniors (with a few sophomores) who had plenty of lab experience, and a good number of them dropped it. Enjoy your first year.",

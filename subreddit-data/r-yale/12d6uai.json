    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019ll be visiting Yale from NYC for an event. It looks like I take the Metro North from Grand Central and then get off at Union Station. Would you recommend walking or taking a car to campus? My event is at Sterling Memorial Library and the event is on a weekend if that makes a difference. I\u2019ve also never been to Yale so I\u2019d love to explore a bit if I have time but I\u2019m not sure what will be open for public. Thank you in advance!",

But they are way behind what they were saying it was going to be right before. And the closed to public date of March 2020 that they give is incorrect. They may have kept it open for students until that time, but they closed the museum to the general public in December 2019.\n\nETA: I just went back and looked at photos I took the day of our visit, November 30, 2019. They had a sign out front advertising December 7 as Community Day, saying, \u201cCome celebrate with us \u2026 say farewell before the great hall closes January 1.\u201d It was clear to us when we visited that they would not admit the general public to the museum past the end of the year. I don\u2019t think I took a photo of a sign exactly to that effect at the time. My main focus was on seeing exhibits and taking pictures of those.",

Undergrad from Yale originally from NYC so I commute like every month, but I have found three strategies: 1) Uber/Lyft about $10 2) Yale Shuttle but it is kind of confusing because their lines switch different days of the week and times of day but I find the third most useful 3) There is public transport, the bus/ union station shuttle right outside the train station that takes you to the New Haven Green, it is one stop only so once you get off you are one block away from old campus, it is about three blocks from Sterling Library!

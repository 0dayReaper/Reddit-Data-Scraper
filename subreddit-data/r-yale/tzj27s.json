    "postText": "I\u2019ve been so grateful to get opportunities at many top universities, but I have no idea how I\u2019m going to choose, maybe you can help me out. I\u2019m a high school senior, premed, what\u2019s most important to me are research, study abroad opportunities, student experience- specifically for a queer Black woman, and variety of classes and professors. I don\u2019t want to end up in a super competitive environment of premeds, I\u2019d prefer a collaborative and supportive environment, and ideally I\u2019d be in the Northeast (out of Cali where I grew up but near family in New England). I got into Yale, Stanford, Georgetown, Emory, Vanderbilt, Swarthmore, UPenn, and Tufts. Waitlisted at Harvard, Tulane, BU, and haven\u2019t heard from Howard. It\u2019s coming down to Yale and Emory, but I also love Vandy and Stanford. I got the Woodruff scholarship at Emory which covers everything that I would have to pay to the school (tuition, housing, meal plan, fees, study abroad costs + research funding) and the Cornelius Vanderbilt scholarship which covers tuition. Every school covered my \u201cneed\u201d as determined on the FAFSA SAR except Georgetown. I l would\u2019ve loved being in DC and getting the international relations focus from Georgetown (they\u2019re also the only school with a global health program that rivals Emory), but their financial aid offer was just ridiculous (included required loans and work study, 10k more than next school, and hearing other peoples offers from Gtown, I don\u2019t expect them to budge). Paying out expected family contribution would be doable but a real burden that would lower my parents quality of life. They\u2019re adamant about me not going into debt (at least before med school), and my mom works in public service, so any loans she takes out would be forgiven within 10 years, but my mom is 57, my dad 65, they deserve to retire, not to mention the fact that my little brother is in private school and will probably also be attending a private university (in 5 years after I graduate). From all of this, Emory probably seems like the clear choice, yet I can\u2019t bring myself to turn down Yale. When I visited all of these schools, I felt like I belonged, I could see myself happy as a student there. It was a little different at Yale, I saw myself challenged and mentally stimulated in a different way, the other schools felt like home but Yale felt almost like a utopia. I\u2019m trying to separate my feelings from the Ivy League concept, but even just being there felt like where I had to be. I don\u2019t want to miss out on a great undergrad experience to be focused on getting into med school, I also don\u2019t want to be surrounded by only one type of student. Part of me is worried that because Emory attracts students just like me (global health premeds with a research focus) that it would create a big fish small pond effect even though Yales academics may be more rigorous in areas. My plan is undergrad, MPH, med school, I could have opportunities to go to three separate universities not counting summers and exchange programs, there must be people who have turned down a scholarship at Emory for Yale and gone to Emory med and vice versa. how did that turn out? I\u2019ve seen forums with students also stuck between the two and the consensus is usually to save the money for med school and take the scholarship now. Unlike some of these students? I won\u2019t have 300k waiting for me when I graduate, I\u2019ll be applying for fellowships all over again. I\u2019ve heard that being at Yale increased my chances of receives future scholarships, but I\u2019ve also heard that being a scholarship recipient also increases my chances. Sorry this is so long, but I\u2019m really torn!",

            "comment": "First off, Congrats on all the incredible acceptances!\n\nIf Yale feels that good to you, tell them and see if they will up the financial aid, ask if they will match your other offers.  FYI, the research opportunities at Yale will be incredible.  As an undergrad you should be able to do research at the medical school, which would benefit your chances of getting into med school.  Med school acceptance is not guaranteed, no matter how high your gpa or MCATS.  \n\nDon't look down on FWS.  At most schools with FWS the on campus labs and facilities that hire you only have to pay half your wages.  They love that and it opens up opportunities that would not be there otherwise.  (also, although you do not want to take on debt, FWS can be converted into loans if you choose).  Also, there will not be as many work-study students at Yale as there would be at many other schools, so that will up your opportunities for good placements if you have FWS.  I go to a different Ivy, many jobs list FWS required, others will list FWS not required but preferred.  Trust me, having FWS really helps.  Doing research in a lab also really helps.  (Regarding loans, if you qualify there are federal subsidized loans which accrue no interest while you are attending school, the max presently allowed is about $5,550 a year.  They are a pretty good deal.  You can only get them as an undergraduate)  \n\nIf you want to go to med school, I would aim for that first.  A lot of med schools have dual MD/MPH programs.  Almost anyone can get into a masters program if they work hard, very few people can get into med school no matter how hard they work.  I would make that my #1 focus, other than doing well and enjoying your undergraduate years!  Also, masters programs cost money to attend, PhD's are funded, we are told at our school never to do a masters.  \n\nI'm not sure where you stand with financial aid needs because if your mom works in public service, she could have decent income, but...Many top med schools are tuition free if you have the need.  If you can afford it, then you are going to pay.  NYU advertised the free med school tuition thing a few years ago to up their standing.  The big schools had it all along.  They don't advertise because the don't need to, thousand apply regardless.  Do your research on that.  Yale is one of them.  So, unless your parents can afford it, you will not be paying $300,000 for a med school education if you get into the top tier (which BTW, is no easy task!) \n\nAlso, I don't want to be rude here, but most students going to med school do not have \"the $300,000 waiting for them\" to go.  To think that is a little foolish and may not serve you well.  If someone in a position of to help you (for a letter of rec, etc.) heard you say that they might be turned off, because you are definitely not the only person who will be applying to or going to med school with need.   \n\nAlso, FYI, Yale Medical School is known for being the first to introduce a cooperative, non competitive med school environment, have you read their history?  If not so, you will be impressed.  There are some other schools on your list with incredible medical schools, Stanford, Vanderbilt, Tufts.  You've got some great choices.  I'd say go with your heart.  Being happy with where you are has a big impact on your success.   Good Luck!",

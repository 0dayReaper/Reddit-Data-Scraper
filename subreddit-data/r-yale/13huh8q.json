Im planning on applying for a PLUS parent loan and it says I have till the end of June to apply for it but I remember seeing something on the Yale website that it was May 19. Im still trying to figure this stuff out since I want to ensure I make the right decisions but I would love anyone's advice/input on how loans work for Yale. Thank you!",

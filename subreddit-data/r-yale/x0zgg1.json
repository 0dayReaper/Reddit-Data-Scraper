    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m a 21yo from India who is really interested in International relations and absolutely love the Global affairs program offered by the Jackson School. I have graduated in History (with a GPA of 7.608/10 or 72% ) from the best college in my country for history at the undergraduate level. I have also interned at a few places, including leading Think tanks in India, SAARC and international organisations like JPAL. I also have a rich extracurricular background in film making and video editing. \n\nI understand that the course is suited for mid-career professionals as the website mentions, as well as the small size of the Masters class. I wanted to ask, should I apply what is the likelihood of my application being accepted? \n\nSide note: I am yet to give my GRE, would receiving a high score in the same increase my chances?",

    "postText": "Hi! I've just found out that you can't apply for a Yale undergraduate degree if you already hold a undergrad degree from a different uni. I'm currently doing an undergrad in Australia and been wanting to apply to Yale for a different degree once I've finished this one. \n\nI'm just wondering what the reason is for this? \n\nThanks :))",

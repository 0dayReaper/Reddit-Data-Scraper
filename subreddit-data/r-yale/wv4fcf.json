    "postText": "Hello, prospective student here!  Yale is my dream school, but I'm also applying to Brown, which I adore as well because the open curriculum is really important to me.  I have a ton of interests I want to explore and learn more about in college that don't have a lot to do with my intended major, and I was wondering how easy it is to do that at Yale, and if anyone has any tips/personal experiences.  I've heard good things, but I'd love to hear from all points of view.  Thank you so so much for your time!  Wishing everyone a smooth move-in week!!",

You can get into basically anything if you wait it out.\n\nMost other courses, especially lectures, are really easy to take. The only exception is specialty courses required for majors you aren\u2019t in, such as some art classes, classes with eminent professors, and upper level history/English seminars. \n\nThat being said, all in all you have tons of flexibility. As an ecologist I was able to take courses in archaeology, art history, collections research, metal casting, food, and firefighting. Some were difficult to get into but I was only rejected from a class I really wanted to take once or twice.",

            "comment": "There are almost no restrictions on classes outside your major. That's especially true because you don't even *have* a major (or at least not one that's locked in) until your Junior year.\n\nThe only exceptions are going to be for super highly competitive seminars and for extremely high-level courses. For the seminars: it's just a matter of space (but there are still a ton of seminars where that won't be an issue). For the high-level ones, it's going to be that the prerequisites just aren't going to be something you have unless you're in that major or something very close to it.\n\nIn four years, I only felt restricted based on my major once. And that wasn't even a hard restriction; it was a seminar that said essentially \"There are 14 spots; 7 are reserved for in-major, 2 for fresh/sophs who intend to be in the major, and 5 open.\"",

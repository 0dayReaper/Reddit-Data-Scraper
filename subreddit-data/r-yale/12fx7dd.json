    "postText": "Hello! My name is Spencer and I just got a summer internship in Stratford CT. I was hoping to sublet from a Yale student somewhere in the New Haven area. My requests to join the off-campus housing groups are pending. I would ideally like a spot with parking and within walking distance from either of the train stations. I can go solo or with a roommate from June - August.\n\nThanks so much, Spencer.",

I guess the best location for you would be downtown, but you may struggle with parking in a location like that. \n\nIf you can't find anything with parking, monthly passes to the car parks downtown aren't particularly expensive, so that is also an option.",

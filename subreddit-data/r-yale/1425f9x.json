    "postText": "hi everyone!\n\nso i dont rlly like to use being FGLI as an excuse for not knowing stuff or being behind but not having someone to ask abt this stuff has me damn near panic attacks and I've never even had anxiety or anything like that lol, but the more I research the more confused and behind I feel. so I just have some questions and if there's any other information you wanna add it would be *very greatly* appreciated. also if there's a better place to be asking these questions, please let me know! i know we'll be getting frocos but besides them lol.\n\n\\- should I take math 112, 115, or 120 as a first year? do I only need to take one math class? if I do take math 112, can I stop there/is that sufficient for pre med requirements? \n\n\\- if I don't take organic chem my first year, will I have to take a gap year?\n\n\\- what ecs should I be doing/what ecs did you do?\n\n\\- how do I get involved with research, do I just cold email? should I be doing that right now? should I be researching during the year or just the summer?\n\n\\- have any pre meds studied abroad, how did you go about it? can you research abroad? \n\n\\- what were the classes you took throughout college or in your first year as a pre med?\n\n\\- how can I prepare for my classes? are the syllabi posted?\n\n\\- how are you getting your patient care hours? during the summer? school year? where?\n\n\\- how many hours of volunteering, shadowing, and patient care-related job did you have?\n\n\\- is there a place to find courses/professors for next year? i know course selection hasn't opened yet but I want to try and see ahead of time. \n\nthanks everyone!",

            "comment": "Lol everyone has those questions. My advice is read every single line of the premed catalog. It\u2019s all in there. As for courses, coursetable is the go to. study abroad is not related to whether you\u2019re in premed or not. You don\u2019t study abroad your first year typically. Look into grants and study abroad for that (also on the catalog). ECs no one gives a shit",

            "comment": "hey darlin - fellow anxious premed here. i had a lot of these same questions when i was a first-year. here's how i would answer them now:\n\n1. what math class you take as a first-year will depend on your placement test results. i took 116 and really liked it; there's a lot of debate about whether 115 or 116 is better for premeds - happy to chat more about that if you like.\n2. no! i took orgo my sophomore year and so did most of my premed friends.\n3. whatever you want. like truly - there will be people who disagree with me on this one, but the best extracurriculars for you are the ones you're the most passionate about. for premeds, that will often include volunteering at yale new haven hospital or haven free clinic, but it can also include anything from sports to music.\n4. you shouldn't worry about research yet - you'll want to get your bearings with academics and extracurriculars first. there are a ton of opportunities for research once you're on campus!\n5. yes you can study abroad - most premeds who choose to go abroad will do a summer rather than a semester.\n6. everyone's classes vary a bit, and it'll largely also depend on your major. the gen chem and intro bio sequences are the most important for first years (many take the intro bio courses off-sequence, but you should at least start the sequence in your spring semester).\n7. most syllabi aren't posted yet - you'll start getting canvas messages around early august!\n8. summers are the best for getting a lot of hours quickly, but haven free clinic, ct hospice, and ynhh are all good year-round opportunities.\n9. i haven't graduated yet so can't give a super great answer on this - so far i'm at roughly 200 hours, but will be getting a lot more this summer through an internship.\n10. once you've got your net id, you can use coursetable to look at courses and profs!",

            "comment": "ECs people actually care at times- patient care hours can come through volunteering at a hospital, working as a PCA, CNA, MA, or scribe. Any of which can be done in an office or at a hospital. Shadowing I would email doctors- if your family knows any at home email them and do it at home! Research can also boost an application and that would just be dependent on ur personal passions!",

Also, math116 is advertised to premed students as a more bio-related math115, but it is more difficult (somewhere between math115 and math120 from my experience)",

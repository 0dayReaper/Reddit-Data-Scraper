    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nTL;DR: How happy are Yalies?\n\nHaving been accepted to a few places (including Yale) with likely letters, I'd appreciate your help with choosing my college. From my perspective, at creme de la creme schools like HYPSM, it's unlikely that I'd get any significant financial/success advantage out of choosing one school over another. It'd seem like I can control for the future outcome and simply pick the school that makes me the happiest. From your experience, does Yale provide an environment where I can stress less (well, relative to other top schools) and form close relationships with friends (while not flunking classes)?\n\nThanks for your help!",

I'm over the moon excited to attend.\n\nCan confirm, Harvard is a mixed bag when it comes to happiness and there is definitely truth to some of the horror stories. I don't find Harvard cut throat competitive, but students here push themselves to the limit, so if you don't also do that.. you're kind of looked down upon. The suffering Olympics are VERY real here. I've seen students have complete meltdowns over getting a B+ in organic chemistry. Students overcommit an obscene amount and subsequently flake a lot. I've lost friends because they're so wrapped up in their work that they don't make an effort in their friendships unless it's convenient (i.e, you help each other on homework). \n\nThat said, I do have to defend that Harvard has some amazing qualities, in terms of the quality of classes, the teaching fellows, academic opportunities and support, and you're surrounded by people who inspire you. I couldn't imagine having better friends. So long as you recognize if and when you need support for academics and mental health, you'll be alright, and I think that applies to most universities.",

Dance, music, improv, and a capella and stuff like that super popular and light-natured, but there's also a lot of other stuff too. IMs, traditions, events are big. Id say it's less cutthroat by a noticeable margin, and I've only gotten that vibe from classes with really harsh curves. And for as much weve complained about it as a student body, our dining halls are well above average based on seeing students from other ivys visit. \n\nIt also depends on the major you're picking. Ultra stemmy majors have a bad habit of having too many major requirements, and courses which cover too much. For example, our math 120 ( calc 3) is notorious for covering a fuck ton more, for no reason, even when compared to other ivys. Compsci and chemical engineering have crazy course loads. But all of the  stem departments are much better than their reputations ( compared to similar schools) suggest.",

Don\u2019t give up hope, but also if you got deferred from Yale that means you\u2019ve already achieved something pretty extraordinary in your life. This result, however unfavorable is an indicator of your future success. Regardless of the final outcome, you have the skillset and dedication to make it work!",

You should probably send in a letter of continued interest and then really try to occupy yourself w regular decisions for other colleges. Obviously you still have a change of getting in but there isn\u2019t much you can do so it\u2019s best to work on the other applications and things in your life you can control and try to enjoy the rest of your senior year if you can. Good luck I really hope you get in! \ud83d\udc99",

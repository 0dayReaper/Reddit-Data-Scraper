Yale School of Management\n\nThe aid covers the tuition but what things are looked at while determining eligibility is what I wish to understand. Thanks a bunch!",

            "comment": "Your best bet would be to contact the financial aid officers for each program, they're generally responsive and transparent about what documentation/criteria are looked at. I'd do it now, since they'll probably be busier once applications start coming in. I'm in a different graduate school, but they were pretty clear about what I needed to submit and what they looked at. At least for my school, they look at your parents' income and assets regardless of your age, and you'll need to get documentation stating estrangement if you don't want your parents' info to be considered.",

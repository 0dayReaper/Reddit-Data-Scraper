    "postText": "Hello students of Yale. This post is to invite ya'll to join our anarchy server. The server was started a day or 2 ago by Cornell students, but we are now extending it to some other ivy league schools. The server is complete anarchy, the only rules being that you are not allowed to use speed/fly hacks. If you're interested in joining, the IP is: ~~34.68.157.182~~\n\n**UPDATE:**\nThe anarchy server is closing, but the world download is being sent by the current owner to the owner of another Cornell run Minecraft server. In the coming days, they will be running the anarchy world, in addition to a regular survival, and creative world. I will make a new post once the anarchy world is up again.\nThe new IP is:\n147.135.68.19:25578\nThe server is running in 1.15.2\n\nThe discord server is:\nhttps://discord.gg/btHTQZH\n\n\nAdditionally, I am not the owner of the server, but he gave me permission to invite other schools.  Enjoy!!",

    "postText": "okay so im so confused right now because when i try to look up how much dorms are gonna be they give me the annual amount. so my question is, do i pay monthly or all at once? and if it is monthly do i divide it by 12 months ($875) or 9 months ($1166). \n\nthe meal plan is also mandatory??? i cant afford to pay $7950 for food? cant i just tell them that i don\u2019t want the meal plan or that i can\u2019t afford it?",

The only thing to add is that if you want to pay gradually over the semester you have to sign up for the payment plan well in advance, otherwise you have to pay in full at the start of the semester.",

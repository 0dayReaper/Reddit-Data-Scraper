For my first time getting there, I\u2019m gonna fly to JFK airport and then take an Amtrak to NHV Union Station. Any suggestions on a better method?",

            "comment": "Metro North is a cheaper train than Amtrack between New Haven &amp; New York. You can use public transport (i.e., the New York subway system) to get from JFK to Grand Central Station.\n\nFor another option, the airline Avelo has very cheap flights directly to New Haven\u2026.but only from places on the east coast. If you fly into Nashville, Ft Lauderdale, Philly, DC, etc you can maybe find a very cheap Avelo flight from there directly to New Haven and skip the train.",

The advantage of Metro North is that you don't have to buy in advance -- just buy your ticket right before you board and it will be $17.75 off-peak and $23.50 peak (until they raise fares again).  Amtrak got real cheap during the pandemic, but the walk-up fares vary a lot -- you might get lucky with a $17 fare on a low-demand train, but it could also go over $100.",

Hours are limited, and the buses/trains are low-frequency, but you can take the 24 bus from BDL to either the Windsor or Windsor Locks train station, or the 30 bus from BDL to downtown Hartford, and then the Hartford Line train from any of those stations to New Haven.  There are more trains from Hartford than the other two stations.  If you have time to kill in Windsor, you can walk a couple blocks and get some mofongo.  If you have time to kill in Hartford, you can experience how dead it is so you will appreciate New Haven more.  But I only do this when I don't have much in the way of bags and I have a couple extra hours to waste.",

I was spoiled by comping from Seattle, where you can either drive to SeaTac in 30 min, or take the light rail directly to and from. \n\nGetting to an airport in NY or the New Jersey NWK one takes at least 2-3 hours each way. First get to the station, then take the train, then take the subway if you\u2019re trying for  NY airport. Or she\u2019ll out an extra 50-100$ to take Amtrack cuz it\u2019s the fastest\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s just a nightmare. Three of us tried to fly out to the west coast. 2 of the 3 missed their flights because either the train was delayed, or the subway was. \n\nJust be prepared, it sucks and takes forever.",

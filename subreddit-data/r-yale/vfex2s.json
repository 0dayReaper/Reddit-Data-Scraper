    "postText": "Hi, I'm a prefrosh trying to figure out how course scheduling works.  I read somewhere that doing DS leaves only 1 open class my freshman year, and looking at the first year seminars, I found some of them interesting but wanted to know if they are recommended for someone who is already in several seminars a week. Should I look for non-seminar classes to get more variety in my freshman year courses? Also, am I right in thinking that enrollment for specific DS class times will only open in August?",

If you're okay taking a fourth writing-intensive class and are interested in the subject, why not apply?  \n\n\nWhen I did DS two years ago, we didn't choose sections. We were just assigned.",

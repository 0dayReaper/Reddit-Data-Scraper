    "postText": "I come from a fairly uncompetitive environment so transitioning to Yale was definitely a huge culture shock in the first place. Idk, there\u2019s just something sad about watching people drop all their passions to pursue a career in finance/medicine/cs soley for the pay. It\u2019s also shocking to see people who already have incomprehensible amounts of wealth and privilege openly talk about making more whether that means a goldman internship or a jane street convention.\n\nAlthough i\u2019m not low income myself, I spent all my life in low income schools and areas so a part of me feels like it\u2019s my burden to make society better and forget about the money to \u201catone.\u201d Meanwhile my peers who are more privileged than myself only care about climbing the ladder and making more money which frankly just seems selfish. I know it\u2019s wrong to think this way but I can\u2019t help it. Has anyone else delt with this?",

            "comment": "Listen, I was a lot like you when I was in school. (I'm almost 40 now.) I thought I was so much better than everyone doing finance/consulting/etc. While everyone went to recruiting events and stressed out about interviews, I sat back and complained about people selling their souls. \n\nMy family was never 'we don't have enough to eat' poor, but I was low-income enough that I went to school on a full scholarship, at a time when the cut-off was much less than it is now. I thought it was my responsibility to give back to the world. And I did, for about ten years. Guess what, I ended up poor and struggling throughout my 20s, watching as my \"sell-out\" peers flourished. And my job at a nonprofit? Great some days, full of infighting and politics and purity tests on others. \n\nIn my early 30s, I got tired of career instability, went to law school, and graduated into corporate law. It turns out, I LOVE it. I probably actually would've liked finance (insofar as you can like it) back in the day. Meanwhile, one of my college friends, who did go into finance, quit a few years ago with enough money to semi-retire, and now owns a cat sanctuary in Washington. \n\nAll this is to say that life is long, if you're lucky. Who a person is today is not necessarily who they'll be tomorrow. Try not to judge others, you have no idea what their lives are like or where any of yours are going to lead.",

Have enough money and you will be invited to all the non-profit parties, not to mention Yale itself to woo you for this board and that conference. (They won't woo any working nurses or social workers.)\n\nAlso, I don't know if you're white, but many do-gooders are white people with trust funds - doing good is a lot easier when you never have to worry.

In that time, I\u2019ve gained a lot of perspective on different career paths, selling out, etc. \u2014 some of my big learnings:\n\n1 - Finance/medicine/CS tend to be high-paying but they do contribute to society. For example, most investors (even hedge funds, venture capital, etc.) are investing money from pension funds, retirement plans, etc. It\u2019s not a bad thing to go into finance and maximize retirement savings for average people.\n\n2 - To make a big impact on anything, you need to have the right skills, and the private sector is a good place to develop them. My own path has been finance -&gt; consulting -&gt; tech -&gt; climatetech. I\u2019m glad to now be working on a problem that obviously matters to society, but every job I had before this one equipped me to do what I\u2019m doing today, and I have no doubt that I\u2019m able to make a bigger impact because of what I learned earlier in my career.\n\n3 - Time flies. When I was in my early 20s, money didn\u2019t seem so important, but that\u2019s because I could more than cover what I needed as a single person (and I was lucky enough not to need to support family members). Now that I\u2019m in my early 30s, I occasionally wish I\u2019d stuck it out longer in finance because I\u2019d have more savings now and be able to better provide for a family. I\u2019m not going to be homeless by any means, but having a higher income could make the difference between private or public school for a kid, being able to hire a nanny so that I can continue my career, being able to pay for my kid to go to Yale one day, and so on.\n\n4 - Even people who come from a lot of wealth may not have immediate access to that wealth, and even if they do, they may want to prove to themselves that they could go it alone.\n\nUltimately everyone needs to figure out what values they want to live by, and if you want to pursue a mission-driven career from the outset, that\u2019s fantastic and something to be admired. But I wanted to share why the other perspective can be valid too.",

Whenever I find myself going down this path, though, I always remember one of my favorite movies, *Good Will Hunting.* Essentially, the film is about this twenty-year-old blue-collar worker who is discovered to be a math prodigy. A major point of conflict in the film is Will having to choose between chasing a lucrative office offer (and leave his friends behind, as a result) or  remaining a janitor and construction worker for the rest of his life. One of the best scenes in the film is when Will's best friend tells him that he and any of the construction site workers would do *anything* to have Will's opportunities, and that it would be insulting if Will didn't take the job offers. \n\nAlthough I understand your frustration with people \"dropping their passions\" for money, I think that you need to remind yourself of your current position. Not only are you going to college, which is a luxury in itself, but you are also going to one of the top universities in the world. Frankly, very few people can observe or appreciate the academic and career-oriented opportunities you have at Yale-- the people who are chasing internships are just cashing out their winning lottery ticket. While I understand that you have good intentions with wanting to make society better, most people don't even have the luxury to choose between more or less lucrative career paths. As someone who is low-income and grew up in low-income schools, I highly doubt that any of my peers would have resented you for prioritizing money over passion, as they would likely do the same in your position.",

As patients, we've all experienced those doctors who were only in it for the money or because of family pressure/prestige. I can't tell you how many people I've met who say they became a doctor because their parents demanded doctor or lawyer -- pick one. It's never nice being on the receiving end of a doctor with no bedside manner, who is only there because of expectations / money/ fill in the blank. If you don't love to help heal people because you care about them, then please go into a different field to care about yourself. Anything but medicine.",

Maybe people just want to maintain the high standard of living they grew up with, or maybe they\u2019re using money as a proxy of where they can add the most value. Or maybe they haven\u2019t thought about it and a conversation with you will put them on a different path. Who knows?",

I was FGLI and mentored younger FGLI kids, and I encouraged everyone to go into high-paying industries. Get the bag, take care of your family, simple. \n\nI don\u2019t think these wealthy kids are choosing to get jobs to earn a lot of money (or at least it\u2019s not a primary motivating factor). I think it\u2019s almost entirely driven by the prestige of landing a lucrative job at a well-known firm. Hell, even I was driven partially by prestige, and I desperately needed the money that comes with a solid job lol. They want to be able to boast about where they work/what they do, and have their parents boast about where they work, just like their parents can boast to their friends about their kid going to Yale. If not for the prestige, I can\u2019t understand why a trust fund kid would go into a job working 60-100 hours with very little vacation time.\n\nSadly, low-income college kids are wildly underrepresented at the top finance/consulting firms. Like you mentioned, it\u2019s a lot of wealthy students who are able to get the highest paying internships and jobs. This is probably due to having white collar parents who either taught them about the industries early on or had connections in the industries.",

I don't think you can make it through pre-med, med school and everything that comes after that if all you care about is the money. Or maybe you can, but it would be very difficult. Most medical professionals I know become very invested in their patients; they work long hours to help them and save their lives. During the pandemic they put their own lives at risk to help people who were suffering from the virus. That right there requires a certain amount of unselfishness. Also, I think it's easy to say you can \"forget about the money\" if you already have money to fall back on or if you have family who will help you. You can pursue any career you want, but it's not \"whoring\" to want to make a lot of money. Money pays for healthcare, housing, your family's needs, education, etc. So don't be so quick to assume that the people who want to make a lot of money are only doing it for selfish reasons. Some are, but not all of them.",

Yale students are bright and driven. We need these students to take these roles, because they are some of the most demanding and important. There is a reason they are so well compensated.",

It\u2019s allowed us to limit the amount of soldiers the US needs to send for ground combat. Try to expand your perspective beyond your preconceived notions of good and evil. At Yale, you most certainly will be challenged to do so. \n\nWar is never something we should seek, but sometimes it\u2019s unavoidable. Look at the conflict on Ukraine for instance. I\u2019m sure Ukrainian freedom fighters would love to deploy these drones against Russian invaders.",

Yale is located in new haven, one of the poorest cities in Connecticut, but I doubt privileged wealthy yale students care enough about the children being gunned down outside their college campus to actually use what they\u2019re learning to do something about it. You know why? It\u2019s human nature. Everyone has a certain degree of selfishness. We\u2019re like animals. We\u2019re selfish to survive. If young kids are being shot to death outside of the most prestigious campus on earth, why should they care? They don\u2019t. Oh well. \n\nIt\u2019s a sick world we live in. A lot of Yale students got in because of their mommy and daddies money and they\u2019ll never experience poverty. Neither will their kids or grandkids. Meanwhile, the kids who\u2019s families have never known luxury due to things like America\u2019s legacy of slavery will die in the streets right outside of Yale\u2019s campus. \n\nHowever, I believe in God, so I\u2019ll trust God to give every selfish wealthy Yale student exactly what they deserve. He\u2019ll take those dead children outside your campus and make them so safe and secure that they\u2019ll never worry about bullets again, and he\u2019ll take those same Yale students and give them exactly what they deserve forever. \n\nAnd I\u2019m not talking about all Yale students, just the ones you\u2019re talking about.",

I agree with others that this is a nuanced issue. If you all read closer, this response is not a blanket condemnation of Yale or Yale students, but of greed, selfishness, and immorality. It\u2019s not a condemnation of wealthy or elite \u201cYalies\u201d, but of the wealthy and elite chained by the convictions of their fathers before them\u2026 newer generations that don\u2019t break the cycle. And trust me, as a Yale student, I see so many so-called wealthy and \u201celite\u201d Yalies who ARE breaking that cycle. I cannot wait to see the tomorrow we find ourselves in when we get to see them out in the world. But damn, Greenbean\u2019s post here is actually something. It needs to be read closer. It needs to be published!! It has a razor sharp edge that cuts deep. Don\u2019t scroll past it before allowing yourself to absorb the underlying message!!!",

There are certainly selfish and socially corrosive forms, but to assume that everyone who goes into finance (or tech) is just doing it for the money oversimplifies human motives. It matters how you make it and then what you do with it when you have it. There are also many people who have \u201cvirtuous\u201d motives (artists, teachers, community organizers for example) who may have a \u201chigher calling\u201d but don\u2019t end up making a socially beneficial impact. The opportunity that Yale creates for its students just makes career choices difficult because there are so many options, many of them lucrative - what matters is what you end up doing with that opportunity, not that the lucrative ones are inherently bad.",

    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nTLDR: Statistics/Applied Math student deciding between HYS. Any input is appreciated.\n\nI didn't wanna post this on A2C cuz a lot of people are depressed from the decisions and don't wanna hurt them. But long story short, I've narrowed my college choice down to Harvard, Yale, and Stanford. I don't think I can pick based on prestige at this level (though many would say Harvard is slightly above the other 2). As of now, I don't know what career I wanna pursue or if I plan to go to graduate school. I've talked with a few Stanford students, and they say that the math professors there are unfriendly, which kinda pushes me toward Harvard and Yale. I really just want to have a good 4-year experience and excellent opportunities post-grad. Would you say that the latter is equally true for all three schools?\n\nWould you mind giving me the Pros and Cons of studying Applied Math / Stats at Yale?",

If you can, visit each for the vibe check. That's how I decided Yale :)",

Yale\u2019s stats department is genuinely phenomenal in theoretical stats / mathematical statistics, so the PhD level courses tend to be very good (and students at Yale who take them do excellently in Stats PhD admissions).\n\nThe faculty is sparser for applied stats though (although they\u2019re fairly aggressively hiring to try to fix this), so the classes that most undergrads actually take for things like the stats certificate usually don\u2019t have the best teaching. This is exacerbated by the fact that stats has become *extremely* popular among students recently as a way to signal quantitative ability (ex. doing Econ and Stats instead of just Econ), so class sizes can be large.\n\nTl;dr how \u2018phoned in\u2019 Yale stats is depends a lot on the courses you take. Most math majors would enjoy the more theoretical courses where Yale excels, but it\u2019s not for everyone. Feel free to dm for more info.",

These haven't been intro courses but they haven't been PhD level.  In one course, the prof left us to grade each other's final exams, promising a system of oversight to make sure we didn't screw each other.  Then he went back on his promise, assigned everyone the median score of their three peer reviewers (mine graded completely bullshit) and then ignored every single email sent.  All three classes have had very dry lecturing, psets copied from textbooks with wild differences in length and difficulty.  The professors feel very inaccessible.",

It also has a 3 class language requirement, distributional requirements in writing and humanities courses, sciences, etc. I forgot what the other schools ask for but when I was picking schools I compared based on how the schools compare to the Yale 36 credit model.",

Most of the answers seem to be pro-Yale which makes sense given it\u2019s the Yale sub. \n\nAs someone who did Stanford undergrad, and was considering Harvard and Yale for PhD programs I ended up NOT being a fan of the Yale quality of life. Stanford is definitely a bubble in that it\u2019s difficult to do things outside of the Stanford/Palo Alto area. Yale felt very similar to me. New Haven is a small town and most everything there is to do there is related to Yale. \n\nUltimately I chose Harvard for my PhD because while the \u2018bubble\u2019 atmosphere is exactly what I was looking for in my undergrad, I wanted to be able to have a life that did not revolve around school as someone in their mid 20s. I cannot stress how important environment is in selecting a school and making sure you end up living in a place you\u2019re excited to be at for the next 4 years",

The weather and school culture were great for me. \n\nI hate Yale and I am counting my days to when I can move out of New Haven. \n\nI use to work at Harvard and I really liked living in Boston. I would not underestimate the fact that you have to live in the place you choose for the next four years (at least). \n\nTbh I would pick Stanford again, but I recommend you visit all of the schools and talk to current students to figure out what would be best for you! All of the programs will be comparable enough at the end of the day.",

    "postText": "Hi. I'm an incoming freshman, and I'm absolutely terrified. I'm literally feeling intense dread and anxiety over the thought of starting school this fall. I don't know what I'm really doing by sharing this here, but I can't exactly share this feeling with friends or family! I'll try to write in a non-identifying manner without sounding insufferable lol.\n\nA few points: \n\n1) I don't *know* anyone yet. I have a few  acquaintances, and I talked to a few people at bulldog days who I liked, but other than that, I've failed to find a distinct friend group. I know that these early cliques often don't last, but just based off of social media, it feels like everyone is already connected and friendly with one another. Did I just miss out on every early opportunity to meet people? \n\n(side note: I struggled socially during my freshman and sophomore years of high school. I am NOT reliving that here.)\n\n I should've joined the discord earlier! Those people are all friends! I should've made plans with people at bulldog days, because literally I just bounced around from event to event alone! I felt WAY out of my element there. The nyc people know everyone already. Everyone *knows* everyone already. I'm  extroverted and social now, but I felt like a total fucking loser at BDD, and I fear that the same thing will occur on campus during orientation week\u2014I'll fail to find a friend group, cliques will form, and I'll be left in the dust. \n\n2) I won't be able to handle the workload.  I got good grades in high school, but does this mean I'll be able to do the same at Yale? I participated in extracurriculars and did well in them, but will I be good enough to participate in Yale extracurriculars at a meaningful level? I'm gradually realizing that I'll be a tiny, TINY fish in a huge, impressive pond, and I'm worried that I'll struggle immensely with the academic and extracurricular pressures of being a student here. \n\n3) I'm lower-middle income, I'm getting a whopping amount of aid, and I don't know ANYONE who went to a non-regional college, but I'm technically not FGLI.  I don't have the social knowledge and financial security of most other non-fgli students, but I also don't have a community to relate to and fall back upon when things get tough. I'm stuck in the middle, I guess. \n\nUgh. I'm just scared.",

            "comment": "An actionable tip: definitely do a pre-orientation program, it'll make it much easier to meet people before the actual start of Yale. \n\nDiscord/GroupMe friendships don't even last a week. Some people are meeting other people on social media and maybe some of those friendships will last longer, but it's not the expectation. \n\nIt's super intimidating that some people do all alread know each other---NYC private school kids are all connected, as are a few other enclaves---but for the most part, a lot of people at Yale are just normal ass kids who did really well at their normal ass public high schools. Focus on being kind to people and asking questions and it won't be difficult to meet people. A lot of people feel just like you do right now. \n\nPS I didn't meet a single person I liked at BDD but I was able to meet tons of really good friends at Yale during my first year. BDD is different (and worse)",

As I opened my portal, I was both elated and terrified as I thought Yale had made a decision ( have a 1320 SAT).  covid semesters made everything worse because I was remote in fall (when freshmen got to meet one another) and got in campus in spring (when sophomores got housing). Yeah things sucked for a while but everyone there is nice and will likely feel the same you are. Also, small interactions go a long way; my current friend group I have because I enjoy breakfast a lot and so do they. I also slowly got into clubs and research and the people in both those areas are so welcoming and friendly. I think you\u2019ll find your group considering you\u2019ll be on campus haha. For grades, i would say it\u2019ll be different than hs for sure but that can change. You have a plethora of resources like peer tutoring (great for friend making) or office hours. And even if that does not work for you you can always reach out to professors to sit down and help you out. I know for me I would not be able to beat DFQ without those sit down sessions. For now enjoy the time at home cause you\u2019ll miss it for sure haha:)",

            "comment": "1) I honestly don't think it's true that everyone is already connected. There are some people at FSY right now which may be what you're seeing but the vast majority of people aren't close friends or anything, mostly just becoming acquainted. When you get on campus, you will have your suite, Camp Yale program, residential college, classes, extracurriculars, parties, and whatever else to connect with people. Please don't feel like your social life at Yale is over before it's even begun. Something I've noticed just by interacting in the Discord is that people here are way more accepting, diverse, and friendly compared to where I'm from.\n\n2) They chose you for a reason. Of around 50,000 applications, they chose a little over 2,000 to admit, and you were one of them. Please think for a second just how crazy that is. If they didn't think you could handle the work or contribute to campus, they could've just picked someone else from that huge pile of 48,000. That wasn't what happened though, they were confident enough in your potential to put you in the 4% who made it.\n\nWhat you're going through is incredibly normal and I relate heavily to pretty much everything here as someone who is also an incoming first-year. I didn't even go to BDD due to other commitments, I'm on a huge amount of aid but barely not full ride (and no Pell grant either), my mom has an Associate's so technically I might not be first-gen depending on who you ask, I'm from a rural Southern state compared to most others who seem to be from Cali or the Northeast, and I went to an average public high school. If you want to connect literally just DM me, I'd be happy to. All I've been doing is talking in the Discord occassionally, doing whatever Yale needs me to do like placement exams or vaccination records, and enjoying the rest of my summer.",

I sometimes feel those same feelings and worries you are describing as well. \n\nYou have to believe in yourself, you did not get into Yale by mistake. Be confident and let Yale be an opportunity for you to improve on/change those aspects of your social life that you aren\u2019t satisfied with. Be yourself. Be open to new experiences, new friendships, and so on. \n\nIn case it helps, I like to remind myself of this quote from Melville in Moby Dick\u2026 \n\n\"...one most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on, for ever and for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.\"\n\nThe point being that journeys are circular and often repetitive. You\u2019ve started and completed journeys before in your life and you will continue to do so in the future. Yale is just the next one for you.  Let your past journeys inform this new one and then, also, enter into this new one with the openness to learn and experience things that will inform your next. That\u2019s pretty much what life is all about. \n\nBest of luck, my friend. Cheers! \ud83c\udf7b",

I regret the nervousness and worry I experienced more frequently when I was your age.\n\nYou\u2019re going to be ok kid! Not just ok, you\u2019re going to have a fantastic experience and meet many incredible people. If the admissions committee chose you, you belong. Don\u2019t worry about the kids who are already wealthy and connected, it doesn\u2019t matter at all. Focus on your own personal development and finding new friends and interests. I\u2019m jealous, I *wish* I could go back and be a college student again. It\u2019s scary to be so unsure and to embark on a huge adventure, but you have to believe you have what it takes.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone or unusual, most freshmen are afraid and don\u2019t know what to expect. You\u2019ll adjust, and someday soon you\u2019ll love it there (I hope). I\u2019m a university instructor at a school with far fewer resources, and all of us in the faculty want nothing more than to help you learn and thrive in every dimension. Yale has a far better ability than my institution to help each student strive toward their potential, including you! I\u2019m excited for you, good luck!!",

Most people will be in the same boat as you when you arrive on campus and will be eager to make new friends. You\u2019ll make friends in your residential college or old campus dorm, your classes, and whatever extracurriculars you get involved with (maybe start looking at onlyconnect for campus orgs if you haven\u2019t yet. Many of my friends are from the clubs I was apart of). While you will likely stay friends with them, eventually people will fall into a friend group but it can take time. My first-year roommate only ended up in my friend group near the end of our sophomore year (he initially hung out with other people). The friend group was still expanding into senior year. Also (and I highly doubt it) if someone thought you were a \u201closer\u201d then a) you wouldn\u2019t want to be friends with them and b)Yale is a medium sized school so there is so many other people you will meet. I like to say it\u2019s small enough that I\u2019ll see someone who I know when walking to class but big enough that I was constantly meeting new people.\n\n2. You will probably be fine or else Yale would have rejected you. If it makes you feel better, you can practice developing good study and work habits.  Also know that if things get tough, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to your Dean and the other resources available or email the prof about an extension. It will be a step up in the amount and difficulty of work but you can handle it. Also, if you are like me, you may feel at some point that you are struggling while everyone else is fine, know that most of them are also hiding the struggle. Also i think there is no shame in taking an easy class a semester to give you more time for the interesting and/or major-related classes.\n\nLastly, imposter syndrome is very much a real thing and I think most Yalies also have it when they first join. Always remember that there are plenty like you at Yale and that you all deserve to be there.",

There isn't some deadline by which everyone will have friend groups made up already. Everyone develops close friends differently, but I'll tell you now there will be opportunities all the way up to graduation. By the same token, of course some people have instantly found groups, but there's no gaurantee those will hold forever, or won't accept new people. I find that you make the most friends in classes and working together, via extracurriculars (also not essential) and friends of your suite mates - note, none of this has occurred for you yet! Talk to any upperclassman about bulldog days to see both how significant it seemed at the time and how insignificant it is in the long run - imo it's one of the most unnatural environments for making friends during your Yale experience. Pre-orientation programs can be great, but go in with an open mind and don't be disappointed if you don't walk away with close friends - it's such a small slice of the entirety of Yale.\n\n2) went to tiny public school where being a big fish in a small pond was nearly trivial. Won't sugar coat it, academically Yale can be hard, especially alongside other time-sucks. But don't fret, because it's hard for everyone! Everyone struggles. My biggest piece of advice is work with others from the get-go, because struggling together is learning and even fun, where alone you can more easily get overwhelmed. Go to office hours (you'll make friends too!), befriend your professors, allocate enough time for yourself to do things healthily (this will take a bit to figure out). Also, it will get easier as you grow through college. You'll have many personal academic crucibles to get through, but you'll look back at them with pride that you did them. Every semester I feared I took on too much, but you find a rhythm and adapt. You got this!\n\n3) you'll find that the FLGI communities are very open and welcoming. Sure, a select few events will have more stringent requirements of participation, but from what you've said about yourself I think you'll fit in. It already sounds like you emphasize with aspects of being FLGI, even if you technically aren't, and that's enough to relate to others stories make friends there. Regardless of your income/finaid, you can ALWAYS talk to ppl in the many FGLI orgs for advice and social support, and there will always be ppl willing to listen.\n\nThe crazy rush of new things at the start of Yale can be overwhelming and anxiety producing if you let it, but try to channel that nervous energy into excitement instead, and be easy on yourself.

    "postText": "Hi! Hope you\u2019re all having a wonderful night (or morning!).\n\nI\u2019m currently a senior in high school looking to apply to Yale. Our school has never sent anyone to Yale, and my counselors don\u2019t really have experience with anything past the few colleges in our area (which is fine, they do so much and I understand that they have to cater to the majority of students!). Because of this, most of my info about Yale either comes from websites or videos, and I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m getting the complete picture of Yale through just these mediums. \n\nIn particular, the Global Affairs major really caught my eye when I was doing research, but I\u2019ve read some Reddit posts from students who have regretted the major or have felt that the Capstone project was a let down in comparison to a traditional thesis. I\u2019ve also heard that some people have found success double majoring in global affairs and econ b/c the requirement overlap, but this was a while ago and I\u2019m not sure if it still holds true today. \n\nI\u2019d love to talk to any student currently studying Global Affairs (or Political Science / Ethics, Politics, and Economics as I\u2019m interested in those too) as I\u2019m curious about the nature of the programs from a first-hand perspective.\n\nThank you so much \u2014 I apologize for impeding on your subreddit but I figured there\u2019s no better place to seek out reliable info about the opportunities at Yale!",

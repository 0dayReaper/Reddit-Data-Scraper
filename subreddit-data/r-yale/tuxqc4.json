    "postText": "I was recently admitted to Yale, and it's one of the main schools that I'm considering. Is it possible to do a bs in Computer Science, and then do an ms in Math or Stats? If so, would I be able to get a TA or RA position that would make it so i get the ms degree with reduced tuition? Thanks!",

You can TA (ULA technically) even as an undergrad, and the pay is decent.\n\nDetails and list of majors here: http://catalog.yale.edu/dus/dus-department/simultaneous-award-bachelors-masters/",

From what I know, the change was so that professors weren\u2019t struggling to get more TAs and a larger room if more people than expected wanted into the class. But basically every class has a cap now, so they aren\u2019t actually accommodating the amount of people who want to take a certain class (I\u2019m currently begging for a spot into a class that I need for grad school). Also shopping period was so fun. I hate that they got rid of it in general\n\nDurfees to BowWow switch: the bow wow isn\u2019t an inherently bad switch, but the food prices have gone up a lot more than the value of our meal swipe, so it\u2019s hard to get a good meal out of a swipe. They also have insane security for it now and the self checkout machines are always breaking (there are no regular checkouts either) \n\nThese are the biggest things I take issue with",

I understand that expense if you're launching yourself into finance, consulting, medicine, or some other professional degree. But I'm a creative. Some people in my field have an MFA, but it really isn't necessary. So I graduated with my BA in the middle of the financial crisis and couldn't beg my way into an unpaid internship. I had to survive by my wits, something I would've had to do with a less impressive degree (or even no degree at all).\n\nAlso, as an old fart, I worry that Yale doesn't have the same intellectual freedom that it did when I was there.\n\nBut Yale definitely formed me in more ways than I can count.",

If you gave me the opportunity to go back in time a year and choose differently, I think I would agonize over it as much as I did last year.  It's a great school but there's a lot wrong with it and my living situation was very difficult.  If I was put in a different suite I think the decision would be easier.",

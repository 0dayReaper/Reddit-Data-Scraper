I stayed there for bulldog days and I hated both the building and the suite that I stayed in (although the students there were awesome.) How much does your residential college (specifically the building and rooms) affect your experience at Yale? Should I try to transfer next year if I still don't like it?",

I have never heard of anybody transferring college because they were that fussed about the location or facilities, only because they wanted to be with friends elsewhere. You mmight be surprised. \n\nAnd generally, your residential college really doesn't change that much about your social life at all. All of my friends have far more friends outside their residential college than within it, especially since a lot of them lived off campus in the last few years.",

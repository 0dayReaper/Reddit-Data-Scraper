[This](https://advising.yalecollege.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Dean%20Chang%20pre-med%20course%20selection%20guide.pdf) is a useful guide. I am no longer pre med but I took Chem 161, Chem Lab I (forgot the nunmver) Math 115, a first year seminar, and social science credit for a total of 4.5. I wasn\u2019t a neuro major but again former premed.",

I missed the memo and thought it was true until I got to the very end and read about you/the author \ud83d\ude05  \n\nThe only other indication I had was the mention of \u201cthe undergraduate green\u201d a couple of times\u2014not really a term that Yalies would use.",

I did not go to Yale undergrad, but did go to the law school years ago. I updated the story recently so the tech/slang is more contemporary.\n\nAppreciate the feedback!",

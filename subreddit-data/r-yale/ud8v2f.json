I was involved in The Yale Record (humor magazine) and The Cucumber (stand-up), and they were some of the most important parts of my college experience. I hear a lot of people now say they wished they tried comedy in college, and the Yale scene for it is really good, varied, and generally quite welcoming to newcomers.\n\nI also saw your other post about extracurrics and I will say I tried doing 4-5 when I was a first-year and totally flamed out. 2 main ones (my other was a club sport) and casual engagement with a 3rd was the right level for me. It's OK to try out lots of stuff to start and then decide what makes you happy. \n\nEdit: Also, Yale has a club for everything, and if it doesn't exist yet it's really easy to make a new club. So pursue what you love!",

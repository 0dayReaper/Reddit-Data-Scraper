Next thing you know you'll be feeling like this at graduation. Emotions are part of the human experience and you'll probably look back on yourself with more kindness in 10 or 20 years. Hang in there, you're not alone.",

And you\u2019re traveling all by yourself across the globe to start an incredible new adventure. Soon you\u2019ll make new friends and have roommates and be busy with classes and the homesickness will ease. Thank goodness for modern technology: Zoom and FaceTime will help you stay connected with family back home! You can do this. Good luck with your orientation trip!",

I faced a somewhat similar situation moving to Yale from California to start grad school.  It takes a while to adjust but once you make the adjustment you'll grow to love your new home. I have been in New Haven since June and love it.",

You have a great future ahead of you, and your family is probably very proud and excited for you. When you get to campus, try to get out and meet people &amp; get involved in clubs or activities early so you will connect with some locals and feel less lonely. Don\u2019t hide in your dorm room - it will make homesickness worse. Good luck!",

            "comment": "Here's a fairly typical first semester schedule you might look at:\n\nFirst-year seminar (doesn't have to be in the Poli Sci department, but could be, I believe you're required to take 2 seminars for the major)\n\nLanguage\n\nPoli Sci intro class (one of PLSC 111, 113, 114, 116, or 118; two of these are required for major)\n\nQR credit (also could do Sc)\n\nThis'll give you 4.5 credits and offer a fairly balanced load while covering your first-year distribution requirements. I'll refrain from giving specific class recs since ideally you would cater this to your interests, and there are others like your FroCo and college dean once you get on campus who will give you more specialized recommendations. I'm not sure what the situation is for co'27, but for '26, we had a discord with a bunch of upperclassmen who gave advice on classes and schedules. \n\nI will say that it's not worth worrying about schedules this early, I believe you only register a few days before classes start. If you really want a head start on specific class recs, go to [CourseTable](https://www.coursetable.com/) (prefrosh might not have access yet, not sure) and look at ratings and reviews for things that interest you. Pick a wide variety, don't expect something finalized since it's very likely to change.",

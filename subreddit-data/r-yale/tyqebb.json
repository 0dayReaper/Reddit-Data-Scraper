    "postText": "Hello, I am an incoming Comp Lit PhD student and I am wondering what the best grad dorm, in the general opinion. I'm not sure whether this subreddit is exclusively for undergrads but I thought I'd try anyway. I value location, somewhere central on campus, but also near the city, and ideally, near a gym.\n\nNever been to New Haven, would appreciate any/all opinions!",

Yale, especially the central campus area where I assume most of your classes/work would be, is fairly small, so don't worry about not being close to what you want.",

Few people stay beyond a year there though. I\u2019ve heard mixed things about Baker Hall, it\u2019s closer but apparently very expensive for what you get.",

If you have a Yale email join the Yale Grad Free &amp; For Sale &amp; Rent Facebook group, where postings for apartments and housemates are made.",

When the hand soap ran out facilities sometimes took a month to refill, even in the kitchen where we handled raw food. The walls were grimy, paint was flaking, the pipes were stained (not sure if it was rust or something else), cracks in the walls and ceilings. The place is just very very old - it just has that dirtiness that comes with decay - and it is not well kept up. Also word of warning - if you live on the third floor it becomes oppressively hot in the summer and for some reason you are not allowed an air conditioner, even your own. I would take a shower before bed and again at 4 am when I couldn\u2019t sleep, and still wake up sweat soaked. Again, a great community but I wouldn\u2019t move back. Edit:Maybe it has changed? I lived there 2018-2019.",

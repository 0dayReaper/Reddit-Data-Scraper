College is supposed to be a time to explore what you want to do with your life, and you can miss that if you are laser focused on doing law school. \n\nI worked in politics between college and law school, and, while I didn't wind up doing it long term, I think it helped me as a lawyer.",

They\u2019re like a gang, and they have no regard for human life or right or wrong. People who have lived in privilege their whole lives and have had their souls corrupted by it. I\u2019ve always wondered how leaders like Hilary Clinton could be so sociopathic and I\u2019ve seen younger versions of these types of people at Yale poli sci. Try Harvard if you can, but if you have to do Yale focus on working with the faculty and keep interactions surface level with any students. Otherwise, it\u2019s like doing a bid in jail. DTA: don\u2019t trust anyone at Yale.",

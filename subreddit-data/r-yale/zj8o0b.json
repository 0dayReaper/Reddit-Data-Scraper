    "postText": "Hello, I am a non-traditional CC student planning on applying to the Eli Whitney Program. I have some general questions, but also hoping for any general advice at all!\n\n\\- Anyone with kids: What are schools like? Family life? Is New Haven a good place to live? What is it like being a Yale student with children?\n\n\\- Does anyone have experience with \"100% of financial needs\" being met? What does that entail?\n\n\\- How does the rigor compare to CC, or just a public university in general?\n\n\\- Do I have to have outstanding achievements to be considered? I am not a veteran, but I am a young mother with a current 4.0 GPA. I also have, what I consider, to be adverse life experiences that are valuable in a non-trad student.\n\n\\- Can anyone share some examples of their short answer questions or personal statements? \n\nAgain, any other advice or wisdom anyone can share would be fantastic.",

            "comment": "Not an Eli-Whitney student but a transfer from a CC and I can speak to the difficulty differential. Yale is significantly harder, probably 2-3x harder on average. You\u2019re not necessarily assigned more work here but the assignments themselves tend to require more thought and effort. Additionally, my experience at CC was that exams (particularly in STEM) were predominately multiple-choice. Here, science exams tend to be exclusively short/long answer and really require you to understand the material at a deep level. \n\nI say this not to be discouraging but just to give you a heads up! It\u2019s not unmanageable at all, it just takes some time to adjust to the new workload. I\u2019d strongly recommend taking around the minimum # of credits your first semester just to ease into the experience.",

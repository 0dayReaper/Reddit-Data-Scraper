            "comment": "Someone from my old high school is applying this year to Yale REA. On paper, he's a very impressive applicant(several national recognition in writing, published book, etc.); but he bullied a few of my friends and body-shamed me(I'm overweight). I've always regretted not speaking up earlier; we spoke to my school administration but there won't be a mark on his transcript. I will be a freshman this year at Yale and I was wondering if I should email admissions about the person's behavior. I have several anonymous anecdotes and recordings of people recounting their negative interactions with the person. Whether or not he is admitted, I think Yale deserves to know the full image. But should I do it, has anyone done it(please PM me; I would appreciate it), and am I a bad person for thinking of doing it?",

Would it be intellectual curiosity, compassions, leadership or loving something niche. anything like that?",

They want to see passion and drive. They want to know your aspirations and how you are going to make a change. When deciding who to admit to Yale, just about everyone they are choosing between would thrive at Yale, so that is one method they use to choose between candidates.",

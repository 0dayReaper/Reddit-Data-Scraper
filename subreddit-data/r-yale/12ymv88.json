    "postText": " I am seriously considering applying for Ph.D. in the art history department but have some questions and concerns.\n\nRegarding Yale's art history department- How is the program? How are the professors? Do you feel supported? Welcomed? I guess for lack of a better term what is the vibe?  Do you feel an atmosphere of comradery amongst peers or is it more competitive? \n\nI  am concerned about a lack of community and wanted to know if a thriving social community exists within the program or on campus. I found I was lacking community and basic inclusiveness during my master's program abroad in Scotland and think it is vital to the college experience in general at least for me. Basically, I felt extremely isolated and I don't want to experience that again.\n\n I have also heard New Haven isn't that safe of a city. How do you feel about the city?  The area surrounding Yale? My friend from New York said he doesn't think it is a safe city which is part of the reason I am asking as it gives me pause. I've lived in Edinburgh, Scotland so I am not unfamiliar with a large city and all that comes with living in a large city. \n\nSo, please any advice or comments on this would be greatly appreciated. \n\nCheers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Apologies if this is against the rules hopefully it isn't)",

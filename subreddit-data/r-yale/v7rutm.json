    "postText": "Kind of a silly question but couldn't find info anywhere else--does anyone know how long the vending machines &amp; fridge outside Bass have been broken for, or if they're just disconnected from service over the summer with Thain being closed? The last few times I've gone to Bass and tried to get a drink or coffee the fridge hasn't taken my card, and the vending machines always show messages saying that they're connecting to the network or need to be restarted. After 5 PM when Blue State etc is closed it's way harder to source caffeine close to the library; wondering whether I should plan to pack stuff for the whole summer \ud83d\ude24",

This is what I find most objectionable. I don't mind the reminder about cultural appropriation, but this link is suggesting cutsey (literally sweets &amp; crayons) costumes instead. They went a step too far by suggesting what to wear. I think Yale students could come up with their own creative ideas and it's super patronising and sanitizing to link to Pinterest.",

The SJW \"I'm offended by everything\"/ Professional Outrage Commitee/ armchair activists. They were big in the student newspapers bitching about something, or holding some event. Again, you can find this at ANY of the top 20 universities. It was already ridiculous when went to school 2006-2010. Now, it's \"blossomed\" into something so bad, it lampoons itself. I'd say it was only 10-20% of the campus, though.\n\n2. The 'normies.' Yes I realize the irony of throwing myself in this camp. These people were concerned about education, making friends, drinking beer, getting laid, learning, loving, figuring out life. We could give two fucks about local politics, an off-color joke someone made, how a party was offensive, Save the Trees, Save the Bees,  save the local radio station, etc. This was 65-75% of the campus. We were mostly spectators of these shit shows.\n\n3. The people who lacked tact/ shock jockies/ racists. The rabble rousers who would either tell poor jokes like Tosh.0 \"Wouldn't it be funny if she got raped?\" \"Smelly Mexicans\" ... and crushing oreos, making racist off-color jokes, frat douchery, etc ... this was about 5% of the student body. Generally ruined shit for the rest of us, antagonized the SJW greatly, stirred up drama, all that shit.",

They are both *discourses.*\n\nA movement presupposes concrete political/social goals, as well as concrete agency (i.e leadership) that pursues said goals. Neither intellectuals nor the PC crowd have *specific* goals. Their goals are so vague and general that they border on *attitudes*. When we *can* identify a specific goal (e.g. the resignation of a university president), it is because this specific goal is seen as conducive to the general goals. By contrast, a social/political movement sets out its goals to begin with (voting rights for women; free elections; desegregation--which, in the context of the civil rights movement was specific in that it challenged *specific* legislation and legal doctrines in the US legal system) and then undertakes (again, specific &amp; programmatic) measures to see these goals effected.\n\nAs for intellectual oppression, \"oppression\" is a hyperbole and I strongly caution you against engaging in hyperbole, as most of what's wrong with the current PC discourse *is* hyperbole (that and rampant logical fallacies born of an uncritical environment). Additionally, anti-intellectualism has a long and entrenched history in the US, and PC discourse, which was largely spawned by intellectual efforts at universities, is even now a relatively insignificant source of anti-intellectualism in this country.",

If they are at a disadvantage, do you think that compensating for that imbalance by lowering and raising the bar for admission depending on ethnicity will eventually result in equality?\n\nI'll tell you my opinion: I think affirmative action of any kind is a short term boon to those individuals it helps, but a long term disservice to the group it claims to help. It serves only to limit the potential of that group by however much is being freely given. ",

                                    "comment": "1.  If affirmative action were to be removed from Yale, minority enrollment would drop.  There is already evidence for this in California with Proposition 209.  African-American and Latino enrollment dropped after it was passed.\n\nThere are also studies that demonstrate that African-Americans and Latinos regardless of class score lower on standardized tests.  If Yale were to have an SAT score cut-off for admission, this would effectively drop enrollment of African-American and Latino students.  It is not entirely clear why this is, one reason could be because of stereotype threat.\n\n2.  Yes, these ethnic groups have historically been put at a disadvantage.  Here is an example:  Many criticize affirmative action because wealthy African-Americans benefit from it.  They argue that this is unfair and that disadvantaged status should be determined by one's socioeconomic class and not the color of one's skin.  This will be unpopular on Reddit, but I am prepared to argue that wealthy African-Americans ARE at a disadvantage in this country.   In America, there are stereotypes that African-Americans are lazy and unintelligent.   There is at least one study that shows that internalizing these stereotypes leads to increased anxiety while taking standardized tests leading to lower scores.  The threat of these stereotypes affect both poor and rich African-Americans.  The majority has the privilege of not having these unfortunate stereotypes about their group.\n\n3.  Yes, lowering the bar for admission will result in equality.  Unless you think that every American student is on a level playing field, measures like affirmative action are unfortunately necessary for now if we want to live in an egalitarian society.  There will hopefully be a day in which affirmative action is no longer necessary.\n\nI think that you are also missing the point (not just you but a large subset of the American public) that affirmative action not only benefits minority students but also majority students by exposing them to different cultures and, therefore, enriching their educational experience.  You may then question why is diversity so important for a top-notch educational experience like you would receive at Yale?  It is because exposure to different groups of people with very different experiences are essential to achieving the university's mission for creating an environment where learning and empathy are fostered.\n\nCan you elaborate on why affirmative action is a long term disservice to the group it claims to help?  \n\n",

I ask because when you start talking about feelings of stress, you start getting into a very subjective realm. I know I was stressed out when I took my SAT. Is the stress from internalizing a stereotype larger than the stress of wanting to get into Yale, for example? Is this specific stressor quantified in heart-rate or some other tangible metric? Have these studies ruled out any other possible causes of lower test scores from African-American and Latino students?\n\nI see your point about diversity, that it can create an environment in which more cultures get exposure and enrich the educational experience of all students. I agree that this has value, but there is a cost for this, and it is the rejection of students with more merit who had no say in their ethnic background. \n\nThe reason I think affirmative action is a long term disservice is because when you lower the bar for someone, the natural response is to just shoot for the lowered bar. If they had to achieve the same level as anyone else, they may fail, but they may also work harder and actually achieve a higher level than they previously thought they could. I think AA is an indirect way to stifle the potential of bright individuals who aren't given the incentive(read:challenge) to reach the same levels as their counterparts from other ethnic groups. \n\nAA also creates a stigma around being a minority group student in an Ivy League school because one can assume that on the average, students from those ethnic groups scored lower on their SATs. I'm not claiming that lower average test scores make them \"lazy and unintelligent\", but if you ask me, AA doesn't serve to break down the stereotypes between ethnic groups, only build them up, which is bad for everyone in the long term.\n",

I think it was majorly pioneered by a researcher named Steele, I forget his first name - I'm sure you can find it and many more articles. One of my majors was psychology and it's not an uncommon idea.\n\nWhether it explains all differences in SAT scores, I don't know. But race is apparently a social construct, not a genetic one, though ... I'm no expert on the matter. If that were true it would stand to reason that the only difference in test scores would be cultural, socioeconomical (but that was controlled for), or environmental.\n\nTo be honest I used to think AA was a bit unfair, but I think it's a matter of degree. Quotas and cash prizes for hiring minorities I think is a bit too far (I've seen that at some places).\n\nHowever at universities ... yes one can say that it's possible systemic disadvantages have created an unequal playing field in terms of \"reaching\" Yale, and thus a boost is needed. Also there would be a benefit to the student body to not have a completely white/ Asian campus.\n\nAND when it comes down to it ... if you are white and Asian and believe your spot was \"taken\" by URMs ... that means you were on the cusp, the bottom end of admissions standards ... on the fence.

See below for a review article by people that know much more than me on this subject.\n\nThis article may be behind a paywall, but I am assuming that you are a Yale student and should be able to access it: http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070137\n\nIt is a comprehensive review article of the \"The Social Psychology of Stigma\" that cites relevant studies to this discussion. \n\n2.  I think it's too simplistic to think that lowering the bar will naturally  cause students to aim for a lowered bar.  I know that was certainly not the case for me as well as my minority colleagues.  That sort of mentality will not help one succeed at a university like Yale, where having an ambitious personality is so important.  I have faith that Yale admissions screens out applicants that do not have this attribute.  \n\nI think we should also consider that a high SAT score in and of itself does not make one the right fit for Yale or entitled to attend Yale.  There is more to an application than GPA and SAT scores, and I am sure that minority applicants are not given a \"pass\" on things like leadership position, extracurriculars, etc.  (Anyone with more knowledge about the admissions process please correct me if I'm wrong)\n\n3.  I do think AA creates a stigma around being a minority student at an Ivy League school.  I think the stigma exists because of ignorance.  If more people like you actually probed deeper on the issue of affirmative action and why certain groups of people are disadvantaged, I am sure this stigma will slowly disappear.\n\nEdit: Deleted \"the\" in first sentence.",

They are very much distanced and distinct from the Yale *central* administration and the Yale Executive Committee, the unit responsible for reprimanding and punishing improper student behavior. In fact, they're even physically distinct - the cultural houses are located in a row on the southwestern edge of campus, and all the main Yale administrative offices are on the opposite northeastern edge. So the first email was basically a message from student groups to their peers, just signed by the adult representatives of each student group, who again have the title of Dean but no actual administrative power.\n\nOne of the main gripes with the second email is that *Erika Christakis* clearly didn't understand that distinction at all - one of the longstanding grievances held by many minorities at Yale is that the cultural houses are perennially underfunded and more or less forgotten about by the central administration. I doubt Erika Christakis could have named all the cultural houses at this university in which she teaches before the whole controversy erupted, which is problematic given her Associate Master position giving her stewardship over students belonging to all of those cultural houses. Students are mad about her email because she thinks there's \"implied administrative control\" in a message coming from the representatives of the cultural houses, when in fact the cultural houses have zero administrative power.",

Do you feel some of those students quoted are also wrong in their interpretation compared to yours? \nBasically I find that there's been a lot of misunderstanding and misquoting of Christakis. This is evidential in how students of Yale have been split and have expressed similar opinions of Christakis:\n\n&gt; Students interviewed were divided on the issue. Anthony Vigil-Martinez \u201918 said that while the email sent by the Intercultural Affairs Council only suggested that students be sensitive in their costume choices, its purpose was still to rid campus of culturally offensive costumes and would limit the opportunities for the campus to discuss the problem at large. By pre-empting these conversations, the **administration only eliminates the visibility of discrimination without ever addressing the causes**, he said.\n\nI would would have to say your view points appear to me to be misrepresenting Christakis (I could be wrong, but from my understanding of this matter from various media outlets and comments from Yale students that's how I feel) and as you are a student of Yale, I'd like to ask you to meet Christakis face to face to ask her directly on the matter and allow her to explain to you her email. Would that be fair of me to ask you of this? ",

I just hope people are mature and educated enough to have frank discussions in a university environment. \n\nSo what exactly does Christakis say, in your opinion, that can be deemed bigoted or disrespectful?

I will be trying to understand your original comment more and be asking for clarity on several points. I would appreciate if you could help me understand more clearly your original post by answering these questions:\n\n&gt;\"Free speech\" and the \"marketplace of ideas\" has been thrown in minorities' faces as a justification for bigotry and disrespect since always.\n\nWho in the article used \"free speech\" or \"market place of ideas\" as justification for bigotry and disrespect? Was it anybody in the article? Can you specify a particular passage?\n\n&gt;This new \"coddling\" narrative from which Christakis has clearly drawn her inspiration is the same nonsense reworded for our time.\n\nWhere do you glean this information from? The article itself by Friedersdorf? Or from Christakis's email? Please can you point to specific passages in either the article or email?\n\n&gt;Friedersdorf suggesting this is some novel argument Christakis has made is just another example of how ignorant he is on race matters. His pontificating reeks of privileged whining.\n\nDo you feel this the correct analysis to make on your quoted passage? Especially in regards to Friedersdorf supposed ignorance on racial issues. After all, he has got a lot of articles in regard to racial matters under his belt and appears like he has done a lot of thought on the matter. Here's some recent ones:\n\n[Trump - The Hispanic Vote](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/08/donald-trump-the-gop-and-the-hispanic-vote/402658/)\n\n[A Conversation About Black Lives Matter and Bernie Sanders](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/08/a-dialogue-about-black-lives-matter-and-bernie-sanders/401960/)\n\n[Thugs and Terrorists Have Attacked Black Churches for Generations](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/thugs-and-terrorists-have-plagued-black-churches-for-generations/396212/)\n\n[The Audacity of Talking About Race With the Ku Klux Klan](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/03/the-audacity-of-talking-about-race-with-the-klu-klux-klan/388733/)\n\n[Blue Reforms and Black Lives](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/blue-reforms-black-lives/412573/)\n\n[A 58-Year-Old Black Man Reflects on the Death Around Him](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/a-58-year-old-black-man-reflects-on-the-death-around-him/410908/)\n\n[A Cleveland Police Officer's Heroic Attempt to Save a Black Life](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/a-cleveland-police-officers-heroic-attempt-to-save-a-black-life/409759/)\n\nAnd crucially (I like to invite you to read this article):\n\n[Police Brutality and 'The Role That Whiteness Plays'](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/05/police-brutality-and-the-role-that-whiteness-plays/393713/)\n\nI won't list them all as I don't have time to read everything he has written.\n\nIn all, I feel that Friedersdorf is quite knowledgeable on race matters in the USA. Far more so than I am at the very least from the body of evidence of his writings. I feel your assertion of his ignorance on race matters to be entirely unfair and I'd like you to retract that criticism of Friedersdorf.\n\n\nI also personally don't feel that his article is one of \"pontification\". Do you feel this sense of pontification that apparent? Do you think a reader like myself should be aware of it? If so, why do you think I am not aware of it?\n\n\nAgain, I am sorry for the long post. But I did mention before I want a frank **discussion** to understand your perspective. I am also sorry for being a little dense for still not fully understanding your view points and asking for further clarification. I sincerely hope you can spend a little bit of time and oblige me.",

I don't mean to demean you, I'm just trying to understand where we stand in relation to one another.\n\nFrom my take on the email, it seems to me that Christakis is as anti-racist as any of the student protesters. And while he is advocating for freer allowances on speech, he is not advocating that racist acts be held unaccountable.\n\nInstead of a top-down ban on racism, this call for student dialogue seems more so an alternative, lateral push against racist behavior. Simply put, I think Christakis and his wife don't see much value in authoritative bans, but instead wish to see students themselves take the initiative to educate on and resist such behavior.\n\nDo you disagree with my reading? (I'm assuming so) I'm interested in hearing on your take, because I really don't think they're throwing anything on minorities faces' or at all whining. They're merely advocating a differing method of resisting racist behavior.",

He wasn't calling for a ban, he wasn't dictating policy, he was just imploring his students to *think* about their costumes. I read Christakis' email first and felt like I was taking crazy pills when I read the dean's email after because he was basically telling students to think just like she was...only difference being he wasn't giving students a wink and a nod to go ahead and dress up in blackface like Christakis was.\n\nAnd yes, the Chistakis' really are pontificating when they make long-winded arguments about how the alienation minorities feel when white kids appropriate their culture for a Halloween costume is worth...whatever the fuck benefit they think is derived. I honestly have no idea what Erika thinks is so worthwhile about it. She's making vague gesticulations at kids thinking for themselves or whatever, but that seems like complete bullshit since if the dean had not said anything most of these kids wouldn't have thought about it at all. How are we teaching kids to think for themselves by keeping them ignorant of the issue? The mind fucking boggles.",

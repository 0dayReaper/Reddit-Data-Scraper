    "postText": "Hi everyone! Do you prefer a Kindle or paperbacks for readings in seminars and other classes? I personally love physical books because of the ability to quickly flip through pages, write on the margins, and have my favorite books atop my table all the time. However, a Kindle does seem practical for college because you don't have a lot of space in your dorm, you can read in the dark when you're working late into the night, and you don't have to carry all those books while traveling as an international.\n\nI'm thinking of getting a Paperwhite 5, so if you use (or have used) a Kindle for reading in college\u2014not textbooks, though\u2014how do you feel about it as opposed to owning physical books? I'm an incoming first-year, by the way.",

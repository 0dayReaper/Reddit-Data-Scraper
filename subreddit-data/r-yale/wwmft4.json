If you skip 201 you will have to take another course focused on programming... which isn't an issue unless you were planning on taking 4/6 theory-based electives",

            "comment": "In terms of programming skill, yes. CS201 is taught in Racket, a language which encourages recursive programming as opposed to iterative programming. The latter is much more commonly used in 223, 323, and 365. CS50 uses C - as do 223 and 323 - and Python, which many other electives are taught in. However, 201 is still a very interesting class in computer *science* (As opposed to computer programming). Most people either love it or hate it, and I happened to love it.",

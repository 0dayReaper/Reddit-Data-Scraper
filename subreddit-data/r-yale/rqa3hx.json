I genuinely thought I was adjusting OK to college-level academics, and I'm a bit worried, though, because I know everybody pretends to be doing better than they actually are, but I'm pretty confident people aren't screwing up this badly.",

First I want to say it yeah it sucks, but there is nothing you can do in retrospect. Secondly, it doesn\u2019t matter as much as you think. At the end of the day, it\u2019s probably not going to be the deciding factor as to why you don\u2019t get a job or get in somewhere. (Especially if you are a first year like your post seems to imply. Employers will give leeway with that) Lastly, yeah there are some nerds who don\u2019t have a life or people only take easy classes who are cruising through Yale only getting As but those people are certainly missing out on parts of Yale. A lot of students have Bs and quite a number have at least a C but are too ashamed to admit it. You only ever hear the people doing well talk about grades so there is a survivorship bias.",

Unless you have very specific plans for very specific grad school etc. and even then, it really doesn\u2019t matter where you go to grad school. \n\nMy buddy graduate from the lowest ranked law school in the country.

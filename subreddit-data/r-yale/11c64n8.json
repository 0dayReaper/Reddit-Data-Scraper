Still, I have religious sensibilities regarding hookup culture and would like to ask how often guys bring girls over to their dorms for that.\n\nI would appreciate any input you can give me. Thanks for your help!",

They just have no game, or seem to just know a lot of people with singles lol\n\nIf you would be seriously against your roommate bringing someone over (if you had a double) I would highly recommend stating so on your housing form.",

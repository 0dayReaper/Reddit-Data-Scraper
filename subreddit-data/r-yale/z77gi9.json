    "postText": "When I heard I got a single in a suite to live in I was happy at first, and everybody told me that's the best thing you could get... But now, since I don't really vibe with the people in my suite, I wish I had a conventional college floor layout instead. My friends from other schools with just an open hallway and rooms seem to make groups of friends on their floor much more easily. I'm sure it's nicer to have a suite if you are great friends with your suitemates, but as of right now it just feels isolating. I've got friends from activities and classes and such, but only seeing them a few times a week and not living in the same building as them just limits how quickly our friendship can progress. Has anybody else had a similar experience?",

I ended up meeting my best friends that way because they were friends with one of my suitemates. The year after I joined a different suite that I clicked more with. My closest friends from my time at Yale were actually people in a different college. I guess my only advice is to try to make friends with people beyond your living space.",

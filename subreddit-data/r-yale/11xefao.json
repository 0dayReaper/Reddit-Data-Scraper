I read the handbook and I'm aware that I have to get referral, but what next?\n\nDo I have to pay in full and claim reimbursements? or I just have to pay copay to the hospital?\n\nI want to know if the costs are automatically covered through insurance.\n\nIt would be too expensive for me to pay in full.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince I'm international so I'm not familiar with this insurance thing..",

You need to be enrolled at least half-time, but otherwise you can access this service regardless of insurance status. You first schedule an intake appointment, then depending on your needs get assigned a psychiatrist and/or psychologist. Yale MHC is at Yale Health and specific to students. If you're not a student and not affiliated with Yale, I'm sure Yale New Haven Hospital (which is open to everyone) probably does have mental health services, but I am not very knowledgeable on that. Feel free to ask more questions.",

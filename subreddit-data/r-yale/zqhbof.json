    "postText": "Hey guys! I was wondering if any Yale students (current or alum) would have time to talk with me about their Yale experience for the Yale supplementals, specifically \u201cWhy Y?\u201d I really believe that the Yale community is second to none and that nearly everyone is A1, high quality. I want to draw on lived Yalie experience but therein lies the obstacle. I\u2019m pretty late to the game and the Yalies ik IRL from family relationships lowkey ghosted me, but I\u2019m chalking it up to their busy schedule and how late I\u2019m reaching out. All that to say, I would LOVE LOVE LOVE to have a current or graduated Yalie to talk with!! I believe there\u2019s a private messaging option but I\u2019m new to Reddit, so is there something I need to do to enable this option? Thanks for all your guys\u2019 help \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c",

I know you are very busy, and it would really mean a lot if we could have a chat. Thank you!\"",

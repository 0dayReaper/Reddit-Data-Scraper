    "postText": "Hello! I'm an incoming freshman who's hoping to have a few questions about their course selection answered :D I've been playing around a little with coursetable since it recently opened for incoming people, and I have a few (albeit detailed) concerns about which courses I should pick.\n\n1. Is there a specific building for korean language classes?\n\n2. Is 15 minutes... a \"reasonable\" amount of time to get to another class? I have these two classes that I'm really hoping to take (one of which being korean^), but I'm not sure if I'm being ballsy trying to get to another class in 15 minutes. Not to mention risking being late but also downtime from attending another class. Though I'm accustomed to only having 5 minutes to prepare before another class from high school, I'm not sure if this changes in college.\n\n3. Is 2 distributional/major credit classes and 2 purely-for-fun classes reasonable for the first semester? Though I am trying my best to pick classes that I know I will enjoy, I know there are some classes that I'll have to take to fulfill credit requirements. Not sure if I should be focusing on fulfilling distributional/major credits this early since I haven't decided on a major yet (looking at... ~5 options + ik I won't decide until at least after freshman year) and distributional credits seem pretty easy to fulfill, but I also don't want to be a frantic junior later trying to graduate with the major I want on time. Any advice on how to approach course selection as a freshman and potentially beyond?\n\n4. Are there any courses that I *must* take in my freshman year? Like, courses that all freshmen should take or highly recommend for freshmen to take? I was trying to search for this but couldn't find the right site(?), so if anyone could potentially lead me in the right direction, I'd greatly appreciate it.",

            "comment": "1. Not sure, I would guess no.\n\n2. Almost certainly yes, unless you\u2019re going from science hill to the art school or vice versa.\n\n3. Certainly reasonable for a first semester, although I would recommend at least one of those two distributional/major credit courses are less \u201cfun,\u201d aka one of the ones you\u2019re less looking forward to taking (aka math as an art major or intro bio as a potential environmental studies major, etc). No need to jump straight to your least favorite area in your first semester, but definitely don\u2019t rush to fulfill strictly the things you\u2019re 100% jazzed about. In general, 1-2 fun classes a semester is reasonable for almost all majors (and it\u2019s a great way to fill distributional credits too!) but I would recommend taking something broad and some general intro class, ideally applicable to multiple majors, your freshman year.\n\n4. No, but I\u2019d you don\u2019t take a first year seminar, you\u2019re missing out. Find one you\u2019re interested in, either this or next semester (or both) and go for it. They are mostly rad, easy, and unique.\n\nGeneral advice: while yale is doing their best to kill shopping period, going and shopping is still quite useful and can get you into things you otherwise wouldn\u2019t. That being said you\u2019re a first year, so you will be at the bottom of most wait lists (excluding first year seminars, which you should try to visit even if you don\u2019t instantly get in if they mean a lot to you, because someone *always* drops). That being said, every subsequent year will be easier and easier for you to get into classes, so do your best to not be discouraged if you don\u2019t get a perfect setup first time!",

            "comment": "1. I have no idea about Korean, but Italian classes are scattered everywhere, so that might extend to Korean.\n\n2. Yeah, it's pretty reasonable most of the time, but if the first class ends up going over routinely it'd become a pain, and can also be a pain if they're across campus from each other (although a bike or scooter can mitigate that problem).\n\n3. Yeah, that's a decent distribution of stuff. If you had a pretty intense major I might recommend 3, but you should be fine (keep in mind that your \"fun\" classes should still fill SC/SS/HU requirements, which is good. If you know you'll probably major in a specific broad area, try looking for fun classes that fall outside of that so you can get those distributionals)\n\n4. Only that you must have 2 classes that are WR, QR, or Language, although definitely try to do a first year seminar.\n\nAlso keep in mind that if a class is say QR and SC it can only count for one of those requirements.",

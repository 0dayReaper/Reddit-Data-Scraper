    "postText": "Everyone enters Yale undeclared for a reason. When you get to campus you are going to be inundated with advisors and mentors who are trained to help you figure this stuff out. It's great to look at course listing and major requirements before coming to Yale, but chances are you are not going to end up in the major you thought you would before you came to campus- most people don't and that's a good thing. Have fun exploring course search, but don't stress about it because you literally have years to figure that out. Same with dual degrees and double majors, which you can declare your junior and senior year.\n\nAlso, you're going to be stressed about your major for four years- why start now?",

Also reposting what I\u2019ve commented on eleventy-seven different \u201cCan I double major in X and Y??\u201d posts)  \n\nLPT: you don\u2019t have to major in something to have a fulfilling educational experience in that topic. You can always take the classes that interest you rather than just to meet the major requirements.  \n\nI promise you, having a paper that says you met two different sets of requirements isn\u2019t nearly as exciting as being a \u201cdouble major\u201d sounds",

More of a symbolic gesture than anyone else, but I think the messaging behind that is important",

If you find that you are no longer vibing with STEM (like I did), it's not much of a loss, you've got your STEM distributional reqs at least mostly out of the way. If you are leaning humanities, you can honestly take a variety of classes that sound fun to you to figure out what exactly you like and might want to commit to. Definitely would suggest getting into a first year seminar at some point too! I don't think your first year course decisions will really affect you down the road, you don't need to stress whether a first year course will look good for post-grad admissions and stuff like that.",

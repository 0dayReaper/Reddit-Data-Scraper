And with the way 2022 has been (see Texas for example), it has only been getting worse. Anti-trans violence is real and disproportionately targets Black, Brown, and Indigenous trans people. This is violence waged on multiple fronts and we need to support trans people in ending it.\n\nNot all speech should be protected as free speech when it harms other people. And even if it is to be considered free speech, we should oppose it on the grounds that it is **wrong**. On Yale campus, trans people are disproportionately vulnerable to so many different violences (sexual, physical, etc.) and microaggressions. Please, choose compassion and human dignity.

                                    "comment": "I know having these conversations can be difficult, trust me \u2014 but this is where we can grow the most.\n\nTo touch briefly on trans violence stats, I linked some sources in my previous comment that pertain to anti-trans violence nationally and anti-trans violence on campus. For instance, the Mariwala and Park YDN article \\[1\\] cite that \"The 2015 AAU Campus Climate Survey \u2014 which interviewed over 6,500 then-students at Yale \u2014 found that over 20 percent of transgender, genderqueer and gender non-conforming students had been victims of nonconsensual penetration, which was higher than the rates for either cis men or cis women... **Nearly 50 percent of transgender people are sexually assaulted at some point in their lifetime**\" (emphasis my own).\n\nAnd as for the \"black on asian hate crimes,\" this isn't based on any empirical evidence and this plays directly into Black criminality stereotypes. I'm Chinese too, so please stop weaponizing the violence against our communities to propagate these ugly tropes. This is anti-Black.\n\nThe cause of anti-Asian hate is white supremacy. One study \\[2\\] based on data from 1992-2014 found that \"perpetrators of hate crimes against Asian-Americans are overwhelmingly white: 74.6 percent of these crimes are committed by white assailants. Importantly, according to the methodology in the study, there is a \\~20-fold difference in the cases of hate crimes reported against African-Americans (5,463) compared to Asian-Americans (329), which explains the large difference in percentage of non-white assailants by race.\" As for data collected during the pandemic, one research team \\[3\\] found that \"**white people accounted for 90% of anti-Asian incidents in 2020, but only 5% of perpetrators were Black**\" (emphasis my own, and also remember here that Black people make up 13% of the US population). White people are overwhelmingly the perpetrators of anti-Asian hate crimes.\n\nWhat you are also leaving out is the fact that **Black people have been most disproportionately harmed and targeted during the pandemic**. For instance, the rampant anti-Black police violence, disparities in COVID-19 illness and death, widening economic disparities, alarming increases in domestic violence against Black women, etc. The list goes on \\[4\\]. You mention anti-Asian hate crimes, but did you know that the majority of hate crimes in 2020 were actually against Black people \\[5\\]? That the largest increase in racially-motivated hate crimes were those against Black people, not against Asians \\[5\\]? Anti-Asian hate crimes have increased significantly, yes, but we must recognize that at the same time, systemic racism and anti-Blackness have hurt Black people the most during the pandemic.\n\nYour comment also erases the rich history of Black-Asian racial solidarity and the vital work that so many Black activists and organizers continue to do in support of Asian communities. In addition to today's protests, looking much further back into history reveals how Frederick Douglass opposed immigration legislation explicitly barring Chinese and Japanese people in 1869, and how Black civil rights leaders like Reverend Jesse Jackson were vital in demanding justice for the racially motivated murder of Vincent Chin in 1982 \\[6\\]. Yes, racial solidarity is complex but as Ms. Lateefah Simon, the founder of racial justice group Akonadi Foundation in Oakland, said of Black-Asian solidarity: \"We don\u2019t know each other in our communities, and we need to do a better job of humanizing each other and not pointing fingers\" \\[7\\].\n\nThere's a lot to be angry about in this world, but this anger absolutely should not be directed towards Black people. The issue you raise with anti-Asian hate (and anti-trans hate) will always be about white supremacy. And with all the violences against Black people, we need to show up in support of Black lives and Black liberation. It seems that these matters are important to you, seeing that you made a whole post and lengthy comment about all this. They are also important to me, too. I am your friend, and I know that you're a wonderful person. There's so much cruelty, and it is hard to choose love and compassion. I struggle with it everyday honestly. But today, know that I care for you &lt;3 We need you.\n\nSources:  \n\\[1\\] [https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2019/10/01/to-name-a-betrayal/](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2019/10/01/to-name-a-betrayal/)  \n\\[2\\] [https://www.newsweek.com/stop-blaming-black-people-anti-asian-hate-opinion-1577887](https://www.newsweek.com/stop-blaming-black-people-anti-asian-hate-opinion-1577887)  \n\\[3\\] [https://www.npr.org/transcripts/980437156](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/980437156)  \n\\[4\\] [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10560-020-00690-4](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10560-020-00690-4)  \n\\[5\\] [https://eji.org/news/fbi-reports-hate-crimes-at-highest-level-in-12-years/](https://eji.org/news/fbi-reports-hate-crimes-at-highest-level-in-12-years/)  \n\\[6\\] [https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/19/opinions/black-asian-american-solidarity-jones/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/19/opinions/black-asian-american-solidarity-jones/index.html)  \n\\[7\\] [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/19/us/black-asian-activists-policing-disagreement.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/19/us/black-asian-activists-policing-disagreement.html)  \n(Minor edits made to spacing and wording)",

It's violently anti-Black and this is unacceptable, **full stop**.\n\nMy comment above never placed blame on you individually as a white man. I'm talking about these much larger systems of oppression and racial subjugation. My question though is *why did you immediately get so defensive*? I was talking about white supremacist structures and not you in particular \u2014 these emotions seem to be signs that your behavior is not aligning with (what I hope are) your values of equality and justice. We all play roles in these various systems of oppression, and as a Chinese person, I am recognizing the work that I must do with regards to racial justice. It isn't your fault individually that this is the world that we were all born into, but we have obligations to do something about it. Looking inside and asking yourself these hard questions are important first steps. Then, let's do something about it together.",

    "postText": "Hi! Can anyone help me figure out what year an older, deceased relative got his MFA from the School of Drama? It was likely in the 1940s. I won\u2019t bore you with the details but this has become important to my family. I\u2019ve tried searching the archives online but it seems like the records are in-person only? Since I don\u2019t live in the area I could use some help! If someone can help me out I\u2019ll privately DM you more details.",

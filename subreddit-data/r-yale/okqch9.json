I was just floored by the descriptions of the national/international projects they'd already participated in and the level of sophistication that they intended to bring to this. I felt hopelessly outclassed and stupid. I really don't think I deserve to be here now.",

Some have to fight against the odds to get in, others have practically been prepared/ have prepared their entire lives for this. Trust the fact that the gatekeepers (admissions) know what they are doing and wouldn\u2019t have selected you if you truly couldn\u2019t handle it. And don\u2019t compare yourself to your peers- each of us are in our own journey, and that\u2019s what matters.",

Then I realized most in the second camp was just taking a particular approach to hide the fact that they too had insecurities. Nothing wrong with how they went about doing it, but nothing wrong with just feeling uncertain about your place, either. Put in the work, explore what you love, and you can get just as much out of college as peers with an elaborate 30-year roadmap to a Nobel prize.",

The sample size that you've interacted with is way too small to draw any meaningful conclusions about your ~1600 other classmates. Not everyone won 1st place at ________ or _______. Suffice it to say that if Yale accepted you as a student, the chances are good that you will be able to handle the academic rigors of the institution, so take a deep breath (4 seconds in through the nose, 8 seconds out through your pursed lips) and believe in yourself.",

The most egregious example: I offered to buy an annotated used language textbook from a classmate who took that class before me, but she refused because she apparently didn\u2019t want to give away her semester\u2019s worth of sweat and blood so easily. The most hypocritical thing about the incident was that she already had a good command of the language and intentionally took an easy class for an easy A.\n\nI wish this were an exception that proved the rule, but this is one of many experiences that led me to realize this was a cutthroat environment after all. On the whole, there were more people willing to help but also many who weren\u2019t or at least wanted something in return.",

The groups I spent the most time with had quite a few cutthroat characters and that may have been something of an aberration compared to the general Yale College population, but they were definitely not complete outliers. The example I gave above was by far the most flabbergasting, but more subtle acts like having \"secret\" study sessions (this from folks who invited you to all their paid social events) or lying about skipping a class to avoid sharing notes were a bit more commonplace (the latter example is not my direct experience, though).\n\nTo be fair, though, most of us were kids who rose above competitions by just about every metric to make it to an extremely selective school, but we were still kids. Looking back, we needed those awkward years to iron out the overly competitive \"Genghis Khan\" streaks that would only prove counterproductive in real-life settings...unless you were an heir of an autocrat.",

I find it hard to believe that you're actually reflecting transparently on your, what, 10 years? at the institution.\n\nIt's never explicit and pointed, but in my experience always so blatantly on the mind of everyone in most contexts. My entire experience there was colored by the attitudes of peers like u/elkresurgence described.\n\nedit- Sry, I don't mean to come at you, and obviously your subjective experience is valid in and of itself, but don't you think the choice of words no \"*real* competition\" speaks as to the different perceptions of very real stressors and social/academic dynamics that exist on and off campus? \n\nI just ask this because I feel like the people and interactions that made my experience feel much worse than it needed to be were *not* surrounding people who were cutthroat and blatantly competitive (what I imagine you refer to when you say 'real competition'). \n\nRather it was those who would do anything to come out 'on top' and shape their whole persona and interactions with others around their own goals. It's not a bad thing objectively, people go here to succeed, we get it... but when people's entire social existence is shaped around figuring out whether they 'even have the time or energy to be friends with X', it's a different story. \n\nPeople like this never see themselves (or others in some cases) as competitive, demeaning, and demoralizing to those around them -- they're too busy thinking about themselves, scheduling social get-togethers that only involve time where you can sit next to them as they continue to ignore everything except their personal studies and goals. It's like, someone could tell their entire life story to people like this, and no matter how wild how tragic how happy how interesting how whatever, these ppl just nod their heads and then continue along thinking about themselves. Hell, I felt like I was lucky if I spoke for more than 20 seconds without the other person just turning around without saying anything and leaving to go study. Not saying you are one of those people, lol how would I know, but I don't even know how it's possible that you didn't notice competition in 10 years there.",

It was very cooperative.\n\nI don't know whether people here care about grad school, but that was very cooperative as well - everyone is always interested in learning more, everyone was very generous with their time, and multiple people voluntarily added me as an author on papers where I was really a glorified technician at best.\n\nIt's interesting to hear your experience because the most I had heard about competition at Yale were vague rumors that pre-meds could be competitive. But the responses in this thread are the first concrete reports I've heard of competitive behavior - I never heard anything like this from my friends.\n\nedit: just read your edit, it sounds like your experience was quite different than mine. There were maybe a couple people I can think of that could have fit your \"what's in it for me?\" description, but most people I came across seemed very genuinely interested in meeting people and learning about them, not for the sake of \"networking\" but because they honestly wanted to broaden their perspective. So I can't really relate very well to what you're saying, but that's what makes it interesting to hear, and as you say \"your subjective experience is valid in and of itself\".",

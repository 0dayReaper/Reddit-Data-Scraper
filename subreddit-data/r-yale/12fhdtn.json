    "postText": "Hi all! I\u2019m an incoming international PhD student looking for an apartment. I\u2019ll be in New Haven in mid-August.\n\nThe thing is, I won\u2019t be able to see apartments myself before that, but everyone is telling me that I definitely should see them before signing the lease. Some realtors and landlords are offering virtual tours and say that I can sign the lease virtually, which I uncomfortable with. But I\u2019m worried that by the time I\u2019m in New Haven, there won\u2019t be many good choices any more.\n\nWhat should I do? Thanks!",

New Haven has an occupancy rate higher than NYC, and so good stuff goes fast. \n\nIf you need a reputable landlord, Elm Campus Partners is the landlord that rents out Yale's off campus housing and is generally way better than landlords like Pike, Farnam and the like.",

    "postText": "Does Yale have a strong physics department? That\u2019s literally my question, and I don\u2019t really care much for rankings (Yale is ranked #11, so very strong) and am mainly asking for how good is it for students. How comparable is it to MIT or Caltech? How demanding are the classes? Questions of that nature.\n Thanks in advance to those who respond",

            "comment": "Yale is one of the top programs in the country and the world, while MIT is often considered THE top program in the world.\n\nHowever, that's at the margin and probably more due to the size of the 2 programs - where MIT is an order of magnitude larger, and graduates that Many more students with physics degrees than Yale.\n\nWhich is also maybe how you should decide where you want to go. A bigger program may not be for you.\n\nEspecially at an undergraduate level where you will be challenged by either and both program's math and physics courses.\n\nWhen I was making that decision, several decades ago at this point, after visiting both programs, I chose Yale for its liberal arts, as I wasn't all in on where in STEM I wanted to be; and ended up doubling in math and economics, rather than physics (as collider funding was waning)  while a friend of mine *lived* for physics and went to MIT.... And we both ended up on Wall Street, fwiw",

I can think of good reasons why either of these would appeal over the other.",

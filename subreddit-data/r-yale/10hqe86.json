    "postText": "Hi everyone, prospective grad student here. I\u2019m considering going for an MPH or masters in biostatistics (MA or MS, idk yet) and I\u2019m neurodivergent (autism, etc.). \n\nIn your experiences, have you found Yale to be inclusive &amp; accommodating of neurodivergent students? Do many professors implement universal design? Have any of them even heard of universal design? Are the students accepting? How\u2019s the disability services office? TIA\n\n(Neurodivergent means learning, psychological, emotional, and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, ADHD, OCD, dyslexia, dyscalculia, Tourette\u2019s, etc. Universal design is a model for architecture, education, etc. where disability accommodations are built in so it\u2019s inclusive of everyone, no changes needed.)",

            "comment": "It exceeds the low bar set by American higher education but is nowhere near as good as universal design. Neurodivergent students often have to enlist the help of the Office of Disability Resources to advocate on their behalf \u2014 but the ODR is affirming and competent, so there\u2019s that.",

            "comment": "There has been recent developments on this front. I was one of few grad and professional student representatives to the provost advisory committee for Accessibility Resources (formerly the committee for students and staff with disabilities which I preferred but that's neither here nor there).\n\n2 years ago a neurodivergence subcommittee was added, headed by a neurodivergent community member, whose first task was about figuring out which resources were lacking for neurodivergent folk. I was on the tech subcommittee and we actually did a lot of work about software and such, but also surveyed folk. Something like 60% of yale college students qualify and use at least once some accessibility measure through the dedicated office. But grad and professional students, despite having roughly the same number of qualifying students don't utilize the center, which is a shame because they could! But grad school and prof schools often feel just a beat out of touch with the main yale college stuff.\n\nSo there has been some renewed and particularized attention to it, but it is very much you need to go access the resources--the faculty themselves won't proactively offer them. But they also are used to folk using them so it wo t be weird for them.\n\nI've had to record a few things, for instance, because my hands are on the fritz often. Many faculty don't like this, but are more than happy to follow the recommended accommodation and they trust me not to do anything untowards.",

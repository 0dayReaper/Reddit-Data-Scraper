I intend to major in MCDB and am likely going to be pre-med as well (mayyyybe double major in EP&amp;E?).\n\nAny advice regarding what I should do this summer to prepare + how to approach my freshman year, both for the lead up to MCDB and Yale in general, would be greatly appreciated :)",

            "comment": "hey! im a current first-year, planning to major in mcdb and also premed! i dont think theres anything you have to necessarily prepare for tbh! \n\ni didnt do much the summer before my first year, but if you don't feel prepared in math i highly recommend applying to ONEXYS if you've received information about it (i think you will get an email if you're eligible but if you really really wanna do it email prof john hall). some people also do summer research as high schoolers, but thats not terribly necessary to prepare for the major itself. \n\nif youre an underrepresented minority in stem, i highly highly recommend applying to STARS I! There will be more information coming especially during bulldog days (insider info: the stars coordinator is planning some kind of event on old campus)! in brief, this program helps encourage fgli and urm kids to continue with stem, and you are placed in an advising group with a peer mentor (stem upperclassmen). in addition, if you get into STARS I then you can also apply for an extended class, Perspectives in Biological Research, which basically helps newer students to stem understand scientific literature and helps you get into research. \n\nALSO!! the [SCQR website](https://science.yalecollege.yale.edu) has a lottt of student resources for stem people! maybe not so relevant right noww, but dean chang's guide for premeds will help you plan out your schedule and what classes you will want to take!\n\nsorry this is so long LMAO but in terms of approaching the first year, most ppl will give u the same advice! DO NOT be a try hard LMAO. yale classes are definitely very hard, even intro classes, and you dont want to overload yourself and burnout very quickly. in the pre med guide i mentioned above, it is strongly recommended to avoid taking both chem + bio your first year (tho some ppl do it anyways LOL).\n\nif you have any more questions, i would be happy to answer them!!",

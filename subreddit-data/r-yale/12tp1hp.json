    "postText": "I'm a '27 admit wondering about mental health at Yale, specifically if Yale exacerbates your preexisting poor mental health. I suspect I have at least some mild form of depression (evidenced by a self-harming habit) and I want to know if it's just significantly harder to deal w/ college in such a high-pressure environment. I've also heard that in years prior Yale MHC will report you for self harm and you'll be forced to take a medical withdrawal, is this still true now? Would you recommend seeking treatment (e.g. therapists, psychiatrists) in the New Haven area or just not mentioning self harm (even if it's not life-threatening) to Yale counselors while still seeking treatment from MHC?",

            "comment": "Hey, current Yalie here - highly recommend getting registered with YMHC as soon as you arrive on campus, since it can take a few weeks to be matched with a therapist.  Yale makes some folks' mental health better and others' much worse; everyone is different and unfortunately you won't know till you get here.  The best thing you can do is be proactive so you've got support already in place if things do get worse.  YMCH and YC3 are both great (and they won't tell you this - but you can get services from both at the same time!)",

However, from what I understand YC3 is stretched fairly thin, and I have also heard it\u2019s basically the same at every university. This semester I\u2019ve read op-Ed\u2019s from princetons newspaper and the crimson on shitty access, so I think it\u2019s non-unique. Though I\u2019d definitely do your own research.",

I was in the same boat when I matriculated and though it hasn't been easy, I'm so grateful to be here and grateful for the support I've gotten at this school - I appreciate how open my peers are about their own struggles and how it's becoming increasingly normalized to reach out for help.  I'd encourage anyone in this position to be proactive about getting a support system in place, but the bottom line is, you can absolutely be successful here while managing depression or any other mental illness.",

As an extreme example, someone coming from a community without supportive family/friend group/teachers/etc is very likely better off at Yale than delaying a year.\n\nIf OP is otherwise excited about the opportunities at Yale, matriculating on time could be an excellent way to grow and heal -- I don't think its fair to characterize attending Yale with mental illness as not taking advantage of the opportunity.",

I wouldn\u2019t view a 4 year opportunity to go to one of the top schools in the world as a cushion which you should use to treat mental illness. You don\u2019t need to live at home during a gap year. Work a bit, save up some money and do whatever you want. I know countless people who lived abroad nannying in Italian villages for free room and board.",

But even taking that first step helped me recognize what helped/what didn't, that my issues were treatable or at least manageable, and I think put me on the path to now *finally* (a decade and four therapists later) knowing what it felt like to NOT be in the mental pit I'd been in for over 9 years -- and now I am considering training as a therapist myself! I think seeking help (from professionals, trained peers/mentors) is better than not seeking help, especially if SH is involved.\n\nOne thing is guaranteed - you will NOT at all be alone in having MH struggles at Yale. I think a place like that selects for, and can exacerbate, depressive and anxious tendencies at the very least. Sounds like you have good self-awareness and a good head on your shoulders - find and keep some good kind friends, and keep talking to others about it.",

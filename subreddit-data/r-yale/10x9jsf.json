    "postText": "So here's the text:\n\n\"you have been named a Yale Engineering and Science Scholar. This means that our office will fund your travel to campus for Bulldog Days and special YES programming, April 23-26. In addition to all of the exciting Bulldog Days events, you\u2019ll have access to a few special events specifically for YES Scholars, including a dinner with faculty members, an exclusive event with professor &amp; Nobel Laureate Jim Rothman, the chance to hear about research opportunities from current Yale students, and more!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat does this even mean? What is a YES scholar? She also said I would be able to conduct research for free both summers I'm there. Is this true? Is anyone else here a YES scholar?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nfor context: i live in oklahoma and just got this message from my AO who admitted me early through a likely letter.",

            "comment": "Former 'YES scholar' here and Class of 2022. First of all, it means you're accepted into Yale (congrats!) It also means that you're a very competitive STEM student that Yale really wants to admit (instead of Harvard, MIT, Stanford, etc). Thus, you get invited to a STEM focused admitted student event exclusive to only YES scholar. Once you matriculate, there aren't really any extra privileges once you start classes though. \n\nDm me if you want more info",

Back in my day, there was a separate weekend in ~February for just the ~100 YES students. Tbh I\u2019m glad they rolled it in with Bulldog Days\u2014I didn\u2019t feel like I *needed* to come back for BDD (live on west coast) but later had FOMO for missing BDD.  \n\nHopefully they\u2019ll put you in contact with a current student soon and you\u2019ll have a chance to ask allllll your questions\u2014and it\u2019s a great resource for understanding more about Yale\u2019s culture and day-to-day life.  \n\nI ended up falling in love with Yale during YES-Weekend. I ended up picking it over all my other choices (Harvard, Stanford, MIT, etc).  \n\nGosh, typing this all out is really bringing back the memories. Enjoy this! You got into Yale!!!!",

                            "comment": "Not OP, but something I think is worth mentioning is that undergraduate subject rankings are generally overrated by high school students / the A2C crowd. Actual outcomes between HYPSM students at different schools are more or less indistinguishable regardless of major -- all of these schools frankly have too much prestige and money to throw at students for outcomes to not be excellent across the board.\n\nThe real thing that differentiates MIT as a prospective stem major is ultimately that 95%+ of your fellow students will be stem nerds. At Yale (and Harvard, Stanford, etc), a large percentage of your peers will be passionate about the humanities or non-stem subjects instead. People differ in which of these environments they prefer; getting a sense of where you personally fall should be a priority during your visit days.",

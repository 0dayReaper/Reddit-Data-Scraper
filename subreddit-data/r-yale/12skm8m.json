    "postText": "So my family and I are moving to New Haven for a master\u2019s program in the summer and I\u2019ve been looking into setting up health insurance coverage for our stay. Yale\u2019s policy would work, but at over $17,000 / year for a spouse and child it\u2019s a bit steep. I was wondering if there are any graduate students with families out there that used alternative methods to acquire coverage. Any thoughts? Thanks!",

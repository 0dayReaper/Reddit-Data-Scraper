                    "comment": "This is not true. New Haven is a city and therefore there are reasonable precautions that must be taken when walking around at night. However, it is a relatively safe city and no one should be scared or intimidated to venture off campus. I walk all over the city alone at all times of the night and early morning, sometimes drunk or on drugs, and have been doing so since I was a teenager. The overwhelming majority of people in this city are respectful and kind and pose absolutely no threat to you. If you keep to yourself, treat others with respect, and stay aware of your surroundings you will have few to no issues.\n\nOP, if I may rant for a second, I absolutely HATE that this question is so popular on this sub. Yale owes so much to New Haven and the community, and venturing out into the city will 100% improve your college experience. There is so much to explore and learn from here. The YPD and some members of the Yale community have done a great job convincing students that New Haven is a dangerous hellhole that they should stay out of. But this idea comes from biases and prejudices against poor people and people of color. And if you are afraid to share spaces with these people, you should have no place at an institution like Yale. Especially since Yale takes so much from New Haven and gives back the bare minimum, and is directly responsible for a not insignificant amount of the poverty and issues that the city faces.\n\nInstead of asking \"is New Haven safe?\" ask yourself what you can contribute to and learn from this community, as a student attending an institution with such wealth and prestige.",

I just think it's wrong to paint New Haven as a safe city -- like that's the virtuous point of view -- simply because Yale students aren't facing the brunt of gun violence in the city. I think \"poor people and people of color\" deserve the same basic definition of safety as anyone else, and 20 murders a year in a city this size sure isn't safe.",

Plus New Haven is much smaller than other cities with similar crime rates. \n\nI was driving downtown with my partner recently, and completely unprovoked a bunch of teenagers approached our car and started kicking it and throwing middle fingers... not sure if they mistook us for someone else, but that never happened anywhere else I've lived. Plus I live in East Rock now, and two months ago there was shooting outside our house on Lawrence/Orange St. in the middle of the day. \n\nI am glad that y'all like it enough here to excuse the ridiculous amount of violent crime (this is not to mention all the petty theft/robbery), but OP was asking if it can be dangerous. The answer is yes, and you won't get that at Harvard or Columbia which are Ivy schools in larger cities.",

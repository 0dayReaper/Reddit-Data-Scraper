    "postText": "Hey, \n\nI am a Canadian high school student and a little confused on how admissions in the US work. I am interested in the EEB program at Yale (and other collages) and was wondering how the application actually works. In Ontario at least, you apply to a specific program. Eg, I would apply directly to a Life Sciences undergraduate program and the prereqs would be G12 Eng, G12 Chem, G12 Bio so on and so on. However, from what I have gleaned from the website, the US does not work like this? It seems to me that an application is submitted, and if they admit you, you get to declare a major or something? I'm wondering what courses they use to make a admission decision and whatnot.\n\nThanks for helping your friend up North!",

            "comment": "Hi, EEB grad here. You don\u2019t apply to any program or major af Yale, you apply to get into Yale and then you declare your major as late as sophomore year. You could mention the majors you\u2019re interested in, but it\u2019s fully nonbinding (you could switch into something like history as late as junior year, but science majors need a bit more prep) That gives you space to take a broader array of classes, but if you have a strong preference for bio it\u2019s not a bad idea to hit the ground running and just start taking a lot of relevant classes immediately.",

It is nonbinding, and nominally doesn\u2019t have an effect on your odds, but likely is slightly higher.\n\nIf you apply to a single choice early action schools you cannot apply to any other school early (aka no early action, no early decision). Unlike early decision, which other schools have, SCEA does not require you to attend the school, and simply gets you a faster response on your application (and shows commitment). \n\nUnfortunately, I do not know how it interacts with Canadian schools, or if they have a similar early admission setup over there. I would advise it if Yale is your number one choice and if you have your application ready in time.",

You don\u2019t need 10 months to do an application if I\u2019m reading your timing right. Starting your essay like in the march the year of your submission is probably good, although it\u2019s probably not the worst idea to brainstorm before then.",

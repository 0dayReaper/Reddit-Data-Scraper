Had a lot of friends in Chemistry I think the culture you\u2019re thinking of is fading with each new cohort, maybe some old school profs try to perpetuate it but most students know who they are and stop rotating with them. Yale is pretty good at taking care of their students. Maybe a place like Scripps or a Boston/Cambridge school that will remained unnamed still have brutal chemistry departments.\n\nEdit- congrats on getting in! Hooray!\n\n![gif](giphy|izOQECJfXMxgc)",

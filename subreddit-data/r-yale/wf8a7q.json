    "postText": "Hi! I'm a rising freshman and just started looking at possible courses to take first semester. At the moment, I'm thinking MATH 120 (multi), ECON 115 (intro micro), PLSC 116 (intro polisci), and either ENGL 114 or 120.\n\nA few questions:\n\n1. How manageable would this coursework be for the first semester of college? For some background, I do have econ experience and a bit in multi as well.\n2. How was your experience in either ENGL 114 or 120 and which one would you recommend taking?\n3. If I'm just trying to get a taste for college polisci (not necessarily major in it), would it be the best option for exploring? If not, what other polisci course would you recommend?\n4. How likely am I to get these courses? I heard that it's pretty common for students to not to get what they sign up for.\n\nAny advice/insight would be really appreciated. Thank you!",

            "comment": "To answer your questions in order:\n\n1. This seems like a very typical and manageable first-year courseload. I can\u2019t say how it\u2019ll compare to your high school courseload, necessarily, but it\u2019s pretty average for a Yale first-year.\n\n2. I took ENGL 120 (though not 114 so I can\u2019t speak to that) and it was definitely a good class. In your previous English classes, if you generally prefer reading over writing, take 120. If you generally prefer writing over reading, take 114.\n\n3. I haven\u2019t taken any poly sci classes so I can\u2019t speak to this one.\n\n4. You\u2019re highly likely if not guaranteed to get into all of these classes. All of them are geared towards first-years and have many sections each.",

A lot of them have Distributional requirements you'll need and it's a great way to meet other first years! \n\nOne of them could probably replace one of the courses you have listed, depending on your major. \n\nYou don't have to repeat your HS schedule in college, let yourself explore!",

Echoing everyone else\u2019s suggestion to take a first-year seminar\u2014they are some of the more unique classes at Yale, and you only get this year to take them. You\u2019ll also make nice friends in first-year seminars, which is harder to do in bigger lecture classes like ECON 115. I also recommend finding a more niche humanities class than the intro English classes. What is something weird that you\u2019ve always wanted to study but weren\u2019t able to in high school? Mine was Ancient Greek, so I took it on a whim and now I\u2019m a classics major lol. Get adventurous! You\u2019re at Yale now, and there are only so many classes you\u2019ll get to take.",

I took 111 (international relations) and 118 (more modern political philosophy). I think typically American Politics and Ancient Political Philosophy are offered in fall, too. My favorite classes so far have been IR and comparative politics classes, so 116 sounds good. \n\nIf you are 100% sure you\u2019re not majoring in political science, it might be fun to take a more specialized class. Any of the first year seminars sound good if you can get in. Personally, I would aim for 030.",

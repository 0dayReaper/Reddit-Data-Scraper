You get an absolutely lovely foundation in the Western canon, and follow a clear lineage of thinkers and writers' influence on one another. (I love, for instance, the one-up-manship that goes on with the proems from Homer to Virgil to Dante to Milton.)\n\nI actually did a [huge write-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/6d3tdx/directed_studies/di06tx9/) on DS last year if you'd like to look at it. (Obviously, skip the bits related to prospective STEM major.) Let me know if you have any specific questions or concerns\u2014now and later!",

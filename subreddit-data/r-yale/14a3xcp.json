    "postText": "Someone from my old high school is applying this year to Yale REA. On paper, he's a very impressive applicant(several national recognition in writing, published book, etc.); but he bullied a few of my friends and body-shamed me(I'm overweight). I've always regretted not speaking up earlier; we spoke to my school administration but there won't be a mark on his transcript. I will be a freshman this year at Yale and I was wondering if I should email admissions about the person's behavior. I have several anonymous anecdotes and recordings of people recounting their negative interactions with the person. Whether or not he is admitted, I think Yale deserves to know the full image. But should I do it, has anyone done it(please PM me; I would appreciate it), and am I a bad person for thinking of doing it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Posted in admissions megathread as well but idk how admissions-related this is",

Not saying that they\u2019d have a good claim, but it is a legitimate risk if they ever found out. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a bully or body shamer, but if someone accused me of that and ruined my shot at getting into a great school I\u2019d definitely be fuming\u2026",

Is putting your own admission at risk worth whatever outcome you're hoping for? I'd argue it isn't (and I think in 10 years you'll feel very silly for even thinking of doing this) but if you proceed with contacting admissions then keep that risk in mind so you won't be shocked later on. There is no way they'd act on an anonymous report of this nature.",

I feel like I sense a kind of bubbling envy? under the surface of all this. That being said, the time to do something is when it happens\u2026. See something, say/ do something. Having yourself graduated and said nothing while you were a HS student, now calling the HS only after rumors spread of their application to Yale, to then moving to try to contact the admissions office\u2026 It doesn\u2019t make sense. I\u2019m not saying you mean ill or have malicious intent, it could very well be the case that you don\u2019t recognize why you feel this way, or how this looks / how it reflects on you. I\u2019d caution that contacting admissions over this ordeal would not look the best for you. Try speaking to a therapist first and getting to the bottom of how you truly feel.",

I'm debating this because I wanted to take action before, didn't, and I heard about more people getting hurt/bullied by this person. I don't want the same thing to happen again at Yale.\n\nPart of the reason for this post is because I've always felt guilty for not speaking up earlier and letting this person get away with hurting others. I have been and will continue speaking to a therapist, but I would really appreciate concrete advice instead of being called a dick.",

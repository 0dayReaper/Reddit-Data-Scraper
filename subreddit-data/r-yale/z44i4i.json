    "postText": " Hi, I am a current undergraduate junior. I came in as pre-med, partly due to pressure from my parents in the medical field. I recently decided to switch my major to economics as I was utterly miserable and ultimately decided medicine and STEM were not for me. I have been trying to figure out where to proceed with career prospects and what industries to look into. My main priority is going into a very lucrative career, as making a substantial amount of money is my first goal (my parents are immigrants, lol). Most of my classmates who are not pre-law or pre-med move into consulting or finance paths because of its seemingly guaranteed financial security. I feel like there would be a missed opportunity not to use my Yale connection in finance and climb the corporate ladder because this is the most straightforward and safest path to financial security (IMO). My first step would be committing to this path and entering investment banking (or other entry-level finance positions). However, I am not sure I would last in these industries. The lack of work-life balance and stimulating content makes me believe I would burn out fast. Further, many of my peer's parents who work in finance seem slightly miserable and have advised me to follow my passions and try as many different positions as possible in my 20s to find something I genuinely enjoy. However, I don't know what I am truly passionate about in a professional setting yet. \n\nDoes anyone recommend lucrative, stimulating career paths I can look into in finance or elsewhere? Any Yale resources I can use to explore other careers? I am a very passionate person and believe if I find an industry I love, I will work hard and succeed. Background about me - I am a very creative person; with a high interest in film, media, and fashion. If I could find jobs in finance or other industries that could incorporate these interests of mine, maybe I could enjoy the seemingly \u2018soulless\u2019 work. I am lost overall, and I know time is ticking with recruiting and interview cycles for many jobs. I understand most finance internships are closed for this upcoming summer, so I am thinking of finding an internship in tech (?) and applying to full-time positions for after school next summer. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! (P.S. I know I might be looking at these industries from a one-dimensional perspective. Please excuse this; I am just now starting to familiarize myself with the corporate world)",

I can't wait to see what the next four years may bring. \n\nCongratulations again, Boola Boola \ud83d\udc99\n\n(p. s. there's already a discord server for the Yale Class of 2027 set up by current Yalies and the Questbridge admits,\n\nhere's the link: https://discord.gg/RUNZ4WCYys , feel free to join!)",

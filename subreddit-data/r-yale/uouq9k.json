            "comment": "I've been involved in some alumni things for FYS. I think the other thread laid out a lot of the specifics and positive well. I don't think I would have personally done it as an undergrad - I have complicated feelings around identifying yourself around being first gen. \n\nThe program has been historically aimed to support students that identify as FGLI. In general, folks tend to make fast friends with the first people the meet on campus and I'm glad that mine was a wider field of students. That said, I also acknowledge that I'm pretty weird - I grew up in deep south texas and so had a different orientation around race, class, and identity.\n\nThe program has been well built to support student's transition to Yale, so I think the question is whether you feel like you want that support (I also personally wwould not want to waste a credit on ENG 114, but that's a different convo).",

I took 116 and regretted it.\n\nAs an example, I really got my writing boot camp in a religious studies class about pluralism and philosophy. \n\nThat said, it also depends on your credit philosophy. I was a second semester senior who took six credits because I wanted every second's worth. \n\nEdit: Actually, lol, this whole time (it's been 16 years since freshmen year) I thought there was a maximum credit number. So as long as you aren't aiming for just 36, there's no tradeoff there. I will admit, part of my comment was forgetting that these classes wouldnt count against the recommended first semester total.",

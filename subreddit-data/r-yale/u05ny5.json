    "postText": "\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc2bHey guys\n\nI have been working on this app for a while and I am really excited to share it with you. It's a college marketplace restricted to students. You can buy, or sell anything you want to other students, ranging from dorm supplies, textbooks, apparel, and ride-sharing, to subleasing or finding off-campus housing for next year ... The app is free, a lot of hard work went into it so make sure you check it out if you need anything for the upcoming semesters! You can only log in using your yale.edu school email!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLink to the app on the website: [https://collegesouk.com/](https://collegesouk.com/)\n\nFollow on Instagram: [https://www.instagram.com/collegesouk/](https://www.instagram.com/collegesouk/) and tell your friends!\n\nLastly, please go ahead and post something it would help a lot to get the ball rolling :) \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc2b hope it helps (upvote for visibility)!",

Nobody wants to download an app, which likely doesn\u2019t have enough activity in its network yet to be particularly useful immediately. \nWe\u2019ve all gone through that process before, and are especially averse to repeating it, only to receive more junk mail.",

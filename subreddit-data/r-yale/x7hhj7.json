    "postText": "I play the piano and was looking to apply to colleges where I can continue studying and learning more about my instrument. However, I would not be interested in a double degree in music. \n\nIn my case, how will I be able to continue studying piano? Will I be assigned a professor for private classes or would I have to do something else?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "\\- If you are very good (i.e., good enough to have entered conservatory), you can audition into piano lessons with YSM faculty, which count for course credit and are free. \n\n\\- If you choose not to audition or don't get for-credit lessons, you can pay to receive piano lessons from a YSM graduate student. There is an official audition (you won't get rejected even if you can't play at all---it's simply to choose an appropriate teacher), and the pay is somewhere around $350 for 6 lessons in a semester, or $550 for 10 lessons in a semester. \n\n\\- Outside of these two choices, you can join one of the many, many music groups on campus that exist at all levels, to continue playing piano with other people. \n\n\\- You can take classes in the music department, in music theory or history or even in performance (there's a chamber music class), to continue learning about music and about your instrument. \n\n\\- There are acoustic pianos (including grands) in every residential college, and you can get access to nicer practice rooms in the YSM as well.",

If you\u2019re interested in private lessons, you could definitely ask a current YSM student (most of them teach at least a little bit). Class-wise, I think there\u2019s a keyboard skills class in the Dept of Music, but that might be beginner-focused.",

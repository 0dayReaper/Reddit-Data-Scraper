It shows up on my connect as first.last but when I go to login on EliApps or Outlook, I get an error message or an invalid email page. My NetID is fine, but I can\u2019t access the actual mailbox. Has anyone had this same issue? Who should I contact?",

You will need to activate the NetID first then set up Duo Mobile for it to work. Once you log in to CAS, it will redirect you to your inbox.\n\nIf you need more help, maybe reach out to your Admissions officer for help with redirecting or email the general first-year contact: [first-year.affairs@yale](mailto:first-year.affairs@yale) \\- good luck!",

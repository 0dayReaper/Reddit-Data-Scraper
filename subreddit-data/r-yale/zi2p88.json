    "postText": "Hi everyone \n\nI am an incoming postgrad associate starting at Yale in the new year. I am moving from Canada on a J-1 visa and I require insurance as per my requirements. I have been looking at health insurance options and I'm wondering: \n\n1) Is anyone enrolled in Yale Health?\n\n2) Is it correct that its $855-$903 every month? Does your department subsidize some of the cost?\n\n3) has anyone used ISO international health insurance and would you recommend it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure if \\~$900 is an average cost of insurance in the US or Connecticut.. any help would be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "I believe the $900 is the total cost, but Yale pays the majority of that. I found [this document](https://your.yale.edu/sites/default/files/2022-rates-pda.pdf) and it looks like if you're a non-smoker you would likely pay $56 a month for just Yale Health coverage. I know the US health insurance system is incredibly confusing (I study Health Policy lol) so here's a bit of a breakdown:\n\nIf you're relatively healthy/don't have complex health conditions and you don't plan on spending much time in states other than Connecticut, the Yale Health coverage would most likely be fine for you. The Yale Health center is near campus and offers most routine services like primary care, pharmacy, acute care, OB/GYN, blood draw and diagnostic imaging, etc. They also offer certain specialty services like cardiology and endocrinology. Things run pretty efficiently there and so far I've liked all of my providers. \n\nWith Yale Health, you will need a referral from your primary care doctor for almost any additional care; for instance, if you wanted to see a dermatologist, you would need to ask your primary care provider to send in a referral before you could make a dermatology appointment. If you need anything that Yale Health doesn't provide, they will probably try to refer you to the Yale New Haven Health system first (they have confusingly similar names, but YNNH is the main hospital system that provides care to everyone, not just Yale-affiliated people). If YNNH doesn't have what you need, they can refer you to another provider within Connecticut. There are some \"co-pays\" for certain services-- for instance you would pay $10 for a month's supply of a medication, or $150 for a visit to the ER that didn't result in admission. Preventative care won't cost anything extra. Things will generally be less expensive if you go to Yale Health vs another in-network provider. If you click on \"Summary of Benefits and Coverage\" [on this page](https://yalehealth.yale.edu/coverage/managerial-professional-staff-and-faculty-coverage), that document will give you an idea of what things might have additional charges. \n\nThe cons of Yale Health are that they are a local plan only, so outside of the state of Connecticut they will only cover acute or emergency care. I don't expect this would be too much of a problem for you, unless you'd be spending the summer in another state or something. They also will not cover anything from an \"out-of-network\" provider, and they also will not cover anything that you didn't get a referral or preauthorization for (except emergency care). The main reasons to get one of the Aetna plans instead of the Yale Health plan would be if you wanted more flexibility to choose providers or you wanted to access care in the US outside of CT. [Here's a comparison of the benefits](https://your.yale.edu/work-yale/benefits/benefits-enrollment-2023/postdoctoral-associates-benefits-2023#medical-insurance) between the Yale Health and Aetna plans. \n\nThere are some other fine details like out-of-pocket maximums, co-insurance, what terms like in-network and out-of-network mean, etc that could be confusing but that last link has some definitions in the footnotes, and member services should be able to answer other questions you have. Hope this was helpful, might have been a little overkill but I know how confusing all this can be! Best of luck",

They also offer relatively cheap plans for students under 21. I\u2019m part of the essential plan and the insurance has covered my medical services, even ones that weren\u2019t previously covered by my college insurance. It\u2019s also super easy to apply which is a plus. I\u2019ve attached links incase you want to look into their plans and apply. Hope that helps! \nwww.kimberhealth.com www.kimberhealth.com/application/2316",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a newbie, upcoming fresh meat on campus and was wondering how EPE is. Like does the stuff u learn have job translatability or is it basically an art degree for the social sciences?  Also what about the Econ comp sci combined major. Anyone know anything about that?",

            "comment": "imo epe has little transferability unless you go hard on the econ and econometrics and then go into finance/consulting/etc, which many people do. otherwise, you're just gonna learn a bunch of political theory, political philosophy, ethics, etc. which are very cool to think about but not much use when applying to jobs in my experience. however, the freedom you get to essentially design your own concentration made it worthwhile for me. you basically make your own major within the confines (and even a little beyond in my case) of these three fields and that made undergrad incredibly rewarding in the academic sense",

It\u2019s not uncommon for people to major in History, English, ER&amp;M, Classics, etc. then still end up at MBB.",

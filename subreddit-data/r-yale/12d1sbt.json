    "postText": "Hello all, I'm not sure if this is the best way to go about this, but I am trying to live close to campus and also live with my dog. My dog is 24-25 ish pounds, is people friendly, is used to living with a cat, and may be good with living with other dogs (we can meet up prior in order to test it out). \n\nI hear that the 151-187 Mansfield apartments (which are 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom) are pet friendly. So, I am planning on applying to 175 Mansfield Street through the Elm Campus Partners website. I am looking for a roommate to share the cost of rent which is about $1755, so the split would make it around 900 dollars each. \n\nI am a new MSCS student in the 2 year track, female, like studying with music on, and like watching videos/shows out loud. If you don't mind the music or shows in the background, and are interested in perhaps bringing your pet onto campus as well, please let me know through chats or PM! The apartment is pretty close to science hill and the CS department on campus, so hopefully that interests you. I don't mind messes (I'm not cleaning every day).\n\nI am more in favor of a female roommate, but I don't mind a guy either. Again, please let me know if you are interested, and hopefully this is an okay place to post this? I am also considering posting on the Facebook groups as well. If you have any experiences with the Mansfield apartments or Elm Campus Partners, please feel free to let me know how that went as well.\n\nThanks all!\n\nEDIT: It looks like the apartment I had an eye on has been unfortunately taken by someone else at this time, so I will have to find a different place.",

I double checked with the ECP just to make sure as well. I will do a triple check just in case when I sign the lease if I am able to get the apartment!",

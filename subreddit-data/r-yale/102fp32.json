    "postText": "Time-urgent so any response would be much appreciated. I'm a Yale College student who sent a package to the B&amp;N Package Center instead of my home. The Package Center said they could hold the package until the 13th but not until the 16th when I arrive from winter break. Is there anyone on campus who would be willing to pick up the package anytime between now to the 13th? Will pick it up from you on Jan 16. I'll give you the formal authorization, and am willing to pay for this, since it's a package of relative importance to me.\n\nAny response or suggestions would be highly appreciated. Thank you all!",

    "postText": "I am a rising junior, who has a 3.8 GPA (got two poor grades during a really personally rough semester), and have been concerned about my future prospects for law school. I will begin studying for my LSAT this summer and hope to take it for the first time early next year, just to give myself the option to apply for junior deferral programs. Would the fact that I went to Yale compensate at all for the lower GPA during law school applications? Could anyone speak to their experiences or knowledge on this? I\u2019m first-gen and also just have no idea about how law school applications work so any info would be helpful",

As someone with no knowledge of the process, I started following it about a year before I applied and picked up some very helpful information (now headed to Yale Law in the fall).

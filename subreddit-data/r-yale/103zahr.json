    "postText": "Hi everyone. I am a student working on a project with Community Partners, a nonprofit based in California, to compare how different campuses across the US are meeting the needs of their disabled and neurodivergent students. If you identify as such, please consider helping by answering a few questions.\n\nYou can take the survey on Qualtrics for complete anonymity (no registration required, and no personally identifying info is requested or recorded): [https://tinyurl.com/yaleDq](https://tinyurl.com/yaleDq)\n\nOr feel free to reply within this thread:\n\n1. Are all campus buildings physically accessible to students who use wheelchairs or other mobility aids?\n2. Digital accessibility: Are class session recordings readily available for all large lecture courses?\n3. How much time do students have between consecutively scheduled classes?\n4. Are students required to provide documentation of disability to qualify for receiving **initial** accommodations?\n5. What is the wait time for an initial appointment with your campus' psychological counseling services?\n6. Is there required diversity and inclusivity training for faculty/staff/and students, **and** does training include recognition of neurodivergence and disability?\n7. Have you experienced ableism, discrimination, or seen/ heard any stigmatizing language on campus or on the college website?\n8. Does your college offer a Disability Studies curriculum? (feel free to skip this question if your course catalog is public and viewable online)\n\nThank you for your time!",

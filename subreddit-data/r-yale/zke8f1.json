I was wondering if there are very \u201cout there courses\u201d like at larger schools. I understand why you\u2019re saying that but I promise you I\u2019m not just gonna pick one of these comments and base a whole essay off it \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80, just tryna get a feel for the level of weirdness.",

    "postText": "Hey,\n\nI'm 21, living in Europe, thinking of applying to Yale, Harvard and some other US schools this fall. I arrived at a point in my life where I regret not applying after high school and want to appease my conscience. I had the kind of resume that could get me in. I did a gap year (in which I worked) and am currently enrolled at a prestigious uni in Europe in my first year. If I apply, I will do so as a freshman. Firstly, because I want the full experience, and secondly, because I won't have earned 100% of my 1st year credit due to not attending some classes bc of covid last winter. I am top of my class at uni.\n\nAnywho, my question -- is this feasible? Did you/ do you have any people such as myself in your undergrad class? Like, older, having done a gap year, etc.? I've heard it said before that some schools look for candidates like that because they're sort of like the \"yeast\" that binds a mostly homogeneous class of 18/19-year-olds together? I can totally see that because the experiences I've had these past two years have truly given me a different perspective and have changed me profoundly, and in a good way that would enable me to be a wholesome addition to a class of younger students. You say if it's actually done this way.\n\nThanks for your help :)\n\npeace \u270c\ufe0f",

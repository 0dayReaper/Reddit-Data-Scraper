    "postText": "Incoming Ph.D. here: Are there any housing options for graduate students that put an emphasis on social life? I found the professional graduate housing by Yale, but this looks more like life in an isolated single- or double-bed apartment with at most one other person. Certainly it will be impossible to find something comparable to the undergraduate colleges, but at least houses that have regular dinners in dining halls and/or social events? Thank you in advance",

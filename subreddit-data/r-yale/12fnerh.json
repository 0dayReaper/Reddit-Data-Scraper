    "postText": "Hello! I'll be studying Religion and Literature in the Institute of Sacred Music &amp; Divinity School in the fall. I don't know anyone at Yale/in the New Haven area and I'd love to get to know some people before moving there, so if there are groups for incoming grad students, or if anyone wants to connect and trade socials, definitely let me know! \n\nSome more about me: I'm 21F, coming from Boston with a Polisci/English BA, love writing and the arts, and even though I'm going to Divschool I've never been to church lol. \n\nThanks!",

People at YDS are on the whole very friendly (this includes staff and faculty as well--they're amazing), and I'm sure you'll feel at home in no time. \n\nThe YDS (and the ISM, to a certain extent) is still rooted in the Christian tradition, but it is quite inclusive of people of all faiths and none in my experience. I've had quite a number a friends who don't identify as Christian here. Also, if you've never been to church, my advice is to still try out Marquand Chapel; you might get something good, plus the music is amazing.\n\nDetails for the YDS orientation (BTFO, for the pun-ny \"Before the Fall Orientation\") should go out around June, and you'll have the opportunity to connect with your cohort online at that time. There will also be a Facebook group for Div School students to which you'll get added in a few weeks IIRC.",

You'll be able to find them on YaleConnect once you have your NetID. (Be prepared for the deluge of emails you get every week!)\n\nAgain, coming from someone who was not looking for opportunities, it seems to me that there is always something going on somewhere, either at YDS or hosted by other orgs!\n\nIs there anything in particular you are looking for? :)",

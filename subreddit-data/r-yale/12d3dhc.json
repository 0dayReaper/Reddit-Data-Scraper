    "postText": "Hi! I am a admitted student, and I am feel a bit nervous about coming to Yale. I was hoping to gain some insight from current students. \n\nI have done so much research, watched videos, etc. Based on these videos, people seem happy, but I just want to know the honest truth. I know it will be hard, but how hard to manage? I am pretty good with time management but majority of people are at Yale. I am asking this out of my nerves. I quite literally am scared of having to transfer out. (I know some people will respond to this saying, if you feel like you will transfer out do not come). I am up for any challenge, I just need to know what it entails. Are classes really that bad if you are not a STEM major? \n\nTo give some background I plan on majoring in Sociology but it is bound to change. \n\nAny insight about Yale is helpful to me!",

I see looking at your post history that you're FGLI from a rural background, and maybe you're worried that you aren't prepared enough from your secondary education. I came from a similar situation and have done really well at Yale academically. It's definitely a struggle sometimes, but never even close to the point where I've felt like transferring out (and I'm doing CS). You'll do great! There are a lot of support systems (especially during your first-year) to prevent you from failing.",

Can't comment on STEM becz I don't really enjoy STEM in general lol. I've honestly learned so much from my classes, and they have definitely shaped my personhood + challenged many of my assumptions.\n\nAs for handling workload, it's really up to your own decision. You can take 3 classes first semester. Or you can take 3 classes that are relatively challenging (~3/5 on coursetable) and 1 gut (easy) class since adding all the classes up together, the workload can get a bit intense. Start small and build up to however you'd like to work. Don't worry! If you got into Yale, we have so many resources for you to use if you reach out for them! Profs are often understanding too.",

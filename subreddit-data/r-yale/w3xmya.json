    "postText": "UPDATE: We were able to connect and I'll be returning her items soon! Thank you all for your help!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am an NYU student who just moved to New York and sent my books via media mail to my new address in late may. All my boxes came within two weeks except for one, which just showed up today. It was my original packaging but re-taped with a sticker on it that said \"REWRAPPED BY THE USPS.\" When I opened it up, all but four of my books had been completely swapped with someone else's.\n\nThe USPS told me there's basically nothing they can do (big damn surprise), so I searched through the books to see if I could find any clues wrt the proper owner, and it led me here.\n\nI am fairly certain that the owner graduated Yale in 2022 and goes by Rada K. (I won't spell out the last name for privacy's sake).\n\nThe books I'm missing are very important to me, and I am hoping to find this person and get everything switched back to the rightful owners. Even if for some reason you don't have my books anymore, I'll still be happy to arrange getting yours back.\n\nHere is the list of books I received by mistake:\n\nBaldwin - Collected Essays  \nHopscotch by Julio Cortazar  \nRelationships &amp; Life Cycles: Modern Dimensions of Astrology by Stephen Arroyo  \nParable of the Talents by Octavia E. Butler  \nAnother Country by James Baldwin  \nThe Story of B by Daniel Quinn  \nZami: A New Spelling of my Name by Audre Lorde  \nCuranderismo: Mexican American Folk Healing by Robert T. Trotter II &amp; Juan Antonio Chavira  \nEcstasy is Necessary by Barbara Carrellas  \nA Little Book on the Human Shadow by Robert Bly  \nDrink Cultura by Jose Antonio Burciaga  \nThe Wild Iris by Louise GluckThe Power of a Plant by Stephen Ritz  \nI Thought it was Just Me (But It Isn't) by Brene Brown  \nMy Ariel - Poems by Sina QueyrasI Remember by Joe Brainard  \nIshmael by Daniel Quinn  \nAfterglow (a dog memoir) by Eileen Myles  \nThe Road Less Traveled by M. Scott Peck  \nThe Holy Bible (pretty old with an illustrated cover)",

Last semester I tried to take advantage of many more resources than I had before but the results were still suboptimal. What are others doing to make sure they do well in classes. Thanks!",

It will not serve you well once you get out and into \u201creal life\u201d; in fact it can be downright damaging.",

In fact I don\u2019t mind not getting an A but i know that GPA matters to some extent right out of undergrad and but when considering grad schools.",

Take practice exams, revisit psets, do what you can to familiarize yourself with not just the content, but more so the format in which the content is asked.  Most of your grade comes down to exams, but in my experience exam questions closely mirror practice materials.  Go to office hours too.",

One of the things I dislike most about these classes is that the final grade depends highly on exams and not much else, so there\u2019s not a lot of room to mess up. Will be doing lots more practice exams going into the follow semesters. Thanks so much!",

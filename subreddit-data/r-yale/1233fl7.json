They offered me some financial aid (in the form of merit and need based) but I was definitely hoping for a little more. Has anyone had experience with negotiating financial aid a Yale? Wondering if I should attempt it. Thanks!!",

Bear in mind, graduate nursing programs are very standardized so you are not likely so see a huge difference from one graduate program to another. I would really think about it if you are going to heavily in debt for the rest of your career.",

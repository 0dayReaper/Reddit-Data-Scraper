    "postText": "My suite mate exudes an odor that is incredibly foul. It is so bad its nearly like an aura, and when he's around me it becomes immediately obvious. There are a couple of possibilities:\n\nHe does not shower. Nobody has ever seen him shower.\n\nHis roommate has noticed a 3 in 1 body/conditioner/shampoo on his desk, so even if he did shower, he would be barely using any form of bodily cleanser\n\nHe does not do laundry ever, so even if he were to shower, his clothes would still have the unpleasant musk.\n\nUnfortunately, this has gotten worse with the recent weather changes, it is so humid that the smell seems to radiate even further. His bed has become unbearable and I believe his roommate is extremely unhappy. Tensions are high, but we have no idea how to broach the topic. Please if anyone has any experience with suite drama please let us know how you handled it. We all like each other as people, and want to stay very good friends, this is just becoming a point of tension.",

If you're not a first year, suck it up and have the hard conversation. He might be mad at you at first but his quality of life will improve and he will be thankful for it down the line.",

In doing so, you can create a norm that will be abided by and prevent a messy fight that risks spilling over into the border regions. Additionally, you can start a new trend and help us all return to the state of nature we belong in.",

They would advise you on how to best communicate the issue with your suitemate or intervene directly while keeping the source of the complaint anonymous. There's pros and cons to anonymity - could be less or more dividing or tension generating depending on suite dynamic. If tension escalates, or suitemate doesn't change habits, good to have dean in the loop from the start.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a \u201827 admit and prior to going to BDD Yale was my top choice mainly due to the academic rigor and great campus. However, after attending BDD I\u2019m reconsidering. I\u2019m an introvert and struggle meeting new people. I knew this going into BDD so I tried my hardest to introduce myself to lots of people and try to make new friends. But it didn\u2019t go very well. Most of the people I met didn\u2019t seem interested in talking to me or already had groups of people they were hanging out with and didn\u2019t include me. Though I met some groups of Yale students who were super helpful and welcoming at club events, I left feeling like I didn\u2019t belong with the other prefrosh. Additionally I\u2019m concerned about the school being extremely competitive and cutthroat based on what one student said. I\u2019m wondered that if I do attend I won\u2019t meet other people like me and will end up constantly stressed. This is particularly disheartening to me because everyone I\u2019ve spoke to says they decided to attend Yale because of BDD while I felt the opposite. Did anyone have a similar experience? Introverts at Yale, are you happy there?",

Many meet their friends after matriculating and moving into their dorm.\n\nPersonally, I didn't meet anyone during BDD but I got to know so much more people after move-in day. Some of my friends met people who didn't even choose Yale in the end. Anyway, BDD isn't really for you to necessarily make friends. It's more so an opportunity for you to learn more about Yale and its programs/offerings. Some people will make friends during BDD but not everyone does.",

I keep to myself mostly and spend time with a few close friends. I think clubs and groups are a really great way to make friends and be social as someone whose introverted. My advise would be to try to find a few fun ines with things that your interested in. There\u2019s a ton of really fun and casual clubs at Yale",

If you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re left with many other options, I want to encourage you by saying that by no means is BDD going to be reflective of your undergrad experience. Additionally, there was a current student I met at BDD that said he hated his own BDD experience but ended up loving Yale anyway. It\u2019s very possible for you to find your people when you actually attend the school, even if you didn\u2019t find a solid group during the three days. Whatever you decide, wishing you the best of luck!",

            "comment": "I just recently graduated and also really disliked my BDD experience because I struggled to make friends. Part of that was because I\u2019m introverted, part of it was because I\u2019m FGLI. I think it\u2019s true what others have said about BDD not really being about meeting people but rather about learning what Yale has to offer, but I also think that it does give a good indication of the vibe of Yale students/your potential classmates. You\u2019re not crazy to feel this way. \n\nPersonally, I socially struggled at Yale. That being said, I don\u2019t think you should write it off entirely, especially if your other options aren\u2019t ones you\u2019re thrilled about. Yale has SO many social scenes. You go to a certain club meeting and find everyone so obnoxious you can\u2019t stand to be in the room? Quit and go join something else. As a fellow introvert, I have two pieces of advice I would\u2019ve given younger me: be bold, and find small groups. If you kind of like someone\u2019s vibe, be bold and ask them to get lunch together or if they want to study sometime. I\u2019ve made excellent long-term friendships this way. And if you can, join things that will put you in proximity to others for long periods of time (kind of simulating high school). For me, that was being in a play where I made friends by seeing the same people over and over again at rehearsal. You can do this at any college you go to!\n\ntl;dr You\u2019re super valid for not liking BDD. If you weren\u2019t enthused about the university\u2019s offerings, maybe reconsider, but there\u2019s a huge variety of people on campus to befriend. I ended up kind of hating the mainstream campus culture but I made wonderful friends and had great experiences at Yale anyway and would commit again.",

All the friends you make will happen once you start Yale (mostly in your residential college) and you may never see the people you saw at BDD again.

BDD can be exhausting, especially since there is so much excitement in the air and so many events to choose from and people to meet. Even really extroverted people can get a bit overwhelmed. Among its peer schools, Yale is usually considered not cutthroat/competitive, but I\u2019m sure there are individuals whose experience is different, especially based on what their high school was like. I would recommend continuing to reach out to others with your concerns and questions, and definitely don\u2019t put too much emphasis on BDD. It\u2019s really not intended to be a time to make new friends, rather it\u2019s a way to get a feel for the campus, classes, and extracurricular activities.",

I'm quite introverted but ended up talking to a decent amount of people and although I shared your experience a lot of the time (especially with the pre-established groups of people thing), I think overall I did end up finding a few people that I was able to have less superficial interactions with, even though I didn't consistently hang out with them. I guess my takeaway from that is that finding the people that you meshed with really seemed like a matter of chance, especially when there were so many different events that split people up; it's just a matter of finding those people. At least for me, it was also easier to find people whom I got along with better within my major, which could maybe also be a factor for you. I hope that provides another perspective and if you want to talk, feel free to DM!",

The problem of being amongst a large number of new people is going to be true at any orientation thing like this whatever the school is. And the difficulty that one can run into in the same respect in the first year at school is going to be there at any college.\n\nOne of the nice things about Yale is that it has the smaller communities created by the residential college system. It makes social life much more manageable and less overwhelmingly large.\n\nI remember many people in my class of Hopper who were very introverted and found friend groups of fellow introverts and got on well and also had other friends who weren\u2019t introverted but who were very kind and considerate of the shyness and introversion of these people. I think that that\u2019s what you\u2019re probably looking in college for if you\u2019re introverted and that the Yale residential college system is well-suited for that. There\u2019s a good amount of care and attention available to each individual student, if the student wants or needs that.",

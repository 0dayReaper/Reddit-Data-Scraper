It\u2019s a very chill job and a perk is that you get expanded swipe access! Also not super competitive, in year\u2019s past",

It also does not count as an elective. \n\n100 and 112 are good intro classes if you\u2019ve never coded before and can help prepare you for 201 but are not required. \n\nYou can see the major requirements here: http://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/subjects-of-instruction/computer-science/",

All three of our positions don\u2019t require previous tech experience, and one of our big goals is giving students new skills and knowledge while working. I can\u2019t speak much to the \u201ccompetitiveness\u201d as a manager, but I worked as a cluster tech when I was a student, and while I was personally intimidated by interviews and applications, I found the whole process to be very open and welcoming! You can reach out to stc-hiring@yale.edu if you have any questions for us :)",

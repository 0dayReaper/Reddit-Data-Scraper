It\u2019s always possible to go into add/drop period with these 5 classes and decide if you want to take them all. I\u2019d probably recommend dropping either glbl musi or replacing French with a 1 credit class. First semester is a very important time for getting to know Yale",

This is 5 credits but everyone knows that labs are about a credit of work for half a credit, so realistically it's closer to 5.5 credits. Given that OChem is notoriously difficult and French is a relatively difficult language at Yale, i would suggest you drop a class. Even with a dropped class you'll be on the heavier side of first semester course loads but it'll be a lot, lot easier.\n\nMy advice is to drop GLBL 121. The first year seminar will be fun and given you are a freshman, it's the perfect time to explore alternative fields.",

One of the courtyards is right next to the huge wall of Sterling and I think it looks really cool. Dining hall food is mid-low tier just bc there aren\u2019t as many options as other places, but you could just eat anywhere. The suites are also pretty good from what I\u2019ve seen!",

Most would disagree with him.\n\nThe facilities are probably on the lower end - particularly the gym - but it does have a pottery studio, a theatre, dance studio and a couple other things, along with the stuff you'll find at every college (e.g. a library, music practice rooms etc.)\n\nThe architecture is incredible. Its courtyard faces Starr Reading Room and looks nothing short of beautiful. The dining hall is the same, but unfortunately serves mid food - it's no Saybrook, but it's no Morse/Murray/etc.\n\nThe suites I've visited are decent, though the common rooms can be small-ish. A good few singles from what I can tell. Also has a reputation for having a lot of wealthy students, much like JE and Davenport.",

For a long time, it was known as one of the poorest colleges and most willing to take students on bursaries/scholarships. Nowadays, there is (basically) no demographic and financial distinction between the colleges. The non-Murray and Franklin colleges have slightly higher ratios of legacies due to the ability to request your legacy connection's college but in my experience that difference is minimal.\n\nThe Trumbull sophomore suites are very nice. All 6 packs, with 4 singles and a double (I think maybe 3 sets of 3 doubles?). The suites that overlook the main quad have a stunning view and get lots of light but all the rest are still very nice. The one downside could be having a room facing York St./Toad's, which can be loud on Wednesdays and weekends. \n\nTrumbull dining hall isn't the best, which means that it tends to be relatively quiet, making it easy to sit with your friends and talk without disruption or difficulty. It also makes it very easy to get to know the staff. I do think it is a very pretty dining hall but I am also partial to the dark wood aesthetic and very much dislike the brighter halls (Pierson, Murray, Franklin, Stiles, Morse). \n\nBiggest downside to Trumbull imo is that freshman housing is in Bingham. Some of the suites are large and nice, some are almost insultingly small. It is a real mixed bag. However, my small common room freshman year just became a bonding experience with my suite and led us to become very friendly with the adjacent suite that had a much larger common room. Trumbull is also the smallest/2nd smallest college by class size usually which means that the community gets very tight very quickly. This can be a bit rough if you don't vibe but I loved it. \n\nOn the architecture, I would argue that Trumbull is Rogers' best work and one of the prettiest colleges at Yale along with Saybrook/Branford. The entire college is stone, unlike JE, Berkeley, and Hopper which all have substantial portions of brick. It's position right under Sterling makes the courtyard lovely to be in.\n\nOn the whole, while I was in Trumbull and will vehemently argue that it was the best college, objectively all the colleges are comparable and it really doesn't matter that much which one you end up in. There will be things you like about it, things you dislike, people you love, people you don't get along with.",

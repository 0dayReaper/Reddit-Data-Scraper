    "postText": "So my parents finally gave in and decided I should go to Yale. \n\nIssue is that they insisted I wear a tile tracker and leave my location on so they could see what I am doing.\n\nThey also said they could visit randomly anytime they want without letting me know. \n\nIs there a way to get around this besides the constant stress of spoofing my location? How closed off is the campus, and are there any areas restricted to students only?",

Once inside a college, the doors to dorm areas (stairwells) also require the ID key card again. And then the dorm rooms themselves are locked. Libraries also require student IDs to enter. It used to be more open to the public, but COVID restrictions and other security are now the norm. Your parents sound massively out of touch with reality and over protective. Sorry, but the sooner you can get away and find your own space, the better. Good luck!",

They can help put a plan in place to prevent that, or at least talk you through some options.\n\nNext year, I anticipate that security will be lessened because of COVID. The stacks in Sterling cannot be accessed by non-Yale students, and the same\ncould be said for all of Bass after 6pm (I think). Your residential college\u2019s own library requires at least two swipes (1 to get into the res college gates, and another to get into the library), sometimes three if you also have to swipe into an entryway. The dining halls will likely be open to the public again, but your parents would have to pay money to get in or use your guest swipe.",

    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m an admitted PhD student hoping to learn what living in Yale\u2019s grad housing is like, specifically in the efficiencies at Esplanade and York-Crown. \n\nOn paper, they don\u2019t look like bad options considering that utilities are mostly or entirely included, and I will likely be away during summers anyways. I don\u2019t plan on staying in grad housing my whole time at Yale, mainly just my first year as I get acclimated to my program and a better sense of New Haven.\n\nDo any grad students have any insight to share about their experience in Esplanade/York-Crown? Is it worth it, or are there really major issues? I\u2019m especially interested in seeing good photos and videos of what the efficiencies are like since the website doesn\u2019t really have any. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Welcome to Yale! I've lived in York-Crown for a few years, and I think it's a great option if you want to live downtown and you don't want roommates. A couple things to know- heating is not under your control. Only the first floor apartments have a thermostat and they are told to keep the temperature at 70 degrees. For most upstairs apartments, this means the apartments get very warm, so we end up opening windows in the winter. Air conditioners are not allowed, but many people disregard this rule. Yale facilities are generally pretty responsive in fixing issues, but this year we had some mice issues which was pretty annoying. They had an exterminator come by and put in traps every few weeks, but the problem persisted. Then again, most landlords in New Haven aren't great, so this might be better than average. I don't know as much about Esplanade, but it is known for having very thin walls- to the point where you can hear your neighbors having phone conversations. As for pictures, they just came by a few weeks ago to take panoramas of our apartments, so I think the website will be updated soon.",

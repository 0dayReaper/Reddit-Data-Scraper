    "postText": "I'm a freshman and I just got back from home over fall break. I really liked seeing my family again and being back in my hometown. When I got back to Yale, I ate dinner with a bunch of other freshmen in my college. They all seemed so happy to see each other, but I felt like I wasn't super ecstatic to be back and they weren't too happy to see me. I don't really have anybody I want to see super bad here. \n\nMy suitemates are all gone a lot of the time and I'm not super close with anybody else yet. I feel sad and I wish I could see my high school friends again. I'm in clubs which will be fun to start again but I'm not dying to see them or anything. Does it get better? I feel weird for not being happy to be back.\n\nI'm also taking a drug right now which prevents me from drinking alcohol, so maybe that will help socially once I can drink more.",

            "comment": "Coming back after the first time you go home is hard for everyone, especially if you like your family/hometown. A lot of people (pretty much everyone) struggle with feeling like this, especially during your first semester. I remember feeling like everyone else had a super close group of friends and I was the only one out, but as I got older and talked to more people about their experiences, it seemed like parts of my experience were basically universal. I think you should be patient with yourself and understand that this isn\u2019t a problem with a deadline that you have to solve right now. If you keep putting yourself in social situations, you\u2019re going to connect with people (clubs are great, and I made a lot of my closest friends through office hours and random encounters). To directly answer your question, this is a super common experience (even if everyone is desperately trying to project otherwise) and it will get better. Let me know if you have any questions, and you\u2019ve got this :)",

It took getting out of my comfort zone and joining campus social groups, where I was able to find a community. First semester was horrible. Second semester started off equally as horrible. Last few months of second semester it got better",

It takes more work for some people (me included) to make friends \u2014 you actually have to reach out and be willing to feel awkward or get rejected. And most of the time people are open to making new friends or at least conversation!! Also those first year friend groups often don\u2019t last past 2nd year.",

I haven't had a problem meeting new people, it's just been hard to get comfortable around them and really start to enjoy hanging out with them.",

You loved seeing your family and want to see your high school friends because they see you, know you, and that connection is real. The people you\u2019ve met in your house and classes aren\u2019t really friends yet \u2014 friendly sure, but not friends in a sense where there\u2019s emotional intimacy. That just takes time and it\u2019s one of the biggest reasons your first year can seem so disorienting. \nKeep grounded by talking to your family and high school friends over the phone while making progress with new relationships. \n\nAlso, alcohol is not the vehicle for making real friends. Things won\u2019t \u201cget better\u201d when you can start drinking. Things will get better over time as you adjust to the newfound autonomy and develop real friendships. \n\nHang in there, I know it\u2019s hard!",

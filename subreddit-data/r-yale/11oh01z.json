If your later application references an activity that you believe you\u2019re suitable for, or a supportive faculty connection, that can help.\n\nThat said, don\u2019t worry. There are a lot of great programs around. The important thing is knowing yourself and discovering a good path forward in life \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

I know they talked to the admissions office (the program director told me he did). \n\nThat being said, I did a bunch of other stuff in high school, so idk if that put me over the edge or not. Also, this info is now like a decade+ old, so take it with a grain of salt.",

No, and they spent a decent amount of time during the program making that clear to you, but that doesn't mean that the program isn't a good one or that it's not a good look on college apps and resumes. I did PLE last year, and it allowed me to really personalize my application to Yale through all of the experience and insight I gained in doing the program. It's a great opportunity to meet incredibly educated and well-rounded people and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. While I definitely agree that YYGS isn't a straight shot to Yale, I can't say that it decreases your chances. It shows an interest in Yale, even if your interest is just in the name. I think if you want to do the program and focus on your wording in your application, YYGS would  add to any application. I got into Yale early action for class of 2027, so I definitely think if YYGS is something you think you'd enjoy, it wouldn't hurt to do. Let me know if you want a little more info on the program or to see what I included about YYGS in my application. I hope everything works well for you!! :)",

The fact that you attended the program matters very little, if at all, but if it gives you a concrete sense of what you want to study at Yale and why, that's already a leg up on most applicants. You also get a chance to visit the Yale campus, so if you do your research on the faculty member beforehand, maybe you can even contact a professor you want as a future supervisor to see if he/she's around for a chat (many profs are not on campus during summertime, but some are, and you can always do a Zoom call).",

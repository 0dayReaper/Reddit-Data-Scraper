    "postText": "Hi! My A-Level exams start in less than two weeks, and results will be out a week before move-in day in August. I had A\\*A\\*A\\*A\\* predicted in Math, Further Math, Economics, and Physics, but I'm struggling to get even a B in Physics because of how stressful senior year has been with college applications and extracurriculars and everything as a low-income international. Most people say a slight drop in final grades isn't cause for rescission, but I wanted to know from current international students if they have been in a similar situation and can define what a \"slight drop\" really means for Yale. If you didn't end up meeting your predicted grades for whatever reason as well, can you please tell me what happened after your final grades were sent in? I'm studying as hard as humanly possible to make up for my terrible preparation, but if I still end up with A\\*A\\*A\\*B (or A\\*A\\*AC in the worst-case scenario) do you think it would be deal-breaker for the admissions office?\n\nP.S. I'm not trying to make excuses for my senioritis. I'm just genuinely scared, and some reassurance would really help, especially from people who had been in the same boat before coming to Yale.",

Besides, Yale is much more fond of academic probation (which means nothing) than doing something like rescinding admission.\n\nps - are you Sutton Trust US? i am also :)",

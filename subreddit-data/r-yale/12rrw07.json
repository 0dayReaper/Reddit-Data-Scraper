As the other commenter mentioned you only need 6 extra classes, so yeah you still have a lot of space available for other classes.",

Others make serious progress towards it and could have picked it up without too much extra effort (this was my case, I had 5/8 grad credits going into senior year, but decided to spend my last two semesters exploring other subjects). Numbers for other subjects like CS or History should broadly be similar.\n\nThe one exception to the above is the S&amp;DS BA/MA, which is ludicrously easy due to how many classes are cross-listed (counted as both undergrad and grad level). I don\u2019t know if the department is interested in changing this or not, but at the moment it\u2019s kind of an insane life hack \u2014 people are getting masters degrees and excellent jobs without taking a single \u2018true\u2019 grad-level class.",

If you love your research like I do and want to take fewer classes, this is great. You need to plan ahead to fit all the grad courses you want into your schedule, because only a few are offered each semester.",

            "comment": "It varies a bit depending on the department - iirc the ones in the science departments require a lot of intensive research, whereas the CS one just requires taking grad courses. As such, there's a smaller percentage of people in science majors who do the B.S./M.S. compared to CS/math. I have no idea about humanities so I'm not going to speak to that.\n\nThis also means it can be harder to be approved depending on the major, and even depending on whoever's DUS at the point in time you're applying. My DUS was quite nice and even let me apply some tangentially related classes outside of the department towards my requirements (which made sense in the context of my research/interests)",

    "postText": "It seems there many e-scooters being used around campus, especially up by science hill.   What do people do with them when they have to be inside a campus building (classroom, library, etc.)?  Do people carry scooters inside and keep them with them?  or do they lock them up at an exposed bike rack?  or do something like lock it up on a bike rack inside the gates of a nearby residential college?  Are there are any restrictions bringing them inside if you want to?",

    "postText": "hi! im a dutch high school student planning to apply to yale next fall, but since i cant visit the campus and ask a few questions that i have i thought id ask them here :) some can probably only be answered by other international students but ill just list them all:\n\n- can i get 7 hours of sleep every night and still stay on top of my schoolwork, extracurriculars and possibly a job? im probably gonna major in english or wgss and im planning to apply to the education studies program :)\n- is it smart for an international student to apply early action? because yale is my absolute dream school and id like to have my college applications out of the way before i start preparing for my final exams (im also applying early action to a dutch university) but i heard universities often defer international students anyway because they want to be able to compare everyone in the pool\n- if i use they/them pronouns, will that be respected? and generally how accepting are yale students &amp; faculty towards queer students?\n- what types of activities would i do during the international students pre-orientation thingy &amp; would i already be able to live in my suite?\n- are the astronomy courses that prerequire \"knowledge of elementary algebra\" hard? im definitely not a stem person anymore but i had an astronomy obsession when i was 12 so i thought id fulfill the science requirements that way, but because of the dutch high school system i wont have had any physics classes for the last three years when i go to yale (i will have the said knowledge of elementary algebra though)\n- this question needs to be asked so that i have a counter argument to tell my mum: do yale students fly a lot? (as in by airplane) because my mum thinks ill be surrounded by people who fly like 8 times a year and dont really think about the environmental consequences of flying (which i do, a lot) while i think most yale students would be smart enough to not fly that much anyway that is sort of a discussion weve been having\n- this last question may require a bit more explanation lmao but here we go: in 2019 i went to the west coast of the usa and one thing that really bothered me was how much sugar americans put in pretty much everything (bread, tomato sauce, you name it, there was sugar in it). now my question is, is this also the case in yales dining halls? because ive seen those \"what i eat in a day\" videos on youtube but obviously when someone says \"i had pasta\" i cant really know whether the pasta was sugary or not lmao (i guess my questions is just \"what do international students think of the food in yales dining halls\")",

            "comment": "* Yes but it depends on how much time you want to spend on your extracurriculars, how many courses you decide to take, how hard you party, etc.\n* I have no advice there, I'm from the US\n* As some straight white guy, note that these are just my observations, but: The Yale student body is very diverse, very accepting, and very, very LGBT. If someone addresses you incorrectly it's probably accidental and they'll have no problem with you correcting them. However, there will always be some small minority still stuck in the past; I have heard some... unwelcoming conversations between people who thought nobody was listening. For faculty I have no idea, my perspective again is limited.\n* No clue, am domestic\n* You'll probably be fine. If you aren't at first, you can go to office hours and re-learn what you need, and then you'll definitely be alright.\n* I'm sure some do. I know some of the more well-off students travel frequently and I have no doubt much of it is by flying, especially during the year, outside of breaks. But overall I think Yale has a much greener student population than most colleges. Most flying, both out of time and cost, is probably out of necessity. To get home, I have to take a couple airplanes, but if you're close to home at Yale/want to visit somewhere nearby the train is at worst several blocks away and you can take it through all the major cities along the coast. Amtrak is not as regional as NS.\n* Good question. While I can't speak to the food from an international standpoint, I can say that it's definitely healthier than what most Americans eat; I lost weight over the first few months I was on campus. You definitely will have instances where there's a lot of sugar, though -- the ketchup is always going to be very sugary, you have access to soda (and ice cream/soft serve, depending on the dining hall), there's desserts, I'm sure there's more. But it is not hard to eat healthy, especially if you like broccoli and asparagus :) For a better breakdown of day-to-day meals, I recommend downloading the Yale Dining app and looking at what there is from day to day during the school year. Now might not be a great time because finals are going on and there's all sorts of events happening.\n\nI know that I can't really answer everything, but I hope this gets some of your bases covered. I'm just writing to get some info on your post in case nobody else provides anything substantive.",

            "comment": "Yale allows students who apply for EA to apply to other schools - *just not other private schools.* At least, this is how it was in 2020-2021. Check the website or email an admissions counselor. You will also know by early-mid December if you get accepted. Since many other private colleges in the U.S. have application deadlines in January/February or even later than that, you can still apply to many other places if you don't get accepted. What I would do is fill out all of the applications early since you like to get things taken care of, but don't submit them until you get your decision from Yale. Good luck.",

            "comment": "some things i can answer, i\u2019m not international so i won\u2019t speak for international students:\n\nthe students are very accepting of they/them identities \u2014 yale is colloquially known as the \u201cgay ivy,\u201d which is really a catch-all for a very lgbtq+ inclined student body. as for the faculty, yes, most of them tend to be accepting. as in any university, you may find an asshole or two amongst some older stuck-in-their-ways professors, but especially if you\u2019re a wgss major or even in edstudies you won\u2019t have any issue.\n\ni know little of the oiss (for international students, pre-orientation) social scene, but i do know they help you set up things like getting an american bank account and phone number. it\u2019s very practical and from what i\u2019ve heard from my international friends, very useful. you most likely will move immediately into your suite, as pre-orientation is now required for everyone.\n\nas for the sugar thing\u2026.it doesn\u2019t feel like the dining hall uses much sugar? i\u2019m american so that\u2019s hard to gauge. you definitely won\u2019t like the desserts but as for the main courses, many of them are not sweet at all. the pesto pasta for example definitely does not have sugar; i avoid tomato sauce so i can\u2019t comment on that.\n\n\nas for flying, yes? we do fly a lot, but i think that\u2019s mainly a function of living in the united states. yale is in the northeast so almost all of the northeastern students take trains home (the northeast has a much better train system than other regions) and we take trains to travel into nyc, but many of us are from the midwest or the west coast and it\u2019s easiest to take a flight home. for example, i\u2019m from around chicago \u2014 if i chose to take a train, it would take me 2 hours to get into nyc, and then another 19 hours to take the direct train to chicago (and this is only one-way). a 2 hour flight is more manageable with yale\u2019s academic schedule. by that virtue, many of us are taking about -6 necessary flights per academic year (2 for thanksgiving break, 2 for winter break, and 2 for summer break), in addition to any class traveling (field trips to florida, etc etc) or conferences we attend.",

Flights are substantially more expensive in the US. There are no \u20ac15 Ryanair flights. Most Americans who fly do so for distances that are impractical to cover by other forms of transport. If you wanted to go to Chicago or the West coast you would fly, but in the Northeast intercity trains are common.",

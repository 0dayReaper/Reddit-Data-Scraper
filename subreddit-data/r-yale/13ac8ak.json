    "postText": "Hello! I know the housing form is based on personal preference, but I am stuck between two choices and I wanted to ask for some advice.\n\nFor the kind of suite you want to live in question: I am currently deciding between \u201cA quiet place used exclusively for studying, relaxing, and sleeping\u201d and \u201cA place that is calm during the week and study hours but is more active on the weekend.\u201d\n\nI am a very light sleeper and cannot deal with noise, so I do like sleeping/studying when it is quiet. But, I still want to have some social experience and I want to make sure I can still have that fun aspect. \n\nFor anyone who went through something similar, what did you choose/do you have any advice?\n\nI am probably overthinking, but thank you guys for reading this\ud83d\ude2d",

My reasoning was that you could always go to someone else's suite or a club or frat if you want to socialize, and you also have the ability to sleep or chill in your own quiet suite at any time, so it's the best of both worlds.",

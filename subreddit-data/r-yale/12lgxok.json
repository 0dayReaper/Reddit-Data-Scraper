    "postText": "Hi! I'm a FGLI admitted student for class of '27 from rural Florida. My family has never had anybody attend university in America, so being admitted to an Ivy league is like a dream come true for us all. My school is very limited in what it offered me for college prep, extracurriculars, etc. but I was able to make the most due to a really supportive community. Now that I plan to attend Yale, I'm slightly uneasy about no longer having that tight-knit community behind me anymore. Unfortunately, given our circumstances and a conflicting schedule, I am not able to attend neither Bulldog Days nor Yalie for a Day. I've only been able to attend one Zoom panel so far, which did help.\n\nI am part of the discord and admitted students network, but I am pretty nervous on where to even start in terms of socializing. I did sign up for a prefrosh advisor but haven't received word from anyone as of today. As a pre-med prospect, I am even more nervous about how competitive the internships/volunteering will be at Yale because it was already a struggle to secure some opportunities at my hometown. My school could only offer me a few AP and dual-enrollment courses to get me \"ahead\" of the game, but I realize that knowledge is unmatched to what Yale has to instruct.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to get at is in what ways can I ease my transition to Yale socially and academically from now until the semester begins? If anyone can guide me on what pre-semester programs I should participate in over the summer or courses I should brush up on, I would greatly appreciate it. I'd also like some insight into what the volunteering, health shadowing (or similar) situation is like there. \n\nThanks a million from a future Bulldog!",

It's designed especially to ease students into college life and jumpstart mingling and meeting people.\n\nBeyond that, Yale has lots and lots of opportunities for socializing, especially in the beginning. Don't forget - every other freshman is just as new and fresh-eyed as you are. The first month will be a wild frenzy of meeting people. \n\nAfter that, academic advising will follow once you get your bearings. FroCo's, deans, clubs, upperclassmen - you have lots of avenues for advising and advice. Go meet people, you have rest of your four years to get into med school. Relax and good luck!",

Don\u2019t worry, Yale has a TON of support for FGLI students, and honestly don\u2019t stress this summer. Enjoy the summer with your family",

I think having at least one person that you know when you get to campus will help a lot. That being said even if this doesn\u2019t work out, there are tons of opportunities during orientation and beyond to make friends so don\u2019t stress out \n(academically) honestly take a break. This is probably one of the only summers that you\u2019ll get a guilt-free pass to enjoying before the frenzy of research or internships start.",

Definitely try to plead your case and tell them what you said here: how you came from a school with less academic prep, you\u2019re FGLI and you want to build relationships with other students and faculty.",

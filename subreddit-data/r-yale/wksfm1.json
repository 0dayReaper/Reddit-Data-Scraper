    "postText": "Hi! I'm an incoming freshman student interested in majoring in either Global Affairs or EP&amp;E (possibly political science). I particularly enjoy international relations, global health/development, and ethics. For my first year, I'm planning to do: micro, calc, first year seminar, and one global/polisci/epe elective (fall), and macro, quantitative reasoning, English seminar, and one global/polisci/epe elective (spring). \n\nMy questions are: 1. Does this sound like a reasonable plan (in terms of having an engaging schedule, manageable work load, and working towards potential majors)? 2. How do I know which electives/classes I can sign up for? I've looked at a bunch of interesting global/polisci/epe seminars that don't mention any prerequisites, but I don't know if they're reserved for upperclassmen? and 3. Do you have any recommendations on good/interesting global/polisci/epe classes for a freshman? Some of the ones I've looked at are State of the State in Development, The Politics of International Law and Cooperation, Democratization, and Classics of Ethics, Politics, and Economics (once again, I might not be eligible for any of these). \n\nThank you in advance!!!",

            "comment": "Hi! Global Affairs graduate here (I'm no longer a recent graduate I suppose but decently recent). Your courseload looks good work-wise, but it's heavy on the quantitative classes. If that's up your alley, then great, but if you're just trying to knock out requirements I would recommend waiting on some of those. I always recommend trying to get as diverse a schedule as you can in your first year to find out what you like.\n\nAs for your other question, the easiest thing is to look at the numbers. 100s and 200s are intended for everyone, 300s for upperclasspeople/people in the majors, 400s for seniors, and 500+ for grad students. These are guidelines of course (you can ask to be in whatever course you want) but they indicate what level the course is. Not all courses in that level are created alike obviously. Also, higher-level seminars sometimes but not always give preference to seniority or people in the major. And if you have any questions, you can always reach out to professors, shop classes, or look at syllabi.\n\nEdit to add: intro lectures can be a great way to get a feel for a program too. Gateway to Global Affairs, for instance is designed to give you a taste of the types of topics covered in the major.",

I was/am a bit bummed about the amount of quantitative classes, but I guess I figured I had to knock out requirements in order to be admitted to the Global Affairs major and that these courses made sense since they are prerequisites for both Global and EP&amp;E. You don't happen to have a take on which/how many courses it'd be wise for me to take (in regards to the Global major application), and/or which of the above mentioned ones I can save for later? Thanks again!!",

You probably only need to take either the econ classes *or* Applied Quantitative Analysis this year, since you can do the other next year. Making progress toward your language requirement in your first three semesters would also help equally. And even though they don't encourage it in the same way, taking GA or GA-adjacent electives helps indicate interest as well (and helps fulfill major requirements). \n\nCalc won't do anything for you for GA and you don't need it for distributional requirements either, so that could be the easiest to drop, from a major perspective. \n\nEspecially if you're not set on either major though, make sure you try a variety of courses. It's not going to make or break your application.",

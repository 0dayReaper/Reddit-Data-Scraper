I\u2019m over the moon, and in shock, but I\u2019m nervous about having to move with my wife and 2yo daughter to the area from the Western U.S. Has anyone been in this situation, or know someone who has? It seems like an amazing opportunity, and I\u2019ll take any insight available. Thanks so much in advance!",

            "comment": "Okay so I moved from the west coast to Yale when I was 18 (undergrad) so it\u2019s a bit different of a situation. I\u2019m also in the process of negotiating a future relocation with my partner (we\u2019re now late 20s). No kids involved.  \n\nYale is great. There are SO many smart people and everyone you meet will be incredibly interesting. It\u2019s beautiful, and the winters are picturesque (a little cold for my taste but to each their own).  \n\nYale won\u2019t make you happy though. Yale is HARD. I don\u2019t know what program you\u2019re going into, but it\u2019s probably top-rated. Expectations will be high. Days will be long.  \n\nI had a wonderful adventure on the east coast and met some amazing people who have become lifelong friends. However, I chose to move away from my family and one of my closest family members passed away while I was in school. I wish I had gotten to spend more time with her, and I would have had I chosen to go to Stanford instead.  \n\nIMO, if your wife is down for an adventure in New Haven, it\u2019s a great opportunity. But new haven isn\u2019t for everyone and she needs to be 100% on board. And perhaps let her pick where to move next after you graduate. Location is hard to compromise on (not like anyone would be better off living exactly halfway between the places each of you want to live).  \n\nNot sure if any of that is helpful.  \n\nWhat\u2019s your financial aid situation like at Yale vs other programs you\u2019re considering?",

We\u2019ve been through a lot together already. \n\nIt\u2019s the Physician Associate program, so the price is comparable to what I\u2019d be paying back home (an extra 20k because Yale\u2019s program is three months longer). The program in my hometown would certainly get me to where I want to be, but Yale\u2019s program seems to be miles beyond the education I\u2019d receive here. \n\nOf course cost of living would be higher in New Haven, and my little girl would miss her grandparents, and vice versa. A lot to think about, but my wife and I are leaning strongly towards accepting the offer at Yale. You\u2019re input is much appreciated and was indeed helpful!",

Yale has tons of resources if you plan on staying in CT, virtually none outside of the northeast though so getting rotations will be about impossible back home and with that comes the prospect of getting a job back home dries up as well.",

This naturally comes with better opportunities for growth, and better first-time PANCE pass rates.\n\nI\u2019m aware that all of my rotations will occur in CT, but, forgive me, but I can\u2019t see how a degree from an institution such as Yale will limit my job prospects, or how job opportunities at home will \u201cdry up\u201d because I pursued my education elsewhere. Many PA students pursue their education outside of their hometown before coming back to work in their community, even if they have to travel across the country for their program.\n\nAgain, my primary concern is not comparing the programs, but how best to find opportunities to support my family during my education, but thanks for your reply, I appreciate the input.",

Nobody, and I really mean nobody, gives a shit where you go to school.

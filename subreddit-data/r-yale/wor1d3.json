    "postText": "I\u2019m planning on taking \nChem 174, \n\nFrench 170 (lit) or 183 (medical French), \n\nMusical theater performance I (if I get in lol), \n\nEnglish 114, \n\nA first year seminar (hopefully current topics in science) \n\nIs there any reason to take the regular orgo class instead of the one for first years? Do I also have to take orgo lab? \n\nI originally had Calc 120 on here but then I decided that I was insane. Good call? \n\nFor context on the French, I am bilingual. \n\nI\u2019m also a little confused on how the preference selection works. How are some classes already full if I can\u2019t sign up for any yet? Also, for some subjects I can only rank up to three sections (ex: orgo). What happens if I get in other classes that conflict with these three? Can I just not take that class this semester, even if other sections could still work for me? \n\nThanks.",

            "comment": "This looks a bit rough to me, orgo and Eng 114 are both pretty intense courses. I always recommend people to consider adjusting to Yale/college life as an additional class; it\u2019s not something to be underestimated. I would try to drop something from here and maybe add in the orgo lab (which is also a lot of work, for no real reason at all). Whether you should take the lab kinda depends what you want to do\u2026 what major(s) are you considering? Are you thinking about medicine at all? Etc. \n\nClasses are full because sophomores, juniors, and seniors already registered for classes at the end of spring semester. If you rank sections and don\u2019t get any of the ones you want (this is very rare), usually you can talk to the professor and move sections as this is always a bit fluid.",

First year seminars are often really light in work so that's cool. if you are bilingual then you will be fine with the french class. My suggestion is to take all the classes you want.

The only risk is whether there will be empty seats, though there's a waitlist feature on the scheduling website so you can call dibs. \n\n\nIt's also very common to email your professor with a scheduling concern so they can ask if anyone wants to volunteer to move sections to accommodate you.",

However, many classes that are full during Add/Drop period quickly dip back down once students get a taste of the class. \n\n\nYou can check out Course Demand Statistics (I believe it's accessible from Course Search) to find out how many currently have a class on their schedule vs how many the class can take. \n\n\nTbh a lot of people just bogart classes on their schedule so they can hold a place in line despite only semi-interest, so keep an eye on it during Add/Drop. I was on the waitlist for a seminar once with 18 oversubscribed-- by the second class, it was only 4 oversubscribed, and by the third it was below the threshold.",

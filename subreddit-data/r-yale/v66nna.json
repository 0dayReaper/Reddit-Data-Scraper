    "postText": "Hey everyone! I'm an incoming freshman to Yale College, and I've been planning my classes for the fall/spring and had a few questions. I want to major in Global Affairs, so I have to take Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Applied Quantitative Analysis 1, Applied Quantitative Analysis II, Approaches to International Security, and Approaches to International Development.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I have to apply for my major since it's limited access, and it's quite competitive, so I want to take the right classes to have the best chance of being accepted into my major. I was wondering what the best courses to take each semester would be? For the fall I was thinking about taking: Propaganda, Ideology, and Democracy, Origins of U.S. Global Power, Gateway to Global Affairs, and my freshman seminar. Would it be wise to swap out one of them for Applied Quantitative Analysis 1? I'm bad at math so I don't want to overwork myself the first semester, but Applied Quantitative Analysis 1 isn't available in the spring.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen do you recommend I begin my language? I want to improve my Spanish skills and learn Mandarin, but I don't know if I'll have enough time for that. I'm also interested in applying to be a human rights scholar, so what classes do you recommend I take to have a good chance at being accepted for that?",

            "comment": "global application considers how likely you are to finish the major as one of the important criteria. some of the major milestones are:\n- L5 in a language\n- Having finished/finishing Intermediate Econ (either one)\n- Having taken AQA 1 or equivalents\nGLBL electives are nice but theyre more about displaying your interest. AQA 1 is not that math-heavy; if anything it tries to be theoretical with basic statistics. I would say that if you fulfil two of these three, you are very much guaranteed to be accepted. I would recommend not stacking all GLBL electives early on. Some of them are good seminars that will prioritize GLBL majors anyway, so you can take them a bit later.",

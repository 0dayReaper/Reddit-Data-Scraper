    "postText": "Hi all! I was recently admitted to transfer into the EWSP and plan to study Neuroscience with the intention of obtaining a PhD. I\u2019m coming from a community college, I\u2019m older (27), and married (no human-kids, just fur-kids). I was wondering if anyone would be willing to offer their insights on the transition process as not only a transfer student, but one coming from community college. Extra points if you\u2019re a STEM/Neuro major.\n\nI was admitted to another school, and I\u2019m trying to get a solid grasp of both programs so that I can make a sound decision on who to commit to based on a few different life circumstances.",

            "comment": "Honestly, the Neuroscience department at Yale is a mess. I graduated last year with distinction in Neuroscience, and in the past few years, there has been an efflux of teaching faculty in Neuroscience \u2014 so much so that they didn\u2019t have enough course listings this year to fulfill certain major requirements (my friends currently in the major have told me they\u2019ve had to waive these major requirements to make up for this) . I cannot recommend a new student to pursue Neuro at Yale unless changes are made in the next few years. I\u2019d schedule a talk with the dean of the department (Steve Chang is super approachable) to see if there are plans to hire more faculty if you\u2019re dead set on Neuroscience. Otherwise, I\u2019d recommend you major in Psych with Neuro concentration\u2014 there\u2019s much more support for the Psychology major \u2014 or even Cognitive Science.",

To add insult to injury, most upper-level seminars cross-listed with Psychology give priority to Psychology juniors and seniors to preregister a semester before, while Neuroscience majors are left behind.",

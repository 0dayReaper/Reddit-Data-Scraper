The letter is just harassment by the DOJ and is meaningless. Unless they start an actual enforcement action by January, which I doubt they will, they are just culture-warring and blowing smoke for the elections.",

I welcome another opportunity for our legal system to take a stand against racism. And I\u2019m able to think about this case on its merits alone, even though I despise Trump.",

If that were the case then white candidates would be receiving preferential treatment too.  There is a floor for scores that needs to be met, but after that there are more meaningful ways of differentiating applicants.",

Once you are at a certain threshold you can learn anything from the best professors.  After that it's a matter of who represents their values best.  It's no different than applying for a job.

We will continue to look at the whole person when selecting whom to admit among the many thousands of highly qualified applicants...\"",

They also receive the best marks on extracurricular involvement and interviews. In fact, the biggest indicator of bad faith by these schools is that interviewers who meet Asian applicants believe they have the best personalities on average, but admissions departments, who often never meet those same applicants, think they have the worst personalities.",

Take race and name out of the equation. Gender might be harder because of team identity. We can get rid of the racist canard that Asians have no personality. Unfortunately, institutionally racist policies will persist at top schools for a while. It's also not in the interest of white Yalies to bring true meritocracy, in all its forms (tests, recommendations, activities) into the admissions process in a race-blind manner. In all likelihood, Asians would be the majority, much as blacks are the majority in football, basketball, track. Hard to discriminate in sport. Much easier to be racist in academic and corporate America.",

If he got 5 other Ivy acceptances its very reasonable that a couple lesser Ivies rejected him. My guess is hes a pretty affluent kid who went to Vandy--they have quotas to meet too--bc they gave him a full ride which Ivies couldn't because they are need based.",

But my point was and still is that perfect SATs are not automatic admission tickets to Ivies for black people as you asserted. Questions for you: Are you white? Do you feel that you are discriminated against in elite college admissions? If race weren\u2019t a factor is admissions, would there be more white people at Yale?",

I simply stated a fact that students with perfect SAT scores and GPAs get rejected from elite schools more often than they are accepted. Perfect academics are not enough, but you inferred that race is the deciding factor. You should really know better as a data scientist. Calm the fuck down.",

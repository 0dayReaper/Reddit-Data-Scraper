    "postText": "Does anyone recall seeing this \u201cfake\u201d email or could it have been a real invitation. I was digging through my old Phone MicroSD cards and this was saved in one of my phones from 2019. I am 99.8% sure I am not that intelligent, nor did I even apply during High School or even worked to go to college. I do recall that post HS I would mess around with websites to try and break them, or signed up to lots of random websites or just go on mischievous adventures on the web. Could this have been a missed opportunity or a very good spam email from its time. I dont recall nor have access to any emails from that time, as well I can\u2019t find any information of this similar image/spam warnings/advertisement/information. Anything helps so I can get rid of this 0.2% nightmare that keeps me awake at night.\n\n[Image and Video here through Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/zUuBMaD) \nCongrats to anyone that got accepted in 2019 for real though xD",

The letter has no clear errors and the addresses look good (no idea what the link itself is, though). The dates for Bulldog Days were Mon-Wed, which is correct. Yeah, this seems real to me.\n\nIf I remember right, though, the logins to see results were very basic. Probably easy to brute force or find a pattern. It might not be *your* acceptance, but I think it\u2019s *someone\u2019s* real acceptance.",

You would not forget applying. The entire process took hours over the course of days, had at least three essays, massive amounts of boxes to fill, and more. It was not a \"put your scores here and see\" sort of thing. If you don't remember applying, and also still remember most of age 17 (so not completely blacked out the entire time), you did not apply. Maybe someone else did on your behalf (unlikely; would have required an incredible amount of personal information and somehow hiding it from you for a long time while the school was trying to contact you). Maybe you hacked someone's acceptance (did any friends apply)? Or maybe someone posted this publicly and you just took a video. But I guarantee there is no chance in hell you applied and don't remember.",

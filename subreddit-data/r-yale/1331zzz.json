    "postText": " I'm deciding on what college to go to for undergrad, between community college, IU, and NYU. After undergrad, I would like to audition for the Yale school of drama.  \n\n\nWhen applying, does Yale care about which college I went to, or is it all audition based. What I mean by this, is if I go to indiana or to NYU, but my level of acting is the same afterward, do I have the same chance of getting in?  \n\n\nThe reason I'm asking is because while IU isn't a drama school, NYU is incredibly expensive.  \n\n\nAnother thing I would then consider is going to CC and then just taking additional workshops/classes, and then auditioning for Yale.  \n\n\nSo, how important is the undergrad college?",

            "comment": "While there are a handful of schools that are more represented among current students (and I wouldn't say NYU is one of them) there's a really, really wide range of undergrad experiences and it seems like they care very little about the name printed on your bachelors and more about who you are and what experience, training, and skills you bring to the table. \n\nThat said, think about how much exposure to theatre and performance opportunities you'll get in Bloomington vs in NYC. I saw another comment where you asked about Yale undergrad; I would not recommend that if acting is your end goal. It's much more of an academic/theoretical program and doesn't do serious training the way a conservatory does. \n\nI would also recommend setting some other goals beyond going straight to grad school and book a few shows, get some experience under your belt before doing your masters. While there are people who come straight from undergrad, the vast majority work at least a year or two before coming to Yale.",

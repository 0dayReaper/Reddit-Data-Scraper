    "postText": "Calling Yalies who have done the orientation programs, I have a few concerns and or questions.\n\na) How intensive is the FOOT program? (Also, how non-negotiable are the items, i.e. the 4 bottles of 750mL water bottles, can those be replaced with something else or substituted, and the 65L bag, regular snow boots vs. hiking boots, etc.)\n\nb) Is FOOT worth the added cost of supplies?\n\nc) How do orientation programs affect the move-in?\n\nd) What did you do and what did you think of it?\n\nThanks!!!",

            "comment": "I\u2019m not sure there is an added cost? They\u2019ve changed orientation programs for this coming year, all first years will go on one trip and the costs should be covered. You\u2019ll move in, have a few days that involve frocos and workshops and such, go on the orientation trip, and then return for a few more days of froco group/workshop stuff before classes begin.\n\nDid not personally go on an orientation trip but wish I would have done FOOT when I was coming in.",

If cost is a concern, it does say you can reach out for help acquiring equipment. \n\nIn my personal experience doing backpacking trips, hiking books are much different from snow boots, and snow boots will likely be way too warm for comfort. Not sure about other substitutions, hopefully someone else can chime in there.",

            "comment": "a) depends on your specific FOOT program, you can choose a more or less intensive trip. Water is definitely non-negotiable, you will need all 4 of those bottles trust me. Hiking boots for sure. \n\nb) Yes \n\nc) see the other comment for this \n\nd) I did the 6-day white mountains (?) FOOT trip and it was an awesome experience. Wish I could do it multiple times tbh.",

I would recommend just doing the day trips if they offer it.\n\nb) I would say so, if you're an outdoorsy in-shape person.  They tend to cover expenses for those on significant financial aid.\n\nc) You just show up earlier than the rest.  I think the move in dates for first years for us was right before the first year orientation stuff, with preorientation right before.\n\nd) I thought it was an incredible but challenging experience.",

            "comment": "a) I did a moderate intensity trip. I'm a fit person who also happened to have little hiking and zero backpacking experience. I honestly found it very intense; the first day especially was brutal for me (though the next few days I found not too bad). The backpack really weighs on you. I would choose a less intensive trip if I were you, unless you have experience.\n\nb) Yeah, I absolutely loved it.\n\nc) See other comment\n\nd) My group hiked in the Catskills. It was spectacular, very beautiful, and a great bonding experience. I know very few people who didn't like their FOOT trip.",

    "postText": "Dear r/Yale Community,\n\n\u200bToday, we want to discuss an urgent matter that affects both the moderators and users. As you may be aware, the recent announcement made by Reddit regarding their APIs have raised significant concerns within the Reddit community.\n\nStarting on July 1st, Reddit has unilaterally decided to impose exorbitant charges on third-party app developers (Relay, Reddit is Fun, Apollo, Baconreader, Narwhal etc.) for utilizing their API. This decision has far-reaching consequences that not only hinder app developers but also affect the experience of moderators and users alike. The lack of maturity in Reddit's official app has made it difficult for us to fulfill our responsibilities as moderators efficiently, and it has also left many users dissatisfied with their browsing experience.\n\nIn response to this situation, the moderators of r/Yale have joined forces with other subreddit communities and their respective mod teams in a coordinated effort. We believe that unity is essential in driving change and advocating for the rights of app developers and the overall user experience. To amplify our message and demonstrate the strength of our concerns, r/Yale will be participating in a temporary blackout starting on June 12th, lasting for 48 hours. We haven't decided yet if this will be a 48-hour protest or if it will last longer, depending on how Reddit responds.\n\nDuring this blackout period, the subreddit will be set to private, rendering it inaccessible to all users. This collective action is intended to raise awareness and urge Reddit to reconsider their recent API changes. Our primary goal is to initiate a productive dialogue with Reddit, leading to a reversal of the detrimental modifications they have implemented.\n\nWe understand that this blackout may cause temporary inconvenience to our community, and for that, we apologize. However, we firmly believe that this short-term disruption will bring long-term benefits for every user. By standing together with other subreddit communities, we hope to send a clear message to Reddit and foster a meaningful conversation about the future of their API policies.\n\nIn the meantime, we encourage you to let reddit know that you disagree with their planned changes\n\nThere are a few ways you can express your concerns:\n\n* Email Reddit (contact@reddit.com) or create a support ticket to communicate your opposition to their proposed modifications.\n\n* Share your thoughts on other social media platforms, spreading awareness about the issue.\n\n* Show your support by participating in the Reddit boycott for 48 hours, starting on June 12th.\n\nWe appreciate your understanding, support, and active participation in this important endeavor. It is through the strength and dedication of our community that we can strive for a better Reddit experience for everyone involved. For more information on the ongoing situation and what you can do to help, see [this post](https://reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/).\n\nThank you,\n\nThe Mod Team of r/Yale",

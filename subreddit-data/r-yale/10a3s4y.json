If they are all submitted and your financial aid package didn\u2019t come with your acceptance, then they usually process it alongside RD fin aid and you\u2019ll receive it when the RD results come out in March.\n\nI may be wrong, but source: I also did REA and submitted my forms late. I called the fin aid office and asked when the package would come out if not with my result and they said with the RD students\u2019.\n\nI ended up getting mine with my admission offer though, so maybe you submitted even later? I would just call and find out",

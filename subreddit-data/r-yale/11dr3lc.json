Remember there are other factors that go into admissions so do not fret at all.  You should be focused on most about the fact that your essays, what you will contribute to Yale, and who are as a person shined through the best way you could. Best of luck and please don\u2019t worry about that at all, we are human. I wouldn\u2019t send an email to Yale, however. You are not gaining anything by doing that and they already have a strong idea of your scholastic aptitude even with two B\u2019s.",

First of all, I wouldn\u2019t send an email over two B\u2019s because those two marks will not adversely affect your application (vs. having two C\u2019s for instance) and is really not something to \u201cemail\u201d the admission officers about or draw attention to, it *might* come off the wrong way as well. Two B\u2019s with a excellent academic record all throughout high school will not affect an application, please trust me on this. \n\nSecond, senior year first semester grades are not the most important grades unless they are being used to show an upward trend in one\u2019s academic achievement for lower grades shown in previous years, so no that\u2019s not the case, most especially for prestigious schools like Yale. I would say in the applicant\u2019s case that junior year grades will be what admissions will be the most focused on.\n\nHowever, if the applicant wants to email, it is their choice.",

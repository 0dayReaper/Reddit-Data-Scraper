I think one of the great things that FSY does is to make sure that we are adequately supported throughout the summer, especially considering the various backgrounds that all of us are coming in with! My Professor always made sure to be readily available to meet during office hours and we are assigned a writing partner that is there to help us through the process and provide feedback. As far as I know, the majority of people did receive A's and the lowest I've heard of someone getting is a B. Overall, the professors are very understanding of things and will be there to support you :)",

I'm not sure how rigorous the courses will be, which scares me as I would rather not start off my Yale academic career with a less than stellar start. Also, I'm not great at math and it's been a while since I've done real math work, so I'm worried about diving right back into headfirst this summer. On the flip side, it'd obviously help with the transition into Yale. As a side note, I don't know what major or path I want to pursue, so picking the right classes would be tough.\n\n2. Friends. I think that FSY would provide me with a great opportunity to adjust socially and make good friends at Yale, but I also have my friends back home. This is essentially the last time I get to hang out with them for an extended period of time before we all head our separate ways, and to spend my entire summer at Yale would break my heart. I've been looking forward to this summer where'd I be relatively stress-free where I'd spend a ton of time with my friends, and going to FSY would obviously cap that.\n\n3. Am I even guaranteed a spot? It seems more people were nominated than they have spots, so it'd be annoying if I were to accept my FSY offer only to find out I couldn't go. This isn't a real holdback tbh, just something that's crossed my mind lol.",

FSY is meant to provide you the structure to combat the rigor that you\u2019ll face here, not to be some absurdly difficult program. It will help you make connections with professors, people in the FGLI community, teach you better studying techniques, help you access tutoring resources, and much much more. If you are concerned about rigor in general, you are much better off attending FSY than not.\n\nFriends - I can\u2019t speak to this, other than to say that you will be very rewarded socially at FSY. Another commenter mentioned that FSY often leads to some of the longest-lasting friendships here, and from what I\u2019ve seen/heard that is true. But if you feel that the best thing for you is to stay home and be with your friends, just do that. Speaking from the point of view of a college senior, what I have to say about that is a little callous but true \u2014 I only wish I had more time with the amazing people I\u2019ve met here, and the people you\u2019re meant to stay friends with from high school will stay your friends, regardless of a summer spent away. I understand though that as a high school senior I probably would have been concerned about the same thing as you.\n\nSpot - No idea how this works, but I\u2019m sure other FSY participants in this thread can speak to it :)",

The curriculum is only 1.5 credits (compared to an average of 4--5 credits a semester). They also significantly shorten the workload (our final research paper was only like an 8 page requirement) because of the timeframe. \n\n\nMeeting 75 people and getting to know campus before the start of your freshman year is an incredible headstart. \n\n\nAlso, keep in mind that this is essentially free summer school, which opens up your schedule for the later years.

If it's the same as when I went, it's Statistics, Intro to Calc I, and Intro to Calc II. The math course was only half a credit, so it was pretty much just two lectures and a problem set a week then a final. There are sessions with ULAs (tutors for the course) every week to go over the problem set material, and you can work in groups on the problems, so you can reach out to your friends if you don't understand something.\n\nDouble-spaced 12 point, and by \"research,\" I mean the kind where you check out a bunch of library books and cite some authors to make your points, not like actual primary investigation \n\n2). Your FSY info should have an overview of the curriculum, and beyond that, you can use the website \"coursetable\" to find descriptions, reviews, and difficulty ratings on courses, or you can check out courses.yale.edu for a class description and syllabus\n\n3). Yale has a distribution system for graduation where courses may have an attached \"distribution credit\" that can count toward the total you'll need. \n\nYou'll need 36 normal credits to graduate (as in, just make sure you get 4.5 courses a semester), but you'll need some of those to be \"writing\" courses, some to be \"quantitative reasoning,\" etc. \n\nYou can check all this stuff on your \"Degree Audit\" page on SIS, which I think you can access even if you have no declared major yet\n\nHere's a breakdown: \n\nWR:  Writing courses. These are usually assigned on the basis of whether a course will make you write about 20 pages of material, so they can be in any subject. Most students need 2 WR credits to graduate. FSY has English 114, which will give you your first. I did my second in a history class junior year. These are often seminars, so they can be hard to get into and you want to make sure you like the subject. (\"Seminar\" meaning the class size will be limited to like 20 people whereas a lecture can have 300)\n\nQR: Quantitative reasoning. I think you need 2? but I never paid attention to it. Any math course will give you one, but there are also some science courses that will. There are a few courses that kind of flub the designation that the humanities majors love to take to avoid much math. \n\nL: Language. There are specific intro language courses to take so you'll know them. Most people need 3 semesters of one, but if you place into a high level at the start then it's fewer. These classes are a pain and a half because they meet 5 days a week and have daily homework and class participation. Needs to be completed by the end of your junior year. You can take an online placement test before the start of the semester if you want to start at an intermediate level in a language, or you can start learning an entirely new language at L1. \n\nThe others are more subject distribution than work-type distribution: \n\nSc: Qualifies as a science class \n\nSoc: Qualifies as a social science class \n\nHu: Qualifies as an arts &amp; humanities class. \n\n\nThey use these just to make sure you get enough exposure. Most courses will have a subject designation like that, but fewer courses satisfy the work-type ones above. You can use coursetable to filter courses by the type of distribution credits they have when you start to schedule your first semester.",

I remember having like a week of sleepovers with my buddies to get 100% completion on Spider-Man PS4 before I left.  \n\n\nFSY is definitely about the most fun thing you can do with your summer. It's more work, but that work is also *engagement*, ya know? Like personally, I much preferred writing essays in the common room with my friends than what I would have been doing at home, which is sitting alone playing video games for 12 hours a day.  There's also an activity about every week, like water balloon fights or the ropes course and beach trip.",

I opted for one that was about narrative structures, so we'd have to read excerpts about narrative elements and wrote an essay over the movie Memento.

Generally there will also be summer session srudents on campus. \n\n\nDefinitely pack minimally. Not worth it at all to decorate your dorm because 1. you won't be there often 2. time flies 3. it's not going to be your freshman year dorm.\n\n\nEssentially all you really need are stuff like bedsheets, towels, shower caddy, laundry bag, swimsuit, athletic wear, etc. You'll want a fan, but it's better to just get one in New Haven than try to pack one. You'll need paper and pencil and whatever you need to organize it (like a binder), which you can either pack or get from Family Dollar or Stop &amp; Shop pretty easily. \n\n\nThey should provide a list of everything you might need to remember to pack, but a lot of it will be pretty superfluous",

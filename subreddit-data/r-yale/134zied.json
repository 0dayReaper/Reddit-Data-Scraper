            "comment": "hi! nope you normally don\u2019t get to choose specifically unless you have special requests (religious, etc) or if you have a family member that went to Yale before. Otherwise you fill out a pretty lengthy preference thingy they\u2019ll send to you, and the dean of each college personally reviews all of them and pairs you up with someone.\n\nbasically the flow is this:\npreference forms are sent and submitted\nyou are assigned a random residential college (unless you chose to be with a family member alumni)\nthe dean of that college carefully reviews the surveys of the people in the college\nyour roommates get chosen by the dean\nand the rest is history\n\nanyways the preference form is pretty elaborate, basically every criteria is on it. you\u2019ll know your assignment around late June i believe.\n\nhope that helped!",

If you aren\u2019t a legacy, you\u2019re randomly assigned. \n\nOnce you\u2019re sorted into your college, you\u2019ll get a housing form asking you about your interests and preferences. You\u2019ll be assigned your room/roommate based on that.",

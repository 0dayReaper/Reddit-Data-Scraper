Do you have a timestamp for the second video when Braasch told the cops that Siyonbola did not belong there?\n\nFrom the second video we hear Ms.Siyonbola say these two have never met before so there is reasonable belief that Braasch may not know if Siyonbola belonged there or not. \n\nMs.Siyonbola's frustration is very understandable and I think both she and the police officers handled this fairly well all things considered. For all parties involved I'm glad she recorded this.",

From what I've read in other threads, that dorm at Yale has multiple places and checkpoints where you have to use a student card to even enter. On top of that, the caller found her sleeping with her notes and writing material spread out all around her. Even if they had never seen each other in passing, which is unlikely since it is apparently a small dorm, how is it reasonable to assume under those circumstances that she was out of place? This student couldn't have been student-ing any harder but somehow she's \"out of place\" in the common area of her own dorm?",

That said if this person was genuinely concerned do you want to punish the student and send the message that the cops shouldn't be called? \n\nI don't think this would have been nearly as big of a deal if Ms. Siyonbola's name had been correctly spelled in database of students and the encounter had been much shorter. That's in no way the fault of Ms. Siyonbola.\n\nIn short no one as yet has shown there was a false report made but there is some debate if report that was made was reasonable.\n\nOnce the police officers arrived I think they acted correctly in making sure the person in question was a student and then leaving once that was verified. I would also agree that someone should discuss what's reasonable and unreasonable with Ms. Braasch.",

I immediately zoned in on the reasonableness thing, but as far as getting her any kind fine or charge for her call is next to impossible, and for the reason you stated. And I have nothing against that in the abstract because people shouldn't be afraid to call the cops if something suspicious is going on.\n\nI just can't even entertain the notion that she acted reasonably though. And for her to understand that, she does need a discussion at the very least...public shaming at the worst (which now she has to potentially face since she's getting her 15 minutes of notoriety). \n\nWith all the news going on, that woman can't be totally oblivious to the way police-black interactions can potentially go. What may have been just a couple minutes of her life to make that call cost Siyonbola that much more time to work on her paper in dealing with the cops and could've potentially cost her much more. \n\nThat woman was being much more than a mere asshat. A student sleeping is not suspicious, it's not threatening, and it's not an emergency. She could have asked her who she was, talked to an RA, even sent word to campus security, but she jumped all of that to go to the cops. She's deserved her spot among all the other trending news stories of white people calling the cops for things they have no good reason for.\n",

It seems you are applying the benefit of hindsight to the situation, a benefit the police were not privy to.\n\n\nThe police receive a call from a student claiming there is a trespasser in the dorm. \n\n\nThe police respond to the call and go into the situation agnostic. The police calmly question the subject who the call was towards. The police also question the caller. They do this in a calm manner. You seem to view being questioned about a situation as \"being treated like a criminal\". However, the more objective and reasonable view is that it is simply discovery, and getting a lay of the land. Remember, they went into this situation blind. They do not know either person. They question both and are serving as mediators and assessing the situation. You cannot assess without questioning. She could either truly be a trespasser, or she could not. And give equal credence to both possibilities. You have to find out by questioning (to which they found minimal resistance to, but remain calm)\n\n\nAt this moment in time the police do not know whether or not the call was legitimate or not. The lady claims she is a student and has every right to be there. Taking a persons word for it, is not sufficient police work (its not as though humans do not lie, and imagine if every police encounter ended with the person simply saying they arent committing a crime and the cops should just leave) \n\n\nThe lady opened her dorm room. This is a positive step the police seem to appreciate. One could reasonably say that was sufficient enough evidence to prove she is not trespassing (though i disagree, as did the police. However, i can see how a reasonable person could see this as sufficient). Though there are many legitmate reasons why this may not be sufficient proof for some. Perhaps its a friends dorm whom she was given a key to, and in fact not her dorm? Perhaps she found the keys outside and thats how she gained entry in the first place? Again, you cannot operate with the benefit hindsight (in this case, knowing she was in fact a student). The establishment of identification is a reasonable and civilized manner to end the situation. The lady provided the identification and the situation ended in a peaceful and calm manner. \n\n\nAll in all both the lady and the police handled it reasonably well. The only villain is the caller ",

From your post history I would guess not and that you jumped in here to argue for whatever reason.\n\nIt's not your fault, but you're deprived of context that is available to Yale students. There is active discussion on this topic in internal Yale facebook groups, as you might imagine, and the consensus is that YPD mishandled the situation. To your earlier point about the supervisor, all YPD are issued this device called a radio that was invented about 150 years ago. It allows the officers on the scene to inform the supervisor of what had happened and what information they already had, which they did not do, and which would have precluded the supervisor from aggressively questioning the student regarding information that had already been determined.\n\nYale IDs have two dates on them: the student's birth date, and the date the ID was issued. The YPD officers inexplicably assumed that one of those dates was the expiration date of the ID, which is baffling since if it is truly a matter of course for YPD to ask for Yale IDs to determine student status/residence, this is something very basic that they should thoroughly understand. This implies one or both of the following: that the officers were not approaching the situation \"agnostically\" as you say and were instead assuming that she was a trespasser with a fake/expired ID, and that the officers were very poorly trained and could not tell you what information is actually supposed to be on the Yale ID that they requested.\n\nFurthermore, you said the only villain is the caller. Why did YPD not ask the caller for her Yale ID as well to verify that she is in a legitimate position, as a Yale student/resident, to call the police on another person in the first place? Why did they give her the benefit of the doubt and let her walk away?\n\nLastly, this is not an isolated incident - YPD have a history of misconduct. A couple years ago, a YPD officer drew his gun on a black student as he was exiting the main campus library (a very safe area in central campus, mind you) while searching for a reported burglary suspect who matched his description. This was a totally unnecessary escalation of force directed toward a compliant, unarmed student that easily could have resulted in tragic consequences. So you can see why black students at Yale have a distrust of YPD and may react with agitation when confronted by YPD after doing nothing wrong.",

No birthday, only the one date with no indication of what it means.\n\nAdditionally, the cop in the video asked if the card had to be renewed after getting the wrong UPI back from dispatch (~8:08). It isn't brought up again until 13:11 when the female police office says \"it's coming back expired.\" The date on the card isn't mentioned until after this, where the female cop says she doesn't know if it's the expiration date or the date the ID was issued.\n\nBefore all of this the first cop was simply trying to confirm the ID was legitimate but ran into problems because the given name in the database and the one on the card did not match.",

I did not come in here to argue, and I hope my original statement in regards to people within the Yale community and my praise for them in handling a difficult situation did not come across as so. \n\nFrom the video evidence, and from what I have learned of the situation, i respectfully disagree that YPD mishandled the situation. And I would assume the Yale community is not monolithic in thought in feeling one way or another. And I assume you know this to be true as well.\n\n&gt;To your earlier point about the supervisor, all YPD are issued this device called a radio that was invented about 150 years ago. It allows the officers on the scene to inform the supervisor of what had happened and what information they already had, which they did not do, and which would have precluded the supervisor from aggressively questioning the student regarding information that had already been determined.\n\nOverlooking the tone of argument for time being, the supervisor seemed to have already been on scene but in a different room (notice where he entered from), likely questioning the caller. It makes little sense to radio someone in another room, and certainly when they are actively involved in discovery. I do not think he was being aggressive in any way (a bit annoyed, yes). But I am a little uninterested in that analysis because it is a matter of perspective.\n\nIn regards to her Yale ID. From what I've read, the officers were having difficulty cross referencing her ID due to a clerical issue with that data base because her name was spelled differently. The female officer asked her \"do you know whats going on with your Yale ID?\" because they could not locate her in the database. The supervisor asks \"whats going on with her Yale ID?\" and the female officer says \"its coming back expired\" (I assume this was in fact incorrect, it wasn't actually expired, rather they could not find her in the system due to the name difference - and she simply assumed it was expired). The female officer says there's a date on there and it would have to be the exp date or the date that she got it. The Student admits she does not know either. You question why YPD would not know what the date was for, a similar question could be asked to the very owner of the ID. And while they could not cross reference the student in the database, they gave her the benefit of the doubt that it was in fact still valid because she still had access to the building with it. The officers did approach the situation agnostically. Part of a true agnostic approach is to question the subject of the call, and to question the caller. Both occurred, and once the ID was given and verified (with some trouble due to systems errors) the officers left. A non-agnostic situation would be immediate removal of the student without discussion, or a charge of fake identification and then removal subsequent to the ID being issued (a true presumption of guilt). You are taking a line of questioning as a presumption of guilt, when in fact, it is simply a  discovery process\n\n\nDo we know that the caller was not asked for her ID? I am ignorant to that fact, and I do not know one way or another. But lets say she wasn't, for arguments sake. A reasonable person could understand why the caller of a trespassing issue would not be question if they were themselves in fact, a trespasser. Never the less, it would be behoove the police to ask her for her ID as well, and I hope they did - and if they did not, i personally think that is an error of judgement. But I do know they questioned the caller for sure, what those questions were: i do not know. It is interesting that they questioned the caller and you frame the aftermath as \"letting her walk away\" but when they question the subject of the call you frame it as a form of harassment (when in fact, they also \"let her walk away\"). But yes, the subject of the call WAS harassed. Though, it was not by YPD. Rather, it was by the caller. Who used the YPD who are bound by duty to take the accusation seriously, as her weapon. \n\nJust like no individual should bear the burden of his or her group, these specific officers should not bear the burden of other officers past behaviors. In order to keep society civil we must fight to treat each and every one as individuals. The past behavior of YPD is not the past behavior of these specific officers. If you could provide and display a pattern of bad behavior by these officers, then that could play consideration. \n\n\n",

Saying \"well the student didn't know either\" in no way logically absolves the police of not knowing how to do their job.\n\n&gt;Do we know that the caller was not asked for her ID?

The police were clearly not \"agnostic\" because they treated the caller and the black student differently even though they had equally little prior evidence that either person lived there.\n\nAs others have said, you seem oddly emotionally invested in this for someone who has no affiliation with Yale, to the extent that you actively sought out this subreddit and thread just to post multiple comments defending YPD.\n",

It's literally the YPD's job to know that info if they're using it to verify people. Saying \"well the student didn't know either\" in no way logically absolves the police of not knowing how to do their job.\n\nIgnoring tone of argument (once more) I do agree the officers have more of a duty to know the ID's well. Though my argument was not to set a sense of equivalency, it was to show that perhaps it is not a well known issue overall as evidenced by everyone's ignorance. I do understand how one may see my statements as so though, I do agree my wording was ill thought out. \n\nI am genuinely curious, what are the sources for the fact that we know she was not asked for ID? I'll reiterate i think the officers are behooved to do so. Though I can see how a reasonable person may understand why the caller of a trespassing issue would not be under discovery for trespassing themselves. \n\nWe do not have video evidence of the other person being questioned, may I ask what metric you are judging the unequal treatment? \n\nAgain, If i have emotional statements such as derogatory language, or take part in ad hominem attacks, please let me know. Its my belief that such things undermine my credibility to think clearly due to emotional investment and would actively like to correct it",

Amongst many other events\n\n\nId also like to note that your analysis that it \"has nothing to do with...\" - is likely incorrect. It has to do with it for the aforementioned reason, she mistakenly attributed it to that as a plausible explanation as to why they were unable to cross reference.

Though, it could be if you were to proudly reject objective reasoning and reject to treat each situation, individuals, and examples, in their own vacuum and upon their own merits. Instead you could proudly view all situations as a general theme you notice versus letting each example stand alone and to be judged for themselves with reason. Many police examples of oppression are seen by you, so therefore all police interactions where the subject is uncomfortable due to a horrible situation is therefore automatically a example of police oppression.

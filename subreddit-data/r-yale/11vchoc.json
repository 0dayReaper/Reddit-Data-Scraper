    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nTLDR: Heart says Yale, brain says MIT. Please convince my brain to say Yale. \n\nAfter a while of looking through the internet, I love Yale vibes much better than MIT, so I'm planning to commit to Yale. However, I want to major in something like CS/Stats, and MIT is usually ranked higher, which I don't care tbh. At the HYPSM, I think all schools open the same doors. I also got news that Yale is investing $1,000,000,000 into its STEM departments. How do you guys see that changing the outlook of Yale STEM?\n\nThanks for your help!",

            "comment": "I really think for undergrad the difference in career prospects would be pretty small if non-existent. Yale places extremely well at every big tech company and also at Prop firms if you're interested in quant stuff. For the most competitive jobs, the name of your school will help you get an interview (and Yale meets that criteria) but after that it's how you do in an interview that will determine whether you get the job. \n\nIf you really are looking to be constantly surrounded by tech and a startup scene then Yale would likely not meet that criteria. There still are great startups that start at Yale every year but the startup and tech culture is just one of a ton of active communities on campus.\n\nGo with your heart and don't overthink it. There's no wrong choice. When the options are both good, it's worth thinking about where you think you might thrive as a person. You're young and priorities change much more than you probably expect once you enter college.",

But if taking, say, a Philosophy or Daily Themes writing class sounds more painful than another problems set-you probably would prefer MIT. I went to both schools. (Yale undergrad, MIT grad) Both are amazing but very different. What kind of college memories and friends do you want to have. Congratulations on both choices.",

If you have any opportunity to visit and/or talk to current students from each, please do (feel free to dm me). \n\nI\u2019m not convinced that all the HYPSM open the same doors as you said. If you want to get into finance or consulting, Yale is a great place to be \u2014 all of our career resources are seemingly directed at that pipeline. If you want to do software engineering or data science or anything else in the CS/Stats world, Yale does not have those same resources for you in the way that I would expect MIT does, so you will have to figure it out on your own. As far as the $1B investment you mentioned, that was just announced; they do not have a plan of how exactly it will be used; the construction they\u2019re proposing probably won\u2019t even start for 2-3 years and will likely finish after you graduate, so I don\u2019t think this should influence your decision. Yale has been hiring more CS professors lately but the department is still experiencing tremendous growing pains from the last few years.\n\nWith all of that said, likely the biggest reason you would choose Yale over MIT is the non-STEM courses. You can major in CS or Stats and your major requirements will only be about 1/3 of your total 36 required credits, leaving the rest up to you. Go to Yale Course Search and see if you find classes you are excited about. If you want your degree to be 80-90% in your major and really go all in on that, you could go to Yale, but you might be better served by MIT. If you want more freedom to explore across disciplines, and the whole \u201cliberal arts\u201d thing is more exciting to you, then Yale has a lot to offer. Good luck!",

The faculty recruitment and culture adjustment to a large investment like the one you mentioned takes many years which you may not be around for. You may see changes in funding opportunities, mixers/pizza parties, etc, in the coming years, but Yales STEM investment won\u2019t be noticeable for a while. Also Yale is not very good for its STEM/engineering/CS (performance). And that\u2019s coming from someone who spent 6 STEM years there.\n\nDM me if you have specific questions.

Im from neither but looking at stanford and what they did recently gives pause. \n\nDidnt mit recently rescind an invitation to a big wig because of his supposed conservative views? \n\nI suspect that these \u201celite\u201d institutions are all the same. \n\nThe only exception i find is u chicago. \n\nRegardless, i wouldnt rule out yale just cuz. \n\nIf u think specifically yale because humanities = sjw id argue thats misguided. \n\nA good humanities education is probably the same salve that sjw people, faang enthusiasits, crypto bros, twitter warriors, and elon musk/peter thiel acolytes would all benefit from. \n\nTheres more commonalities amongst that crowd than youd think -lack of serious empathy and critical thinking. \n\nCritical thinking =\\= high math ability",

Surely you don't think that college nerds don't party hard, do you? \n\nAnd protesting wasn't any part of my extracurriculars, at Yale,  or even most of the student body, and I was there for S. A. apartheid. In fact, I'm going to say from personal knowledge that Kavanaugh, Wray and DeSantis did more partying than many of us did - DKE was a fun place to visit, but I wouldn't live there. \n\nAnd, sounds like you've not been to either.",

            "comment": "No idea why this was suggested to me. I got into Yale, MIT, Cornell, and Princeton for my PhD in engineering. I\u2019m currently choosing (will be choosing soon). It\u2019s very vibe-dependent and each school will open different doors.\n\nGenerally Princeton/MIT/Cornell have more of a \u201creputation\u201d for rigor (partially because of their STEM-focus) at the undergraduate level. Another school I\u2019m in at is UChicago\u2019s \u201cmolecular engineering\u201d though, and it should be said that the general focus of the school does not dictate the quality of any individual department. For example UChicago\u2019s ME is super forward thinking and with their investments, has great future. At the graduate level I\u2019m choosing more based on research and \u201cfit,\u201d so this advice might not be applicable.\n\nIn Yale\u2019s favor, it seems like they provide more paths for exploration, and is more free of the relentless \u201cgrind\u201d you might find at a more STEM-focused school like MIT or Princeton. \n\nActually, if any current PhDs have advice for *me* about this choice, I\u2019d love to hear it.",

However, being the selective school Yale is, I don\u2019t know if to apply or not. My SAT is not the best (although that could improve) but my academics, and my EC\u2019s are pretty good. Essays are to be determined, same with LORC\u2019s. Any advice?",

If you're a good fit for the school, which it sounds like you are, it will shine through in your application and that's really what they're looking for. Yale doesn't want 6000 people with perfect SAT scores, they want interesting people who will do cool things, and I can already tell you are an interesting person who will do cool things! Apply! :)",

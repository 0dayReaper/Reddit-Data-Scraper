I wouldnt give up though. I tanked my freshman year of undergrad but turned it around by junior/senior year and i still got in (aced all the exams) for grad school.",

You would have to do something extraordinary to get in (academic or extracurricular). \n\nI did slightly above average in high school, but I grinded hard in my undergraduate years and ended up here for graduate school.",

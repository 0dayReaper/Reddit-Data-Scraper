I\u2019m bringing my SO with me, and I\u2019d like to show him some of the places that were important to me: architecture library, the stacks, Bass, YLS library (yes, I spent a lot of time in libraries\u2026), my residential college, etc.\n\nDoes anyone know if alumni can get some special pass to get into buildings, etc.? Or will I have to depend on the kindness of strangers?",

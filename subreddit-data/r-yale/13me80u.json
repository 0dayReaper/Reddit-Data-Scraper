I also did not go to Bulldog Days, which is important to my impression.\n\n&gt; unfortunately the ppl i hung out with are not going to yale\n\nOk, their loss. You are not your random one-weekend group. No one. NO ONE. Makes their core friend group at BDD. At most, you have one fall-back \"remember me\" person from this. That's it. This is not a problem.\n\n&gt; i see everyone on social media having a group already at yale\n\nYou see the people *you met at BDD* having a group. Sure. But what about the majority of students who weren't at BDD? Literally in 4 years on campus I never heard a single person refer to their BDD experience. That includes my years, and the people I met while I attended who were at BDD. A few came and we were friends. They never talked about this time.\n\n&gt;who am i gonna sit with on the first day\n\nAlmost all interactions you have in the first few days will be scripted, controlled, and organized. The first day you find yourself in a dining hall without knowing anyone, sit down with the first person you see who looks similarly scared. I haven't talked to (name here) in years, but because I did this, and because that led to friendship over four years, I know I could call her anytime and have a friend. Early Yale is just meeting people. You say you're good at that. Just do it.\n\n&gt; like i have no clue what classes i should be taking first year;\n\nNo one does. And the people who do are wrong.\n\n&gt; what if my degree track changes?\n\nMost do, at least a little bit. I went from psychology to philosophy (and am now a lawyer).\n\n&gt; what if i don\u2019t wanna be pre med anymore and wanna be pre law?\n\nThen you make that switch. It's not hard.\n\n&gt; am i supposed to be researching classes?\n\nNo. When you get a book of possible classes (this if very likely all online now), read it. Decide then.\n\n&gt; is EVERYONE doing fsy besides me\ud83d\udc80? \n\nI don't know this acronym, but didn't want to cut it and make it seem I was hiding something.\n\n&gt; can i study abroad freshman year or like how do i even inquire about that?\n\nProbably not. But ask your dean once you have one.\n\n&gt;how the FUCK do you network \ud83d\ude2d?\n\nTalk to people. You're just starting out. You are not going to make the key connection in your first month. Probably you won't make anything super important your entire time at Yale. Just talk to people. You say you're extroverted\u2014do that.\n\n&gt; maybe i\u2019m just an overthinker [and the rest]\n\nLiterally just ride the wave. Yale is an experience. You won't know people going in. You don't know what you're doing. Coming out, you will. It's not a game, it's not a test. You can do it. GO!",

Bulldog Days is a fun way to meet some new people and see Yale, but it isn\u2019t the end all be all to making friends.\n\nOn the first day you\u2019re going be thrown into tons of groups\u2014roommates, FROCO groups, classes, clubs you sign up for. Most people come in not knowing anyone. And the people that do know people already are usually extroverts themselves and would be happy to include you. If anything your biggest problem will be having too many people asking to hang out/go to their club with them.\n\nAnd as for major stuff/study abroad\u2014don\u2019t worry about that yet! Your FROCO and Head of College will be able to help you, and you\u2019ll have a better understanding of what you\u2019ll want to do once you start.\n\nIf you have any questions about study abroad with the Light Fellowship, feel free to reach out to me! I did it twice and was involved with the student committee.\n\nYou\u2019re going to have a great time at Yale, so enjoy the rest of your summer and get excited to start in the fall!",

The first time I set foot on campus was the day I arrived to move in. I was also super insecure and shy with resting bitch face and a lot of social issues. \n\nGuess what! I made friends! Good friends. Friends I have had for decades and I consider family. Most from the activities I did. Go with your head up high and a little confidence. And seek help if things get overwhelming (this is the part I wish I\u2019d done). \n\nGood luck!",

I just made sure to take advantage of resources like the writing center to get help with essays and going to office hours so the academics parts turned out fine and Yale has a really active, really welcoming FGLI community so you\u2019ll end up being friends with all the FSY folks too if you go to FGLI community events.",

It\u2019s totally normal to feel nervous about college, but in my experience, 99% of Yalies are so welcoming and friendly, and it\u2019s a lot easier to make friends than you would think.\n\nAlthough I didn\u2019t experience BDD, there were huge GroupMe friend groups and Zooms that I guess were sort of our BDD. I also consider myself an introverted person and I didn\u2019t know many people coming into my first year. That said, all of my closest friends right now (who I\u2019ve been friends with from first year) I only met when we actually got on campus. I\u2019ll admit, from the wave of Yalies I became mutuals with on Instagram right after decision day, I connected with people and thought we would be really good friends when we finally got to campus. But in reality, the people I consider my best friends are people I met once I got here. \n\nYou meet SO many people through your FroCo group, residential college, PL groups if applicable, pre-orientation programs\u2014all before you even go to your first class, where it\u2019s also super easy to make a friend by asking to study sometime. The amount of people you know going into your first semester doesn\u2019t fully determine the people you\u2019ll surround yourself with once you\u2019re here! I promise you will be okay and hopefully love it here as much as I do.",

I was one of them, and can assure you those groups are a majority. From what I can tell, it seems like basically no one makes their main friends at BDD - those friends are formed once you actually enroll, at orientation etc. I would try not to worry too much lol.",

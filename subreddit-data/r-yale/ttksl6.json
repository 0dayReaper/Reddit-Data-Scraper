    "postText": "I was wondering what the people on the campus are like and how they get together. I know that the school is more liberal arts focused, though the sciences are still good, especially bio. I know that the school would be academically stimulating. But I was wondering about how life on campus looks like and feels like. I do plan to visit, but for now I just kind of want to get a sense of what I should be prepared for.\nThanks!",

            "comment": "vibrant! The students are full of enthusiasm for what they do and energy. It\u2019s a bustling, busy campus, in terms of academics, extracurriculars, and social life. I found it easy to make friends especially at the start of freshman year. New Haven is a small city but a city nonetheless with plenty to do in terms of food, bars, concerts, museums, outdoor activities, you name it - but the center of campus life is definitely on-campus not out in the city. Extracurricular events, residential college parties, and (for a certain crowd, especially amongst freshmen) frat and sports house parties are the main social life. But this is a very diverse group of activities and there\u2019s pretty much any type of social life you are looking for. If you are an excited, energetic person about pretty much anything, you will fit in well. I am a late \u201810s grad so I have a pre COVID perspective. Feel free to DM with more questions!",

If you want to move outside of your comfort zone and try new things, you can do that too. A lot of club sports are open to people who don't have a history with the sport and they welcome new people. You can find something to do every night if you want or you can find a study group committed 100% to spending their Friday/Saturday evening in the library.  \n\n\nIt was much more chill than we anticipated though there are plenty of people who are super intense and equally those who are there to take advantage of every party.",

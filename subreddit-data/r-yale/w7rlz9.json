    "postText": "Apologies if this is against any rules of this sub. \n\nLooking for a fourth roommate for a four-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment. 1-year lease starting in August 2022. Rent is around 1000. The apartment is on the second and third floor of a house on Compton and Winchester (10 mins from SOM and the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, 15 mins from old campus). It's fully furnished, fully equipped, washer/ dryer in unit, spacious, clean, with a shared backyard and porch. The three of us will be graduate students at Yale and would strongly prefer living with another student.\n\nIf you're interested, feel free to DM me with a short intro and I can share more details and videos of the place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/08x3b121eqd91.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7f9db556ffc4b2620efd00c20f29ecf435df7cbb",

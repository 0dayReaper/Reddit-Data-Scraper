So just don\u2019t be afraid to be a bit more outgoing, nobody will remember if you do something weird, especially at bulldog days (think about it, do you remember any stranger that did something weird? at least i don\u2019t). But you\u2019ll definitely make friends!! i would say yale admits are some of the friendliest out of all the top schools (not an exaggeration) so don\u2019t be afraid to just randomly say hi and introduce yourself to new people!\n\nTL;DR altho there might be some cliques from students admitted from the same hs, there are so many other people looking for new friends just like you :D",

    "postText": "Sorry if this is a stupid question but .. what is the purpose of placing into higher classes? I'm currently questioning whether to take the math placement test to skip Math 112 / 115 (Precalculus), but I am a little weak on some material and would rather re-take the class to gain a stronger foundation. \n\nThe problem is ... I want to double major (potentially in mathematics/philosophy &amp; EPE), and was wondering if placing into a higher class would allow me to double-major more easily because I take less courses for my degree? Is that how it works?\n\nIf someone could list the benefits of placing into a higher class besides skipping repeated materials, that would be great!",

            "comment": "if you need to take course X because it is listed as a major requirement, then skipping course X does not help reduce your workload. they typically want you to take another course to maintain the overall number of courses towards the major.\n\nif you need to take course X because a course Y you want/need to take lists course X as a prereq, then except for introductory math and gen chem, most prereqs are not enforced. sometimes professors know that students will not survive course Y without course X and will enforce it, but I have only seen this happen twice (and even then the professor still let me skip one prereq)\n\nso then some of the reasons you might skip course X are (1) you do not really care about that course, just the ones they open you up to do, (2) sometimes the harder courses reteach important parts of the classes before, and if you are a fast learner you can save yourself room for a different class, and (3) you want to get to the most rigorous high-brow classes as fast as possible\n\nsome people actually intentionally take easier classes (that they might have already learned) to secure an A",

            "comment": "Yeah I actually took calc bc in high school, placed into math 120, and decided to take math 115 bc I\u2019m premed and knew I\u2019d only need to take up to calc 2 for med schools (and also knew I would likely be able to secure an A in a class that was basically just review of content from high school). Placing out of lower level classes just means you can take \u201charder\u201d / upper level classes sooner \u2014 yale really doesn\u2019t let you graduate early. If you\u2019re thinking of math and/or epe, just take the placement test to see what you get placed into. Even if you get placed into math 120, it doesn\u2019t stop you from taking 115 (calc 2) or even 112 (calc 1). However, if you do place into 120 and are considering math, it\u2019ll allow you to start major reqs sooner. I\u2019ve heard from lots of friends that 115 and 120 really don\u2019t have much overlap (other than parametrics and just basic integral-solving skills), so you probs are fine to take 120 if you place into it and are comfortable with those skills. If not, 112 and 115 are literal reviews of high school AP calc curricula, so you\u2019d be safe taking either of those",

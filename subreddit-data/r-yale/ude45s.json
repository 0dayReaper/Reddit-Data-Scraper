            "comment": "I did Yale engineering not so long ago. I was an environmental engineering major for about a year but I ultimately switched to a different engineering major. I had an excellent experience and am so glad I went where I did. Environmental engineering at Yale is decent: the department is small which has its pros (small classes, easier to navigate, meet faculty) and cons (fewer opportunities/course options). Few engineering students from Yale go on to be engineers, but the quantitative major, like you said, is useful on a resume. Engineering at Yale is not competitive and is academically more flexible than most schools in terms of coursework. There is a student maker space (the CEID) that also functions as a study space, social space, and free crafting/tool shop that I LOVED going to. I was also deciding between Harvard and MIT but I am so glad I chose Yale. I think my undergrad experience was chiller academically and gave me the space to grow extracurricularly and socially which is what I really needed. Both the Yale name and the Stanford name will get you far so it\u2019s really just a matter of where gives you a better vibe.",

The stereotype I have of them is that their programs are rigorous, cost of living is out of this world, but that they do have many intelligent faculty and students. Whichever school you choose, you\u2019ll probably have complaints about it down the road. I do think Stanford engineering has more prestige associated with them but Yale and Stanford are both top tier schools. What do you like about Yale? Sometimes we\u2019re just more drawn to choices that don\u2019t seem like the better choice from an objective view. If there\u2019s not much of a value difference between two choices, just choose what excites you more. What you make of that choice is what matters anyway. I would, however, look into which school offers more resources on preparing for the career path you want to go into.",

I am a current chemE student with so much direct involvement in the envE side of the department, and it is well-established to be exceptional given its size (graduate program ranked 9th for 6 (now 7) full time faculty members). yale envE has a unique take on environmental engineering that few other schools share: they are chemical engineering at the core, but with strong environmental topical focus. yale does not have civil engineering, so it does not mean that you are building bridges. if, however, you are interested in water-air quality solutions, yale has some of the cutting-edge research for these topics. undergraduate research with yale faculty is so easy, and will get even easier given the incoming faculty member's curricular plans.",

I don't think there's a meaningful difference in the  major between the two schools. I can't say much about Stanford, but I feel strongly that the community of Yale is it's biggest strength. I've found it to be be a very environment, and I think that that are a lot of cool things that help to make the undergrad experience enjoyable alongside merely being productive. Also, the school of forestry and environmental stories building is really well designed and right next to Steep.",

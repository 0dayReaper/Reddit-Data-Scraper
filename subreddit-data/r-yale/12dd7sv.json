    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m an incoming grad student, and I\u2019m moving from overseas so I\u2019m thinking of trying to move into a furnished dorm. Has anyone here lived in one of the Prospect St houses? Did you like it? I\u2019m interested in 254, but on the photos I can\u2019t tell if it looks lived in and cozy or just a little run-down. \n\nI\u2019m also interested in ES Harkness Hall, since it looks a little more modern, but I\u2019m worried about sharing bathrooms and showers with the entire floor. \n\nPlease let me know your dorm experiences! Which buildings would you stay away from and which ones can you recommend?\nThanks &lt;3",

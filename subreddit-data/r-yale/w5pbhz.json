I heard that some ivy league schools have grants that can help with living expenses does Yale have that? Do I have to apply, get accepted and wiat to see what financial aid I qualify for?",

If you\u2019re doing a master\u2019s, you will likely have some expenses as there is minimal financial aid for these programs. Most funding will be from\nOutside Yale like the NSF which has funding for master degrees",

            "comment": "Many of the PhD and even MA programs at Yale will offer full tuition remission and a stipend which can be very generous compared to other schools of the same caliber without massive endowments.\n\nWithout knowing the divinity school much, and especially since it is sort of its own entity, the best bet would be to get in touch with a registrar and ask about how students typically fund their studies there. Ask about tuition remission, stipends, and if not those, then grants, scholarships and other things that can be offered upon admission. They'll be really frank with you, I bet, since its a worry of many students.\n\nFor what its worth, I did my MA here in a relatively niche but well funded field, and was fully funded with stipend for my two years.",

That's part of their job. \n\nHonestly, if you're a bit uncomfortable asking about money, the honest atmosphere of the program, and other more candid questions, you can ask the registrar to put you in touch with a current student who would be willing to speak with you. \n\nA step further would be getting in touch with a professor, maybe the chair, a professor who's work is interesting to you, or someone else listed on their website--this depending on the size of the exact program you're interested in.\n\nIn my experience, professors and students alike are 1) glad to tell you about their experience, and 2) glad to be in touch with people doing their full research about the program. \n\nAlso, on a personal note, I think it's great that you're doing so much research ahead of time. I went to CC and barely thought about grad school during that time, it was just about getting to university. Grad school materialized later. If you're getting worried about grad school, my best advice to you would be to focus on university actually haha. To get into graduate school, you need solid letters of recommendation, and a decent body of work, that you can probably pull an essay from. Maybe a publication in a student journal would be good too. So, kudos, but take it one step at a time, and be open to the possibility that you might not want to go to grad school in two or three years!\n\nSorry for the unsolicited advice...but good luck.",

I live in NYC atm and plan to move to East Rock. \n\nI\u2019m hoping to meet people outside my program - how feasible is this? I went to Gryphon\u2019s during my last campus visit - is that actually a good spot?\n\nAny info or words of advice is much appreciated.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m finishing up my last year right now, so I can give you my take on things. I moved from NYC to East Rock  to start my PhD in 2018. I\u2019ll be honest, I was worried that I would hate living in New Haven coming from NY, but I ended up being happier than I expected. \n\nAs far as making friends outside of your program, you definitely should be able to. Some places I know that I/my cohort mates have made friends: class, pick-up sports - both through intramural leagues and casual games at Payne Whitney, the bike co-op, church, MacDougal events, the CEID (center for engineering innovation &amp; design)\u2026 Like anywhere, you just need to be willing to put yourself out there. \n\nI don\u2019t really have any insights into Gryphon\u2019s; it\u2019s not really a common hangout place for people in my program. But I\u2019ve met current and former students who have good things to say, so if you liked it while you there, it\u2019s probably worth going again. \n\nDating is about what you\u2019d expect it to be, I\u2019d say. Everyone I know here who started dating someone in grad school met them online. The pool of people on apps like Hinge and Tinder is obviously going to be significantly smaller than in NYC and has a lot of Yale-affiliated people. \n\nThat\u2019s my two cents. If you have any other questions or want neighborhood recommendations, let me know!",

The professional schools tend to be quite insular so in my experience it can take a bit more effort to branch out, but it\u2019s doable.\n\nI\u2019d second the other comment that joining activities and groups you\u2019re interested in is probably the best way. Outside of my program I\u2019ve met friends through participating in one of the Yale choirs, some dual undergrad/grad clubs and activities, and volunteering outside of Yale (where I\u2019ve met both Yalies and other young folk around New Haven). Some of my friends have met other grad students through theater, dance shows, research or working groups, or by taking classes in other schools and programs. Best of luck!",

However, this was within a week or two before decisions were set to release.\n\nB) Sometimes, said documents contained a Yale student ID- which are for matriculated students. From what I heard there, everyone who got one got accepted.\n\nC) Finally, some students were able to find said SID by emailing the financial aid office and asking for it.\n\nHowever, since we didn\u2019t have a SID yet, + the fact that decisions are still a month away, don\u2019t take it as much yet. But I agree, at the very least it\u2019s not *bad* news, so you likely at least haven\u2019t been rejected *yet*.",

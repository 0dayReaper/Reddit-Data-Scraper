            "comment": "If you feel comfortable with coding, I'd recommend jumping right into CS 201 (intro to comp sci) or CS 223 (data structures). I'd also get discrete math out of the way as it's a pre-req for algorithms. Moving forward you can take CS 323 (systems) and CS 365 (algorithms) in any order, just make sure to surround 323 with relatively easier classes when you do take it b/c the workload is high. Fill the rest of your schedule out with interesting electives and you should be good to go!",

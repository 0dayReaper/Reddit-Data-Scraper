    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m a recent Yale Class of 2027 admit and was interested in attending Bulldog Day on April 24-26. I also got admitted into Harvard Class of 2027 and wanted to go to Harvard Vistas on April 23-24 as well. I\u2019m from Texas and interested in concentrating in government/political science.\n\nI was planning on making my final decision between the two schools after going to Bulldog Day and Visitas. I\u2019m flying alone from Texas into Boston and wanted to plan out logistics for getting from Harvard to Yale (whether that is by bus or train). If there\u2019s anyone else who is planning on going to both please PM me as I want to create a group chat to go together from Harvard to Yale.\n\nI'd also like any advice possible in making my decision - some categories I care about are location, transport, extracurricular access and competitiveness, undergraduate opportunities/support, and vibe, but any advice is helpful!",

Between these I would advise going for 174 to be with other first-years and make some friends within your major that will be with you for all four years.\n\n332/333 is physical chemistry. I wouldn't recommend starting here but it's definitely not unheard of. Pchem is usually taken by sophomores and juniors. The most typical path would be orgo (1st year) -&gt; pchem (2nd year) + inorganic (2nd/3rd year) -&gt; advanced lectures and labs.",

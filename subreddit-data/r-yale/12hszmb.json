I have some competing graduate school offers that I need to respond to soon, so I'm curious to know if we'll hear back from PREP before those deadlines to respond. Grateful for any info!",

I emailed the director and she said they will reach out to potential candidates for interviews starting April 11th (today) and will conduct the interviews the week of the 16th. Offers will go out shortly after - so end of April-ish? \n\nI haven\u2019t gotten an email yet regarding interviews, though. Any luck?",

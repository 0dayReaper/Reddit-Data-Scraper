MS in Computer Science\n\nHow should I help here in preparing the SOP, and the Profile as a whole so that we can have a chance for getting admitted into the Program? \n\nShe has around 3 years+ Work Experience in Accenture as a Software Engineer and is promoted twice in this Span.\n\nThank you, please reach out to me if you need additional details!",

I mean there is no minimum requirement at Yale but a score of 98 would often times not even allow you to study abroad (undergrad) at universities within the US. I know she\u2019s not a PhD student, but the GSAS website subtly suggests that a score of at least 25 is preferred in each TOEFL section: https://gsas.yale.edu/what-minimum-required-toefl-or-ielts-score",

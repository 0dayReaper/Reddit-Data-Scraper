The bells weren\u2019t as bad as I thought. Most times I wasn\u2019t in my room at the time or couldn\u2019t hear them over my fan. I was lucky enough to get a single with a closet and I think that made a huge difference. I love the community within Branford and the dining hall/food grew on me too. It was also cool to watch the courtyards change throughout all 4 seasons. Feel free to ask me any other questions!!",

It will be loudest in Branford, and for some people it\u2019s very disruptive/distracting. I like the bells, so being nearby in saybrook is lovely, but I know a lot of people get tired of them.",

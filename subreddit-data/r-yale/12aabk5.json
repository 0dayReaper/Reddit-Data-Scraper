            "comment": "Pros: \n\n* If you're capable and eager, you will learn a *lot* from your classes. There are a lot of cool phenomena that are beyond the scope of a one semester biochemistry class that you'll learn about, but more importantly you'll learn how they were discovered. They really try to teach scientific thinking rather than just memorization. As to whether that's successful for most people, look to the cons.\n* There are a ton of research opportunities. This is true for pretty much any field at any university of a similar caliber, but even just cold emails can get you a long way.\n* There are really nice opportunities post-gradif you're a top performer. Yale isn't really known for being a STEM school, which makes it somewhat easier to stand out (I wouldn't say this is true for MCDB, but a lot of people are scared off from MB&amp;B). Small sample size, but Yale is very well represented at my company (which pays new grads better than finance/big tech/almost anything else. Tons of people also go to top med schools/grad programs.\n\nCons: \n\n* Some of the classes are very hard, not well taught, or both. To be fair, scientific reasoning isn't something that's easy to teach, but there have been some other classes I think I got very little out of.\n* There's a bit of nepotism in the fellowships at Yale, for better or for worse. If you know the professors who run the programs (and they think you're capable), it's a lot easier to get fellowships and such.\n* Somewhat snakey/competitive - never experienced this myself but have heard complaints about this in the harder classes.\n* Somewhat low support for students - it's a smaller major, and pretty self-selecting in terms of people who choose to major in it. Though there are resources available such as peer tutors, they're incomparable to the resources available in the CS department for example, so it can be hard if you're struggling.",

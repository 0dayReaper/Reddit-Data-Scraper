    "postText": "I am so exhausted. Not from my workload, that isn't even too bad. It's just the environment and people.\n\nI don't even know how to describe it. It's not that the people here are mean - they aren't. It's just I wish people here weren't ALWAYS on. I'm tired of it. You can always tell people are comparing themselves to you in every conversation. No one has time to hangout because they're always busy. \"What are you doing next summer\" has come up like 50 times already this year. Some people just \"befriend\" you to expand their future network.\n\nI just visited my friend at a less intense (but still great) school and the people there just seemed so much more relaxed and happy. Two years ago I couldn't wait to be surrounded by super motivated people, but now I realize how emotionally draining it is.",

It is not the experience I had at Yale, though it definitely reminds me of what hanging out with Harvard and Penn kids was like (especially Wharton kids). I would suggest hanging out with different people. Seriously - it will change your Yale experience",

I haven't really been exposed to anything like that yet; I can think of maybe one dude who I thought was actually comparing himself to me in a competitive/toxic way. Maybe you're hanging out with the wrong people, or maybe it's your field in particular, but personally I've praised Yale in conversations with friends at similarly prestigious schools because I've always felt people here are self-driven and non-competitive.

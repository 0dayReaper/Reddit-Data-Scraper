Since it just doubled I'm sure we could find space to tuck a tiny one that wouldn't have to be defended heavily in there somewhere! I've drafted a 13x13 one we could possibly use but I'm not at all an artist so if you're interested please try and come up with your own!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cmon0t0o9dr81.png?width=1064&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=430222717bea45bd6593071e1858c864b9934c11",

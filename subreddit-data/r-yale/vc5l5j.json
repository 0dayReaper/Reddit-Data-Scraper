In my program they prioritized second &amp; third year students for these positions, but still occasionally had a first year if they had high enrollment. I\u2019d reach out ASAP as they\u2019ll probably start filling these positions soon!",

For example, in Japanese you meet with your tutor once a week for conversation practice and keeping fresh, etc. I don't know how hiring works, but emailing a professor would be a good start!\n\nIf you are a native speaker of a language that is relatively rare, or not taught on campus, there's another program that connects researchers/students with those people, although I'm forgetting the name right now...that's a bit different and I don't know how it works!",

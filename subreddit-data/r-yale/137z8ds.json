My group consisted of roughly 15 girls and we went to a free diaper distribution center (Diaper Bank of CT) and packed diapers into boxes to be distributed for three days. My group really enjoyed it and we were fortunate enough to be provided with air conditioning the entire time haha.",

            "comment": "- LAUNCH, MUSEUMS, and RESERVED are all brand new, so no real opinion there. However, I do love Tsai City.\n- BUILD was piloted last year, so they got a lot of cool things like a trip to New York. Probably not as reflective of the fully-fledged program.\n- FOCUS was a disaster last year. That was the one I was in. Would not recommend.\n- FOOT and HARVEST are very active and outdoorsy. HARVEST might have animals, and you stay in the same place. FOOT you might be moving from place to place and won't have animals.\n- Can't comment on Cultural Connections, but have heard it is one of the best for forming a community and learning how to access resources like the cultural houses.\n- OISS is required if you are international student, and you aren't able to do it if you aren't one, so not really relevant.",

            "comment": "FOOT, Harvest, FOCUS are all old and do an amazing job providing great experiences and building community. CC and OIS are more targetted, but if you fit into who they are for, they also do great. Build, Museums, Launch, Reserve are all new(ish) and are still figuring out what they are. For the most part, they are more project based then meeting people. As a FOOT leader, I am kind of biased to viewing this time as a chance to make some really good connections before you start Yale and get out of your comfort zone to try something new.",

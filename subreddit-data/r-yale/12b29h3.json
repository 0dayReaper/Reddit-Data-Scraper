While at New Haven, I'd like to visit the major cities nearby New Haven, but, being a Texan that's driven on big open highways my whole life, I have no idea how trains/shuttles work or how much they cost, so I have no idea how accessible this idea is. Can anyone tell me how all this stuff would work? Thanks!",

            "comment": "This is one of the best things about New Haven ... of course it's a lovely city in and of itself, but the proximity and ease-of-access to everything in the DC-Boston corridor is a big selling point.\n\nAmtrak has some faster trains called \"Acela\" with reserved seats, a quiet car, etc. Those make limited stops and are good if you're in a hurry, but they aren't anywhere near \"bullet train\" speed. (Other countries would laugh at us.) Amtrak also has lots of \"regular speed\" trains that make stops in many more towns/stations between the big ones, so you can get to more places than just Boston, Providence, New York, Philly, DC. \n\nTickets for all these trains are dynamically priced, and some require reservations in advance while others you can just show up and get a ticket. It's cheaper than air travel and more convenient because you usually arrive in or near the city center.\n\nThere also are intra-city coach buses that travel various routes up and down the East Coast, they often go places where train service is more limited. (This isn't just Greyhound, there are a number of companies that focus on limited routes between key cities, have bigger/more comfortable seats and WiFi, etc.) Those are (usually) even cheaper still, but vary **widely** in quality and sometimes have safety issues with driver training etc. You'll want to ask around for which ones are the best if you choose the bus. As with the train, ticket prices and reservation requirements vary.",

(Parents split and mom moved to a small rural town, most of my friends are back in the city).\n\nNot sure if I need to supply my step dad's income, my biological dad's income, both or neither.\n\nNot sure if my step dad's income, my biological dad's income, both or neither will be used to determine needs based scholarships.  \n\nYale is one of my top choices and it's the only school that has not provided me an answer.",

            "comment": "study FAFSA &amp; CSS requirements - most importantly CSS for a school like Yale - b/c the requirements for when you do/don't include your mom/dad/stepdad finances are spelled out and will be the same for all schools that require CSS. your friends and your town aren't relevant (edit, cost of living resulting from town can be relevant). the definition of who you live with &amp; how much you live with them is relevant. based on your statement that you live with your mom/stepdad more than 50% of the time (you only live with your dad when not in school), my guess is at least both your mom and stepdad's finances are considered. your dad's might also be included but I forget the specifics since they're not relevant to our situation.\n\nagain, read/study the documents - they're pretty specific.",

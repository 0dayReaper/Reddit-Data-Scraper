    "postText": "Idk if this is the right place to ask this, but I only saw this sub and the grad program one (which doesn't really have too many people on it).\n\nFrom the outset, I'm curious about whether or not it's worth attempting to get in, as my background is probably a little out of the ordinary for most other applicants, if there even is an \"ordinary\".\n\nGraduated from UNH with criminal justice bachelors and concentration in international security with a 3.5. Then got my JD from UConn a few years later with a meh gpa (3.4). I passed the bar, but for whatever reason decided to enlist in the army in an Intel MOS. Been in for 3 years so far, and through the training got an associates in Russian from DLI (as well as a good amount of proficiency) and another associates in intelligence operations.\n\nI'm not really worried about getting recommendations, and I've always been a very good writer. My worries are with the GPAs and weird career trajectory.\n\nAlso, for context, I'm looking to get my masters to go officer through the green to gold program.\n\nEdit: because I fat-fingered my phone",

You probably should stress how your backgrounds, Russian language, military service, and other education, can contribute to your commitment to public service. GPA has been fixed; so you should focus more some other scholarly aspects, including a relatively clear research/study focus. You can check courses.yale.edu to see Jackson\u2019s course offering\u2014some on international security may fit your goal. Hope it helps.",

    "postText": "Hi! I applied REA to Yale towards the end of October, but haven't received an interview invitation yet and decisions come out on dec. 14. Is receiving an interview a good measure of whether or not you will most likely be admitted to the university? Is it appropriate for me to email the admissions office and inquire on the topic? Also, has anyone received an interview later in the review process, towards December? Thanks!",

Whether or not you get an interview is not determined by the quality of your application, but simply the alumni availability in your area. Im pretty sure interview reports are due December 1st, but not completely sure on that. Im also pretty sure that decisions come out on the 15th?\nBest of luck :)",

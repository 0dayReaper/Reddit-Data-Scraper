This is the epitome of reasonable doubt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really hope I don't live in a world where a completely unsubstantiated accusation from 30+ years ago can ruin someone's career. Am I saying she's lying? No. However, I'm not going to assume a man is guilty just based on one person's word, and I don't see how anyone else can either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConsidering the political demographics at Yale, I don't know how many of you will share my opinion.  I, for one, do not support Kavanaugh politically. To me, however, this isn't a partisan matter; it's a matter of the fundamental beliefs of our justice system. To allow this accusation to affect Kavanaugh's career is to weaponize any sexual assault accusation, even if it may be completely unsubstantiated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: To those downvoting me, I would love to hear what part of my argument you disagree with.",

            "comment": "What about her therapist's notes from 2012 and 2013 which mention the incident? Also, I don't get why so many people are hung up on Ford's inability to remember the owner and location of the house where it happened. I certainly don't remember the time, location, and ownership of every house party I've ever been to, and I can't imagine how unimportant those details would become when you're traumatized by sexual assault. Also, new allegations are emerging about Kavanaugh from his time here at Yale, so it seems like we might be establishing a pattern. \"Innocent until proven guilty\" applies to the justice system, and of course Kavanaugh isn't under arrest or anything of the sort. Surely we can tap the brakes on his confirmation until we understand this situation better, and if you look at what actual Democrats (not randos on Facebook) are saying, you'll find that all they want is time to address this before blindly confirming him for completely partisan reasons.",

Yeah okay other people were mean to you in this thread, is this your first day on the internet?\n\nYou also notably have only responded to people who generally agree with you or other low-hanging fruit, and none of the other longer, more well-thought out responses including the more important parts of the comment above:\n\n&gt;\"Innocent until proven guilty\" applies to the justice system, and of course Kavanaugh isn't under arrest or anything of the sort. Surely we can tap the brakes on his confirmation until we understand this situation better, and if you look at what actual Democrats (not randos on Facebook) are saying, you'll find that all they want is time to address this before blindly confirming him for completely partisan reasons.\n\nYou acknowledge in another comment that \"yes he should be investigated\" but mostly you just keep beating at the strawman of \"his career is about to be ruined by these accusations.\" Not being confirmed to SCOTUS and having to go back to being a federal judge is not a career ruined. Nobody is calling for Kavanaugh to be publicly drawn and quartered. \n\nThe force and urgency of those declaring that they believe Dr. Ford or stand with Dr. Ford is a response to the Senate GOP trying desperately to ram through Kavanaugh's confirmation *before these claims can be properly investigated* (especially with additional allegations from other women coming out), not a desire to see Kavanaugh being punished prior to any investigation.\n\nAs to the actual credibility of Ford's and Ramirez's claims - I do find them believable, though I agree that they are not provable beyond a reasonable doubt. When I was an undergrad, I thought much the same way you did, and sometimes had bitter conversations with other male friends about how it seemed like a false accusation, or next-morning regret following a drunken encounter, could unjustly screw you over especially with the UWC's opaque process. Hell, one of my friends and fraternity brothers was actually falsely accused and expelled because of it ([Yale recently just settled with him](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2018/01/17/yale-reaches-settlement-with-expelled-student/)).\n\nWhy do I still believe Ford and Ramirez? Why does my friend whose life was actually significantly ruined by being expelled, also still recognize that his case was in the tiny minority and the vast majority of women's sexual assault allegations have significant basis and credibility?\n\nI would suggest that you try to talk to female friends, classmates who you are close to and trust, and see if they will talk to you about their experiences. I think you would be shocked at how many episodes of harassment or outright assault just about every college-age woman has experienced.\n\nAnd then think about what incentive they would have to lie to you or make shit up. This is the part that really affected how I think about sexual assault allegations (which are so polarizing and difficult to untangle precisely because it's so hard to prove either way whether a specific allegation occurred or not). You're a smart kid - and especially if you're an econ/stats/STEM major - think about the cost-benefit for these women in voicing the allegations. Christine Ford was immediately deluged with death threats and had to move out of her house. What is far more likely - that Ford and Ramirez both just love fearing for their lives and the lives of their families by telling lies, or that Kavanaugh did drunkenly cross a line on several occasions and that his victims want people to know about what he did before he receives a lifetime appointment to the nation's highest court?\n\nEdit: if it means anything to you, Ramirez's allegation was reported by Ronan Farrow, who won a Pulitzer this year for his meticulous journalism that actually brought down the careers of Harvey Weinstein and Les Moonves. Weinstein was actually recorded by the NYPD doing his dirty deeds, but I'm curious about your thoughts on Moonves, or Matt Lauer, or Louis CK, or Mario Batali, and I guess the entire #MeToo movement at this point - **very few of these cases had any \"hard evidence\" as well** (again, as in most sexual assault cases) - do you think that all these are doubtful as well?",

Sure, it's a very important and the most visible part of this, but that's beside the point.\n\nOther questions that are a part of this are:\n\n * In what ways are victims of sexual assault / harassment systemically disincentivized from reporting? What can we do to change that?\n * How do we respond to reports of sexual assault and sexual harassment?\n * How do we treat victims of sexual assault / harassment in private? How do we treat them in public?\n\nIf you assume that at one point in time we live in a world in which victims are publicly shamed, reporting is disincentivized, and assault is swept under the rug (which we do, or at least did), and if you further assume that at another point we live in a world in which none of those are the case (which I think we can all agree is the world we want to live in), then I can't think of any way to get from point A to point B that doesn't involve some instances in which \"stale\" sexual assault is brought up against powerful people. That doesn't mean that it shouldn't be brought up, because the only way we get to point B is if it is, and if we \u2014 through that process \u2014\u00a0change how we respond to reports of sexual harassment.\n\nSo, you may argue that you want to live in a world in which this accusation against Kavanaugh is brought up in a different way (for example, maybe you want it to be brought up in a more timely manner). I wouldn't disagree. But we don't live in that world; we live in a transitional world, and if we want to continue the transition in that direction, I think we need to concede that the transition will be messy \u2014 because the only way to avoid messiness is to maintain the structure in which one party is automatically silenced, and one party is automatically exonerated.",

If we are going to investigate ANY claim, in the current political environment, NO ONE will ever get confirmed as a Justice from this point forward. Neither party gives a shit about the country anymore, it's just partisan bullshit, and they'll do anything to win. You could nominate the Dalai Lama, and the opposing party will find SOMEONE who will claim they were sexually assaulted by His Holiness!",

The point is that everything has changed with regards to, even accusations of, sexual impropriety. Accusations of sexual impropriety can now be effectively weaponized if one chooses to; this has always been the case, but not as much as it is now. You don't find it strange that we've gotten this far in the process, and all of a sudden, when the Dems are at the inevitable end, two women pop up with accusations? The Anita Hill issue had MUCH more evidence i.e. eyewitnesses. The evidence in Kavanaugh's case is scant at best. I highly doubt that the Bar considers mere accusations as evidence for \"appearance of impropriety\". ",

Senator Feinstein is being critiqued for not making this info known earlier (though I\u2019m not sure what she could have done given the victim\u2019s request). But IIRC, she sent the letter back in July, as the Kavanaugh confirmation process was beginning. What is supposed to be suspicious about that?\n\nIf I had to guess, the victim may have not wanted to go public at all, other than to tell her Representative and Senator that she thinks Kavanaugh should be opposed given her personal experience. Perhaps she hoped Kavanaugh would lose the confirmation for some other reason, which would spare her from having to go public as a victim. I guess that would mean she\u2019d be relieved as long as Kavanaugh didn\u2019t make it to SCOTUS. That doesn\u2019t make her claim a political stunt; it reflects the reality of how helpless and stigmatized the victims feel.\n\nLook at how long it took for the Catholic Church, Penn State, and Larry Nassar victims took to come forward even though those cases involved much less ambiguous situations (e.g. child rape) and even had witnesses. If Ford really experienced what she did \u2014 an attempted rape in a closed room \u2014 I don\u2019t blame her for being skeptical that anyone would believe her, now or then.",

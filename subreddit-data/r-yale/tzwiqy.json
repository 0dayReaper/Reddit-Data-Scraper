            "comment": "Certainly, if your parents are in any socioeconomic class below upper middle class -- you should be eligible for full financial aid in that case. Many people worry that they can't afford to pay for an Ivy League education, but colleges like Yale are some of the few that are totally free for less affluent students.\n\nIt's trickier, although not impossible, if your parents are rich, because Yale will expect them to contribute financially.\n\nIt's worth noting that students at Yale have many opportunities available to them that are very uncommon. Most students here select opportunities that they find the most academically enriching and fun, but a student who is determined to become financially independent can pretty quickly start getting internships in finance if they play their cards right. (Again, I don't necessarily recommend this, but it is a possibility if you're willing to work hard).",

Thank you for letting me know, there\u2019s that reassurance for my fin aid award letter! \n\nFoolishly, I had not mentioned in my original post that by support, I was referring to them agreeing with the idea of me going to Yale. They think I shouldn\u2019t go because it is culturally unacceptable for a woman to leave home, even for educational opportunities of any sort!! It\u2019s heartbreaking",

There may be resources to help you make the transition to college if your parents are non-supportive or even undermining. Good luck! It\u2019s absolutely worth the trouble. The alumni community may also be able to be helpful, admissions might be able to help connect you with that as well.",

There\u2019s also safety net which can help pay for winter clothes if you come from warmer climates, and a few other resources for low income students.",

During school breaks during the year you can stay in college room dorm (I did) or go stay with local friends. Many international students did not leave either so there are lots of reasons for people not going home-while I felt sad sometimes, my Yale friends helped me and able to rent my own place and make a little money outside school time.",

The university needs those to calculate the aid it gives, at least initially. Best advice is to contact the university and share you circumstances as soon as possible to get the support you need.",

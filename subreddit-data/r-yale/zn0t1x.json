    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm happy to announce that I got accepted into Yale today (go bulldogs!) It's my dream school and seeing all the bulldogs do a little jig when I opened the letter was ... surreal. I'm still in shock and listening to my hype music playlist. \n\nHowever, I have to admit that I do have some concerns. While I'm super grateful to be accepted into the Yale community, as a first-gen daughter of two immigrants.. I can't help but feel like a fraud. Yale has always seen so ... \"high-brow,\" and now that I've been accepted, it genuinely feels... disilluioning? \n\nI mean -- I'm not a genius or anything. And while I know Yale isn't full of geniuses, I'm scared I might fall behind in my classes because everyone else is so S-M-A-R-T. \n\nAlso, there's a money issue to all this. My parents are both blue-collar workers and we've struggled with finances in the past. I attend a wealthy semi-competitive public HS currently, but even there, I feel out of place because everyone drives nice cars and all their parents have shiny degrees. Ick. \n\nLastly, I'm scared of moving across the country. I live in California, and I'm a very family-oriented person. I love my siblings, my dog, and my parents. I'm going to miss them so much.. and I feel so unready to lose them. \n\nAre my concerns justified? Again, I'm soooo happy to be accepted and I love everything about Yale: the residential colleges, the people, the vibe, the campus, the curriculum, the small classes, even the color (sexy navy blue) but these are some honest concerns I have. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Hey! Reading this is a bit crazy because this is literally more or less what I experienced. All I can say is that you belong here, the first Gen community is so welcoming, I know a lot of people who understand how it\u2019s like. I\u2019m an immigrant and I\u2019ve found my group here, yes I did feel that I had to go the extra mile and study more or sacrifice a bit more.. but there are so many resources here! Also, I\u2019m from Cali too. I miss my family and it\u2019s very tough, but they\u2019re so happy for me and I always look forward to going back home, I feel like I\u2019ve learned to appreciate Cali more. And the east coast is pretty cool! Haha anyway, I\u2019m here if you want to talk :)",

            "comment": "Fellow Californian Yalie here! I got my BA in 2000, taught undergrads for several years as a grad student (PhD 2008), and keep in touch with former faculty mentors and friends who have now joined the faculty themselves, so I've seen a lot over the past 25(!) years. I wasn't first gen, so my experience was different in some ways than yours will be, but I wanted to offer a few thoughts for what they're worth.\n\nI've only realized in the past few years that I was a more impressive applicant than I thought at the time. I look back now on things I achieved in high school that didn't seem so impressive when everyone was scrambling to build their college applications, and realize that actually they were impressive, or that it was impressive that I as a teenaged girl managed to navigate those contexts and do as much as I did, even if what I did in itself didn't strike me as impressive at the time. So have some faith in the admissions committee. Remember that they read literally thousands of applications every year, and that they've been doing this for years, and that some very experienced people looked at your application and saw abilities and accomplishments and potential that made you stand out, even if you can't see them from your perspective. I can tell you that in all my time as a student, TA, and instructor, I never came across anyone who struck me as an admissions mistake.\n\nEVERYONE, I promise, goes through a bout of impostor syndrome. And everyone feels homesick. These things are completely normal, and they speak well of you! They say that you're a loving person with strong and healthy ties to your family, and that you aren't arrogant or suffering from an inflated ego. These are all good traits to have as you transition into a new phase of your life and start building a new community for yourself. So live your feelings, but draw confidence from them too.\n\nYou'll quickly discover that everyone is worried about how much harder they're going to have to work to keep up with their classes. The two best things you can do are 1) reach out to friendly people in your classes to set up study groups, or reach out to your suitemates and friends to set up study hours and 2) be mindful about learning how to learn, and about time management. Think about what works best for you, in terms of note-taking and study methods or scheduling yourself to make best use of your most productive hours. You could even Google a bit to learn more about study skills if you're really worried. (But most people will not have done that!!)\n\nFinally, the money issue. Yes, there are some seriously rich people at Yale. You will see some expensive clothes and hear about some pretty amazing trips. But you will also meet some seriously rich (and accomplished) people who don't make a big deal of their wealth or who actively try to downplay it, because they understand that other things matter much more. There is also a growing and increasingly visible first-gen community at Yale. And there are a lot of people like me, who are just middle class, who don't come from money. If someone ever makes you feel uncomfortable because of their wealth or privilege, have the confidence to walk away and know that there are many people there who share your values, even if they don't share all aspects of your background.\n\nCONGRATULATIONS, and good luck!",

    "postText": "I am a first year, the semester just started, and I genuinely cannot wait for it to end. I don't know what\u2019s my problem, but I know I tried. I go to club meetings/events and even formed study groups for some of my classes. Still, after the meeting/study session is done, it seems like I\u2019ve never met those people in my life. In high school, this wasn\u2019t a problem. I went to a very small school and it was easy to make friends and interact with people. But here at Yale, I am inherently unable to form any bonds. I have some good acquaintances, but that\u2019s it. I feel like not having anyone to talk, study, grab a meal, or hug makes my Yale experience so much harder. I thought that this semester would be better, but now I have two on-campus jobs (I need to) while doing research and  taking five classes, so trying to have a social life / meet people is even harder now. And on top of that, at this point, most first years already have a group, and I know that the friends you make during your first year are crucial to your later experience. Despite this situation, I have friends at home with who I am really connected, and I am trying to remind myself that I have my people at home. Honestly, any advice is appreciated.",

I was a Philosophy of Religion student at the Div school, so my experience was probably a bit different than an undergraduate experience, but I found that by spending time at the refectory at the Div school, I was able to meet some fantastic people. \n\nIf you are ever lonely, and you are looking for a place to eat lunch, I\u2019d recommend the divinity school refectory. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever found another place with so many friendly people all together at once.",

I did get lucky and found a group of friends I can count on but even now as a junior it does sometime suck not having others either. Probably not giving much reassurance with this comment, but def just keep chugging along. I know I clicked best w/ FGLI students and whatnot, so think about your background too. Lot of kids coming from private schools so it\u2019s a culture shift",

            "comment": "There are a few things I\u2019d suggest here, but I want to take a moment to say that I\u2019m sorry this has been your experience. I also want to emphasize that as a former FroCo, I know that many first-years, even ones who seemingly have a group, share this feeling of unbelonging that undoubtedly persists in this transition to college, as much as Yale\u2019s structures make an effort to mitigate it.\n\nNow, my suggestions. These may be difficult to implement for someone who feels lonely, but I was in similar shoes my first year at Yale, only for me to become desperate to become a FroCo to share some wisdom with first-years similar to me.\n\n1. Go to FroCo duty nights, even for FroCos who are not your own. Even if you don\u2019t necessarily make friends at them, it\u2019s a way to assuage the loneliness with FroCos who genuinely care about you and your emotional well-being. You\u2019ll get food, do activities, and just chat with people. If you meet the other FroCos, it also gives you a broader support network and more friendly faces.\n\n2. Keep working your on-campus jobs, but try to apply to ones that help you connect to communities. College aides; research positions; and admissions jobs might fulfill these roles. \n\n3. The hard part about making friends is reaching out. Study groups are a great first step, but you have to make overtures to people to say, \u201cHey, can we grab a meal on Monday night?\u201d I\u2019m naturally introverted, and this was the hardest lesson of my first-year was swallowing my pride and asking people to grab a meal.",

If not, it\u2019s a big world and New Haven is a big enough city to find friends. \n\nConsider befriending people of other ages and possibly outside of school or at least outside Yale College. \n\nGo to the public library, or to church or temple, even if you aren\u2019t religious. Go to grad school events or campus concerts, cabaret, museums\u2026\n\nLet go of the idea that your friendships must be a certain way or a specific number or intensity. \n\nBe friendly with yourself, and kind with others, without expectations, and you\u2019ll find that people will gravitate to you naturally. \n\nMost importantly, BE a friend, instead of seeking to have a friend.",

I'm technically in a seminar, but the class is almost 25 people and my professor isn't really making a huge effort to learn names/faces. I completely understand, and I try to participate in class, but I still think I'm getting \"lost in the sauce\" and so I wanted to just meet with him to sort of introduce myself in a less formal way. The thing is, this prof doesn't have set office hours (you have to schedule them) so I was just wondering if anyone had any tips on how I should go about wording an email asking to meet?",

They probably wouldn\u2019t be too appreciative if you schedule a block of their time only to have nothing to talk about",

If you can manage to bring up one of those sources, it's more likely their shared enthusiasm for the material will bubble forth.",

Or be curious and try to think of specific questions you might have about it :) meeting w profs at office hours is definitely the most valuable thing I did during undergrad!!",

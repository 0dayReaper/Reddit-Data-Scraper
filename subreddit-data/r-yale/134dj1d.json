    "postText": "I will be visiting later this year. May have to go between main campus and West campus. Are the shuttles reliable and free for use? How long do they typically take? My google maps says it takes an hour, which seems very long. \n\nAirbnb options are super sparse/sketchy near West campus too, so I figured it would be easier to just bus in from New Haven area. Any other recommendations would be great, like any specific neighborhoods to avoid, et cetera. Unfortunately I won't have a car.",

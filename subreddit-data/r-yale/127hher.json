If you don't own one, you can always buy one here - any warm down jacket works, I just bought one from Uniqlo lol.\n\nBeyond that - make sure to bring formal clothing ('ore than u think ud need). In terms of large items - fridges, freezers, couches - discuss with ur suitemates. As an intl, it's probably easier to get them to buy it and for u to pay in. Generally, you shouldn't be bringing anything that is easy to get here and/or cheap. Duvets, lamps, etc - get that shit here.\n\nGenerally the advice from u/Benatarsimp is good. Only thing I'd add is snacks and food from ur home !! Food helps so much with home sickness, and u always get weird cravings for lots of things from home :)",

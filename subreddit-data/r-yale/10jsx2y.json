Getting one doesn't mean you are more likely to get in...not getting one doesn't mean you're less likely to get in. A lot of the interview process has to do with the sheer number of applicants and the number of volunteers conducting interviews. If you get a request, TAKE IT and RSVP ASAP. If you don't get an interview, it's okay.",

If anything, they just want to know more about you than they already do. You might consider doing both interviews. Otherwise just contact your other interview and explain.",

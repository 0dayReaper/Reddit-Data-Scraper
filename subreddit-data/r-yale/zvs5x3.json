Shapiro has a really strong grasp on political science and the research on important historical topics such as apartheid in South Africa and more recently on business relations between Israel and Palestine. It\u2019s taught in partnership with Mushfiq Mobarak, an expert on innovative economic methods for helping developing economies",

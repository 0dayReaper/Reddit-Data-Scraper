            "comment": "Hi OP - I took the long way into consulting so I can\u2019t speak to the resources at Yale. I was a Biomedical Engineering undergrad. I was premed but worked in a lab after college and decided to go into business after that. I did a masters in engineering management (colloquially known as an MBA-lite for engineers) and then went into strategy consulting after. I only do life sciences. There\u2019s a ton of public health graduates in my field.\n\nWith consulting I think the field of study is less important. In my experience, internship experience was way more important. I have worked with colleagues who majored in everything from biology, to history, to English lit\u2026 I\u2019ve always thought of consulting as extended college. Projects are typically short term, and you learn a ton over the course of the project, and then you move on to something else. Kind of like taking classes in college iykwim. It is more important to demonstrate you have the skills to succeed in the industry hence internships. \n\nWhen I started, 60 hours per week was standard. But consulting is cyclical and during crunch times it could get up to 70-80 hours per week and there were times especially in the summer where I barely cracked 30 hours per week.  But that was nice. Working for a small firm meant we got \u201csummer Fridays\u201d - if your work was done (your manager signed off on it) and you didn\u2019t have meetings then you didn\u2019t need to show up on Friday. \n\nI started in a firm in Boston and industry standard was $70k for an entry level analyst. That was about ten years ago. I chose a firm with limited travel because I didn\u2019t want to live out of a suitcase. Friends who worked for the bigger firms made more than I did but they also travelled Monday-Thursday most weeks. I had better work-life balance which was important to me. I also got a lot of responsibility earlier on. I was managing smaller engagements (&lt;4 week timeline, &lt;40k budget) by the end of my first year with the firm.\n\nThe other benefit of a smaller firm is I was able to move to Vermont after a couple of years and work remotely. I did have to commute to Boston a couple of times a month but it was doable. A lot more people are working remotely now post pandemic so that may be less of a perk.\n\nAnyway long story short, don\u2019t sweat your major. If you have time to try for a(n) (paid) internship do that, it\u2019ll also give you an idea of what the work is like and whether you really want to do it.",

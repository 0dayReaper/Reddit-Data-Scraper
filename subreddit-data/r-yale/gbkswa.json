    "postText": "Obviously you all should do whatever you want. But my unsolicited advice for you: unless you have some urgent personal reason you must start college this fall (outside scholarship that expires and can't be extended or something), take a gap year, and come in fall 2021.\n\nThere is a good chance that there won't be in-person classes in the fall. Nobody knows for sure, but it's pretty likely at this point and departments are preparing for it. Don't waste your tuition money on really overpriced webinars from Yale. Wait a year to come, and then get four full years of Yale. In addition, then you have a better chance of graduating into an economy that is one additional year away from this mess, which will probably better for your job prospects when you graduate.\n\nI know you're excited about Yale, so the idea of sitting around at home even longer sounds shitty, but if you're gonna sit around at home next fall, you might as well not have it count against your four years at Yale.",

People can develop a passion into an online business, start a project to address new social problems ignited by covid, regain their mental health after high school and before getting into more stress at college. Not saying that Yale will make it easy for everyone to defer, but apply now rather than later if you are thinking about it at all.",

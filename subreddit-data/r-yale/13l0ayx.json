    "postText": "My daughter will be a freshman this fall. She intends to major in CS+Applied Math. She self-studied AP CS A and P in her sophomore year and got 5 in both. She has some experience in Matlab later in her research project. But she did not write an extensive number of programs. \n\nI am looking at the curriculum of the Yale CS program. From what I have seen, she should be able to handle CPSC201. But I really like CS50, which covers a lot of practical skills. Is it common to take these two courses in Fall concurrently? I am considering having her take CS50, CPSC201, MATH120 and another one or two courses. Is it a feasible schedule?",

But the alternative of not learning how to take risks and handle adversity is so much worse.\n\nLet your daughter live a little now, so she can build the confidence to make decisions in the future.\n\nShe should actually be attending &gt;10 classes her first week (this is known as shopping period) and she should shop both, see how the courses feel, and then make a last-minute game-time decision from there based on the information she's gathered about the courses.\n\nShe's right at the cusp of being able to take either, so she should shop both. I would bias toward taking CPSC 201 if I was in her shoes, and then self-studying the other material because CPSC 100  teaches programming not computer science.",

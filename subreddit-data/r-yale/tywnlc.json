    "postText": "Hey, y'all! Incoming freshman here! I am going back and forth on what I want combine with a major in Statistics and Data Science. I have already ruled out Economics + Math because all of the courses I was interested in for that major can count towards S&amp;DS. Therefore, I was wondering whether y'all think EP&amp;E would put me at a disadvantage for finance recruiting? I love the combination of classes and prevalence of game theory for EP&amp;E. I also like that the male/female ratio is a lot more balanced. Plus, it gives me an excuse to take classes that I otherwise might not pick for fear of \"wasting my time.\" But, I am scared that future employers may think I am less focused on Econ. For reference, I want to work in NYC after graduation. What do y'all think?",

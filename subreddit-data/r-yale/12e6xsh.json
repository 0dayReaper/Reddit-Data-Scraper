    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am a 2023 QuestBridge Match to Yale University, 2023 Horatio Alger National Scholar, and FGLI, and I know that FYS candidates are all holistically reviewed. However, I thought with my background, I would be invited, but I am not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes this mean that I am missing out? Or should I rest assured that other support programs for FGLI exists at Yale?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

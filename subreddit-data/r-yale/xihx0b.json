            "comment": "Options in my opinion in order from best to worst. Bottom line is it's usually better to use the closer airport if you can, even if it costs more, and usually even if you have to make a connection.\n\n* HVN -&gt; Taxi to downtown. $15 with taxi (there is also a free bus but I'm not sure how to take it). 10-20 minutes.\n* BDL -&gt; Bus or taxi to CT Rail station in Hartford or Windsor Locks -&gt; CT Rail train to New Haven State Street Station. Cost about $8 with bus/train, $20-30 with taxi/train. 1.5-2 hours.\n* BDL -&gt; Taxi to New Haven. Cost about $70 to $140 with taxi. 1-1.5 hours depending on traffic.\n* Westchester Airport -&gt; Taxi to New Haven (or combined train/taxi). Cost about $60 to $150 with taxi, 1-2 hours depending on traffic (more time if you take the train). Westchester Airport occasionally has some decent flights but this will hardly ever carry any advantage over BDL. Also, the traffic can be bad at certain times of the day especially like on summer weekends.\n* LGA -&gt; bus or taxi to Harlem 125th -&gt; Metro North train to New Haven Union Station -&gt; Taxi or walk. Cost about $25-30 with bus/trains, $50-80 with taxis/trains. About 3-4 hours.\n* Airport shuttles to NYC airports, or taxis to NYC airports. You'll hit traffic, so it can take 2-3 hours if not longer, and it costs a lot more than the options above. If you are leaving at 4AM it is a better option though because there is no traffic and it can take only an hour or so to get to JFK.\n* Public transit to JFK or EWR. This just takes a long time and is a hassle, for example for JFK you take Metro North, then have to switch to an airport shuttle (and sit in traffic) or switch subway lines/Airtrain routes at least once and it involves a good walk. You can take Amtrak to EWR but it takes 2.5-3 hours, isn't known for its reliability and may cost more than most options above.  That said if you absolutely have to get to JFK/EWR because of an international flight or something, this option is similar to the airport shuttle and maybe better at certain times of day.\n* Amtrak to BOS, if you have an international flight there versus JFK it is worth considering as an option as well, but it's a longer distance.\n\nEdit: There may also be a private shuttle bus from New Haven to Bradley but I'm not familiar with it. You might not save a ton versus the taxi/rideshare.",

The airport is a few blocks off the usual route, so you have to ask the driver to stop there when you board the bus (it may help to remind the driver when you get close).  To get a pickup from the airport, you have to call CTtransit the day of your flight.  Last time, I called right when we landed and it just barely worked out; otherwise, it would have been 40 minutes until the next bus.",

Ease of flight choice into NYC is always nice, but often they'll also have a cheap connection to BDL. Security in BDL is a fraction of the time at any NYC airport too which can be non-negligible, I've had 2+ hour security lines at JFK and LGA while BDL has never been over half an hour.\n\nOthers have mentioned additional transit options that work, it just depends on how much you want to mess with public transit and the potential hassle of the timings. Ride-shares are usually fine, depending on when you're arriving/departing.",

    "postText": "Hey guys!\n\nThe mods were kind enough to let me post. My name is\u00a0Sayat Ozcan. I'm a casting producer in Los Angeles for the\u00a0*Jeopardy! National College Championship* and a proud New Englander (Watertown, MA) :) You can vet me on IG: syozcan.\n\nI'm currently casting the all-new competition featuring 15 colleges from across the country and I'd love Yale to be one of those schools. The Jeopardy! National College Championship promises to be a competition like you've never seen before. Think NCAA tournament, but Jeopardy!\n\nThe first step is taking the test, the link to which is below. You guys should set aside at least 15 minutes to complete it. We'd love for you to take it ideally by Saturday 11/21. Once you do so we'll reach out and let you know next steps if the producers choose to move you forward.\n\nI am more than happy to answer any questions for you! You can also reach me at [castingsy@gmail.com](mailto:castingsy@gmail.com)\n\n[**TAKE THE TEST**](https://www.jeopardy.com/be-on-j/national-college-championship)\n\nBest,\n\nSayat",

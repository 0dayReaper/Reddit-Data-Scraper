            "comment": "The bathrooms are communal based on floors. So you'll have 2-4 suites, totaling about 10 people, using one bathroom. No one should care if you use the bathroom in the middle of the night so long as you aren't turning on all the lights or bumping into everything. The bathroom door is right outside the suite door, so for all practical purposes it's like having one \"in your suite\" just with a very short hallway.\n\nIt's not like other schools where there is a giant hallway of dormrooms and one giant communal bathroom for everyone.\n\nFinally, some suites will have in-suite bathrooms. But again, that's not actually that much better (in particular because the custodial staff doesn't clean those so you have to do it yourself).",

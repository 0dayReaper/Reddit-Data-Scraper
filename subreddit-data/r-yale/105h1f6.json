Also would definitely make a road map to plan the double major otherwise might be hard to finish on time and without too much stress",

Probably some S&amp;DS courses as well. Remember that you can only have 2 overlaps (but prereqs for one don\u2019t count as overlaps for the other). My unsolicited opinion is that you should double in S&amp;DS instead of CS as it will give you more flexibility in selecting courses.",

That doesn't mean you will be able to take every class you want though since many classes are capped at a certain number of students and each class will have a way of narrowing down the class size if too many students show up for shopping period",

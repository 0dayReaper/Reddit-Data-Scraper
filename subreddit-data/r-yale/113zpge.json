    "postText": "i have recently received a likely letter and at first i was elated. but now i\u2019m just filled with anxiety. i come from a large kinda poor public school where getting straight a\u2019s wasn\u2019t that hard. i\u2019ve done well on standardized testing, but i don\u2019t know how well my academic experience would translate into a school with a bunch of kids that come from elite private schools that took calculus bc when they were 12. \n\nis it feasible to do well at yale for someone like me, (get a 3.7+ gpa as a premed without becoming mentally ill), or are the public school admits doomed to play a constant, losing game of catch-up?",

            "comment": "The feasibility has to do with how much work you are willing to put in. 60% of undergrads graduated from public school, so you will be in good company. The premed path anywhere is competitive and full of driven, goal-oriented students. I personally found that Yale is less cutthroat by nature than some other schools. \n\nYale is interested in YOU. They very carefully consider acceptances. They would not be pursuing you if they thought you couldn\u2019t cut it. I had the same fears when I was admitted, as I did not fit what I thought the typical Yalie mold was. I did fine! (MD eventually ha)",

You earned it just as much as the jackasses that had every advantage.\n\nThe biggest difference between success and failure for folks from non elite backgrounds is self belief. You will experience new things. Some of your classmates have seen them already. This does not mean they are better prepared or can do it better - they just got exposed earlier.\n\nNever feel sorry for yourself. Never feel like it's theirs. It's yours just as much as anybody else's.\n\nGo kick butt.",

A great thing about Yale students is that the public school attitude of detachment and \"school sucks\" is significantly muted. It's still there, but other students embrace enthusiasm. It's like dancing at a wedding: the worst dancer is the person not dancing, and the best dancer is the one who is genuinely trying, breaking out of their shell.\nYou just got to do some work, though.\n\nThere are excellent academic strategies programs for freshmen that have real practical advice about time management and what good and bad essays look like. You'll be fine.",

I often felt inadequate or just stupid because the concepts I found difficult were deemed \"simple\" or \"easy\" by my classmates. But do not get discouraged: professors at Yale reward hard work! If they see you are consistently working hard to understand the course material, you will be rewarded, even if you did not come in with the same background as someone else.",

It's pretty much equally difficult for everyone, and there's no reason not to make an A if you can really engage the material. \n\n\nExtracurricular activities are the more difficult because you won't have as much on your CV as others. Actively reach out and seek opportunities, build up your CV, figure out what everyone else is doing,  etc.",

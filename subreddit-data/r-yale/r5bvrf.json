    "postText": "Grad student here.  I'm trying to access student mental health and I am so frustrated. \n\nI'm pretty sure I'm depressed and I need medication. It will be more than a month before I can even talk to someone who is licensed to prescribe me something.  In my initial screening the guy asked me to list all my trauma and then offered me no help. I feel so overwhelmed at the process of trying to find a therapist with availability who takes the insurance and who I get along with. \n\nIt's like I have a small window where I feel well enough even to reach out for help and I need to figure this out before I fall under again.\n\nWhile dealing with my mental health stuff, I'm not feeling resilient and the system feels designed to break me. It feels intentionally difficult to discourage people from accessing care. \n\nThere are all these news stories about how Yale is adding more mental health services. Maybe they are, but all the problems are still there.\n\nAny suggestions from people who have navigated this successfully?",

Might be worth calling around to some therapists in private practice in New Haven and seeing if anyone has availability or can make referrals. I was an undergrad awhile ago and saw someone at student health for awhile but later saw a therapist off campus when I needed something longer term. \n\nI hope things will look up for you soon. If you are in an emergency situation while waiting to see someone, please call 911 or go to the ER!",

He billed on a sliding scale, so while I paid out of pocket, it was somewhat affordable and in my opinion totally worth it. Also, if you really are convinced you need meds, you can likely get those through your regular physician, although I highly recommend going through therapy first. Meds don\u2019t often work on their own.",

If you're looking for a prescription, i would call mental health and ask to speak to a provider for a temporary relief solution until your appointment, be clear that you arent in an emergency situation (unless you are) but you are feeling horrible and need something. I did this for bad anxiety and was able to get small dose benzos until i met with a psychiatrist who was able to prescribe me a longer more sustainable medication.\n\nFor therapy with a psychologist, that can take a while, are you going through magellan? I would get on the list now and/or start trying to find someone who accepts yale health insurance if you have it\n\nYou can also call back and request an earlier appointment, or see if they have a list to be on if someone cancels their appointment. \n\nHave you explicitly told yale health how bad it is for you right now? Ive found yale mental health pretty receptive and understanding, and they do try to respond quickly its just a lot of people require services",

When I called for mental health services I remember I had the choice to get a therapist through Yale, or to use my Yale insurance, which every student has even if you dont pay for the full spectrum insurance through Yale, to get one outside of Yale Mental Health. This is what I did. I described what I wanted and they sent me 10 in-network providers to call and set up with. It did take a couple weeks but this is typical even outside the university setting. If you are having suicidal thoughts you should just check yourself in. I know this is easier said than done but based on what you're saying it sounds like you want to get medication and then move on. This is not how mental health treatment typically works. You need a referral to a psychiatrist.\n\nBUT  You can also get meds through a primary care physician. At my undergrad institution, I was able to get zoloft, wellbutrin, and another medication i cant remember all just through the PCP without even being in therapy. This is easier if you have an established diagnosis already.",

            "comment": "I am so sorry that they haven't given you what you need so far. Mental health is serious and you should be taken seriously and the system at Yale is so exhausting just to get help in the first place. I know it's hard, but if you're interested in getting help at Yale (aka having Yale pay for it), my best recommendaion would be to contact MH&amp;C again and not let the next person you talk to let you go without assuring that they are going to put you in contact with someone. I am less familiar about the side with medication because that requires seeing a psychiatrist, but they should be putting you in contact with one if that's what you want. Simply for therapy, the options for grad students is usually either you (1) wait for another month or even more to finally be matched with an in-house clinician (someone that works for Yale MH&amp;C) or (2) get referred to see someone in the community through Magellan. Most students that end up seeing someone thru Magellan I think usually are satisfied with their experience, but getting there takes a lot of work, unfortunately. Luckily, MH&amp;C recently hired someone to be a middle man between students and Magellan to assure that students actually end up getting care. \n\nIf you want immediate care, contact Acute Care (which I think is MH&amp;C's 24 hour service) and they have on-call clinicians. The Chaplain's Office is open for one-time sessions as well if you just want a friendly, but professional face to talk to. \n\nAgain I'm sorry you have to go through this and I know self-advocacy is so hard and tiring, but I hope you're able to get in contact with someone eventually!",

Then when you see your psychiatrist you can go over your medication with them and have them adjust the prescription.",

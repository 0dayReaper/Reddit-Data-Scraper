Would be the least expensive option ($8 to exit the AirTrain at Jamaica, $2.75 for the subway, and $17.75 for the Metro North train). Buy your Metro-North ticket before boarding, either using a ticket machine at Grand Central or the MTA TrainTime app for iOS and Android, as fares purchased onboard are higher.",

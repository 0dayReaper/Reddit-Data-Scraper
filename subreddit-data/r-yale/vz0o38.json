    "postText": "Hi, I'm curious to know how the meal plans work here. I saw on Yale's website that the meals will be in the dining halls and you can't take food outside it. Is this true? Is there any way you eat food outside the dining halls? I ask cause I'd have to use a meal plan because I'll be staying in the dorms but I feel like having to eat in a busy dining hall everyday would be tough on my social anxiety.",

The first couple of times were hard and I had so much anxiety but I quickly realised that literally no one cares and no one's judging. I eat alone quite often now.",

    "postText": "What are the primary differences between the two majors? Which degree would be more versatile in the workforce? Besides breaking into IB or consulting, what do the graduates tend to do with their degrees in EP&amp;E versus economics? \n\nI am deciding between the two as an incoming frosh and would love some advice. Thank you!",

            "comment": "EP&amp;E tends to be more decision-maker focused (politician, think tanks, etc.). Economics tends to be more either research (professor) or practical (analyst, banking, etc.).\n\nThat said, you can't actually be an EP&amp;E major until sophomore year at earliest. It is weirdly restricted that way. So just take the classes that interest you, with an eye towards possible EP&amp;E, and see what you want to do a year from now. Yale is weird in that you are admitted to the *school*, not to a major. You can (and probably will) switch your major a few times. Considering you don't even have to declare until Junior year, there is a lot of time to just see what fits.",

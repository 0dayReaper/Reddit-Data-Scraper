An additional point for starting at Computer Science 201 (so 6 points total).\n\nMeaning I would need to get 30 credits at Yale. Or do 5 courses a semester for 6 semesters?\n\nIs this correct? Or is doing something like this not possible?\n\nThanks!",

Much like other ivies, very few people graduate early.",

It has to be 5 completed terms, and you appeal for early graduation *during* the sixth.",

If 1 awarded: 1 lost by any course numbered 112 or lower.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the site looks to be saying that Id get two accelerations credits because I have a 5   \n on the AP Calc test, and also to be saying that if I didn't have a 5 I would also get 2 credits for starting off in Math 120?\n\nAlso, if I had a 5 on BC Calc, but chose to take Math 112, I would get 0 credits?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI appreciate the help!",

If you hadn't taken AP Calc but took Math 120 and received a B or better, you would have 2 acceleration credits. Note that a maximum of 2 acceleration credits can be earned per subject (row in the link you posted), so getting a 5 on BC and taking a 120+ level course only gives you 2 acceleration credits.",

            "comment": "The other comment is misleading -- you can obtain both degrees, it just requires you to double major. I personally know students who have done the BA/MA in Stats as well as a BS in Math, which should be the same number of credits (or within a +/- 2 range) of a BA/MA in Stats and a BS in Comp Sci.\n\nAlso, the students in question completed their degrees in 4 years, not 5. Frankly, the simultaneous MA/BA in Stats is absurdly easy at Yale due to the rampant cross-listing of courses; if you make it your goal from first year onwards, you won't find it challenging to complete.",

I wouldn't say that the program is absurdly easy unless you're academically inclined though - there are grade requirements for the joint programs.",

You don't have to commit to anything yet, but start planning for it from the start of college, and worst case scenario you drop something. \n\nIn regards to the cross listing, you're only allowed to double count two courses for both majors, so it really doesn't help that much (should double check this - the rules changed this year I believe). Also, as a personal thought, I'm of the opinion that CS and S&amp;DS are closely related enough that there's no point in double majoring in them.",

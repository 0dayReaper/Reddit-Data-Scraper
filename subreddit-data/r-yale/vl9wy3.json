    "postText": "Hi y\u2019all! I was recently sorted into Murray, and I love a lot about it, but I feel like it\u2019s a lot of STEM kids. I\u2019m the exact opposite, and plan to take the easiest and least amount of STEM classes possible since I\u2019m interested in Global Affairs. I was wondering if Murray is close to the GA classes and/or if there is a large population of GA/Poli Sci majors in Murray that I can vibe with? All my roommates are STEM majors which makes me feel that Murray is a predominantly STEM residential college.",

            "comment": "Your major isn't a factor in which college you get put into, it's totally random. Murray/Franklin definitely has a few more STEM majors than most (mostly because of transfers moving in to be closer to science hill), but it won't make much of a difference. There will most definitely be a good few polisci majors in Murray. I mean, you know where the polisci building is, right?",

Now you get to have the happiest of worries on which great institution to call your alma mater :) Post all your questions and comments here. This includes questions about undergrad and grad school admissions alike. We hope to welcome you to the Yale community but also feel free to ask us why it might not necessarily be the best choice for you. Individual posts outside of this megathread are subject to removal.\n\n**Students and alumni**: Let's try our best to give constructive, specific feedback to all prospective Yalies and refrain from comments that would discourage them in any way.",

I found it really easy to maintain a 4.0 at CC, but I worry that I\u2019m not smart enough for Yale tbh\n\n\u2022 EP&amp;E or Econ and why? I like EP&amp;E but I want to double major and it might be easier to graduate on time with Econ since it\u2019s less classes\n\n\u2022 How feasible is double majoring in EP&amp;E and Psych?\n\n\u2022 Thoughts on the Camp Yale Programs? I think I might enroll in one but trying to decide which one\n\n\u2022 I noticed there aren\u2019t many reviews for professors on RMP, do Yalies use a different site for that?\n\n\u2022 How accessible are sports for non-pros? I want to play golf and a few other things but am barely learning\n\n\u2022 Recommendations for pet-friendly apartment complexes within walking or shuttle distance to Yale?\n\nThanks in advance",

I can say that the undergrad classes at Yale are amazingly great. \n\nAs opposed to using rate my professor at Yale, end of semester course evaluation data is aggregated and publicized in an internal database for future students to reference when registering. You\u2019ll see students\u2019 comments and overall course ratings.\n\nYale has a club golf team for non-pros! Club sports are great fun and you\u2019ll meet a lot of friends. See here: https://sportsandrecreation.yale.edu/club-golf\n\nThere aren\u2019t many apartment complexes around Yale, rather two-story houses are typically divided into two apartments, many near Yale Shuttle stops. Apartments are listed in the Yale Housing Facebook group! If you have the opportunity to live on campus in a residential college, I really recommend. It\u2019s a tremendously great experience.\n\nI hope this helped!",

I wanted to double major but the two majors had nothing in common so it wasn\u2019t feasible to do both, now I just take classes in the one field for fun. A lot of people complete their study abroad in the summer, where it doesn\u2019t compete with their semester classes, so that should be doable (unless double majoring requires that you take lots of summer credits at Yale to meet all the major requirements).",

There are a lot where you can simply sign up but most have some form of application (a google doc and maybe a short essay). Others are quite competitive. There will definitely be plenty of clubs for you to join, it just might not be the exact one you wanted.\n\nSocial life is really what you make of it. Some spaces are exclusive-ish due to covid restrictions limiting the number of people who can attend gatherings. But there are a decent number of options. Only big difference is that there isn\u2019t a huge bar scene around campus.",

            "comment": "For current students who have gone through the financial aid review process: about how long does it take and how can I increase my chances of success? I'm in a somewhat complicated financial situation where my parents filed taxes jointly in 2020 but divorced last year, so my parents can't afford to pay as much as the 2020 return would suggest. \n\nI submitted a review form on Sunday and included results of the Net Price Calculator for each parent and added together the net cost which gave me an estimate that is about $13k less than my current cost and am currently waiting to hear back. Any experience with using the Net Price Calculator in negotiating and how faithful they are to what it estimates? All the info I put on there is the same as what I submitted through the FAFSA, IDOC, CSS Profile except for savings and investment values which have changed slightly.\n\nIf that doesn't work, my backup plan is to try to get them to match with Bowdoin. I was not admitted to any other Ivies or Stanford + MIT so I unfortunately can't use that. Bowdoin is still a top 10 LAC by most metrics however and also offers grant-based \"100% need met\" aid. Under ordinary circumstances, Yale would be more generous than Bowdoin but their current net cost for me is still $7k less than Yale's. Has anyone previously tried to do this or think they'll consider Bowdoin's offer?\n\nSorry for all the questions lol, just nervous about this whole thing since I really want to attend but this cost is in the way  and I only have under a month now to get it figured out.\n\nEDIT for those still in this thread: Just got back with an offer $14k less than what it was and even more generous than I expected! The review process was easy and relatively quick taking only 5 days. Can't wait to attend!",

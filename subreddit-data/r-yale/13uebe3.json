I\u2019m first-gen so this whole college thing is new to me!",

Under very specific circumstances your major may be in an admission's officer's mind. But there is no way that any particular schedule, especially during your first year, will affect your law school admission potential.\n\nHonestly, if you absolutely want to get into a top law school, *not* taking DS is probably better. Take every gut you can, don't learn anything, and get as close to a 4.0 as you can. The admissions programs for law have really perverse incentives.\n\nSigned, a former first-gen student now lawyer.",

I\u2019ve been contemplating and mulling over between DS or not DS for the past few days, and it helps to take a perspective from a law student! \n\nBy any chance, can I PM you to ask a few more questions. I promise it\u2019d be quick and short \u2014 I\u2019m just nervous about entering this new phase of my life and feeling so underprepared. \n\nThanks again!",

I am! \n\nI am considering law school, and I did take DS, but not for that reason. \nLike other people said, they don\u2019t care at all. It\u2019s GPA and LSAT. I took DS and had an amazing time because I just wanted to read and talk about those books. Simple as that. \n\nAnd if you\u2019re not drawn to the program for the program\u2019s sake, then 1) your chances of enjoying it are lower and 2) you\u2019re spending valuable credit hours doing something you don\u2019t care about when you could be taking courses you do care about.\n\nSo, even though I took DS and I enjoyed it, I would actually suggest not doing DS if that\u2019s not you would genuinely prefer to do. \n\nIf you want to have more rigour, you could take 5 classes\u2026 but please don\u2019t do it 1st semester. That\u2019s just unnecessary, so much time is taken up by getting used to college life and rythm. \n\nOverall, I would remember high school: did what you did Freshman first semester *really* matter?\nTake it easy and welcome to Yale!!",

I've had to do a lot of reading on my own to make up the gap. If you're really interested in the subject matter, there's nothing comparable. \n\nThat said, others are right that it doesn't serve someone with law school ambitions. If anything, the rigor of the work may end up hurting your GPA.",

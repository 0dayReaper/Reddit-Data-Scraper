    "postText": "Hi guys, I have a few questions regarding the Yale noncustodial parent waiver request. If they reject it, do they email you, or would the requirement just remain missing on the portal? \n\n Also, is having four letters from teachers and counselors verifying that I do not have contact with my noncustodial parent enough for it?",

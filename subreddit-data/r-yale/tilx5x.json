The main reason I\u2019m choosing Yale is because I feel like the student body is def more tight knit/friendly and I think that New Haven is safer than New York. Also, Yale just generally seems like significantly less stressful experience and I think that outcomes are better(?). I wanna give Columbia a chance though because their honors program sounds really interesting.",

It\u2019s just that many people around me (both for my major and other subjects) were competitive to the point of not sharing any info, and a couple of them even got busted trying to sabotage other students. I mentioned the correlation between competitiveness and majors because those I knew who did major in subjects like EP&amp;E, MB&amp;B, math and econ, etc. did have a very stressful time. I obviously didn\u2019t know all the students and some people seemed to coast their way through all the coursework and end up in phi beta kappa, but the criteria I mentioned seemed to correlate well with stress levels.\n\nI\u2019m Asian and hung out a lot with other Asians, btw.",

We stayed overnight, and we're looking for *something* to do that night, but all the Columbia students we asked basically told us, \"Hmmm... if you don't have an ID that says you're 21... we can't think of anything to do...\"\n\nMaybe we just got unlucky not finding the right group of students, but my impression of Columbia is definitely that student life is much more outwardly-focused, where students go out and do activities in the city, whereas Yale is much more inwardly-focused, where virtually all your time is spent with other Yale students. Personally, I loved that aspect of Yale! It's definitely a \"bubble\", but being stuck in a bubble with some of the coolest, most interesting, most creative motherfuckers in the world is pretty damn great!",

I can't speak exactly to why she didn't apply to Columbia, but Columbia is a cloistered thumbstamp. I\u2019m not anti city but I was surprised how claustrophobic the campus made me feel with tiny green spaces and gates/walls/elevation separating the campus spaces from the surrounding neighborhood (not that security is a bad thing, but such security suggests it is necessary, so consider that). We walked on outdoor campus paths from the center of campus to the engineering school and reached the edge of campus, looked out and realized we were four stories above the street with no way out if we got down there b/c locked gates. Yale's campus is expansive - 373 acres to Columbia's 36 (and I have to wonder if Columbia's 36 is contiguous or combined separate campuses, I feel like the latter). it is several blocks through campus between the center of Yale's campus to science hill, but it's all pretty sweet &amp; very much what I look for in a college campus",

Yale has more activities on campus and right around campus so there are more organic opportunities to hang out with classmates than there would be at Columbia. \n\nIf you can visit and stay overnight with some students to get a sense of the place.",

    "postText": "prefrosh here, debating on applying to DS \u2014 i know pretty much anyone who wants to get into DS gets in, so i want to make sure i know the ins and outs of ds before officially applying. my goal after undergrad is to attend a t14 law school, and i know the ds program is pretty well renowned and will probably be a plus on my YLS app, but i\u2019m worried about the workload considering i need as close to a 4.0 as possible for law school. i\u2019ve heard the nickname for ds be \u201cdirected suicide,\u201d so im looking for general thoughts/notions about the program. \n\nit\u2019s important to add i\u2019m not looking to join DS just for the name but for the skills it may produce, like critical thinking, reasoning, essay writing etc, but i\u2019m not sure if gaining those skills balance out against possibly jeopardizing my gpa \n\nany advice is appreciated",

Law school is an independent thing, and to whatever extent anything prepares you, it certainly isn't what courses you select first year. And the person above, from a pure strategy standpoint, is dead on. GPA-protect, major in whatever tf you want, and grind LSAT when the time comes. Law school is a whole other can of worms than any undergrad class. I don't say this to dunk on you, you're asking a fair question, but the notion that the content of any course would prepare you for law school is nonsensical. \n\nNow I'd also argue that myopically optimizing for law school admissions chances, especially this early in your Yale career, is a bad idea. But that's another conversation...",

            "comment": "Going to repost a comment I made on a similar thread once:\n\n&gt; I think the difficulty of DS is generally overrated -- some students do struggle, but this mostly comes down to two factors:\n\n&gt; 1. Transitioning to college coursework is often hard if you didn't go to a good high school (private / magnet / top public / etc)\n&gt; 2. Humanities classes in college have no direct analogue at most high schools, whereas something like General Chemistry is reasonably well approximated by AP Chem\n\n&gt; None of these factors are related to the inherent difficulty of the DS coursework, so if you have the right background, you may even find DS rather easy.\n\n&gt; On the workload front -- less than 5 students out of ~100 per year read all of the assigned readings. You'll be fine. Feel free to pm if you want more info.\n\nThere are of course easier courseloads you could take, but I don't actually think DS is harder than an average (or perhaps slightly above median) set of 3 humanities classes for most first years.",

I recommend DS to prospective EP&amp;E majors though \u2014 DS might actually be more manageable than the pre-reqs you would have to seek out independently. EP&amp;E is also a great pre-law major in my opinion.\n\nOne recommendation I have is, regardless of if you do DS, take a class with a law professor. I took Con Law my sophomore year and it absolutely encouraged me to want to go to law school. My friend at another Ivy took a law class and had the exact opposite experience. So you should see if you actually like the nature of legal education \u2014 it is very different from social science/humanities in undergrad.",

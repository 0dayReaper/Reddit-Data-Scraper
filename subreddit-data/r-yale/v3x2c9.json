    "postText": "Hi everyone. I\u2019m an incoming MPH student and I\u2019m trying to find housing with a roommate in the downtown area. Dwight/East Rock/WoosterSq have been suggested to us but we really value being close to med campus. \n\nNeither of us have been to New Haven so we were wondering if there\u2019s any areas to avoid in downtown? We\u2019re currently considering Crown Court but would love to  have any suggestions. \n\nThanks!",

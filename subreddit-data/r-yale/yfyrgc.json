    "postText": "Hi, \n\nIm soon applying to Yale REA. I am aware that there are no business schools or majors for undergrad. Is there a major that feeds into it besides Economics? I am mostly sure that I want to go into business administration/finance but not fully committed to it. Is it worth doing REA to a school that doesn't have an undergraduate business program like Yale? Should I focus on some of my other choices with great undergraduate business programs, and possibly ED? Yale attracts me in almost every way, except that I would not be able to do what I think I want to do. Does going undecided affect my admissions chance? Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you.",

            "comment": "Rest assured, wanting to do finance at Yale would make you the least special person there. TONS of people from various majors go into finance - it's made relatively easy by the fact that you went to Yale at all. Take a look here.\n\n[https://ocs.yale.edu/outcomes/](https://ocs.yale.edu/outcomes/)\n\n~~Also, Yale does not have \"restricted\" early action. I~~ don't remember if you can apply completely undecided but your major choices are non-binding in any way, even after you get there.",

It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with restricting your major choice.",

Nearly every force acting on your career after graduation is going to funnel you in the direction of business (hey, capitalism!), so take undergrad as an opportunity to focus on something else. Straight Econ will prepare you plenty while being more generally meaningful to your life than a business major. And you can study just about anything else instead and still go into finance after school.",

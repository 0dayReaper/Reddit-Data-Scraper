    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming student to Yale SOM and was trying to find decent housing, ideally off campus. I wanted something that isn\u2019t too far from Evans and Payne Whitney, and something between 1000-1500 per month budget wise. I saw that Yale owns some off campus apartments that are managed by Elmcampus but after checking apartments.com, they seem unavailable right now. Does anyone have any idea if and when they become available? Are they worth it? My program begins in August and I\u2019d ideally want a 12 month lease.\n\nAny info or even alternative suggestions are much appreciated!",

I wouldn't recommend renting sight unseen...I lived in an ElmCampus spot on Broadway and just couldn't adapt to it because it was so noisy. That said, you have a baseline trust of what you're getting if you rent with them. Just ask lots of questions andbe picky if you can.",

However the intersection is *extremely* loud - music, sirens, motorcycles - so personally I found it very difficult to sleep. Many/most? grad students live in East Rock, which is a quieter and safer neighbourhood (but of course more expensive)",

You won\u2019t be that close to Payne Whitney but could drive or bike there easily. You could also just use Fit for Thought inside Evans Hall, which is small but cheap for SOM students. If you haven\u2019t gotten any info from current students, reach out to them and ask any second years if they\u2019re looking to give up their place for next year",

That's how I found my room, and in my experience a lot of apartments never end up publicly available for rent. My unit has been privately passed from grad student to grad student for years and hasn't been publicly listed for ages. With studios and 1br apts it seems like a lot of people look for someone to take over their lease before it ends, and then that person signs on for another 12 mo.",

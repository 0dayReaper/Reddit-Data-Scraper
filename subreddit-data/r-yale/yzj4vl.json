I went to Yale undergrad and the only person I know who transferred in was a fraud with faked transcripts etc\u2026 So, I don\u2019t want to dissuade you but I am warning you the odds are much lower than 1/100 and also asking with all sincerity why you think you might be accepted.",

For the record, I know a few transfer students who WEREN'T frauds, and are off doing amazing things at Yale. Best of luck w the application process.",

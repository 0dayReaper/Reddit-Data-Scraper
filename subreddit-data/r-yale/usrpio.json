My brother was in Sig Ep at FSU so he's been trying to help me research but it's been pretty difficult finding information about how to rush and fraternities at Yale. I was interested in Alpha Delta Phi or Sigma Chi possibly? But honestly, any frat would be great I think. Any and all info would be appreciated :)",

    "postText": "Hey current Yalies! I\u2019m currently struggling to decide which language to take to fulfill my language credit for Yale and I\u2019ve narrowed it down to Italian and Japanese.  From what I\u2019ve read both seem like AMAZING programs and I really could see myself in both but I honestly can t decide between the two.  If anyone has taken either of these languages at Yale PLEASE let me know how you felt in the classes and any professors I should look out for!!\n\nAlso how was the grading?  Do most kids get A\u2019s? Or are these languages where it\u2019s nearly impossible to do well.  I\u2019m willing to put in the work but I don\u2019t want a class that will tank my GPA.  How is the department? How is the workload from L1-L3?? Any advice will help!! Tysm!!",

Also, there's a Barnes and Noble, or used to be off the Green.\n\nCross campus library, too.\n\nPlus most of the residential colleges and the law school have Cafeterias and reading rooms... As a grad student, you can talk to a dean about getting access... Undergrads love chatting with grad students",

Down Orange Street, parallel to SOM, is a nice Blue State Coffee, where you can chill and study. Lots of options.",

    "postText": "I want to apply for financial aid at Yale. The problem is that here in Yemen and due to the conflict we pay no taxes any more. So, how am I supposed to show Yale that I am in need for the financial aid?\n\nUnfortunately, the only document that I can provide to Yale is a letter from my father's employer. Will this document suffice? And what should I do if not?\nThank you.",

    "postText": "Hi guys, I got accepted to Yale for their BME PhD program but have heard little to nothing about the program itself. Is it a prestigious program? Are they a lot of resources for students? What is the overall consensus? Are students happy? Is there a social or friendly scene between students?\n\nPlease tell me everything :) I'm considering it since it is a prestigious school in itself and I admire the New Haven area. I got accepted to a lab which is doing research I like, but the students don't seem the most excited. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease let me know!",

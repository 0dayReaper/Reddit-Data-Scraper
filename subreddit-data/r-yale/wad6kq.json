    "postText": "Hi! I am a rising high school senior interested in majoring in applied math at Yale and was wondering if there are any students who would be willing to answer some questions about the program. Thanks!\n\nEdit: \n\nSome specific questions I have:\n\n- Do you feel like people in the major are collaborative/do you feel supported?\n- Do a lot of students end up doing a double major in it with another area?\n- Is it easy to focus applied math with a non-STEM area of study and is there a lot of freedom with what you can do with it?\n- Are there any research opportunities available for it and is it easy to become involved in these opportunities?\n- How are the professors and classes overall?\n\nIf anyone could provide some insight into literally any of these questions, that would be much appreciated!",

It covers prereqs and required classes: [http://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/subjects-of-instruction/applied-mathematics/](http://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/subjects-of-instruction/applied-mathematics/)\n\nApplied math is pretty unique because you get a lot of control over the courses you select. It's a lot less restrictive than some of the other STEM majors.",

Just edited the post to include some more specific questions.\n\nI have read over the Program of Study, and it seems like exactly what I\u2019m looking for! The freedom of the major and the ability to combine in with other areas of study is really what attracts me to applied math, and from the website it seems like those are aspects of the program that Yale does very well. Of course, reading about something is different than actually going through it which is why I would love to hear student experiences in the major.",

            "comment": "Hi, I\u2019m a current applied math student at Yale! I\u2019m glad you\u2019re considering applied math at Yale. To your questions:\n\n1. The major is a relatively small one, so I don\u2019t think there is too much of a sense of an applied math student community here. However, in general I think students at Yale are collaborative, and since you get to take classes in departments you can make friends in many different departments who are likely going to be nice and supportive. Our administrative/faculty support is weaker than adjacent departments, such as the statistic and data science department. \n\n2. Yes some students double major (myself included) with applied math, but in general I would not recommend double majoring and have some regrets about double majoring. \n\n3. There are, but you\u2019d have to put in effort to seek them out. It may be of interest to you to look into past applied math students senior thesis to get a flavor of what projects students work on. \n\n4. Plenty of research opportunities, and they are easy to get. If you do a BS, research is a requirement. \n\n5. Profs and classes overall vary. The applied math department does not really offer any classes of its own, so the majority of your classes will more strongly fall under a different departments control. I\u2019ve generally enjoyed the classes I\u2019ve took for my major, especially because of the flexibility in course selection. However, I don\u2019t think the professors have been very devoted to their teaching/mentoring of undergraduates for the most part since they are so busy with their research. \n\nHope this helps and feel free to send me any follow up questions! Best of luck",

What else are you majoring in and why do you regret double majoring? Also, it\u2019s totally fine if you don\u2019t have a definite answer for this, but from your responses it doesn\u2019t sound like applied math is necessarily the strongest major at Yale. I\u2019m currently deciding whether to apply early to Yale or Brown, which is known for being good in Applied Math, but I really love Yale overall, would you still recommend Yale for an Applied Math major? Thanks again!",

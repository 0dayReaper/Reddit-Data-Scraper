I would focus more on where you want to spend the next four years of your life. A few sample questions that might help guide you:\n\nWould you prefer the bustling, exciting city life of Manhattan, or the gentler, still-vibrant small-city life of New Haven?\n\nDo you want the academic freedom available at Yale, or are you excited to study the common core with your peers at Columbia as a unit?\n\nDo you find students friendlier at Yale or Columbia?\n\nWhich college has housing and dining that you prefer? Where you sleep and what you eat for the next four years of your life will have some effect on your happiness.\n\nIt goes without saying that I would pick Yale if I were you (based), but Columbia is a fine institution. You can't go wrong! Congratulations, by the way, few get to choose between two such great universities.",

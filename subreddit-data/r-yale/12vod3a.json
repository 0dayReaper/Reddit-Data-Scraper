    "postText": "Hi! I'm an incoming first year and prospective economics major who's planning to do take the following courses (I'm hoping to get an A\\* in A-level Economics, which should place me out of the introductory sequence in econ):\n\n**Fall 2023**  \nECON 121: Intermediate Microeconomics  \nMATH 120: Calculus of Functions of Several Variables  \nCHNS 110: Elementary Modern Chinese I  \nFirst Year Seminar\n\n**Spring 2024**  \nECON 122: Intermediate Macroeconomics  \nMATH 225: Linear Algebra  \nCHNS 120: Elementary Modern Chinese II  \nFirst Year Seminar/Some elective\n\nI'm not sure if I want to go to grad school or work in finance, but I want to keep both options open at first (high GPA, math classes, enough free time to do clubs and excel/programming on the side, et cetera). My question is: should I be taking the econometrics sequence right away instead of seminars and languages or is it okay if I wait till sophomore year? What do econ majors generally do?",

Idk if you're also doing economics for graduate school, but if you are\u2014would you recommend taking MATH 246 and 247? I even applied as an applied math major but realized (thanks to A-level further math) that I wasn't wired to do a lot of pure math topics (real analysis will be a drag but I probability and statistics, though!).\n\nAlso, do you know if it's possible to do Econ and Math BA and Econ MA concurrently or must it be Econ BA and MA? I probably won't end up taking graduate courses because I'm not keen on filling my schedule with nothing but requirements, but I'm still curious.",

But depending on how your math is, it can be a really rough first foray into undergraduate economics.\n\nUnless you do something like or theoretical micro with dynamically optimizing agents or theoretical finance, you won't really use ODE and PDE much.\n\n\nAside from calc/linalg, analysis and probability (ideally something meatier than 135/136) are by far the most important fields of math to successfully get through a first year core of graduate school.",

I was confused between 121+122 and 125+126 as well so I asked a first year econ major, but they couldn't tell if the difference was huge. Do you think starting with 125 will be possible if I know single variable calculus quite well but barely know any multivariate and linalg? If not, I don't really have an option (other than grinding multivariate and linalg this summer and trying to get permission from the 125 instructor).",

If you want to get intermediate econ out of the way by freshman year, one option is to take multivariable in the fall and intermediate econs together in the spring. Intermediate micro and macro don't really have dependency off of each other. You can DM me for more details if you want.",

Though you'll get some advantages in linalg. \n\nAside from that schedule looks fine. I would take more \"out there\" classes though, electives are fun and exploring whilst ur a freshman is a much better idea than finding you live another academic field as a senior lol",

Use credit/d\u2019s on courses that are interesting but are hard and aren\u2019t part of your requirements.  You can even start taking a course for a grade then use a credit/d midway through. Don\u2019t have to lock on credit/d at the start of the semester\n\nGrading depends on the professor\n\nI think you might want to start with Math 115, or at least see what your placement test says. Math 120 is brutal. I started out with it and still think I should\u2019ve done 115 instead\n\nSame with economics. If you aren\u2019t fully confident in your Econ skills, take intro micro and macro this year instead. It won\u2019t set you back. I started out with intro micro my freshman spring and still completed a double major. The intro micro and macro seminars are pretty good if you can get in them.\n\nAlso plan on only 1 first year seminar because they\u2019re pretty popular, so they really try and limit students on 1 for the year in the course selection process.\n\nI also agree with the other users that you should try and mix it up more first year.  You never know what you might like!",

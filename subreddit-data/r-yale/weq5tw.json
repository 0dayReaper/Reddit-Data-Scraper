    "postText": "I\u2018m an incoming student and have no idea what costs to expect to get my IUD placement checked on Yale\u2018s health insurance. I saw that a yearly female health checkup was included for free and that getting an IUD placed as a form of emergency contraception is also free. But what about the yearly checkup ultrasounds to make sure everything is in place? Not sure whether to set up my checkup back home or in New Haven. \nFeel free to also DM me if you don\u2019t want to comment here. Thanks in advance.",

Why does the Murray setup make the line block off the utensil and drink areas??? Stiles and Morse have best food and also minimal lines since buffet is double sided. Also beautiful lighting with giant wall of windows and late hours!",

Silliman: Really nice interior and good location, but tends to be a bit crowded.  \n3. Davenport, 4. JE, 5. Branford: Good all around. Not much to say.  \n6. Saybrook: Quite a nice-looking interior. Points off for a bad layout where you often have to squeeze past people to get in and out of the food area.  \n7. TD: Little to no lines, tables outside, maybe the only dining hall where none of the paintings are bad. Not a lot of food options though, especially at breakfast.  \n8. Berkeley. Good food, great location, nice atmosphere, weird painting of Marvin Chun where the background details are equally in focus to the foreground. The problem is, it's too good, so there are huge lines all the time.\n\nMid:  \n9. Trumbull: A bit poorly lit in some areas, but doesn't deserve the hate.  \n10. Murray: Really far away from most residential buildings. Other than that, fine.  \n11. Pierson: Has a suit of armor. Otherwise, not much to recommend it. Also has a really unnerving painting watching over you.\n\nBad:  \n12. Franklin: Embarrassingly tacky interior. Far away from everything.  \n13. Hopper: Actually not too bad as long as you like eating bad food in a poorly lit room with a hilariously large number of tables crammed into it that nobody uses because of the aforementioned bad food and poor lighting.",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve always wanted to do this\n\n1. BF: all the amenities, best food.\n2. MY: like BF/longer lines, more confusing design and no fucking steady water supply lmao\n3. Stiles/Morse: second best food, decent location EDIT: from replies, valid point: late dinner hours\n4. Berkeley: good food but awful lines \n5. TD: food is mid but there\u2019s almost never a line and their grill is pretty sweet. Obviously, I think their staff are second to none but that\u2019s true in every dining hall. I\u2019m probably a little biased here, but it\u2019s definitely middle of the pack. \n6. Pierson: Good food but in the middle of nowhere, most unique dining hall\n7. Silliman: bad food, long lines, but good location and selection, especially for breakfast (science hill still GOATed for breakfast)\n8. Trumbull: widely underrated. Not good but great location and better than way more on this list \n9. Branford. Somehow, leagues better than saybrook, but still very underwhelming\n10. Davenport: mid food, weird setup, some redeeming qualities\n11. JE. Disappointed every time I come here. Still less so than others\n12. Saybrook. Their single redeeming factor is their occasional extra hot food, but they are churning out slime here\n13. Hopper. The average color of the food is grey. Every time I\u2019m here it\u2019s because Berkeley is too crowded, and every time I\u2019m here I get so upset I vow never to return. Do not eat here.\n\nEDIT 2: Commons pasta bolognese is GOATed if you eat meat and like late lunches, steep also gives you a good bang for your buck, bow wow, elm, and ivy suck ass, ramen at becton doesnt exist and you can\u2019t convince me otherwise",

Any particular perks, or on the other side anything to be wary of going in? Any employee softball teams or happy hours or anything like that? (I'm in my mid-20s if it helps!)",

The university is so large, everything is very decentralized. I would recommend signing up at subscribe.yale.edu for any topic you find remotely interesting, it's the best way I've found to hear about upcoming events.",

That\u2019s said I would say if you are looking to socialize getting in with grad students your age is the way to go\u2014friends with GYPSY membership would definitely get you plugged in to the scene. If you are doing post-doc work that should be easy for you as they will populate your lab. Other than that there\u2019s not much to say except picking a neighborhood to live in (East Rock!) and finding stuff you like to do. Once you have a core network and some habitual haunts you\u2019ll find it\u2019s pretty easy to grow your social network. I met a friend just playing Pandemic (the board game) at Rudy\u2019s for instance\u2026",

I worked medical for 8 years and it nearly killed me.  \n\nThen i moved to Central Campus/ FAS Humanities is a sweet gig, even in hard roles. \n\nI am a department registrar/chair's assistant and it can be VERY stressful, but also mad chill.  \n\nI am married with wife and kids now so i ain't in your shoes anymore, but I was not long ago. \n\nThere is a lot to do in new haven, but I gotta recommend Elm City Games- it is a local table top role playing game shop, BYOB/food, all around incredible spot to meet people from all walks of life.",

Haven\u2019t heard of any employee sports teams. I\u2019m also in my mid 20\u2019s. Lmk if you want to link up sometime! I can show you around!",

A lot of graduate students leave in East Rock which is a little farther from campus but has nice restaurants and bigger houses. Some people who work in labs up Prospect Street (like in Physics or Chemistry) live on Mansfield Street. A lot of people who work in/near the Medical School live on Dwight or Park Streets. Undergrads live all over the place based on their interests but Dwight, Elm, Park, Howe, Edgewood are probably the most common places for off-campus apartments.",

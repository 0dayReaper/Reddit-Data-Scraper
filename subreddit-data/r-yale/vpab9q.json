    "postText": "Hello, I'm going to be starting at Yale college this fall. I am a violinist and I enjoy playing in orchestras, but I am not terribly good at it. It was not one of my main activities in high school, but I still would like to play violin in college. I cannot audition for the Yale symphony orchestra because the rehearsal times conflict with my schedule. However, I noticed the Berkeley college orchestra and am interested in auditioning for that.\n\nMy question is, how intense is the orchestra, both in terms of auditioning and difficulty of the music they play? About how long do players spend practicing each week? Thanks!",

We are a pretty laid-back and relaxed group, mainly made up of people like you who have played in high school and want to continue with the instrument, but without the intensity of YSO. We rehearse for two hours once a week. Please PM me if you want to be added to our email list for audition information next fall.",

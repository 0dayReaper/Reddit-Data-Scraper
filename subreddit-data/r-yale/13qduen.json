I\u2019ve had the amazing luck of being admitted to several other incredible schools and am trying to narrow down my choice. I'm planning on majoring in Environmental Engineering and would love to hear about anyone's experience in this major. Feel free to PM me if you don't feel comfortable commenting. Thank you all so much!!",

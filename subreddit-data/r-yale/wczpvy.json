As a result, it'll be pretty warm in the summer but more or less however warm you want during the winter. I personally just used a pretty standard blanket and was fine during the winter, but many people bring comforters",

A dehumidifier can be useful as well because the mugginess really adds to it (however, I am from a super dry state so that may just be my tolerance). As other ppl have mentioned there are heaters in the room, so winters are more tolerable. Bring a cozy blanket or two and if you get cold easy bring sweatpants and warm socks for when you stay inside your suite!",

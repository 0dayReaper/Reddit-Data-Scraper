I had to write out the word using English letters and then translate it (idea for future applications to remove the \u201c????\u201d)\nCommonapp should change this formatting and I wish I knew a way to bypass it. \n\nOnce you get access to your application portal I\u2019m sure you can request a change to your application. I\u2019m pretty certain that there are forms for this. If you can\u2019t change your application, admissions officers would most likely understand this small error in the context of your application and not hold it against you. \n\nWishing you the best!!",

You've got great extracurriculars, grades, supplementals, but then they see the comment that your essay reader made sure to write in bold letters at the top of their review: \"Hindi Word Detected\". As you know, Yale hates diversity, so the committee immediately prepares your rejection letter in a shameful font (probably Arial) and proceeds to frame your application in Beinecke Library along with the meager collection of Yale applications that thought they were good enough despite having errors. You see, here at Yale, we're just better. Mistakes are beneath us, so I'd start looking at maybe entering through a transfer program, and don't make a mistake ever again during this intermediate period.\n\nFor legal reasons, this is sarcasm, and in summary, you'll be fine bud. You'll meet some people at Yale that will make you wonder if they even submitted an essay.",

    "postText": "I am a non-traditional student who's kind of been all over and done a bit of everything. I failed two years of high school because I was being a stupid teenager, made it up in my senior year and with summer school, got my diploma in the summer of 2013, and had no idea what to do with my life. I wrote some novels, worked a lot of odd jobs, traveled the world, and enrolled in a community college creative writing class in 2015. I continued part-time, with just a class or two here and there while I worked and pursued my art, and then I finally enrolled full-time in 2019. I earned a 4.0 GPA all throughout community college, and then I transferred in 2021 to UC Berkeley with enough merit-based scholarships that it amounted to a full-ride. I maintained that 4.0 there, got involved, and really did my best to make it work despite feeling since the beginning like it was way too big a university for me. Unfortunately, I had to medically withdraw from this semester because I was hit by a car, got a concussion, and found out my immune system is severely suppressed for some reason (it has been a *month*, let me tell you). So, I'm out until December and possibly longer if it takes the doctor longer to figure out my immune system issues. Luckily, I've found some work I can do from home in this time to keep active and productive. I'm realizing that this break, though, however long it lasts, could be the perfect opportunity to reevaluate where I am, where I want to be in the future, and what's going to best help me get there.\n\nOne of the biggest things I've struggled with at Cal is the fact that I am a disabled student. Bless the school for trying, but Berkeley's just too big to function well for those of us who need a little more in terms of accommodations/support. We fall through the cracks all the time, and it's a shame because we're obviously capable and intelligent people or we wouldn't have gotten into Cal in the first place. The resources I need *do* exist, but because I'm competing for those resources with 45,000 other students, they're all but impossible to access 99% of the time which renders them useless. While I've managed to do well for myself here, this is only because I've been able to attend part-time (I am still considered a junior, just based on units). Without the proper help, it's been exceptionally difficult to manage, and I know it doesn't need to be this hard. This has me thinking that maybe a school with a smaller student body, with more easily accessible resources, with a larger endowment to ensure all those resources are fully funded, and with small enough class sizes to ensure I'm able to ask all the questions I need, might be a better fit for me as a learner. So, I did some digging and came across the Eli Whitney Program at Yale. Obviously, I've heard of Yale, but I'd never heard a thing about this program until recently. There really isn't a whole lot of information online about it (which I expect comes down to the fact that it's pretty niche and there simply aren't a lot of people in the program), but I'd still love to learn more about it! \n\nI have no idea if I'm the type of student Yale would even consider since, on paper, I'm doing well where I am. But hey, I got into a lot of schools I never thought I would back when I was sending out my transfer apps, so you never know! Is there anyone who's either in the program right now or who's recently graduated who might be able to talk to me about what it's like?\n\nThank you so much.",

As for your second question, there are resources to prepare you for grad school, and going to Yale can definitely help you to become a competitive applicant but your performance as a person and student will definitely be more important than school status. Don't get me wrong, it is a bonus but if you're a significantly poor student the name won't help you. One thing that is a plus is the interaction you get with grad students. They are usually happy to share their experiences and that can be a tremendous help. Hope this answers your question. \ud83d\ude0a",

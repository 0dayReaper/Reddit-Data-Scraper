I get a lot of things from H&amp;M, Pacsun, Urban Outfitters, UNIQLO, etc, if you want some ideas. I also buy a lot from ASOS &amp; Boohoo, but I don't think those sites are as big in the US.",

Also good to keep in mind that because Connecticut Post Mall is so close, most/many New Haveners will go there for clothes shopping rather than the city itself.",

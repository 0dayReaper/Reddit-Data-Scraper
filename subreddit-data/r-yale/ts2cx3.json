    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm wondering if grad students outside the music school (ie. folks at Jackson or the School of Management) have any access to music practice rooms \u2013 in particular rooms with drums, space for guitar amps (or amps already there), microphones, etc? I won't be studying music, but it's an important part of daily life for me, and it would be amazing if this was an available resource (for instance, to get a band together or practice solo). \n\nIf this isn't available for non-music folks, is there a low-cost/low-commitment way of getting access to such rooms? I wouldn't want to take an entire course just to have access, for example.\n\nMany thanks!",

Look for classes with a MUSI course code, the techy ones usually give you lab access.",

Dept of Music is the way to go IMHO!",

    "postText": "Hi guys! A year ago I shared here the survey for my undergraduate thesis about inclusion of low-income and students of color in the Ivy Leagues and NYU and I wanted to thank you all of you who were so willing to participate and for your generosity sharing your experiences. Even one of Yale students shared their email on the survey and we chatted a little (hi if it's you reading this!). It meant the world to me graduating with honors on the thesis! I feel very happy, if this work is so important is thanks to all your valuable testimonies. I was able to publish it in the research platform of my uni, so if any of you is interested in checking the results you can dm me :)\n\nI hope you have a wonderful end of the year, if you ever need the help of a spanish-speaker journalist... you can count on me! Cheers &lt;3",

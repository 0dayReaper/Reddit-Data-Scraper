            "comment": "If you\u2019re going to only take one semester of biochem, you\u2019re better off with MCDB as MB&amp;B 300 is part of a two-semester sequence and only covers protein biochemistry, with 301 covering nucleic acids. That said, if you actually want to learn biochem in an in-depth and rigorous way, I can\u2019t recommend MB&amp;B highly enough. It was a hard-ish class because the material was difficult, not because of bullshit professors or dumb grading schemes, and I learned A TON. Highly recommend it if you\u2019re at all interested in truly learning biochem.",

With that said, if you need a year of biochemistry take the MB&amp;B sequence (You will learn a lot). However, if you\u2019re premed and you\u2019re just trying to check off the requirement, MCDB300 is better as you\u2019ll learn both protein and nucleic acid biochemistry in the same semester (with less depth for sure). If you\u2019re an MB&amp;B major, the sequence is mandatory.",

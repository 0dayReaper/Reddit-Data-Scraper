The group sessions were very insightful and I received meaningful feedback and resources about the publishing world. We had guest authors, such as Amor Towles and Natasha Deon, speak about the craft of writing and to field questions from the participants. I worked with the other participants in my session but unfortunately failed to form meaningful bonds.",

There were current Yale students (18-21) and a couple workshoppers who appeared more seasoned (50-70's). The majority of the participants appeared to be in the mid-20's to mid-30's. I hope this helps! And Good luck!",

Have you been to any other workshops? I tend to drift towards character driven literary fiction. Non-fiction is tough, I commend you! Children's books are pretty cool, that's a great goal to have as well.",

    "postText": "I'm coming in as a pre-frosh and freaking out about being uncertain on career paths, courses to take, and generally feel a little behind. I opted out of Directed Studies because I felt the schedule was too rigid, and wanted to get a feel for Yale first before I do anything intense -- but now I'm sensing it was a mistake because I heard it's a good foundation for EPE and it seems well-respected across campus (and that draws out the overachiever in me...).\n\nThis is possibly the biggest decision I've faced in my life, and the added pressure of being in a prestigious environment like Yale may be exacerbating it. Also, my awareness of my intensive anxiety makes me even *more* afraid because so far, I've only met Yalies who seem nonchalant and reassured about their career gateways. \n\nHow can I overcome my fears? I'm frantically trying to \"plan out\" my academic life at Yale, but at every decision, I'm weighing it against a million others and I'm scared I won't about lost opportunities, missed chances, etc. Sorry for the ramble and the overexcessiveness of this post but I would greatly appreciate some advice ! :)",

It stresses me out a little bit, but I'm not too fazed, because that's life. Remember that regardless of even what you major in, you can always turn a 180 and work towards a new goal.\n\nYour hopes and aspirations will evolve as you grow up, but you ARE going to get a college degree (go you!), and it's going to be... fine :)",

Its biggest pro seems to be providing structure to your academic life, which I think is neat if you think you need that. Otherwise, (not to state the obvious), but relax. You're in the line for a scary, exciting rollercoaster ride whose peak you can't see from the ground. It's understandably anxiety-inducing when the other people in line with you seem unfazed, but at the end of the day, everyone has their metaphorical ups and downs. For the most part, it's going to be... fine :)\n\nIF NOT EXCELLENT :D",

A lot are fairly easy to get, but tedious to apply for. Go get dat yale monies",

A Yale degree will NOT just drop jobs into your lap. Idk what you're majoring in, if it's CS you'll be fine. But there are NOT that many good jobs for fresh grads with only general skills. And sure, you can change your mind later. But you should think of your career as an extremely large ship...you can turn it around, but it takes far more effort than you think. Meanwhile, your friends will be gaining skills &amp; seniority in their chosen fields. \n\nWhen in doubt, choose something with good career progression and worry about finding something you like better later. Sincerely, a millennial who's been through it.",

As long as you're honest with yourself and do research about what your studying x would allow you to do after graduating and work hard, I think you should be fine.\n\nAlso, try and reach out to upperclassmen that are where you want to be and ask them how they got there! Mentorship is so important here especially if you don't have family that can help you navigate college",

So, there is no longer a Student Income Contribution, Yale got rid of it for this year :) which is super awesome because it was a massive financial burden on many students and families. So, if you get a 100% Yale grant/scholarship award, you will pay nothing to Yale. The only thing you would need to cover it like the flight here, etc. I got the startup grant this year, don\u2019t know if it\u2019s changed, but there\u2019s a system called YalePay, and they\u2019ll give you a \u201crefund\u201d and you add your direct deposit information, request the $2000 and then it\u2019s deposited into your bank account. You can always call the Fin Aid office they\u2019re usually nice and helpful people :) Also feel free to send me a DM and I can answer any other questions you might have!",

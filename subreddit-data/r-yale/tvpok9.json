I would pick Yale, because I prefer New Haven to Palo Alto, Yale architecture to Stanford architecture, Yale dining to Stanford dining, and New Haven climate to Palo Alto climate (very hot take). You might hold the opposite opinions after visiting! Congrats on getting into two very fine schools.\n\nLast word of advice: don't worry about prestige at this stage. Instead, focus on where you want to spend the next four years of your life.\n\nBtw, I'm a Yalie whose dream school in high school was Stanford. Coincidentally, I know multiple Stanford alumni whose dream school was Yale. We have all ended up very happy with our college experiences :)",

Chose Yale because I wanted to \u201cget away / experience something new\u201d and still regret it 10+ years later. Would\u2019ve been happier to be closer to home. But if you\u2019re from the east coast then maybe Yale would be better.",

College isn\u2019t easy when you\u2019re so far away (both emotionally and logistically with move ins/outs, holiday breaks, etc). Over a decade later and yale still struggles getting its students proper mental health care (I\u2019m sure that\u2019s true of many schools though). My sister went to Stanford and enjoyed it. Palo alto and new haven are just very different places to live, and the schools sort of specialize in different things (sciences vs liberal arts).",

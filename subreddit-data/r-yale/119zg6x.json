    "postText": "Hi, I'll be coming to New Haven in the summer for an internship. They don't offer housing for this location, so I'll need to find it on my own. I was wondering if there were any apartments that offer summer leases (2 - 3 months) or any Yale students subleasing their apt. I'm looking for a 1x1 or 2x2 furnished apartment from June - August, preferably below $1200/month.",

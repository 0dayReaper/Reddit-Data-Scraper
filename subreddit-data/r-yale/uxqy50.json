    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI just finished bachelor's degrees in Comp Sci and Statistics from a T5-T10 public university in 3 yrs. \n\nI have the opportunity to complete an MS in Comp Sci at Yale, fully funded with a 24K annual stipend for 2 yrs.\n\nI think I like ML, but am not heartset on it. Most people at Amazon are telling me just to stay and go full time since a master's in CS supposedly adds little value especially since I have work authorization, but I would like to hear what you guys\nthink of:\n\n- The quality of upper division CS classes\n- The value of Yale on a CS resume\n- The ability of grad students to mingle with undergrads/socialize\n\nFeel free to share anything else! Non-CS people are surprised I am considering this and many think I am potentially turning down this exciting opportunity.\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Master\u2019s is not worth it\u2014only PhDs really open more doors. Just go to Amazon, it\u2019ll add enough clout to your resume to get interviews most places, and probably more value to recruiters than any degree by itself. Only doors Yale might open that Amazon won\u2019t are maybe roles in quant firms (typically recruit out of school rather than industry lateral, care about prestige, etc.).\n\nUpper division CS class quality is variable. Some real stars, a couple real stinkers, most somewhere in between. Grad students don\u2019t socialize much with undergrads, even though they share classes in CS.",

            "comment": "&gt;The quality of upper division CS classes\n\nVery hit or miss. There's a couple great profs, but in general, you'll find significantly more variety of upper division CS classes at a school with a larger CS program. This is not an issue for undergrad, but for a masters program focused on CS it will limit your breadth and growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The value of Yale on a CS resume\n\nFairly strong -- it's good enough to get you past a resume screen for nearly any job. But, a full-time job at Amazon is more significant signal for future employers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The ability of grad students to mingle with undergrads/socialize\n\nQuite limited. If you go in with the intention to mingle you probably can, but in my experience as a CS undergrad who took several upper division classes I don't think we knew any grad students well.\n\n\\-----\n\nFWIW many of my friends did the joint BS+MS ([link](https://dus.cs.yale.edu/bs+ms.html)) in computer science, those who did the MS have pretty much identical career paths and compensations so far (3-4 years out of graduation) as those who did not. If you think you'd like the program, go for it! But if you're doing it only for future job prospects I'd reconsider.",

            "comment": "Not convinced about the lack of value of a masters - for the colleges where data is available, you can see a considerable 30-40% increase in salary for undergrad vs masters. For the other questions:\n\nQuality of upper division classes: I generally haven't heard anything too worrying about most upper division classes, but I haven't took any.\n\nValue of Yale on a CS resume - Yale has a higher 3-year salary than Harvard, MIT and Stanford (according to [ed.gov](https://ed.gov)), and so I would say *pretty good*. I can't comment on how much of an improvement it is versus your current degree, but it certainly wouldn't be a reduction in value.\n\nSocialisation: I find grad students tend to socialise with each other, and undergrads with each other. There are many groups that feature both UGs + Grads, but most are seemingly dominated by one over the other. You'll have a perfectly strong social life, but I doubt it will involve too many undergrads tbh.",

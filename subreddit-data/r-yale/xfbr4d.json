    "postText": "I\u2019ve been seeing this guy, we\u2019ll call him Paul, for about 3 months regularly. He told me up front he was a psychiatrist but my best guy friend who is a also a psychiatrist when I told him how cool and chill he was and how well they\u2019d get along and told him about his film googled him he made a throwaway comment like, oh, he\u2019s a psychologist but cool.\n\nI kept that in the back of my brain thinking I must have misheard. I was a psych major myself many moons ago and I don\u2019t get them confused but my memory is iffy.\n\nI clarified with him when he was in town again a week or so later and he told me, yeah, he\u2019s a psychiatrist, not only that but also a medical doctor. He also does surgeries. This seemed weird to me but I know he\u2019s also screenwritten and produced a movie which I had googled and I\u2019d also listened to an episode of the podcast he does with a friend so I knew he was driven. He came across very intelligent. I had done basic googling but don\u2019t like to feel like I\u2019m investigating people so I don\u2019t do a lot because I\u2019m almost too good at internet research.\n\nWell. I should have done more.\n\nLast Friday before work something was bugging me, remembering what my best friend had said, \u201cOh, he\u2019s a psychologist.\u201d He had to have seen that somewhere. So I googled.\n\nSure enough he had posted just a few years ago that he was a psychologist. Down the hole I went with the help of my friend. It turns out, over the last few days did I realize not only is he not a psychiatrist, not a medical doctor, but not even a psychologist. He\u2019s a counselor.\n\nHe told me he was in and out of state on contract and that his ex-wife (who also had a traveling job) lived in Paris where he\u2019d go see the kids when he\u2019d finish up contracts. What his actual job is is a home health care service on care.com where they send people in as needed to homes. His wife is part owner of the company. I\u2019m willing to bet all the times he has been saying he\u2019s out of town he\u2019s been here.\n\nWhat\u2019s really wild though is that he is actually posting online that he\u2019s a psychologist where his NPI number clearly states his credentials that he\u2019s a counselor (not a psychologist) and he\u2019s using false credentials to try to get speaking gigs and who knows what other work which is horrifying (you know, in addition to cheating on his wife because I didn\u2019t  find divorce records for his county but did find out he took out a PPE loan for almost $7K for his business in early 2020 but that the LLC isn\u2019t active as of fall of 2020 despite still running the business). \ud83d\ude43\n\nHere\u2019s what I want to know and where I was hoping the Yale community could come in. He also claims to have gone to Yale and received his Doctorate there in 2012. It\u2019s *possible* of course but considering everything else it doesn\u2019t seem likely at this point.\n\nI won\u2019t actually be doing anything with the information because he knows where I live with my children and since he lied about all this who knows what kind of psychopath he truly is, but for my own closure I really just want to see if he really is lying about literally every single thing on his LinkedIn and business profiles.\n\nIf someone could reach out to me so you could look him up on an alumni database I would love to know. \n\nThis guy told me stories about being catfished and lied to on dates. I literally told him I had no interest in married and don\u2019t even date like that (I\u2019m solopoly). I just wanted a long term partner to share time with and I thought it was exactly what I was looking for. I didn\u2019t see him going anywhere. I didn\u2019t want his money, just his time, affection, and honesty. \n\nTIA! \n\n(Throwaway acct)",

Knowing how braggy he seems to be now about publicizing his accomplishments now it doesn\u2019t seem likely he\u2019d remove himself from the registry. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty safe to say this is yet another thing he\u2019s lying about. This is even on his LinkedIn. Lying psychopath. I clearly knew nothing about this person at all.",

I will be getting tested to be safe as well.\n\nI genuinely can\u2019t retaliate with anything I know since he knows where my children and I live. Except for maybe the LLC being Admin Dissolved in 10/2020 and the fact that he received a PPE loan that year for the business so he should be operating it. And I know he is operating it as a business because I\u2019ve seen the business vehicle and him in the polos. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I\u2019d have to dig more.

I told him I knew it based on his NPI number and said goodbye and immediately blocked him.\n\nIt was before learning the rest of this stuff. Initially I thought he was just trying to impress me by making his job seem more impressive. Now I\u2019m seeing it was so much more-that it wasn\u2019t just the job but wife/life and WHOLE background what he\u2019s been doing.\n\nWhat\u2019s frightening is that it\u2019s not just to me but to potential clients/employers-and it\u2019s working. He is also still advertising that he is operating under this LLC that\u2019s been dissolved for almost two years now.\n\nHonestly-if I could do something small that he couldn\u2019t trace back to me to tip off something just to send a little karma his way I will. Especially as now I\u2019m worried about potential STDs and whatever else he lied about.",

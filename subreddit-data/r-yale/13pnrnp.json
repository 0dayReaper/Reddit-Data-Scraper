    "postText": "i\u2019m a prefrosh and keep getting emails about ONEXYS. i\u2019ve been largely ignoring them because it seemed like something all prefrosh get but i read an email closer and it says based on the level of math credentials in my application that i\u2019m recommended to enroll. \n\ni don\u2019t feel like i\u2019m weak in math. i don\u2019t enjoy it by any means, but i took ap calc bc last year and passed with a 98 and a 5 on the ap exam. my SAT math was a 730, which i guess is low for yale, but not bad overall. i\u2019m from a more rural area that admittedly does not have the best education system, but my calc teacher was genuinely great and i feel alright about my math skills. \n\ni\u2019m planning on majoring in history or polisci but will be taking calc 1 &amp; 2 as well as physics for rotc. \n\nwill i struggle in calc/physics if i don\u2019t take ONEXYS? i physically cannot participate due to my rotc summer training schedule.",

            "comment": "You won't necessarily struggle in calc / physics if you don't join ONEXYS -- there will be tons of resources during the school year like office hours, peers/friends who take the class, professors to help you.\n\nONEXYS can only help you. ONEXYS is designed to be a program that helps with transition into college, particularly those who come from untraditional background. It's by no means a program for people \"weak in math,\" but one that helps level the playing field and allows you to meet awesome professors and upperclassmen who are excited about your success. Also, college classes are different than high school classes--a 98 in high school doesn't necessarily mean the same at Yale. Personally, I definitely overestimated my abilities and was not as prepared as I expected myself to be. ONEXYS would've been an awesome opportunity for me if I had been selected. \n\nI know some of the TAs and professors who put this program together, and honestly, it sounds like an enjoyable and supportive experience. Even though you probably cannot participate due to scheduling, I would say it's worth reaching out to the director of the program (or any point of contact) and ask about suggestions / other things to do, etc.",

            "comment": "It's fucking horrible. They lost my laundry or failed to deliver it on time so many times. I've waited weeks. Even getting the bag was an issue for me. It's ridiculously expensive and a horrible deal. I had situations where it took more than a week and a half to get my clothes. I had a big build up of laundry as you might expect. But be careful, putting in two loads in one calander week will charge you extra. Customer service is non existent, and there's nothing you can do. Locations are if your not in old campus. Even then, the regular laundry machines are in the next room. They don't operate on any breaks for weeks at a time. They've put regular clothing items of mine  through the dry cleaning they offer ( which my plan didn't cover) and then charged me for it because it wasn't in my plan. I literally can't think of one thing I was happy with. Genuinely shitty product. \n\n\nYou will save time and money, despite their claims of it saving time.",

    "postText": "For any STEM people at Yale, I was wondering how much organic chemistry knowledge is required in the Principles of Biochemistry I class, MB&amp;B 300. I am thinking about going abroad my Junior Fall, and I would have to take CHEM 220 and MB&amp;B 300 concurrently to have a shot at completing MB&amp;B as my major. Any advice?",

            "comment": "Other poster answered your question pretty well. I\u2019m an MB&amp;B major who just graduated. You could probably study up on the few things you do need to know \u2014 I might try to also know the basics of SN1/SN2 type reactions \u2014 which wouldn\u2019t be too hard. However, taking both those classes at the same time would absolutely suck so just be aware of that. When are you planning on taking physics? If possible, I would try to prioritize taking orgo first and then try to do physics and MB&amp;B 300 at the same time \u2014 which would also suck, but at least you won\u2019t be trying to self-study orgo at the same time.",

However, i am also considering taking PHYS 180/181 as a sophomore and then biochem as a junior. Both paths don't sound great, though.",

It\u2019s nice to finish the major classes early, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth struggling through biochem without orgo first. If you do biochem as a junior it still gives you plenty of time to take other classes senior year \u2014 all I did in my spring semester related to my major was the MB&amp;B thesis, and took a bunch of other random classes.",

That said, they are graded pretty generously and most of the grade is midterm and final so don\u2019t worry too much about finishing every pset. It\u2019s just a hard class no real way around it. There\u2019s also a generous curve. I got a 50% on the final when the average was like a 75% and I ended up with the B+.",

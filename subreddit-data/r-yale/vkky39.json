I guess as a first-year you\u2019ll likely be housed in Welch, which is definitely among the better dorms on Old Campus.\n\nI guess I\u2019ll also make a larger point here since I\u2019ve seen a lot of these types of posts (this is less directed towards OP and more towards any prefrosh who happen to be scanning this), but most colleges are far more similar than they are different. This is especially true for first-years since most don\u2019t even live in their college and there aren\u2019t the slight demographic shifts that happen with upperclassmen due to transfers (athletes transferring to Morse/Stiles, for example). The strength of the residential college system is mostly in the fact *that* you have a community to fall back on, not as much about which particular one it is. Some have better facilities and more active college councils but unless you just don\u2019t really vibe with the people in your college, your experience will be 90% similar regardless of which one you end up in.",

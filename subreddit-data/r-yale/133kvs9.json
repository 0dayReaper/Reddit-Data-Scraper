    "postText": "Hi everyone! The Housing, Advising, and Camp Yale forms will be available tomorrow, so I wanted to ask current students a few questions:\n\n1. Did you like your housing situation the first year? I imagine it must have been tough for the Class of 2025 because of the abnormally large class size, but what about others?\n2. Is there anything that you wish you mentioned on the housing form that would have improved your living experience?\n3. I know it's supposed to be completely random unlike at places like Columbia and Penn where you can choose where to live, but can you say anything about what colleges you like in the Housing Form or will it reflect negatively? For example, I absolutely love the new colleges (or even the Eero Saarinen colleges that get so much hate) but I can say that in the form?\n4. The website says it takes 30 minutes to fill up, so it's definitely more than just an intro and sleeping/cleaning habits and music taste. What other things does the housing form ask?\n5. I was pretty set on FOOT for Camp Yale, but as a low-income international student who will be traveling outside of their country for the first time I'm leaning more towards OIS now. If there are internationals reading this, how was your FOOT/OIS experience? Which one would you recommend?\n\nAlso I researched all the housing stuff and jotted down the following residential college to Old Campus dorm assignments:\n\nLDub - Berkeley, Pierson\n\nDurfee - Morse\n\nFarnam - JE\n\nLawrance - Stiles\n\nWelch - Davenport\n\nBingham - Hopper, Trumbull\n\nVanderbilt - Branford, Saybrook\n\nOwn college - Silliman, TD, Franklin, Murray\n\nDid I get it right? Are any of the other Old Campus dorms as bad as LDub (I know they redeem themselves with upperclassmen housing, but I think the shoe-box rooms and bunk-bed situation for first-years is unacceptable for a place like Yale)?",

            "comment": "Hi, class of 2026 here! \n1.) I was paired with 5 other roommates. We got insanely lucky and were put into a suite with 6 single bedrooms. Tbh, I love my room and suite situation. I honestly couldn\u2019t have asked for a better set up. \n2.) I would\u2019ve mentioned my anxiety and habits associated with that, but it ended up not mattering since I got a single. Mention any and everything that you think may affect your potential roommate. \n3.) You\u2019re placed in whichever college is chosen for you based on your overall \u201cpersonality\u201d on paper. As far as I\u2019m aware, I don\u2019t think mentioning specific colleges you\u2019d prefer would do very much. \n4.) I don\u2019t remember specifics, but I know the form also asks if you\u2019d be okay with a mixed-gender suite or would prefer a single-gender suite. I think there were also a few questions about religious practices and other habits. \n5.) I can\u2019t really comment on either FOOT or OIS. Just know that, for FOOT and HARVEST, you can\u2019t shower for 3 or so days haha. I did FOCUS and I loved it. All the programs are super fun, though!\n\nI\u2019m in Stiles, so my roommates and I are in Lawrance Hall. Our singles are approximately 6\u2019x10\u2019 and we have a pretty sizable common room. I\u2019m pretty unfamiliar with the rooms in other buildings, but everyone in my suite has a large space above the door for storage in addition to provided shelving. I honestly did not expect the lack of air conditioning in the residential buildings, but I\u2019m from the south where it\u2019s absolutely unheard of for a building to not have AC. It\u2019s hot for the first few weeks, so prepare for that!",

            "comment": "1.\tI\u2019m in Murray and love it. Spacious rooms with the most amenities and I\u2019m with a suite that really fits me. There are some downsides though like the famous Murray hike to Old Campus and the fact that Murray is more isolated and tight-knit as a result of its distance. This means it\u2019s generally more difficult to connect with most first-years since you\u2019re on completely opposite sides of campus, but it\u2019s definitely possible, just means you\u2019ll have to put in more effort. \n2.\tMy advice is be as honest as possible. I believe it\u2019s your college dean who matches people for suites, so they know very little about you. You have to put down what you want. \n3.\tIt is genuinely completely random unless you have legacy. \n4.\tI remember it asking what kind of suite environment you want (party suite, study suite, etc.), things about allergies and whether you\u2019re willing to live with others who have them, and a bunch of questions about you like personality, where you stand academically, prospective major, hobbies, what you\u2019re worried about coming to Yale, etc. \n5.\tI\u2019m not international but the people I know who did FOOT had a great experience and got to make a lot of friends through it (I did FOCUS). \n6.\tYes, that is correct although I\u2019ve heard Durfee has a little bit of Pierson as well (can\u2019t confirm myself). I know people living in LDub and it\u2019s really not THAT bad. But yes, it\u2019s generally considered the worst.",

            "comment": "hi! great questions! I'll try to help. \n\n\n1) I thought the physical housing was great - big suite with a big common room, nice bathrooms, decent size bedroom, and super cool suite style in general. I was on old campus (non l dub). In terms of people, I think a lot of people had some sort of issue with their suite group, but I feel like that's inevitable given the randomness of at all. Some suites clicked perfectly though. It's hard to predict. \n\n2) maybe just include more personality traits and don't try to downplay introvertedness. I wish I would've been placed with a quieter, nerdier, and artsier suite, but I think I answered questions too idealistically and overemphasized how outgoing I was. I don't really know how they put suites together though! Definitely include info on sleeping habits and preferences \n\n3. Nope, it's all randomized unless you had a sibling or parent attend here. They're all super great, seriously. You'll have pretty much the same yale experience regardless of your college, and living on old campus vs in your college directly is about equal in terms of the pros/cons of each \n\n the architecture really is a non factor since you'll be able to find pretty views anywhere on campus. \n\n4) I think it was sleeping, living habits, drugs/smoking etc, personality traits, and a few longer questions that also get sent to your academic advisor and froco, like \"what are you most nervous for\" \"what can we do to help you transition to college\" etc",

It gives you so much freedom, every course in Yale is available to you, and only two are mandatory. YSoA is a small school, so you get the opportunity to know everyone pretty fast. I can\u2019t recommend enough.",

            "comment": "Just started MArch II with u/nudles18  \n\nThe program is very open to customize to your own research interests, especially the MArch II program, which ends with a thesis semester.  I\u2019m loving it so far.  There is a very strong teamwork vibe here, everyone is friendly and helps each other out, there is very little competition culture if any.  Very active social events and lectures every week, which makes it easy to make friends.  Bonus is travel week, every advanced studio (3rd year March I and all March II studios) go on a week long visit to the site for their studio, airfare and accommodations payed for by the school.  There is a short summer travel program/elective over the summer which is the same, airfare and accommodations covered.  Facilities are largely great, Rudolph Hall is an amazing building and the studio spaces are beautiful, everyone gets a computer desk and a model making desk.\n\nPicking studio for advanced studios and electives was stressful, both use a different lottery system with different rules both involving ranked choice. A decent amount of people will not get their first choice studio or elective courses (although most people I know did get their first choice studio)\n\nGranted, I\u2019ve only been here for 2 months so still in the honeymoon phase.  I\u2019m sure after 2 years I\u2019ll have some more gripes.",

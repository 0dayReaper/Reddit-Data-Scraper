But as a lifelong gamer, one of the best decisions I made was to not bring my Xbox 360 to my dorm in the first semester of my undergrad college. It really freed up time to socialize and meet my dorm mates. Second semester I brought it to our common room and played social games. Subsequent years saw me move it to my room, but by then I already had an established social scene. Food for thought.",

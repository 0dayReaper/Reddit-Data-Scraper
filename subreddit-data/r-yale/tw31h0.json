I\u2019m considering Arabic, French, Spanish, and Japanese. I\u2019m arab myself so I know quite a bit but I would like to master the language. I know a fair bit of spanish after taking up to AP Spanish but I\u2019m definitely far from spanish. The other two languages I have no experience with. Can anyone comment on the classes in any of these four and if its possible to take two? Thanks!!! :)",

French/spanish tend to be on the higher workload side compared to japanese/arabic of the same lvl. You usually can't take 2 L1 languages at the same time because most of them happen during the same time slots. You could get lucky and find a 9:30 french and a 10:30 japanese or something along those lines though",

I have friends in Japan who I speak to in the language and feel comfortable with it. This is a testament to how good and supportive Yale's Japanese department is.\n\nThe faculty is amazing and will make sure you learn. There's also the Light Fellowship, which will fully fund travel to Japan for Japanese study. This is what really helped bring my Japanese to the next level!\n\nIf you have the slightest interest in Japanese, I'd recommend it. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions.",

            "comment": "I graduated in 2000, so my experience is somewhat out of date \u2013 but I learned French and Italian from scratch as an undergrad. I took intensive French \u2013 the equivalent of 2 years in 1 \u2013 my first year, and intensive Italian \\*and\\* third-year French in my second year. After that I stopped taking French courses and focused on third-year Italian and advanced Italian literature seminars, but my base in French turned out to be solid enough to do the Bryn Mawr summer program in Avignon while I was in grad school, and eventually to take a post-doc in Geneva.\n\nIt helped a lot that I had had Spanish through AP 5, but what really made it possible for me to do well was that I was EXTREMELY motivated to learn the languages, and thus prepared to get up for the early-morning classes, to put in the time to do the hours of homework and not fall behind, and to accept the trade-offs of an inflexible schedule that affected my choice of other courses and the effect on my weeknight social life. (I still had plenty of time for friends and extracurriculars! But if you like to hang out or party every night, or if you want to take on something that will require frequent evening rehearsals, this may not be the schedule for you.)\n\nIf you want to take two languages at the same time, my advice to you is to have a very clear sense of why you're learning each one. Having clear goals that you can remind yourself of when the workload gets heavy will help you keep working steadily. And working steadily is necessary, because language learning requires constant practice; you really can't slack off and then catch up later.\n\nIf you want to stagger your languages, on the other hand, you might find it easier. With your background I imagine that it might be easier for you to start with whatever level of Spanish you place into (because you'll be surprised how quickly high school languages fade away if you don't use them, especially if you start working on another language instead), go far enough with that to accomplish a goal, and then either switch over to Arabic (where again you might place into a more advanced class) or focus on Arabic but take a Spanish lit class now and again.\n\nIn any case, motivation is key to language learning! So think about why you want to learn the various languages that interest you, and pursue the languages for which you'll get out of bed to attend class at 8:30 when it's snowing and do the homework for before hanging out with your friends.\n\nCongratulations, and good luck!",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t know anything about these classes specifically, but it\u2019s possible to get through two different languages in your four years. I got to L3 German and then started over again with L1 ASL because I really wanted to learn more than one language. They take a lot of time out of your schedule though, so if you\u2019re looking at STEM/More involved majors, you might just not find the space for multiple language courses. \nLanguage classes are M-F, and there are only 3 times of day they typically run (9:25, 10:30, 11:35), so doing two at once would be hard to arrange and I would not recommend it (that would also put you at 3 credits when 4-4.5 credits is a typical semester load)",

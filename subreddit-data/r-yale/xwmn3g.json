Not trying to be rude. \n\nIt\u2019s not like Yale to do something like that.\n\nIf want to know more about Yale in the spring and I\u2019m in Lviv or Kyiv lmk we can lowkey talk, I don\u2019t publicize that I\u2019m there fighting (\u201cin my head\u201d Yale doesn\u2019t like that)",

I was thinking about writing about my experience living under occupation (not a sob story), moments of leadership and strategy.\nThanks!",

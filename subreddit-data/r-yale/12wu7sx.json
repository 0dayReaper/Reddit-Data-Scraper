            "comment": "I always hated and still hate how allergic some Yalies and Yale are about money and more specifically earning money. Yale undergraduate really doesn\u2019t prepare you to land a decent job. Yeah I get it \u2014 Yale isn\u2019t a trade school and it\u2019s suppose to enlighten us with an education. But once we graduate, we are left with \u201cwell now what?\u201d. Nearly all my friends ended up needing graduate school or professional school education to have a decent career. Is it such a bad thing to have a decent career? I feel like this part of the culture is a legacy of well.. legacies, ie. people who don\u2019t have to nor ever had to worry about money. However, that seems increasingly out of tune with the Yale demographic trends. Also, Yale sure ain\u2019t shy about asking for alum\u2019s money, which some of us can afford to give because we fought hard after graduation to get those well paying careers. Lastly Yale was a beneficiary of the Harkness fortune which is oil money earned through a lot of ruthlessness. It sometimes feels like being born into money is OK but working for money isn\u2019t. This was at least my experience as a first generation college student at Yale.",

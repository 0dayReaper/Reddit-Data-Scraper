    "postText": "So I pretty much did not see this one coming. I took my exam and I thought I had the test down and everything. But the grade came in to be a failing grade. \n\nNot a pleasant way to start off my weekend, and now all I can think about is the grade. It's a big part of my final grade so if I don't get perfect scores on my next two tests (which is highly improbable), I won't be able to end up with an A / A- in the class, and I feel...hopeless. \n\nIt's also what I wanted to major in so now I'm doubting if I should even major in it if I failed the first exam of the seemingly most introductory course for the major. \n\nI know I may sound like dramatic and whiny, but this is the first time it's ever happened to me, so I don't even know how I'm supposed to cope. Is having a B in a major class okay? Should I change my major and just credit d/fail this class so that I don't have a less-than-perfect gpa? Am I gonna be able to go to grad school with this kind of gpa? I feel hopeless and even more depressed (the weather is not helping either...) \n\nI guess the point of this post is to see if there is a light at the end of the tunnel, if anyone else has gone through this and recovered, please share.",

Figure out what you did wrong, talk to your professor, take advantage of the dozens of resources available to you, and do better next time. It's not the end of the world and if you do get a B, so what? No one cares about a B.",

I remember calling my mom and being like \u201cI have to drop the class. I have to change my major. This is terrible. Etc\u201d.  \n\nIT\u2019S GOING TO BE OKAY. I promise.  \n\nGo talk to your professor one on one. Send them an email and ask when you can come in. Be honest that you thought you nailed it and actually ended up failing. Ask them how you can improve. Tell them you\u2019re considering dropping the class and ask if they think that would be for the best. My professors practically begged me to not drop the class.  \n\nTalk to your Dean (and your FroCo if applicable) and tell them how you\u2019re feeling. They can help you cope with some of the stress of adjusting to Yale.  \n\nIT\u2019S GOING TO BE OKAY",

It\u2019s totally normal to get a bad grade or two while you\u2019re adjusting to academics at an elite college.

I also did rather meh in my intro major classes (B/B-). \n\nI\u2019d say what you should focus on is what went wrong and figuring out a plan for getting a better grade on the next test whether it\u2019s now knowing how one should study, going to office hours, or going to peer tutoring. If you aren\u2019t sure, talk with the prof. Most want the best of their students. \n\nAs per your major, the question you should be asking is do you enjoy the material and the classes. If the major is tough and okay grades really unsettle you, then maybe you could consider changing but I think the focus shouldn\u2019t be on grades. If grad schools is part of the plan for the future, gpa matters a bit but so much more will matter, too. Also if grades trend up, they aren\u2019t going to care about your poor grade in one intro class.\n\nPart of transitioning to Yale is getting use to the idea that you are taking challenging classes and everyone around are freaking smart just like you. A cliche which I think is true is that the only A that matters is between the Y and the L.",

People take a while to adjust to college and it's not abnormal to see some people getting pretty bad grades freshman fall and then go on to do really well.",

As you approach the next exam go in some more and make sure you've got the major concepts down. \n\nGenerally though try not to worry so much. I know it feels bad to get a bad grade but you surely shouldn't let one test force you out of a major. Ultimately when you're out getting a job people are going to see that you went to Yale and that'll be enough. \n\nDon't forget about all the resources and advisors you can speak with. They can really be a help. Go easy on yourself, get some sleep and exercise, and keep working hard!",

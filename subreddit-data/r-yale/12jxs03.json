I\u2019ve already visited both in the past and am leaning heavily towards Duke because I envision myself there the most, but I wanted to hear other perspectives about Yale before I say no to Yale. What are the best and worst parts about Yale\u2019s community? How have your experiences been with economics, polisci, and EVST?\n\nA distant third is Penn (not Wharton) but I\u2019m not as interested in their environment. I technically haven\u2019t said no yet though. Thanks!",

The connections you get from Yale are definitely better than Duke when it comes to anything politically-oriente, and it\u2019ll set you up for think tanks, public sector work, and private sector orgs as well. as shitty as it sounds, the Yale name carries so much more weight than Duke",

            "comment": "Do you have a sense of what your career goals are? For most paths involving econ / poli sci / evst, I think there are fairly concrete advantages (i.e. not \"it's more prestigious\") to attending Yale over Duke, but the extent of these advantages will depend a lot on what you want to do.\n\nFor instance, Yale has much stronger law placement / resources than Duke, in part because it's very easy to interface with the law school and various policy programs (ex. at the Jackson School for Global Affairs, or the Institute for Social and Policy Studies) as an undergrad. If you think you may want to pursue your interests via law in the future (ex. by doing environmental policy), I think Yale will give you a genuinely substantial leg up over Duke. At each of the top 3 law schools (Y/S/H), there's between 3-9x more Yale students than Duke students, which doesn't just reflect differences in student interest -- the law ecosystem here is just really hard to beat.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, if you want to work in finance / make money after graduation, going to Yale will help with getting a small set of elite jobs (private equity), but you'll have plenty of strong opportunities at Duke as well. \n\n(In the middle are PhD programs / non-law grad school -- Yale's stronger department rankings will matter here, and it's incredibly easy to research with one or multiple professors as early as your first year, but the advantages are overall less drastic than for law).\n\nThere are some career paths I've omitted in the above, but hopefully that gives you an idea for the general landscape. As for the community: I found Yalies to be incredibly collaborative, kind, and friendly. People are smart but rarely wear it on their sleeves. Students are also artsier / more humanities-oriented on aggregate than at similar colleges, which I thought added a lot of variety and enjoyment to my life as a STEM major. It is true that Yalies care much less about sports / sports-based school spirit than Duke students, which could be a major con if that's part of what you want in a college experience.",

I would prefer to have a more Econ-focused degree and get a job after graduating with a path forward that isn\u2019t dependent on grad school (not sure if that\u2019s realistic).\n\nI\u2019m not 100% sure on the types of jobs I want but think tanks, economic research, maybe impact investing from within the finance realm could be interesting but I have to do more research on it! \n\nI\u2019m certainly interested in getting involved in economic and/or political research wherever I go so thanks for sharing some of the resources.\n\nI definitely like school spirit that sports will provide but I know Yale\u2019s residential colleges will also provide their own form of spirit and community so there\u2019s certainly things to look forward to on both ends!

Google the \u2018our scholars\u2019 or \u2018experts\u2019 pages for the American Enterprise Institute or Brookings (top think tanks on opposite political ends) \u2014 everyone has an education section, and it\u2019s almost all PhDs or JDs, especially as you move up in seniority. \n\nWith that said, of course many people have interesting and successful careers without grad school \u2014 it just requires more effort. Of the three examples you provided, I\u2019d say impact investing is the most likely to be achievable at a high level with just an undergrad degree (MBAs might matter somewhat though). Econ research full time (ex. at the Federal Reserve) is extremely hard without a PhD; your career will be hard capped relative to those that have one. At think tanks, \u2018hard capped\u2019 is clearly less true, but the pages I suggested probably speak for themselves.\n\nI want to end by saying that Duke is phenomenal, so if your heart is screaming Duke, you absolutely shouldn\u2019t feel bad about picking it. You\u2019ll have good outcomes from either place. I do think Yale will make obtaining a fair number of those outcomes easier, and it\u2019s up to you to place a value on that. Good luck, and don\u2019t hesitate to ask more questions, either via comment or pm.",

Just want to inform you it\u2019s a pretty clout-driven field\u2014most top 20 school tenure-track professors went to a top 5 PhD for example. Duke is a strong brand (top 20 econ phd), but Yale is definitely T10/borderline T5. This name difference is important when it comes to getting into top think tanks (Brookings, Urban, etc.) or pre-doctoral fellowships at top 5 schools/research institutions like Opportunity Insights or the NY Fed.\n\nAlso totally fine if you don\u2019t want to do Econ PhD since it takes 5-7 years as of late, but just FYI advancing in a social science research career is pretty dependent on getting a PhD.\n\nOverall you\u2019ll be doing great professionally at either school as you already understand. But there could easily be a material improvement in your opportunities at Yale as compared to Duke. Hope this helps!\n\nE: didn\u2019t see responder below but (s)he makes a lot of great points.",

Not planning on academia either, but think tanks sound interesting so I\u2019m glad you mentioned it could be difficult to stay in/advance without a PhD, definitely something to think about. For me it\u2019s mostly a tradeoff of quality of life advantages I find at Duke (weather, year-round outdoor activities, school spirit) versus some of the opportunities (like the Tobin center) that you and others have mentioned. Of course Duke also has great offerings for undergrads interested in econ and policy from a research perspective, but this is the Yale sub so no point in rehashing them. Is the difference primarily that I\u2019d have to do a little better/try a little harder at Duke for the same outcome (i.e. getting a 3.9 at Duke instead of a 3.8 at Yale)? I\u2019m thinking because I\u2019d be happier at Duke my performance would be better as a result, and I could wind up with essentially the same opportunities?",

Honestly, I doubt there is a noticeable difference in course rigor between the two schools that would make your Duke GPA better than your Yale GPA. But obviously only someone who had transferred from one to the other could speak on that with much accuracy. More importantly, I would say that a Yale candidate for a Brookings internship with a 3.6 might even have good of a shot as a Duke candidate with a 3.85 for the same internship (all else equal, which it never is).\n\nThe best advice I can offer you is to **think about some potential target employers if you stick on this path**, such as: NY Fed, Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Boston Fed, \\[DOJ Antitrust Economic Analysis Group\\]([https://www.justice.gov/atr/about-division/economic-analysis-group](https://www.justice.gov/atr/about-division/economic-analysis-group)), \\[CBO Economic Analysis\\]([https://www.cbo.gov/about/careers/days](https://www.cbo.gov/about/careers/days)), \\[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\\]([https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/careers/students-and-graduates/](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/careers/students-and-graduates/)), or Brookings/Urban/(god forbid) AEI like mentioned above. Go on LinkedIn, type either nothing or the job title you want in the search bar, hit enter, then filter by current company and type in the above companies one by one. **See where people with the jobs you want went to school.** This should give you a sense as to how you might do recruiting for your ideal employers from a Duke/Vanderbilt/Northwestern vs a Harvard/Yale/Princeton.\n\nLastly, I would **consider the possibility that you DO end up wanting to do something that prestige makes easier to break into**. E.g. Management Consulting (MBB), while certainly accessible from both schools, will be much easier (even bordering on not-that-bad) to break into from Yale. Private equity and other buy side finance will be near-impossible to break into from Duke, but quite possible from Yale. While this may seem meaningless now, career goals change for a lot of people. I had the exact same hope as you toward the end of my freshman year of college: do research without needing a PhD. I ended up changing my plan to doing an econ PhD, tried academic research for  a summer, didn't like it enough, and am now applying empirical social science research skills at a more quant-y consulting job. And my career trajectory has honestly been pretty stable compared to a lot of people I know.\n\n**Now with ALL of that being said, your lifestyle concerns especially with respect to the weather/school spirit are very valid, and you wouldn't be doing yourself a disservice picking Duke.**",

The biggest (or close to it) athletic department. Besides people who want to work in the industry, some people just think that\u2019s a really nice perk for a college and want tk be around that community.

I brought it up because it was obvious you\u2019re not a big sports fan because you asked it. A baseball fan would know the answer. \n\nThe outcomes for yale college and duke college are virtually identical. Duke has better med placement, yale has better law placement etc. Duke statistics is better, Yale English is better. The vast majority is a wash and it doesn\u2019t really affect undergrads. Saying it\u2019s absurd to choose yale is\u2026 absurd. Poli sci departments are peers and (although yale is ranked higher in econ, it is not an Econ powerhouse and it\u2019s rise in the rankings is extremely new). There is literally no meaningful difference in outcome. Just look at the stats. \n\nSports being the only reason may be dumb. But the weather is a lot better. Durham is unquestionably better than New Haven. School spirit is much stronger at duke, and there\u2019s a better community at Duke (again, largely because of sports). These are things at the margin, but again, they matter, because, again, there is basically no difference in outcome among the colleges. You can say this or that, but the data doesn\u2019t lie. \n\nYour analogy should be \u201cyou can date two equal girls, but one is closer to Boston which you prefer\u201d. What you\u2019re saying doesn\u2019t even make sense. Some people prefer prioritizing their mental health and school community over a tiny difference in academic rankings. That\u2019s perfectly valid, as unless you want to be an academic (and even then), there is literally no difference between the 10th poli sci department and the 8th poli sci department. Idk what your definition of absurd is, but you can\u2019t mean absurdity of outcome.\n\n\nOne thing that\u2019s great about duke is a lot of the prestige obsessed and shallow people don\u2019t go there. Those students choose ivies. You seem like those people judging how many elite college subs you\u2019re active in. Youre obsessed with what other people think about you and that\u2019s it. Duke self selects for students who are elite academically but also value fun and are willing to sacrifice a bit of lay prestige. That\u2019s very valid.",

I went to MIT and its not the same as my brother who's at princeton. there is something special about going to HYP. you immediately become part of the social elite. an adjacent to the old, new england establishment. the network in econ and poly sci is absurd. its stupidly easy to get into any law school and private equity firm from Yale. \n\ni think i just value being part of this elite. its something money can't buy. \n\nThe Boston Globe wrote that \"if there's one school that can lay claim to educating the nation's top national leaders over the past three decades, it's Yale\". Yale alumni were represented on the Democratic or Republican ticket in every U.S. presidential election between 1972 and 2004. immediately becoming part of this elite alumni network carries with you throughout life. it truly gives you blue, elite, blood and is something money can't buy. \n\nyale is still a huge creator of income disparity in America. its sad that Yale and peer institutions haven't increased the total number of students they accept because they want to maintain the privilege of attending the school. even today, 50% of the people at yale had some sort of connect to get in (feeder boarding school like phillips andover, legacy, wealthy+white+educated parents). getting accepted if you're not in this group is truly special and i personally think that the marginal \"happiness\" benefit from fitting in at duke should be overlooked. \n\nhowever, you are right in that it really is just what you use to determine your utility function.",

If bigger athletic school culture and good weather is important to you, Duke is a great choice. If you lean more academic and see yourself in the northeast/west coast or internationally the future, Yale will open more doors. It also has a great residential college system and collaborative culture. It really depends on your personal and professional goals, but the actual academic differences at the undergraduate level are not that great among any of the T10 schools.",

And you\u2019re right the alumni networks are both incredibly strong, with Yale having a slight network advantage (whether we like it or or not, ivy league alumni have unique respect for each other, especially hyp(sm)). Don\u2019t get me wrong, Duke will not hold you back, you just might need to push a wee bit harder opening certain doors in certain industries (and other doors in the Duke network will swing more freely). I also think you will find some significant differences in campus culture, influenced by geography (warm southern vs. more \u201cseasonal\u201d northeast) and more importantly by how people socialize within each community. Duke\u2019s Greek system is more central to campus life, but apparently this is changing so that more students are independent and frats/sororities are less socially influential. Social life at Yale centers around its residential colleges. Frats/sororities are minor influences among the many affinity/interest groups/societies that Yale is known for.",

            "comment": "First off, residential colleges are quite different from dorms. Old Campus living is almost identical to dorm life, which makes moving into your college that much better. \n\nTrumbull College has historically had a warm, close-knit environment. The amenities are solid, too (three courtyards, an art studio, a pottery studio, a kitchen separate from the Buttery, a theater, a dance studio, an art gallery, a music practice room, a gym, etc.). Trumbull has typically had one of the better dining halls on campus. Senior and junior year housing is exceptional if you get a good spot in the draw. \n\nBerkeley is synonymous with Thunder Brunch. Huge plus there. The split design is neat and it\u2019s a great college to live in if you like to lounge on Cross Campus. \n\nHopper has been working to reinvent itself post-renaming. Formerly, it was an okay/decent college with a meh dining hall. That said, the basement is quite neat and the suites that I\u2019ve been in had average or better natural light in the warmer months. \n\nTL;DR: I\u2019d choose Trumbull or Berkeley over Hopper, but all of the Cross Campus colleges have their merits.",

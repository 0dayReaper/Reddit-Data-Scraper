            "comment": "yes!! i did yygs 2022 PLE and i was really worried that it was going to be boring, time consuming, etc., but it ended up being a really amazing experience. i was online due to the covid restrictions, but it didn't really limit anything. they make it clear that yygs is not a sign or boost for yale admission, but i really do think that doing yygs is a solid indication of serious interest in yale and does help you out in the extracurricular department. yygs is based on your indicated track/interest and there are seminars, lectures, family times, and discussions centered around that interest. lectures are lead by individuals with a notable career and interest in that given field (for example, one of my ple lectures was with daniel matkovits who is a really big deal at yale law), and discussions are held with your small family group after lectures are finished. lectures are also with everyone in your track (ple, ist, sgc, or lpc). with seminars, yygs offers you a variety if topics to choose from, and you just learn about that specific topic with about 15-25 other students. (a seminar i attended was \"lashes for punishment? an introduction to the multiculturalism debate). additionally, a family time group and instructor is assigned to you the fist day and you continue to meet with them throughout the whole experience. family groups are amazing and i'm still in contact with all of mine. the last thing (that i didn't really mention earlier) is the simulation group project. yale targets a worldly issue and challenges yygs student to address this issue. they group you with students from other tracks (ple, ist, sgc, lpc) and you work together to find a realistic and applicable solution to a problem within that worldly issue. (ex: our issue was adapting the world to life after the pandemic. my group had two people from brazil and two from the united states, so we discussed the issues of homelessness in both areas and addressed how you could aid homeless people. our website is [atpa](https://afterthepandemicaid.carrd.co) ). i genuinely enjoyed everything about the experience except for the select few people who acted like yygs was a straight shot to yale and took things way too seriously. i would like to add, though, that i really do think yygs aided my application to yale and made it apparent to yale that i was interested in not only what they had to offer, but what i had to offer as well. i went on to get my yygs ambassadorship and i was just accepted early action for yale 27'. i say yygs is 100% worth it and a fun experience. pm me if you want more info or have other questions!! good luck &lt;3",

Your experience with yygs sounds amazing and congrats on the acceptance to yale!! \n\nI'm finishing off my application over the holidays but was just getting kind of demotivated because I realised I actually had no idea what I was putting in all the work for, but your positive experience is reassuring - going to put some more work in now!",

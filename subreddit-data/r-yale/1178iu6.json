Mine are elementary-age, so if you have advice on best school districts in relation to Yale campus, please share. Thank you!",

Plenty of families, professors, and Yale students live in East Rock as it\u2019s a safe and quiet area with family homes. Hope this helps!",

Nice area, walkable to main campuses and good neighbors. Halloween is a blast and the most American thing this Scottish guy ever experienced!",

Kind of far from cheap groceries so a car would be helpful, but basically no metro new haven grocery stores are any good\u2014there\u2019s a Trader Joe\u2019s in orange and a wal mart and BJs in North Haven (decently close to East Rock). Some decent shopping in East Rock, lots of Italian delis such as Nica\u2019s Market.\n\nI\u2019m a student so unsure about school districts, sorry!",

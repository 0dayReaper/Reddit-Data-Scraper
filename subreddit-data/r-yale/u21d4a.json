    "postText": "Hi, I read on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/96cuw5/biology_101104_placement/) that the biology placement tests had inflated difficulty and were extremely difficult to pass. I was wondering if anyone had tried to take it recently and if this was still the case. Thanks.",

            "comment": "So I think that is still the case, although I didn't take them personally. But I also want to add that if you are a bio major taking the intro bio sequence isn't a waste of time. You learn more than whatever your high school bio experience was, but also it's not just content. They teach you about essential experimental techniques that are going to show up in every bio class you take after that, and you learn how to read primary scientific literature in a specific way that every class after that expects you to know how to do as well. Also they teach you the grant proposal format that you also have to know if you want to do research. So even though yes they can be boring and dry and annoying at times I still think taking them is worth it. Will they be your favorite class? No. But also won't be a complete waste of time.",

            "comment": "It's not uncommon to pass one or two of the placement tests -- this is probably the modal outcome for a student that was very strong in AP Bio or participated in biology olympiad -- but effectively nobody ever passes all four. This is probably a good thing, even if annoying, for the reasons the other commenter highlighted.",

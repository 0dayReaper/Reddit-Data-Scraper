I\u2019m not used to first dates being dinners and always the guy paying and so on, as it would often be in movies, TV, and so on. Would it be expected of me when dating at Yale that? Or perhaps instead, what would be expected of me, as a guy dating at here?",

That said, dinner is usually a bit much for a first date usually, its coffee or drinks, or going somewhere public that's interesting. You should probably plan on paying or at least offering to. It's generally polite if you asked them on a date to pay for said date. But overall keep it chill, so way down from what is in movies. A first date is more of a test run see if you get along on that level.",

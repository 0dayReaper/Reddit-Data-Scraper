Does anyone have experience with care from Yale Health (or any other providers that accept the insurance), particularly the insurance/payment aspect for care such as HRT or hair removal, particularly for a trans woman? Have things been covered well? Have you had to fight for coverage? And how have copays been on medication/certain procedures?\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Hi! I\u2019m a trans girl and a Yale student as well. If you are on student insurance, Yale covers all gender-affirming care (there\u2019s a copay for some). They are informed consent now, which means that you just have to call Yale endocrinology (specialty services 203-432-0335), say that you are trans and interested in starting HRT, and they will schedule an appointment for you. There\u2019s a copay for HRT; in my case (I do injections), it costs me $~70 dollars (with all the material included), but since the needles/injections last forever, you just have to buy the t blocker and estradiol regularly (I don\u2019t remember the exact price, but it\u2019s not more than 50 dollars for both; one bottle of estradiol easily lasts for more than two months depending on your dose; the blockers usually lasts for three). I didn\u2019t do electrolysis, but I know it\u2019s 60 dollars an hour (you have to pay the rest in excess of that), up to 160ish hours worth. They do not cover laser, so if you are interested in this, you would have to pay out of pocket. They also cover (full coverage) other procedures such as FFS, SRS, orchi, etc. (be mindful that they require a letter from a licensed mental health provider, so try to get in touch with one and start therapy as soon as possible if you are interested in these procedures). Today at 6 pm, btb (beyond the binary), a social space for trans people, is happening at the LGBT Center, so feel free to stop by if you want to ask questions/know other trans people at Yale; this is a safe space. There\u2019s also a group in GroupMe for trans people at Yale, and you can also ask all the questions you want there; feel free to dm me if you want me to add you or in case you have any other questions. All the best!!",

I know Yale Health insurance covers top surgery (I'm unfamiliar with the process since I am not transmasc, but I know some people who got top surgery through Yale Health). I am also an international student, and as long as you are on Yale Health insurance (not the basic coverage), you will have access to gender-affirming care. Here's a link to a PDF document specifying everything covered: [https://yale.box.com/shared/static/9xycgavanqx2cojhpvpl5egv7k03wxn6.pdf](https://yale.box.com/shared/static/9xycgavanqx2cojhpvpl5egv7k03wxn6.pdf). Let me know if you have any other questions/want to chat about being trans/international, or are interested in joining the Yale trans GroupMe :)",

He was ultimately able to sort it out but with all things health related at Yale, there is a fair amount of inertia getting things started.",

If you look through the gender affirming surgery section, it mentions top surgery\u2014the member coverage booklet attached (which I can\u2019t open but I know the link works) has a more detailed list of coverage in the clinical policy bulletin (just search gender, it\u2019s on page 37). Not sure if that link works\u2014it\u2019s too deep and I\u2019m on work wifi.\n\nAll of this is to say it shows top surgery is covered with a letter of support, which could be provided by a psychiatrist/therapist. I will say they certainly make you work for it\u2014planned parenthood got my bf on hormones immediately upon first visit while they had to jump through a few months of hoops and ultimately couldn\u2019t find the time at Yale. You can also expect to have some decently transphobic interactions in the name of \u201cmedical correctness\u201d (such as potentially putting your chosen name in quotes next to your deadname on some documents.)\n\nI can all but guarantee that the wait for something like top surgery will be long\u2014all specialty services are always backed up by months at Yale. \n\nI can maybe connect you with a student I know who got top surgery (I think at Yale?) if you have more questions but I don\u2019t know him too well so hopefully that\u2019s enough info.\n\nI doubt it would be different for international students provided you are on the full (e.g. paid) Yale health insurance.",

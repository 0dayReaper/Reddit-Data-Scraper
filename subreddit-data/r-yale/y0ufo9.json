    "postText": "Hello everyone! I was wondering if I could get the perspective of anyone majoring in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry. Do you like it? Do you wish you majored in something else? Is it alright for people looking to advance to the medical field? (I don\u2019t know if I want to do an actual pre-med route in case I end up wanting to do research in the field). Thank you!",

            "comment": "At Yale, mb&amp;b *is* the pre-med route, or at least it was, and is very solid for either medical school or graduate studies.  Many say it's the most challenging major offered.\n\nI and 2 roommates pre-requed mb&amp;b, I ultimately went to math and economics, another went to physics and comp sci and the more brilliant of the 3 of us completed the mbb, where he went to med school, although ended up in pharma. A gf also started mbb, but she went full biochem and did a PhD that way after considering an md/PhD program. \n\nDid we like it? They like it? Did he like it? Well, it was challenging and interesting. I may have liked the labs the least, early on, which is why I fell to softer science. Labs took up a lot of their time, their research asst, paid, jobs while doing the curricula were far more interesting and drove them to stay in mbb. Regardless, it clearly put us all on solid footing beyond Yale. \n\nIn case you haven't seen these\n\nhttps://mbb.yale.edu/academic-programs/introduction-undergraduate-program\n\nhttps://mbb.yale.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate-education/frequently-asked-questions-faqs",

            "comment": "I just graduated with an MB&amp;B BS (feels weird to say ... can I still say I'm an MB&amp;B major? lol). The traditional Yale premed route is definitely trending toward MCDB over MB&amp;B these days, as the former is less rigorous/chem-heavy and allows you more opportunities to explore electives without restricting you to a million core classes. There's definitely a perception that MCDB is \"easier\" because you can craft a major that's made up of that type of less intense class, whereas MB&amp;B has a) fewer electives and b) harder electives in addition to difficult required classes like pchem. \n\nAll that said, I picked MB&amp;B over MCDB because I just like chemistry and wanted to understand biology from a chemical/mechanistic standpoint. MCDB might introduce you to more topics in biology overall (e.g. neurobio, repro bio, etc) but MB&amp;B gives you the foundational chemical tools to understand any field from the ground up. It's an amazing major for either graduate school or medical school (or MD/PhD), and because you can take quantitative electives and get more of a computational background I imagine you could market yourself to corporate jobs as more of a quant-y chem major type person than a bio major (sometimes perceived as more of a \"soft\" STEM field at least on Wall St). But be prepared to work for it.",

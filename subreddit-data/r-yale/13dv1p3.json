    "postText": "Hi everyone! As an incoming first-year I've been looking through *ENGL 120: Reading and Writing the Modern Essay* syllabi from past semesters, and everything's so interesting! Some of my favorite pieces of literature are memoirs, essay collections, short story anthologies, and other forms of non-fiction like feature stories. The syllabi also mention authors I absolutely love, such as Jhumpa Lahiri, James Baldwin, David Foster Wallace, and Joan Didion. However, I have never formally been taught how to *write* because of how the education system in my country works. Sure I can Credit/D the class if I end up struggling, but would you recommend taking other introductory writing classes (ENGL 114 or an FYS) my first semester before taking ENGL 120? I will definitely take more writing classes to get used to the more \"academic\" style of writing, but the style of writing ENGL 120 covers is something I cannot wait to explore, and hence the question.",

It's a straightforward process to learn a lot, and get a lot of practice writing and analyzing things. Drafts and feedback are really good too. Obv this depends on the instructor, but the English department at Yale, including the TFs, are very strong.",

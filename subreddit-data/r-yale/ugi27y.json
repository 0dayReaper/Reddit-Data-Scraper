    "postText": "What's up guys. I'm a student at Emory coming to Yale this summer for some chemistry research. I don't really know much about Yale/New Haven but I'm hoping to meet some cool people and make some good friends this summer.\n\nI'm 20M, studying Applied Math/Stats. I'm into math, guitar, olympic weightlifting (also curious about what gyms are nearby), filming/edits, drifting, history, and a bunch of other random stuff. I'm decently outgoing and would be curious to find parties/etc. in New Haven too.\n\nIf you're here over the summer and we share any interests (or even none at all) definitely shoot me a PM! \n\nAlso my program said I'll be staying in Yale housing but haven't given specifics yet so if anyone has any perspective on what that's like it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

You might even have access to Paine-Whitney Gym which is apparently the worlds tallest gym. Which is kinda cool.\n\nDo you care for nightlife in terms of clubs?",

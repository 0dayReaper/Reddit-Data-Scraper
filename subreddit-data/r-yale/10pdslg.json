I am looking to connect with any current Yale NP students (any specialty), alumni, prospective students, and any recent applicants to create a group where we can share advice, experiences, provide support, etc. Comment with your stories, questions, or anything else!!",

Yales previously attempt at something like this has led to the program already being put on probation and risking having their accreditation revoked for that program.\n\nYou should also have extensive psych experience before applying so any school willing to take a student with no psych experience isn't one you should be wanting to attend.",

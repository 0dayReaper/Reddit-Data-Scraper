    "postText": "Considering transferring residential colleges to suite with some friends. I really like my current college (lived there not old campus) but I don\u2019t want to live with my current suitemates, and the people I wanted to suite with have plans so I\u2019d probably end up with people I wasn\u2019t super close with. Is it worth transferring after only one year? Has anyone transferred colleges? What was the process/decision behind it like?",

            "comment": "You'll have zero problems recruiting for quant from Yale as any of CS / CS &amp; Math / Math / etc. I'd be fairly surprised if Yale didn't have a slight to moderate edge here; quant is reasonably meritocratic in the context of finance, but some firms can still be rather elitist about school background (DE Shaw and Five Rings come to mind as obvious examples here). \n\nResearch opportunities will be equally easy to come by at both schools (UT by virtue of the honors program, Yale by virtue of access to professors generically being easy). The department at UT is larger though, so if you're interested in pure AI research, it might be easier to find a good match for your interests there. For more interdisciplinary research/applications (e.g. econ/cs algorithmic game theory, deep learning for bio, stat ML), I suspect it's a closer comparison. FWIW, I wasn't personally involved in CS research while at Yale, but everyone I know who wanted to do a PhD did end up at an absolute top program.\n\nFor entrepreneurship: there's not really a substantive startup culture at Yale -- only a few people drop out per year to do their own thing. UT may be better in this dimension, although I'd be wary of people advertising Austin/Texas as a 'budding tech hub' or 'promising startup ecosystem'. The same things are said of NYC and Miami, and in all honesty, everything just pales in comparison to San Francisco / the Bay Area / Silicon Valley proper. \n\nTech prestige: the only company that hired more Yale undergrads than Meta/Facebook last year was McKinsey. Google, Amazon, Microsoft were in the top 10 as well (which otherwise consists of the usual finance/consulting suspects). Don't overestimate subject rankings; in 99.9% of real-world scenarios, overall school prestige dominates.",

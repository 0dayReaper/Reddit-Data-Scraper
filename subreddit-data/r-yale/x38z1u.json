    "postText": "So im a rising senior and im looking to apply to Yale. Volunteering is a big part of my life, so I was looking up volunteer opportunities at Yale and 2 things caught my eye. President\u2019s Public Service Fellowship and Dwight Hall.\n\nFor PPSF, I was trying to see what exactly they do but I kept coming up with a lot of vague answers such as \"they do economic development\" and \"strive for human development in New haven and the world.\" That tells me nothing about what they actually do like on a daily basis or the amount of work needed. If someone has more knowledge on this, can you please describe the day-to-day work and maybe some projects with more specific details?\n\nFor Dwight Hall, my current understanding of it is that it's basically one large organization with a bunch of \"sub groups\" which do the actual volunteering? Please correct this if I'm wrong.",

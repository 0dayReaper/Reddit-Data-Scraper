My comment was referring to one of its greatest flaws, which I may add, you will find at any school: large, intro lectures (think gen chem, intro physics, etc) with too many students to get to know the professor, who often doesn\u2019t care much about the material they\u2019re teaching. It\u2019s the significant frustration I have with Yale STEM, but don\u2019t let it dissuade you too much as it\u2019s the same everywhere except small LACs.",

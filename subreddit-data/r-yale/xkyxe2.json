    "postText": "Greetings all,\n\nI am a senior medical student at the University of Jordan and I will be arriving at Yale to do an elective rotation in psychiatry at Yale New Haven Hospital. I am looking for a room during December 2022. My budget is about $1000 and I am looking for a stay within a walkable distance from the hospital. I am pretty chilled out, clean and friendly. Please message me if you have an available room for that time or if you know someone who might have one. Thanks a lot and stay safe everyone!",

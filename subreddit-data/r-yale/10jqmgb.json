    "postText": "Hi, everyone. I am a completely average student. I applied to Yale thinking, \u201cWhat do I have to lose?\u201d Well, in the surprise of a lifetime, I was accepted. When I read my letter, I collapsed and cried. I still can\u2019t believe it.\n\nFor reference, I got a 1350 on my SAT and have a 3.78/4.00 GPA. I am nowhere near the top of my class. There is no way that I will be able to succeed academically at Yale.\n\nHow did this happen? Out of curiosity, what was the first thing that you did after you were accepted to Yale? Were you as surprised as I was?\n\nThank you in advance for your responses!",

A piece of wisdom that really stuck with me is that the admissions committee doesn't make mistakes when admitting people. If you were accepted, that means that they believe that you will thrive at Yale.",

Yale will change your life, one way or another - it\u2019s students like you who have the most potential to benefit, I think. Remember to go easy on yourself when you get there, and reach out if you need support.",

He had a pretty low LSAT score, too, so I guess that's another indication that you can still do very well in college regardless of your test-taking skills.",

If you choose to accept, you\u2019ll get to work and study with some of the brightest minds in the world, and every day is a chance to learn from them. The doors will swing wide open with all the opportunities that come with going to Yale. Remain humble and take advantage of it all! Congratulations!",

You are far from an average student, and even if your \"stats\" are not quite on par with the average Yale admit, performance in high school does not equate to performance in college.\n\nI yelled and jumped up and down for several minutes straight with my mom!  Then we went and got gyros.  I couldn't stop smiling for a few days about it.",

So I\u2019d take those indicators with a grain of salt. Also your first year you can credit/d/fail (if you get above a C, it\u2019ll show up as \u201ccredit\u201d on your transcript, a D is a D and an F is a fail) any two classes (and then any four after that) so there\u2019s not an unbearable pressure to do well in classes. I\u2019m really excited for you, Yale is a great place!",

A bit of hardwork and creativity will go a long way, but you don't need to be top of your class with tons of accolades and extracurriculars to do well. You'll rise to the occasion, but it'll be a challenge. I can assure you that everyone who got accepted to Yale did not have the skills they needed to succeed immediately, they learned them over time. The imposter syndrome will eventually fade and you'll learn what you're good at and like. \n\nCome visit and think about whether you can see yourself here. Also, congrats!\n\nYea I also cried.",

I never even considered myself to be a potential candidate for schools like this because I thought you needed perfect stats (even though they aren\u2019t the only indicators of success, but I didn\u2019t realize that back then). I hope other people feel encouraged to apply reading this post because now I\u2019m wondering if I would\u2019ve been able to get in lol.\n\nCongrats again!! That is so awesome!",

    "postText": "I was just accepted to Yale REA. Yale was obviously my top choice going into this process, but I am now having doubts whether I should apply to other schools (mainly Harvard and Stanford) for regular decision in case I get in and decide to attend those institutions over Yale. Most of my doubts stem from the fact that I want to major in biology, but I haven't heard the most amazing things about Yale's STEm curriculum. I am also originally from Boston, so Harvard's location sounds more appealing than Yale. And, of course, Stanford is in California. A part of me wants this process to be over while another part of me wants to keep my options open. I still have to complete my other applications if I wanted to apply to Harvard and Stanford. How do I navigate this process?",

            "comment": "If you could trade your Yale acceptance for a Harvard or Stanford acceptance letter right now, would you?  \n\nWhy did you decide to REA to Yale instead of H or S?  \n\nDo you have concerns about financial aid that would benefit from having another offer to compare?  \n\nI was a stem major at Yale. STEM at Yale is great. The reality is that the laws of physics are the same (and thus the chemistry and thus the biology), whether you\u2019re taught it at Stanford or Harvard or Yale. I preferred the small classes at Yale and felt it afforded me better opportunities (research etc). But up to you.",

The Dean of Science is great and in comparison with friends doing STEM at the other places, I\u2019m very happy with access to opportunities and the incredibly collaborative feel at Yale.",

No harm in having more options.\n\nFrom my understanding, though, Yale\u2019s biology department is pretty renowned and Yale has a lot of built in programs for undergraduate research and such. I honestly think Yale is pretty strong in most STEM subjects in the natural sciences (and there\u2019s been a lot of investment into our CS program, though some engineering programs still have a long way to go). If you want to learn more about the biology program you can always contact the admissions office and ask to be put in contact with a current MCDB/MBB major.",

            "comment": "i understand your thinking (i was just accepted rea too), but it's ultimately up to you. even if yale is your number one choice, there's no harm in applying to the other two if you want to. i say dont let others make you feel like you shouldn't do something. i considered applying to harvard and stanford too, but ultimately decided i wouldn't go if i was accepted, so there was no need. i definitely say apply to other schools if you find that you're not entirely satisfied with what yale has to offer (even it's something as seemingly insignificant as location) or if you're just looking to expand your options. congrats on your acceptance!! good luck &lt;3",

Are you guys, some kinds of national or international champions of some activities ?\nI\u2019m curious, because I was rejected by Yale, even though I had 3.8 GPA (UW) &amp; 6 GPA(W), Varsity Volleyball player, 1st place in coding FBLA states, USACO Silver, SSTP Researcher, NHS, Founder of a Non-Profit, bunch of APs and a lot more .. \nI totally accept my rejection, because I know there are so many other talented students out there. but curious to learn about some of your strongest point. I heard some of them might be Olympic champions..",

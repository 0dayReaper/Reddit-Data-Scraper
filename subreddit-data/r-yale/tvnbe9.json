    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m an admitted student who\u2019s deciding between Harvard and Yale. I am incredibly grateful to have such great options, and I want to hear from the students about the downsides of each school before I make my final decision.\n\nGeneral info: I\u2019m planning to major in Classics. Yale has been my dream school since 7th grade and I worked on a research paper with a professor there. I love how approachable the professors are. I was deferred by Yale when I applied REA but got in during RD.\n\nOn the other hand, Harvard offered me a likely letter in February, which not only made me feel like Harvard genuinely wants me, but also gave me a chance to stay at Harvard for most of my spring break. They have a ridiculously strong Classics department, which is also twice the size of the Yale one. But I am afraid that Harvard will be too competitive and cutthroat.\n\nI\u2019m looking for the good and especially the bad of both schools \u2014 not to hate on one or the other, but only to gain perspectives that I will not get from the Admission Office.\n\nI\u2019d appreciate anything!",

You were accepted at both; you were clearly good enough for both; no one you will EVER interact with at either of the two places will have seen your application or have an opinion about whether or not you deserve to be there.",

            "comment": "Congratulations! You should be really proud of yourself, and hopefully you get to enjoy the fruits of your hard work when it comes to clicking that accept button.\n\nI feel like I could not have had a better experience anywhere else than Yale. I lucked into my first-year suite that I still live with, I switched from being a Literature major in HS to a social science applicant to an engineering major atm, and I exceeded my capacity to learn &amp; grow each and every semester. I have my highs and lows, but I have such amazing support systems through professors, TAs who became friends, friends who become suitemates, etc. that I would not trade any of my Yale experience (except COVID) for anything.\n\nTo be frank, I saw your post on the Harvard subreddit first. I like Harvard too, I won't lie, but throughout my time here I have realized a few things that made me OK with not going to Harvard. (1) I will do graduate school at some point, and Harvard seems like it invests more in its graduate training than its undergraduate training. Not that the latter is subpar, but Yale undergrads are treated really nicely. (2) Location proved to be a very non-issue. I really enjoy being in a small city that has access to big cities (2 hrs to NYC, 2-3 hrs to Boston). NYC has a lot more to offer than Boston but also is a lot to live in, so to have that proximity is great. There is also so much to do within the student body (cultural houses, suite parties, bands, club events, etc.) that I really cannot tell you anytime I wish I had been in a different city. (3) Yale has somewhat of a bubble that let me know the names of almost everyone in my grade. This was FAR from the case when my Harvard friends visited me. (4) In my experience, the school spirit flavor of Harvard always has to do with how prestigious it is and how much of a superior choice the school is to the rest. This is my experience in the cross admit group chat when I first got in, as well as throughout Harvard Yales, so it is rather personal.\n\nSafety is often considered a concern in New Haven. I think it is not unfair\u2014I think that caution is warranted if you go through the Green in the dark. I will also say that I have done that walk many times past midnight, or that I have never felt the need to call a Uber/Lyft in those cases. The campus itself is a lot safer than it is described\u2014I would argue that there is too much police presence on campus. They put in non-trivial measures to ensure you feel safe getting home, and it really shows in the last decade. For reference I am an international Asian male.\n\nFor my undergraduate career, I have a few things that I feel like I developed the most. First is multiple big social circles that have fun with me and support me. I have my residential college friends, my student orgs friends, my other student orgs friends, my major friends, my cultural house friends, etc. that I can talk about dumb movie shows or game-theoretic rationalizations with. I think Yale supports this slightly better with their housing model and the existence of cultural houses/peer liaisons. Second is that I learn the skills to be both a specialist and a generalist\u2014thinking critically and broadly through interactions with people I share no overlapping interests with. Third is that I am enabled to reach my goals however big or small. I got to go abroad on Yale's money, do research on Yale's money, learn filmmaking in Yale's money, and it seems like there will be even more opportunities. I think my Yale experience covers all the bases exceptionally well, making me both a better and a smarter person.",

FOCUS is a pre-orientation program designed for volunteering with local community through active participation and training/discussion on gentrification/town-gown relations. I think last year I became aware of more fellowships to do educational outreach in New Haven. Every other year you will see a New Haven-born Yalie running for alder board member in this district.\n\nThis only goes so far\u2014there are a lot of students whose goal at Yale is to maximize having fun among Yale students. Yale has a historically tense connection with the local community for sure. It is also a more interesting city to look at from a sociological angle, being the city that most closely matches the socioeconomic/ethnic makeup of the US in general. I think Yale (and Harvard, I believe) also benefits from attracting students who are dedicated to organizing and social welfare before and after college, so I think it will continue to grow in its importance on campus.",

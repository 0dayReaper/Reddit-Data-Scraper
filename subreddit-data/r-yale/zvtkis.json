    "postText": "Hey everyone! I\u2019m an 18 yo high school senior and just got into Yale REA. I\u2019ve been able to find a lot of information about academics, ECs, and the social life online, but I wanna learn more about the queer dating/hookup scene.\n\nI am a black gay trans guy. I am pre-transition and my parents are not at all accepting, so not sure when I can start transitioning. \n\nI want to ask: \n\n1. More generally, what does dating look like for gay men at Yale? \n2. If there are any trans people (especially any fellow trans men of color) who can speak to this, what\u2019s your experience dating/hooking up on campus?\n3. Do any queer clubs/affinity groups organize queer socials where you can meet people?\n\nI would especially love if any black gay trans guys specifically could weigh in. Please let me know if this isn\u2019t an appropriate question for this forum!",

            "comment": "Yale is heavy on hookup culture as opposed to dating. It isn\u2019t impossible to do so\u2014I (a cis male) maintained a three year relationship with a trans man throughout my time at Yale, but from my understanding it is far more common to hook up on something like grindr then it is to date. This is true for pretty much all orientations but I would say especially common for gay men. Not to worry though\u2014if you\u2019re interested in dating, it is certainly possible, and you won\u2019t be alone.\n\nI feel less equipped to answer the other two questions unfortunately, as I honestly wasn\u2019t too involved with Yale\u2019s queer scene, but the LGBTQ co-op is a very welcoming space that has frequent events, and if I recall there\u2019s a few clubs/support groups for queer students of color as well.\n\nYour question is certainly appropriate for this subreddit, and I wish you luck! There will be opportunities for you to talk about this with peer mentors if you end up committing to Yale, so you won\u2019t be coming in blind.",

I\u2019m aromantic (don\u2019t experience romantic attraction) so I\u2019m not too worried about the hook up heavy scene at Yale. \n\nI\u2019m hoping to have some non-romantic partnerships (think FWB or queerplatonic partnerships), so reading about your relationship with your trans bf is really reassuring :)\n\nEdit to add: Good to know about the LGBTQ co-op. I\u2019m hoping to be very involved in that organization!",

    "postText": "Hi! Yale is my dream school and I'm thinking about doing mech engineering; the thing is, I don't have any research papers, etc, that I could submit as supplements (though I have arguably done many independent research projects).\n\nI'm a bit worried because it seems having done research has become a necessity nowadays when applying to college. Has anyone gotten into Yale without having done formal research?",

The intensive ABET MechE degree (there\u2019s 2 easier ones, but not accredited) requires 20 credits and 8 prerequisites out of 36 Yale courses. It\u2019s impossible to double major in it and basically anything else, and if you wait too long to commit you literally won\u2019t be able to complete it. If you\u2019re not shooting for the accredited, you\u2019ll have a little later to decide.",

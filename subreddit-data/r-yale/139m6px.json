    "postText": "I'm a prefrosh who is steering towards premed and I was wondering which option would be best. I'm interested in both, but I feel like BME is a better choice with a greater backup plan in case things don't go right. Also, I come from a pretty relaxed high school with little rigor, so I'm not sure how exactly I would adjust to the load. Can people with experiences from either major let me know how the classes are and which one would be preferable?",

If you think you can handle it, go for it. My suitemates doing it, so it\u2019s possible. But speaking to the Premed advisors, they advised against it.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve got one semester left (I graduate this December) so many of my friends will have graduated already. And due to some complications I wasn\u2019t really able to think much about housing for next semester until this week. I don\u2019t really know anyone who\u2019s still looking for people to live with (at least to my knowledge) but really don\u2019t think I\u2019d enjoy living on my own. Really just looking for any and all suggestions on how to handle this.\n\n\nUpdate: I did secure a single on campus. Still fairly concerned about living on my own though.",

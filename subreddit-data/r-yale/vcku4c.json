    "postText": "hi everyone,  \n\n\nI was wondering if anyone here could provide input on their experiences in Yale's Symphony Orchestra. I'm an incoming first-year thinking about auditioning, but I'm worried that doing YSO might be really overwhelming for me my first year. If any of you guys have been in YSO and could tell me about the commitment needed and how enjoyable (or not enjoyable) it's been for you, it'd help me a lot.",

            "comment": "I would sincerely recommend trying it out. First year is the perfect time to audition, since it's when you'll most benefit from meeting all the people in your class and figuring out if you want to keep music in your life during college. The time commitment is heavy but you're supposed to take easier classes in your first year to figure things out, so it should work---and plus, you can always quit if it's not your thing.",

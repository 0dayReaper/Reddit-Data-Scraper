We decided on the East Rock area because it\u2019s a cozy neighborhood full of shops that\u2019s near the big park in the city, and it\u2019s in the Hooker school district. From what I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s the best children\u2019s school in the area.\n\nI\u2019ve also received recommendations to check out Wooster Square and Westville.",

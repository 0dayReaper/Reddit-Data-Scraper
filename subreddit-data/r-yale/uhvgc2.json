    "postText": "Hello I\u2019m looking for a Silliman plate from before they went to the common plate. Here is a picture of one https://artgallery.yale.edu/collections/objects/170094. I know they sold them here http://www.yale.edu/dining/options/yale_plates_order.html. However they no longer sell them there. So I\u2019m hoping there is another place I can get one. If you know where to look it would be much appreciated. Thanks!",

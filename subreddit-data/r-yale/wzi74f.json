    "postText": "I am looking to join a club sport while I'm here so I can be active since I'm not very self-motivated when working out on my own. I'd love to join the powerlifting club, the swimming club, the golf club, or really any club that will take a grad student. I don't think the directory is updated very often, and there weren't any sports clubs at the grad student activity fair as far as I could tell so I'd love if anyone in/affiliated to sports clubs could point me towards some contact/joining info. \n\nThanks! :)",

You could, for example, take 4.5 classes next term, 5 classes for the subsequent four terms, and 4 each semester of senior year. That would get you to 36 credits with only typical (&lt;6 course) terms.\n\nAdjusting to the workload is challenging. That said, I recommend that you implement some/all of the following: accept that your GPA won\u2019t be perfect, balance your schedule (don\u2019t stack all your hard major classes in a term, e.g.), and spend time honing study skills, seeking help, and applying yourself. To graduate you\u2019ll have to face increasingly challenging terms, and dropping courses isn\u2019t always an option. Easier said than done, but there are lots of resources around \u2014 if you put in the hours, you\u2018ll do well (don\u2019t expect a 4.0 every term!).\n\nBest of luck! I hope the remainder of the semester/year goes well. You\u2019ve got this :)",

That's a common attitude to come into Yale with \u2013 that you're naturally good at some things, and bad at others. It's not 100% wrong, but the entire point of taking courses is to *get good* at things. That's literally what learning is.\n\nNot trying to be mean, just want you to be aware that part of being a student here is trying your best at things that don't come easily to you. Growth comes from failure, and sometimes that requires hitting up every ULA session and office hour and reading the book and going outside of the course requirements to make sure you understand everything.",

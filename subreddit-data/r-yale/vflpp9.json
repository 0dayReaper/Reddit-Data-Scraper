            "comment": "Graduate school in what subject? \n\nSpeaking ONLY in terms of graduate school admissions: it is generally unfortunately true with most of the dual majors at Yale that you'd be better off in terms of graduate school if you chose one major or the other. There are no (as far as I know) \"Physics and Philosophy\" graduate programs; if you want to do Philosophy in graduate school, doing a Philosophy major will prepare you better for that, and same with Physics. I know for a fact that the Physics and Philosophy major will leave you vastly underprepared for a Physics PhD (I am less familiar with Philosophy graduate school admissions). \n\nThe dual majors have a bit of a mixed reputation. On the one hand you can 100% get a fantastic education out of them if you take things very seriously, and some people are truly extremely interdisciplinary and take very good advantage of the opportunities at hand. On the other hand, it's also quite easy to end up not diving deep enough into either major---particularly when one of the majors is as theoretical and has as big of a canonized undergraduate curriculum as Physics----and end up with something more superficial. It's also true that there will be very few faculty dedicated to these interdisciplinary programs. Some people absolutely swear by it, but in terms of keeping your options open, might as well start as if you were going for the double major, and see whether you'd be open to specializing in one major or the other, or if you do want to choose the dual.",

I'm a prospective Junior transfer to Yale's Economics program, possibly a double major in Music or Philosophy depending on if my audition goes well, and I wanted to get to know more about the secret societies. Also, if you're an Economics Major I'd love to DM you some questions about Yale Econ so please let me know!\n\nEdit: I meant Scroll and Key",

This isn\u2019t to knock Yale, but, it is a concern of mine because I want to know what sets Yale Economics apart from let\u2019s say Columbia Economics?\n\nSo far, what\u2019s really drawn me to Yale has been it\u2019s study abroad program, especially Yale-NUS. I know the collaboration has more or less died but it\u2019s still a very interesting to see how Yale is impacting the world but also cherishing its Liberal Arts history. Also Yale\u2019s Study Abroad program to Hyderabad is super unique and the only school on my list that offers that program.",

There's even a form you can fill out to somewhat guarantee you get tapped for one. Some societies have a bit more clout, and the three you mention will probably raise the most eyebrows, but it's not tied to stuff like money and connections anymore, just (somewhat) to campus achievements, (somewhat) to vague \"popularity\" on campus, and mostly just to being lucky enough to have happened to befriend a member at some point in your Yale career.\n\nI personally think society can be a really great social experience and an amazing way to make new friends senior year, as well as a good way to let go and focus only on having a good time on Thursday/Sunday nights. That being said I have had friends who had an amazing time in society and other friends who had an absolutely horrible time, and there is basically 0 correlation to whether the society was landed or had any \"clout.\" Maybe you'll just get lucky and end up with cool people, maybe some toxic people will totally ruin the vibe for you all year.",

But mathematically each A- seriously tanks your GPA and you need a long sequence of straight A's to recover.",

(3.9 ia a very common cutoff for summa at many colleges.) It really only matters when they announce your name at the diploma ceremony and you feel good. It is also printed on your diploma so you can always marvel at it :) I suppose you can put it on your resume but your GPA is more meaningful than whether or not you got honors, and what type. \n\n2. So before 1988, honors were based on the percentage of A's and A-'s. By today's standards, those percentages were rather low (you needed 80% of A/A- for summa cum laude.) Eventually this led to around half of the class graduating with honors, and to make this distinction more meaningful, the policy was changed to be based on GPA: summa to no more than the top 5 percent of the graduating class, magna to the next 10 percent, and cum laude to the next 15 percent.\n\nHere are the cutoffs (summa/magna/cum laude) for some of the recent years. The 2022/21/20 numbers are from reddit and the rest are from Yale Daily News. The cutoff for summa has never been above 3.97, even for classes affected by the COVID semester. \n\n2022: 3.97 / 3.93 / 3.87 \n\n2021: 3.97/ 3.91 / 3.85 \n\n2020: 3.97 / 3.92 / ???\n\n2018: 3.95 / 3.90 / 3.82 \n\n2017: 3.95 / 3.89 / 3.81 \n\n2013: 3.96 / 3.88 / 3.80\n\n2012: 3.95 / 3.89 / 3.80 \n\n2011: 3.94 / 3.87 / 3.78",

It should matter more how you did individually than how you did compared to your peers. Like, you could say for summa: only A/A- and no more than 10% of A- (just as an example). Or even all A's for summa if the university wants a super high standard. But the point is that your honors award should reflect your own performance and not how many other high-performing students happen to be in your graduating class.",

There\u2019s also no recognition that different majors have objectively different grading standards (e.g. I barely made it into Tau Beta Pi which is top 12.5% of GPAs my senior spring, but also barely squeaked into a cum laude (top 30%) honor.)",

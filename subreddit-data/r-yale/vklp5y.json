    "postText": "Hi everyone I was recently in new haven for a couple of days, and I was looking around Yale campus, unfortunately I found out that all of the building are behind a card reader lock, only for faculty and students. This in contrast to other universities in the states that I've been to where most of the building are open, I was wondering wether if this is because I visit during summer break, is this new policy or has Yale always been like this. \n\nThanks",

            "comment": "Yale has been like this for a while. I will say that access did get more restricted during COVID, and this has remained largely in place. Yale is also a private university so they are under no obligation to have doors open to the public. It is also a safety issue for the protection of both students and staff. Visitors are also a reason why access is so restricted. As you know Yale is a very popular university, and as such has a significant number of visitors annually. As a student, I often feel very uncomfortable when large groups of visitors venture into what are typically private spaces and begin snooping around or observing the student body. I will also say that even once you are in the Yale bubble there are still many more locked doors, and unless you know someone that knows someone a lot of these doors remain locked.",

                            "comment": "I have two thoughts as to why this may be the case. First, New Haven and Palo Alto are very different cities. Palo Alto is an incredibly wealthy city and the birthplace of Silicon Valley. It is a relatively safe place to live, and the make-up of the student body is likely fairly similar to that of the surrounding city. This is not at all the case in New Haven. New Haven is a very segregated city, with pockets of wealth and poverty. Crime has always been high here, though it has decreased in recent years. The Yale student body does not represent the makeup of the city, and as such students stick out like a sore thumb. There have always been incidents of theft and assault on students, and I will argue that many of my peers feel fairly unsafe walking alone at night. Secondly, and this may be less of a reason, Stanford unlike Yale is a contained campus. Yale is an urban campus and is very fragmented, thus making it much harder for police and security to ensure the safety of students and faculty. Lastly, Yale will always have applicants, so they don't feel as much of a need to cater to guests. The university's top priority will always be the safety and well-being of its students.",

And I didn't feel in danger when walking in the city maybe I was too close too Yale!\n\nI also felt that Yale was completely different to the overall new haven area, kind of feel like outlier and I can see how this would be a source of friction among residents! \n\nThanks for clearing this !",

            "comment": "Cause if we didn't, tourists would snoop around everywhere. It really is as simple as that. And it's not just Yale - most big universities do the same. Oxford and Cambridge colleges both disallow visitors, unless they pay an entrance fee during specified periods (normally weekends) or are prospective students. \n\nI'm not too sure how restricted it is currently, but normally visitors are allowed to go into Sterling Memorial Library and the Beinecke before 6pm, and it isn't particularly difficult to get into a college courtyard during the term. It may be less accessible now that term has ended and we are on summer break.",

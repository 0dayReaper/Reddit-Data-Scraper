            "comment": "If you\u2019re looking for a lower-effort, relatively chill job, being a cluster tech for the Student Tech Collaborative is probably the best gig out there :) You basically walk around campus making sure the computer lab printers in the residential colleges and other Yale buildings are working. You make $14.25/hour starting and get a host of other perks too:\n\n* most of the time you\u2019ll finish sweeping the buildings in your zone very early and can spend the rest of your shift doing homework while sitting and monitoring at a lab\n\n* extremely flexible working hours \u2014 minimum of 6 hours a week to max of I think 19 during the school year (and 40 over the summer if you\u2019re on campus and working), with two hour shifts every day on different parts of campus from 9 am to midnight\n\n* swipe access to most residential colleges (!!! this is a flex, great for visiting friends or just going to butteries/parties/events)\n\n* no actual previous computer experience necessary \u2014 people rarely have difficult IT problems, I\u2019ve had to unplug/plug back in some printers a few times but that\u2019s been the worst of it. just need the ability to keep a cool head and to consult the STC\u2019s very detailed online IT guide / skillfully google if that fails\n\nI personally also just enjoyed having a job that paid me to walk around campus as a first year and check out some of the lesser trodden-upon Yale buildings up on Science Hill. but once you\u2019re a full-fledged hire (also they pay you for your training, and for any time you spend getting additional IT certifications if that\u2019s something you\u2019re into), you can pick generally where on campus you\u2019ll be working, so you won\u2019t even have to do that much walking if you don\u2019t want to. the STC only does one yearly hiring cycle in the fall, though, so if you\u2019re interested make sure to apply as soon as you get to campus.",

It\u2019s mostly grad students who do it, but I met a few undergrads too, especially voice (coz grad voice students are crazy busy) and saxophone (coz there\u2019s no grad saxophone program).",

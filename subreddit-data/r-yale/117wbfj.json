I\u2019m hoping this isn\u2019t the case. But I\u2019ve heard grade inflation is common there and people have more free time. Not premed but wanted to keep my grades up for IB. Not trying to start anything but genuinely feel down thinking about it.",

Otherwise, it is fairly similar to Princeton.\n\nIf you wanted easy A\u2019s and people to commiserate with you prob should have gone to Harvard.\n\nOn the 1% chance you\u2019re a real first year at Princeton: Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. Starting at an elite institution can be difficult for anyone. Try to take care of yourself; get some sleep, get some exercise, and be kind to yourself and the people around you.",

The college also literally gives you money to throw parties - maybe that's why we have a reputation for having lives.\n\nGood luck at Princeton - I hope you find the help you need",

Big cold puddles around those massive slate slabs that made up the sidewalks. And in the pouring rain, on Old Campus, was a guy holding an umbrella for another guy who was trying to hit golfballs over the roof.\n\nBoth schools have rigorous academics. One school has a student body that knows how to relax.",

Yale, like Princeton, can have some rougher courses than most other universities but, at the end of the day, it's all how rough your overall schedule is.

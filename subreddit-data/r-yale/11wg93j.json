            "comment": "Money is probably not the deciding factor here. (Assuming a Yale/UNC grad can get a job where 16k loan paid over time won't be a massive deal.) Picking based on networking and summer opportunities also shouldn't be a deciding factor or tie-breaker if you're at college nearly 40 weeks a year. But Yale is really good at both of these.\n\nJust do the standard stuff: visit(!!!), watch day in the life videos, go through the course catalogues for both make a hypothetical course list for your major and general requirements (had some nasty surprises doing this for some school I was otherwise set on going). \n\nNot hard to imagine that UNC has more \"spirit\" but these are things you have to see for yourself.",

That means 12 classes in my major (not too bad for me, for something like EPE there's like 24 courses you need to take). Looking at my major requirements I gotta do 3 in this field, 4 in that field, X electives, 1 final project. Double check on Yale course search, are there 12 courses where I'd be actually happy with every single one. Look at general requirements, there's a language requirement where you gotta do 3 terms of a language, may as well go all the way up to L5 since no point going halfway. Have to take 2 science classes, majoring in humanities and really wasn't expecting that so check the course catalog filtered by Sci Requirement to see if there's stuff I like, etc. That's 19/36 classes, so can take 17 more entirely for interest/erudition/fun. I made a list of stuff I liked in the course catalog and can compare how enthusiastic I am about it compared to other schools.",

So it\u2019ll just come down to visiting each and deciding which you like better. Personally the decision for me would be a no-brainer: yale. But maybe you just like NC more, or you like something specific about the program you\u2019re interested in NC more, maybe you want to end up in chapel hill after you graduate, etc. The networking at Yale is limitless so that\u2019s not really an issue either. But they\u2019re both very good schools. I would not let $4000 a year/$16000 total be the deciding factor either. Even if you had to take out a loan you\u2019d have no problem paying it back after you graduate. I\u2019m sure you could make at least $2000 a year at an on campus job and cut that amount in half.",

If you have any clarity around that question now, it should be a factor in your decision. Your undergraduate school will have **the most** influence on your first job, or on your (first) grad school, so think about where you need to *be* to get where you want to *go*.\n\nAre you looking to go into finance/banking or consulting? If so, you probably will have the most options for senior-year recruiting at Yale. It will be easier to get yourself in front of the people who do the hiring. (If an MBA is in your future, bear in mind that you will work at least a couple of years before you apply to that program, so your first job out of school will be key.)\n\nDo you want to continue in academia and go into a Ph.D. program? You should examine your particular field more closely and see whether Yale or UNC has more sucess at sending people into good grad school programs. It could go either way, depending on the department and the faculty.\n\nDo you want to go to law school and practice law in NC, or be involved there policitally? Are you committed to journalism or non-profit work focused specifically in the state? Then you probably would have an edge coming out of UNC, if only for networking purposes and opportuities for internships and part-time jobs.\n\nIt's okay if you don't know the answer to this yet ... many people don't, and many other people change their minds once they start college. But if you CAN use this as a factor in your decision-making, you should.",

But let me tell you the truth ... I didn't get anything out of it educationally that I couldn't have gotten in an honors college program at UNC or another prestigious state school. The possibilities and opportunities and support that will be available to you as a Morehouse-Cain scholar likely surpass what you would normally get as an undergraduate at Yale, unless you are going to be one of those undergrads who is ON THE HUSTLE from Day One. Those people exist, and good for them. But it's a hard life and might keep you from fully embracing some other facets of college life. You don't need the Ivy League name to be impressive ... graduating from UNC as a Morehouse-Cain Scholar with no debt and that honor \"on your resume\" would be an **amazing** start to a professional life.\n\nThat doesn't mean that I don't value my Yale education, because I do. But I didn't go into a high-powered career where the specific networking circle was invaluable to me later, and I didn't make a bevy of wealthy, elite friends who catapulted me into a higher social stratus for the rest of my life. I took some good classes and some boring ones, and I met a lot of regular folks who I love to this day. And yes, it's a bit of a cach\u00e9 on one level to say that you went to Yale. But it's not the end-all/be-all of life. So don't let yourself think that you'll regret it forever if you get into Yale and don't go.\n\nThe older I get, the more I realize that lack of debt when you graduate is probably the most valuable thing you can have. I know $16,000 doesn't seem like a lot, but it's more than zero. With no debt, you have freedom to make so many more postgraduate choices.",

I have no connection to anyone who is there now, so I don't know what it's currently like.\n\nMy experience: I came from a public magnet school in an under-represented-at-Yale state. Pretty sure that's why I got in. I didn't exactly think I *didn't belong*, but I was intimidated going into it. Just about everybody I met, whether they came from public or private, seemed to feel the same way. And the ones who claimed they didn't, I think they were probably bluffing. :)\n\nI enjoyed college! Most of my classes were interesting, I LOVED my major, and I had an especially good department head at the time, someone who I'm still in touch with today. A few classes I picked were duds for me, either because it wasn't really something I enjoyed or because of the instructor. I had a nicely even balance of lectures/small classes, and I don't ever remember feeling like I needed help and couldn't get it if I asked for it. I was an A student at my magnet high school and a solid B student at Yale. I probably could have pulled A's there too, but I wanted to do activities and have a life.\n\nThe students around me were, overall, smart and motivated. Most people were nice, a few people were assholes ... just like at every place I've ever worked. Some of the prep school people were very insular, but there are enough people around so that doesn't matter. You will find your circle, whether you're in New Haven or Chapel Hill. Several of my good friends from Yale are still my good friends now, and I've been lucky to live near many of them at various times.\n\nI graduated into a recession, backpacked for a couple of months right out of school, and then did an extended internship that led to my first full-time job. I got that job through a friend-of-a-friend situation (although I'm sure the Yale part didn't hurt). I went to grad school a few years later, and that's probably where the Yale name helped me the most. I honestly do not think that any subsequent job I've had has hinged on the name of my college ... at that point it's more about your work experience.\n\nI would never counsel anyone NOT to choose Yale, but I will most definitely say that it's not the only path to success, it's not a guarantee of happiness or riches, and a full-ride, well-known merit scholarship at a prestigious large state university is a RARE gift and has a lot going for it that Yale never will. \n\nI'm so excited for you either way!!! :)",

My time in both places - as a student, as an adult starting/figuring out my career, as a person living my life - both places were pivotal for me in developing my identify and professional skills/experience, and I can\u2019t say I\u2019d want to do anything differently. \n\nThe big thing that sticks out to me is that at Yale, everyone is told constantly how special and bright they are - by the institution, by professors, by peers etc. But at UNC, you\u2019re at a public school - a very nice and well respected one, but a public school nonetheless. The environment is inherently more practical and working class. UNC is also a much bigger school,; as such you\u2019re exposed to a much more diverse group of people and backgrounds. That isn\u2019t to say that Yale isn\u2019t diverse, but you are surrounded by over achievers - and at UNC you\u2019re surrounded by normal people.\n\nI\u2019d be happy to answer any questions about either place if you DM. Not sure how relevant my answers will be since my field (music) is so niche, but I could at least comment on the basics of living in both places and the academic environments. Wouldn\u2019t be able to speak to any of the Morehead Cain advantages/differences",

            "comment": "Throwaway not to dox myself, but let me know if you want to talk more since I was in basically the same situation. TLDR: I believe UNC only wins if strong school spirit, greek life, and sports are a must for you; or if you live close and really want to stay close to your family. In any other case, I believe Yale wins.\n\nI was in a very similar situation and ended up choosing Yale. I had received the flagship scholarship for a very prestigious public school (ranked a little higher than UNC-CH) that had all expenses covered + summer stipends and opportunities + networking + privileges inside the uni. At Yale, I would have to pay \\~20k/year. I was also super nervous about classes since my school was also easy As. Here are my thoughts, which I hope are helpful. Keep in mind I did choose Yale, so there will inevitably be a slight bias, but I will do my best to keep it to a minimum.\n\n**Networking and summer opportunities:** Networking here will definitely be stronger and finding summer opportunities is not hard. Unfortunately the world runs a lot on credentials and signaling, and the Yale name will likely make up for the easier access to internships offered by the scholarship. For other situations (international opportunities, jobs further down the line, etc.) the Yale name will definitely be stronger. The situations in which UNC will be better is with companies or organizations who have ties to the scholarship or are more local (i.e., organizations that know well the scholarship and have incentives to recruit from the pool of scholarship recipients). In this area, I would say Yale wins.\n\n**College life:** This depends somewhat on what you want out of your undergraduate life. UNC definitely has a lot more school spirit, party life, sports, etc. than Yale. It is also a much bigger school, and the student population is likely to be a little more diverse. Yale doesn't have as much school spirit and sports, is smaller, and will be a little less diverse. For me, what Yale had to offer in the social scene was enough, but this is something you have to find out for yourself. In other realms of college life: food here is amazing compared to most other schools; dorms are good enough; New Haven is not a phenomenal city, but the campus is very safe and pretty. I am very happy here. In conclusion, I think it comes down to this: if big sports events, intense Greek life, and very strong school spirit are inegotiable parts of the college experience for you, then UNC wins here. If you want these things but they are not deal breakers, or don't want them at all, then Yale will be just as good. This area is very nuanced, so feel free to ask more questions.\n\n**Other considerations:**   \nMoney is clearly important, but I think 4k/year is not large enough to be a big factor in your decision. Attending Yale basically guarantees you a high-paying job later on, so this extra cost will be negligible in the long run. Mine was 20k/year and I still think it's worth it.\n\nClasses were also a big concern for me, but it's not hard to get good grades here if you keep up with your work. My concern came from my fearing I might not be smart enough or might not have developed the proper study habits to keep up, but I found none of this was true when I arrived here. I definitely did not have proper study habits in high school, but the academic environment here made it very easy to develop this super quickly. If that's where you're coming from, don't worry--you will be fine. If you are afraid of classes for a different reason, let me know why and I can try to give a more tailored answer.\n\nI know this is long, but I was very conflicted when it was my turn to make this decision and would love to have had more information from someone in a similar situation. Hope this is helpful, and let me know if you want to talk more. You have two fine choices and will do great regardless of what you choose!",

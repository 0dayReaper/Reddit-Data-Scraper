    "postText": "Hello Yale!\n\nI'm currently a journalist student at the University of Southern California working on my capstone project, which deals with the lived experiences of online students at universities partnered with tuition-sharing companies called Online Program Managers. Essentially, it's very new that your tuition was even allowed to go towards these third-party companies directly and I want to get as many student voices on what these programs are like now that OPMs have been dominating the industry. \n\nYale is one of the bigger OPM customers, and [a company that was under investigation by the U.S. Senate-](https://www.wsj.com/articles/democratic-senators-probe-whether-online-degree-programs-contribute-to-high-student-debtloads-11642203842)\\- shared that they still have [quite a lot of contracts with you guys.](https://2u.com/partners/yale-university/) I'm gearing to interview as many people as I can, so please don't hesitate to reach out even if you think you don't have much to say! I'm interested in interviewing anyone who's attended as an **online program** student at Yale, regardless of class standing or even whether or not the program was completed.\n\nMy project is independent and won't get published for now (nor will it be done without the full consent of all sources) so you don't have to worry about hurting anyone's feelings or sparing details-- I just need to be able to verify that you were a student. Please don't be shy if you're hesitant about not having enough to share, as anything helps!\n\nTL;DR, if you or anyone you know is or was a student at an online program at Yale, I would love to hear you talk about your experiences! If interested, please DM me or email me at lilliang@usc.edu.",

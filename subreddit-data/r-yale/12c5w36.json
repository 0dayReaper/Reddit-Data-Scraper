    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm a prospective student currently deciding whether I should commit to Yale. I'm a trans guy, so the trans/queer experience at Yale is quite important to me. Is there a place for me to connect to some trans Yalies? I've been scouring the websites for info, but I would still love to talk to someone about stuff like like housing, gender-affirming care and so on. Thanks!",

They host various [student groups](https://lgbtq.yale.edu/Groups) specialized for different identities and experiences (eg ace/aro,  trans and non-binary, etc) and may be able to connect you with some people. I've reached out to them in the past and they've been very kind to me, but I totally get it if you want a non-Yale admin resource so I hope someone else here can provide that to you. The current GPSS President [Nic Fisk](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2022/10/24/wrestling-to-the-senate-nick-fisk-in-control-at-the-gpss/) came out in a Yale Daily article as trans and non-binary during their term and as far as I can tell it was very well received across campus. They're a graduate student, but they might be an amazing person to reach out to.",

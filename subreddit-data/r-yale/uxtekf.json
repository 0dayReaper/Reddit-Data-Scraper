    "postText": "i'm an incoming sophomore transfer (but i took a gap year so i'm currently 20) thinking about the mid-orientation programs. i know that FOCUS has a transfer-specific program, but do the other programs put transfers in groups with only first years? i'm interested in FOOT but idk how i feel about being 20 in a group with 18-year-olds trying to make friends with other 18-year-olds (especially bc the social aspect is supposed to be a big draw). has anyone done foot and had a transfer student in their group?",

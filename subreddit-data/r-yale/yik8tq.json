You can show them your yale ID and explain that you wanted to checkout the courtyard\n\nEdit: if you wanted to get access, you can apply to become a grad student fellow with the residential college. You\u2019ll have a monthly commitment to answer grad school questions from undergrads, but I think you\u2019ll get to eat there for free two meals a week or so",

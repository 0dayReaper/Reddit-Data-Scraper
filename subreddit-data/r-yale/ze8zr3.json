    "postText": "Hey everyone! So I'm a freshman who placed into organic chemistry, however I did so by studying a lot for the placement. I was confident in my understanding of the content when I did the placement, but I would need to study over Christmas break to prepare for orgo. I was thinking of dropping down to gen chem, but I've heard that its almost harder than orgo because its a weed out class which is made unnecessarily hard. Should I take orgo, or should I do gen chem? Also taking CS 201, intro linguistics, and french literature\n\nThoughts?",

            "comment": "If you were confident on the placement test, you have a solid understanding of the foundations of chemistry. \n\n\nYou'll want to take organic chem. It's hard because you have to really minutely study the content introduced, not because it's very high level. \n\n\n\nGen chem won't really be worth it in several regards: \n\n1. You automatically get a gen chem acceleration credit if you take orgo instead\n\n\n2. The content is pretty low level. My roommate's homework halfway into the semester was drawing Lewis dot diagrams for biatomic salts\n\n3. From what I've heard, it's one of the classes where the difficulty is more just arbitrary nitpicks than actual content. The genchem lab specifically is known for people failing lab reports over nitpicks",

                    "comment": "I also think you should take orgo, but I don\u2019t think some of these reasons are super relevant. \n\nThe acceleration credit does literally nothing unless you\u2019re trying to graduate early. Also (at least when I was still at Yale) there were two different gen chem tracks. The easier one is as described, but the second one covered quite advanced topics (and was arguably harder than orgo from what I heard). Gen chem lab does suck a lot though so avoid that at all costs. \n\nI think that a lot of the value of orgo comes from your classmates, who are self selecting for being smart and ambitious even for Yale standards. Also, depending on how tight your schedule is, you might not want to spend a semester taking another course.",

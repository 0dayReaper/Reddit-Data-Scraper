Unless you have an upperclassmen in your intended major advising you on what to do (and you happen to be in a major with fixed intro courses rather than more open-ended majors in the humanirites), or unless you generally a lot of familiarity with how things work at Yale, it's almost certain you'll end up taking other stuff.",

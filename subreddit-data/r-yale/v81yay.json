    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI'm a member of the Class of 2026, and I'd like to ask how Yale processes your A-level grades. The grades will be my Final Transcript, and I'd like to ask how the school views your final A-level grades, seeing that the offer given is technically unconditional. I'd be interested to hear about how they view the further maths A-level.\n\nThanks",

This study involves just one video visit that would occur over Zoom. During the visit, you would answer a few questions online, then complete an interview that would be recorded. The visit would take about one hour. If you are currently pregnant and it is your first time expecting, you may be eligible to participate in this fully online study and earn a $40 e-gift card as compensation for your time. \n\nPlease email or call/text if you would like to learn more: [thebabl@yale.edu](mailto:thebabl@yale.edu) or 475-282-3607.  \n\nHIC #2000032814",

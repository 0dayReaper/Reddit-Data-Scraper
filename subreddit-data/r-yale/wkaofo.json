Alternatively if you\u2019re flexible on destination airport, you can land in EWR and take one of the Amtrak Northeast Regional trains from the airport station to union station directly. That way you don\u2019t have to worry about transfers\n\nLink to the EWR + Northeast Regional route: https://goo.gl/maps/W9qcKC6icbiYkNzi9",

It depends on the day but the NJ Transit and the Metro North both run like every half hour or every hour, from 5am to midnight or so, so it's super reliable and you can buy the tickets at the station or online.",

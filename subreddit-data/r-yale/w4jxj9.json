I have therefore considered combinations of all the following majors.\n\n- Economics\n- Ethics, Politics, and Economics\n- Economics and Math\n- Computer Science and Economics\n- Computer Science and Mathematics\n- Statistics and Data Science\n- Applied Math \n- Computer Science\n\nAny advice? I have made a bunch of sample schedules and compared. I just have no clue which looks best for jobs and/or grad school. That's my primary deciding factor as I want to pay my family back.",

Even lots of people who think they\u2019re certain about their choice of major change after a year or so. Just take courses in what interests you over your first year and get a good sense of what the requirements for each major are, and usually by sophomore year you\u2019ll have a better idea of what you want to major in.\n\nWill also reiterate u/ezStiles point:\n\n&gt; Largely wont make a difference. You can become a banker with a history degree from here",

Look for a field that turns you on and you have a passion for.  Even if you end up with a liberal arts degree, you can end up being a investment banker, lawyer, etc, because of your Yale education if that's your cup of tea.  Good luck.",

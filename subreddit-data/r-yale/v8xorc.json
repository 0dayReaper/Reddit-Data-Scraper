    "postText": "Hi, I am a rising college senior (at a different college) and I am applying for full-time Research Assistant positions at several universities next year, including Yale. As the title suggests, I am wondering how walkable downtown New Haven is. I am getting an adult learner's permit this summer and I am planning on getting a license by the end of summer, but I hate driving, so I would strongly prefer public transportation/the Yale University Shuttle, if they are sufficient (I read that all Yale employees get access to the Yale University Shuttle for free). If I get an apartment in downtown New Haven, would this be feasible? Would it be feasible if I lived outside the downtown area too?",

            "comment": "Maybe my perspective is skewed as an undergrad, but I find New Haven incredibly walk-able. I walk from Union Station to campus (although there is also a free shuttle). I walk to stop and shop. I walk to the farmer's market and to east rock. If I want to go somewhere far I can use the shuttle, Uber, use a friend's bike or rent a zip car.   \n\n\nNew Haven is probably one of the most walkable US cities I've ever been to though.",

I also don't have my license or a car, but the New Haven area has decent public transportation and I find the Yale and Downtown areas of New Haven to be walkable. Obviously the extent of how much you will be walking around depends on where you end up living but I think it's manageable in my case.",

I've used public transpo/buses when I had to go farther from downtown and they're okay. A few bus stops in NHV aren't safe but it's just like any other city where you gotta be vigilant. So yeah, totally walkable - I survived 11 months in NHV without a car as an RA haha.",

Hopefully someone else will have another suggestion with a wider range of hours. ETA: Does anyone know if Yale Law School's Library or the Marx Social Science Library have open to the public hours? Those were two of my favorite off the beaten path libraries to study in, in addition to the NH Free Library, but I'm not sure about open to the public hours.",

It\u2019s underground in front of Sterling Library. There\u2019s also an indoor area with some tables/chairs and vending machines before you enter the actual library, it\u2019s not always as quiet but you can eat there.",

    "postText": "Hi y'all. I'm a freshman. I'm currently writing this post at 5:45 AM, having gone to sleep around 2 AM. These past three days, I believe that I've gotten a combined total 11 hours of sleep--but I still feel like I'm cruising. But whether or not I'm cruising into a jagged iceberg has yet to discovered. This first week has been...well...incredible, but at the same time, I've been experiencing such strong emotions that I literally can't sleep. Classes start soon, and I was wondering whether anyone else had ever gone through/is going through something similar and how they've dealt with it. Note that I'm pretty averse to taking any drugs or supplements. That's all folks!",

    "postText": "Got accepted to my dream grad program at Yale, I'm so excited to be going up to New Haven! I currently own a car and was wondering if it was worth taking it up. I like the liberty that comes with owning a car, but I don't know how much free time I'd even have as a grad student to use it for adventures. I'd be living in East Rock, so I'd have the street parking or the parking provided by the house itself (backyard/driveway maybe). \n\nAre there any additional costs that come from owning a car? And is it worth it?",

I will say that it's also easier having a car in East Rock as opposed to downtown. Ultimately your choice, but just for simple things like groceries and errands, it is helpful. Best of luck!",

However I only used for grocery shopping, leisure outside New Haven, and going back home every other weekend. In New Haven, I only walked, used the shuttle, took an Uber.",

That was really helpful, and sometimes I did wish I had a car, but most of the time, I could get what I needed from Nica's or P&amp;M, albeit a bit higher priced. \n\nI definitely didn't have a lot of time to use my car for driving around, but I did wish I had one on my breaks--like a lot. That would be the best time to use it. It did seem like a pain in the ass to have on snowdays, but not the worst. \n\nCaveat: 1.5 of my 2 years at yale were spent in the pandemic \n\nHope that helps!",

But it is nice to be able to do Walmart and target (which you can\u2019t even walk to cause 5+ miles) when you want or even go to the gym or the mall. New haven itself is mostly restaurants. Any entertainment is a drive away.",

It\u2019s a huge time saver to have a car if you want to use a cheaper store like Stop and Shop for groceries rather than the pricier markets in that neighborhood. \n\nI can\u2019t speak to how much free time you\u2019ll have, but nearly all PhD program grad students I knew definitely went on adventures from time to time.

    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI was recently admitted as a grad student, and received a significant financial aid award. I\u2019m a first generation student who has quite a lot of debt from undergraduate, and although my aid award was significant, I will still face financial stress upon attending and likely have to add a large amount in additional loan debt along with working while completing the program to cover costs of living. I am going to be attempting to negotiate my aid package soon. I was wondering if anyone who successfully negotiated for more aid would be willing to share any tips, strategies, or stories about their experience. I\u2019m feeling pretty nervous about the conversation, and although I\u2019ve read a lot of online resources about negotiating a grad school package, it would be helpful to hear from students at Yale who have already lived to tell the tale. Thank you so much for any comments or help!",

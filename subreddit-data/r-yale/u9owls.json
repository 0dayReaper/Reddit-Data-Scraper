    "postText": "Hi there! I'm an incoming grad student starting my PhD at Yale this fall (woohoo!!). I need to be moved in by August 1 as I have a course starting that day. What is the right timeline to be searching for off-campus housing? I'm on the facebook page but it is still mostly summer sublets and there isn't a whole lot on websites like apartments.com/zillow right now. Should I already be looking, or is it too early? Any recommendations on where I should be looking or general tips? Thanks! :)",

            "comment": "Congrats on your admission! You should check out Elm Campus Partners ( [https://elmcampus.com/](https://elmcampus.com/) ). They are Yale off-campus housing but can fill up quite fast. The website/process was a little confusing to me at first so feel free to PM me if you'd like an explanation. Otherwise I would just keep checking :). When I moved here I subletted a place for 2 months, then I found an apartment on Craigslist. Now I'm moving into an Elm Campus owned apartment.\n\nEdit: There are some companies to avoid. I'm still new to the city so hopefully others would be more helpful but don't lease anything from Pike International and I think Mandy (something).",

These apartments will have a \"viewing\" date listed. It's not a true \"viewing\" but it's the date the apartment will be released for bids. On those days, you then select apartments and order them according to your preference. After the \"viewing\" day is closed, the company then looks through all apartment bids. Individuals with older accounts will get priority on preference. If you were chosen for an apartment, you will be given an offer and you will have 48 hours to accept. Then everything resets again for a new \"viewing\". The first time I tried I didn't get any offers so I think it really depends on timing. I got fortunate this time because I was looking for a lease starting in June/July. Let me know if you need any more help :).",

Since I've already accepted I can't go check but as soon as your account is approved you can look at available places to get an idea of rental dates. I might start looking now just to see! And agreed about your previous comment. It's really confusing. Someone explained it to me. If you need more help you can PM me :).",

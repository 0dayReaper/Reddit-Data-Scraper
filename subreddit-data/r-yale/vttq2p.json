That aside, you'll get a lot of information as you go - here're some random resources/tips:\n\n* Get to know Sandy Chang, he runs a lot of STEM programs and fellowships and such including:\n* STARS, a program for underrepresented students in STEM\n* Don't bite off more than you can chew in your first year, Yale classes are quite hard for a lot of people, and unlike most students, your college grades matter significantly\n* Try and maintain at least one clinical volunteering activity starting as early as you can - example programs are Haven, hospice, Elder Horizons\n* Gen chem lab sucks really bad from what I've heard so if you can place out of it I'd recommend you do so. That said, first-year orgo is much harder than regular orgo but more rewarding, so if you are in a position to pick take that into consideration",

Just try out what looks interesting and do things because you care about them, not because you are trying to put together an application in 3 years. The one exception is coursework: try to map that out as much as you can because courses have prereqs, fill up, conflict with other required courses, etc. Source: am Yale alum and an entering med student!",

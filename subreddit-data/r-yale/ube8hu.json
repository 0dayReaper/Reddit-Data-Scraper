The trend is that its getting better, though, mostly through the work of student advocacy groups like the mental health association which are actively working to improve the systems in place",

If you know you have a history of mental illness or mental health challenges, you should get signed up with \nthe counseling office right away and do a preventative intake appointment. If you end up having an issue it\u2019s much easier to get seen as an established patient rather than a new one",

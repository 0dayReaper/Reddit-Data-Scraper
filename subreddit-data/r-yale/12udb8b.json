If some buildings require a Yale ID for access, am I allowed to use my student ID and bring my parents as guests inside? Thanks all",

You should have plenty of time to show them the entire campus, it's quite nice to walk around. \n\n&gt;If some buildings require a Yale ID for access, am I allowed to use my student ID and bring my parents as guests inside?\n\nYeah, just use common sense.",

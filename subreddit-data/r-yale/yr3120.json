    "postText": "Apparently Yale doesn't let students stay in their dorms during winter break and that kind of worries me because not only does my family live in the west coast, but my home is kind of toxic and abusive and I don't feel very comfortable going back, even if its only for a few weeks. I was wondering if there's other students like me, and where do you go? Will I have to find a cheap apartment?",

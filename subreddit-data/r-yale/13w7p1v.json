    "postText": "Hello!\n\nUpcoming freshman to Yale here. I'm excited to see what's in store for the next four years but lately, my body has just been paralyzed at the thought of entering an environment like Yale. Besides Yale, I was also accepted to my state schools (UCLA, UCSB, UCSC, etc) and in restrospect, I was more \"comfortable\" with those schools but I ultimately choose Yale because it was a better academic fit (smaller classrooms, closer community, more involved professors).\n\nThe social aspect.. however, has been eating away at me. Everyday, I get this overwhelming sense of dread. It's not that I don't think I belong at Yale, but the fact that I'll probably end up being \"average\" at Yale -- and everyday, I'll have to be faced with STEM-geniuses, national debators, and other talented students.\n\nDon't get me wrong -- I know that I cannot be the \"best\" in any context, and I'm fine with understanding that there will always be a smarter student than me .. but the idea of being in an environment where I'm not \"special\" is .. a bit of a scary idea. Sorry if that sounds really self-centered or egotistic.\n\nHow can I get over this fear? It seems like everyday the feeling gets worst, and I can't help feeling \"inferior\" to every Yale student I meet because I automatically assume they're smarter than me.",

Also most undergrads here are particularly sheltered and privileged which makes them particularly dumb in a lot of everyday ways. Trust me, that helps the imposter syndrome vanish real quick lmao.\n\nRemember that everyone has things they're super good at, and everyone has things they're tragically bad at. Help people with the things they're bad at and you're good at, and ask for help with the things you're bad at from people who are good at them.",

            "comment": "Something that helped a lot for me was reframing feelings of inferiority from \"what am I not\" to \"what can I become.\" I came here to learn from people who know more than me, not because I already knew the answers. It's an uncomfortable realization (trust me, I know) that you are suddenly Very Average once you get to Yale, but I've gotten so much more out of my experience here once I left my ego behind. So in that vein, don't be afraid to ask lots of questions. Don't be afraid to admit that you don't know the answer sometimes or to ask for clarification. Chances are that there's a lot of other people who are also wondering the same things but are too afraid to ask. There are so many ways to meaningfully contribute to a classroom or community without being, say, the #1 student in math olympiad.",

Just graduated last week, and what I'd tell you is that you have to build a life for yourself that you are proud of on your own terms, regardless of others' perceptions. I didn't do anything spectacular at Yale, but I was happy as a clam, worked on stuff that I cared about, carved out some social rituals with some people that I'll continue to care about long after the diploma's in my hand, took academic risks, etc. End of the day, I was happy with my life, and all those reasons I listed are totally independent of what somebody else is doing that looks bigger or better on paper. Cause if you think about it, wtf does some other student being an Olympian or taking classes freshman spring that I took senior fall actually have to do with me? The answer is nothing. Certain things, like applying for jobs, inherently require you to care about how you look on paper, but that's different than what you're describing. Day to day happiness, you've got to look at just yourself and ask if you're proud of what you're doing and whether you are trying your best. The answer could be yes or no, but whatever it is, it has nothing to do with other people.",

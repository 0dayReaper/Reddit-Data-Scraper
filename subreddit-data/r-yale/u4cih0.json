I just have a silly question about merch and whether it'd be weird to wear it when I'm on the campus for the event?? One of my warmest outfits involves a Yale sweater and I just don't know whether it would be pretentious/bad taste to actually wear it on campus (since I've heard mixed thoughts on the issue). Thoughts?? Thank you!!",

Of course it may be a different culture, but I say go for it. I know I\u2019ll be wearing some (or at least the free t shirt).",

You certainly won\u2019t look out of place or anything wearing Yale stuff.\n\nEdit: I think this partially because I received a huge amount of college mercy for free/cheap but would have had to buy Yale stuff myself, with official Yale stuff also tending to be more expensive.",

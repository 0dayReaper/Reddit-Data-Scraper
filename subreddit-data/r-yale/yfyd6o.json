I know a couple of the parties in the YPU are into that sort of thing and I'm planning to check them out, but I don't really know of anything beyond that.\n\n(Also don't say effective altruism bc I don't believe in that lol)\n\nThanks! Any help would be appreciated :)",

I am happy to talk more in PMs if you want to know my opinion on the various parties, but won't pressure you to if you want to let that be an independent exploration. The only public thing I'll say is that parties don't always emphasize what they actually do, so definitely attend a lot of things before any commitment. What is on the brochure isn't always accurate.",

Personally I go to iSpa in Orange because it has the right blend of price point to service (just get the regular pedi IMO) but there are certainly far more talented aestheticians if you want something really fancy. For instance, Nail Haven does nail art that is really intricate and beautiful but quite expensive. Hope that helps.",

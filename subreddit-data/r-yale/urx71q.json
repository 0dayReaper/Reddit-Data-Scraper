I've heard good things about Portuguese and Indonesian so far, can anybody who has taken either of these share their experience (L1-L3).",

Other contenders: Zulu, Yoruba, Polish, Akkadian, Italian (it\u2019s a bit more difficult than the others on the list but there are more sections).\n\nAlso, check with your Dean but I thought foreign language had to be completed before the end of your junior year so you might have to get permission to finish it during your senior year.",

They do things like movie nights, Italian scrabble games, and other events that give you credit in your language class. The language isn't super hard to pick up and the tests/quizzes are not challenging at all if you put moderate effort into studying for them. I can't speak to Japanese or Portuguese, but indo is probably going to be easier than Italian in workload (though Italian is not bad) but much less useful. Plus, Italian has the study abroad program in Siena!",

Would you recommend I start language freshman year to get to L5 level, or sophomore year to get to L3 level by the time I'm in Italy.",

    "postText": "I come from a small school without a football team, so I might be naive when it comes to the difficulty of being selected for a football team, but is it possible to walk-on for Yale Football without previous experience? I played Varsity level D1 sports in high school, specifically basketball, and I am 6\u20196\u201d 290 lbs and lift. I obviously wouldn\u2019t start or anything, but I\u2019d like the community and staying fit. I\u2019m attending this fall. Thanks.\n\nBy the way, any other suggestions for possible varsity or club level teams would be appreciated, with my past experience in mind.",

            "comment": "It's unlikely, but your best bet is to reach out to the coach directly.  They may have a \"try-out\" process available.   But a varsity commitment is like taking on a full-time job on top of everything else.\n\nClub might be the best option -- you still can travel, have competition, and can be part of a team.  There is no club football, but many others including rugby and basketball.

I honestly do not think I would make the cut for club basketball (at least the a-team), since basketball in the US is a cut above where I am from (Canada). I assume most of those guys played AAU to some extent and were high minute players on their team throughout high school. Again, thank you for the advice.",

The team has lots of players coming from a background in other sports. Way less of a time commitment than a D1 sport like football but the more effort you put in, the more you get out of it. Message me if you want more details",

Do practices take up all 20 hours that are allowed by the NCAA? What would the tryout process look like? Should I just email the coach? Is there any possibility of me being able to travel and compete with the team, even if I\u2019m just the third string backup?",

I tried to make sure of that in the post, showing that I recognize the fact that without a strong high school background in Football I already have a slim chance. I'll make sure to be in the gym constantly this summer (was already planning on it, but now it will be more athletics focused rather than bodybuilding) now that I know there exists a possibility. Again, thank you so much for all your advice.",

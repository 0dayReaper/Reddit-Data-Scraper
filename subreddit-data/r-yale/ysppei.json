            "comment": "I am a graduate student, so my perspective may be slightly different from the undergrads, but I just want to say that these anecdotes given in the article are not one-off situations. Every single person who I have spoken to that has tried to get through Yale\u2019s Mental Health and Counseling services has the same story. \n\nWhen I first matriculated, I did my due diligence of reaching out for a psychiatrist and therapist (and later also for accommodations). It took them five months for me to be assigned a psychiatrist, and another month to be assigned a therapist. I had to reach out multiple times to get a therapist. Luckily for myself, I have been dealing with my mental illness for 10 years now, and am able to get by without more frequent visits.\n\nOnce I was finally assigned a therapist, we met for all of 5 sessions before she informed me that I would need someone who would be able to see me more frequently and more long term. I was given a contact for someone who could help me through this process. I reached out to them, and was told that I would receive a list of eligible therapists within a week. That list never came. It took an additional two months and me complaining to my psychiatrist before the person would even respond to my email. Six months later, I still have no therapist, and have to take matters into my own hands despite my repeated discussion of my personal executive dysfunction when it comes to scheduling appointments and the assurance from MHC that there are services in place for people like me. \n\nThey also changed my psychiatrist without warning, which happened to coincide with a time in which I desperately needed a refill for my medication, which forced me to have multiple emergency calls to get the prescription filled. The only silver lining is that both psychiatrists I\u2019ve had are lovely and caring people who I feel have taken me seriously and act with my best interests. \n\nThis post ended up being longer than I intended but I just want to say: it is not just the students interviewed in the article and it is not just me. This is the story of every student who tries to get mental health help from Yale.",

This should probably be even more the case for \"elite\" schools where the expectations and workload are higher, instead its the opposite and for reasons that are nothing to do with education and all to do with prestige (and to some extent, pride).",

            "comment": "One, admit this is a real problem, and then start at the source. People (even this article) quickly jump to blame Yale and Yale Corp, when I would say it is more likely that a toxic professor, toxic advisor, or toxic DUS is what is most likely to have a tragic effect on a student\u2019s well-being in the first place. And can we be honest and admit that there can be toxic professors, advisors, and DUS? My (limited) contact with Peter Salovey over my short time here has shown me that he does in fact care immensely for the student body, and his policies prove that (and, surprise, these are also Yale Corp policies. Shockingly, Yale Corp does care about its students!) Now, I have had a majority of great professors, advisors, DUS in my time here, but there have been a few that have dazzled me by something that I can\u2019t even begin to describe here. I could only begin by throwing out words that I don\u2019t even completely understand the full implications of, words like \u2018sociopath\u2019, or \u2018psychopath\u2019. They exist, and there is no magic boundary around Yale to keep them from becoming a professor, an advisor, or a DUS. I\u2019d investigate if any of these suicides, attempted suicides, or other mental health emergencies have overlapping professors, advisors, or DUS. Please start there.",

I\u2019d argue that the prestige of Yale not only attracts the best in academia, but also, possibly, those as I described above. The world of academia is not something that is free of psychopathy, sociopathy, or even plain toxicity, and these powerful institutions would, in my opinion, be very attractive to them.",

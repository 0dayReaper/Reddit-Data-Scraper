    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman, and I just received my [yale.edu](https://yale.edu) email account by following instructions on the portal. However, my address is quite verbose (and hard to remember), following the format: \\[firstname\\].\\[lastname\\].\\[initials\\]\\[random\\_number\\]@yale.edu.\n\nIs this normal for most people? In addition, since my name's pretty long, is there any way to configure your email to be a shorter, more memorable version without the periods and digits?\n\nEdit: I talked to ITS, and they were happy to give me a workaround!",

    "postText": "Hi, I am first year PhD student at Yale and I wonder if any friends here are interested in forming a band, I am open to many styles of music, including jazz, R&amp;R...\n\nI used to study Accordion and flute for a couple of years, so I have music theory knowledge. I also have studied guitar for almost half a year, and I hope by constructing a band I can sharpen my skills.\n\nPlease dm me if you are interested in it. Thanks a lot!",

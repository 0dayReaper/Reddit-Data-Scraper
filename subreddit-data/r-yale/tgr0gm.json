OIS provides the opportunity + support of doing important things when you move to another country - getting a bank account, SIM card, bulky items like bedding (they take you to Target), etc etc. It also provides a great opportunity to meet fellow internationals as the overwhelming majority of international admits do OIS, as opposed to another pre-orientation.",

You do a lot of things with your assigned group, but you're definitely afforded more opportunities to meet people outside of it - something which you can't really do as much (if at all) on FOOT.",

Most activities are optional AFAIK. But my family came w me a week early to do all of that stuff and to tour around america a bit so i didnt do that. If you want to have fun and bond, foot is the way to go. Personally i did no preorientation",

Yes, you will eat mostly basic things (peanut butter + X in tortillas, usually), but it\u2019s a fantastic experience and I\u2019d highly recommend it to anyone who generally enjoys the outdoors.",

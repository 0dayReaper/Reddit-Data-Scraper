    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman, and I'm thinking of taking PHIL 125 and PHIL 284 this semester, both of which are WR courses. PHIL 284 appears to be a new course taught by a visiting professor, so I'm not sure if it will ever be offered again. Has anyone here taken two WR courses in one semester? Even if not, do you think it's manageable?",

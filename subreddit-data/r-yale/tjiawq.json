    "postText": "I'm an international student (UK) looking to apply to Yale for 2024 entry. I was just wondering what extracurriculars admitted undergraduates have done so that I have a reference point for the level that I need to be aiming for. Thank you!!\n\nEdit to clarify: I'm not asking this so that I can copy other people's extracurriculars.  I just want to see the standard level of the kind of extracurriculars people did so that I know whether I'm keeping up with the standard and have a chance of being admitted. I will only do extracurriculars that I personally find interesting, fun or gratifying, I'm not just doing them to get into Yale.",

That's what I've been doing so far, but I want to see the standard level of the kind of extracurriculars people did so that I know whether I'm keeping up with the standard and have a chance of being admitted.

To give you an idea, a was interested in small businesses and Econ development, and won a startup competition with an idea related to it. However, I also listed other extracurriculars in which I wasn\u2019t the best or didn\u2019t have a leadership role, such as volunteering and creative writing, etc.\n\nHope this helps!!",

Besides that you also need activities within your specific field of interest. Be sure to clarify and expand the scope of these activities which goes from ( international, national, regional, school) so u want them to have as high scope as possible.",

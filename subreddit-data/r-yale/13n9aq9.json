    "postText": "Quick context: I've been living with multiple cognitive and a few physical disabilities all my life.\n\nI grew up being told by just about everyone in my old hometown, I'm never going to grow up becoming the things I want to be. \n\nGuidance counselors hinting the most success I would have is at our local fast-food restaurant. Cousins telling me I'd have more success joining the street gang pertaining to my zone. My parents disdaining me for ruining their chances at the \"American Dream\" and dreading that seemingly forever low-income status.\n\nMy parents equally admitting I'd never fulfill my dreams of becoming a Physicist.\n\nSomehow, even though I lived a lifetime of others telling me what I can and can't be, I was inclined to believe they were all wrong and I can build my own path to happiness.\n\nSo I did.\n\nI chose to graduate high school early and escape poverty; escape my hometown and the people that only wanted bad for me, including family. \n\nLife has a great way of working out when you have absolute confidence in yourself.\n\nI met someone who introduced me to marketing as a career in a beautiful, posh city. Filled to the brim of wealth, affluent people, oceanfront views, they told me I can earn all this and more if I believed in myself.\n\nSo I did.\n\nI embraced marketing as a way of earning income, and it's actually fascinating. I found ways to help others develop an acumen for strategic communication, negotiation, develop disability workshops in entrepreneurship and help them earn revenue, see them fulfill their dreams of forging their own paths and not a path contingent on their disabilities. \n\nWithout turning this post into an entire TED talk lol, I'll finish it as I finally became financially stable and moved to a safe city to start community college. I've always been fascinated by the inner mechanics of our universe, and that's what I'd like to do long-term: discover more of our universe through research. I love that prospect.\n\nWhich leads to yesterday: I was admitted as a Junior transfer for Physics and I'm definitely committing. Younger me probably wouldn't begin to fathom Yale (let alone my local state school), but I'd bet younger me would appreciate the first step they took to live in gratitude.\n\nTwo takeaways: the Law of Attraction is 100% real; you can and will attract positivity if you elect to embrace positivity. And, you can become everything you've ever wanted to be and more; never sell yourself short even when there's a universe thinking otherwise. You can choose to live in gratitude the rest of your life.\n\nI can't wait to meet everyone in New Haven this Fall!",

The class is tough, but has a lot of interesting material. I think the professor Chang has really good teaching skills. That being said, psets and exams are much much more difficult than the material covered in class, particularlly, very little math was taught or reviewed. Also, a lot of people had difficulty getting accommodations. Overall, I think it's hard to say what's better, but probably 238. It covers different material to some extent, but I think it prepared people well enough for 242.",

It doesn't do grades by percentile, but raises people grades according to a specific equation, so that the base score isn't zero if you get zero in everything etc. It's not just raw score, and you don't have to compete with others, which is nice.",

You can maybe start with the curator or collections manager, whose emails are on that page. I do not personally know anyone in that division, but I interact regularly with the staff of another division and they are some of the friendliest, most enthusiastic people I know.",

She would gladly talk to you about bugs for hours given the chance and is incredibly open with both Yale\u2019s collections and her time. The collections manager at the Peabody is also super nice, although I only met him once.",

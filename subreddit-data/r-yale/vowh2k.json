    "postText": "This is probably an eccentric post and notwhat this sub is intended for, but here goes! I\u2019m a graduate student at Humboldt Universit\u00e4t Berlin participating in a Comparative Literature conference on Yale\u2019s campus August 14-19 and since Airbnbs in the city are out of my price range (the week before orientation!), I wanted to inquire whether anyone on this sub might have a couch that I could crash on for a couple of days. About myself: I\u2019m a first year master\u2019s student in comp lit at Humboldt specializing in French literature, in Berlin I also work in a bar and organize a film club. I\u2019m tidy, respectful, and would love to cook a few meals for the residents of the apartment, and/or provide wine, beer, and groceries. \n\nOf course, the next time you find yourself in Berlin, you would have a tour guide and a place to crash :). \n\nThanks in advance for reading!",

You also might want to reach out directly to Yale grad students in Comp Lit/Film, if you can get contact info them.",

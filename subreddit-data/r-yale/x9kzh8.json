            "comment": "I'm in a very different graduate program, but as far as life is here? Living in New Haven is hard. I moved here from NYC and the transition has been really difficult, and pretty much everyone in my program agrees living here is awful. One of my classmates and I pinpointed it the other day-- it's all the worst parts of a small town, and the worst parts of a big city, with the benefits of neither. \n\nI expected to miss NYC, but I didn't expect to actively hate New Haven. For what it's worth, I've lived in several other east coast cities and loved them all, I'm not just comparing New Haven to New York here.\n\nYale has the top program in the country for my specialty by a long shot, and academically and socially it's great, but if there had been other programs of this caliber to choose from, I probably would have picked a school in a better location.",

Sure, there are some downsides to New Haven, but it\u2019s also not the worst.\n\nThere are plenty of benefits to this location though. The weather is nice, especially in the summers. It\u2019s sandwiched between Boston (2 hours north) and NYC (2 hour train ride south). There\u2019s a \u201cnice\u201d beach ~15 mins away in west haven and there are plenty of things to do down town. There are lots of breweries and distilleries within an hour or so to tour. There\u2019s also a lot of hiking nearby too. \n\nIf you live in East Rock then you\u2019ll be close to all of your friends. On top of that, every single grad student that I\u2019ve met here is super friendly and I\u2019ve made tons of life long friends. \n\nYale also really cares about their students and in my experience has spent copious amounts of money (I\u2019m in SEAS, so I understand it\u2019s not like that for all depts.) on events just to give us an opportunity to socialize. The first year or so here wasn\u2019t the best but the last few years have been some of the best of my life.",

I'm used to Southern California and as of the last two and a half years, Texas. Though I can't say I'd mind the change.   \n\n\nIt's great to hear Yale cares about its students. That is one of my biggest concerns. My brother just finished with a PhD program in the UC system and needless to say there were some issues, if you weren't up to date with the Graduate Student strike going on there a few years ago.",

                            "comment": "Full disclosure, I don't have a car, and neither do most people in my program, so that probably at least partially contributes to our collective dislike and feeling trapped here. That said, I think the fact that you apparently have to regularly leave New Haven to enjoy living here speaks volumes. \n\n- It's a food desert. There's a couple tiny overpriced markets, but overall there's only one full sized grocery store in New Haven proper (and it's not nice). You have to drive/take the bus to get anywhere else. It's also a drive to get to a Target or a Walmart, there's not even a hardware store in town. I've used Amazon more than I ever have in my life since moving here. \n\n- The crime is not great. I've lived in \"dangerous\" parts of major cities and I feel more unsafe here than I ever did there. One of my cohort had a traumatic break-in, and most of us have experienced some kind of issue while here. The panhandlers are more aggressive here than in NYC, and in my experience the street harassment has been worse. There was also a violent hate crime near old campus last weekend, which as a person of color makes me even less comfortable here. \n\n- The person who replied said there's hiking is either full of it or has little hiking experience. CT is flat as hell, you're looking at a big hill at best. You need to go several hours out of state for anything decent hiking wise. East Rock park is fine but I wouldn't call it a hike by any means. \n\n- The weather here is fine, but not great. Sticky, humid New England Summers, depressing winters. At least in my program, some of the academic buildings don't have adequate ac to deal with the weather here, to the point that indoor events have had to be rescheduled due to heat. \n\n- Most of that other commenters suggestions were for things an hour or more away. Personally, I don't consider things not in New Haven as \"benefits\" to being in New Haven. I personally don't have time for a 2-hour+ round trip any time I want to have fun. \n\n- Downtown sucks, in my experience there's little to do there besides eat and drink. There are some good restaurants here, but that's about it. Walking around New Haven isn't fun or interesting, once you leave the area surrounding campus it's mostly houses and dead strip malls. \n\n- Yale has some good museums, but you can get through them pretty fast, and then you have to wait for exhibits to change over. \n\n\nLike I said, socially it's great. But almost any fun I've had here has been stuff hosted by my friends or my program. You really have to make your own fun here, New Haven offers very little imo.",

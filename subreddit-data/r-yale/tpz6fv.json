I am planning on attending bulldog days and Uchicago\u2019s admitted student weekend but beyond that I\u2019m not too clear on how the experience would differ at either school.",

And also wait to see Yale\u2019s financial aid package. Going to bulldog days should help you decide if you are still troubled.

However, half tuition is no small potatoes and UChicago is an amazing school with postgrad prestige factor equal or nearly equal to Yale. If I were you, it would all depend on family financial situation. Is your family able to cover full Yale tuition without significant hardship? I\u2019d pick Yale. Are student loans in your future? UChicago. I\u2019d also ask on the UChicago subreddit to get a more balanced opinion too and see how students there like it :)",

As chemtiger said, (but I\u2019m going to say it more directly), a PhD is free; you actually get paid to do one. When it comes to law school, if your family has the resources to pay in full for your undergrad (especially even if you have a merit scholarship offer on the table), it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll help you pay for law school as well. I encourage you to have an honest and open conversation with your parents about financial support and what that might look like over time.",

And would you want to go for a masters or a PhD?\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking of a STEM field and PhD, then you shouldn\u2019t worry about grad school finances (as much), since programs will almost always cover tuition and give you a stipend (ranging from 20k-50k, depending on the school, it\u2019s area, and your field). Some will also cover health insurance and stuff.\n\nFor social sciences and humanities, I don\u2019t know as much, but I think they often get a stipend too for PhD.",

Yale is to some degree an arrival school, meaning that it's pretty difficult to fail and grade inflation is quite prevalent, while uChicago is a tougher academic environment where they push you harder and there is grade deflation. That being said, they are both great schools, and you should probably get a good idea of which one you want to go to based of financial aid and admitted student sessions, which usually give you a pretty good idea of the vibe of the particular school",

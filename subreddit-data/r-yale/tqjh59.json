    "postText": "Hi guys, I am an incoming Freshman and I was wondering how non varsity sports work at Yale.\n\nI know there are Intramurals and that there are weekly matches for some of them.\n\nHowever, are there any sport clubs/societies which have regular trainings and are semi competitive but don't require someone to be varsity level and have a sort of social organisation like uni sports in the UK ?  \n\n\nI would want to start learning a sport over this summer which I could continue at Yale in a non varsity fashion(since I wouldn't be NCAA level) like rowing or sailing. Do any of you have an idea if there are any non varsity clubs for these sports?\n\nI also fence competitively(not at a varsity level though), and I was wondering if I could continue that at Yale in any way?",

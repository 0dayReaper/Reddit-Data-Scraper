    "postText": "Hi there! I got on offer a couple of weeks ago to study abroad at Yale for a year (I study at a university in Asia) through the Yale-VISP program. Essentially, I\u2019ll be an incoming exchange student at Yale. I was wondering if anyone knows of what the experience might be like, or if you\u2019ve interacted with any VISP students, or if you\u2019ve even heard of the program at all haha. Say, how are visiting students perceived on campus?\u2026 (even though there aren\u2019t too many as far as I\u2019m aware). Any thoughts or insight on this (or lack thereof) would be much appreciated!!! Thanks!",

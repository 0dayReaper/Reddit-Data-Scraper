PWG has more equipment than the college gyms, but I've always worked out in my college gym and have had no problems.\n\nTo answer your broader question, freshman work out at a variety of places depending on college. During my freshman year I remember most of my friends working out in PWG\n\n(Ignore my username, I go to Yale)",

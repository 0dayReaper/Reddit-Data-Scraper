My sister went to UNC on a similar scholarship (don't remember which one) and can say you certainly will have way more career opportunities if you go to Yale. There may be other considerations for you such as cultural fit etc. But if it's about career opportunities and money isn't a major factor, I think Yale is the obvious choice. Again I wish I could say otherwise",

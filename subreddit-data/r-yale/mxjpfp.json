Yale is a private institution so they probably have a bit more latitude. The entire system of California public colleges is also requiring the vaccine or if approved exemption they have to do regular testing multiple times a week. Stanford as well.",

As has been pointed out there are many legal considerations that need to be addressed before this can happen.  One reason for the student vaccine requirement coming out now is for students who don\u2019t have easy access to the vaccine yet. Not all countries have equal opportunity to the vaccine presently, which can cause problems for students trying got one to attend in person classes. With the early announcement, this allows for those students to either trace earlier so they can get vaccinated in New Haven/the US or plan accordingly where they are.",

The vaccine will help address that. \n\n2) The duration of natural antibodies. We still don\u2019t know the duration of natural antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. If we base it off of past coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 probably has a few ways to shorter this duration or get around it. \n\n3) Variants. This is probably the most popular way to get around natural antibodies. Your body makes antibodies for what it\u2019s been infected with; variants change enough that your body might not recognize. Therefore, it can get around your natural defense. The vaccine, on the other hand, presents a base mRNA that all SARS-CoV-2 use. So instead of learning how to fight a specific variant, your body learns how to recognize this part of all SARS-CoV-2 virus and attack it.\n\nOverall, the vaccine helps ensure herd immunity and limited spread of the virus so both student and faculty/staff are safe.",

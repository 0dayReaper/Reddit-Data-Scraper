Professors almost always have the ability to allow you to skip them for any reason; you just need to convince them that you have enough knowledge to be able to not flounder in the more advanced class.",

It's very unlikely that you're actully forced to take any particular class, or that they'd really take any of your external credit in lieu of nything.",

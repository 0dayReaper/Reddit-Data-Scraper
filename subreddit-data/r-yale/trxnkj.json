    "postText": "Hi, everyone. Prospective PhD student with funding/insurance package here wondering if there are any disabled/chronically ill students (or anyone, really!) on here with experience with Yale Health.\n\nIn particular, I'm wondering if anyone who's had to see specialists might be able to share what their experience has been like. I have a few complex conditions that need a lot of management and potential experimental treatment. Here are a few more specific things I'm wondering:\n\n* Whether it's easy to see specialists\n* What wait times are like\n* Whether the experience at Yale Health as a student is more or less frictionless, or if there's a fair amount of bureaucracy and annoyance, especially for those with disabilities and chronic illnesses\n* What your experiences with doctors or institutional contacts at Yale Health have been like (how sensitive, response, etc. they are; what the professional culture seems to be)\n\nReally anything would be helpful. I'm just worried about moving across the country, away from my support network, and having a hard time. Thanks.",

Not sure) wait times range from weeks to months depending on what exactly you need. For chronic stuff it progresses at a decent enough rate (my friend who suffers from chronic pain has seen about 20 different doctors in the past 2 years) but you can certainly expect some major delays seemingly out of the blue. \n\nThey do seem to want you to get the care you need but it very much is a squeaky wheel gets the grease after weeks of complaining scenario.\n\nThe one thing they\u2019re pretty decent at is scheduling repeat visits, but the initial one is much harder.",

And I got into PT in like a week.  But it took 18 months to get a pap smear.",

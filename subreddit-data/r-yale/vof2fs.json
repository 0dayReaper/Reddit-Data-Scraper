    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm an incoming freshman and I recently received an outside merit scholarship for $7,000 per year for four years. I know that Yale has a $3,700 limit before they essentially absorbed the rest of the scholarship.\n\nI was hoping if it was possible for the scholarship foundation to only send $3,700 per year, then save the remainder to be sent as a scholarship to be used for study abroad?",

It\u2019s not against any Yale rule I\u2019m aware of (and it\u2019d hard for Yale to tell the scholarship foundation what to do with *their* money) so as long as you can come to an agreement with the scholarship provider you should be fine.",

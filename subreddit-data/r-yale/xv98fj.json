On my tour, they said it was something about community building? Can anyone confirm?",

People are usually either going to their dorm (yellow) or class in LC, so the diagonal paths help get from Point A to Point B quickly.  \n\nSide note\u2014can anyone confirm if this map is updated with which college lives where? I\u2019m a few years out of Yale and it looks very funky!",

            "comment": "The walkways were designed by university president Theodore Dwight Woolsey when he ordered the creation of the Old Campus we have today. Before his presidency there was Old Brick row, which was just an open field with two lines of old brick buildings like CT hall running through the middle. Woolsey knocked those down (except for CT hall) and arranged the buildings on the outside with an internal courtyard students could spend time in. He wanted the walkways to be purposefully inefficient and intersect in many places to encourage students to \"run into\" each other on their way to and from classes and intentionally spend more time walking around in between classes and activities.",

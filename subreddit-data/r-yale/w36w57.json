    "postText": "Hi all, I am applying to Yale this upcoming cycle, and though it is the ultimate reach, I still am willing to give myself the shot.\n\nI am an aspiring chemistry major. I would also like to study chemistry during my undergraduate period. Can anyone at Yale speak on the Chemistry department and what its like? What are some specific qualities about an (I assume) extremely strong chemistry department?\n\nSome insight as to what Yale/ New Haven life is like would also be greatly appreciated. \n\nThanks, all.",

I've had nothing but good experiences with grad students and instructors, though I've heard some concerning things about the departmental leads, nothing that affects me too much though.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you want more info.",

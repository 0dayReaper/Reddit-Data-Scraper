    "postText": "I understand that CPSC 100 is Harvard\u2019s CS 50 course online, with some in person lab time. In the past, I\u2019ve learned better in in-person settings, especially for quantitative reasoning classes where I want to have easy access to help. Was it relatively easy to find peers on campus to work through problem sets with? Was it easy to get help from tutors or faculty on problem sets?",

It will be very easy to find/make friends in the class, I wouldn\u2019t worry about that. Office hours are reasonably well-staffed and spread throughout the week \u2014 would recommend going earlier (not the day before the deadline) for timely help or else the queues can build up.",

CS50, like 201 &amp; 223, is a big classes and so you'll likely find a few people doing the class from other places v quickly, and if not there you can talk to people at office hours and make friends there. I generally relied on peers but office hours are definitely available if you want more knowledged help.",

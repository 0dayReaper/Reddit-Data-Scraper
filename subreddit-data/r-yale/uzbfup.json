First semester is filled with so much stuff outside of classes just in terms of new experiences and you do not wanna be overly stressed or busy with school during that time. 4.5 credits is more than enough",

Also, one of my courses I took credit-D to further lighten my load.\n\nThe key is that your coursework first semester shouldn\u2019t be a source of stress or challenge. There\u2019s enough going on as-is, don\u2019t try to challenge yourself with your classes. But, if you talk to your professors/froco and understand what you\u2019re getting into, its a path some do enjoy.",

I found 3.5 to be really nice first semester, definitely would not have been able to do 5 (did 5.5 last semester as a junior and it was exhausting). 4 or 4.5 is the best course load, especially as a first year!",

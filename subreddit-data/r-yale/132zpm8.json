So your stipend will go up to either $4300/year (or $5900/year) and then the outside scholarships will substitute for Yale Scholarship of the same amount. I'm not sure how it works for something like the Gates Scholarship that adjusts based on COA, but the point is that your outside scholarships will replace student share first and the leftover will replace your need-based financial aid.",

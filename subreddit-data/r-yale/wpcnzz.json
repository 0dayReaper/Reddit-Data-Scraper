    "postText": "Hi everyone and sorry for the throwaway! Wanted to remain anonymous because its a bit embarrassing. \n\nLong story short, I'm currently a rising sophomore in Yale College and I don't have many (or any) friends. I tried my best last fall to join clubs and go to events but even though I met a lot of people, I found it hard to maintain any real connection to them. I would try to start a conversation but I could never get past the basic intro questions (name, major, college, etc.). I have three good acquaintances, but everyone else is just a stranger. I was just wondering if there was anyone else who went through a similar experience who might able to speak about how they overcame it? I'm looking into possible club sports teams to maybe \"fix\" this situation so if anyone has any suggestions for a beginner that would be helpful too. :)",

Your mileage may vary, but at the very least it should give you a group of people who you see regularly and can chat with.",

Granted, I was only there for 2 years (master's) and most of my weekends I went down to NYC to see my bf. \n\nI just wanna say keep an open mind and don't be afraid to reach out to people! Maybe ask your good acquaintances and see if you can hang out. Not really sure how is the dynamics for undergrads but there are a lot of opportunities to meet new people via events at Yale Connect. \n\nHaving a group of friends is important but also focusing on what you want to do at Yale is also important - I still believe that friends will come along as long as you're open to it :)",

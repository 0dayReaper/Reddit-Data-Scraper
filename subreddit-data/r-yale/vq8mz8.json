There are also a few first year seminars that I\u2019m really interested in, but I\u2019m wondering if those count toward any specific major (like would Six Pretty Good Selves count towards WGS?)",

If this is the case, it *would* be harder, though definitely not impossible, to double major.",

Because there are equivalent courses that don't mean you have to take the whole thing",

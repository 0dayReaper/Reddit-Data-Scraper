    "postText": "For anyone looking to move into the New Haven area, I would like to offer a warning from my personal experience. I am not a Yale student, but know several who were renting other apartments in the same building.\n\nThe first thing, and this goes for any agreement you have, is get it in writing. If you don't, they will not honor it. Period.\n\nI lived in an apartment from them for about 9 months. It was what I needed at the time because it was cheep and available at the moment. I was trying to get out of a bad situation for myself. The issues started when the list I was told would be fixed before move in wasn't, and some items on the list never were. It was things like ensuring the windows latched because they were not sized correctly (I had to call maintenance the day I moved in to have this fixed, and still wasn't done properly), the hatchway door replaced so it would actually be useable without lots of bungie cords (never got fixed, had to be creative with bungies to keep it open when moving out because the hallway stairway was to thin to move out.), the start of the bathtub liner peeling away (got much worse by the time I moved out), insulation around the hatchway because there was none (Fixed after a couple of weeks of phone calls). I moved in anyways because I had nowhere else to live and it was the middle of covid. The cold weather comes, and the heat doesn't work. I'm told I need to keep it higher or the style of unit doesn't work. (I'm an engineering student, working as an engineering intern, it was bullshit). This happens three more times and they only send someone who knows the units after I bring in a lawyer. It gets fixed that day. Their regular guy, who was near useless, ended telling me I had to keep the thermostat at 85+ degrees for the unit to work. The person renting above me was an idiot and left his sink running over night with the plug in (not their fault), and there was a hole in my roof. It took  2 months to get them to fix it because I would put in a work order, does first part \"I need to wait for x to dry, 2 days\". Two weeks later I'm still trying to get that next step done, and a lawyer won't touch it this time without upfront payment because they are doing the bare minimum not to break the law. (I talked to 5 lawyers about it, they all told me the same thing). It is the same guy they sent to fix the heater doing these repairs as well. My kitchen electrical stops working when I try and use the oven and the fridge starts running at the same time, guess who they send? Goes and flips every fuse in the house, and my specific one for the apartment rapidly. Burns out a couple of my electronics, tells me it should be fixed now. I have them bring in an actual electrician. Bad fuse (I'd figured that one out, they didn't believe me). Has to order a new one and will be back when it comes in. actually does his job and comes back. To get them to do a work order they wanted you to put it in the online portal. For emergency items (They define as within 8 hours) it still took 48 hours for me to hear form them, much less actually fix the issue. A medium priority, (24-48 hours) took two weeks. They also had a tendency to just show up and expect me to be there. Once I went to the office for work it took an additional 2 weeks because they refused to schedule a time and just waited until they showed up at a time I happened to be there despite my requesting they schedule a time because I am in the office for work.\n\nWhile all this is happening, I also have to put in reports for windows not latching 6 times, sections of wall collapsing, grout coming undone around the sinks and tubs, outlets failing. It was a mess, They didn't clear the driveway or parking lot of snow or ice, and I fell a couple of times (more than 3+ weeks since the last storm. No injury so they didn't have to pay anything. I would call about it the day after when the houses on both sides pf use had been cleared, which both were owned by Pike, and be told they have allot of properties and will get to use when they can. Finally see the guys after 3 days of calling (and not being able to leave because the snow was too high, and the driveway barely wider than my car), and they didn't know the driveway was there, so they couldn't have cleared it. After that they cleared just the driveway, not the parking lot. There were times I could not leave after a storm because my AWD Impreza didn't have the space to make the turn to  leave the parking lot with the snow, and couldn't move backwards because of how much it froze (the wheels would get stuck in ruts frozen at the bottom, so no amount of power would get them going. I had to use cat litter). \n\nAnd this is where the writing comes into play. I find a new place, and ask what it would take to break the lease. I'm told I would have to pay the rent until someone took over, unless I found someone to take over the term of the lease. Refused to give it in writing as it's been company policy forever. I find someone here on reddit willing to, and I warn them it's Pike. I go to Pike to get the paperwork  started, and they changed to conditions. They would not let anyone take over the lease without going through the application process, and I would have to pay $500 of my security deposit. and they would not let someone take over the term of my lease. I would also have to pay the rent unless the next renter did at least a year's lease. I sign the paper fully willing to take them to court if they sign less than an 11 month lease and try to still bill me. It was worth the $500 to get out from them, and I expect the rest of my security deposit will have to fought for because they will nickel and dime me for fixing things I told them about.",

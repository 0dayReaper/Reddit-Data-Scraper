    "postText": "Two friends and I are going to Firefly festival in Dover, DE drive down on Friday 9/23 and back on Sunday 9/25. Headliners are MCR and Green Day Fri/Sat, but the full lineup is also AMAZING- Avril Lavigne, Weezer, Porter Robinson, Big Sean, Haim, Bleachers, and so many more! We have two extra tickets for Friday and Saturday and a campsite, and are looking for new fellow Yalie friends to come with us! PM for ticket price and more info!",

    "postText": "Pepe\u2019s just had their grand opening today of their first store in the DC area, in Bethesda. The interior looked almost identical to the store in New Haven and the pizza was similarly excellent. Highly recommend as a place to visit for any Elis in the DC area.\n\nhttps://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/dine/frank-pepe-opens-in-bethesdas-westfield-montgomery-mall/",

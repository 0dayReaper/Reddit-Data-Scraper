The details regarding the Postgrad associate position aren\u2019t super clear online other than on this [page](https://postdocs.yale.edu/policies/postgraduate-policies). The PGA appointment technically falls under the office of postdoctoral affairs so I am assuming we get similar benefits. Good luck with your interview and PM me if everything works out!! I don\u2019t really know anyone in New Haven and am looking to make friends haha",

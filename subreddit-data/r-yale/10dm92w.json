My immediate post graduate plans included doing chill and/or fulfilling gig work, figuring out how to do things I want to do/have hobbies instead of just watching tv in between deadlines (a much harder transition than I thought it would be!), and just trying to become un-burntout in general. It\u2019s been a hard year, I can\u2019t imagine if I had just done a fellowship or something that I wasn\u2019t actually invested in just because it seemed like the thing I was supposed to do. It\u2019s a big shift to not have your life structured around school. So my advice would be to not think about what you think you should be doing with your time and instead think about what you want to be doing with your time.",

I focused on my mental health and figuring out how I wanted my life to look. I drove uber, worked in restaurants and taught yoga. Nothing overly strenuous and nothing related to me degree. The following summer I reached out to Career Services for some help polishing my resume, and ended up landing a job that I absolutely love. It's remote work and is completely unrelated to my area of study, but aligns perfectly with my passions and skillet. You may not take the same exact path I did, but taking time to reflect is SO worth it.\n\nIt's tempting to rush into the next thing, but for most it's probably best to take time and prevent wasted efforts.",

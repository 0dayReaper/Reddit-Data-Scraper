They are unfurnished and have no overhead lighting, but it is in a pretty safe place in town. All utilities are included in rent and if you ever have a problem Yale faculties is there to help. You\u2019d also have two different fully fenced in courtyards to enjoy. If you have any more questions DM me.",

    "postText": "One of my friends is on a J-1 visa at Yale. They will be at the uni for two years. The Yale health insurance is too expensive for them, and I'm trying to help them find a more affordable health care plan. I would really appreciate any recommendations or any help narrowing it down! As of right now, I don't think they are looking for anything in particular.   \n\n\nHere is the minimum coverage that must be met:\n\n* $100,000 per accident or\u00a0illness\n* A deductible of no more than $500 per illness and a co-pay not to exceed\u00a025%\n* Medical evacuation in the amount of $50,000. *Evacuation* refers to transporting an injured person for medical\u00a0treatment.\n* Repatriation coverage for up to $25,000. *Repatriation* refers to transporting a body to the country of citizenship after\u00a0death.\n\nEDIT: they said that ideally, they'd like to be able to use the doctors at Yale Health",

I'm in a similar situation where I'm coming from France to do post-grad research for the second semester at Yale, so I basically found this coverage from a French health insurer that specializes in abroad Healthcare insurance for 71 Eur/month. Fits Yale's criteria to a tee!",

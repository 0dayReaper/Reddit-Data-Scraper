            "comment": "Hi there! Never took these courses (non-STEM major, just graduated) but there\u2019s a ton of info online. For math, refer here: https://math.yale.edu/undergraduate/first-year-student-resources. Dean Sandy Chang made this guide for pre-meds: https://science.yalecollege.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Advice%20for%20premeds.pdf. Check out this YDN article here: https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2022/10/07/a-guide-to-life-as-a-pre-med-student-at-yale/\n\nBut overall, you have nothing to be stressing out about now. You\u2019ll learn all of this the first week or two at Yale, and your FroCo will show you the ropes. You (hopefully, 99% confident) won\u2019t end  up taking courses that are way out of your league. I believe there\u2019s a preparation course you can take, ONEXYS (https://onexys.yale.edu) to ensure you\u2019re ready in the fall! \n\nGood luck!",

Once you arrive on campus, there are a plethora of advising sources so don't worry (too much) about dropping the ball. Also, Yale has good premed curriculum paths laid out for you that you can follow to complete both premed and Yale requirements.\n\nAs for preparing beforehand - Yale is a marathon, not a sprint. It could be helpful to start early on the curriculum material, but what will really carry you over the finish line over four years is good physical and mental health. This summer might be the last chance you'll have to just chill - premeds do volunteering or research or shadowing during summertime instead of recharging. Do something you value, spend time with your family, because you'll be stuck on the millstone for a while once school starts.\n\n\\- Old premed geezer (Pierson '13 \ud83c\udf89)",

            "comment": "Hi, premed and MCDB major here :) \n\nFor math, if you\u2019ve taken some type of calc (either precalc or calc) in high school, I\u2019d recommend taking the math placement test just to see what calc class the math department recommends you start with. If you haven\u2019t taken calc 1 or 2 in high school but did take precalc, you\u2019d probably want to start with MATH 112 (calc 1) and then take MATH 115 (calc 2). If you did take some combo of calc in high school, you should still take the placement test to see if they recommend starting with MATH 115 or 120 (calc 3). I took calc BC in high school, placed into MATH 120, but just decided to take MATH 115 bc *most* med schools just recommend taking a calc class up to calc 2 (MATH 115). There wasn\u2019t a real reason for me to take 120 other than to learn new math, which I didn\u2019t really care to do honestly. Lots of med schools also require a class in stats. I ended up just taking S&amp;DS 100 (intro stats). I never took a stats class in high school and I thought it was a pretty easy and chill introduction to statistics.\n\nFor bio, there is a placement test \u2014 although I didn\u2019t even end up taking it bc I heard from upperclassmen that the tests are kinda tough. The intro sequence most premeds take is BIOL 101-104. It\u2019s a four class sequence and each class is half a semester. I have mixed feelings about the intro bio sequence, but I do think that I\u2019m happy I didn\u2019t try to place out of it bc at the very least it exposed me to the ~wide~ range of bio profs yale has to offer.\n\nFor chem, there\u2019s also a placement test, but I also didn\u2019t take that. I ended up taking CHEM 161 and 163 (gen chem 1 + 2) and their associated labs my first year. 161 and 163 were basically a review of AP chem. You also have the option to take advanced general chemistry (idk what the course numbers are) or freshman (CHEM 17-) / sophomore (CHEM 220 + 221) organic chemistry if you place out of gen chem. Most premeds usually just opt for regular gen chem though. \n\nI have no idea if physics has a placement test. But most premeds either take PHYS 170 + 171 (university physics for the life sciences) or PHYS 180 + 181 (university physics) and their associated labs. \n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: I just bombarded you with a lot of information, but it\u2019s important to realize premed reqs are completed over four years. While I started my first semester taking gen chem + lab and MATH 115, I didn\u2019t start the intro bio sequence until the spring semester freshman year. I took orgo 1 and 2 sophomore year. And I *haven\u2019t* even taken physics yet (I\u2019m a rising junior). Use this info bc it\u2019s useful, but don\u2019t get too overwhelmed bc you have four years to complete everything. Good luck!!",

            "comment": "From my college experience (and still in) there is really two sets of classes (how I divide them). 1 is gen eds, 2 is core classes. Gen eds are classes that are almost like a requirement before you can continue in your education or other classes. Specifically I had to take calculus 1 and 2 (stem major). But they are not specific to a type of degree. It is much like high school in the way that you will have many different people (going for different degrees) in your calculus class and is more like another high school math class in the sense of setting, but are much faster paced and detailed. Whence you get into your degree program is when you really start to take classes that will pertain to your degree. Whence I took those, I could continue on to some harder courses that requires to have calculus classes taken prior to enrolling in them",

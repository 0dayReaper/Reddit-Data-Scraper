                    "comment": "This, this, 100% this.\n\nI finally came to the conclusion right before my senior spring that if I didn't drop one of my double majors (English/Classics) I was going to have a nervous breakdown. So I did and had a total blast. In addition to the two remaining English classes I had to take, I took a class in design (I had never taken a studio art class before) and Local Flora which was hands down the weirdest, kookiest class I'd ever taken.\n\nFor four hours a week, we bumped down the byways of the small towns surrounding New Haven in two beat up early 1980s Ford Suburbans. So released from campus, we were set free in woods and parkland with field guides. We identified (or at least tried to identify) trees, flowers and leaves, talked about how fast the future was coming at us after graduation, and smoked a lot of weed. \n\nThen we got back in the vans for a return trip to the Forestry School, where we talked with the professor about our experience, and drew pictures of or wrote stories and poems about plant life as our coursework. Someone did a piece of performance art about the poison ivy he stumbled upon and into. \n\nOur final exam was a meander around the woodland behind the Showcase Cinemas in North Haven, identifying, you guessed it, local flora marked by the TA with red ribbon. For sustenance, my best friend Brian and I brought along homemade wine coolers (Fresca and Carlo Rossi white wine from a gallon jug) in opaque Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sippy cups. \n\nThis still feels like some kind of fever dream straight out of the mid-90s, and perhaps it was. But it was precisely what I needed, when I needed it. I got out of my comfort zone and saw for perhaps the first time what I might have been experiencing all along if I'd just let myself explore a little more. Take a few more risks. College is a great time to take intellectual and experiential risks because the guardrails are still there.  \n\nNo one in the nearly 30 years since my graduation has asked me why I took a single goddamn one of my classes. The degree is the point. The degree opens so many doors it will blow your mind. So go ahead. Be weird. Being weird is good.",

I just took intro Linguistics as my \u201cfun\u201d class senior year \ud83d\ude02 I should have taken a page out of your book and done something wild like Local Flora.  \n\nI think another general recommendation though for seniors/all Yale students: find ways to get off campus as often as possible. IM bowling is a great way. I joined the equestrian team and left campus twice a week for practice. Go on every outing your college offers. New Haven/CT is a great area and I should have spent more time getting to know the area.",

Dance showcases in particular I found to be super fun. Also try to go out as much as possible to new bars and see some live music out in New Haven, it's way more enjoyable than any Yale party you'll go to. Volunteer!\n\nDon't join a society- they suck and take up so much of your free time with the same boring bullshit, when you could be having fun new experiences. Only go to senior events if you genuinely want to and think you'll have a good time, don't feel like you have to because its a senior specific event. Feb club is more about the experience and challenge of being an all star than actually going to the parties, and 99% of the events suck so either take on and embrace the challenge or skip it.\n\nOh also do psychedelics and don't be afraid to make new friends in your last two semesters. :)",

It's a wonderful excuse to indulge in good vibes with not only your primary friends (who you should be hanging out with constantly in senior year), but also the peripheral friends and acquaintances you may not have time to see normally, but are nonetheless part of your Yale experience.",

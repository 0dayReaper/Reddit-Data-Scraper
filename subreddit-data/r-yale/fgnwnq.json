    "postText": "President Salovey has just announced Yale's updated policy in response to COVID-19. \n\nMajor changes (copy/pasted from President Salovey's email)\n\n\\-  When spring recess ends and through April 5 at the earliest, classes will be held using Zoom, Canvas, or other online tools. I know classes take many forms across the university, so this shift to online teaching and learning raises many questions. Deans will be communicating with their faculty and students to provide further details in the days ahead. \n\n\\-  We are asking Yale College students to remain at home after spring recess. For undergraduates who are on campus now, please make every effort to return home as soon as possible, and no later than Sunday, March 15. Yale College Dean Marvin Chun will be providing additional details in the coming days. Undergraduates will have the support of the university in meeting their academic requirements remotely while at home. I understand that some undergraduates consider New Haven to be their home or cannot leave the university at this time. The Yale College Dean\u2019s Office will provide separate instructions for these students, who also will take their classes online.\n\nGraduate and professional students are encouraged to remain off-campus and participate in online instruction, unless required to be on campus due to the nature of their research or academic programs. More information is forthcoming from the deans of each school.\n\nThe university will remain open and continue to provide custodial and limited dining services. \n\n\\-  University-sponsored travel is now prohibited (Travel is considered university-sponsored if it draws on a university-administered funding source.)",

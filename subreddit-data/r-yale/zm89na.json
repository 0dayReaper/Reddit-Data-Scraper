    "postText": "A friend at Princeton took a class called \"Causes of War\" this last semester - I was wondering if there was something similar at Yale. On that note, I'm also open to any classes on war with an economic flavor to it (answering questions such as how war affected economic policy or broader macroeconomics), so feel free to hit me with recommendations!",

I found an old syllabus online which looks like what I remember. I also second the Civil War and Cold War recommendations.",

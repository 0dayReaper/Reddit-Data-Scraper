How do you talk about your interests, what kind of person are you, are you interested in the prestige or the opportunity, etc. It\u2019s horrible awful advice because it\u2019s so cliche but \u201cBe your genuine self and don\u2019t be a dick\u201d is the best I can offer. Also, don\u2019t stress\u2014this is not something that you can fail and you will do the best when you are relaxed and your natural self. (I know this is basically impossible but hey it is worth trying to do anyway.)\n\nSource: Am AYA interviewer",

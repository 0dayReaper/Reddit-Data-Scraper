I know I can take out a larger loan to cover living expenses, but really trying not to do that. I've been applying to some jobs already (mainly remote non-profit type work), but I've been striking out. \n\nFor students that work and make a living wage: do you have any tips? I've been on the student employment page and there are some research jobs that seem pretty solid (with a pretty good wage), but I imagine it's pretty competitive?",

Reaching out to a professor/lab that I get to be close to has worked for me in the past at securing a job, and some both help mentor you and pay you if you build a close relationship with them.",

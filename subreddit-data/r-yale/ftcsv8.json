            "comment": "Congratulations! New Haven is very livable. It has great access to New York, but it ends up being a whole day anytime you go down to the city, so most don\u2019t go there as much as you might think. And New Haven has a lot of the great things New York has to offer, at smaller scale. A couple of outstanding art museums, particularly the YUAG. Plenty of excellent restaurants with a good variety of price points, atmospheres and cultural traditions. Plus all the academic and cultural cornucopia that is Yale. The Peabody is gorgeous as well, though it is mostly closed for renovations well into next year.\n\nAs urban as New Haven is, it\u2019s good to know, if you like the outdoors, that there is plenty of very accessible and friendly aquatic, biking and hiking fun available close by, with easy little jaunts along West Rock and East Rock, both of which provide amazing views of the city and the sound. A little further, but not far at all, Sleeping Giant has an excellent network of trails of varying degrees of difficulty, many of them affording very pretty views, near and far. There are plenty of seaside pleasures between New Haven and Old Saybrook, with Hammonassett Beach being a wonderful state park on the far side of Madison, 20 miles or so from campus. And greater New Haven has a very active biking community with plenty of excellent road and trail options.\n\nFinally, since you\u2019re going to be a grad student and will likely be around for a while, probably with access to a car, there are so many neat and fun nooks and crannies in Connecticut and further afield easily accessible within an hour or two of New Haven. Approximately 55 miles of the Appalachian Trail runs through the northwest corner, and that is beautiful territory. The Berkshires are great in Western Mass, Rhode Island has plenty of fun stuff, the Cape is a bit further out but available, likewise Boston and points north into New Hampshire, Vermont and even Maine.",

So much to enjoy here in this pretty little patch of land. A lot of bright, inquisitive and innovative people call Connecticut home, and that does not even include the Yale community, which is off the charts in those regards.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone. I've noticed a recent spike in external posts and comments here that could best be described as concern trolling, attempting to inflame opinions among the student body. I would just like to make everyone aware of this: [https://imgur.com/a/iaZfagV](https://imgur.com/a/iaZfagV). I am not implying that all new or external posters or commenters here are part of this, but I think it is best that people be aware that r/Yale and other Yale specific forms of social media might be subject to heavy trolling or brigading.",

Like it or not, the history of the south is a part of the development of the United States and acknowledging the sinister roots of this country yet being proud of the development is what makes this country great (imo). However Columbus is another story. I wrote an essay on who he actually was (It\u2019s funny) and read it if you want to.",

Calhoun was a controversial namesake from the beginning given Yale\u2019s history through the Civil War. The main funder of the college system was Sterling, a Civil War veteran, and the only college he didn\u2019t fund was Calhoun.\n\n3. The name Yale University is so detached from Eli Yale that renaming it does not fundamentally alter public perceptions or commemorations of Eli Yale. He has no statues on campus, his abominable portrait was removed from the YCBA, and his name only comes up in campus in passing in the fight song, the description of some teams as \u201csons of Eli,\u201d and the decreasingly popular term for a Yale student as an Eli, which is now being superseded by Yalie.\n\nThat is not to say the university should ignore the problem or remain static. His legacy should be loudly and publicly confronted and denounced even as it is understood that the name should remain. It is a simple an uncomfortable fact of American and world history that most powerful and important people in the past were deeply flawed and at best participated in horrific structures and practices of repression and violence while being personally opposed. At worst they enthusiastically engaged and strengthened such structures. However, Yale University does not now function as a commemoration to Eli Yale and the name Yale has taken on an entirely new and powerful meaning as a result of the university.",

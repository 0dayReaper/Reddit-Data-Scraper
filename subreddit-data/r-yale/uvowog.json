    "postText": "I\u2019m a prospective student, who will be going to Yale in the coming fall, I found a Yale website saying how Yale offers Adobe Creative Cloud for free for students but it\u2019s a few years old. Do they still offer this? When I try it says \u201caccess denied please contact admin\u201d, is it possibly because I\u2019m a prospective student?",

I would advise that you go out of your way in the first weeks of classes to get to know people in class: go to office hours with somebody, work on the problem set together, etc. For me, the biggest step to getting a good group of friends was joining a club sport. If you aren\u2019t into sports that\u2019s fine; I\u2019m sure any club will give you great opportunities for finding a community.",

There are plenty of students that struggle to make friends, and that\u2019s okay too. Getting involved in clubs / student organizations that match your interests are the most effective way of finding friends.",

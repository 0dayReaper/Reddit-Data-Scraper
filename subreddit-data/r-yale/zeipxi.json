    "postText": "I am a senior who is not in secret society. I thought given the extracurricular positions I had on campus, that I had a good shot, but I wasn\u2019t tapped by any. At the time, the large majority of my friends and people surrounding me were being tapped. It was a horrible feeling. \n\nI want to be able go shrug it off, but sometimes when I am reminded of people I know in prominent landed societies, or really any societies at all, I feel crushed. I end of spiraling and really wasting time going down a rabbit hole of self-despair. Thursday and Sunday nights are also a really difficult time for me.\n\nAny advice on this at all from other seniors and/or alumni?",

Spend that time you\u2019d spend at the society doing something interesting-take a non credit class in ballroom dancing, or volunteer in the community, or read some epic book. Your time is open and flexible in a way it likely won\u2019t be again until you retire.",

The next semester is probably going to still feel pretty shitty given how you clearly feel about the one ending. Your friends are doing something you aren't. That sucks. But long-term, there's likely no impact.\n\nI'm another 10+ years out alum who wasn't in a society, and know there have been no negative impacts from that. I enjoy my life, my wife, and my work. I expect I will be able to make my career and life goals just fine (and if I don't, it's largely based on luck that a society wouldn't have helped).\n\nSocieties are social clubs, and social clubs make connections. But that particular set of connections is not the only ones that matter. Being on a friendly basis with your local bartender is frankly more likely to get you ahead in life than being in Bones.",

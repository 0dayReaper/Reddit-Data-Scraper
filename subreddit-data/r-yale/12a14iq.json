Having a university like Yale, they're definitely has to be a solid amount of stuff to do in the area from nightlife, museums, restaurants, parks, etc. It looks gorgeous, but I'm curious what you all think of it and what to be aware of?",

But for instance last week I saw a play at the amazing Yale Rep with tickets I got for free through the public library. This week, I\u2019m going to a Yale Symphony Orchestra concert with $10 tickets. Yesterday, my bike group and I went up West Rock, where there are extensive hiking and biking trails. Downtown might be where most people live, but with a bike/bus you can experience a lot more.",

            "comment": "To be fair, I am happiest in big cities, but I absolutely hate it here and am counting down the days until I graduate (I'm a masters student). I moved here from nyc without a car, thinking I wouldn't need one because it's a college town, but I ended up getting one a couple months ago because I felt like I was suffocating. Plus without a car your only grocery options are Elm City Market, which is small and pricey, or the Stop and Shop on Whalley, which is abysmal in pretty much every way possible, and overpriced (several of my grocery staples cost more there than they did in new york). \n\nI've lived in several cities that are statistically more dangerous, but I've never felt more unsafe than I do here. There was a drive by shooting at the end of my street a couple months ago, some of my classmates have had break ins, I've had a car follow me down York St late at night, J&amp;B Deli had their windows smashed twice last semester, etc. \n\nNightlife is okay. Clubs/bars are meh and last call is often midnight, but lot of good bands do come through Toad's, College Street Music Hall, and Space Ballroom up in Hamden. There are some good restaurants, but my friends and I typically find that there's not much to do here beyond spending money on food/bars, or going to the musuems (which are great the first couple times but get old fast, you'll quickly find yourself waiting for exhibits to change over). If your idea of fun is eating, shopping, and being home by 9, New Haven would probably be an okay fit. Most of the time for fun we end up just having a kickback at someone's house, or escape somewhere else (NYC, Philly, Boston, Providence, etc) for the weekend when we have time. \n\nI love the outdoors and green space is... lackluster, but there's some good hiking if you drive a couple hours. I'd recommend the beaches up in Rhode Island over the ones in CT. \n\nMost of my classmates share my views, but to be fair we're in a niche program that isn't offered at very many universities and Yale was the only option for a lot of us so we didn't have any choice in the matter of moving here. I've heard a lot of people like it here (a lot of our program staff have been here for decades and seem to enjoy it?) but living here has been miserable for most of my cohort.",

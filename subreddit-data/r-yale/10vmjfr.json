    "postText": "I recently decided to enroll in Yale, and Yale Health will be my primary insurance. \n\nWhat\u2019s psych care like under Yale Health? I have some underlying conditions, and I\u2019d love to know if the university\u2019s plan will cover and take care of my needs as a student.\n\nPlease let me know about your experiences with Yale Health in regard to psych care. I\u2019m really excited to join the university in the fall. Thank you!",

There have been some reforms in recent years but ultimately the staff workers have too many students and not enough time.\n\nThey will certainly cover stuff like medication, especially if you\u2019re already prescribed it, but expect delays in intake appointments. After that, though, you should have semi regular access. I recommend calling as soon as your plan activates to try and set up an intake appointment.",

            "comment": "I use Yale Health as my primary provider. Would not recommend for any health care, psych or not. Severely understaffed, takes months to see any kind of specialist. It's complicated to see even my primary care doctor.\n\nI'm not a student but my understanding is that most undergraduates are pretty unhappy with the level of mental care offered. As faculty I've had students have to miss class because it was the only time that they could make an appointment to see a doctor.",

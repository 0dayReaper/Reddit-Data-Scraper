    "postText": "I'm a prospective student figuring out what school(s) I want to ED to, and I'm not sure how I feel about Yale. Beyond being a world-renowned school with outstanding academics, a unique residential college system, and plenty of resources and top-notch faculty, I'm not really sure what it will be like and if I want to make a binding commitment. I'm worried about sacrificing my ED 1 spot to a school that I'm not sure is totally right for me. \n\nThat being said, I'm wondering if Yale is a truly unique place. Are the people pretentious? Are classes actually small? What makes it stand out above *all* the rest? Is it worth my ED spot, and why?\n\nAny and all feedback is welcomed!",

            "comment": "Learning more about Yale: I would highly recommend visiting Yale for an info session and tour. This is the best way to learn more about Yale.\n\nIs Yale right for you: this is a question that you have to answer yourself. You need to consider what things you value and see if Yale matches with those. As you\u2019ve pointed out, Yale has a lot of pros on academics but maybe it not actually the best for your intended major or career path. Maybe you want to be in a small college or spend your weekends with all your friends at football games. There are many factors to consider and only you know how you feel about them.\n\ncommitting on ED/EA: I think you should look at all the schools you want to apply to then make a decision using one of the following strategies: apply to the max number of non exclusive EA, apply ED/EA at your number one choice, or apply EA at one of your reach schools. The first I think is best if you are rather anxious about getting in somewhere sooner than later. The middle option is what most people should do which is applying early at your top choice. If you don\u2019t have a clear top choice, I\u2019d apply to a school that is a reach that is amongst your top picks. Applying early can signal interest that could help improve your chances of getting in. I would not do the first or third strategies with anywhere with binding ED since admitted students days can be great for figuring out if the school is a good fit. When I applied, ND and Yale were my top choices so I ended up applying to Yale EA. I ended up not getting into ND on RD but got into Yale RD after getting deferred and do not regret it one bit.\n\nIs Yale a unique place: I\u2019d say yes, in some ways it\u2019s similar to the other ivies but in some ways it is different and I don\u2019t think you can find anywhere else with the exact experience that I had.\n\nAre people pretentious: There are a few but most aren\u2019t and it\u2019s certainly less of a problem than you are worrying about. You also will run into that at almost any school even ones of lower caliber.\n\nAre classes small: depends on the class. Some intro classes are large but most classes are small lectures and seminars.\n\nWhy does Yale stand out above the rest: For me it\u2019s the perfect combination of location in a small city with a big city near by, academics which are rivaled by very few, the size of the student body is not too big yet not too small, the diversity in backgrounds of the students, the friendly general atmosphere of the school, the shared academic curiosity, strong alumni network, and the residential college system. There\u2019s just a lot at Yale that was great.",

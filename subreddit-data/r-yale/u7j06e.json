For us admitted students, how many extracurriculars should we realistically expect to be able to commit to? What is the maximum you've seen? I know this varies based on how committed each extracurricular is, but I would love any anecdotes or numbers or anything!",

In my experience, most don't have any sort of requirement with respect to the amount of time you spend on them, though if you sign up to do some project you're pretty much obligated to finish it. I've had weeks where I've worked twenty hours on single projects and I've had weeks barely having anything to do with non-course-related stuff.\n\nMy advice: If you run into a club you're interested in joining, just ask them!",

Don't join YUDI lol. YPU is probably in a worse state than when I was there not so long ago, the point of the YPU is to join and find a home in a political party, not to actually participate in the YPU.",

If u know a finance career is you, go for YSIG, if you\u2019re iffy on it and like the YUDI ppl more do that as it\u2019s not impossible to get to Wall Street from there.",

The Record (satire magazine) is also a great organization. If the Cinemat has anything going on during Bulldog Days, definitely check them out, too. The Yale Political Union has a lot of debate events if you're politically inclined. The Yale Debate Association is also absolutely something you should look at. Not sure about finance -- maybe the Yale Entrepreneurial Society? For research I would just recommend taking your classes, finding something interesting in them, and asking your professor/a professor that has more to do with that thing if they'd like to take you on.",

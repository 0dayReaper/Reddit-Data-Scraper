    "postText": "Hi! I was deferred from Yale, and have been asked to send my mid year transcripts. My school has a schedule that consists of 6 classes, but this year I loaded up and took 8(a 0 and 7th hour in addition to the built in 6). 6 of these classes are AP courses, the other two are my elective courses. I just finished my first semester, and hardest semester yet, with 7 As and one C in AP calculus AB. I am really nervous about this grade, and there have been many reasons why it ended this way. How do I explain this to Yale, and is there any chance at all that I\u2019ll still get in? If not, I\u2019m wanting to apply Early Decision II to one of my other reach schools. Thank you so much for your help!!",

If so, they might have more insight into whether you should EDII or not. You sound super accomplished. Good luck!",

For more context, I am applying as a women\u2019s, gender, and sexuality studies major with a double in German studies. I\u2019m not sure if this will be relevant to your advice, but I thought I\u2019d mention it. Thank you so much!",

The one across from loose leaf. I liked it here. Good haircut, decent conversation, good price. But make sure you being cash! They don't accept card or an app payment? They were nice about it though, and let me leave to go get cash.",

At a place like Yale you never know when a great opportunity is gonna fall in your lap. Trust me, as much as the rest of the Yale folks may not like what I\u2019m about to say, if you look like a goober, people won\u2019t respond well to it or trust you as much. \n\nTl;Dr: Go to Greenwich or NY unless u want to gamble with your looks",

    "postText": "Hi folks, \n\nI'm graduating with a PhD in May and was wondering if anyone has the \"Yale blue\" doctoral gown and might be willing to lend or rent it to me for a day. I'm located in NYC and happy to pay shipping costs here and back: it's still wildly less expensive than the literally $1k official robes that our august institution is offering for purchase :) \n\nThanks in advance!",

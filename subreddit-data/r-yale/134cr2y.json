    "postText": "Hi! I am debating rn between Yale and Stanford (yikes one day left haha) and I was wondering: how academically rigorous is it to major in econ at Yale? Is it hard to maintain a high GPA in this major and generally get As in classes? Also, for those doing an econ major, do you feel that you have free time/ time to go to lots of social events frequently? Thank you so much!! :)",

You\u2019ll be able to do it + add on another major (or something like the data science certificate) without issues.\n\nI want to emphasize what one of the other commenters said though: you absolutely don\u2019t need to major in Econ to recruit for banking / consulting. The point of going to a prestigious school is precisely that what you study *doesn\u2019t* matter \u2014 firms will assume you\u2019re smart and interview you anyways, so long as your GPA is passable.",

Even then, classes like Microeconomic Theory, which is the harder version of Intermediate Microeconomics for Econ and Math majors, is pretty challenging, especially if you care about learning more than a grade. If you want to go down the \"keeping finance and more technical roles as options\" route, I would also look at Applied Math as a double major or doing the joint in CS and Econ. Also remember that we have a certificate for data science, which would be far less burdensome to get than a double major.",

Other than that, the harder courses are still pretty doable. The curves are also very generous\u201450% get an A- or A in intermediate courses.",

    "postText": "For all the prospective students asking the worst part of Yale, this is it (I'm not sure I'm even kidding). \n\nIn the past week I have received emails from (and I'm not even gonna include the ones from the YDN newsletter or YCDO and associated groups):\n\n---\n\nRisa Sodi\n\nYES Startup Incubator \n\nThe Chellows (???)\n\nApply-to-be-a-FOOT-Leader (crucially, I did not do FOOT. I have never expressed interest in FOOT)\n\nDatamatch\n\nAlder Eli Sabin (actually a nice dude, no shade at him personally)\n\nThe Yale Political Union (I have never been to any of their events)\n\nThe Good Life Center\n\nMedflyt \n\nYale Review of International Studies\n\nAfAm House\n\nThe Yale Library\n\nYale Alumni Fund Student Ambassadors (to advertise their \"non-profit basics\" course\n\nStephanie Spangler (with yet another covid \"update\" that doesn't actually contain any new information)\n\nYCC\n\nThe Yale Drama Coalition at Yale \n\nthe Asian American Cultural Center \n\nthe Yale YDSA\n\nThe Schwarzman Center\n\nThe Guest Curator \n\nThe Office of the Associate Vice President for Student Life\n\nShip\n\nSomething advertising the first-year mixer (I'm not even a first-year)\n\nsome dude named \"dylan\" about renting summer storage at Yale??\n\nBrick Oven Pizza\n\n---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnyone saying \"yeah just block them tho,\" I hear you but that's not my point. Why the fuck can anybody with a [\"](https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/weekend-update-segment---chris-farley-as-bennett-brauer/n26999)club\" or \"website\" or \"nonprofit\" just access everybody's email address and clog their inbox with unsolicited and unwanted mail? I understand that Marvin Chun or Ronnell Higgins has to send out university-wide updates on occasion but seriously what the fuck? In all likelihood, I do not care about your club, your group, your initiative, your project, your website, your basics of shoe-tying course, the newly open audition for the role of mourner #2 in Angels in America, the now-live application for the Yale \"nonprofit to make you seem like more than just the money-hungry proto-consultant that you are\" fellowship. I do not give a single fuck. I'm telling you this. At MOST, send me one email to make me aware of your existence as an email address, if I am interested, I'll get back to you. As it is now, stuff like this well makes up over 90% of my inbox, getting an email notification doesn't even mean anything to me anymore. I hardly read any. \n\n\\*exhale\\* Any advice on how to de-list my email or something similar would be appreciated. Peace and love to all.",

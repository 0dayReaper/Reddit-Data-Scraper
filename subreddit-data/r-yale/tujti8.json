I keep on asking myself whether I truly deserved this sport, even though I worked my ass off, it seems heartbreaking others that are literal child prodigies are rejected but a mediocre rural HS applicant gets accepted.

            "comment": "Hi I'm class of 25, and from what you're describing you're having the experience I had last year. (Also from rural hs, still wrestling with terrible imposter syndrome) I know hearing that other people go through it and are going through it won't make it go away, but know you aren't alone. It's a really weird pressure, to look at an insane  acceptance rate and know you're one of the ones in that select few. You feel you must have cheated somewhere somehow, without even meaning to. The alternative, that you were simply remarkable enough to find yourself in this position, feels a bit impossible. \nIn dealing with imposter syndrome lately in been trying to build on a metaphor I heard a man named Brennan Lee Mulligan use. Imposter syndrome is a big scary mean dragon guarding the door to an enormous treasure room of confidence and self acceptance. The trick is to realize that you don't have to fight the dragon. You can walk away from those feelings, and just focus on finding other doors. One door might lead into \"learning violin\" or \"becoming a good writer\" or \"being a good friend\" and many will not be guarded by scary dragons. Then you spend a lot of time with the treasure of doing something you love, like playing the violin, and you realize there's a little door at the back. And you open that door and it takes you to a back passageway into the treasure room of confidence and self acceptance. \nOne day you might be strong enough to slay the dragon. But it doesn't make you a bad adventurer if you can't right now, or ever. You can live with the dragon, and keep moving, and eventually you'll get to somewhere. \nI hope something in this rambling mess of a comment helps. If nothing else, writing it out helped me",

I have no awards beyond state/regional level, no research or internships, and yet I\u2019ve seen so many kids with those get rejected so many times. Just know you\u2019re not alone, I think it\u2019s very common in these kinds of schools and I know we\u2019ll find our place on campus next fall.",

Enjoy contributing to the community, learning from others and working hard on what interests you.  Imposter syndrome among my classmates ( and I include myself here) was very common.  This is true for students admitted from all backgrounds, including those that seem impressive.  Perhaps Yale selects for extreme modesty or insecurity in an individual!",

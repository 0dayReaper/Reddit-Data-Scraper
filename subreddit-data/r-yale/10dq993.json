    "postText": "Hello! I am looking to understand what life is like at Yale, to help determine where is a good fit to do my PhD. \n\nI have some questions in mind for current students: Do people typically walk from campus to town or are cars more commonly used? How is public transport? Does the nearby New Haven area \u201cfeel\u201d like a campus town? How do you feel about the off-campus accommodation options? Are the biology/biomed field profs generally friendly, collaborative, and excited to talk about their research with students? \n\nThank you in advance :)",

Good connection to NYC tho\n\nDoes the nearby New Haven area \u201cfeel\u201d like a campus town? \n\nYes, where most grads live (mainly east rock then downtown, wooster square)\n\nHow do you feel about the off-campus accommodation options? \n\nPrices went up, but studio/one bed affordable and available with stipend\n\nAre the biology/biomed field profs generally friendly, collaborative, and excited to talk about their research with students?\n\nno idea",

Used to commute by city bus from out in hamden and east haven, and seldom had problems. I think Yalies in general are a bit...shy about mixing with locals, but it means they miss out.",

What I want to say is that there is no proper public infrastructure (tram, subway), and you are to 99% better of just walking or cycling somewhere.",

CT public transport isn't the best. Downtown does feel very much like a college town. \nThere are many accommodation options in many different price ranges.",

    "postText": "Hello Bulldogs! \n\nI'm an incoming freshman at Yale considering a double major in EECS and BENG. Is it manageable? I know it is extremely hard but ill def need both of these majors for my future research interest and career. Any advice, experiences, or insights from those who have pursued or considered this combination would be greatly appreciated. I'm eager to make an informed decision and make the most of my time at Yale. Thank you!",

            "comment": "Hi! Welcome to Yale!!\n\nI\u2019m going to be honest and say that double majoring in EECS and BENG does not sound manageable to me. Students take 36 credits over their four years\u2014EECS requires 15 credits and BENG requires 13, excluding prerequisites (which, depending on your pre-Yale preparation, is an additional ~5-8 credits). Not to mention you\u2019re only allowed to \u201cdouble dip\u201d (allow a class to count for multiple majors) twice, and you still have to complete your distributional requirements. Even if you were to find a way to make it work, you would have almost zero room for exploration and taking other, random courses that interest you.\n\nMy personal suggestion would be to find a particular track within one of these majors that satisfies your interests or try to find other ways to blend the two (e.g. BENG major with a programming certificate). You can also talk to your Dean/advisor once you get on campus for other options.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a CS and S&amp;DS major, but I have friends in either major. I\u2019ll take a crack at what would be needed coursewise for this combination.\n\nFor the sake of argument, I\u2019m going to assume you\u2019ve taken AP Calculus and some computer science course in high school. Including prereqs and core courses, this would still amount to 18 credits of EECS (15 core + PHYS 180/181 + MATH 120) and 15 credits of BENG (11 credits of 13 core courses + PHYS 205L/206L + ENAS 194 + BIOL 101/102 + CHEM 161). \n\nThat adds up to 33 credits between just the two majors, and that doesn\u2019t include distributional requirements. The majors cover math and science, but you still need 2 cr writing + 2 cr humanities + 2 cr social science + 1-4.5 cr language (depending on placement). Still assuming the best-case where you place into an L5 language, possible with an AP 5, the total number of credits needed is 40 credits. That\u2019s more than a Yale student typically takes to graduate, and it\u2019s a best-case scenario that doesn\u2019t include electives.\n\nEven though it is technically possible to take 40 credits at Yale, it is probably impossible to fit all of the necessary prereqs into your 1st/2nd year schedule while still meeting the year-by-year distributional requirement schedule: you have to have 1 credit in all 6 areas by the end of sophomore year, only 2 of which are covered by the majors. Yale only even recommends you take 4-4.5 credits in your first semester and even first year if possible\nBesides, I think this kind of combination would be rather academically challenging/stressful, but that\u2019s just me.\n\nI don\u2019t think that double majoring like this is needed to make the most of your time at Yale. I\u2019m only double majoring because I would be taking those courses anyway and the number of total courses for the majors is feasible (23 credits). \n\nIt\u2019s rather uncommon for engineers, and students in combined majors like EECS, to double major. A lot of the time, Yale\u2019s certificate program (basically a minor) is a great compromise since it only requires 5 credits. The selection is limited, but programming is on the list.\n\nIf you have any more course/major questions, I\u2019d be happy to give them a shot. You\u2019re welcome to message me.",

You should have room for a couple after considering the EECS courses and distributional requirements. \n\nIt\u2019s very accessible here to take departmental electives that other schools may restrict access to, messaging the professor as needed. You also can get some electives from another department to count towards your major, but that\u2019s a case-by-case thing.",

I\u2019m not a major in either field (math + cs personally) but i did a quick search up of each major and it looks like each individually requires *at least* 13 courses, not counting the prerequisite courses. you\u2019d likely be looking around 26-30 courses just to do both of these majors, and the typical yale student takes a total of about 36 credits in their time here. that leaves you very little space to do all of your distributional requirements and would probably make for a super hellish workload every semester. unfortunately i dont think it\u2019s super feasible to work on that double major, especially since EECS is already kind of a double major in itself (electrical engineering and computer science). sorry if that\u2019s not what you wanted to hear, but i hope it was helpful!",

            "comment": "I would actually say you can if you want to. Based on other comments it does not look impossible; you just have to take more classes than needed and prioritize academics more than the average student. 36 credits is actually super easy to finish. I know enough people who took upwards of 45 credits (including engineering); it can work.\n\nThe other part of this is that everyone comes into Yale trying to double major with a certificate  in three languages and a dual Master's degree. I think at most a third of this population commits to their plan. Most people in college realize that there is so much more to college than studying and they do not need to get those specific majors to satisfy their own academic/professional objectives. And that is okay! I think you should come into Yale wanting to do everything you possibly can, and then trim down/alter as you mature and find yourself more. You don't need to make a decision anytime soon and that is the blessing of this curriculum.",

With the exception of Medical Device Design, I doubt you\u2019d have any trouble getting into any BENG classes as an EECS major, assuming you\u2019ve completed the pre reqs (bio, chem, etc). At least back in my day, Medical Device Design was a very popular class, and not everyone got in, so you may have to try multiple times (both your junior and senior years).",

Check out the canvas page, maybe there are instructions like \u201csend me an email with your year and why you want to take the class.\u201d I just remember sending a bunch of emails. 1. Read the syllabus and canvas page carefully 2. Follow the instructions (if none just send the prof an email with a little bit about u, year, interested, blah blah)",

Most of them are higher-level classes and so it is mostly to check that you have the necessary experience and actually want to do the class. If the class has no prerequisites, it's mostly a way to pick those that are \"most interested\" in the class rather than whoever can mash the \"take class\" button first.",

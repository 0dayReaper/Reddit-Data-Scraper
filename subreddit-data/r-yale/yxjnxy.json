    "postText": "I recall several performances of the Whiffenpoofs song in which when they sing the line \u201cAnd the magic of their singing casts it\u2019s spell\u201d someone shouts \u201cAvada kedavra!,\u201d and someone else pretends to drop dead and remains on the floor for the rest of the song. But I can\u2019t seem to find this anywhere on YouTube. Does anyone know where I can find a video of this? Or perhaps I am thinking of something else?",

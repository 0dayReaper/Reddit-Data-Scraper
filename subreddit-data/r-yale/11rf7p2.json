    "postText": "Hi, all. I applied for a position at the university on March 1st and the job closed for further applications a couple of days later. In terms of the hiring process, when should I be looking to hear back? If I do get an interview, how will they contact me? Just looking for some general information about the hiring/interview process. Thanks!",

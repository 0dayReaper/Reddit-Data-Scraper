What is also sad to me is that many of us would not have seen these words or spent much thought on them had she not have passed, weird value we place on death right there.  A loss to the world, my apologies Ms. Keegan; too young.",

I just had a strange impulse to visit this subreddit today and saw this. I can't tell you how oddly beautiful and serene and tragic it felt reading over this piece for me. That coupled with the thought that this young woman is gone; I echo your sentiment and doubly so.\n\nTruly sad. RIP.",

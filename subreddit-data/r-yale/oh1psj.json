My biggest accomplishments are winning the National Ocean Science Bowl and doing research and potentially getting a second author pub.\n\n2. Does applying as a STEM major provide like a small hook?

It might give a near-negligible boost based on the AO's biases, but for all realistic purposes, your chances of getting in SCEA are the same as RD.\n2. No. Yale doesn't admit by major, so you have an equal shot at getting in regardless of your major.",

You may not need to consider the subject as strictly academic, and may consider engaging with it in a more academic fashion in the future. It is an opportunity to tell a story about a topic/idea that interests you to put it simply.\n\n\"Why do these academic areas appeal to you?\" is a slightly more direct question where you should explain why you have listed your intended majors and link them to what you currently study in school/what you do outside the classroom and explain why you see yourself studying such subjects at Yale.",

I've been out of the academic realm for quite some time and am intending to apply via the Eli Whitney Program with the intention of attending SEAS for what I expect will be a mechanical engineering degree. For background purposes, my work has been focused around residential energy efficiency practices, subcontracting for the Department of Energy in CT &amp; MA.   \n\n\nI'm hoping there might be people within this community who would be willing to speak on their experience with the Eli Whitney application process and/or the engineering program in general.  \n\n\nTIA",

Since not a lot of students I know have gone to the US I am having a tough time getting my Essay reviewed. I was wondering if some of you could please give it a read for me and tell me how it sounds?  \nSome basic info:  \nI'm writing the last prompt so it's a custom topic.  \nMy essay is about 5/6 words over the word limit so once you are done reviewing it I'll change it up a little.  \nI'm applying as a computer science major mainly aiming for Computer Science Engineering.  \nThanks in advance to anyone who gave this time! Please PM me for the link to the document.",

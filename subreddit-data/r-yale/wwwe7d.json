            "comment": "The Film &amp; Media Studies major focuses mainly on film. I've taken a few excellent courses that focus heavily on media theory and criticism, which could be up your alley, but as far as credit goes, you HAVE to take courses that are listed within the Film Department.\n\nIf you're not interested in documentary filmmaking, I would say to go for English. Maybe PoliSci depending on your ECs. English seems to be much, much more flexible in terms of course offerings and what they count as credit. I'm also saying Political Science because that's the major that a lot of the journalism people I know have, I suppose because regardless of what you major in you'll have to do a good amount of writing at some point. Even if journalism isn't a focus in whatever you decide to major in, you can also just get involved in student journalism. Most extracurricular groups here are incredibly welcoming.\n\nThat being said, someone that's more knowledgeable about the other writing-focused majors at Yale should weigh in before you take my opinion with more than a grain of salt. This is just what I've seen.",

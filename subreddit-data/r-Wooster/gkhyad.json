            "comment": "If you\u2019re not maintaining a 2.0 or above, you\u2019re either not trying, constantly hung over, or have outside problems. If you are able to get in, you\u2019re going to have the brains to do the work at a decent level. Only people I knew that didn\u2019t maintain over a 2.0 either left after their first year or were experiencing extensive personal, health, or family problems. That said, it is possible to book a class load that will stress you out, but most academic advisors are pretty proactive about not letting you do more than you can handle.\n\nYou can rent most text books, which is a bit of a raw deal, but it\u2019s still cheaper than buying. Otherwise you\u2019ll need to surf the high seas (arrrgg) or spend some quality time at the copy machine.",

I\u2019m not sure what the textbook selection is like in ClevNet but you\u2019ll definitely have access to more resources than a typical library in a town the size of Wooster.",

I tested out of foreign language requirement.\n\nIt was all computer based, kind of duo lingo-ish. I took it like 9 years ago though. Someone else may have taken it more recently. I almost wish I hadn\u2019t tested out as I probably would have received much better German instruction at Wooster than I had in HS.",

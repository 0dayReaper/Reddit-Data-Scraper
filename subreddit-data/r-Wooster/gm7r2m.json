If you need your student ID number, that is accessible by going to scotweb.wooster.edu, signing in, clicking students then \u201ccolleague self service\u201d that has all student ID info. But if you\u2019ve boy been to campus and had a physical ID made, a student ID cannot be generated for you.",

At the moment, Wooster is transitioning more and more things over to Self Service and has been for the last year or so, so I can\u2019t guarantee this won\u2019t change but right now there is no way to do that. When you go to security and protective services in the fall to move in, you\u2019ll get your physical cow card. You cannot as your student account to any electronic management service because at the moment Wooster does not have any means of generating an e-card. It wouldn\u2019t likely be useful for you anyway, everything at Wooster requires physical presence of the card with either a swipe, a tap, or a scan to do things with it.",

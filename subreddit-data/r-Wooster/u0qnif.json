            "comment": "Hi friend I am a current student at the Wooster geology department and I\u2019d like to share a little bit about my experience here to help you out with your decision. \n\nThis department is really old and super nice. It was founded in the 19th century and is one of the earliest geology department being established in a small liberal arts college like Wooster. We got a total of four faculty members and every single one of them is nice and can help you a lot in both your study and your life here at Wooster. Our department is very strong in terms of the academia and is equipped with some of the top-tier research facilities for such a small liberal arts institution such as the XRF and XRD. On top of that, you can conduct your own research here even early in your freshman year. \n\nIn general, this is a place full of opportunities and nice personals if you can discover in the right way.\n\nHope to see you soon at Wooster.",

I can only imagine the tenured faculty are even better.",

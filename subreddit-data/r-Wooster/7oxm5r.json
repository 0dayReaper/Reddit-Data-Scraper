    "postText": "Well, I was given 'top prospect' status a month ago and upon reviewing COW myself I've chosen to apply there. I have a question though, it roots from discrepancies from the emails I have received from the Admissions Office itself.\n\nIt basically boils down to this: I can afford around USD2k-3k per annum. Is it even worth applying here since I can't exactly study there if my family has to pay larger than that amount.\n\n(SAT1490, SATII2380, 4.0/4.0, top rank, all that sub-national ECA jazz)",

I\u2019ve seen people get up to 90% of cost covered, not a lot, but a few. I would say even if you get it to a point where you still have full room/board costs to pay, some responsible borrowing could definitely get you there.\n\nShort answer, you\u2019ll probably never get the aid to a point where you can pay just 3k per year, but you might get it to a point where you can pay 3k per year cash and borrow 15-30k over the course of your time at Wooster. Outside chance. But you\u2019ll never know unless you apply.",

Because this sub doesn't get a ton of readers and the financial aid office would know better than anyone, especially because you're an international student so different rules may apply and they'll have all the information necessary to give you good advice. Not that you're intentionally withholding information here, but there may be information that they recognize as relevant that you might not see.  ",

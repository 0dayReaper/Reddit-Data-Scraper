    "postText": "Please be aware of the colleges lack of care for its current students. The dorms you stay in for visits and shown thru tours are not the lux dorm rooms you are promised once they take your money. \n\nAs an alumn here are my own horrendous housing experiences:\n-my freshman dorm\u2019s heat stopped working mid January and took until beginning of March to get this fixed. My room was about 60 degrees and required hats, gloves, jackets just to exist in there. Sleeping was near impossible. Yes I did talk to housing. Their literal response was we need to move our furniture to expose the heat ducts, except our room was literally too small for that to happen. It took parental complaints and threats to get this resolved almost two months later. \n\nLiving in Holden- there were always bats in the bathrooms. The protocol was to contact security. They don\u2019t fix the source of the issue and blame the students opening windows in 90-100 degree weather in a brick building with no ac. \n\nCampus housing is so unsafe and unreliable they let their houses go to rot. The entire first floor of Lewis house collapsed in 2015-16 school year due to the amount of people at the party. \n\nThe student news paper recently published the dismissal of these ongoing complaints in 2021-22 school year. The bat problem was increased in spread throughout Holden. Compton has black mold. A lot of paint is still leaded and dusting or peeling off student living spaces. \n\nDo you think it\u2019s acceptable for the price this campus is charging? \n\n[Bats in Holden- the college asks for students to compromise student\u2019s comfort who live in a 100 degree brick oven.](https://thewoostervoice.spaces.wooster.edu/2021/09/17/bats-infrastructure-and-lead-concern-students-in-res-life/)\n\n[A tour guides perspective on Woo\u2019s renovation priorities.](https://thewoostervoice.spaces.wooster.edu/2021/09/17/lowry-a-performance-oriented-renovation/)",

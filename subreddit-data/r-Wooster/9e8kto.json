            "comment": "The environment at Wooster is largely what you make it. It's a school in a relatively sleepy, smallish town, and the college reflects that -- you have to work a bit to find a lot of things to do.  \n\nThat said, Wooster abounds with a variety of people from a variety of backgrounds, and the people are really great. I live in a large city now and many of my current friends and connections (even 5+ years after graduating) are due to my time at Wooster.  \n\nRegarding the business program, your son will get a good background in business and economics as well as a well rounded liberal arts education. Working in tech and business, this can be a huge benefit, and if grad school is on the radar (as it should be for someone majoring in business) then Wooster is a great piece of the puzzle.   \n\nOne potential drawback could be internship opportunities -- I'd expect a school in a larger city would have lots of local connections for internships.  \n\nRegarding career placement after Wooster, it's important for a student to start working with career services early and often to get maximum benefit from their office. The student has to take the initiative here. The office is okay at what they do but they won't reach out to help, the student really needs to own that relationship in my experience.  \n\nGood luck with your college search! ",

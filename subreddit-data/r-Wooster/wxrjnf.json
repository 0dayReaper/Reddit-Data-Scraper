If so what streets, area, side of campus are good for students to live on if they can get an exemption to living in the dorms. Has anyone ever done this? Any advice?",

They aren\u2019t kidding about being a residential campus.\n\nThere are non-traditional (not dorm) apartment and house living options available through res life, but you will not live there your first year. I think the only people who actually consistently get an exemption are actual Wooster residents. I don\u2019t think I knew anyone in 4 years who actually lived in housing not managed by res life. If you\u2019re looking for that experience, this may not be the right fit for you.",

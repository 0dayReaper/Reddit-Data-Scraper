    "postText": "I recently got an email from The College of wooster saying :\"Your successful high school career so far has earned you a spot on the list of **top prospects** \". I am an international student who needs aid to attend US universities and a CS major . This email was so out of nowhere that I am very curious and want to know more about this college. \n\nFor anyone that knows about or attends this college: How is its CS program? Does it have a good enviorment for international students? Is it recognisable ? \n\nAny and all information is appriciated.",

            "comment": "I graduated in 2019. I loved Wooster but it's definitely not for everyone. I can't speak on its CS major but I can a bit on it's internal student population and reputation.\n\nWooster has a large international student population for a small liberal arts school. I've heard mixed reviews from international students on how they've enjoyed their experience. Please note that Wooster is in the middle of nowhere but is about equal distance (1h 30min) to several large Ohio city's. But for the most part you will remain on campus and if that sounds unappealing at all then I'd highly recommend looking elsewhere. \n\nReputation wise is a little challenging. In my experience, people who have heard of Wooster absolutely love it and only have positive things to say about the college and its students. However, it is very small and many people have not heard of it. That being said, the majority of  alumni would bend over backwards to help another Wooster student due to the small and close connections they feel towards their alma mater.\n\nYou could call the administration office and speak with someone, or better yet call the alumni office and request to talk with an international student who majored in CS. I'm sure they'd be happy to connect you with someone who is from a similar background or who has similar interests to you so you can better make your decision. \n\nDM me if you have any additional questions. I'd be happy to help however I can.",

            "comment": "I started at Wooster with the intention of declaring as a CS major. While I eventually switched and went for History instead (graduated with the class of 2019) my first year I took a few CS classes. While I can\u2019t say extensively how good the program is, I can say I had a good experience in the classes I did attend, and the professors that taught them were good. \n\nWooster also has a pretty diverse campus when it comes to international students. Way more than you might expect from a small college in the middle of rural Ohio, but it has many international students and faculty. I\u2019m from the U.S. so I can\u2019t speak for what kinds of support the college provides for its international students.\n\nI do hope you consider going. I don\u2019t know exactly what your situation is, but worst case if you don\u2019t like it, you can hopefully transfer. The international students I knew seemed to like it there, and the CS program is active enough that I would assume it\u2019s decent enough compared to other schools its size.",

    "postText": "Ive been having second thoughts on the college I was planning on going to, and was wondering what current students have to say about the performance of Wooster in these areas:\n\nDorms: are they properly air conditioned &amp; ventilated? Does anyone have mold? Are they cramped? How are bathrooms? Are there any dorms with a kitchen/communal space-sort of apartment style maybe? Do the windows open? How thin are the walls?\n\nFood: how is the food? I am a picky eater and wonder how satisfactory you find the food there? Do you eat it as it? Do you grab something and alter it to make it better and eat it? Do you give up if the menus bad that day and go hungry? How easy is it to cook in dorms? \n\nLife and other: are there fun things to do around town? Any cool school groups or clubs you especially like or think are cool? My interests are more eclectic than most so I want to know if there\u2019s a good variety of things to do at Wooster on or off campus. \n\nAnd: those who procrastinate: how has your experience been at Wooster academics wise?",

            "comment": "Caveat: I haven't been to Wooster in a little while, I graduated a few years ago, so it's possible things have changed since then.\n\nDorms: Some dorms have air conditioning and others don't. I lived in a dorm without AC for all four years. Because most people aren't there in the Summer, I find it's just not that big of a deal, it's only hot for maybe like the first week of the fall semester and the last week of the spring semester. I didn't find it cramped at all, most people live in doubles with one roommate, and maybe one in four rooms is a single where people do not have a roommate. Windows opening and wall thickness is variable and depends on dorm, where I lived the windows opened fine and we had no noise problems. Most dorms have several communal/lounge spaces and one kitchen space now.\n\nFood: People rag on the dining hall food, but I thought it was great. If you are a picky eater, you may have problems, but I am a vegetarian and even with that dietary restriction I consistently liked the options at the vegetarian station. I did alter it all the time, like by adding stuff from the salad bar or hot sauce or something, but I think it would have been fine even if I didn't have those options. It is really not convenient to cook in dorms for meals, I don't know anybody that cooked for themselves for the majority of their meals, but the people who did it most often, it seemed to me, were international students who were missing the taste of home. At least in my dorm, the kitchen often smelled like Chinese food.\n\nLife: There are many fun clubs and student groups, for all sorts of interests, but I gotta say there is not much to do around town. I didn't go off campus much and didn't feel like I was missing much. There's nothing close to the same dive bar culture you might find at Ohio University in Athens. Once I made friends with a car we went to local farms sometimes on weekends to see the animals and pick sunflowers, because yknow, Wooster is amid a lot of farmland. But all the real nightlife is on-campus.\n\nAcademics: I liked all my classes a lot, Wooster has really great faculty. I was a double-major with another minor (maybe that's also partially why I didn't go into town a lot lol), so I have experience across multiple disparate departments. I procrastinated often, but also almost never had to ask for extensions or ended up turning in assignments late, so maybe that puts me at a moderate procrastinator; it was stressful sometimes, but uhh idk I survived and learned a lot.",

            "comment": "Recent grad here as well (pre-COVID) and I'd agree with some of the things others are saying.  Here's what I'd say from my experience:\n\nDorms: Some have AC and some do not.  If you are able to get into a specialty dorm, like the foreign language suites or a program house, I think your experience will be better than a traditional dorm after your first year.  Living in the freshman dorms was alright, but there was no AC and the bathrooms were communal.  They were fairly clean though and no mold.  The dorm windows open and the walls air fairly thin.  At least in my experience, the older dorms allowed sound to travel more than it probably should (or the other students were just really loud).\n\nFood: The food was excellent in terms of dining hall food!  However, this was before they closed down Lowry (I believe it is being renovated currently) and Kittredge Hall.  While the food was repetitive at times, I think they do a very good job at providing a variety of good tasting options.  There are plenty of healthy alternatives and vegetarian choices.  I can't say if it is still like this since the pandemic, but that was my experience.\n\nLife and other: I did not have a car on campus all four years, and the campus events crew did a really good job of having events for students every weekend (movie nights, dances, craft nights, etc.).  My friend had a car her junior and senior year, so we were able to make some trips outside of town.  My friends and I weren't the party type, so we didn't really go out much in terms of that.  I highly recommend getting involved with campus groups.  There are so many!  It will help you make friends a lot, because I felt it was a bit difficult to make friends my first few months there.  There are also always events happening on campus too, like athletic events and theater productions.  Common Grounds was one of the best programs/places on campus.  They are a student run coffee house that hosts board game and video game nights during the week and on the weekends.  It was my hangout place while I was there, and great for those who don't want to party but still want to be social.  There is also a group that conducts \"Humans vs. Zombies\" which is basically a campus wide game of tag with Nerf guns.  It's hilarious to watch and happens twice a year!\n\nAcademics: Overall, COW is a research heavy school, meaning the curriculum preps you for your Independent Study thesis that you will write senior year.  Many grads go on to complete graduate school (possibly more) and the courses do a great job of preparing you for that.  That being said, it will require time and dedication.  You can't get away with doing nothing and not going to class like bigger schools.  However, most faculty will work with you if you are struggling and there are many support systems to get academic help.  The libraries are a great place to get extra help!\n\nMost of the faculty were wonderful and great people.  There are of course some exceptions because not every school is perfect.\n\nHope this helps in your decision.  Good luck!",

            "comment": "I \"graduated\" in 2020 so the school is still fresh in my memory. All things considered, the food is fairly decent but has reduced in options over the last few years. That being said, you'll never go hungry even as a picky eater. If you don't like the cafeteria, you can use your flex dollars at the \"C Store\" which is kind of just like a small coffee shop with some snacks and frozen meals for sale. \n\nI wouldn't get my hopes up for AC in the dorm rooms. The only time I ever had AC in my dorm was when I broke my leg and needed accommodated living in a nicer room. They're pretty small in general but they don't have mold, the windows open, and the walls are usually thick enough to block sound. \n\nThere is almost nothing to do in the town of Wooster. You could go to some restaurants/bars but aside from that you're gonna have to make your own fun. \n\nAcademically, Wooster is HARD. I was not prepared for the level of academic difficulty right out of high school and it took me almost two years to figure out how to get good grades there.",

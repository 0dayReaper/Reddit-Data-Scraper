Also this is my first reddit post!) and I absolutely love it. I think Wooster is right for someone who is dedicated to academics (woo courses can be challenging, but in a good way!), wants a smaller college environment, and wants involved professors who really care about their students. I\u2019ve found Wooster to be quite diverse and as a lesbian, very accepting. \n\nMy only warning would he how small the town is. I\u2019m from a fairly large city so being in a small town environment took a bit of getting used to, but it\u2019s very charming and full of interesting people. \nGood luck on your search! Overall I could not be more happy that I chose to go to Wooster.",

I just don\u2019t want to make a wrong decision when choosing a college (I was suppose to visit Wooster but everything got canceled). I\u2019m just trying to see if I would be a fit for the Wooster community\n\nEdit: I\u2019m also looking at UIUC, Kalamazoo, Denison, Knox, Rhodes if that helps paint a better picture of me",

The curriculum is flexible enough to allow for some significant mixes of studies before you even get to self designed majors.\n\nI would say that Wooster scores pretty good on the the diversity front for its size. The school is almost all on campus housing, which some view as limiting, but it really does encourage tight knit relationships. As far as sports, they\u2019re decently accessible. I think they\u2019re all D3, so actual normal people can play them. \n\nI personally found great success at Wooster.",

            "comment": "I graduated four years ago. Other grads' perspectives may vary, but in answer to your question this was my experience:\n\n-Students who want to work one on one with professors and get pushed academically.\n\n-Students who like to work independently (with a lot of support!). There were plenty of group projects but for much of your junior and senior year, depending on your major, you will be working hard on your solo research, and that can be hard if you aren't good at self motivating. But faculty support is incredible and the librarians are good resources too.\n\n-Students who like to be themselves. Self-expression is a key part of the Wooster experience - lots of quirky students who are passionate about so many things! There are student orgs for everyone, and if there isn't one that speaks to you it is easy to get one going if you and friends have enough interest. Lots of volunteer groups too. This is not a preppy campus, and there are people from all walks of life.\n\n-Students who are ok with seeing the same people every day. It's a small campus. You get to know people and you can't always avoid them ;)\n\nLots of the above could relate to other small liberal arts schools, but if you are looking for a supportive, friendly community that celebrates diversity this is it. I visited a lot of colleges, including some on your list, and Wooster was just so different. My four years there were the same. Super friendly people, I still remember the kindness of all of the dining hall staff, students willing to collaborate for study groups, how the professors would dress up with us and stand and cheer for I.S. Monday, getting invited to faculty and staff's houses for dinner, meeting random nice students at the campus coffee house, etc. Can't say much about sports because I wasn't an athlete, but club sports and intramural were fun there.\n\nGood luck with your decision! I know it must be tough when you can't visit in person.",

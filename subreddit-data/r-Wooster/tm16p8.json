Our Admission Committee welcomes you to submit your application and notify your school counselor so we may provide a decision promptly. Although the app indicates an earlier deadline date, you are still able to submit at this time. There is no disadvantage to applying later; merit scholarships and need-based assistance are still available for all admitted students.",

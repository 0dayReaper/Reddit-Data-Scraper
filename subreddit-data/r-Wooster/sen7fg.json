    "postText": "Hi! \n\nI am an international student in one of the Canadian universities and I am thinking of transferring to the US universities. I finished my 3rd term and am now on leave of absence. \n\nActually, I have been accepted into Wooster with a decent amount of scholarship, but I didn't choose this school. I am now regretting it. :( \n\nDo they accept students like me as a transfer student? And how good the GPA should be? \n\nI am kind of confident in my high school GPA, but not for college one.\n\nThank you in advance !",

            "comment": "Definitely schedule a time to talk with admissions. The fact that you were accepted in the past is a strength. If you don\u2019t think where you ended up is a good fit, that could become a decently compelling narrative to bring up with admissions/financial aid office (and might help explain some of your college GPA performance to date, if you aren\u2019t happy with where it is now).\n\nDefinitely check how many credits will transfer. You might get stuck having to take Wooster\u2019s writing intensive FYS course, as it\u2019s pretty fundamental to how a lot of the programs are structured, but I\u2019m not sure how they handle that with transfers. Not specific to Wooster, but a lot of times transferring will add an extra term/semester to your degree just based on credits transferred, and scheduling necessary courses. If you do go down the road of transferring, make sure to request time with an academic advisor before you commit, as they should help you roughly plan out the rest of your required coursework for the next ~3 years. That way you\u2019ll have an upfront picture of your time/financial commitment.\n\nGood luck \ud83c\udf40",

            "comment": "I would definitely contact admissions and explain your situation.  Wooster makes an effort to accept a lot of international students, so that may help your case.  To my knowledge though, most students there tend to not be transfers and follow the 4-year traditional track of college.  That doesn't mean that they don't except transfers, though! They do, but they may be very particular about what courses they will let you transfer for credit.\n\nI hope it works out for you!",

            "comment": "Wooster does accept transfers so no concerns there! talk to Admissions about the transfer process\u2014you will likely undergo ARCH\u2014the summer registration process for incoming students in June or have separate meetings in December, if transferring for Spring 2023. Part of these meetings will be helping you construct a schedule based off everything Wooster\u2019s Registrar says transfers in.",

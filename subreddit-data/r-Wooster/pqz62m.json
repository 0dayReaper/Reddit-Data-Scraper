    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am a prospective student. I'm closeted trans. I've read that the school is very LGBT+ inclusive, and that they have support groups for queer students. On the website, I've read about their policies regarding pronouns and preferred names. \n\nI know a lot of other colleges have a little sign with the person's name a pronouns on the doors of dormrooms. Assuming Wooster has those, are they up by the time you move in? I'm nervous that if I put my preferred pronouns, etc. during the admissions process then my family will see them when helping me move into my dorm, or somewhere else along the line.\n\nOn the site it says that when sending emails home, etc., that they try not to use pronouns and they use your preferred name. At any point, do they have you fill out a form or something saying something like 'Are you okay with your preferred pronouns being used in front of parents? In front of authority figures? Etc.' ?\n\nAlso, trans and otherwise queer students, have you ever had an incident were you were outed due to these sorts of things? Do you feel safe at Wooster?\n\nThanks.",

I am just an ally, so I can\u2019t speak to the experiences of LGBTQ+ students at Wooster, but I can say that I have not ever seen a student\u2019s pronouns on a door dec (the sign on the dorm room door). The RAs make these signs, and if you wanted to be certain that pronouns were not included, you could email ResLife to request that your preferred pronouns not be utilized on the door dec or during the move-in process. All RAs undergo SafeZone training, so I would hope you wouldn\u2019t have any issues with them following your lead. \n\nAnd to echo Jennywren2323\u2019s response, the Center for Diversity and Inclusion would be able to address your other concerns.",

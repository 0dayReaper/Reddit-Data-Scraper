Just like many schools who encountered school shooters, in the past decade don\u2019t let the protests influence rash judgement toward bad solutions. If nothing else invoke more oversight, and better communication so we are all safer in the long run .",

            "comment": "Abolishing police from the campus endangers more lives than they think it saves. Rather than abolishing a system that has saved many more than it has hurt, try to fix its faults by implementing more training, more therapists, more managers and role models, more tests on empathy and \"life-and-death\" mock situations. Abolish the contagious bad apples from the force using these methods than abolishing the whole barrel or tree that it came from.\n\nCampus security can only do so much. The College of Wooster already has an absurd tuition rate along with absurd sales prices in the Bookstore and C-Store (ie. Gummies prices at $32 when it was $9 at Walmart). While I have not had experience with campus security, I feel as if this will drive up their cases and hurt Wooster Students. They will have to invest in more tools, and putting even more burden on their branch will most like drive up their salaries and also what we pay to get our utilities and necessities at the college.\n\nWooster PD has much more tools in its arsenal. They point to articles where the qualified immunity did not help him keep his job at the police station. Actually, as a mixed person, I feel as if their petition is racist. They focus on the lives of black and brown people only rather than trying to fix the injustices going on everywhere. They ignore that the system also wrongs people who are light-skinned (not just white people but also Asians, latinos, or people with albinism). This is very much BLM ORGANIZATION (not movement) driven to me.\n\nIf you want to help a community out, try to focus on the pros and CONS of what you are proposing. Try to look at the WHOLE before you focus on one piece. You don't want to use the Wooster PD? Fine. Don't call them. Ask the Campus Security to only serve you and your needs, ask them not to let the PD handle YOUR case. Please do not try to force it on the rest of the populous here at Wooster.",

            "comment": "Alum here. \n\nPros:\n\n* Its humanities and social science programs offer you lots of opportunities to work one-on-one with professors. It's very much a teaching college--I'd liken it to a graduate prep school. \n* The campus is gorgeous, especially in the fall. \n* I.S. program puts you through what is essentially a master's thesis. If you don't have any rigor you'll develop it to survive. \n* Denise Monbarren runs an acclaimed Special Collections wing at the library. \n* Lots of opportunities for non-greek program house living if you don't want to live in a dorm. \n* Small campus size means it only takes 15 minutes to walk across the entire campus. \n* Admin loves to push its study abroad program. Even if you have zero intentions of using it, mention it as a draw. \n\nCons:\n\n* It's expensive, and a lot of the students don't understand that. A lot of the students were morons who thought 2-3 hours of work a night was too much. I recommend making it clear in your essay that you recognize that you are paying for the opportunities here, and that you'll make the most of anything awarded to you. \n* Elys Law is a psychopath and has no business interacting with the public. Never, ever, under ANY circumstances interact with her if you can avoid doing so. She's one of the reference librarians at Gault. Same with Jon Breitenbucher from Educational Tech (sexual predator, which is why he was fired from teaching and interacting with students). Note that this is more a personal warning rather than anything wrong with the college. Wooster does MORE to protect its students than its contemporaries like Witt.",

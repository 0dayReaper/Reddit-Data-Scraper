            "comment": "The core academic classes are not skate-by classes. Many of them are not overly difficult, but they will require active attendance, participation, and study. \n\nThat said, beyond the required First Year Study course (and even that class has many flavors), there is no single course you are \u201crequired\u201d to take. Each class gets tagged with certain attributes (Writing, Global Engagement, Religious Studies, etc) and your core requirement can be met by taking classes that fulfill a certain number of these requirements. These classes are EXTREMELY varied, and for example, you could potentially take a course that fulfills a writing course, but is offered by the Computer Science department on historical figures in computing. \n\nThe classes in your major are going to vary. I know it\u2019s probably not your intention to ask like this, but I\u2019ll say it:  Wooster is going to be difficult if you are intimidated by significant academic rigor. It is not like going to Harvard or Yale, but you still have to work at it, and your profs will straight up call you out if you are BSing them.\n\nWould highly recommend taking a look at [this page](https://www.wooster.edu/academics/requirements/arts/) .\n\nLet me know if you have more specific questions.",

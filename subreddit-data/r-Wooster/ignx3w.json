I\u2019m looking to major in Music Education and I wanted to know if anyone here knew anything about the major. I\u2019ve read the stuff on the website, but I wanted to know. What it\u2019s like, what to expect, what\u2019s auditioning like, what are courses like, etc. \nsorry for bothering with this, but I need the help!\nAnything helps.\nThank you so much in advanced.",

In my piano proficiency test (PPT), they asked me to play a major and minor scale (not C major or A minor), play a prepared song, and sightread a piece (which I easily failed because my sightreading bombs. it was an easy piece tho, so I regret it). \n\nIf you pass, usually you still have to take lessons. Lessons will have a \"jury\" (dont worry, it's with your teacher and their friend) of two people to talk about how you played the song and how you can improve for next semester. However, I believe to get any other degree specializing in Music (that isn't just the Music Major, ie. Music Therapy/Education), you must play in front of people who will judge your work. TI am preparing 3 A-level pieces (for piano). They may ask you to play scales.\n\nIf you don't pass, you will have to take two (or maybe 4) semesters of Class Piano (1 + 2). \n\nThey will from there require you to be in ensembles, take Music Theory Lessons, Conducting Classes, probably Music History classes, probably more music classes, and (most likely) Educational classes. This is where I don't know too much about because this is where our majors differ.\n\nI took Wooster Singers. There were no auditions, but for Woo-Chorus, there is. Based on the email we got this semester, I believe you prepare a vocal piece and sing to the best of your ability. Dr. Wong will place you based on your performance. Woo-Singers meets Tuesday  and Thursday and 12pm-ish, Chorus meets (almost) every day from 5-6:30pm.\n\nYou can also be in Jazz ensembles, Orchestra (marching), and Symphonic bands to fulfil that requirement. \n\nMusic Theory, I think, goes up to five or six (so six classes in the span of 3-4 years). It goes really fast, so make sure you know some theory before coming in or else you will be **overwhelmed**. Also know some solfege and don't be afraid to sing. You will be conducting and sightsinging, so yeah.\n\nMusic History is interesting but the professor is... ..... .......... not the best to say the least. So do your best.\n\nEducation classes are in Morgan and it's a considerably cooler building. I only took a class for Students with Exceptionalities due to my field, but I presume classes there are similar. **You will be an assistant of some kind at a school.** You'll be shadowing someone and/or teaching classes in your freshman year, lol.\n\nThis is most of my experience here, liking it so far but due to my field, I have to cram so much in so little time that it gets exhausting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy advice is to get materials early and start studying music theory **right now**. Make friends so you can get second opinions and help (because i'm not a people person and I regret not socializing in this field ;; im alone). Reddit has a r/musictheory subreddit and it has its discord to help as well.",

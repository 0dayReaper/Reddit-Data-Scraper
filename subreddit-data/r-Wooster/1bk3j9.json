Sure, during the school year, it's important for your sanity, but in the summer it's critical.\n\nAlso, buy all your produce from Buehler's.  Don't go to Wal-Mart for any food that doesn't come in a pre-packaged box.  So meats, veggies, fruits - Buehlers.\n\nIf you're in a dorm, make good friends with someone in a house.  Dorm life during the school year?  Pretty good!  Dorm life in the summer?  Dead.  And nothing to do.  And nobody to talk to.  People congregate in the houses.\n\nFinally, make friends with the OLO folks.  They're fun to drink with.  (Of course, you might be one of those folks.)",

Are you staying in a dorm, or in the area?\n\nIf dorms (other than Gault or Babcock), Go buy THISMUTHAFUCKA right here, it will help immensely. http://www.walmart.com/ip/Lasko-Multi-Purpose-Pivoting-Utility-Fan-U12100/19861415?_mm=\nIt may be $50, but it will do so much better than any combination of standing or box fans.\n\nThere will be a small contingent of students still around over the summer, so hopefully you can spend some time with them.\n\nOtherwise, u/emilylime92 has some good suggestions. Akron is close enough to visit regularly if you have transport. ",

    "postText": "Of course when I need Moodle for class, it decided to go down. Not my internet because I am currently streaming on Teams, which is more of a taxing operation than connecting to a website.\n\nWhere has my 60K tuition gone, hm? Definitely not into the website that has been supposed to be one of the most supportive during the pandemic. I am well aware Wooster doesn't own Moodle, but perhaps they could invest in a website or company that has much better servers than Moodle.",

Same with blackboard for my summer classes. Imo moodle is easier to navigate and the layout/interface is much better.  Last it went down for me was a couple weeks ago and it was back up in a few hours, so not a total shitshow, and the profs all acknowledged it and made the proper adjustments if necessary",

                    "comment": "You're completely right that Moodle has a smooth and easily accessible interface. My problem is their servers. If they lack the servers to even keep up the site, what's the point of a cool interface if it doesn't get seen due to poor connectivity? What's the point if the user just gives up after 30 minutes of waiting (ie. Me when I posted this thread) and uses other alternatives?\n\nPerhaps if Canvas or Blackboard took a page out of Moodle's book, they'd be better provided their servers run more stable and faster than Moodle's.\n\nMy high school was using Google Classroom. It also have a very good interface and an archiving system like Moodle.  Microsoft Teams has similar capabilities and probably more trinkets added on. They are still using an older form of Moodle, but even that seems barren on their website because they've moved to Google Classroom.\n\nIf this college is spending money on Moodle so they can host their classrooms, I am truly disappointed.\nA HS graduating class of 100, a public school who uses Google Classroom, with much less funding, etc., and a school that charges no tuition can afford and/or use better alternatives than a college that dumps its $60K tuition into (somewhat sad) lab equipment, dries up student flex/visitor's money in all their overpriced stores, yet somehow cannot find better alternatives or provide the teachers with better streaming equipment. Or better wifi, for that matter. It's all so sad.\n\nEdit: don't come to wooster if you're terribly anti social and love technology/streaming. Or if you're poor like me lol. $27 in C-store for a small freaking bag of beef jerky. (Formerly) $32 for a bag of gummies that were $9 at Walmart. Smh. Barely have functioning computers and Macs all around. No help with printers, and there are only helpers to solve /printing/ (not if the PC locks you out cus too many users, not if the PC is lame and malfunctioning), barely any IT help for hours.\nI want to know what my $60K is going to. It doesn't look like it's going into good resources.",

The emails that pile from 5PM to 9AM from students let alone events and reminders or whatever else they subscribed to might be hindering the response time to your emails. You're going to have to expect this since COW is hiring new professors (who are fresh out of grad school mind you) and a lot of them have poor time management. This is the trend I am seeing as a senior.\n\nPolitely ask remind them every two days or so for a response. \"Hello so&amp;so, I e-mailed you x days ago about y. I am wondering if you could help me find an answer to the problem I am having. Thank you.\" Or something professional.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m still considering Wooster, mostly due to the great aid package they offered me.\n\nAre graduation outcomes good? It is mentioned 90%  of students attend their too graduate school choice, but does not mention where alumni go... \n\nIs the starting salary good enough? \n\nI\u2019m probably going into the International Relations path. Any advice would be great.\n\nTo give some context: \n- I am an international student.\n- I can go to Wooster or a Dutch university for the same price (but in the Netherlands I will also have a masters in 4 years)\n- I have also been admitted to Pitt but would need to take 20k in loans (total)",

            "comment": "I mean, Wooster is great. Hard to argue with a program that will get you a masters in 4 years though. Wooster does have the ability to connect you with a lot of people and programs which can help with future employment though, so it really depends on the type of things you want to do in that field.",

The advisor you connect with may even be able to assist you in finding the school that's right for you. Definitely recommend Wooster in that case",

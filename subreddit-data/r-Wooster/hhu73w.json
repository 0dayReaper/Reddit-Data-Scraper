Like you _could_ pronounce coffee as \"coh-fay\" and you could pronounce geese \"jee-zee\" and those might be consistent with English spelling rules, but they are nonstandard and might confuse people. Since all the people who love there pronounce it \"wuss-ter\" it'll just be your own nonstandard pronunciation.",

You just have to ignore the fact it has a oo in the middle and accept that it\u2019s pronounced differently from what your English tells you. You can call it whatever you like, just know you\u2019re pronouncing it the wrong way. It would be like someone mispronouncing your name and continuing to pronounce it that way even after you correct them. It may not be as bad since it\u2019s only a town name and not a person, but it\u2019s still not the right way to pronounce it. Try not to think about it too hard and hopefully you\u2019ll get used to it.",

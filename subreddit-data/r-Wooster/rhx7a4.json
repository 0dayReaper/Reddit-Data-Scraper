    "postText": "I'm a 22 year old guy graduating from OSU and moving to Wooster to work at one of the nearby plants. I'm looking for apartments in the area (within 15 minutes of downtown Wooster) starting mid-January and most I've seen are 2-bedroom apartments so it'd be sweet to have a roommate. I'm probably looking at a total rent anywhere from $650-950/month. Is anyone here interested in that?\n\nI like music (mostly hip-hop/r&amp;b but I can get with plenty others), video games, watching shows, reading a bit, eating good food, plenty other stuff. I'm pretty social, I'm a fan of partying/going out but won't do it too much, maybe like once a week. I'll be working off shift this year at the plant, so not quite on the 9-5 schedule but I'm not loud or anything in my daily life around work. If you're interested, send me a DM!",

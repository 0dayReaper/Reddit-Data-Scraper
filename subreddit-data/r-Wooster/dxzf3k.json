I already applied and waiting for a decision \n\nSo if there's any current students or alumni that can speak on their time at Wooster that would be great. \n\nMy questions are:\n\n1). Overall how was your experience at Wooster? Were you happy here?\n\n2). Favorite/least favorite things about Wooster?\n\n3). Favorite class that you feel is a \"must take course\"?  \n4). Are the math courses taught well?\n\n5). Are the Chinese courses taught well?\n\n6). How is the location of Wooster? \n\n7). Obviously a big pull to Wooster is the I.S; how is the planning for this project conducted, how are the resources for research? If you already completed I.S has it helped with job opportunities/grad school admissions. If you are going to do I.S in the future, are you excited about it?",

            "comment": "I'm a current junior here!\n\n1). Every person's experience at Wooster will be different. I'm doing okay here I guess.\n\n2). My favorite thing about Wooster is the professors. All of the professors (at least that I've come across) are willing to help you and want you to succeed. You really won't find that at a bigger school, I would know (studied abroad at a larger University for a semester)\n\nLeast favorite thing is that there's not a ton to do in comparison to a city campus imo. I personally don't really have any friends here either. Also the food at Lowry sucks but they are renovating it so... :) (Speaking of renovations, they also just did some dorms and added a new science building, so you get some new facilities which is nice). My main issue with Wooster is the cost, it's up to you to decide if it is worth it or not.\n\n3). I don't think there are any must take classes that I know of, it depends on your major. I enjoyed my neuroscience Drugs and Behavior class. The worst class I've taken though is accounting, do not take it unless you have to.\n\n4.) Only math I've taken is a stats course and it was fine \n\n5). No clue, but generally the professors here are good\n\n6). Wooster's location isn't great, especially if you live far away and have to drive for hours back home every break (but that isn't a huge deal). The downtown area is... Okay, not horrible, same with the retail area. But it's a rural area, it won't compare to a city if that's your thing.\n\n7). IS is actually useful depending on your major, I think. Some areas will value research experience more than others, obviously. Some people do random projects they don't care about and it shows. Other people do actual lab or field experiments with respected professors in their area and it can get really interesting and serve as good experience. However, EVERY student should value it because you get to work one on one with a professor. It's basically a free letter of recommendation because you'll develop a relationship with the faculty if you do it properly. Obviously though you don't need to do an IS to get a good rec letter, but it will be easier than at a larger school like I said before. As a psychology student it will be good to put on my grad school resume too. I've made connections from this project and gotten a small internship from it. IS only gets bad if you procrastinate on it!",

            "comment": "Hi blnkspace, I'm happy to answer those questions for you. For some context, I attended Wooster about 10 years ago, so my perspective may be out of date -- hopefully another poster will provide more freshly informed answers. And full disclosure, I'm responding with a burner account, as I don't like posting personal information to my main account (like where I went to college). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#1. Overall Experience\n\nI think my experience was pretty good, with the usual ups and downs that college students face. As someone who is introverted, attending a small school was right for me (although I'll comment later why Wooster may be *too* small). It was easy to make friends and not get lost in a sea of students -- my similarly introverted friends who attended larger universities had this problem. Academically, I think Wooster satisfied my intellectual curiosity, and I think that the college's range of courses were broad enough for me (admittedly, I was a double major, so I didn't have much space for elective classes to begin with -- perhaps someone with more wiggle room would disagree). \n\nWas I happy there? For a period of time, no, but I was struggling with some mental health issues that preceded Wooster, and I think a lot of college students (Wooster and non-Wooster alike) will find themselves in an unhappy duration in which they resent their school. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#2. Favorite/Least Favorite Things\n\nI liked (and greatly benefited) from the small and intimate classes. Likewise, I enjoyed the close proximity to professors. Their availability and plentiful office hours helped with learning more difficult material and for generating IS ideas. Another favorite thing was Wooster's radio station (Woo91). Unfortunately, Wooster just sold Woo91's FM license, so now it's only an internet streaming station. That's fine, but I liked interacting with the community through listener call-in. I have a feeling that ditching the FM band has lost a lot of community-based listeners. \n\nAs for least favorite things: I disliked the small size of the student body. About halfway through, it felt like everyone knew everybody, that your business was everyone else's business, and that you lacked privacy. That really bothered me and provoked my anxiety, and I think attending a school with a student body that was 3-5k would have built up some buffers/personal space (Wooster was just over 2k when I attended). Another factor that I disliked was Wooster's rampant drinking culture. I didn't realize this until I left, but Wooster's social life largely revolves around drinking, particularly drinking to excess. As a result, I felt like the only way to socialize with people was to drink, which is physically and mentally taxing. Maybe this is due to the fact that Wooster is a rural town with not much to do. It also poorly prepares you for interacting with people in the post-college real world (people aren't always drunk). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#3. Must Take Class\n\nAnything with Chuck Kammer in the Religious Studies Department. His classes are engaging and extremely interesting. Not much to say beyond that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#4. Math Classes -- Taught Well?\n\nI think so? I only took one course in the Math Department when I attended Wooster, and the professor was competent. My friends with math and/or physics majors seemed to enjoy Wooster's math courses. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#5. Chinese Classes -- Taught Well? \n\nNot sure. I had a friend who majored in Chinese, and he liked it. His coursework seemed very one-on-one, as there were few Chinese majors and only 3-4 professors in the department. I can't provide a more informative answer than that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#6. Location of Wooster\n\nI liked it, as I enjoyed being in a smaller rural town (about 40k people). Wooster also has a lot of amenities (big box stores, chain and local restaurants, a cute downtown strip), so it doesn't feel totally isolated. It's only about 1.5 hours from Cleveland and Columbus, so it's possible to make a weekend getaway if needed (if you have access to a car). This also means it's easy to get there if you have to fly. Wooster is also a pretty inexpensive town, so it's possible to have a nice night out once or twice a semester, even on a tight college budget. \n\nIf that's too small/too rural, then you may want to consider liberal arts colleges that aren't in the midwest. Unfortunately, small and rural is the standard for colleges in this part of the country -- if anything Wooster might be in a relatively populated area for this type of college. I know Macalester is in St. Paul, and Ohio Wesleyan is in Delaware, which is part of the Columbus metro area. Aside from that, most midwest liberal arts colleges are in small rural places. Take that as you will (and I can't speak to colleges in other parts of the country). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#7. Independent Study\n\nPlanning for IS probably starts about halfway through your junior year -- some departments have junior IS projects -- although you don't have to formally plan and pitch your idea until the beginning of your senior year. Generally you meet with your advisor, hash out an idea, and then settle it by October. \n\nI think most students had adequate resources, although project ideas are constrained by what resources Wooster has. After all, it's a small college, not a research university, and your professor will likely ensure that your project is feasible given the resource and time constraints. \n\nDid IS help with grad school or jobs? No! Don't be fooled by this. Jobs are built through connections and networking -- particularly through things like summer internships. Employers won't care about your IS, and they certainly won't read it. Graduate admissions are more directly applicable, but many schools (big and small) have senior projects that are practically identical to Wooster's IS. Given the prevalence of senior theses at college's, completing IS at Wooster will not give you that much of a leg up. You'll want to get research experience outside of IS to get into a good graduate program (assuming it's research focused, like a PhD). Most classmates who attended prestigious grad programs got this non-IS research experience during and after Wooster. IS should not be a factor that sways the final decision to attend or not attend Wooster. Yes, I learned a lot from it, but it won't help you get a job. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I hope that's not too much text. Good luck with the college decision process!",

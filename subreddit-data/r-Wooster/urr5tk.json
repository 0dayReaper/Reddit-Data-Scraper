    "postText": "I\u2019m a possible attendee of Wooster, the school recently grants me a remarkable amount of scholarships. However, it seems that Wooste is not really prominent in A.I or CompSci in general. Would it hurt my chance of getting to graduate school like Carnegie Mellon later on?",

I can't personally comment on how robust it is, I never took any csci classes, but I did learn to program some basic neural networks via the math and physics departments, which both offer some courses in modeling. I know a Wooster compsci student who went on to a PhD program in 3D computer graphics, but I don't think I recall anybody who pursued grad school for AI.",

If you\u2019ve already had prior experience then it\u2019s possible you can test out of at least one semester of it and have room for a class you\u2019re actually interested in.  I think if you really have no interest in language then it\u2019ll be the easiest to take one that doesn\u2019t have a completely different script (like Russian).",

If your teacher was really bad then it might not be worth it to try to test into 102, but that\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to judge for yourself.  For reference, I took almost 3 years of Spanish in high school (though my last teacher wasn\u2019t good) and placed somewhere around the middle-range of 102 because there were several tenses we hadn\u2019t learned anything about in high school.  I didn\u2019t study at all for the placement test but even if I did I doubt I would\u2019ve placed out.",

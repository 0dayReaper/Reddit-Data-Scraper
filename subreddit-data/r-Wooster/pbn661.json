I just want to have some back up classes that will serve me well im the long run.\n\nFor example:\nEmbarassing, but I totally need a Home Ec class because I can't cook for shit. If you need a laugh today-- I once put the cardboard in with the pizza in the oven.  I burnt premade cookies. The only thing I know how to make is salty ramen out of a packet, so I think it's high time that I learn how to cook.\n\n I also think that I should be taking some business classes because because my major has to do with marketing and managing your time, efforts, and money.  I could use some statistic classes just to evaluate what's going on in the market.",

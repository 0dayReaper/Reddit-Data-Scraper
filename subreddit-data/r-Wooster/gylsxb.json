If you are like me and my friends, we\u2019d often eat out at least 1 meal on the weekend to get out and about. I only ever ate 1 meal a day at the dining hall on the weekends, and breakfast always seemed hit or miss on my schedule. \n\nI always seemed to end up with extra swipes at the end of the semester, but flex dollars are essential because you can spend them on coffee. \n\nThe dining hall isn\u2019t... gourmet. You can eat well, but you have to be a little bit creative at times. Fabulous salad and stir fry options are possible if you put some effort into it.",

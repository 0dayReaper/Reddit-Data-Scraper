This is cool because I\u2019m planning to apply phD after graduation but I don\u2019t know if there are many research chances or assistantships for my major.\nAlso, psychology major of Wooster ranks 176 by niche which is not as high as other schools I got accepted. But I still kinda like the environment here so can anyone review their learning experience and courses in psych?",

IS is definitely good research experience and if you go into school looking to get research experience and volunteering with professors, you'll have enough experience to at least get an RA position after graduating (clinical psych likes to see multiple years of post-bacc research and publications before admitting to a phd program).",

Your IS will be good enough to get you into a PhD program after school. I have a friend who majored in psych and has got a researcher position right out of Woo. I wouldn't put much stock in Niche department rankings. We're \"ranked\" 100 in philosophy but we have professors from Oxford and Pittsburgh (#1 Philosophy grad school). If you do the work, have the interest, Wooster will reward you with opportunities.",

From our point of view, if you're going to do an undergrad in a major that typically leads to grad school (like Psych), Wooster has a big advantage because there are no grad students there.  As a result, profs doing research need to lean heavily on the undergrad students creating tons of opportunity to get great research experience.  When we were grad school, the undergrads got very little research experience because the profs leaned heavily on us to do their research and their time was significantly invested in helping us progress in our own research.  Didn't leave much room for undergrads.",

I think a bigger impact will be how well you do while in undergrad (your gpa) and the research you do, combined with the GRE scores (standardized test for grad schools).  But there are tons of universities with graduate level psychology programs.  If you do the above, you'll get where you want to go.  \n\nMy wife and I both got our PhD's from Ohio University in Psych.  I have no idea where OU ranks as a grad program (she was clinical, I was I/O) but we feel we got good educations and in the 25 years since then, we've been lucky enough to have very good careers.",

Professors look favorably upon those. Wooster is weak in hard sciences but strong in social sciences and humanities. Any grad program worth its salt cares more about demonstrated ability to work 1-on-1 with a professor than the ranking of the college you come from (within reason).",

They both have a masters too, they both do not work in any psychology field because without a doctorate you simply can\u2019t work in the field. I am saying it is a bad major, just not one that is very marketable. If you are ok with owing thousands in loans, and never making very much money to pay them back. And Having to pay on those loans until you are in your fifties, choose a different major.",

What accounts for this? Is the workload too overwhelming, or students are just interested in their subject?\n\n2. How much time per day do you guys have to spent studying outside classes in order to get the homework done in time?",

            "comment": "In my personal experience, the workload was not usually overwhelming. However, it is easy to get a course load with a lot of writing, and that takes time. Basically everyone I know there studied at least a bit every day, but not at the expense of doing fun stuff. I spent a lot more time on major related/adjacent extracurriculars daily than homework. My roommate (bio/chem) probably was doing 3-4 hours of studying a day at the most extreme (JR year, around finals)",

            "comment": "Huh, I did not know that.\n\nAs a sophomore, I can\u2019t say much about the workload because it hasn\u2019t gotten bad for me yet.  But I think that it might be because of the prof\u2019s expectations.  My FYS prof had high expectations for us (fair, but high), and my assignments are usually much more involved than the lowball bread and butter of high school assignments.  It might also be because (from my experience) many students are really driven to do well and either come from schools where the expectations are higher or are the type to study a lot.\n\nWhen it comes to homework, the bulk of my time is spent on Spanish homework, but this semester was the last one where I have grammar/vocab homework so it\u2019s likely gonna be much less in the spring.  Next up would probably be my biology classes(major), though I may have been lucky in that the homework is usually just doing the readings (or a small article + questions).  I\u2019ve probably had to do less than two hours a day throughout my time here not counting finals.  It can get busier with labs, but in my experience the only thing that\u2019s gonna take a significant amount of time is the lab reports.  I\u2019ve yet to have any major group projects so I can\u2019t speak to that.",

            "comment": "I would not go off of those statistics. Everyone's experience here is different and only a few go online to write reviews about this college. Sit in for one or two classes in the middle of the school year, see how much you understand and ask the students before and after class about their workloads. EDIT: The COW now has a chat thing on their website. Chat with Alumni/Students/Faculty there about the workload.\n\nIt depends on your major and professor. It really has nothing (too much) to do with the college.  My knowledge really extends only to Music, so I'll show you a contrast:\n\nMusic Composition may be the easiest major to complete, but the amount of homework could be insane (with writing exercises) to improve your abilities and techniques.\n\nMusic Performance and Music Therapy may not have a lot of written homework, but the amount of time, energy, and stress put forth to improve your skills/culture your ability far exceeds how much you study, unless you can call that \"studying\".\n\nMusic History Classes practically had no written homework or projects. The material, however, probably should have had some worksheets because it was so memory comprehensive. The professor did not bother to write up anything, including the quizzes.\n\nMusic Theory has homework every day/week, but it is manageable and sometimes easy to complete, so the studying for this course doesn't take long.\n\nAstronomy (for math credit) had tons of homework. A discussion every week, a quiz every week, a chapter +  a section to read each week, and a homework assignment due every Sunday.\n\nSo probably: STEM majors have it the worst. Education Majors, Music Majors, and other labor intensive majors also cry but not as much, and everyone else (Bachelors in Arts or something general) probably don't have to study as much.\n\nI think it's quite like a high school experience but at least you are told everything that will be coming toward you so you can work ahead on it. There are more learning opportunities than in HS, more ways to get help, and more accessibility.",

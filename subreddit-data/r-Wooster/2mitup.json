One question though...\nI want some Wooster merch (like a t-shirt or sweatshirt) and the online campus store seems to be on the fritz. Does Wooster send a shirt after being admitted? I want some Fighting Scots gear and besides the online campus store, it seems like there's no place to get any on the internet. Thanks!",

So I wouldn't trust them to have it if you did order it online. \n\nI'd either visit (if possible) and pick something up, or write admissions asking about it, maybe dropping a hint that the website isn't working, they'd probably send you something for free. \n\nWoo crappy bookstore.",

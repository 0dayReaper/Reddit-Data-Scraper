I didn't do much work in my room senior year, in part because it was a suicide single and in part because of that wonderful carrel.  I still have super fond memories of evenings in my carrel, 5 years later.\n\nFirst floor Gault.  Against the window that looks over to Holden.  Perfect :)\n\nIf I had ever found an underclassman using my carrel, I would have been upset.\n\nNow, if there are more carrels than seniors this year and you happen to find one that doesn't have someone's name on it, go for it.",

Some will have no books/decorations piled about, those are basically free range, so go hog wild. \n\nAlso, feel free to tap a senior in their carrel on the shoulder (if they dont look to intense) and ask them if they have seen anyone using randomcarrelnearby. Odds are, if your more than about a month in to IS, you get a 'feel' for who your nearby carrel mates are, and if they ever use them. Many seniors will get an IS schedule going, and you'll see the same ones open the same times of day.",

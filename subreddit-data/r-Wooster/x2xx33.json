    "postText": "Background Information: \n- Tonight I (A Compton student) attended Compton\u2019s meeting with Dean Bobbit, Dean Reid, Campus Safety Director Joe Kirk, and Facilities Staff Tom Lockard (ONDR Nuisance Wildlife License Professional) on how to deal with bat bites and related protocols, and figured I\u2019d share some information here, given I haven\u2019t seen any official statements from the school yet \n\n- The good news: There have been no accounted bats with Rabies in Wayne County since 2013, which is actually an upside, given less than *1% of bats in the wild have rabies (Washington State Department of Health) \n- It\u2019s currently believed there\u2019s no full infestation (in Compton - given no clear evidence of roosting specifically), but that a series of bats have gotten through windows and will eventually seek direct lodgings \n\n- *Data for Ohio I could find wasn\u2019t very clear, and the Department seems to be defining more broadly\n\nWhat steps can we take?\n- If you hear or believe you even saw a bat, call campus safety first (330-287-3333) - the room will at least be sweeped if late at night, full building inspection will likely follow the next day\n- Once the initial call is finished, immediately call the The Longbrake Student Wellness Center (LSWC) (330-263-2319) - they will sort out specifics of the incident and lead you through next steps \n\n- [Bat bites generally look like small, skin level pin pricks - from what I can find they\u2019d generally bite on the neck, hand, or arm (commonly exposed areas)] \n\n- At the meeting they said they want to make clear The College of Wooster will be responsible for paying to provide all needed shots \n- They also explained that they\u2019re coordinating transportation to hospitals, but that said, the director of the wellness center has ordered vaccines to the Wooster Community Hospital (1761 Beall Ave) - so ideally the main processes will occur in Wayne County \n\n(I\u2019m glad to answer any additional questions that may\u2019ve been addressed at the meeting, otherwise please contact the people listed at the beginning of the post)",

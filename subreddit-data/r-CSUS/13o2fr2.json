    "postText": "I had my graduation ceremony yesterday and it was an amazing experience and I was glad I was able to share that with my loved ones. It was a long time coming. I was academically dismissed at one point from sac state but after taking a year off, I came back and was more determined than ever before to finish. I retook classes that I didn\u2019t pass the first time and finished all my requirements. It has been a long journey filled with obstacles but it was all worth it. To those of you who had similar obstacles and had to struggle with stress, balancing work and school and everything else, you did it. All your hard work and determination paid off, and you never gave up. Be proud of yourself for being able to walk across that stage and celebrate your hard work. \n\nStingers up!",

And with about half of the class possibly flunking that test.... Doing a take home test and reading and looking through the books is one thing, looking online for the \"exact\" same test is another.\n\nThe reason why Math professors tell you you have to be as detailed as you can be with how you got your answers is because, just because you wrote all the answers in the back of the book, doesn't mean you know how to get there in the first place.\n\nYou can rote memorize or copy from a text, but when it comes time to decide on something that may or may not readily have an answer, what then, you can't just copy someone and expect the same type of possible outcome.\n\nAND, cheating on a test.... and a ETHICS class means you know nothing about the class or that you do, and just don't care about ethics and moral code. And there is already a moral code that a student follows when it comes to studying and graduating at a reputable college. That, in itself, is why it is wrong.",

For most of human history most workers could not be educated, but it would be ignorant to call them uncritical thinkers. The critical thinkers that arose from lack of education gain that skill from expanding knowledge by themselves and outside of a \"ethics\" class.\n\nOn cheating itself, many students can learn a lot from their classes but still decide to cheat for whatever reason. Even if they cheated for a susposed wrong reason, they can still learn about ethics outside of the material they cheated on.",

A teacher teaches the basics to prepare you to set out on your own and think well on your own with guidelines that will help you prepare to think in specific ways that will help you on your journey especially in the field that you are trying to get into. Plato didn't just become a known philosopher just like that, but working under Socrates, and learning the tools that Socrates taught Plato made it that much easier for him to set out on his own and develop his own thought process.\n\nWhy would you spend years learning on the thought process when there has been developed processes that will help you to speed up and start developing your own thought process in a years time or less?\n\nWhy would you spend years developing a cure for smallpox when you can learn about the process that the developers used at the time to develop smallpox cure.\n\nAnyone can be a philosopher, they say, but it takes a whole lot more to be a decent philosopher. The thought processes that you learn from even a simple ethics course (if you even try) can capitalize your thinking in all other fields because most fields are derived from philosophy, even math, economics, government, art, you name it... they are just specialized fields that have specialized ways of thinking. You can learn to do ethics in your fields, or you can learn ethics in a specific way that makes it easier to do ethics in all fields.\n\nYou can learn to build a fire, or learn to build a fire with the proper training and that will teach you to go out on your own to properly set out and make a campfire for cooking.\n\nYou can know how to build a campfire, you can even tell the teacher that you know how to build a campfire, but if the teacher sees you building it incorrectly, that is when you know you only THINK you know how to build a campfire. That is where we are here. You can pretend that you know the material, you can pretend that you did the material, you can even pretend that you don't care about the test itself. But at the end of the day, the teacher/professor \"should\" be giving you advice about what could be better, that in turn, gives the professor better perspective on what he/she needs to do to better prepare new students.\n\nCheating on the test solves neither. It doesn't give you better perspective, it doesn't give the teacher better perspective. It doesn't tell the professor what logic or thinking a student has trouble with, nor does it allow for the professor to make corrections when teaching certain parts.\n\n\"Teach a man to fish, and you teach him for life\" is an apt saying. The 50 or so students that did the home exam, and even decided to read the books itself for the exam may have learnt to think about how to fish. The ones that looked at the fake exam answers only thought about getting a fish. You never gave a professor the opportunity to know that you are learning the material correctly, only false assumptions that you know the material.",

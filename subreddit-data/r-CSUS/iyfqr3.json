    "postText": "This is unacceptable! I am taking 6 classes.  Two of my professors gave up on real time teaching and we are just watching mediocre recordings of their lectures. Another professor, meeting is once a week and the class ends in 30 min instead of 1.5 hours. The other class is about how to find resources online to self teach. WHAT ARE WE PAYING FOR??? This is big time SCAM. I can find much better tutorials on YOUTUBE for FREE. As an out of state  student, we pay over 10-11k per semester and I can't even communicate and engage with professor and class let alone go to the campus and use facilities that WE PAY FOR. Shame on CSUS for scamming students.",

No videos, no anything. One of his last messages said he would appreciate if we could help since he needs all the help he can get. \n\nThat is what we pay for. For you to know your shit and teach it to us.",

Email cba@csus.edu with your grievances and encourage others to do the same. Yes, this professor is tenured. Yes, that means s/he is beyond redemption. But they can pressure him/her to change which might help.

She also does recorded lectures so students can listen to the class whenever the students want.  Many of her students work and appreciate that they can work hours they can get and listen to her lecture during their free time.   She also holds a lot of office hours and one-on-one meetings so that students have the opportunities to ask questions.    She also tends to break her recorded lessons into short 15-20 minutes topic so students can listen to a small part, take a break, and then listen to the other part later.  Recorded lecture can be well done, but it takes A LOT of time.  Last semester, my wife's teaching evaluations for her classes was about 4.9/5.0.",

That would cut her work in half and give students an asynchronous option. Also, If you already knew you were going to using only recorded lecture for your class, couldn't you have prepared them ahead of time during the summer when school was not in session? There are a lot of better ways to approach this. I'm glad your wife is popular but it doesn't make this approach the right one.",

Many professors don\u2019t receive their class assignments until right before the semester, and even when they do, most are not actually employed over the summer. After the switch online abruptly in the spring, many felt burned out and needed a break (like many students, I imagine!). Second, the issue with Zoom you raise is a good one. Keep in mind though that many professors balance kids, family, etc., and just can\u2019t guarantee availability live at a specific time when working in their home setting. This disproportionally affects professors who are women. Lastly, even if Zoom sessions are recorded, it\u2019s still an equity issue for students who can be there vs. those who can\u2019t (in terms of asking professors questions, etc.). There is truly no good answer, and again, I completely understand your frustration, so I\u2019m not trying to argue - just trying to show a little of the other side.",

A course i needed I couldn't take because when they added classes, it was only for night :/\n\nI will also say this, some just don't know how to use zoom or canvas, its difficult for some adjust :/ but as long as they get, I get it.",

Ask the representative how official complaints are filed at your school. Determine if complaints are addressed directly to the institution or to the Commission on Colleges overseeing your school. Write down the answer. Take the representative's name and date the document. Save this document as proof of the response you received from the office in the event you need it in the future.\nCompose a written letter. State exactly the details of the alleged complaint; be as specific and honest as possible. Identify any evidence and/or additional witnesses you have to support the legitimacy of your claim. Note your relationship to the institution -- a current or former student, for example -- and demand that the complaint be handled without delay. Prepare for the letter to reach the desk of the president of the college or Commission on Colleges -- so make your letter count.\nFill out any official forms necessary to file a complaint. Complete, for example, the Complaint Against Institutions: Information Sheet and Form associated with the Commission on Colleges Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Ensure you complete all necessary forms and submit your written statement in conjunction with those documents. Mail all letters and forms as hard copies. Failure to complete hard copies of required forms and/or submitting electronically may result in disregard of the complaint.",

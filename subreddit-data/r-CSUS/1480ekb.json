    "postText": "The fact that sac state takes so long to provide degree verification or to post our conferral date on our unofficial transcripts for spring 23 grads is so frustrating. I was offered a job at the state weeks ago and am just sitting waiting for sac state. I wish they could do something for those waiting for verification other than tell us 4-8 weeks, request transcript and hold for degree.  \n\nI just needed to vent because I\u2019m so frustrated lol. They need a better process!!",

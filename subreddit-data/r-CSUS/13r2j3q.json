    "postText": "Recently, just added a new class an hour ago. I went to accept my subsidized/unsubsidized loans, the dollar amount was there. I actually declined the subsidized loans because I only needed the subsidized loan, but the system wouldn't let me unless I accepted both unsubsidized and subsidized loans, which I did. After accepting, the dollar amount goes to $0 and the system says that I've declined both loans. I will contact the bursars office tomorrow but not sure if this was a system mistake or my mistake. Anyone else have this issue?",

The subsidized loan doesn't have any interest when you're in school, so take as much of that one as you can then take a lower amount of the unsubsidized if you need it.",

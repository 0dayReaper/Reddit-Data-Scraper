Pretty sure I've left my car on campus for well over 24hours and been fine. \n\nIf they notice your car for some bad reason that catches their eye, they might bother caring but I don't think they expend the energy to track who is in what spot. Dorms have visitors. Students stay to all sorts of weird hours. With the switch to plate recognition instead of permits it might make it easier for them to track location of they really wanted to.",

Before Grinder and other modern dating apps, it was a lot more difficult for the LGBT community to find partners. Hence glory holes and other cruising spots being a lot more prolific than in our current society. \n\nApparently, from what I've been told by some alumni, is that the bathroom stalls on campus used to be made from wood. People would drill holes in the walls of the stall to make glory holes. They tried installing metal plates over the holes, but people would just drill a new one. So they were replaced with plastic/metal walls to prevent this from happening. Mendocino bathrooms are a lot more secluded and lesser used for a variety of reasons, and was likely one of the better spots for that kind of activity. \n\nBut people are creatures of habit, and this is likely all stemmed from that. If I were to make an assumption based on what I've heard. \n\nTake all of this with a grain of salt, because it could just be the alumni I've talked to making things up or misremembering what happened when they attended.",

They aren\u2019t well over the line. Their front tire is on the line. As are both your front and back tires. \nNeither one of you are parked very well in the first place and it would be hypocritical for either of you to complain about the other\u2019s parking. \n\nThis is a very small problem. A very minor inconvenience. Life is full of much worse problems. Get over it and move on. \nYou can\u2019t control what other people do, only yourself.  If you had centered your car better, you wouldn\u2019t have had to enter through the passenger side. \nSince that\u2019s the part of this scenario that you can control, I\u2019d suggest you use that knowledge in the future. \nMaybe try to not get so frazzled over life\u2019s tiny problems, that you think it warrants a whole Reddit post. Learn to let go of minor frustrations. No real harm was caused to any person or property here. Life is so much easier and more pleasant when you don\u2019t actively look for reasons to feel slighted.\nEveryone makes mistakes and has momentary lapses in judgment. We\u2019re all human. We\u2019re all fumbling through life the best way we know how. \n\nAt the end of the day, if you still have all your appendages, your health, your basic needs are met and you haven\u2019t alleviated anyone else of their appendages, it was a good day. Be thankful for that and forget about the car that parked too close to you. It doesn\u2019t matter that much. Breathe and relax.",

There seems to be this steadily increasing tendency for people to take unreasonable offense to the smallest things. It feels like the pandemic accelerated this and I don\u2019t know why.!Maybe it\u2019s something to do with being on lockdown for an extended period of time and it\u2019s made people forget how to exist as part of a polite society. Maybe it just made everyone completely self absorbed and unable or unwilling to consider that not every perceived offense was intentionally directed at them. I\u2019m just guessing as to the cause, but everyone is unnecessarily offended all the time. \nIt\u2019s causing a lot of chaos in the world. People attacking flight attendants like every week, that guy in Texas murdering neighbors for a frivolous reason. Too many other stories to list, but all of them over tiny things. We\u2019re losing our humanity and it\u2019s scary. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you would actually do it, but if I heard a story on the news about someone at CSUS beating someone to death for parking too close to them, I don\u2019t even know If I\u2019d be surprised by it. Given some of the things that have happened over the last few years, it sounds like an entirely plausible scenario. \n\nIf it happened prior to the pandemic, Id have been blown away. If it happened today, not so much. \nEveryone is overreacting to everything. \n\nIn reality, they probably were just in a hurry to get to class and were careless in how they parked. That would be my assumption. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but it sounds like you assumed they deliberately chose that space and parked that close to you on purpose. Maybe they did, maybe they didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know for certain and neither do you. Why is the default assumption that it was deliberate? Why not give them the benefit of the doubt? Do you know how full the garage was when they parked there? Even if it was as empty as it appears in the photo, what\u2019s the proximity to the elevator or stairs? Maybe they were just trying to get as near to those as they could because they were running late? What\u2019s the reason you chose to park there? That\u2019s probably the same reason they chose to also. \nAnyway, just food for thought. Take it or leave it.",

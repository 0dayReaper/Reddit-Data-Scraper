Wifi is another $20 I believe) starting on August 22nd.\nSame date as the move in. It's a 4\u00d72, fully furnished apartment. Parking is also available as part of the lease. Washer and dryer unit is also available inside the unit.\n\nHERE IS A LINK TO A VIRTUAL TOUR FROM THEIR TIKTOK:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTREqwkDn/\n\nYou would have your own single room but share a bathroom with 1 other housemate. In total you would possibly have 3 other housemates. It is off campus student housing but they will also make exceptions for non-students! * LET ME KNOW, I will work with you anyway possible!! Any gender is welcome to sign as well \ud83d\ude42",

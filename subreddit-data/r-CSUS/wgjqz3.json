Hostile is a term that refers that refers to having malicious intent. How is it that Sac State is malicious to those who don't fit the typical student mold? Perhaps college is meant to mold you into something. \n\nAnd by saying I'm part of this malicious problem is another ridiculous thing. Kudos to anyone working, raising a family, and studying, but it is there choice to take on the burden, a correct choice. One must accept the challenge, not claim there is hostility from the college because it's too hard.",

            "comment": "1. Not teaching students how to think critically\n\nSacramento State University (SSU) is not only failing to teach its students how to think critically, but it is also failing to prepare them for their future careers as well. All they do at SSU is teach kids about what they know instead of teaching them how to learn and explore different ideas. Students never get taught how to analyze information, research, or collaborate. So, many times they just take what they\u2019re told without questioning whether it\u2019s true, or if someone else has already proven it. When they graduate, they don\u2019t know anything except what they were taught at school, which isn\u2019t nearly enough to compete in today\u2019s world. There is no way to get a job without being able to figure out who is right or wrong, and then proving yourself to be correct. However, when you go to Sacramento State, you are taught how to believe whatever you want to believe regardless of facts. That is how dumbed down our education system has become.\n\n2. No real classes or professors\n\nThe courses offered at Sacramento State University are not worth taking. There are no classes that actually deal with anything useful. Instead, people get assigned projects that have nothing to do with their field. In fact, many of these assignments require you to buy expensive materials and even pay someone to help you complete the assignment. There are no professors at Sacramento State University. Most of the teachers are adjunct professors who are paid extremely little and work under horrible conditions. You may ask \u201cWhy should anyone care about the welfare of the students?\u201d Because Sacramento State University is supposed to educate us. If we didn\u2019t need to learn something in college, why would we bother going to class?\n\n3. The food is disgusting\n\nWhen you look around campus, you often see students eating unhealthy foods like pizza and burritos. The food is gross, overpriced, and sometimes doesn\u2019t even taste good. I don\u2019t understand why Sacramento State University thinks it\u2019s okay to charge $10+ dollars for food that doesn\u2019t taste great. Also, some of the food is prepared by low-quality individuals who may use chemicals in order to make it taste fresh.\n\n4. Sac State University makes students feel worthless\n\nAt Sacramento State University, the instructors treat the students like idiots. The instructors tell the students what they are allowed to say and how they are allowed to express themselves. At least once a week, the instructors yell at the students for making mistakes or speaking loud enough for others to hear. These instructors also belittle the students and make them feel stupid. They show up late or miss class entirely. Sac State University tries to force students to be perfect and obedient. It teaches students that they lack value and importance, so the instructors try to change that mindset.\n\n5. The dorms suck\n\nThere aren't any dorms on campus. There are small rooms where you can live with two other students. But the problem is, those are like closets",

Here is 7 reasons Sac State won't help you get a job  \n1. Because they don't want to  \nSacramento State University (SSU) is a public university located in Sacramento, California. Founded in 1849, SSU is the oldest state-supported institution of higher education in the West. In addition to its undergraduate programs, SSU offers graduate degrees in business administration, criminal justice, education, engineering, nursing, psychology, social work, and sociology.  \n2. Because they're not allowed to  \nThe California Department of Education prohibits any school from offering employment assistance to students. According to the department's website, \"the purpose of the prohibition is to prevent schools from using their positions as counselors or recruiters.\"  \n3. Because they're not qualified to do so  \nAccording to the California Department of Education, only licensed vocational rehabilitation counselors may provide job counseling services. Vocational rehabilitation counselors are trained to assist individuals who have experienced a disability, illness, injury, or unemployment.  \n4. Because they're afraid of getting sued  \nIn 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states cannot force private employers to hire people with disabilities. The ruling was based on the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires employers to make reasonable accommodations for disabled employees.  \n5. Because they just don't care  \nDespite the fact that many universities offer career counseling services, some schools still refuse to help students find jobs. According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, approximately half of colleges and universities nationwide do not offer student employment services.  \n6. Because they think it's beneath them  \nMany schools believe that providing career counseling services is a low priority. According to the National Career Development Association, only about 10 percent of high schools and less than 5 percent of community colleges offer career counseling services.  \n7. Because they're lazy  \nSome schools simply don't offer career counseling services because they don't want to spend time doing so. According to the National Center for Educational Statistics, only about 20 percent of high schools and 6 percent of community colleges offer counseling services.",

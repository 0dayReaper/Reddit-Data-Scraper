PS5 also has a digital sign that will read how many student spots are approximately available.\n\n - PS3, check the under-ramps. On the base level, there are several ramps that go down and connect to the other lower ramps. Often you'll find spots here as people don't check them as often.\n\n - Faculty/staff spots can be parked in by students after 4:30 p.m. I believe? Might be 5.\n\n - It's better to park farther quickly and walk then drive around frustrated for 30 mins.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m currently a chemical engineering major but switching into econ for personal reasons. I have essentially no units done for Econ but I\u2019m aware of the pre requisites needed in order to transfer from Davis to Sac. \n\nMy question is - do you think it\u2019s a good idea? My biggest reason for switching is that I can\u2019t do the quarter system. Not to trauma dump but I have both schizophrenia and bipolar and I can\u2019t handle the rigor of a quarter system anymore. I also do like the prospect of my gpa starting over after it was crushed by an engineering major I couldn\u2019t handle. The only downside I can think of is that I\u2019m worried a lot of my units won\u2019t transfer over. \n\nI\u2019d love any advice I can get.",

            "comment": "Hi.  I don't know if my situation is exactly relevant to yours but I left UCDavis a long time ago because of the quarter system also.   I think it's an excellent idea to transfer.  Good for you to prioritize your health.  I went to American River College after some time away to work on my lower division classes and transferred to Sac State once my lower division units were completed.   Now I have one more class this fall before I graduate.  Most of your classes will transfer over. You can double check using [https://assist.org/](https://assist.org/) to check exactly which classes will transfer over.  The quarter system units will be less than semester units but if you ask, they will match it for you so that you won't need to take anymore classes than necessary to graduate.  Good luck! You got this!",

I\u2019m close to graduating but 1 thing lingering over me is that I need 0.33 units in 2 areas (1 general ed and 1 major specific) due to the units transferring as less. Any tips on who to talk to to see if they can be rounded up more or less?",

I emailed a degree advisor this past March  and explained my situation. She \"lowered\" the required units to match my UC units and everything is kosher when you check out your degree requirements in the student center portal.  Her email is wendy.jenkins@csus.edu Good luck and congrats!",

            "comment": "I dropped out of Davis and took some time off. Went back to CC to complete a public speaking class as an admission requirement and then transferred to Sac State pretty hassle free. Nearly everything transferred. \n\nI think it could be a good move for you. Most of us are thrilled to get into Davis and don\u2019t really give a second thought about whether it\u2019s actually gonna be a good fit. Sac State is a completely different vibe and a good chance to start over if you\u2019re sure that Davis isn\u2019t gonna work for you. \n\nI will say that \u201cstarting over\u201d is more mental than anything. If you think you fucked up your life by posting a poor GPA then 1) Sac State transcripts do show your transfer GPA of each school and calculate it in your overall GPA (which is different from Davis iirc) and 2) nobody will ever look at your transcript anyways unless you\u2019re applying for grad school, so try not to get too down on yourself. Good luck!",

But I don't see why you can't transfer from UCDavis to Sac State provided you meet the requirements when you apply.  It was easy transferring from ARC to Sac State.   That's kinda the whole point of community colleges.  There are programs agreed between the two to facilitate that.  Basically, satisfy the requirements for your general ed classes with a 2.0 GPA.  There's also an AA degree for transfer that guarantees you a spot at Sac State.   Best advice is to set up a meeting with a counselor from ARC and let them know what you want.  Or a counselor with Sac State if you want to skip the community college route.\n\nhttps://arc.losrios.edu/student-resources/counseling\n\n[https://arc.losrios.edu/why-arc/graduation-and-transfer/transfer-to-a-four-year-college/transfer-to-california-state-university](https://arc.losrios.edu/why-arc/graduation-and-transfer/transfer-to-a-four-year-college/transfer-to-california-state-university)\n\nEDIT: Best of all, community college is free for all California residents!",

Most of your credits won\u2019t transfer and you can lose significant progress. They decrease the units you earn no matter what, that alone sucked so much. They divide units earned by 1.5 to equal the semester system. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to transfer to a school that has semester system if you\u2019re already past 60 units.",

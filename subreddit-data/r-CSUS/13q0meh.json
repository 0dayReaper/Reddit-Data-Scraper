I don't intend to show any disrespect toward the professor, but I am not going to spend my time so inefficiently on something that I already know.\n\nYou should be graded based on what you know, not your ability to physically be in a class. Yes, people who attend class more tend to succeed more *on average* but it doesn't show what you know at all. \n\nSure, in a perfect world, we could reward those based on effort, but grades are supposed to reflect your knowledge, not the effort put in. If one student shows up every day but doesn't grasp the material, and one student never shows up but knows the content, the latter should pass.",

I have some bad memories of driving 2 hours in traffic to a GE class for credit and learning literally nothing. I can't imagine having kids or bills to pay and just sitting in a room doing nothing because you have to.\n\nI know this and I can prove that I know this, just give me the test.",

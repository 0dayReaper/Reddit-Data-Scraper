            "comment": "I remember in May, the military used to have an exercise where a flock of attack helicopters would rendezvous at the Guy West Bridge.  It's an easy landmark to find, and the river is easy to follow for helicopters.\n\nMy class was in the building just behind - Computer Science at the time, in a room that faced the street and the bridge.\n\nFor about five solid minutes no voices could be heard over the sound of all those apaches.  It was really grand. The professor just stopped talking - there was no use trying to compete.\n\nAs it happens I was in another similarly situated classroom when they did it again the next year.  Unfortunately I wasn't always there when they ran that exercise.",

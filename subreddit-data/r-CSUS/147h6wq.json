They have this thing called \u201cremote computer lab\u201d where you can use a school computer from home on your computer, but you gotta download a lot of stuff for that.  HOWEVER if you just wanna draw for yourself, I recommend using Procreate on iPad.  I use it and it\u2019s fun; one time purchase.  When I bought it I think it was like $12?",

You might want to create emails on different computers, such as campus computers, because they can catch on and detect suspicious accounts. And if you already have multiple emails then those should work fine. I did this for the majority of last semester.",

You can still active it even after you graduated CC so long as you have access to your old student email.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotably you mentioned below that you want to use the iPad version, CSUS does not have access to those versions (as far as I know). The CCF does though.",

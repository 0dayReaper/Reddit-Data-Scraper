But if you're taking 1 class in first session and 1 in second session, you'll have to wait until the second one starts.\n\nIdk why it's like this. I find it to be discriminatory. Those who can't float that payment can't take summer classes, thus falling farther behind in registration status and can't get classes as easily in other semesters. It's a nasty feedback loop that only affects low income students. End rant.",

I can't afford to make minimum wage during business hours. They offer no alternative. They don't want someone who isn't already in the club to succeed.",

The whole premise of getting educated for me (I've been impoverished my whole life, 1st gen) is obtaining upward mobility and securing a better financial future... but how do they expect us to achieve that when it's systemically rigged against poor people?",

I actually played the game and made myself available during business hours by saving up money and then none of the few internship sites available in the Spring hired me. I've wasted three years and $30K of my own money on this.\n\nBtw, I'm a middle aged woman who is grossly overqualified for a 16/hr internship, yet here, I'm an undesirable candidate. It's pretty wild, and insulting.",

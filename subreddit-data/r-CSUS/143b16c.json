Note that priority is not the same thing as title 1 and the list is an excel file on the GSTG site. After 8 years you have to prove you met the terms or pay the 20k back in full. \n\nWhat wasn't advertised to my cohort is that it counts against your total financial aid. For us it was advertised as a get started in your career, make up for all the unpaid labor you are completing, relocation, extra on top of financial aid. Myself and peers that took out loans lost their pell grants and vice versa because the GSTG put them over their limits.",

If you completed 2 years, you'll only have to pay back 50%, 3 years 25%, etc. They will also give you a four year payment plan for whatever you owe, it does not need to be paid in a lump sum payment.",

I was privileged enough to not need that loan, but my friends in the program were not as lucky.\n\nThe way I see it though, it is a 20k loan at 0% interest for 8 years. That is not bad at all considering you are eligible for PSLF at 10 years for your normal loans. I have a job lined up already and if Biden's debt relief goes through, I can pay everything off in 3 years max.",

If someone has both, that's an extra 4 years of payments on the federal loans before they qualify for PSLF. \n\nDepending on their loans/payment amounts, that could mean they end up paying **more** on the loans than their GSTG is worth.\n\nedit: Again, this info should be confirmed, I am not 100% sure.",

That way if you change your career path or decide to work at a non-priority school, you can still get forgiveness as long as you continue to work in government, education, or ANY 501c3 non profit, of which there are many. Something to think long and hard about. PSLF means you'll need to make payments for 10 years, so take that into consideration too. The new IDR plan caps payments at 5% of your disposable income each month.",

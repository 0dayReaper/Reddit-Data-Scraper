He was a controversial curmudgeon who hid in a mansion near the school, I never interacted with him.  \n\nIs Nelson going full cringe and trying so hard that it comes off as tone-deaf? Yes. Indifference is way, way worse though. The emails show that he or at least people on his team are thinking about us, and I have to hand it to him - email is the most effective way to get in touch with me.",

I want to be able to pick and choose who sends me emails so that what I get is relevant.  There is also the issue that anything from companies that I WANT a job from tends to get filtered out by the school which is even more agravating.",

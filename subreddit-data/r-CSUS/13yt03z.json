    "postText": "I was not able to meet SAP so now I have to write an appeal to the financial aid office. Can anyone give me any feedback on it or criticism. Thanks ! &lt;3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\[The following is what happened:\\]**\n\nDear Financial Aid Office,\n\nI hope this finds you well. Unfortunately, my academic performance was significantly impacted due to unforeseen circumstances that arose within my family during the Fall 2022 semester. My entire family, (excluding myself), contracted COVID-19. The health implications were particularly severe for my mom, who has a chronic illness, and my brother, who has respiratory issues. As a result, my dad, who is the sole income provider, had to take three weeks off from work to care for himself and my entire family.\n\nThe financial strain caused by my dad's absence from work intensified my anxiety and made it challenging for me to focus and upkeep my grades. I was constantly worried about my family making ends meet. Consequently, my grades suffered as I struggled to balance caring for my loved ones and keeping up with my coursework.\u00a0\n\nMy academic performance decline created a snowball effect on my overall well-being. Not only did I have the responsibility of catching up on coursework. but the additional stress took a toll on my mental health. I was planning on using the on-campus counseling service to try to seek help but unwisely used that time trying to catch up on my assignments. Very soon I found myself fighting an uphill battle. In my efforts to try and catch up I was studying material from weeks before while having up and coming exams that focused on current material. Not seeking help for my underlying mental issues was what made things worse.\n\n**\\[The following is the steps I will follow to succeed:\\]**\n\nThank you for understanding the challenges I faced during the Fall 2022 semester. I want to assure you that I am taking proactive steps to make up my credits at my local community college this summer after a lengthy discussion with my academic advisor.\u00a0\n\nI aim to focus intensively on my coursework and catch up on the material I was unable to cover during the previous semester. I have created a detailed study plan that includes allocating specific time slots for each subject and setting goals for myself. This way, I can stay on track and effectively manage my time to ensure that similar circumstances do not hinder my academic progress in the future.\n\nIn order to prevent a similar situation from occurring again, I have learned the importance of seeking help and support when needed. When I return to UC Merced, I plan on utilizing campus therapy resources to address any underlying mental health concerns. I understand that my well-being directly correlates with my academic performance, and I am committed to maintaining rigorous study habits as well as balancing my mental health with the help of counseling services.\n\nBy implementing these measures, I am confident that I will be able to enhance my academic performance, avoid any future setbacks, and make the most of the resources available to me at UC Merced.\u00a0\n\nThank you so much for understanding. I am determined to overcome these challenges and achieve my educational goals at UC Merced.",

The more proof you have the better. But why does it say UC Merced?",

I posted it here bc uc merced\u2019s subreddit is small. Yeah the hard part will be having documntaion since we were in quarantine and did not go a doctor.",

I've written a few SAP appeals like this too, you should be fine especially if you have a medical or a bank statement or two to back it up. If you don't, they should understand too but maybe just be prepared if they ask for any documentation. Really old medical documentation works if it backs up your statement. Good luck!",

Nothing that gives too much away because of HIPPA, but something that says \u201cthey\u2019re being seen by me for xyz\u201d or just that you have a condition and you\u2019re being seen by someone so that it shows that you\u2019re working on fixing it. Since you said that you want to utilize the resources at school you can show that you have an appointment scheduled like a screen shot of your appointment.",

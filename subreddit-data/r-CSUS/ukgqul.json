It was honestly pretty insulting and I was just trying to mind my business doing homework between classes, not trying to be judged because I\u2019m not religious and don\u2019t share his values. He made a point to tell me how people used to be stoned for my sins. He was wearing a Sac State shirt and when I asked he said he was a recently retired professor. I wish the school wouldn\u2019t let the come to campus, some of them are polite but others are very invasive",

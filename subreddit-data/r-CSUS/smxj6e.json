I\u2019m not trying to sound overboard, but rules are rules and I don\u2019t want to get sick. Tyvm.",

If we weren\u2019t still in the middle of a pandemic I would be super excited to get back in the classroom. But since we\u2019re not we have to deal with this.

Students who are at-risk or who have family who are at risk can avoid the areas that don\u2019t require masks, or at least stay distant from unmasked people. That\u2019s not even to mention professors, who absolutely have rights too.\n\nLectures are frequently mandatory, and once class has started, it can be hard to find a new seat.

I'm confused who you mean.  \n\nEvery person on earth could use more education, but those confused about basic health and safety could use a bit more.   \n\nIf you're asking my opinion, considering that some students live with elderly grandparents or children too young for the vaccine, and considering that many required courses are now in-person only without virtual flexibility, and that our regional hospitals have had 0 ICU beds since the second week of January, I'd recommend staying strong on mask policy, at least until those hospitalization rates drop down to more reasonable levels. My sister works in ICU and it's near- impossible to provide proper ICU-level care when patients are extended to other wings and floors of the hospital. We could also be doing more non-mask mitigation techniques to keep airflow moving better indoors on-campus with fans and forced air, but I haven't seen any ideas like that in 2 years.  \n\nI'm sorry to hear you got sick, that is crummy. I hope you feel better, and just FYI I know a fair amount of people at this point who've had it twice. So there's no reason to lay your mask down too early, unless you enjoyed getting sick.",

To students or to those who wish to make money off of said students? As I mentioned above, his responsibilities are largely completed by his support staff. As for \"pressure\", yes, I will concede that. Teachers tend to get either tenure or unconditional contracts after a time so the job stability is good. But does that make him &gt; 6.5 x more valuable than a full time faculty member (not including his housing allowance and car allowance, etc?) Would the college cease to function if he (and only him; not his support staff) were gone?",

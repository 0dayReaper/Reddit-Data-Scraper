I emailed the center and they showed me there was seating but they didn't tell me if there was an ADA dropoff. \n\n Wondering if there's a safe place to put my gym bag at G1.I changed my mind about people and how they're inherently good inside. Someone stole my hydro flask in Douglas Hall and I'm still bitter about it because I didn't put it behind the podium.",

The response I got was that every time they were told about the policy they toned it down so free speech must be upheld although they don\u2019t condone this behavior. Also was offered a meeting to discuss it further. It\u2019s all bs, I think hiding behind \u201cfree speech\u201d is cowardly. How are students supposed to feel safe when they can get yelled at and name-called by protestors on campus just for existing? Despicable. Debating my next move, I usually don\u2019t get involved with this stuff but this whole thing really struck a nerve\nImo president Nelson/his office/advisors/whatever really screwed up in their response. They made it sound like the students were in the wrong for reacting to it. Put the whole story out or don\u2019t address it at all. Wondering who to contact about this.

This was shortly after the 2016 election. My paper discussed the notable symptoms of someone who has undergone indoctrination or reeducation. Remarkably, it aligned almost entirely with the personal reflections discussed in the presentations of other students. The following week I was pulled from class and had to have a sit down with an Administrator, who first told me I couldn't have an attorney present, and then told me I was creating a threatening environment and my case would need to be reviewed if I wanted to stay enrolled.\n\nMake no mistake. College isn't about learning different perspectives anymore. That's just some shit they put on the brochures for parents.",

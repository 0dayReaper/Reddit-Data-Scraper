They tend to be self-directed and require less assistance from me and other classmates than my students who do well in class but not online.\n\nMy experience is that doing well on campus tends to not always translate well to doing well online but good online students seem to always do well in person also.

I think it's a combination of the two years of online learning, easiness of Sociology, and Sac State's population in general. Not to say people are lesser than others, but Sac State hasn't challenged these students or made sure they were ready for higher academia. It really make me feel alienated a bit, but maybe I'm full of myself or in the wrong major.",

Since this was a very large portion of our grade and I was determined to get an A, I ended up rewriting all of their work two days before it was due. I still think about how exhausted and flustered I was with this assignment. \n\nWhen we got the graded papers back, my professor said it was the best paper she had ever read teaching that class. The only corrections we received were minor grammar mistakes. It wasn\u2019t even a very well-written paper IMO. Still one of my proudest (but also most infuriating) moments in college.

I don't see any police on campus trying to find the bathroom guy and all we get is an email and tips for women on how to be \"safe\", yet these men get away with doing this nasty sh\\*\\* and nothing happens. This is unacceptable and if this were any other issue, Sac State would be doing more to stop it.",

Borderline civil/privacy rights violations they can cross real quick, making sure bathrooms are \u201csecured\u201d at all times. I really think they need to have more security actually walking the buildings and halls, I have yet to see a single one. They drive around all day, give tickets in the parking structures ALL day, but don\u2019t actually walk around????",

I was so livid, I ended up leaving for the day and sent them a huge email and included the president and everyone else I could. I was pisssssed. Like they include well charges in our tuition but can\u2019t include the parking pass? Instead ticket us $40. Most of us don\u2019t use the well. Same could be said about parking so what\u2019s the argument? \n\nAnyways, I\u2019m salty about the CSUS parking lmao I\u2019m so over it. Security/TAPS and sac state police all SUCK",

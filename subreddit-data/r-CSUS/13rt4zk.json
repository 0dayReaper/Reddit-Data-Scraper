            "comment": "It usually happens when your advisor submits the paper work to have one class count for a requirement in your catalog. I'd be willing to guess you're on the older catalog that doesn't include a class that the new one does and you took or will be taking the new catalog class so the paper signifies to admissions office that this class counts for said requirement. If you are still worried then I would just reach out to your advisor and ask them about it.",

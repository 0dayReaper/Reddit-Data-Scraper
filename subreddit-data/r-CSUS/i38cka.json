Are any fellow students interested in creating an opposition to these fees? With the financial burden that we all currently face given the pandemic, I find it unfair to be charged for services we won't be able to use. If you are interested in the topic let's discuss options.\n\nEdit: does anyone have any ideas as to how we could possibly organize? Does anyone have a platform on which we could share our concerns with one another and take our concerns to the faculty?",

What has he done that indicates he is abusing his power and not caring for the people of the school? If something is happening in this regard I believe we should all be informed on the subject matter.",

And things like this has happened before at least twice since the time I've been here with the paradise fires and such but nothing on this scale and people were asking for some kind of compensation back then since the school closed those times too and he didn't help so this has been an issue in the past too.",

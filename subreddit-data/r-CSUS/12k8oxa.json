    "postText": "So I was chilling on campus and then realized I forgot to bring my packed lunch with me. Didn't wanna pay for the campus food and then luckily I saw somebody eating a sandwich and a lightbulb went off in my head. I thought about it for like 5 mins and walked over to ask if i could have a bite of the food. I guess they thought I was robbing them because for some reason they ended up giving me the whole thing but i'm not complaining. Looked at them right in the eyes as I devoured the sandwich and went on with my day. Saw a bag of cheese itz on the table too but the sandwich did the job for me. Confused, baffled, but definitely not hungry.",

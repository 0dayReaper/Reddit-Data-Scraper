    "postText": "I am currently looking to take my writing intensive this summer. I originally planned on taking either MUSC 129 or HIST 140. HIST 140 requires you to watch two movies per week before Wednesday and have a 1000-1500 word essay done by Friday. So I am currently rethinking that choice and might just take MUSC 129 instead. Please give me some feedback and let me know what you think is the best choice",

If i remember correctly it was a 600 word paper every week and she would assign a song to listen to or live music and you write about what you hear. Its all opinion based and refreshing. Even the final paper was more on opinion with some research. I ended with an A as long as you turn everything in on time.",

Because u/MichaelmouseStar edited the comment, most of this doesn\u2019t apply. However there\u2019s still no source for the claims about child sex trafficking and QAnon in the comment. \n\nI don\u2019t support this guy at all. I don\u2019t condemn his actions though. I will fight for his freedom of speech even if I think he\u2019s a grifter because everyone deserves the ability to speak their mind no matter what comes out (as long as it\u2019s actively not causing harm which this guy most definitely isn\u2019t)\n\nOriginal comment:\n\nSorry that source says nothing about online child sex trafficking. \n\nHe has two court cases in Alaska, [one is a restraining order because of stalking 12 years ago](https://records.courts.alaska.gov/eaccess/searchresults.page?x=5VhWFbTsna4vpzQAGt42WWHAbgsEjhQ2qAa2JdQ2irDs9YDVP5NUkh8tBNXJK7WgK0YP9Gf3y1wokpvFa8zYVA) and [the other is for disturbing the peace with loud noises](https://records.courts.alaska.gov/eaccess/searchresults.page?x=5VhWFbTsna4vpzQAGt42WWHAbgsEjhQ2qAa2JdQ2irDs9YDVP5NUkgEXfXlByUQPKOJwWtApXl2if2tFE7fz-w) which was dismissed. Ultimately he was not \"convicted\" and especially not violent. You can search [here.](https://records.courts.alaska.gov/eaccess/search.page.3?x=zblJEtGIHOXBW2PBGyJ8mA)\n\nYou can also search Oregons [here](https://webportal.courts.oregon.gov/portal/Home/WorkspaceMode?p=0) but there is hardly anything notable.' He was accused of \"offensive physical contact\" in 1999 but it was dismissed. (Which means it may not have happened, innocent until proven guilty, just because we don't like him we can't assume). He was convicted of stalking when he was arrested in Alaska and extradited to Oregon, sentenced to 60 months of probation. CR1110317 | State of Oregon VS. DANIEL JOHN LEE but that is hardly a violent crime and online sex trafficking. \n\nThe other most interesting things other than a bunch of parking permits and lane change violations is his divorce and restraining order 18DR16818 | Lisa Mae Lee vs Daniel John Lee on  3/27/19. And he owes child support to someone else so Idrk what thats about... 21DR18009 | State of Oregon vs Carl B Bolon and Daniel John Lee. Annnndddd he owes child support to someone else too... DR09010673 | ANNIKA LEE XREL VS. DANIEL JOHN LEE\n\nAll of this is to say (well I was quite bored) that this guy, despite being crazy, isn't doing anything wrong and is not a convicted violent criminal. \n\nThe best thing we can do if we don't like him is ignore him. I'm not suggesting he is trying to elicit a reaction, but by getting angry and getting mad you are letting him \"win\". He does not care, but he has every right to be there and say whatever he wants, and he should. That is what the first amendment protects and we should not start policing speech we don't like because that is how we become fascist.",

What do you think the intentions are of stalkers, exactly? Most judges will not issue a restraining order without the threat of violence from stalkers. Even though he was caught and made to stop before doing something more technically violent, he has very likely done lasting psychological damage to another person. \n\nWith the rates of random sexual assaults on campus this past semester (far more than I recall happening ever in undergrad), what\u2019s happening at Davis, and how aggressive these protestors have become (compared to past experience with them), I think it\u2019s safe to say people should know about this behavior point blank so they can make decisions about how to avoid him.",

And I think it's a bit ironic to say this is how we're becoming fascist, especially considering the kind of world he wants and students have just as much of a right to counter-protest.\n\nI wanted to point out that his criminal history should be noted since we're on a school campus with youth. The violent threats he's made against his wide which he was arrested for are incredibly disturbing. Furthermore, he resisted arrested, requiring multiple officers to take him down.\n\nAnd I wouldn't be that light on stalking, especially if he was actually convicted for it. Someone willing to start that far will almost always go further. The point is that he's willing to get physical, and I'm aware his entire point is to rile students up. But students should still be informed, whether informally by other students or formally by administration, of such a deranged individual on campus.\n\nHe sometimes takes money from people who believe that he's a prophet. He has ties with QAnon, and he's not like a registered sex offender. But his Patreon was supposedly deleted for his dangerous criminal background and promotion of other child sex trafficking scammers.\n\nEssentially, he's a grifter with a serious criminal history. \n\nWhile I agree with you that he shouldn't be given more attention, I think it's important to understand that it's not as easy to ignore for some students when their identity is being specifically targeted during a time when the whole world may also be antagonistic about their groups.",

(Fortunately you can\u2019t stalk more than once before you get jailed)\n\nWe become fascist by witch-hunting people and policing their speech because we don\u2019t like them. It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of world he wants. We can\u2019t control him. \n\nI do agree that the students there have every right to be there. \n\nThe violent threats he made against his wife I couldn\u2019t find anywhere online. If you can find them I may change my mind but I don\u2019t think people should be judged by their 12 year old tweets. We don\u2019t need some kinda social credit score where anyone who ever did something wrong it follows them around. He did the time in probation already. \n\nAs for resisting arrest, I HEAVILY disagree with the United Sates view on resisting arrest and escape from prison. In other countries it is considered a natural act and not punished. Of course you\u2019re going to resist if some officers barge into your house and try to put you in handcuffs. \n\nSo what? Someone who committed a non violent crime against someone he knew 12 years ago should have that follow him for the rest of his life? Nothing about his stalking charges are physical (other than resisting arrest but that is resisting being physically pinned down which I think of course everyone\u2019s gonna do). We can assume he \u201cwas gonna do something\u201d but he didn\u2019t and it\u2019s unfair to pin that. \n\nI also think it\u2019s important that he knew the person he was stalking. He wasn\u2019t just stalking random college students (like that other old white guy we got an email about). \n\nI already responded to the QAnon claims in another comment. They are blatantly wrong. It\u2019s a different company called Q Ideas. Completely different. There is no proof he believes he is a prophet. Yes he takes money from people but his website is set up like you\u2019re donating to his church not that he\u2019s a prophet. \n\nHis patreon was shut down because it got witch hunted and reported. I think the child sex claims are blatantly wrong too. \n\nLike I said before, I don\u2019t like this guy and I think he\u2019s a lunatic. However, I don\u2019t have any issues with what he\u2019s doing or with what the students \u201ccounter protesting\u201d are doing. \n\nThe only thing I have issue with is people trying to get him kicked off campus because of a made up \u201cviolent\u201d criminal history, ties to QAnon, and child sex trafficking.",

If ANY of the claims made here (*violent* criminal, sex offender, potentially even QAnon) were true I would advocate to get him off our campus. \n\nTo respond to the QAnon and sex offender comments (because I didn\u2019t notice there were multiple slides), that tweet got it all wrong. \n\n[Here is the QAnon tweet](https://twitter.com/ALT_uscis/status/1222061525948604418). If you listen to the video, he says \u201cQ Conference\u201d and shows a crowd of elderly people. This is not in fact a QAnon conference. \n\nThis is [Q Ideas](https://qideas.org/about/) (Yes an absolutely terrible name\u2026 Q stands for questions). \n\nFrom their website: ```Q Ideas is a proven vehicle for building and sustaining a vision for restoring the credibility of the Christian faith in Western culture for new generations.```\n\nHardly alt right conspiracy group that QAnon is. \n\nHere\u2019s more proof: https://books.google.com/books/about/Good_Faith.html?id=2yzinAAACAAJ&amp;source=kp_author_description You can also google \u201cWhat is a Q Conference Gary Lyons\u201d\n\nAdditionally, those elderly people are not QAnon and they have no idea what 4chan is. It makes 1000x more sense this guy is part of a crazy Christian\u2019s group than a 4Chan group. \n\n[Here is the Supreme Court tweet with no support for him being QAnon](https://twitter.com/travis_view/status/1162080017041412097)\n\nEdit: I finally found more about the sex trafficking claims? I guess? Idrk but according to these tweets he seems pretty against it. https://web.archive.org/web/20191002203705/https://twitter.com/dnajlion7 \n\nHe\u2019s also against Edward Snowden one of the biggest heroes of QAnon further showing he is not QAnon. \n\nHere\u2019s more: https://web.archive.org/web/20191001215352/https://twitter.com/StormIsUponUs/status/1179150240630198272\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure that last slide means he labels himself as \u201cexposing child abuse\u201d which isn\u2019t true but he also isn\u2019t *involved* in the child abuse.",

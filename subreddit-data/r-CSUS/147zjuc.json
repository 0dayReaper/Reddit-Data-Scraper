I'm not enrolled and won't be, so it doesn't matter, but I was a little shocked to see that during a year I earned $12K I didn't get any grant money, yet during a year I earned $60K they rolled out all the free money.",

For tuition purposes, 6.1 units or more is full time for costs. But for financial aid purposes it's 7 or more units for full time status. Idk why it's like that. Basically you need to take at least 7 units to maximize your financial aid/minimize costs. \n\nAnd what the previous commenter said only applies to undergrads in summer, not you.",

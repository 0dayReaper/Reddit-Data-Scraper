Once I started using it I get to live like a normal person.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t tried it I would absolutely give it a shot. It takes a few days to kick in, two doses per day the first week then one dose a day after that. By far the best product I\u2019ve used. It\u2019s like 20 dollars a season for me and I get almost no symptoms even in a pollen windstorm\n\n* I don\u2019t work for big Flonase",

    "postText": "feeling a bit scared and nervous as I was apart of the most recent graduating class, but when final grades were posted i noticed today that my professor input the wrong grade for me. this discrepancy causes issues for my graduation status. I have my first real job lined up, and my start date is dependent on receiving my diploma. I emailed the professor &amp; also registrars office, haven\u2019t heard back yet. Do I have any other options?\n\nEdit: thank you everyone for all of the great advice! My professor emailed me back &amp; resolved the issue with the registrars office. Now I won\u2019t be a fraud, LOL.",

If the Professor is unresponsive go to the Department Chair. If your department chair can\u2019t fix the issue then you would need to file a grade appeal. During this process I would give the Registrars office a call and see if they can make any notes that you\u2019re seeking a grade revaluation.\n\n[CSUS Grade Appeals](https://www.csus.edu/academic-affairs/internal/grade-appeals.html)",

If you have any evidence of your correct grade, I would save a record of it (For example, does Canvas show you a certain grade (then screenshot/download it)? And is that Canvas grade the \"correct\" grade according to whatever weighting system they might use?). Professors are people too and make mistakes.  \n\nIf they don't get back in a couple days and it sounds like its urgent, then contact the Chair of the dept. I normally would say give the Prof a week to respond to make it right first (and/or explain), but this sounds time sensitive. You might even have better luck if you went to the Dept office in person.",

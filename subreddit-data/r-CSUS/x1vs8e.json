When I hit the \u201cemergency\u201d button, the driver sent back the \u201cbusy\u201d signal. Perpetrator got off (no pun intended) at the 65th st exit. The only saving grace was that there were cameras, and that guy was on parole for a similar offense and his parole officer recognized him from the video. The incident happened at the beginning of a school year; I got the subpoena for his court date a week or two before finals. I failed all my classes that semester because of the PTSD nightmares and crippling anxiety. \n\nAnd I hate the argument that more people on public transit = less sexual assault. Some perpetrators rely on the crowd to hide in or to have an excuse to rub up on (and probably grope) a woman as they pass by.",

But in this case, most of them were elderly or much smaller than the perpetrator, and they were all looking at phones or books with headphones on. So everyone was oblivious and I didn\u2019t try to get any of their attention because they didn\u2019t look like they were prepared to deal with a violent, large, white male.\n\nThe do-nothing that really pissed me off was a guy in a corner store. There was a man (who apparently was an employee of the store) who consistently made gross comments about my body when I came in. One day I told the owner and he sheepishly said, \u201coh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d And did nothing. The third guy present was like \u201cit\u2019s a compliment,\u201d to which I replied that it\u2019s not a compliment to me, it\u2019s gross and it needs to stop. Dude that made the comments escalated and started marching and stomping toward me. I ended up pushing him into a rack and he fell on his back with a bunch of hostess cupcakes and such all over him. The third guy present repeated through the ENTIRE altercation, \u201che\u2019s a nice guy! He works here, he\u2019s a nice guy!\u201d It\u2019s pretty easy to forgive the oblivious people on the train when a bystander literally defends a man who is literally attacking women in front of him lol",

For that same reason, a motorcyclist generally maintains a higher level of awareness because they know and expect that stupid driver to not check their right so they watch how the driver is acting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I'm not saying that motorcycles are the only alternative.  They are simply **an** alternative, and probably not a great one either.  What I am saying is that more students need to seriously consider what sort of options can be used for their location and circumstances and opt for whichever option can be made to work best for them.  Students living in the apartments or houses near campus could opt to walk or ride bikes to campus.  Yes the bus system has the stigma of seemingly being hostile, but hostile encounters on bus's are quite uncommon and will can result in the harasser getting ejected from the bus by the bus driver if the bus driver is notified.  Additionally, bus riders don't need to ride alone all of the time, they could form a community with their fellow bus riders which builds the safety in numbers benefit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow yes, I do acknowledge that none of these things fully address the issues that we have on campus, and if enough complaints are made to the campus administration and potentially made to local media in order to make the necessary waves to get the school and city to take action, action will be taken because both have a reputation that they are trying to portray.  This may especially be the case for Sac State because the university administration has been touting their whole campaign of becoming an \"anchor university\" that \"contributes to the local community\"",

This goes beyond students obviously.\n\nFor long distance commuters, I have more empathy. In all honesty, I believe people are far too attached to comfort. Astronomical gas prices, inflated car prices, and insane insurance cost are not enough to incentivise finding alternative methods of commuting. It's easier to follow the path of least resistence and complain when you experience the tradgey of the commons.\n\nStay safe out there if you are cycling to school. The same people complaining about RT and homeless making them uncomfortable are problably doing so while driving.",

Add more bikers to the system to the point where university administration notices and they'll have to act or they lose face.

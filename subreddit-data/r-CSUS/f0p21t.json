    "postText": "Today around 4pm I left work, walked by Riverfront, and under the wooden arc thing I had noticed a small pile of flowers that some (4-6) people were surrounding. Upon closer observation they were praying and honoring the life of a deceased Squirrel which layed there on the concrete. \n\nWell that was the most Sac State thing I have witnessed this week, how is everyone doing?",

He left behind his girlfriend who also attended Sac State and parents.\n\nHe suffered a seizure while walking to class last semester. He died at that spot. Fellow students attempted CPR. Medics worked on him for about 20 minutes. They wheeled him off in the ambulance. There were more flowers and candles there at one point, but they're long gone.\n\n[https://statehornet.com/2019/09/sac-states-student-death-seizure/](https://statehornet.com/2019/09/sac-states-student-death-seizure/)\n\nUpon second thought, there very might have been a dead squirrel students were mourning. But the area is very close to where a student died...",

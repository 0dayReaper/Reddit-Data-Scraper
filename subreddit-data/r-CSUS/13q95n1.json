    "postText": "Hello, I'm looking to transfer to Sac State, and I'm a little confused on when I'm supposed to apply. I believe I don't have enough credits to consider my sophomore year of college \"completed,\" so I think I'm in the same boat as incoming freshmen. Around what time would I be able to apply for the Spring semester of 2024? Or should I just wait and apply for Fall 2024? Is there any application processes that I can do now while I wait? Thank you to anyone who reads this post!!",

    "postText": "Hello Hornets! I am a newly admitted student for fall 2023 and I am interested in hearing about the Business Programs from here. I am looking to probably study accounting. I am a Hornet legacy (my mom graduated from here) so Sac State is really special to me. Sac State is close to home and I know a lot of people that goes here.\n\nI have also been admitted to UCLA for Business Economics major and USC (which stands for University of Southern California) for Business Admin Major. These schools are really far away from home (I live near Sacramento) so I didn\u2019t know too much about these schools. How does Sac State compared to UCLA and USC in terms of the business majors? Sac state and UCLA cost similarly to me btw.",

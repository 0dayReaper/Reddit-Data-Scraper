Mines states that I can\u2019t register until I\u2019ve received a score but they were released on Monday. I\u2019ve already emailed the GWAR department but I just thought I\u2019d throw it on here. Thanks!",

My friend who tabled at orientation yesterday actually asked the WPJ table on my behalf what was going on and apparently the scores are still being uploaded onto the student center and to keep checking. Apparently they should be on by the end of this week; super frustrating but we just sadly have to wait.",

You can also call Undergrad studies if, for any reason, your score doesn\u2019t pop up soon and/or you don\u2019t get an email back, and they can try and look into it. You\u2019re welcome!",

You would have to find someone on the roommate finder if you want to find someone you are comfortable living with. I couldn\u2019t find anyone and ended up living off campus. Honestly can\u2019t say Sac State is very trans friendly from personal experience. Feel free to PM me if you want to discuss further.",

The roommate sorting, unfortunately, probably will put you w/ someone of your AGAB, but at least its someone who showed interest in the gender inclusive option. If you need more info send a dm:)",

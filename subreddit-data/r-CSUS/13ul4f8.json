Your first time you shouldn\u2019t have to pay. I think you get 2 or 3 free ones I could be extremely wrong on that one but for sure your first time you don\u2019t pay. You can send it directly to a place if that\u2019s what you want and I think you can also send it to yourself. I believe it takes 3 days but I don\u2019t fully remember",

I choose whether I want it to be sent directly to the place/institution I want it to be delivered or if I want it for myself. Make sure for the Official Transcripts do not open the mail if you are giving it to someone as official documents.\n\nFor online, when I was a student, I think the first few were free (I can't recall.) And you just go through the student center and request to have the Official Transcript delivered somewhere.\n\n[Current as well as Alumni + Former Students](https://www.csus.edu/student-life/records-transcripts/transcripts/)\n\n**Official transcripts may be ordered through the following methods:**\n\n    Online (for an additional fee)\n    Paper Form paid for at the Bursar\u2019s Office\n    Paper Form Submitted by Mail\n\n\n **Current Students**\n\n    Log into your My Sac State account.\n    Go to your Student Center.\n    Select Order Transcripts Online.\n\n**Alumni or Former Students**\n\n    Order Transcripts Online\n    Transcript Order By Mail",

    "postText": "Hello everyone, Im currently attending SCC I plan on transferring to CSUS. I saw on the school website that the deadline for registering for Fall 2023 was January 15th. So I visited the admissions office today and was told about the appeal that I can file for considering my application.\n\nDoes anyone have similar experience with registering late? And what are the chances the appeal is approved?",

Which I heard they always do, extend the application date. The only down side to it mainly for all new students is that you don\u2019t get your expected classes most of the time because they are always full or you get sucky professors but that\u2019s about the only downside to it. As years go by, you\u2019ll be able to get priority and they give you earlier dates to enroll classes so my best advice is get your Upper Division classes out the way and if you can\u2019t, try to get your major classes out the way. Good luck!",

This prompted the assailant to accuse the conservative duo of \u201charassment\u201d before lashing out physically.\u201d\n\nSo again, sounds like they got what they were looking for. Intentionally confronting someone you had beef with online face-to-face is generally done for a few specific reasons. If they weren\u2019t trying to get into a fight, they were definitely trying to get under his skin and cause a problem.",

You put those words in my mouth for me. My point is that TPUSA were clearly pushing and prodding at this guy in the hopes of getting an off-the-wall response to send to Charlie Kirk and company to make themselves look like victims and make \u201cleftists\u201d look crazy, and then they whined and cried when they got exactly what they were hoping for. Short/white mid clearly has some issues and needs to chill the fuck out, but there really are no good guys in this story at all \u2014 I have no sympathy for people who go looking for a fight and then get one. \n\nAlso, this is beside the point, but honestly, there are times where violence is an acceptable response to words imo. Not words like \u201clibtard\u201d or \u201calt-right\u201d obviously, but if someone get their ass kicked on campus for calling someone a \u201cn*gger\u201d or \u201cf*ggot,\u201d I would frankly have no problem with it whatsoever.",

They believe everything tips in the direction of minorities already, and that the socioeconomic discrepancies exist *despite* a system that favors them. You don't have to do hard math to figure out why they believe that. You'll find Democrats who take that position if you search hard enough, but they are few and generally much older.\n\nI'm also not clear on what both political ideologies mean.

As the president of the conservative club that he was a part of, do you really not think he strategized ahead of time?   You're replying to me as if I'm the one who started swinging, when all I said was they should both be punished because they both contributed.",

But, you also shouldnt antagonize someone you know to be unstable, that's just asking for trouble.  This guy is known to be unstable, and the two have clashed before and had previously had a heated discussion in a class.  The camera man followed him out and started antagonizing him.  He should have just let him keep walking.  The reaction was 120% uncalled for, you should never hit anyone and I am not condoning violence.  I'm just saying he was literally asking for this to happen, he should have just let him walk.  He is still partially responsible for the incident.",

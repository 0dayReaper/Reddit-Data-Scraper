I understand if you are a freshman coming in, but seriously checkout some of these resources.  \n\n\n[https://roommatefinder.webhost.csus.edu/](https://roommatefinder.webhost.csus.edu/) \\- Official Roommate Search for Sacramento State\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/groups/604390969696646/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/604390969696646/) \\- Facebook group\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are a student, working part time (20 hours) at $18 an hour is $1440 monthly gross yet some people here are posting their leases for like  $1100, heres some advice, never pay more than $800 for a room, if its shared, you better be paying like 450 MAX,  these student complexes are exploiting you.",

Half my income monthly went to rent. I lived off campus commuting 40min roughly every day because of the area. Some students don\u2019t have a car to commute or made way less than I did. I think it\u2019s hard when you can\u2019t even save up money for a car when you have to take care of bills like rent and food or cc. Commuting was the only way I saved money until gas went up and I had to move there!! Nothing is affordable in the Sac region for a single person, and if it is, it\u2019s not a safe area in my opinion. Not to mention how awful living situations with strangers can be!",

I\u2019m sure there is a small subset of students that have that kind of income, but it\u2019s rare enough that I personally didn\u2019t run into any during my 2 years.\n\nThe only people who do that are either already working in a professional field and have a significant income (uncommon but it happens), or have parents providing them with help in the form of cash allowance, a vehicle, a place to live while school isn\u2019t in session, or something else.\n\nI don\u2019t doubt that you and your friends worked, me and my friends all did as well. But those of us that were truly 100% independent (like myself) had the sense to live somewhere that cost half as much, and where we didn\u2019t have to share a room with anyone.\n\nJust trying to clarify that I didn\u2019t choose not to associate with those people, but that I didn\u2019t associate with them because students who haven\u2019t gotten any assistance from parents and choose to live in the dorms are virtually nonexistent.",

I\u2019m told by complaining guys that the mens\u2019 rooms are often quite filthy.  \n\nThere are always a few guys who completely filthify it for everyone, and all the other guys pretty much know who the filthifiers are.  For \u201creasons\u201d nobody ever confronts.\n\nAlthough I\u2019m sure it must happen, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a totally filthy ladies\u2019 room at any office I\u2019ve ever worked at.  But one occasion when the mens\u2019 room door has been propped open, I\u2019ve seen a bit of what the guys are complaining about.\n\nI\u2019ve even had guys point out a filthifier, whispering, \u201cSee that guy?  NEVER shake his hand.\u201d\n\nSo what I\u2019m saying is that this shit will never end.  There will always be people whose mothers didn\u2019t raise them right, were never properly trained, or they\u2019re just plain sociopathic and don\u2019t care that others must use those restrooms after them, and then someone must also clean them.",

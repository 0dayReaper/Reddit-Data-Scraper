There's also a few lease take overs that pop up on this thread over the summer and I would look on sites like [roommates.com](https://roommates.com) to see if anyone is renting out a room near campus. If you end up living a bit further away and dont have a car, Sac offers commuter sleeves for your one card that allows you to get free bus rides.",

However, a little insight as a current resident, most residents stay for the next academic semester/year and get priority. That fact alone is often enough to make spaces very limited. Even applying ASAP doesn't guarentee a spot (though it absolutely helps, as that is how I got in myself). I wish you the best in possible getting in and finding housing. Take care.",

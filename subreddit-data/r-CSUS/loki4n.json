    "postText": "\n\nHere is the school newspaper State Hornet [article](https://statehornet.com/2021/02/sac-state-vision-center-closure-optometry-services/)  about the Optometry closure. What is not mentioned in this article is that I had been on maternity leave and medical leave related to the pregnancy...of course there would be less students seen because I was the only optometrist. But the student demand never stopped. I had always been fully booked for the semester with a cancellation wait list. And then the administration blocked the ability for staff to make appointments for the students. \ud83e\udd7a.  They never let me come back to my job or to the eye clinic from maternity leave.\n\nIt\u2019s crazy that in 2020/2021 we as female professionals are still fighting against what feels like maternity leave discrimination.  \n\n[please sign the petition to bring it back](https://change.org/csusSaveOptometry)",

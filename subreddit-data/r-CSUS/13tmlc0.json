    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nI\u2019m an incoming transfer to Sac State after completing my first year of college and I was looking at housing options. I was thinking of one of the two options in Hornet Commons and wanted to know if it would be a good idea. \n\nFor some context, I live about 45 minutes away from campus and I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be okay with commuting that long (I\u2019ve only began driving the past couple months). Although, if worst comes to worst, I\u2019ll take the commute. \n\nSome questions I have are is there choice in your roommates? Will all four spaces in the Commons be filled up? Is there any way to connect with other transfer students? \n\nHas anyone lived in Hornet Commons? If so, how was your experience? \n\nI had a rough last semester or two in terms of roommates, dorm life, and so forth. I was hoping to gain some insight and clarification and to know if it\u2019d still be worth it to room in Hornet Commons as a Transfer.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",

Some of them help each other out even and also send alerts about suspicious activity (which there is a lot of, sadly). Be careful with your car if you have one (lots of break-ins). My friends stay there and it's good overall though, much better than other options.",

I didn\u2019t meet them till the day I moved in tho. If you want a better chance to like pick your roommates, I would suggest looking for people selling their lease! In most situations, all rooms are filled I think! It\u2019s a good option but it is quite expensive so just be aware, but for having all new appliances and across the street from campus, it\u2019s not bad!",

The staff every time I\u2019ve seen them are very unhelpful even over the phone they sound annoyed. I was stuck outside my apartment at midnight and I called the RA on duty and they were so mad at the fact that I left my keys in my room and were like well next time we right you up and I was like are you actually kidding me. I hated it there including my roommates that was the worst part not being able to choose your roommates. Mine were dirty, messy, and just so unkind. I promise even though HC is close to school I would just make the commute which is what I\u2019m doing for my last semester. If you really don\u2019t want to, then, I have heard great things about The Lark and The Wexler.",

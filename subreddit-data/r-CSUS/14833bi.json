I wanted to know the pros and cons for living in Hornet Commons vs dorms.\n\nAlso, is there a specific price for each dorm because people have been saying that Riverview is the most expensive. Although, I've never seen a specific price for each dorm. Only an overall price.",

Living in dorms sounds like a terrible experience, you\u2019re better off renting a room elsewhere. \n\nCSUS is known to be a commuter school, so I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll really be getting that college experience here. Most people I know just attend class and then leave right after.",

Based on stories from friends, the dorms are not it, if you are able to get a spot at Hornet Commons you should definitely consider staying there. If you are considering staying throughout the summer near campus, I would suggest getting a year long lease at HC instead of the 9-month academic lease as it\u2019ll be less monthly if you sign for the year long lease.",

It's honestly so ridiculous. My 1 bed 1 bath apartment off-campus is $1030 and I get the whole place to myself. Do not rent from anything school affiliated if you're able to find a room somewhere else. They're taking advantage of students and it's disgusting that this is allowed. \n*Edit: my total comes out to ~1200 with bills which is better than having a shared apartment for the same price*",

I would say HC is better for *most* people, as HC has...\n\n- Way nicer inside, has modern stuff (granite countertops, floor isn't carpet, nicer furniture, stainless steel fridge) vs AMC's old stuff\n\n- You get your own sink. AMC has you share 1 sink with another person or 2 sinks with 4 other people.\n\n- Way more room than the freshmen dorms. You actually have a living room; freshmen dorms have a tiny hallway.\n\n- Less supervision\n\n- No required meal plan, you can also buy the tiniest one that AMC residents can't buy (3 weekly meals)\n\n- Electric stove. AMC has none in unit, only a shared one in the first floor community room next to a fridge. I think this applies to the freshmen dorms too.\n\n- Washer/Dryer in unit. AMC has a shared 1st floor washer/dryer, IDK about dorms.\n\n- A pool. \n\nAMC &amp; Freshmen dorms:\n\n- Less expensive\n\n- Right next to the Dining Commons and a little closer of a walk to campus (~10 mins)\n\n- Easier to find parking and it's literally a few feet away from the building \n\n- More forced interaction with others since you all share one building (can be good or bad).\n\nI'm moving from HC back to AMC because I can't cook and my girlfriend lives there, but most people would like HC more. Good luck OP!",

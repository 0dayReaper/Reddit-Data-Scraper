There are no repercussions for this, all the WPJ does is make a suggestion based on the work you submitted, but you don't have to follow their suggestion. I scored high on the WPJ, but they still recommended I take extra English courses but I didn't because I didn't feel that it was necessary.",

Whatever you turn in (given it's your work) will still be your work that they grade you on.",

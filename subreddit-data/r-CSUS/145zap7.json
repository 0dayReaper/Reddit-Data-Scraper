Does that mean I won\u2019t receive any aid for the year? Or does everyone\u2019s say that? This is my first year at sac state, but at my previous school I received aid every year because my EFC is 0.",

Also look into grants made specifically for teachers. There are a few, but the only ones that I know of are the golden state teacher grant, and teach grant (they come with a catch!)",

If you don't it's not covered for any aid, 5th year/credential program is considered the same as previous years so aid should be the same or similar. That's what I was told at lease.",

My recommendation would be to make sure that this school is listed on your FAFSA application, then check with the fin aid office to ensure your documents are in order. \n\nAwards like Cal Grant / GSTG will be awarded in July or August, but sometimes schools provide students with estimates beforehand.",

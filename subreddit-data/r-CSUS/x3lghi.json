    "postText": "My airpods have been tracked to be in California State University for the past two days. Someone stole them from me in Seattle, but I locked them + put them in lost mode. It was in a dark blue silicone case, but it has probably been taken off. I've called the CSU Library already as well as the police. If the person who has them can see this, the airpods are connected to a phone number and to my phone. I can track you continuously as long as you have them.",

I feel like sometimes people forget that students are also adults. So it makes it even worse when they lie to our face and raise the costs due to 'essentials' when the presidents and the people who probably dont set a foot in the classrooms they \"manage\" get paid more than the professors that actually care. There is this thing called administrative bloat that I researched during one of my classes here and It had to do with the influx of money from loans feeding the rise of bullshit jobs that actually seldom benefit the student body. \n\nI bet some people can make the claim that they do actually work, but to make the case that they work to the point of making over half a million dollars is just not acceptable. If you get into the education sector it should not be for money, it should be for caring about teaching and raising the next generation. These positions need to be cleaned out. \n\nlook into the irish bank strikes of the 1970's and I would imagine that if we eliminated half of these administrative positions and flushed more money to the professors we would get better quality education.",

You don\u2019t need higher education to make a lot of money. This post is stating things everyone here should have already known tbh. It\u2019s no secret these institutions are just money makers. If it took this post for ppl on here to realize then it\u2019s just sad and they REALLY aren\u2019t getting their money\u2019s worth. It was obvious right away how bad these people nickel and dime you for a subpar education. \n\nLol like you thought someone was gonna be there to make sure you study and finish your shit in college? This post made you realize other wise? \n\nI bet I make more money than the professor who wrote this but with a fraction of the schooling \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f but it\u2019s chill! That dude prob loves teaching for some reason and wanted to do it since he was a kid! If you are trying to land a dream job (that many people eventually realize is a nightmare)then a degree is relevant. But if you just want to make money? It\u2019s not a requirement. I wasted a lot of time and money on my degree that I don\u2019t even neeed. It\u2019s fine I don\u2019t regret it. Valuable experience. Way too expensive for way little value. But it\u2019s fine. Sorry i didn\u2019t want to be in the kayak club or some shit to make my money stretch or whatever this teacher is saying \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\n\nI would NEVER advise someone to go to state college let alone sac state. Depends are your goals and what you want for a job. \n\nEDIT: after reading my comment back, ive realized I\u2019ve outgrown/ too old for this sub now \u270c\ufe0f\n\nEdit: lol everyone\u2019s salty, y\u2019all want to downvote but won\u2019t say anything\ud83d\ude02 take control like your supposed to with our state education lol",

This professor has good intention but is broadcasting the wrong thing and it gets posted here \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \nIt\u2019s not his fault, it\u2019s what he thinks is right. I did the exact thing in the post and while it worked, it cost way too much money for the education and the resources mentioned. There are great programs at every school but overall my siblings and I were able to find careers without our degrees and I often wonder if I distributed my time/money to other avenues of life I\u2019d be further along. I don\u2019t regret my education necessarily(great friends, relationships, sports) but I couldn\u2019t recommend it based on the institution, Proffesor, or the quality of education. One day, you\u2019ll hopefully have a very good job and you\u2019ll find out that some people in a lot of industry\u2019s don\u2019t have formal educations\ud83e\udd2d. For private businesses no one \u2018has\u2019 to have a degree (regardless of what the job posting says lol) if you own a business you can hire whoever you want! It\u2019s a free country! And ppl do it eveyday and I see it more and more all the time. Yeah a degree helps your chances in saturated markets but yeah just join pb&amp;j club and go to office hours to make a living sounds good lol",

I get where you're coming from, and I think a lot of the problem is largely societal / capitalistic greed  at the core. But I'm firm in my stance on the value of education. \n\nThe post above describes it well, and that you really need to utilize college as a resource rather than just getting good grades. It's what you make of it. That being said, there are alternative pathways that one can pursue and be successful like you mentioned. I just wish that public college tuition was built into our tax system instead of students having to take out loans.",

My brother has a degree in archeology and works thru finance. If you network well and the right ways you don\u2019t need the degree. If you can network REALLY well you don\u2019t even need the college.

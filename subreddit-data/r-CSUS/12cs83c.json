    "postText": "Hi Guys,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a CSUS alumni- Stingers UP!- and I have a BIG story for the school newspaper.  Odds are, some of you have had your bike stolen, chopped, and resold.  Well, The Biggest chop shop operation is literally on the street where I live, and Sacramento cops wont do anything about it.  Here are some details:\n\nAn unattached trailer appeared on my street 4 weeks ago, since then I would be willing to estimate over 1000 bikes have come through it.  Multiple people drop off bikes every single day, Im talking 20-100 bikes a day.  The guy who lives there takes them apart, puts them back together with different parts so they cant be identified, and then loads them into a white pickup truck who then hauls them away and sells them elsewhere.  I have told this to 311, city countil, and the cops and nobody is doing anything.  I want to bring as much attention to this as possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone from the school newspaper sees this and wants to write a story on it, please DM me.",

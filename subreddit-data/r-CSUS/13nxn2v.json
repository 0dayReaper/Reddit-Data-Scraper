    "postText": "One of my professors had not graded our final projects or several of the discussion questions from the class, but the canvas course for that class is gone as of yesterday. Is this normal? I'm a little concerned that I'm not going to be able to see her grade for the project I worked my ass off on, and I'm not sure how to see my final grade if the course isn't there.",

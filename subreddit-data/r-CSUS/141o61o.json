    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI noticed that Sac State can be a bit unbalanced in terms of helping students get jobs and internships/job experience depending on their major. For my major in particular, I noticed that it gets more help from our department for students to get internships, but when I talked to other students in different majors, they said their department doesn't really give them a lot of resources for internships. If you are either a student or alumni, what are your suggestions as to how Sac State could help students more?",

It's entirely pointless and blocks community engagement.\n\nInternships have to be \"approved\" and in the graduate program I just had to abandon, they were all during business hours.  There are zero opportunities for remote internships or those done on evenings/weekends because the university is always 10 -15 years behind the times. That's discriminatory against older and disabled students, or anyone else who has to work during the day to make a living.\n\nMy department, Public History, openly blocked me from an online internship two years ago and I had to quit my program because there aren't any approved opportunities that allow me to work.  I'm older, disabled, and don't have the income of others to fall back on.  They send us job listings for internships but nothing else. Since its a graduation requirement, I find the lack of help appalling.  It's a nice way to keep people like me out of the profession.",

The department is made up of the types of professors who all went to school on the expected timeline, so they seem to have zero awareness of older students who have to keep a job that pays a living wage and health insurance. I was nearly done when I quit.  \n\nFWIW, I actually left a job and made myself available during business hours so I could complete this graduation requirement and then I couldn't get hired for any of the approved internships I applied for. Twenty six years of work experience.  Not good enough, apparently.  Now I can't get a job in my old career.  So I came to Sac State and left with no MA and a lot fewer opportunities than before I came here. A complete and utter waste of time and money.",

They aren't there to \"help.\"  When I was chosen for that remote internship in 2021, I wrote the advisor about it because I knew it wasn't an \"approved site.\" She couldn't be bothered to respond to me directly, but instead sent out a mass email about a number of topics, and buried in it was that she could not approve any new sites. Thanks for your help! \n\nBeyond making sure a remote internship meets the pedagogical requirements, why does it need a site agreement?  There's no liability. \n\nSo no, I have not engaged with them about this. I'm also a middle aged white lady and me saying the word \"discrimination\" isn't likely to go over very well. \n\nDEI is lip service.  Any \"DEI\" program that never talks about older students or the disabled isn't a DEI program at all.",

Luckily my advisor gave me some top secret advice that you can do a summer internship and waive the requirement but the way the requirement is shown online and in the catalog it really wants you to complete it DURING school. To help other PUBH majors they should just offer 195 (internship course) during the winter and summer and they really need to expand the internship partner list or make it easier for companies to join because its already hard af to get an internship imagine trying to find one that specifically in the fall and is a campus partner, its almost impossible",

It could potentially bring more money to CSUS and really make CSUS more competitive than, say every other city in Northern California (being too hopeful here, lol)",

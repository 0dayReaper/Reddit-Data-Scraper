Thankfully all my finals were either papers or exams taken at home but it sucked needing to blow my nose every minute. Was also a hard time for my ex as it was her graduation semester and she was crying at the fact that she might not graduate because she wasn't able to take the in-person finals. Thankfully, the professors came to their senses and let her take the exam in person a week after grad ceremony.",

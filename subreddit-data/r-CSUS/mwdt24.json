When I transferred to Sac State I was required to provide proof of these vaccines and when I found out I was missing some I had to get them before Fall 2020 ended otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have been able to register even though classes were fully online at the time. Technically you\u2019re supposed to have these vaccines too so the only reason you haven\u2019t been required to get them yet is due to some administrative error",

Just saw a poll yesterday stating that like 70% of conservative voters said they do not plan to get the vaccine, while only 9% of progressives said the same. Most who responded negatively to getting the vaccine also said they would happily use falsified vaccine cards should the opportunity present itself. Without 75-80% vaccination we will be stuck in cyclical Covid bouts, leaving room for all sorts of new variants all the while keeping things shut down and/or at limited service, in perpetuity. If these small minded and selfish people don\u2019t have their views challenged, they\u2019ll be the ones at fault for keeping life the way it\u2019s been for the last 13 months. I appreciate what your saying, and I usually try to apply it because it simply saves me energy and despair.

The only reason the article cites for seeking full approval is due to a consistent efficacy throughout increased trials. Maybe I misunderstood how emergency use worked but I had thought it was also related to the lack of long term data but the article does little to further explain that point. I think people are concerned about the long term risks of this vaccine and anyone who defends it just says it\u2019s a risk we need to take. Is the speed at which this vaccine developed not part of the reason it was only approved in emergency use? Or was it only questions about the vaccines efficacy at the moment?",

I mean it's a yearly thing, and with covid even varients of concern are still showing vulnerability to the vaccine (but not as much with prior infection). Almost all vaccines you get need boosters at some point. So why does any effectively results over 1 year (looking very likely and maybe longer) not long enough?\n\nUse of the mRNA biggest hurdle for vaccine was getting it into cells without the mRNA breaking down, we seem to have unlocked that step as shown by the effective protection from SARS-COV-2. Truly, this is likely going to unlock a new generation of vaccines, once the delivery is figured out, the mRNA is the easy part with our understanding of how mRNA works naturally. \n\nThe effects on health are rare. Even with the J&amp;J that was pulled, it was something like .005% of injection had the adverse reaction that caused it to be pulled. COVID 19 has a 1% of death, where as the J&amp;J had a nearly 100% protection from death. I mean I don't blame you, humans are really bad at considering the true odds of things, loss aversion is a hell of a thing.",

I understand your argument and I feel you, but if it's no longer just \"emergency use\" and the FDA fully approves it for regular use, then by FDA standards it's just as safe as the other vaccines you probably have.\n\nI somewhat agree though. I've been vaccinated already, but I think requiring it *this* early to return to campus is a little ridiculous. There is not enough public trust in the vaccine, and there isn't equitable access. Also, we don't know how secure our supply is w/o the J&amp;J vaccine.",

The worst thing is seeing those that rationalize the decision based on what the government (FDA/CDC) says. As if the government is infallible; the bearer of absolute truth to them.\n\nAnd tolerating a public university to have the authority to mandate this same sketchy new drug sets a dangerous precedent many people don't seem to consider...keep giving them inches and they'll soon be ahead miles. \n\nAlas, ready the downvotes. We will use the old ways.",

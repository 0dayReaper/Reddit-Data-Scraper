    "postText": "i want to ask those who took English 10/11 and English 5 +1 what they experienced in their first year English's course. I'm currently completing the DSP to be placed in either one but i want to hear other students experience in those classes because English's isn't my strongest subject and i have pretty bad procrastination towards it. I have a interest in English 5 +1 because completing English in one semester sounds good but how effective are the small groups and instructors there?",

From what I\u2019ve heard from other people as well, more work is actually done in 5M and 10/11 (I think this is to help with skill development) compared to normal Engl 5. I had Amy Anderson for English 5, she is super nice &amp; she will work with you so you get the grade you want to achieve. If you go with Engl 5 , I\u2019d recommend to take the class with Amy Anderson.",

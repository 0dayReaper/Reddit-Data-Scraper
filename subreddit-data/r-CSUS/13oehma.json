    "postText": "Hi I\u2019m a 22F I\u2019m living at the hornet commons and wanted to see who wanted to take over my lease. It ends in August but I\u2019m sure extensions are available. It\u2019s a 4 bed 2 bath, right now there\u2019s no one else living at the apartment, it\u2019s $960 a month, I don\u2019t have a parking pass but with people moving out I\u2019m sure you can get a parking pass for $50. If interested send me a DM",

            "comment": "Hello,\n\nI went through the same program (single subject social science) from 2019 - 2020. After the program, I have been teaching World &amp; U.S. History in Middle School, which is different from the age group I student-taught with.\n\nTo preface, my experiences are most likely pretty different from what yours would be since mine was a while ago and was also interrupted by Covid. Overall, their teaching program in general was excellent preparation for the expectations of teaching in our area and I feel that I benefitted a lot from the program. To be more specific, the program was very intensive for me with all of the expectations in classes and student-teaching, but was great preparation for how intensive it can be in teaching.\n\nI should say that your potential experience in the program can be very different from your peers. Student-Teacher placement, cooperating teacher, and your supervisor can make the experience very different from person to person. Some people I knew had a great work to life balance while others, including myself, had a lot of difficulty in managing that balance.\n\nFor the actual classes and student-teaching, I had good experiences in both. The required classes for everyone regardless of subject-matter are pretty straight forward and I enjoyed working with the professors and peers. The social studies classes were definitely the highlight as they are the most applicable. Great professors and most of all, you get time to talk and work with people in the same position, definitely make use of it (also made a lot of great friends through this who are also now teaching.) For student-teaching, I got to teach at high school and had a pretty good experience (I still regularly talk with my former cooperating teacher.) Again, will be dependent on your placement but overall just getting out there and learning to teach is the best possible experience you can get from the program.\n\nWhile the program can be a lot, I really do think it is some of the best preparation you can have for teaching. Big piece of advice I would have for any prospective student is to actively advocate for yourself. Reach out for support with your professors, your peers, your cooperating teacher, anyone that can help and support you. In general, teaching is much easier and positive when you have a network of people you can go to for help. I would also add that it is important to recognize that you will be placed in a position where the responsibility of determining what is most important (balancing between the program and student-teaching) is up to you. Focus on who you want to be as a teacher and be confident in taking care of yourself first.\n\nAnyways, that is a lot of rambling. If you have any specific questions or want any insight into teaching, please let me know, I would love to help out. Hope this helps!",

            "comment": "I just graduated from the credential program. I spent about 60 hours a week between my placement, school, and homework. It wasn't very difficult, just extremely time consuming. Tbh it was the worst experience of my life but they are changing the program to be less shitty for the candidates. Hopefully you'll have it better than I did. Be prepared to completely give up your life for the entirety of the program. Good luck, hope this helped!",

I will probably call the school now and see if there's any info.\n\nedit: called registrars office and they said it could be 1-2 weeks at minimum for it to show up on unofficial transcript. they said the fastest way is to order the transcript through Parchment and select the \"wait for degree\" option and that those who do that will be put on priority list for transcript with degree indicated.",

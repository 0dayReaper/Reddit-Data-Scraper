I enjoyed it since I was learning about the stuff that I consume on a daily basis, which made it all the more interesting and relatable. For me, the class wasn\u2019t particularly difficult, as long as you managed your time well and submitted your work before the deadline. Grade weighs heavily on weekly assignments, 4 quizzes (\u201cexams\u201d), and 4 papers with varying writing requirements. Open notes on everything, and don\u2019t worry about reaching word limits because there\u2019s generally a lot to discuss. Anyway, good luck! Hope you guys enjoy the course as I did :)",

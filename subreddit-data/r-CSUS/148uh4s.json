Three of my preferred classes are still open so I should really be grateful for that in itself, but now I have to find another alternative for my upper division humanities requirement, as all of them I selected just say closed but 2/3 aren't full.\n\nWhy does CSUS make this process as stressful as possible????",

I can just tell it is not designed for people to get into classes? Which does not make sense for a school but whatever i guess.\n\nI'm planning on switching to the CCE program in the spring, hopefully it's a little better.",

It\u2019s not that common this close to the start date, but just as someone above said, it\u2019s likely a temporary hold for the incoming students to have a chance to get in!",

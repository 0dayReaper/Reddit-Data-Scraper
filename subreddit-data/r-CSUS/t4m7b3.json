I don't know if Dr. Kvaljian still shows his face (or if he's passed) but he would also know.\n\nI do know that there used to be a lot of orchard trees around that section from when there was a larger ag department (think 1950s). There are still carob trees in front of star bucks leftover as exotic orchard species of the time. I think around the time they redid that area those pears were very popular (late 80s early 90s). They were sold based on looks to people who didn't know better. \n\nBut it would still smell if they weren't there. The arboretum (one of the finest on the west coast) is full of gingko trees which smell... stronger. And are messier. They are ancient and part of an exhibit, just a few trees in front of these.",

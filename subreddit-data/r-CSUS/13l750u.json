My cumulative gpa is still at a 3.0 after this year. \nI\u2019m assuming I will most likely get my admission revoked. Is there anything else I can do and how likely will I be able to attend?",

Worst thing that happened from it was getting put on academic probation, which I pretty easily got out of. Getting 3 Ds sucks, I hope you're doing okay, but no you're not going to get your admission revoked. I'm not even sure you'd get on probation for that. Maybe if we were some top tier Ivy League school or something you might have something to worry about, but definitely not here. Keep your head up, you'll do just fine. Retake whatever you need to in another semester",

I haven\u2019t heard anything about the counseling program, good or bad, and was curious as to whether anybody could vouch for the program. Or, if anybody could warn me about the program, haha! Thanks!",

Any specialty is ready for the LPCC license plus their additional specialty license. I will just mention that the MCFC one is the hardest to get into (a little less than 10% admission rate) as it\u2019s the most popular. They only take 20 students for each specialty each year and there\u2019s over 200 applicants for MCFC every time. Feel free to PM me if there\u2019s any specific questions you might have that I can help you with! \ud83d\ude0a",

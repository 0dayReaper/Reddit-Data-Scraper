I think he did an overall pretty good job on running the university. I know there are some things people didn\u2019t like but I think he has done a lot of good for Sac State.",

I can give him the benefit of the doubt, it is very likely he had his hands tied on issues like veterans benefits, fees, disability resources, etc. but we\u2019ll never figure out who is actually running this school into the ground.",

But only if I get to select the Bible verses:  \nEzekiel 23:20   \nThere she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses.  \n\n\nNumbers 31:17-18   \nNow therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man intimately. But all the girls who have not known man intimately, spare for yourselves.   \n\n\nLeviticus 25:44-46   \nYou may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you. You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land. You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance. You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel, your relatives, must never be treated this way.",

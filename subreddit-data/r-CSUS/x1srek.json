Hornet and friends) as they were on their way to class in Douglass Hall and that a clean-up crew had to come and clean up the gruesome scene. \n\nAt first, I freaked out, but towards the end of the post, I assumed that this was a joke. A lot of people asked what the OP meant by their post, but so far the OP didn\u2019t explain anything.",

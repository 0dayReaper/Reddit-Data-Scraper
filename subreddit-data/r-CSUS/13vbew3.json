Don\u2019t do it the only benefit is meeting Asian people and having Asian friends and potentially finding an Asian wife. My sister did the whole thing and it was a waste of her time. My colleagues also agree.",

I wouldn't call a class teaching you about the past especially about your culture useless and they do cover a few ge requirements as well. There's actually a few benefits from the program like getting the green/gold certificate which helps you become a leader and other stuff too! They have fun events as well!",

There is probably little chance that the CSU system is going to let students return for fall semester. \n\nSomeone has to be first. If it\u2019s not going to be High tech then there is a good chance it won\u2019t be us either.  I know that many people can\u2019t come back. \n\nI hope that for those of us who can get the option to return. \n\nI\u2019ve spent the last ten years of my life working dead end jobs. Graveyard, Swing Shift, Doubles. Hot summers outside, cold winters outside. All to be here. To learn. To finish my degree. To keep promises I made to myself and people who are gone. \n\nI hope we get to return. \n\nMy heart goes out to those of you who are suffering. Stay strong!",

    "postText": "Update I: if you know someone who may be struggling, or even someone you think could benefit from a pizza after a stressful week - please feel free to forward my post to someone you may know. \n\nUpdate II: Those who submitted requests to be considered have been contacted, and this submission has been closed. Thank you to everyone for all the awards and upvotes. I did this as a means of reaching out to our fellow students who may be  struggling, as well as a way for me to give back to my community. I\u2019m so touched to see how many students, alumni, and faculty have PMed me in support of this cause. Take care all, and best of luck to you for the rest of the semester! \n________________________________________________\n\n2020 has been an incredibly hard year, and for many Fall has been an even harder semester. I know financial aid has been delayed for so many students, and with the holidays and finals looming - stress is at an all time high. \n\nWith that being said, if you are struggling to make ends meet, worried about where your next meal is coming from, feeling overwhelmed, or even suffering from stress or anxiety - I would like to buy your pizza Friday night to be delivered to wherever you are. \n\nI\u2019m not asking for anything in return, only that you forward on this kindness to someone else when you can. \n\nReply to this post with just a brief explanation of why you should be picked, and on Friday morning I will choose 5 fellow students to PM for their details to have their dinner sent to. I know it\u2019s not much, but I certainly hope it helps whatever you\u2019re going through. \n\nTake care, and best of luck through the rest of the semester and 2020.",

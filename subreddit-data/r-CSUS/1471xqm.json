Wifi is another $20 I believe) starting on\nAugust 22nd.\nSame date as the move in. It's a 4\u00d72, fully furnished apartment. Parking is also available as part of the lease.\nWasher and dryer unit is also available inside the unit.\nBelow are some pictures of the unit!\n\nHERE IS A LINK TO A VIRTUAL TOUR FROM THEIR TIKTOK:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTREqwkDn/\n\nYou would have your own single room but share a bathroom with 1 other housemate. In total you would possibly have 3 other housemates. It is off campus student housing but they will also make exceptions for non-students! * LET ME KNOW, I will work with you anyway possible!! Any gender is welcome to sign as well",

The only extra would be wifi.\nThey do have a history of roaches but maybe like 2-3 years ago. And if you\u2019re a clean person, you shouldn\u2019t have that problem regardless lol. They have done a great job of taking care of everything. I had a great experience and so did a lot of my friends. But everyone's experience could be different anywhere, don't take a bias opinion.",

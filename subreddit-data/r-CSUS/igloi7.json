            "comment": "The professor probably used his book because in his opinion, it's the material that is well presented and he knows the content of the book really well.  I think the book price is determined by the publisher.  My PhD advisor wrote my general chemistry book (really good book).  But he also used to complain to me how the publisher intentionally did a poor job with the binding so that it was more likely to not get circulated in used book market.  It really irritated him, but he had not control over the binding.  Also - the professor puts A LOT of time into writing books, but the publisher gets a huge portion of the profit.   The professor will constantly be pushed to make a new edition (so that they can remove old book from circulation).     Also another interesting fact:  when a faculty publish an article in a journal, they don't own the copyright to the article.  The article is property of the journal.  \n\n\nMy wife is a professor at Sac State.   She uses a combination of free books (an ebook that she help write) and published books.  In addition, when she negotiates books with publishers, she makes them provide her with free copies that she checks out to students who otherwise cannot afford books.  If the publisher refuses, she finds another publisher.  It always works.",

Looking back on it, I should have just gone without the book or photocopied and returned it.

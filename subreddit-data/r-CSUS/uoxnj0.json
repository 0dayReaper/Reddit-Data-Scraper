You are going to deal with Todd who doesn't want to work on their part of the assignment until 1 day before. \n\nProfessors need a way to grade based off of group + individual effort. If you have the ability you can always talk to your professor about someone who is not pulling their weight. I'm not one for telling on people but if you need to graduate and someone is not doing their work because university is a vacation for them, morally just let the professor know. A lot of the time they can understand , especially when your work speaks for itself. \n\nalso if you are that person who doesn't care, no one likes you.",

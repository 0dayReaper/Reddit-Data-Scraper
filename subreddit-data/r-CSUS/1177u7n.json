    "postText": "So we pay $161 a semester to pay for athletics - that\u2019s in addition to the money they also get from tuition.  \n\nMy roommates friend is on the softball team. They spent almost a week in Puerto Vallarta at an all-inclusive resort because they went to play in a tournament there!?!    The athletes had to pay nothing.  Why does a softball team have so much money? The coaches families also went!?!  Why am I taking out loans to help pay for tuition if this is what it\u2019s being used for?\n\nMy chemistry lab doesn\u2019t have enough funding to pay for paper for our copier and the Black Student Union doesn\u2019t get enough money from the school to host speakers. My roommate is working 3 jobs to help pay for school.   Why isn\u2019t Sac State helping her by sending her on an all expenses paid vacation at a resort in Mexico?\n\nThe State Hornet should do a story in this. It seems messed up.",

I pay heavily out of pocket due to limited funding from the school for extracurriculars (mainly my club sport team). Thankfully money isn\u2019t much of a concern for me at the moment, but I sympathize heavily with those like your chem partner. Nobody should have to sell their soul to receive a college education just to see the school pour money into programs for certain students because they hit a ball hard.",

            "comment": "Universities get away with this based on two common myths they continue to spread like the plague: \n\n1. College sports bring school spirit. \n\nNow this one is more believable just 10 years ago. However, with the struggling economy and increasing hardships students go through, we have significantly less school spirit as previous generations. \n\n2. College sports are a good source of income \n\nThis has never been true. A somewhat recent study found that only 24 public schools had sports programs that were self sufficient. Meaning the other 206 public universities had a net loss from their athletic programs and often lose millions of dollars every year. We are not one of those 24 public schools. For example in 2019 the athletics program caused a 3.3 million dollar deficit. We directly pay for those loses through our tuition, fees, and tax dollars. You should be outraged. \n\nSource:\n\nhttps://www.si.com/.amp/college/2015/05/27/ncaa-athletics-finances-revenue-expenses-oregon-texas",

When I want to college (before most of you were born), the students voted to build new fitness center and athletic facility.  The cost was passed on to future students.  My understanding, students are still paying today to pay for the new facility.   \n\n\nI also agree with you that sport programs are highly over-rated.   I read somewhere that the highest paid position at most universities are the coaches.  The athletes gets a lot of perks.  But then again - it's just a reflection of our society screwed up priorities.",

When I was at UCD, those were funds per area so like if we were doing engineering, someone could say it goes to FSAE but it doesn't. It goes into an engineering general fund and then it gets divided out. Nothing the donor says is held tight. If they're concerned, they need to donate directly",

    "postText": "Hey, all, I'm an English Major and I believe that I'm currently done with all of my courses. After this next week, my papers \\*should\\* be graded and I feel as though I'm going to have decent grades within my Senior Seminar class, so I should be able to graduate.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit concerned. My Student Center DOES NOT list the Portfolio Project class (ENGL 198X) as a necessary course to take in my \"Academic Requirements\", yet I've been looking around and there are multiple worksheets that I've seen which list it as being required.\n\nIs ENGL 198X is a legitimately required course? I didn't take it because I thought that the Student Center would tell me if I needed it or not and it didn't, but I'm kinda freaking out right now because I thought that I'd be able to graduate without taking it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-------- UPDATE: I went to the department chair's office and in less than 5 minutes, they told me that I was totally fine :) as some people in the comments of this post have said, it depends on when you enrolled. I enrolled in 2019 and, because of this, my requirements weren't the same as the current catalog, so I'm free to graduate! Thank you to all of those who helped and commented :)",

Student Center isn't always accurate and shouldn't be trusted. ~~You can use any catalog year since you started attending. Like if they've changed your major requirements halfway through, you can choose to go by the \"before\" or \"after\" catalogs, any year you were enrolled.~~ **edit: sorry I was mistaken, it's either the catalog from when you started at any CC/CSU, when you started at Sac State, or from when you graduate, those are the 3 choices. It's called \"catalog rights\". Looks like 198x was added as a requirement starting 2020-21. Hopefully you are eligible to use 2019-20 catalog or earlier?**\n\nIf you messed up, you can appeal to/beg your department chair to make an exception since Student Center was wrong. There was a post here a few years back where some official department form had the wrong classes listed, so some students got exceptions. Unfortunately they had to make a huge stink to get that to happen.",

It makes me wonder why we use it at all.\n\nThe Department Catalog does say that I need to have it, but the Student Center says absolutely nothing. I might make a case to appeal to them because the Student Center doesn't list it, but I don't know if I should even go through the trouble because it feels like I just relied too heavily upon one source.\n\nOh well. Thank you, anyways!",

It's based on date of first attendance, not anything about when you entered the major :) So you are good to go. That might also explain why your Student Center doesn't show 198x, it might be defaulting to the requirements from your first semester.",

Yes I know it\u2019s a terrible grade and I\u2019m not proud of it but can someone tell me what letter grade this is. I\u2019m hoping for a C- hopefully but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not.",

You might have to look up sac state grade forgiveness policy but I had a C- before and retook it next semester and ended up with a A and it just replaced it in my gpa the C- will still show up on your transcript but it will say something like not counted towards final gpa or something like that you don't need to retake it as its not a fail depending on the course though!",

[https://www.csus.edu/comments/](https://www.csus.edu/comments/) It would be documented complaints that the school probably pays way more attention to than the YouTube video comments. Its probably a better way to hold them accountable.\n\nI have been trying to comment this on the YouTube video, but after each time I post it, the comment gets taken down a few minutes afterwards. It's making me really frustrated, because students should be able to let their opinion be heard.",

If you ask him to put one he might. Dropping out of a class because of one person seems a little extreme. Your going to deal with different minded all your life. I\u2019d suggest a different coping method then dropping out. Especially if we are going back to in person there\u2019s going to be more then that one prick. Learn to respect their view and know your view should be respected as well. I also didn\u2019t get Covid because I wasn\u2019t wearing a mask, I got it from my partner.

Thankfully we were all wearing masks to I didn't get it. It's pretty selfish to essentially say that \"I'll be okay, so it doesn't matter if I put others at risk.\" I have an 11-month-old baby who obviously can't be vaccinated. Others may live with family who can't be vaccinated or who are immunocompromised and could still die from Covid. We shouldn't need to be put at risk by our classmates when simply wearing a mask is still very effective and a reasonable policy until the infection numbers come down to a more manageable level.\n\nIt's good you are willing to put on a mask when asked, but many are afraid to ask since often those who don't wear masks tend to get heated or confrontational when asked. So just do us a favor and wear a mask when you are supposed to.",

I know plenty of people who have newborns and refuse to get vaccinated themselves. And like you said even with your group being vaccinated and wearing mask people still got sick. So do everyone a favor and worry about yourself. There is plenty of methods you can do to keep yourself safe that don\u2019t involve someone else wearing or not wearing a mask. It\u2019s interesting that asking someone to put on a mask is scary but blasting them and potentially name dropping a student with different views on Reddit is acceptable. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f this argument can last forever.

The people from my group got Covid outside of school when they were not wearing masks. Having to wear them at school prevented it from spreading. I never advocated doxing someone for not wearing a mask, so I don't know how that even applies. I have no problem asking someone to wear a mask, but I shouldn't have to when it is policy.\n\nI've already worked in healthcare for many years, so the idea of wearing a mask around communicable diseases does seem normal to me and I'm fine living the rest of my life taking normal precautions like this when the times call for it. I'm sure someone like you once said \"are we really willing to spend the rest of our lives washing our hands after we wipe our butts? Cholera isn't going away so why bother?\"",

As a film major many of us are dependent on in person collaboration, working on sets, and teamwork. These things are crucial for our major courses and especially for our capstone. It\u2019s just impossible to get the proper experience/learning online but obviously other majors are different. Regardless of majors, all students should have the right to choose between online and in person education.",

You applied to a face-to-face campus for a reason, Sac State isn't accredited for online instruction, it's not their problem you live far and have work you make time for school because you care about your education. Only valid reason for wanting online classes is because this virus is still very present and going in person will spike cases at sac state like crazy and make it hard for us students to visit loved ones.",

Those who applied to sac state knew this was mostly a face to face campus. I\u2019ve done undergrad and masters here and before the pandemic took only one class online because it was all offered in person. If a major isn\u2019t offered online it\u2019s probably because of accreditation and the major is probably one that HAS to be face to face. My grad major HAS to be in person the only exception being now with COVID. However, as soon as we\u2019re cleared to do so we are in person and last semester a few classes were hybrid. I think with a lot of students would like to stay online out of the convenience of it. However, I agree we all applied to sac state knowing it\u2019s intended to be a face to face environment. By entering a major that isn\u2019t offered regularly online as a student you know what you\u2019re signing up for.",

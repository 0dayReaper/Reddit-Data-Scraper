    "postText": "Hi everyone! I am a recent grad from a CC and got accepted to both of these schools as a transfer. I am also a pre-med who plans to go towards an O.D. (Doctor of Optometry) and was wondering what school would be better in terms of admissions/experience for optometry schools. I also do not receive any type of financial aid so I would have to take up loans anyway. My plan is to graduate as soon as possible with all my pre-requisites and wanted to know which school could help me get lower division classes without much trouble (Chem, Bio, Anatomy and things of that nature). Are these classes hard to get with a decent professor at this school? My declared major at UC Davis is Human Development and Sac State is Nutrition and Food (planning on swapping towards Exercise Science) Thank you all for the help!",

I would also assume since they have a medical school they will have really good programs for premedical students. \n\nI like Sacramento State, but I dont think its worth it compared to UC-Davis, getting into classes is terrible here, you will need to be part of some club or association to get those early enrollment dates. \n\n**Controversial to say but the easier a school is to get into means that you are going to be with a wide range of students who didn't need to try as hard to get in, which means some of those habits may stick,** which means it *can* be harder to find students who have the same worth ethic as you. This is especially true in the CS department where a lot of students I have met don't code at all in their spare time and have hard time making node classes well into their upper divs. \n\nTLDR: UC DAVIS is a great school for a premed, and you only need to spend 2 years so just go to the name brand school which has the medical school in it already.",

            "comment": "Enrolled students were already able to choose their classes and most seats that are saved for incoming students were saved for freshmen. I'm not saying classes will be impossible to get when you enroll during orientation, but it would be difficult getting everything you want this semester. Classes are easier to get (depending on the size of the major/how many classes/how many seats/etc.) when you're already an enrolled student.\n\nI like Sac and I don't regret going here, but I would look into the programs you want to go into in each college and compare professors. If possible, attend both orientations and see which one is a better fit. UC Davis IS known for its medical program tho. Also--it might be a good idea to look into financial aid anyways just in case.",

The UEI positions you see on handshake will require you to submit a resume and continue to the UEI site to do a full application. So make sure you complete both steps if you apply through Handshake for a UEI job. For all other positions on campus, the handshake application (and whatever resume/documents are requested by employers) is all you\u2019ll need.",

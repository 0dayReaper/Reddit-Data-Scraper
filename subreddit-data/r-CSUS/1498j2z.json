You apply using the same general scholarship application at the link above. More info: https://www.csus.edu/international-programs-global-engagement/international-student-scholar-services/forms-resources.html\n\nThese are only the school-affiliated scholarships. You can also apply to private scholarships, but you have to find them yourself and apply separately.",

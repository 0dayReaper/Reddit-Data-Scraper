    "postText": "Hey everyone! \nI'm looking for somebody to take over my lease at the Element Apartments. It is $915/month (everything included!!) starting on August 22nd. Same date as the move in. It's a 4\u00d72, fully furnished apartment. Parking is also available as part of the lease.\nYou would also have your own single room but share a bathroom with 1 other housemate. (You will possibly have 3 other housemates) It is off campus student housing but they will also make exceptions for non-students! :) LET ME KNOW ASAP! I will work with you anyway possible!!\nEDIT: HERE IS A LINK TO A VIRTUAL TOUR FROM THEIR TIKTOK\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTREqwkDn/",

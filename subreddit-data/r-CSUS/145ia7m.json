    "postText": "I know many students here still live at home or have roommates - this seems like an ideal situation for this school. I also know that Sac State doesn\u2019t work super well with a 9-5 M-F full time job (from what I\u2019ve been told). For those of you who DO work full time to support yourself while going to school here - what jobs have you found to be flexible enough for classes while still paying enough to survive without roommates? Is it possible at all? (Specifically referring to undergrad. I know that the masters programs are much more accommodating) \n\nI welcome and appreciate your thoughts!",

I talked to my supervisor and department head to let them know my goals and also my strategy to minimize my time off.  My strategy was to take as many classes at ARC as possible because they have a lot of online only or afternoon and evening classes.  Once I exhausted those, I took only Tuesday/Thursday classes as late in the day as possible to minimize my time off. Then when the only classes left for me were daytime classes, I took only Tuesday/Thursday classes and try to pack as many in as possible into one semester. Luckily it all worked out, and I only had to do it for one semester which was last semester. One more class in the fall and I graduate. \ud83d\ude01",

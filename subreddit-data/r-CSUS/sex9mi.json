I understand that isn\u2019t your intention and also see the point of view of coming back in person. None of the reasons for in person learning stand up to the fact that not being able to learn online is going to magically improve by being back in person. A lot of what college is consists of being assigned topics that you find outside resources for that work for your style of learning. I argue online let\u2019s us pursue that the best. I wish the best to you all.",

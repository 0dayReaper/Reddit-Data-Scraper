    "postText": "Hi!\n\n I am looking for someone to take over my lease at Wexler for July. I am fully asynchronous for summer so I decided to move back home. I have a B1 apartment at Wexler. I have one roommate and we both have our own private bedroom and bathroom. My apartment is at a super convenient location. It is in the same building as the leasing office and mail room. My apartment is the closest one to the parking garage where my car is. I pay $1400 a month. The apartment is perfectly fine, I am just willing to help someone get in there because if not, it will just be sitting for an entire month and I might as well be throwing the money away. Renters insurance wifi and parking is included.\n\nPlease shoot me a DM if interested!",

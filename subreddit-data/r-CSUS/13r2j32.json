    "postText": "I'm in kind of a tough spot right now.\nI got rejected from most UCs besides UC Merced, so I'm kind of down to these options. I toured both SFSU and CSUS, and to be honest I didn't like either too much. It seemed like campus life was pretty dead at both, and I don't like sac too much as a city being from the bay. However, I want to hear from some students and not just dismiss CSUS entirely. My original plan was just to go somewhere and transfer out to a better college in a year, but I want to try and hear out going to CSUS. Is the social life here really dead? I can't live in the dorms, so are any good apartment options close? Is it worth it to attend, or should I just go to cc for something better if there's no college experience here? For some background, I'm an incoming freshman poli sci major.",

            "comment": "So I don\u2019t really know much about student life bc I\u2019m a full time grad student who is also working full time, and I worked full time while I was at Sac State for undergrad. I pretty much show up just in time for classes and then I leave right after class lol. What I will say is that a lot of Sac folks don\u2019t like Bay Area transplants who move here and complain about how much they hate Sac. There\u2019s literally a whole brand called \u201cSacramento Hates You Too\u201d. If you come to Sac State with that energy that you don\u2019t really like this place, you\u2019re probably gonna have a bad time. \n\nI suggest checking out r/Sacramento and seeing if there\u2019s anything mentioned there that interests you, and if you\u2019re in the bay, making a day trip out here to check stuff out in person. To give you a brief rundown of what the sac subreddit has to offer without the complaints about allergies, the unhoused, bad drivers, and inflation, we got: good coffee, croissants, cool bridge (Tower), cheap &amp; massive sandwiches, breweries that seem to be mostly run by sexist men, biking, river floats/rafting/kayaking (but not right now, water\u2019s too high &amp; fast), nice sunsets, sideshows, conventions for stuff you didn\u2019t know warranted a convention, Kings games &amp; The Beam. There\u2019s a lot of night life downtown and other random events like free movies in the park, on May 4th everyone meets at Fremont park for a massive lightsaber battle, stuff like that. Not sure what you\u2019re into but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something here to accommodate it! \n\nAlso my understanding of our poli sci major is that it is a good one. We are the Capitol of California and our local Assemblymember is a CSUS alum.",

That\u2019s ultimately not what you\u2019re there for. \n\nSince you are young like most students, as long as you\u2019re personable and friendly you should have no problems finding a social circle at sac state. I did not make friends the two years I was there (transfer student from cc) maybe because I didn\u2019t feel like I fit in with the freshly 20 year olds. But you have this advantage with your age. \n\nSorority scene is very active at sac state, and as long as you involve yourself, sac state can be a great option if you just apply yourself accurately. Also I hear going to the club every Thursday is a big thing for students. Downtown is also fun if you like doing the city thing. \n\nIt\u2019s entirely what you make of it.",

            "comment": "\nCSUS itself is regarded  as a commuter college. Most people come from surrounding towns from Sacramento or the Central Valley. I however, had the opportunity to live in the dorms for a few years, but really kept to myself. Most people in fact, campus residents or not, kept to themselves. Not really any parties or huge social events going on, but I liked it that way. Some people really want the college experience of making connections and having fun, but others just want to get their degree and leave. CSUS is more for the latter, but the city itself does offer a nice community feel with lots of parks, hole in the wall stores, suburban areas, shopping centers, farmlands, and an extremely diverse cultural climate. It may not have an immediate attraction like the Bay Area or SoCal to some people, but its nice and mellow around here and I appreciate that as someone coming from the Central Valley (Modesto specifically).",

I just graduated from Sac State and honestly what you put in is exactly what you get out of it. There are tons of organizations and clubs for you to join and put yourself out there for if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for in terms of socialization. I was able to find that by joining various organizations. I will say I did not like it my first semester but after I got used to it and started putting myself out there, I loved it. It is a commuter school so that\u2019s why a lot of students are really there to just go to class but there are so many opportunities to socialize especially during the first week when all organizations begin to table! I may be biased because I truly loved Sac State after getting into the hang of things and because of the clubs I joined, but I hope you keep an open mind! Ultimately you know what is best for yourself and if it\u2019s not Sac State that\u2019s okay!",

    "postText": "So I retook two classes I failed last semester. Now that grades are in, I checked my unofficial transcript and it did not replace the old grades and units for those classes. Instead it added the units to last semester\u2019s total. I\u2019m a bit confused. Does it take time for the grade forgiveness to be applied?",

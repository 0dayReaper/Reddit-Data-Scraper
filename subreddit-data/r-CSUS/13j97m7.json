There are 2 essays, one at the start of the semester and one at the end (the final), but they are basically about yourself and what you think about history so it's the easiest essay topic you could have. The reading questions are normally 1-3 questions and each are about a paragraph. My classmates liked asking for extensions and she easily obliged, so it doesn't hurt if you want to ask her for some as well. The readings are very boring though, and I highly recommend looking online for free versions.\n\nAlso the final is \"pick and choose.\" She gives you about 8 topics you learned in lecture beforehand so you can prepare. There's 6 to choose from on the final and you won't know which ones they are, but you only need to answer for three. You can basically do all of the final before it's released and just copy and paste it when it does.",

He's an easy grader, and if you just take some brief notes during lectures, you'll get an A. You can pretty much write essays about whatever you want. I wrote my last paper on why Captain America became a staple of American pop culture during WWII. Nice guy, will get sidetracked sometimes, but it's always about popular culture",

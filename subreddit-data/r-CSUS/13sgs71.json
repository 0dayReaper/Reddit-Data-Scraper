Got A\u2019s in everything else so it balances out. The dream of graduating with over a 3.5 is still alive. Now I\u2019m worried about summer classes and getting A\u2019s in those.

Have a little quiz that involves looking at plants. \n\nJepson ID is a skill and its come in handy MANY times after graduating. I hope you'll appreciate it when you're not so stressed out.",

I was stressing all semester because honestly, I didn't read a damn thing in any of my classes all semester because of intense personal/family issues. I somehow absorbed enough info from going to every class that I got 3 As &amp; 1 A- (also extremely last minute studying / catching up on everything). Proud of you/us!",

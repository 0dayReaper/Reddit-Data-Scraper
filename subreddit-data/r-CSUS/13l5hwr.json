    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nThis is my second post about this, but I really need someone to take over my lease as I\u2019m graduating!!! \ud83c\udf93\n\nEveryone I\u2019m living with is currently moving out except for 1, so it could be just you and 1 other person in this 4-person room unless HC relocates you or someone else.\n\nAugust 2023 - May 2024; $982/month 2 Bedroom 2 bath, shared; 3rd floor. Includes parking and utilities (unlimited water basically lmao). In-unit washer/dryer, fully furnished with fridge, tv, your own desk, closet space, and dressers. Other amenities include 24hr small gym, bike lockers, and pool.\n\nI\u2019ve been here since they first opened 2 years ago, so I have the lowered rate compared to the base ~$1100. \n\nSomething else people do to save more on rent is buy a semester parking permit for Lot 7. This would drop the rent down to $930/month (and save you ~$200 by the end of the lease term)\n\nDon\u2019t hesitate to dm me, and thanks for reading :)",

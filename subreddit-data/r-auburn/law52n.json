I used to work for auburn. I have some experience dealing with what programs sga has control over and what they don\u2019t. I can almost assure you they were not the responsible party for grubhub or Parker dining. The most ambitious thing the sga did when I worked for auburn was called flunch, a program that allowed students to get lunch with teachers. \n\n\nIt\u2019s ok if you disagree, I\u2019m here to listen to your refusal of what I\u2019m saying.",

Sga is not mentioned in the article. If you can provide evidence that counters that I\u2019m happy to view it\n\nIt makes much more sense to me that a project as ambitious as integrating auburn dining with grubhub (think back end systems, point of sale, changing individual employee duties) would be up to auburn campus dining, not a student representative of the student government association.",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm looking for one female roommate. I will be attending med school so ideally I would like the place quiet (doesn't have to be like pin drop silent but just no parties everyday). I'm pretty chill, dont mind alc, and 4/20 friendly. All I really expect is that you clean up after yourself. My budget is around $500-$600/month. I was looking at a few apartments and have a list. My start date is July 10 so I would have to move in near then. If you're interested, lmk!!",

Not all guys are immature creeps. Just have to be more careful in general. I never had any issues with co-ed roommates because we respected each other's boundaries and I am a very tidy person (like OCD). I started dating and got married though so ended up getting a place of my own. Just an opinion, to each their own.\n\nGood luck!",

They do rent per room but we do share the electricity bill. The rent is $675, but I\u2019ve noticed the price does move up and down lately. Message me if you\u2019d like to hear more, I\u2019m Schuy (Schuyler)!",

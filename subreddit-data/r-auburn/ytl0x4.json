    "postText": "Hi everyone! I am working on a research paper and I find a very interesting  dissertation written by a student from Auburn University. However, as far as I understand I need to be an Auburn student or employee in order to access to the research. I would like to read and review this dissertation, do you know if there is a way me to get an access? \n\nThanks in advance!",

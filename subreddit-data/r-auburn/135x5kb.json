    "postText": "So i have a job interview with dominoes. I dont like coming down town at all. I\u2019m from the country country town of camp hill right down the road from dadeville. We dont have meters down there so ive never used one before. So im sitting here trying to figure this thing out and i try to ask this couple for help. The girl stops and starts to respond but continues walking after she sees her boyfriend keep walking. Like some of these kids in auburn really think theyre in the suburbs. These college students from outside of the area come here with stuck up personalities. Some of these kids cannot be from around here with these attitudes. But i do appreciate the young lady who attempted to help me even though she did not have a car. Did the couple think was gonna ask for them to pay? I literally had a card in my hand. I\u2019m literally try to get a 2nd job to pay bills because getting paid 14.00 a hour is not enough to make it nowadays. I\u2019m freaken frustrated right now. Everytime i come down here my anxiety sky rockets \ud83d\ude2d. I paid for it but it didnt give me a slip.\n\nIf people get alot of scammers down town i apologize but there are people who really need help with these things.",

            "comment": "Sorry bud. It\u2019s finals week for college students so they might be a little more stressed than usual, if that makes any difference.\n\nAs for the meters, some of the older ones are pretty janky but I think the city is replacing them. You don\u2019t need the receipt unless your job reimburses you. Your spot is good for two hours after you paid.\n\nThere\u2019s an app if you have a smartphone and will be paying for parking more regularly, or you can park in that new deck on wright street but that\u2019s paid too.",

I came down town with my best friend, she knew how to use but then again shes from south jersey near philly. So she had no problem figuring it out lol. But  I appreciate the info will take that into consideration next time i choose meters",

These things happen, and I guess one day you'll be able to help someone else out with what you learned.",

Out of town folks aren't shitty, city people aren't shitty, but shitty rich kids are shitty. I can't stand auburn tbh, I've lived here nearly 4 years, and finally about to move out to Jackson's gap, tf away from people \ud83e\udd23\nBut real talk, if you're gonna be delivering here you need to understand that your experience is gonna be similar to 95% of your customers. Fake it til you make it. Act like you run that shit. Don't let them make you feel bad. Also school season is about to end and the town clear out, personally if you don't want to deal with any of that shiz, try Alex City instead. Living between the college town and the lake you have seasonal opportunities, but with the influx of people moving to the lake, it's becoming more steady than just tourist season. I worked in auburn one single football season and I've been at the lake nearly the 2 years since. Way better crowd.",

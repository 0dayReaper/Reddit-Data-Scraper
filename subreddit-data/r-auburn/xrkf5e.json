            "comment": "For those that are asking for more context I can help try and explain. People within the university staff are leaving in MASS quantities. Create people are leaving for remote or other equal positions for pay that is 1.5 or 2x their current salary. \n\nThe new president realized this and put forth a proposal to increase salaries to keep up with the competitive market. The only problem is for departments like OIT they did not look outside of high education jobs. Which is a big problem because most of the people leaving are exiting higher ed. The other issue is that their comparison to the \u201cmarket\u201d is an analysis on much smaller universities. For example, they compared some OIT jobs to schools in Columbus GA, LaGrange and Jacksonville. These are much smaller schools and with much smaller budgets. \n\nIt\u2019s sad. More and more people are going to be leaving and the university is going to really be struggling to keep good people and attract better talent.",

Auburn University has been a shit show over the last decade.  Two decades ago, the way it's currently run would've been unimaginable.

For a while, they mollified people with merit pay, one time bonuses, a good state retirement system, and the Auburn Family rhetoric.  Then Covid stripped away the notion that we are anything but hired help.  So here we are.  A lot of people can't go elsewhere, but many who can will.",

Ending the remote work trial with essentially zero remote work options was the dumbest thing though and I know quite a few people who decided that was the last straw and they are leaving. Others are only staying because they are close to being vested in the state retirement. I'm considering taking a part-time teaching position because my partner has a really stable well paying position at the university, but compared to what I could get in industry it's sad. I would also never be able to get on a tenure track because my PhD will be from Auburn.",

You could also check the auburn off campus housing Facebook page to see if anyone is looking for a roommate.\n\nA 1 bed in a 4 bed 4 bath at the beacon is $485. They do individual leases so you would be assigned roommates.",

I lived at the beacon for 3 years in a 3 bedroom and I really liked it. You can find all the individual lease apartments by just googling individual lease auburn. Those might be your best bet if you\u2019re worried about space. I\u2019m not sure how much copper beach is now (I think they renamed it to yugo north) but those are the largest apartments in auburn and I lived in one for a year with the rent at $495. Good luck!",

The worst was the apartment freshman year, on South College, while the best was the $400 one on Tichenor. I'm almost afraid to see what my old complexes go for now.",

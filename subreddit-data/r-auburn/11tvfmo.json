Writing articles at the plainsman my editor chopped off most of my articles to plug in stupid shit that the university needed hyping up. Auburn media in general is very kiss-assy reporters with a backbone don\u2019t last long in this town. \n\nThere was one editor that was great during my time there and now he works at the NYT, go figure.",

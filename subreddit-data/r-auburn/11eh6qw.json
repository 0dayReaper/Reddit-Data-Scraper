They were doing it for west nile virus testing but anyways... there were a few traps near those ponds and there were people fishing there a lot.  the traps were just black boxes with dry ice in them basically and someone started using these boxes to take a shit while they were fishing basically on a weekly basis.  I know this lead to them putting up some signs way back them...maybe 2006?",

If you are fishing it's a 6+ hour float with class 1 rapids. You'll need the only one out there until you take out at jail bird Creek. For that reason go with a friend\n\nEdit: for a much more crowded float but bigger fish, the coosa in wetumpka is good. You can launch at the dam below jordan lake and stay there or pay the local kayak float trip business to drop you off and take out at the office. http://www.coosariveradventures.com/",

    "postText": "I am making this post here to reach out the competitive League of Legends Players both in Auburn and at Auburn. I would love to have as many Auburn students in the tournament as possible. I have worked to get people in from Auburn before and the community has benefitted from it as well. I would love to have more! If you would be interested, please see the information below. \n\nPlayers between the ranks of Silver 4 and Plat 1 are eligible to sign up and play! Rules have been created, which I can share with anyone who wants to read over them before signing up! Just shoot me a DM. Last tournament, we were able to raise over $850 for the participants. $400 for first place, $250 for 2nd place, and $200 for Community Fan Favorite Players!\n\nPlayers will be randomly drafted by our captains onto teams, so you are welcome to invite friends to join but know you are not guaranteed to get a spot with them! If you would be interested, I have a good form that I can send to you guys. I will attach the link here ( [https://forms.gle/XAC4va2EH5nEQBVf7](https://forms.gle/XAC4va2EH5nEQBVf7))\n\nIf any of you have any questions, just let me know and I am hoping to see you all signup!\n\nPlease keep in mind the tournament draft is on March 18th and it begins on March 25th. Tournament is set to play for 5 weeks, including Semi's and Finals. We will play matches either Saturday or Sunday of each weekend! This gives you time to 1. get up to rank and 2. get integrated into the community to increase your chances of being picked!",

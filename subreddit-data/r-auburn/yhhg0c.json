We've maybe got a chance with TAMU also being a train wreck this year.\n\nMight want to check out Southern Union CC in Opelika while there.  He might want/need to take some core academics there.  Depending on field of study, he might also want to look at piggybacking a tech certification or two from them while working on his university degree.  They have a great tech school there. Not much to see there on a Sunday, but you could schedule a tech school tour for Monday after your AU tour if time allows.",

If you get into Auburn before 6pm Central time, you can do the free locker room tour. I highly recommend that tour. There is also a memorabilia museum in the basketball arena for all Auburn sports. I think that museum is free to enter. The Aubie exhibit is in the student center, which is near the football stadium. There are several statues around the outside of the football stadium to get pics with. There is also a statue of Charles Barkley outside the basketball arena. I think they still do a show with the Auburn eagles on Fridays before home games too called \u201cfootball, fans, and feathers\u201d.",

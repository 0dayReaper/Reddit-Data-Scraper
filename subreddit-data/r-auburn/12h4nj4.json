There isn't one in Auburn I would trust. But Phenix City, there is a shop called Solemn Ink. Gage is the artist you want. Dude is phenomenal. You get what you pay for. Never get cheap tattoos, and never go to an artist who doesn't have a long wait list. There's a reason they don't have a long wait list.",

Choose one who\u2019s portfolio matches what you are looking to get stylistically and get in touch. Also, give some artistic freedom to whoever you go to, bring the idea and explain what you want and the general parameters but they do this for a living and generally know what looks/works best.",

In auburn, Saint and Sinners is by far the best (it\u2019s where I work). I\u2019m picky with tattoos and have a degree in art so I know my stuff when it comes to it. Josh does incredible work but he\u2019s pricey. If you\u2019re looking to get in before august Tori and I can both get you in soon. I\u2019m on Insta @tateart if you have any questions",

Hands down the best atmosphere and cleanest shop I have been to in this area. His wait might not be that long, reach out to him and ask him if he would be interested in doing what you are thinking. Good luck!",

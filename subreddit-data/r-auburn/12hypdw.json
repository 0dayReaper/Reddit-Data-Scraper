I have had a lot going on recently and Auburn's housing app completely slipped through the cracks and now iv heard there's no more slots for on campus housing\n\nI really want to live on campus as a freshman, is there guaranteed housing for freshman, or am I out of luck. \n\nThanks",

But, they do have an extensive transit system. There are many many places to live around campus that have a transit go through and bring you to center of campus. They go to nearly every surrounding apartment complex and even neighborhoods with a lot of rental houses. So if you not having a vehicle or parking was a concern you can easily resort to that method of getting to campus. I took a transit for 3 years",

You\u2019d probably pay $500-$1500/room.\n\nI love my $475 one bedroom across the street from business building. BUT, as a freshman i mentioned suitemates incase you\u2019re looking for more social interactions.",

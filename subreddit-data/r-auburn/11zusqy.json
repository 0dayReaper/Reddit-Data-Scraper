I like German and Russian lit but those weren't offered as options back then. I think English lit (I guess now British) would be preferable to American English lit.  \n\nDon't people post class and professor reviews for Auburn online?  That may be your best bet for current info.  Good luck.",

I liked both classes; in the before 1600 class we read the Odyssey, Oedipus Rex, Dante's Inferno, and King Lear. If you like mythology stuff I'd recommend that class. The after 1600 class has more modern novels; the class I took had a focus on post-colonial authors as well as a lesson on analyzing film where I got to make a powerpoint analyzing the movie Parasite. Not all the classes teach the same books though. In general, the more modern classes (post 1600/1800/whatever year) will tend to have easier texts to read since the language is less archaic.",

Class wasn't that difficult at all, just ur usual essays and exams. I believe i ended w a high B or A in that class (cant remember too well since i took it my freshman year and i'm a jr now)",

However, if you're looking for something easier, I'd probably suggest taking the \"modern\" literature class for any course since the language will likely be easier to read than the \"early\" ones.",

            "comment": "It occurs to me others might want to do something similar. I couldn't find the frame I wanted, so here's a rundown on how I put it together.\n\nI bought sawtooth hangers and a 2.5 \u00d7 3.5\" frame at a Michael's. Total cost was $6.01.\n\nThe diploma is actually 2 \u00d7 3.5\", but I couldn't find that size anywhere and Michael's has a decent selection of 2.5 \u00d7 3.5\" frames, though none of them came with hangers.\n\nI found the small nails and thin frame difficult to work with. I ended up using adjustable pliers to press the nails in while protecting the frame with some cloth. Make sure you center the hanger first, and I marked the hole locations by pressing the tip of a dead pen into the wood. To help me hold the short nails, I just stabbed them through a folded piece of price sticker from the frame and arched the paper to hold it rigid.\n\nIt sounds like more work than it is, but the whole process was rather cheap and easy.",

The biggest threats from TikTok come from the data collection and the ability for the company to change the algorithm so you are witness to misinformation and propaganda. Here is the kicker, U.S. companies like Twitter and Facebook already do both. Apps like Pokemon Go and any fitness app provide more risk to security (personal and national) than TikTok. \n\nI have no issues with government agencies banning TikTok, or any social media apps for that matter. If it is really a matter of security, four of the top ten mobile games are owned and operated by Chinese companies, while six of the top ten apps are based in China. While many of these apps are \"harmless\" they still collect as much data (and in many cases more) than TikTok. In the end, the biggest threat that comes from TikTok is poor information (believing social media is anything more than entertainment) and the loss of time by constant scrolling. Unfortunately we already have these issues from other social media sites.",

Yes TikTok collects data (there is a big difference between data and information) but not near as much as games like clash of clans which have large data collection centers at tencent (which own most of the major games). Many of these games collect data beyond the game, running in the background or collection of data from web browsers. The fitness apps are the same with background collection and even location data collection. Couple this with the fact that most software now use a third party support company (based in various nations) that is allowed to collect data to provide support and the amount of data that you freely give without a second thought is extreme. \n\nIn the end, all of this data (other than location data from fitness apps in the past by other nations to track our military) isn't very useful for anything more than intrusive advertising. Most of the data that TikTok collects is optional beyond basic information that you have already given out at some point. I'm not an advocate for tick tock, I believe that social media in itself is a danger but if you're going to go after 1 app because of the location then you need to go after all of the apps at that location.",

Also we have proof of government influence upon decisions. Newspapers and news agencies for the most part in this country are also privately owned companies. Social media like Twitter and Facebook do fall under the protection of the 1st amendment because not only do they publish/post opinion pieces they also decide what you see and read. Facebook has already admitted to this and as we are seeing with the information dump coming from Twitter. They also did it in the past via censorship. The censorship was based only on opinions of people who worked at the company and by algorithms that were made up to bias, one side or the other. What your also forgetting is that neither Twitter nor Facebook are private companies. They have stock options which are sold to the public. The minute they did this, they ceased to become a private entity and became a publicly traded company which falls under federal guidelines and jurisdictions. The minute it falls under federal guidelines and jurisdictions. It also has to follow federal law which the amendments happen to be. So by saying they are private company, which is not true, you say they have the legal right to censor anyone they want to. That is the same argument that can be made if Ford motor company decided they only wanted to sell two people who had brown skin and blue eyes. No one else could buy a Ford unless you had brown skin and blue eyes and voted a certain way. Now if Ford motor company started doing that, they would be considered racist and biased. And that they were hindering people's right of choice. But based on your statement they could argue they are a private company and they have the right to sell to whoever they want to. What people have forgotten is that the constitution and it's amendments apply to all American citizens. Just because of your race, political beliefs, religious beliefs, or sexual orientation, you're rights do not outweigh that of somebody else's. That's why they are called equal rights. Everyone has them. Now to be a true private company you can be solely owned or owned by several people or conglomerate as long as you are not traded publicly. That's still falls under individual rights. For example, you own your home and you decide to sell it. You do not go through a brokerage firm or anyone else you decide to sell it yourself. You get to pick and choose who you sell it to. You also get to choose the amount of money you sell it for and you get the state the terms and stipulations upon which it is sold. No one else gets to dictate these rights to you because that is your personal property that you're selling. You can sell it to the highest bidder or you can sell it to the lowest bidder. The choice is yours to make. That's the great thing about individual rights and freedoms. We all enjoy them. I do look forward to hearing your rebuttal on this and your thoughts. As you can see I do not get mad. I do not rant and I do not get spiteful. I enjoy a good debate, especially when it comes to individual rights and freedoms.",

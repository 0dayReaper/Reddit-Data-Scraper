    "postText": "So when I activated my email and everything I set it up to send emails to my auburn account but also send them to my main personal email. The email containing my timeslot slipped through and never came to my personal email, which was the one I was checking as I guess I trusted the system. I therefore missed my timeslot by about 6 days. Am I just SOL for housing selection or am I missing something?",

The only reason I didn't find this entertaining was because I didn't know any of these people.\n\nAs an assignment, I think you went above and beyond, but the idea is super good if executed fully.\n\nLike if you stole this WIRED format\nhttps://youtu.be/kSVQtlQtxCs\nand did this with some of the most infamous/beloved instructors in state schools across the country I could see this being a popular series.\n\nGood job though, for a class project I think the idea above all else was really good.",

Professor was such a jackass he tried having an entire class kicked out of college for 1 missed citation of a scanned soil map.\n\nHis class was also the most insanely hard class  of all engineering classes. He even tried to screw over people on their PHDs. He even would try to report his own GTAs if they didnt grade harshly enough for his liking. \n\nHe was evil. His class, not only had homework assigned every class, he would assign multiple hard homeworks per class (legit 4+ hours of work) we had 90+ homeworks.\n\nAnd all of this is just the tip of the hell that was his class of torture and stress he put us through.",

This is by far the biggest acceptance class in AU\u2019s history (surpassing last year by a couple hundred), so there is simply not enough on-campus housing for incoming students. Again, hopefully everything works out for you and something opens up for you, but my friends in housing say the odds of that happening essentially seem like a lottery at this point.",

I guess it depends on how far down the line you are on the waitlist.\n\nETA:  May 1st should see a lot of options open up (if you haven't seen anything open up before that) as that day is the deadline for everyone to pay their housing deposit.  Those that don't pay their deposit will lose the reservation on their room.",

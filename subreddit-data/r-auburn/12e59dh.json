Do people really ask for and accept rides from random internet strangers?  \n\nI know there was a ride board on campus way back but usually you'd meet that person before you hopped in the car with them to go home at break.  I guess it's not so very different but the potential for a bad outcome seems way more likely than just calling a cab.",

I was out last night and saw a woman with 5 children under 8 and there were a few moments when it looked like she might have needed help.  But I didn't say anything because it might have come off creepy.  But I did keep a discreet eye on the children when she left 3 or 4 of them at the table to make a diaper run for a child.  \n\nThe world has changed since I was a kid and not always for the better.  \n\nFor the record, I have had some wonderful cab rides and some terrible ones. You never know which you get until it's too late.",

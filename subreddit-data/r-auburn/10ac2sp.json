            "comment": "Back during football season, I was just talking to some ole boy at south waiting on a drink. And he was complaining to me about his fraternity getting shitcanned. So I can somewhat confirm SOME fraternity got shutdown not to long ago. But then again he was pretty sloshed it seemed, so who knows. So sloshed in fact that he kept asking what my fraternity was even though I tried to tell him I was 24 and at no point in my life went to auburn. So maybe not the best source of info. I think I eventually I was just like sure dude  I\u2019m \u201cgamma gamma chi\u201d or some goofy random assortment of Greek letters I pulled out my ass and it seemed to satisfy him lol\n\nThough if I was in a frat. I\u2019d wanna be in that one with the premo ass real-estate, right  there on magnolia, nice looking little brick building, across from Ramsey hall I think it is. They got a nice little spot",

                    "comment": "Funny story for that frat house. Back in my undergrad days about 5 of us went to skybar one night together. About midnight a few of our group decided to call it a night, so I let them take my car figuring I would walk the 6 ish miles home or I'd go home with someone else hopefully.\n\n\nLast call rolls around and I didn't have any prospects, so I needed to get to steppin'. I decided on my way out I definitely need something to soak up the last call rounds of doubles, so I went over to McDonald's next door. Lobby was closed, so I did the only logical thing to an inebriated college student, I stood in the drive through line. \n\n\nPlaced my order at the speaker, but when I got to the first window to pay the employee is like \"sorry, you can't be in the drive through without a car\". I'm like, hey I'm drunk, I can't drive what am I supposed to do? So, I turned around, walked to the truck behind me and said, \"Hey, they won't let me get food if I'm not in a car. I'll pay for your food if you let me jump in with you.\" Guy is like, hell yeah, deal. \n\n\nSo, I jump in. The total is fucking astronomical cause bro ordered like 20+ burgers and some other stuff, but whatever, it is what it is. We pull off because he says he is headed back to a party and I'm welcome to tag along. He pulls out and zips right down to that aforementioned frat house. Internally I'm bummed because I generally dislike frat culture. I grew up poor, and they are typically a bunch of douchy rich kids, but what the hell, I can swallow my pride and enjoy a good party.\n\n\nNo sooner than we stop and the truck is swarmed by 10-15 fratastical dude who yank us out of the truck and have me pinned to the ground about to beat the shit out of me for stealing the truck. I hear driver guy screaming on the other side. \n\n\nIn the commotion I'm able to vaguely put together what happened through all the yelling. Driver guy was an underclassmen who decided to leave the party to go get food. He didnt have a car at the first house, so he just grabbed the first set of keys he could find, walked out, hit the unlock button a few times and took the truck thinking he would be back quickly and no one would notice, and he was going to grab food for everyone so they would actually be thankful.\n\n\n\nAfter some explaining that I just jumped in the truck at the drive through and unknowingly paid for all of their late night food, they let me go. Seemed like there was going to be some ongoing drama with truck thief, so I bounced, but it was definitely a memorable night.",

It seems to have been disbanded in 2019.  \n\nBut there isn't a lot of activity on their pages. \n\nFrankly, their status isn't real clear based on the web.",

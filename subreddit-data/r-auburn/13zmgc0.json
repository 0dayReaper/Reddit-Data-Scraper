            "comment": "Lots of good places in Auburn and Opelika. It depends on the age, vibe you\u2019re looking for. Opelika is generally older but lots of young people are heading there because it\u2019s easy to park and not as crazy. Downtown Opelika has bars, breweries and a distillery. All are great. You can simply walk around and check the places out. They are literally next to each other. \n\nDowntown Auburn has the usual college bars like Sky and Southeast. There\u2019s some upscale places like the bar in the Auburn hotel. Again, you can walk around downtown and hit most but they\u2019re a bit more spread out in Auburn. Not a big deal but you\u2019ll get some more steps in than Opelika. \n\nBe safe. Walk or ride share. Enjoy yourself. Welcome to Auburn!",

Sadly they may turn you away if you\u2019re under 21(usual age is 19 to get in for students) and I\u2019ve heard that people with foreign IDs get turned down too. In all honesty though, Skybar is the bar every other bar wishes to be.",

    "postText": "Currently looking at apartments from Northcutt and First Realty. Anything $800 and/or lower for 1 bed. I currently work full time at Walmart so with the cheaper apartments I see for $450-$500 I should have no problem making 3x the rent. I see they\u2019re listed available for Fall 23 so should I start applying now?\n\nEdit: Thanks guys for the suggestions and advice. I will definitely take a look into all of them and start the application process. My main worry was just having all the spots taken up but I think I should be good",

            "comment": "I agree with tigersoreagles. Something priced as low as $500 would need to be looked at and confirmed it isn't for 1 bed in a 3-4 bed place and isn't falling apart. $800 is probably doable, but you'd want to start looking now.",

            "comment": "Northcutt has a lot of cheaper one bedroom complexes. I would definitely tour before signing a lease though. From my experience, northcutt takes good care of their properties, but some are on the older side or have odd layouts. START LOOKING NOW WITY NORTHCUTT!! They already have some apartments filled up. Stuff goes quick \n\nI think you could easily find something under 800 and even closer to the 400-600 range. The big difference from larger apartment complexes will be that you aren\u2019t going to have any sort of \u201csecure\u201d parking(no closed parking decks or things like that) and usually, anyone can walk straight up to your apartment door without any sort of buzzer system. There isn\u2019t a lot of crazy crime in Auburn, so that\u2019s not really a big deal, but is still something to consider if that bothers you.",

There wasn\u2019t anything I saw on Northcutt\u2019s website that allowed me to put in a application for a unit so I assume I got to do that in person. I was just worried I\u2019d be too late and everything would be filled up",

You\u2019d have to either go to your friends or coin laundry. They also seemed to have very thin walls\u2026 \nOne good thing about Dexter and Neil were that I didn\u2019t have to pay for water but I\u2019d take washer and dryer in my unit over not paying water any day lol\n\nOak Manor (the one next to Neil House) is a single room with $631 a month and comes with both washer and dryer. They go out pretty quickly. \n\nRealties tend to figure out who\u2019s going to continue their lease for next year or not around this time of the year to figure out how many units will be empty for next year. I remember resigning my lease around January with Northcutt. Then, they fill the remaining ones throughout the remainder of spring semester. Lots of high school graduates come to Auburn during their spring break to sign their lease so by the end of March, most of decent units are out. So, I think you\u2019d be fine if you start looking and touring now.",

But it is possible the name changed more than once and then back to the older name I knew.   \n\nThe other place we used to go was Sani-Freeze which we called Sani-Flush. It was across town on East Glenn.  It was a small building that had a walk-up service window. It was the go-to place when your bank account was low.",

Occasionally,  a few of us would hookup @ Denaros restaurant downtown for a few drops and smooth sounds coming from the stage. War Eagle Supper Club was a whole different animal, many good memories!\nWDE!",

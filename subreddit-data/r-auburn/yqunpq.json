            "comment": "I used to be Auburn faculty \u2014 here\u2019s a tip they may not have told you:\n\nIf you don\u2019t manage to get off the waitlist before the semester starts, check the seats in the class during the add/drop period in the beginning of the semester. \n\nOnce the first day of the new semester hits, they cancel that waitlist. So if you were 4th on that waitlist you just need to check and see if someone has dropped their seat and you should be able to enroll. It\u2019s very \u201cHunger Games\u201d but some of my former students managed to slip into a class this way.\n\nEdit to add: you may be able to talk to a department chair about this too, but it should be your last resort. If you need this class to graduate and it\u2019s not going to be offered again before your planned graduation date they may allow you to overload the class if the professor signs off on it.\n\nAnother edit: I wouldn\u2019t recommend asking the professor if you can be added over the student cap. Depending on the department, they have to get the chair\u2019s approval first anyway.",

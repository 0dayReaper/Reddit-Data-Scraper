    "postText": "Hey, y\u2019all!  Arkansas fan here coming in peace.  I live a lot closer to Auburn than I do Fayetteville, and our two gymnastics teams are having a meet this Friday in Auburn.  I\u2019d love to take my gymnastics-obsessed young daughter to her first SEC meet, but I\u2019m clueless as to where would be the best place for us to sit, etc.  \n\nI know reserved seating is all sold out, and I\u2019m willing to spend some money on the secondary market, but I was hoping some veteran Auburn gymnastics supporters may be able to help me out with good sections to look for seats in where more visiting fans may be sitting.  Don\u2019t wanna offend anybody by wearing too much cardinal in their immediate presence! \n\nThanks in advance for any help!  I appreciate y\u2019all!",

We\u2019re facing the bars and beam, but right in front of the best pretzels in the arena, chick fil a, and bathrooms. We love our seats, but if you\u2019re wanting to see the floor we\u2019re a little ways away. If you get standing room only you can walk and follow the action though. Those seem to be the most affordable option right now.",

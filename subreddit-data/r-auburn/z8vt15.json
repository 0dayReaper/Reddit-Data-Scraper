A Dean sexually harassed a student and was paid a six figure bonus after being found guilty. The Title 9 office investigated less than 5% of complaints. That makes that campus a playground for someone with Freeze\u2019s history.",

I had to have the tag removed.\n\nI have an Auburn alumni credit card.  I can no longer use it when others are around.\n\nI fully expect others to have to back off their support of Auburn as well.  Business is just too competitive to alienate customers just by your mere association with Auburn.\n\n(Edit - typo)",

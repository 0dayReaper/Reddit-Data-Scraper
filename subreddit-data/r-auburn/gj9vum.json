The people that oppose Professor Goldberg subconsciously feel that he hates us, and I'm just explaining to them WHY he hates us.\n\nEven I'd agree there are some horrible injustices in prisons. The point is, he didn't call for prison reform. He calls openly for the complete abolition of prisons, period. Until he lives in a community of ex-cons and is fully exposed to the consequences of prison abolition, I'd say he's a hypocrite.

I just like blowing up narratives. Also said Lying is possible*, acting in bad faith, troll. But sorry I got carried away with some thoughts on all of that. \n\nIf I wanted to get into what their whole \u201cwar\u201d thing I\u2019d definitely disagree with his methods. He\u2019s falling into the pitfall of giving war a negative connotation. Pretty short sighted to live in a world where everything is evil or good. I\u2019d point him to Camp Warrior and the teachings of the warrior spirit, warrior ethics and warrior soul. \n\nShit we should just tell him to go watch The Men who Stare at Goats. Or maybe read about Rick Rescorla and why Eagle is so important. \n\nPlus you rite. War Eagle isn\u2019t just a symbol of our origins and history but a symbol of this nation. It\u2019s just fucking cool and not some quasi attempt at subliminal linguistic manipulation. \n\nIn short I love War Eagle",

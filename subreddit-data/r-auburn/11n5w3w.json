    "postText": "I vaguely remember going to a few parties at Auburn in the early 90's.  My friend had a house next to a gas station and we would roll over to the gas station to pick up half gallon milk jugs of cheap beer.  So much easier than having a keg!  Odd to see folks wandering around drinking out of milk jugs. \n\nThey also sold beer in full gallon if you were feeling adventurous.   All this BORG news reminded me.\n\nFriend says it was on corner of Glenn and College, now there is a Waffle House...\n\nAny other old-timers remember similar shenanigans in AL?  I heard years ago they did not refill glass growlers of craft beer, only new plastic jugs.",

I don't remember buying any beer like that in Auburn.  \n\nIn the winter of '83 when we had a snowstorm and classes were cancelled, I remember waiting in the grocery store (A&amp;P?) with the line all the way to the back of the store with students buying beer.  We always bought Schaefer, it was like $2.20 for a six pack...",

During the 80s and '90s, which is the era we are discussing the only place to get it around. There was the cold keg off the interstate by the racetrack. Macon county made draft beer legal due to the racetrack. Montgomery county and Lee county both had laws against draft beer. The only place in Montgomery county that you could buy a keg of beer at for personal use was that a class 6 on the military bases",

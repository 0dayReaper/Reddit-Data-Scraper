    "postText": "Posting this on the drama that I have been seeing among my friends and looking for thoughts! Real story and names changed for privacy!  \n\n\nSara and Theo started dating. Theo asked for Sara to be her girlfriend and she agreed! It was quick based on 1 or 2 dates. Theo introduced her to the family and friends. Within a couple of weeks Theo said he loves Sara and asked Sara to move in.   \n\n\nContext - Sara has been living alone for a while Theo still lives with his parents. Theo is looking for Sara to help him move and settle!  \n\n\nSara broke up with Theo because she felt she was being used by Theo to elevate his social status. He was unresponsive on texts and calls and Sara felt she was being taken for granted. She missed the spark she had felt earlier with him. Theo started crying upon breakup and was shocked. He thought this was love when Sara said she felt it was more attraction than love.  \n\n\nContext - Sara has been in love and one serious relationship. Theo has been in one-sided relationships where he usually worships/idolizes women in position of authority.\n\nAfter the breakup, they talked, and Theo admitted he was jealous of Sara and dismissive. Sara listened and agreed to be friends.  \n\n\nAnd now - Theo checks in with Sara about her day daily. Theo replies to messages immediately and Theo is looking for ways to spend time with Sara. Sara is annoyed with this behavior. She feels that if he could have done all this earlier, why didn't he do it? And why is he doing it now?  \n\n\nWhat do you think Sara and Theo should do?",

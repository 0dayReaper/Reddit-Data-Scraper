    "postText": "Hey everyone. I recently received a GTA offer for $1500 (doing engineering) for the fall semester for my first semester. I can\u2019t lie it seems like a really low number. I want to know what students typically get? I\u2019ve heard $1800 and even more at times. \n\nThanks \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udfff",

Typical stipend is 18k or 24k for masters or PhD respectively.\n\nSo labs have enough funding to pay slightly more than this for Master\u2019s or PhD, but this is the typical stipend. Yeah, the pay is low compared to other schools but so far, I\u2019ve had a good experience here.",

I however don\u2019t think you\u2019d get any more if you are already getting the typical pay. Also, you kinda don\u2019t want to give the impression that the money is what\u2019s important to you (even tho it\u2019s pretty important \ud83d\ude05). Good luck!",

            "comment": "$1500 is the minimum to get tuition waived for College of Engineering. Usually TA salary is from the department and they won\u2019t pay more than minimum. Students with higher salary do research for professors, so you may wanna look for professors to work with and see how much they are willing to pay. Most people I know are around 22K to 25K\u2026\n\nIt is pretty low compared to other schools, but still better than some non-engineering departments on campus.",

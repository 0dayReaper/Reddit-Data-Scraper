I know it sounds crazy, but apparently there's a large swinger club in surrounding neighborhoods.\n\nAside from that, you could try dating apps, FetLife, or just go to nicer bars in Auburn and Opelika and start meeting folks.\n\nI was friends with two different couples in Auburn who were poly and they never seemed to have trouble meeting people, but I never asked em their techniques lol. Good luck!",

I can\u2019t think of what it\u2019s called? But the info is from a fairly reliable source",

I also have a 25 super score on my act so I was wonder what my odds are for actually getting accepted after my application was deferred.\n I also have a few friends with lower gpa\u2019s and act scores who still got accepted so I\u2019m wondering why I got deferred and they didn\u2019t.",

Average act for in state early action admits 2023 was 27 and for out of state was 29.9. As an out of state family surrounded by great students who were deferred can confirm everyone I know with less than a 29 on act was either deferred or denied.",

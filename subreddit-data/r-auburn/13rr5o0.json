            "comment": "Amsterdam is a favorite of mine. I recommend going during lunch during the week or brunch on the weekend as the prices are MUCH better. Draft House is a good sports bar type place with pretty good food. Little Italy or Mellow Mushroom for pizza downtown if you don't wanna go the generic chain route. (Yes I realize these are chains as well, but they are a step above Dominos, Pappa Johns etc.) Hamilton's Downtown, once again, prices are much better at lunch. Sadly most of the areas mom and pop BBQ places that were so good are all gone now leaving us with mostly overpriced chains for that kinda stuff.  The hound is pretty good but starts getting a little more expensive. As others have said places like The Depot and Acre are great, but they really start getting into the pricier options.",

For the more expensive places, Tiger VR Caf\u00e9, Bow and Arrow, The Depot, The Hound, Draft House, and Irritable Bao\nEdit, forgot to add Little Italy's Pizza. There's a ton of places to eat downtown",

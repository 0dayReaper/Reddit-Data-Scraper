            "comment": "I am a business analytics major in my last semester so I think I can help. ISMN-5650 (application development with emerging technologies) revolves around Python coding using Jupyter Notebook. You discuss anything from introduction to variable types to more complex for loops and even password hashing. ISMN-3830 (database management systems) is SQL less coding but more focus on querying data and database architecture (setting up databases from scratch). A very new one that I won\u2019t have the chance to take is is ISMN-3080 (programming and computer applications) the description is: \u201c visual and object-oriented business programming languages are introduced and explored.\u201d Sounds interesting.",

                            "comment": "They are very similar. I could switch in my last semester and would probably have less than a semesters work to graduate as a MIS if I wanted. (Meaning you take almost all the same classes.) However, I will do my best to accurately differentiate the two. I would say that MIS is more computer based. If you wanted to be a programmer or someone who sets up databases and ERD\u2019s (entity relationship diagrams) then MIS is probably the way to go. Again im not MIS so don\u2019t take this to be the most accurate description you can get. \n\nBusiness analytics as a theme is about bridging the gap between those business people who aren\u2019t technical and the computer scientists. As a BUAL major you have to be able to understand the business and the technical side. Also, BUAL is, I would argue, slightly more math heavy. All business majors have to take business analytics 1&amp;2. According to Michael Lamb Both those classes several years ago were statistics 1&amp;2 and they just changed the name to business analytics 1&amp;2. So there is no business in that class. It is all statistics. If data science is something that interests you, or building models in Python that predict things like maybe predicting a March madness winner. Or predicting what patients will get diabetes based off certain variables, then BUAL is the route to go. \n\nIt should be noted that they do a good job of letting you kinda merge the two. In my curriculum when they required I take a BUAL elective, almost all ISMN electives count for those and vice versa. So for example, this semester I needed to take 2 BUAL electives. The two I chose were ISMN 5650 and ISMN 4090. So you can merge classes and do what interests you. Also i don\u2019t know if you are a freshman or what, but I WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMEND you take ISMN 5650 before predictive modeling 2. It would probably help for predictive modeling 1 too but certainly for pred modeling 2. Why? Because you do a lot of data science using Python in predictive modeling 2. It is way more difficult to understand and build predictive models in Python code\u2026 if you don\u2019t know the basics of Python. However, it\u2019s doable to take predictive modeling 1&amp;2 before ISMN 5650. I did. In BUAL you also learn to use data visualization tools like Tableau to create stories and easy on the eye presentations that give the data a \u201cstory\u201d to again, those who can\u2019t understand large complex datasets. \n\nSome jobs I\u2019m applying to rn are: Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Business Intelligence, Data Scientist (data science is hard to get if you don\u2019t have a masters in data science)\n\nI\u2019m happy to answer any other questions you have!",

That being said we do fill it up in good years very well, but the demand for necessarily more seating is questionable as well. I think a more realistic option is more premium seating and almost completely redoing the north end zone. That was the official proposed design a few years ago, but never completely went through. We may expand slightly in the future, but probably not expansion as much as quality.",

    "postText": "Are there any boxing gyms in the area that have train boxers to actually compete? I know of 9rounds and other gyms that are like workout style boxing classes, but I'm looking for a gym that actually trains boxers. It doesn't have to be in Auburn, I'd say anywhere within a 30 minute driving radius.\n\nThank you in advance",

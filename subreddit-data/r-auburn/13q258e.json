Without assistance this week, great number of dogs are going to be put down within a week. \n\nScroll down and click on \"Code Red\"\nhttps://www.leecountyhumane.org/\n\n\n\ud83e\udee3\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\udc15\ud83e\uddae\ud83d\udc29\ud83d\udc15\u200d\ud83e\uddba\ud83d\udc3e\ud83e\uddb4\ud83d\udc36\n\n\n\"CODE RED EMERGENCY: Our Shelter is Bursting at the Seams! \ud83d\udd34\n\nWe need to have an honest and open discussion about the critical situation we are facing. Our shelter is operating at a staggering 230% capacity, and the influx of dogs is overwhelming our resources. We simply can't handle the number of dogs coming in, and it's putting the animals' futures at stake.\n\n\ud83d\udc94 We don't like to talk about it, but the reality is that some of these precious animals are at risk. Our last resort option is euthanasia, and it breaks our hearts to even consider it. That's why we are reaching out to you, our compassionate community, to step up and help us save lives.\n\nIn an effort to find immediate solutions, we are making a bold move. All dogs weighing 40lbs and greater are now available for FREE adoption. Our primary goal is to find loving homes where these dogs can flourish and be cherished members of a family.\n\nHowever, if a dog is not yet altered, we kindly request a $50 deposit. This deposit will go directly towards covering the cost of the spay/neuter surgery, ensuring responsible pet ownership and preventing future overpopulation.\n\n\ud83c\udfe0 We urgently need adopters and foster families to come forward. By providing a loving home, even temporarily through fostering, you can make an incredible difference in these dogs' lives.\n\nWe understand that losing a beloved pet can be a heartbreaking experience. In an effort to reunite families, we are waiving all claim fees for lost dogs currently at our shelter. If your lost dog is here, there won't be any fees to reclaim them. Come and get them reunited with open arms.\n\nWe want to be transparent and share the reality of the situation. The well-being of these animals is in our hands, and we can't do it alone. Your support through adoption, fostering, or even spreading the word about our plight is crucial.\n\nPlease, share this message far and wide, so we can reach potential adopters, foster families, and those looking to reclaim their lost pets. Together, we can make a difference and ensure a brighter future for these beautiful souls.\"",

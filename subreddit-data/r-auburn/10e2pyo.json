    "postText": "hi, I\u2019m an incoming freshman. I\u2019ve seen around that on-campus housing spots are limited, and so it\u2019s best to put in the housing application right away, and to my understanding, you have to put down the enrollment fee before you can. However, I\u2019m still not completely set on going to Auburn, I\u2019m waiting to hear back from another school. As an out-of-state student, I\u2019m worried about not being able to get a dorm. Should I put down the enrollment deposit and back out of it later if need be? how long should I wait? Thanks",

Plus you get your own room, a kitchen, pool access, parking right outside instead of a mile away, don't have to move your car for football games, etc. I had friends in creekside that split a 6br together and it was like $400/mo each.",

All the new ones downtown were just being built when I left, so no idea there, but I've heard they're very pricy and put together poorly-its all just location. There were some decent apartments on the NW side behind old row-the grove, Logan square, edge west... No idea if that's still their names but all were walkable (or easy bus ride) to campus. I'd avoid anything off south college unless money is really an issue-used to be ok 15 years ago, but lately a lot of non-students have moved in for the low cost and tends to be where you hear the trouble happens. Places by momma GS are solid- older buildings but built to last, just have to deal with the train. Not sure about the east edge of campus anymore",

There is a $100 non refundable fee that you pay within this application. The enrollment fee does not need to be paid until 48 hours before you SELECT a room. So, you can fill out the housing application now even though you\u2019re not sure where you\u2019re going. I recommend doing this in case you do decide to come here as time slots are given based off of when you applied for housing.",

Even though housing is completely full at this time, the office gets cancellations throughout the time of room selection and they add those rooms back to the portal. If you check during the day, you may be able to snag one from a cancellation. Also, after room selection, cancellations still come in and the office manually places students who weren\u2019t able to initially select a room into those open rooms from cancellations so there is still a high chance of you getting a space. As far as living off campus, I loved 221 Armstrong, 320 west mag is popular as well as the standard and uncommon, edge west, the grove, and other smaller communities around campus. I would read reviews on wherever you\u2019re looking though!",

            "comment": "So, I didn't get into Marine Biology but I am an alumnus. The only advice I have to give really is to go into something that you actively enjoy in your average life. If scuba diving with sea creatures and studying their behavior is something that brings you joy, then this may be a good path for you. From what I've seen, the field work seems very rewarding for this field.\n\nI got a software engineering degree because I've always been interested in computers and am a pretty avid gamer. Maybe game dev would have felt more rewarding. I've been in the field for four years now and the pay is good but I do not enjoy it in the slightest. The time I have for fun activities, taking care of average adult tasks like going to the doctor, and spending time with family is horrendously low. I regret entering this field, even if I am good at my job. I've been considering going back to school at some point in the future to get into something that will allow me more free time that doesn't require \"extra-curricular\" work that I don't get paid for during my \"free time.\" I want to leave work at work and live my life when I'm not there.\n\nMental health is more important than wealth. Maybe the pay I'm getting will help me retire faster since I have the flexibility to invest quite a bit in ETFs and Dividend stocks, but it's still going to take a long long time for me to get to the point where I can live entirely off of dividends, and in the meantime I am miserable.",

I just want to make sure auburn is decent enough at marine biology",

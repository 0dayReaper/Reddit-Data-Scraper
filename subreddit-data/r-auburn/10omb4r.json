I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary, I get a calzone at mellow mushroom every so often, it cooks like any food and it goes into one box. Not complicated and it\u2019s already expensive. \n\nAgree or disagree? I\u2019m honestly just tired of the tipping culture in the US, I tip well if I\u2019m being served but $13 for a calzone, they can pay their people an hourly rate if someone is doing to go orders.",

It typically adds $20-$80 additional wages for each person on each shift (4-8 ppl). \n\ncustomers order your own food. sit themselves. go get their own food at the counter. throw their own trash away. but each day we end with $125-$500 in tips (total, to be split by the staff.)\n\nedit: they are GREATLY appreciated, as wages aren\u2019t high for college jobs. it just surprises me is all.",

If the same person came in a couple times and tipped, we would remember and be extra careful about getting their order right, made quickly (and maybe even throw some extra in there). That being said, we also thought the food prices were ridiculous and really never did expect people to tip.\n\nSo I would say, if you throw in an extra buck or two for carry out, you might make someone\u2019s work day better. Dont tip and you\u2019re just blending in, no one\u2019s going to hold it against you.",

You cannot expect the customer to pay your staff directly for the service they provide. \n\nAsking a customer to tip sounds like this to me: \" Hey thanks for supporting my business, I am glad you enjoyed your meal. Can you throw in a little extra for my employee, I'd like to be able to pay them an honest wage like every other business does but, I'd rather have you pay them for me.",

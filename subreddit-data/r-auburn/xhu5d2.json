    "postText": "Penn State student here, me and my buddies drove down from State College. I\u2019ve gone to 4 road games (Pitt, Maryland, OSU, and now Auburn) and y\u2019all were the best by a landslide. Toomer\u2019s lemonade &gt;&gt;&gt;, (our whole group bought t-shirts, hats, and/or mugs from Toomer\u2019s too), everyone was so hospitable, the War Eagle was so freaking cool!!!, you were louder than OSU with 20k less capacity, and your campus is absolutely beautiful. Thank you for being amazing hosts, hoping to come back as an Auburn fan for an Iron Bowl! Beat Bama and War Eagle!\n\nAlso having cell service in the stadium was so foreign to me\n\nEdit: Got back to State College safely at 2 AM!!",

I always feel bad for out of state fans that come to watch their team and get stomped, so I\u2019m actually really happy that the Penn State roadies got a good show. Every PSU fan we met on Friday and Saturday were so nice and all seemed genuinely surprised by how well they were received in town. It makes me so proud to be an Auburn fan and resident.

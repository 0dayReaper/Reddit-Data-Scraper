If you are interested in a carrier in DS, then I would make sure whatever program you have you take courses that cover natural language processing, computer vision, and some optimization courses. There are a lot of \u201cdata science\u201d jobs that are really just data engineering or business analyst positions, those don\u2019t pay as well. All of this to say that you should be proficient in Python and working in a Linux environment too. These skills will make you much more marketable. We don\u2019t care your degree, we care about your skills as a programmer and your ability to understand how your ML models will integrate and benefit the organization.",

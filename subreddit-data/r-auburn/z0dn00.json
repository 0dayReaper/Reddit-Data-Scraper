I even called IT and they said it was a relatively common issue and they were working on fixing it. It seems to be a server-side issue with win 11 for whatever reason.\n\nFor what it's worth, when I registered this semester, it worked on my win 11, so idk what they did, but it was fixed for me.\n\nFor you, I'd try to use a win 10 device, or maybe borrow a Mac or another win 11 and try that.\n\nIf all else fails, you might be able to do it on your phone, but I've heard mixed reports from people who tried that.\n\nEdit: you could also try using incognito and doing it a a public library if needs must",

    "postText": "I just wanted to open a discussion about how the city as a whole and also the university completely oversees the most basic urban mobility. It's basically: if don't own a car, depending on where you live, you're screwed. No one seems to care/talk about it, and the city basically dies even more in the summer, when not even tiger transit is around... So if you're a GRA, GTA and even an undergrad taking in-person classes in the summer, there's no alternative for you. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

I would like to hear what are y\u2019alls experience and how is it going. Is the University really difficult? And how good is the engineering department in general and in aerospace?\n\nI might be asking a lot but I\u2019m literally scarred for life cuz I feel like I went with the wrong university for aerospace engineering :\u2019(",

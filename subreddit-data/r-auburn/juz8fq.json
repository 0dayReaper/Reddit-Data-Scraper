In no way has it been like what I expected for my freshman year as far as class modalities and socializing go.\n\nGiven that, do you think that there could be more to the problem of low grades than the lack of pass/fail options? What might we be able to do to solve it?",

I was diagnosed with depression over quarantine, online classes didn\u2019t offer any structure that I would\u2019ve gotten from a normal semester and I rely on structure. Lack of socialization also plays a huge role, I like to make friends in my classes and start studying with them but that has been damn near impossible this semester because I am too shy to pop up in a groupme and ask for help studying.\n\nI\u2019m right there with you, I transferred here last semester. My Auburn experience has so far been utter shit. A lot of the time, I regret transferring.",

[Mental health during quarantine has taken a plunge for a lot of people,](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932a1.htm?s_cid=mm6932a1_w) and it seems to me like there might be a correlation between those issues and lower grades. I wonder if that would be worth bringing to a dean officially. I saw a petition floating around on this sub for something of the sorts.",

I agree with you, they should make everyone take a covid-19 test before going home and before coming back, but they can't enforce a quarantine. They also know they can't keep people away from family over xmas, but they can prevent all the students from going down to Panama Beach for spring break. \n\nThings are going to get really bad over the winter though,  prepare.",

It makes perfect sense and is going to have a beneficial effect, but it's a feel bad situation because they already did not adequately address covid on campus. Also, losing spring break (during which I did not plan to travel anyway) is obnoxious. That said, the meme is mostly just a humorous complaint because I realize canceling spring break is technically in everyone's best interest (because people already pretend covid doesn't exist and would spread it more). But I do wonder why they decided to draw the line in the sand at spring break 2021.",

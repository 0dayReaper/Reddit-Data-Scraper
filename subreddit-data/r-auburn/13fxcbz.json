I\u2019ve been to counseling at my previous school but don\u2019t know how to obtain the letter for housing on campus. Do they accept the online certifications? Just wondering. Any help would be appreciated",

For example ESAs do not have the right to go into restaurants, businesses, etc. However, federally all living quarters, including college campuses must allow for ESAs to stay with their residents and applicants cannot be turned down because of ESAs. Additionally, ESAs are exempt from deposits and fees. So yes, AU would be required to allow an ESA to stay with you. Online certifications ARE valid, though commonly abused to the frustration of those who have trained ESAs and actual diagnoses. I say this because a buddy of mine wanted to fly his dog and got an ESA after paying some fee without ever speaking with a doctor.",

My problem is I can easily get a diagnosis of PTSD/anxiety related to an event that\u2019s somewhat recent, but that I\u2019m in between providers since I am going to a new school and previously used a counselor at my other university. I don\u2019t want to get the letter just to conveniently have my animal with me, but I fear that\u2019s what any provider will see if they hear that I am looking for the letter. I just didn\u2019t know if Auburn accepted the online letters since that would be my most convenient way to get the ball rolling given the circumstances. I\u2019ll take any advice on this though since I do not want to abuse the concept of an ESA for convenience sake since I understand they are quite often misunderstood and misused. My previous provider cannot provide the documentation and I just don\u2019t know how to do it the right way to get it done on time.",

However, the one semester I was down bad and really needed him to mellow me out, all my professors made a deal with me: dog doesn't disrupt class, he can come, but not on test days. Was fine by  me. \n\n\ntl;dr: No to ESA, however, talk to your professors, explain the situation. Worse they can say is no. \n\n\nEdit: I think I noticed you were asking about dorms. I'm not sure about those. But, I didn't have to pay for my esa off campus, so there was that",

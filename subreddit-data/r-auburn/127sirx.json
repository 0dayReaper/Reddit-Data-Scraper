He would have been behind Five Guys. From there, he would have climbed a wall that is about 5\u2019 tall with a drop to the alley behind skybar being about 10\u2019. So he fell 10\u2019 and hit his head on the opposite wall of the alley. The cops told me it\u2019s not the first time someone has done it, just the first time someone died from it. They figured it out by looking at the camera behind five guys.",

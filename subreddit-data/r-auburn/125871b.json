    "postText": "Can someone give me a quick rundown of how course registration works? Do you just add each class individually and \"build\" a schedule, or can you put in all the courses you want and it gives you schedule options based on what's available?   \nIs there a strategy to getting popular classes/times? I have heard Coursicle is helpful to find spots that open up. \n\nAny other tips? Thanks",

Make sure you make a few different schedules with backups in case one of your classes is full\n\nWhen your registration time ticket opens, go to Add/Drop in AUAccess. You can enter in all your CRNs and then click a button that I think says \u201csubmit\u201d You are now signed up for your classes\n\nA tip that I\u2019ve learned is that if u do ur tiger scheduler way in advance and have a later registration slot, your classes will fill up and you\u2019ll spent weeks leading up to registration worrying about your schedule falling apart as classes fill up. If you go into tiger scheduler like 30-45 minutes before your registration time slot, everyone who has registration before you should have signed up, and you can finalize a pretty safe schedule for when you do register\n\nDOING TIGER SCHEDULER DOES NOT REGISTER YOU FOR THE CLASSES. It is just for planning purposes",

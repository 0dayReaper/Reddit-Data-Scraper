    "postText": "Hello. I am applying to ECE/CS PhD programs this fall (to start in fall 2024) and a professor I know recommended Auburn University. My research focuses are deep learning architecture design and AI for automotive/mobility applications. I wanted to see if any current students could provide some insight on the University that can\u2019t be easily found on the website. Thanks!",

Most of the responsibility will be on yourself to pick your focus and project/thesis and get it done.  Dr. Lim was great in this aspect and gave me plenty of freedom to pursue what I wanted.",

Cost of living is higher than other areas in Birmingham, but you can find a spot in town to live that can suit almost anyone. I lived on the quieter side (towards the vet school), and really enjoyed that. It's somehow both a lovely family town and a very active college town with all the perks that come with that. Downsides: to do anything truly interesting, you'll need to drive out to places like Atlanta, Birmingham, or south to the beach.",

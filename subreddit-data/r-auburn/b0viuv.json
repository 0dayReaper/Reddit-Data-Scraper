As a second semester junior I already can't wait to move(to be fair I've lived here since I was much younger as well). \n\nNobody *wants* to live hear really besides the professors and the students. Everyone else is stuck just performing their shitty jobs and, deep down at least, they hate it and can feel their existence being degraded. I don't blame them tbh. \n\n/Rant over. ",

That fits into my original comment that the only people who really want to live here are academics and students.\n\nIn my experience living here, most people that aren't associated with the university or are very wealthy are not very happy here and want to get out but lack the capacity to do so for whatever reason. It's pretty sad honestly, a lot of people I know from high school ended up just working jobs they don't like in Auburn wishing they could move away.\n\nEdit: basically, if you don't have a personal attachment to the university(due to long term, gainful employment in a prestigious tenured position or status as an alumni) you don't want to *end up* in Auburn Alabama. Everyone here is just compromising(maybe partially for good education for kids like you say) for employment and not living where they really want to be.",

What or who was robbed doesn't matter.\n\nBut yeah, these things are clearly meant to be very general warnings and not full news reports. I'm not a fan of getting four emails a text and a phone call either.\n\nLast semester there was a suspected gas leak that caused the evacuation of ~~several~~ a few buildings but there was never an alert for that either.",

Did he start at the museum and run towards south Donahue? Did he start at the smoothie King? Was he all the way down by 85? \n\nIt was a very vague message.

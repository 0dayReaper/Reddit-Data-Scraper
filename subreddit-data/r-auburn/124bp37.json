Three of us are attending the Honors college, but the fourth person isn\u2019t.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My questions are: will the housing website allow us to apply for Matthews Hall (Honors village) or will it decline the request since one member of our group is not in the Honors college and is there any way to get a non-honors student to room at an honors dorm?\n\nI hope you intend to take Honors English while you are here..\n\nTo answer your question though, no, all students in the Honors Dorm must be enrolled as Honors students. You will either need to tell your friend to enroll, politely break the news to them and wish them the best, or find a different dorm to reside in.",

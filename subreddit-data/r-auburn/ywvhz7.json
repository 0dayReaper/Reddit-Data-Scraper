Depending on what grade you're shooting for, you may want to triage.\n\nThat being said, if you're shooting for perfection, related rates, differentials, extreme value theorem, and definition of a derivative were the topics that were more challenging and you may want to spend more time in.\n\n\nI remember it being slightly weighted towards the later topics... So identifying the four types of indeterminate limits, L'Hospitals rule, and area under the curve were typically more heavily weighted.\n\nEdit: You can look up these specific topics on YouTube... There are some great lessons on there...  Just be careful that you're actually practicing and not just watching someone... If you were learning how to cook, you'd cook... Watching Food Network is great, but following along is even better.",

It's like Camp War Eagle on steroids and is invitation only.  \n\nThis Fall they are:\n\nFriday, October 21, 2022 (Ole Miss away game)  \nFriday, October 28, 2022 (Arkansas home game)  \nMonday, October 31, 2022\n\nI'd recommend the Oct 21 or Oct 31 dates, you would be more likely to find a hotel and parking.\n\nYou can email [wedadms@auburn.edu](mailto:wedadms@auburn.edu) for more info.",

So would they invite a student who's not going to be accepted? I've read somewhere that \"everyone\" who applied EA1 was invited, but I've heard of people who applied that didn't get an invitation. So who knows? It does seem to be directed at higher stats applicants possibly.",

    "postText": "Hi! I have a family emergency and have to leave Auburn University to go attend university in my home town, but my lease isn't up until July. It's a 1BR/1BA with no roommates. Plus, I cannot take the furniture with me so it will be yours to keep (minus the television). The rent is $1175, but December will be paid for (the month we need to someone to overtake the lease!). \n\nIf you are interested, please let me know.",

    "postText": "I'm looking at 1-bedroom apartments I can afford for the next lease year and it looks like Lemans Square is the only one that really fits my needs. From what I've read, I'd have to set up my own cable and internet provider in addition to post since the only utility included in the rent is water, and whatever unit I get isn't guaranteed to have a washer/dryer.\n\nI'm aware that this is probably gonna be a \"you get what you pay for\" type situation, but what experiences have y'all had living there?",

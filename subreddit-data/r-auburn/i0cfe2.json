It\u2019s going to be a lot online when it\u2019s appropriate. The school is testing all the students for Covid and I can guarantee that if enough test positive they\u2019ll make the semester all online. Assume any class will end up online right now, TBH. In theory we could contain it but as long as students go out to Skybar...we\u2019re gonna be all online soon. It takes a lot of effort to be all online and it\u2019s hard on faculty and staff so just accept it as it is and make the best of it. And put on your masks and stop going to the bars.",

Last year we tried to get rid of the football team all together to save $ in the budget but apparently that would impact the basketball team, as then we wouldn\u2019t be eligible for our conference (also a joke. I bet y\u2019all don\u2019t even know it exists).",

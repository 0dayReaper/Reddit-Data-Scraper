    "postText": "I\u2019m a graduate student looking for a 1 bedroom apartment for the fall semester. My graduation got pushed back to December and I have to move out of my current place at the end of July. I\u2019ve tried calling so many apartments, even in Opelika, and it seems no one does 6 month leases anymore. Does anyone know of any place that still does? Or does anyone know of someone trying to sublease for the fall semester? Feel free to message me. TIA",

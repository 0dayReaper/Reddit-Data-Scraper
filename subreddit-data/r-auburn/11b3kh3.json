I've heard a few things good and bad about Lemans/Chateau but tbh basically I'm trying to escape a hellish living situation rn and so my personal bar for \"awful\" is already set pretty low. So I was just curious if anybody who's lived there/lives there currently had any experiences to share. Thanks!\n\nEDIT: 1. Not interested in experiences from more than one year to present. 2. Not looking for opinions as to avoid/not avoid. Thanks for the helpful replies, y'all the real mvp!",

            "comment": "A couple of my friends and I live in different apartments here in Lemans, and honestly, none of us have had any bad experiences with the neighbors. The Chateau is a bit more unpredictable, honestly. Not really sure why, since the application pool is shared between complexes. \n\nHowever, I personally have had some issues with managemnet and not getting maintenance requests handled within what I would expect to be a timely manner. That's pretty much my only co.plaint about living here. \n\nRent is pretty much the cheapest you'll find in auburn, and you're relatively close to everything. Currently I live in a one bed-one bath apartment, with in unit washer/dryer, and pay 550 a month. My buddy lives in a 2 bed, 2bath (no washer/dryer), and pays 575.\n\nHope this helps!!",

The management, office staff, and maintenance changed damn near weekly. Meaning NOTHING ever got done. Last June when there was triple degree weather, they let me go THREE weeks with no air conditioning (not even a window unit until the day before they \u201cfixed\u201d my AC [that broke again within like 3 days]), I had roaches BAD and the pest control people would not spray my apartment bc I had a cat! Also, I personally had horrible neighbors. LOUD, inconsiderate, obnoxious, bad ass kids, etc. People cannot park for shit &amp; will hit your car. And there\u2019s also nails scattered throughout the parking lot along with TRASH (I shit you not, there\u2019s a toilet seat in one of the bushes since the day I moved in.. also seen underwear and a water bottle full of piss on the steps for weeks)!!! And that\u2019s just the highlights.. please.. just don\u2019t do it. My entire time there was not terrible but the longer I stayed, the worse it got, and the more the cons outweighed the pros.",

I never really had neighbor issues besides the random stomping above. the grounds could be maintained better but you get what you pay for. My biggest complain is the bugs/maintenance. They go through staff changes more often than I would like. Otherwise, it's not so bad once you realize how much you pay this close to downtown. if you have any specific questions, I may can answer some.",

My neighbors were cool and people looked out for one another. It\u2019s walking distance to restaurants and campus. We used the Leman\u2019s square pool regularly because Chateau\u2019s pool sucks and I dated a guy who lived in Leman\u2019s square. They are pretty comparable but Chateau is a much smaller place as it\u2019s only one building. \n\nAll in all, it wasn\u2019t bad. I lived there for 5 years with no major issue.",

All I\u2019ve heard about it from friends is that they have bugs and annoying management. It might be your best bet",

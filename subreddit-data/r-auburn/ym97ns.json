Now imagine if some other people considered that to be hate speech that shouldn\u2019t be allowed. Maybe even thought anyone promoting these ideas should be forcibly removed which is what you seemed to imply.

Inactive or threatening someone is where it becomes illegal. You mislabeling hate speech and then on top of that acting like its not free speech either is such a twisted up problem. Yelling bomb in an airport is not free speech, cuz its a threat and so even as a joke you cant do that. Fire is a different matter. If you yell fire that's a way to get attention, its not illegal and you're not threatening anyone and people can quickly see if its true or not without wasting time or anyone getting hurt.\n\nBasically none of this isn't free speech what those people are doing, hell its not even hate speech. Its just fearmongering which is a proven way to persuade people even if its not the best method",

I stopped the guy I knew and addressed him by name and he stared right past me and said \u201cthat\u2019s not me\u201d and kept walking.

IMO you\u2019re wasting your time and energy on something that people are going to make fun of you for. Forcing your religion on others is not polite by any means, although they may have the right to do it, it is still inconsiderate to those who don\u2019t like that sort of treatment which is beside the point. By all means do what you want, I served in the army for that. Just don\u2019t be surprised when people who don\u2019t believe in (and these are not my words but the words of those who don\u2019t like this) 1 of the many religions who claims to be the one. \n\nAt the end of the day let people have their opinions but as a famous book (how to win friends and influence people) once said, you can tell a person they are wrong, and they may know they are wrong but even so will hold tighter to their convictions / beliefs. You can\u2019t change people by telling them they are wrong so what does all of this mean?\n\nWell it means both people are in the wrong and both look stupid being unkind to their groups. Having pointless arguments about their convictions in which they think they are so right to the point of just being rude to each other.\n\nBe better and grow up. These people need to realize change is coming and it should be embraced. The kids should realize these people just want to get a ride out of people, don\u2019t let these people push your buttons.",

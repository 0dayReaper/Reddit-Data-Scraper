Its the only thing that sounds appetizing to me. I know this is probably impossible to answer but does anyone know what they put on it that makes it so addicting and delicious? I really want to recreate it \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

I tried to make a replication of it and it turned out alright, not exactly the same but it was still good. \n\nI just bought some ciabatta rolls from publix and toasted them just a little, cooked some normal chicken breasts and cut them into bite sized pieces, tossed in pesto and put on the bottom slice of ciabatta, put some havarti cheese on top and toasted it so the cheese melted, then I put spinach and tomato on top, salted and peppered the tomato and put mayo on the top pieces of ciabatta and bam, makeshift chicken pesto panini. \n\nSorry thats a bit long winded. Now I want to make one\u2026",

The chicken was marinated in a mixture of pickle juice and Italians dressing and soaked in the same thing after grilling and cutting",

Everyone knows or will know soon.\n\nThe main issue to me is that when we hired our Athletic Director, he stated publicly several times that he was the one that would make the hiring decision.  Auburn has a history of letting boosters make coaching hires.  Cohen and President Roberts put that possibility to rest repeatedly.  \n\nThis is Jimmy Rane's decision and Jimmy Rane's hire.\n\nCohen has personal knowledge of his compliance issue and he is the one who turned Freeze into the NCAA, so it defies logic that he would be the one to hire the man.\n\nAuburn is letting money men on the board of trustees make decisions for the University.",

He has publicly come out and said he cheated on his wife but she\u2019s forgiven him. Power to her. \n\nI am all for giving grace but I do not believe it is deserved when it comes to the privilege of being Auburn\u2019s head football coach. Furthermore, outside of him just saying that he has found forgiveness in Jesus, I have not seen any efforts from Freeze to take accountability for his actions and to try to grow, improve, and be deserving of grace and forgiveness. Just lip service. Liberty hired him to be their coach extremely quickly (maybe a day? I don\u2019t remember exactly) after he was no longer threatened with suspension. \n\nI do not know him, and I have said here and elsewhere that he may be a fine man. He appears to be remarkably charming and charismatic. But he has routinely bumbled and made mistakes that I believe he shouldn\u2019t be making, oftentimes to cover up other mistakes he has made. I am particular about saying inappropriate in regards to his DMs because as far as I can tell it\u2019s just stupid and not illegal. \n\nIn the most generous interpretation of events that he has been accused of, he has a habit of acting stupidly, emotionally, and immaturely while hiding behind his faith to avoid accountability. In the harshest of interpretations, he\u2019s a sexual predator or at least someone who enables sexual predators.\n\nI believe the truth is he falls somewhere in between, but either way I am extremely disappointed that he\u2019s being given the opportunity to coach collegiate football at the highest level. I truly believe if he hadn\u2019t beaten Bama in back to back seasons, he wouldn\u2019t even have been considered. But alas. He did and he was.",

Hell Pat Dye got caught...why aren't Auburn fans rioting in the streets to have his name removed from the field? Hypocrites much?\n\n People on Reddit just want to stand behind their keyboards and rant. People have the right to express their opinion, but to those \"fans\" abandoning the men that actually play because of the coach, bye. I won't miss you at all!",

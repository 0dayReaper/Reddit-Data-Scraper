    "postText": "Hi there! I\u2019m an Auburn MBA student and I wanted to post here to get the word out about a small business I\u2019ve recently launched, it\u2019s called granola girl world (you can find me on FB or IG under that name). Everything I make is fully gluten and dairy free. As someone with an allergy to both gluten and dairy I know how hard it is to find things around here that I\u2019m able to eat, which is why I started this business! I know ads aren\u2019t allowed so pls delete this if it\u2019s not ok, but I also just wanted to put a plug in for the O Grows farmers market. I\u2019ll be there (with granola, cookies, and protein bars) along with a bunch of other amazing vendors this weekend. It\u2019s a really fun way to spend your Saturday morning!",

Also, you may want to check with Dayspring to see if you\u2019d be interested in having some of your stuff in there to sell. I worked there for several years and local, gluten-free, dairy-free are prime products there. I think they take 10-20% of the sale, but you can always mark up the price and it\u2019s nice to have a place to drop off/just pick up checks if you\u2019re doing all the sale work yourself most of the time. Plus free marketing to lots of your target demographic",

Currently using honey but I\u2019m considering switching to maple syrup to accommodate vegan diets since I\u2019m already dairy and egg free From a quick google search it looks like maple syrup is low FODMAP!! The cookies and granola do contain some brown sugar as well though. But the protein bars could easily be low fodmap with maple syrup instead of honey!",

My husband developed his IBS after getting listeria poisoning. He cannot eat out anymore-almost everything he eats now is homemade. There are not a lot of prepared food options for folks who have IBS (from COVID or otherwise). So from a business perspective, there\u2019s low competition and a growing need. People who follow a low FODMAP diet struggle to specifically find energy bars, granolas, cereals, sweets of any kind, etc.\nLight brown sugar, maple syrup and plain corn syrup are okay in this diet. Dark brown sugar, honey and high fructose corn syrup are the problem sweeteners. Theres a lot to being certified as low FODMAP but it\u2019s definitely a need. Check out Monash University in Australia. They are the leading researchers in the diet.",

I\u2019ve definitely been trying to think of a way to differentiate since there are so many granola businesses out there! I\u2019m definitely going to look into this- thank you!!!",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve got a place to rent in auburn. It\u2019s pricy but brand new. 3/2 single family home with a small backyard. Not furnished but has brand new appliances. Perfect for a young professional, grad student, or small family.\n\nI\u2019ve posted it to Zillow but wondering if there is an Auburn specific place I could post it? Anyone have any website suggestions? Or if anyone here is interested, let me know. Thanks!",

Even if it\u2019s \u201cbrand new\u201d and in a good neighborhood, I will be surprised if you find somebody to rent it very quickly. I live in a 20 year old 3/3 that\u2019s about 1250 square feet for only $1250/month (lawn maintenance included). I highly doubt that new appliances and being in a \u201creally nice community\u201d makes the house worth almost twice as much as the one I live in. Good luck!",

Those real estate sites just give a lot of generic, usually outdated info. I think people want to be able to easily ask questions about the place they're interested in. Just my opinion. Good luck.",

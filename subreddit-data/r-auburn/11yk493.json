That's probably why your advisor recommended a different school. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. \n\nI'm sure there have to be a lot of options out there, especially online.",

Great teachers, small classes, cheap, and don\u2019t worry about the stigma of going to a community college most people at SUSCC are students at AU just trying to knock out harder classes or even save money. Check with your advisor before though bc some classes may not transfer (most do bc both schools have the same professors as well as their integration between schools)",

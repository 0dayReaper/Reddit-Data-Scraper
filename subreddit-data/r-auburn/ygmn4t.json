Have any of you been able to convince COE to allow you to do your internship somewhere closer to where you are from (still in the state)? I understand that they generall\\*y\\* will send students within a sixty-mile radius, but will they occasionally allow students to complete them outside of that range under certain circumstances? Thanks!",

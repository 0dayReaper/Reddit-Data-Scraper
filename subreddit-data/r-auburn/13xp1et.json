I\u2019m relatively recently graduated and a bit out of shape physically and technically, so the club team isn\u2019t an option. I\u2019m a 24 y/o male.",

I\u2019m sure they\u2019re who you\u2019re looking for.\n\nAlso, go to auburnalabama.org/soccer for the local rec league. \n\nEdit: added rec league link",

    "postText": "I am a current Purdue sophomore in mechanical engineering. I\u2019ve struggled a lot in ME for most of my time at Purdue and classes continue to get more difficult. I dropped below a 3.0 GPA this semester which is what I need for most of the internships I\u2019m trying to get. I am considering transferring to Auburn ME. How difficult is the program and what can I expect compared to Purdue?",

Auburn\u2019s undergrad program runs laps around GaTech\u2019s. I\u2019m short on specifics but the overall conclusion is that it is a very difficult degree here and if you\u2019re already struggling at Purdue I wouldn\u2019t come down here and expect anything different. Source: I\u2019m an AE that\u2019s close with a bunch of MEs. Also be sure to find out what credits Auburn will except from Purdue and look into Auburns CO-OP program.",

Their UG program for ME is ranked 2nd in the nation; their College of Engineering is ranked within the Top 5, and overall, the university is ranked within the Top 20 for public institutions.",

Auburn is a wonderful, amazing place, but it\u2019s a tough as hell school. ME is a hard discipline anywhere, but Auburn also has no problems railing students with grade deflation. That alone can make simple classes hell. I don\u2019t know what Purdue is like to compare the two directly though, so idk. \n\nAs far as internships, if you have other applicable skills, you can get one without a 3.0. I don\u2019t have close to a 3.0, but I got one this last summer because I have a boatload of 3D printing experience. Experience is experience, and an internship is just a couple months.",

Wasn\u2019t much of a fan of him, very rough around the edges didn\u2019t seem to want to reach just tell you you\u2019re dumb. Also bevly was similar he took a rough class and made it more difficult than necessary, he was not very approachable or helpful unless you planned on going to grad school and he recruited you to work in his lab. Bevly plays favorites and he missed more than half our classes to watch rc cars race in Indiana. Martin and rose were great I went to them mostly. I ended up passing with Allen he was new last year and totally awesome would take any class with him if I was still there.",

I think it was ragan for heat transfer he took a brutal class and made it very approachable had a better experience there than in most other difficult classes. Tons of homework problems mostly ungraded but the big thing is he provided solutions before tests to make sure you could learn. In a lot of classes I would get B and C on tests and straight F\u2019s on homework which would really hurt my overall grade. Never understood why so many profs never gave homework solutions that\u2019s how I learned much of what I know. If anyone in aerospace or other has the chance to take melnick he will always be the best teacher I\u2019ve had in my life I can\u2019t recommend him enough.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI will be starting in the spring on my BSBA degree in 2023. Has anyone here taken it? What should I expect? \n\nBasically I am looking for any experiences, good or bad, on this. Especially course recommendations or even teachers! I am finishing up at Jeff State, so online work is not a problem. \n\nThanks for any input!",

            "comment": "I\u2019m in the program, and in my second to last semester. That said, I came into the online program as a senior by hours, so my input may or may not be relevant to someone coming straight from JUCO. \n\nMy experience has been pretty good overall. The advisor for the program is Alli Bracewell, and she has been super helpful throughout the process. By far the best advisor I\u2019ve had (and I\u2019ve had several, for better or worse). You won\u2019t really have options as far as professors go. The scheduling and curriculum are pretty narrow because the program is small, and there are only certain professors involved in it. The course load requires pretty much the same amount of time online as it did when I was a traditional student, but the flexibility is nice. The size of the program means you\u2019ll probably get to know some of the people from your classes which can be pretty helpful. The biggest downside is not being able to choose your professors like you can to some extent as an on campus student. \n\nOverall it has been a great thing for me, and I hope your experience is similar!",

I\u2019ve made mostly A\u2019s, but the one course I have seriously struggled with was Business Processes and Controls which is a 3000 level accounting course that focuses heavily on SAP (accounting software). I was bad at it, and didn\u2019t feel like I was given enough guidance by the instructor. That said, I passed and I know others that had no issues with it. I\u2019ve also heard Financial Statement Analysis is tough, but I\u2019m not taking it until this upcoming spring.",

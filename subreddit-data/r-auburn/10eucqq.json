The only reason I don\u2019t want to go to Auburn is because it\u2019s ABSURDLY expensive compared to UAH\u2026 I also live within range of UAH to be a commuter. I know both have good programs, but Auburn has the actual \u201ccollege\u201d experience feel. I don\u2019t wanna kms at UAH but at the same time I don\u2019t want to sabotage myself in terms of student loan debt at Auburn. At UAH I can get the full tuition scholarship for a 30 on the ACT but Auburn is so stingy with merit scholarships\u2026 What do ya\u2019ll think? Is it really that bad?",

Furthermore, it is in state college level debt not top tier private college debt.  \n\nIf data is available, you need to see where comparable graduates of the two programs are in their careers 5, 10, or more years into them.  There may or may not be a difference or might not have been studied.\n\nAs a parent of three all around college age, I still believe the moving off and figuring things out on your own factor is very, very important to your development at that stage in life and hard to adequately place a dollar value on.",

UAH may not have the \u201ctraditional\u201d college experience but there will still be other students you\u2019ll have plenty in common with and you\u2019ll have the opportunity to go to house parties or play frisbee or hang at the breweries or go to shows or whatever. There is still campus life and clubs and activities and sports and all of that, and Huntsville has more much generally to go out and do than Auburn as a town. UAH is also a great school for engineering with a direct pipeline straight into the industry right in town, and recruiters are happy to place you elsewhere if you\u2019d prefer too. My advice is don\u2019t take on a bunch of debt for a degree you can get without it, unless there\u2019s something specific to Auburn that is a true dealbreaker for you.",

Due to its proximity to industry there are tons of opportunities for students. That being said, we also hire tons of Auburn grads.\n\nI will say it like this. How badly do you want a traditional college experience? Because going to UAH will not give you that in its entirety, especially if you choose to commute from home. I can never recommend someone go into debt when there is a semi-equivalent path to the same outcome without debt, but if you\u2019ve had your heart set on any particulars of the college experience, I would just warn you that they may not exist or exist in a reduced quality/quantity at UAH.\n\nBest of luck, ultimately there is no wrong answer. Just two different paths with different pros/cons. Remember to enjoy the journey and have confidence in whichever choice you make.",

I\u2019m now in grad school at Auburn so I can probably attest to both.\nI absolutely loved UAH for my undergrad experience. No, I didn\u2019t get to tailgate on weekends but I did get to be extremely active on campus in Greek life, leadership groups, and as an orientation leader (seriously the best thing I did in undergrad). UAH gave me a great education and none of the people I graduated with had any issues with finding a job. I know several people who were Aerospace as well, and they\u2019ve all done well with careers. Some working for NASA, some getting to move to their dream cities, etc. UAH is said to be the number return on investment and I 1000% agree with that. With that said, I also love Auburn now- it\u2019s a great college town, tailgates are the best time, but I honestly am very happy I didn\u2019t come here for undergrad. It\u2019s a very big school and you can easily get lost in the crowd (or lost in the party/binge drinking/skybar three times a week crowd - which is fun until you can\u2019t pass classes and you gain even more debt). As a grad student, I struggled with this balance so I can\u2019t even imagine being a 19 year old on my own for the first time. But maybe that\u2019s just me! It all comes down to you, your goals, your expectations, and your priorities! I\u2019ve had an incredible experience at both and I\u2019ll be a proud engineering alum of both UAH and Auburn!!",

B4 I go on I will have to list my education level and yrs attended AU even tho I hate listing it, it\u2019s very important. My ed. background:  BS Chemical Engineering with a Biochemical Concentration obtained June2000. As much as I bleed orange and blue currently at 46yrs of age, I\u2019d go to UAH hands down. AU had changed quite a bit since entering school FA1994 -June2000. The college of engineering\u2019s curriculum difficulty went up a little starting FA2000. The school changed to all semester from quarter in the previous yrs. Also, millions upon millions of $ was donated around this time too therefore, the PC Labs were revamped and became MUCH NICER. That\u2019s when the CoEng. Switched to Ginn i think ~FA2000. The CoE rankings at AU seem to inch towards the top 10-20th spots in the country. Albeit Auburn has such a more superior program vs the yrs ~1994. \nI haven\u2019t done the research on UAH\u2019s Aerospace program but I assume it must be pretty damn good hence the Madison County or Huntsville area was the birth of NASA(assumption). I\u2019d go to and finish UAH\u2019s program vs AU. Madison county seems to be littered with tons of Aerospace comps. too. Since u have those scholarship opportunities at UAH, I wouldn\u2019t bat another eye at AU. From 1994-2000, I left school with $~58K student loan debt where I cant imagine what it could be now?? I lived with my parents during this time which helped SO MUCH! \nI\u2019m not sure if I helped u any but meeting with an academic advisor would be my next step. I\u2019d do UAH tho given the state of the economy rt now.\n\nI hope that helps and as an AU Alum., I don\u2019t mind answering questions u may have if it all possible! GOOD LUCK!\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\n\nSincerely, \n\n\nMichael Williams(Michaelche2000@gmail.com)",

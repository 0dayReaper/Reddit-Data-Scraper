    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m starting a Students for Sensible Drug Policy chapter for Auburn University. I first need to garner a lot of support, so if you\u2019re interested at all in harm reduction, learning about and educating your peers on safe drug and alcohol consumption, seeing less people in prisons, saving lives and tax dollars, and ending the war on drugs please consider joining! It\u2019s really very low commitment and we won\u2019t require dues. I am also in need of some officers, and this would require more involvement if this happens to be something you\u2019re passionate about! DM me for the officer application.",

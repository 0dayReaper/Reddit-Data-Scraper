    "postText": "I have a full sized mattress and bed frame I\u2019m trying to get rid of. The bed frame is basically new because I didn\u2019t use it long before switching to a queen. It is also very lightweight and can be easily taken apart. The mattress is a little beat up and it has a hole and some stains but it could be flipped over. I just wanted to see if maybe someone wanted either before I threw them away.",

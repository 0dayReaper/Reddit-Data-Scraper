It might seem overkill, but it\u2019s great protection from gunfire. In some cases they can even be used to transport victims to a safe area, although this is rare. I know they talked about how they wished they had them during the Hollywood Shootout, but that was before modern SWAT was a thing. \n\nIn Auburn it will probably mostly sit in a garage. But that stuff happens here too. I remember an officer getting killed and two others wounded just last year in that barricaded suspect case, and then that other one before that where the apartment caught on fire or whatever. \n\nBut in the end it\u2019s not really a waste of money since they\u2019re so cheap. I know the PD back home got an armored car for like $500",

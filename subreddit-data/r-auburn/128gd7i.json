    "postText": "I'm an electrical engineering student from Germany. I'm going to study at Auburn University in the fall semester of 2023. I need to make a cost estimation for myself, but I am not sure which housing I should choose after I get my acceptance. Auburn University recommends 160 Ross for international students. 160 Ross looks and sounds pretty cool, but there are a lot of bad reviews. This led me to be a bit skeptical.   \nWhich housing would you recommend? Is 160 Ross a good place for international students or should I decide on one of the others?  \nOnly thing thats really important for me is a bedroom for myself and a bathroom that is not shared with too many people.",

Honestly very few places will have great reviews because student apartments tend to have below average maintenance and attention to detail. Do search around if you can, I remember a lot of international students were set up through the school at the complex I lived in and were charged significantly more.",

You will definitely get your own bathroom and bedroom, the only thing you\u2019ll have to share is the living room, kitchen, and the washer and dryer. You have guaranteed parking in a garage and a nice pool. It\u2019s a good walk to campus but there\u2019s the Tiger Transit. All in all, i\u2019d definitely recommend 160. I\u2019ve had a good experience!",

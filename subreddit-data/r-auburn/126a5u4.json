No marked parking spots, which is good as guests can park wherever. Units will vary on quality or modern renovations as many are or have been owned privately. I will add that maintenance was always very responsive",

We own a 2 story unit and in one year of ownership have gained $40k in equity. I\u2019ve been inside both styles 1 bedroom and 2 bedroom a lot and I highly recommend a 2 bedroom for an office/game room or guest room. Spending a lot of time at your place and having a full kitchen is really nice \n\nIf renting it will be fine but you have multiple options. Either through a owner who rents their out and through the many rental agencies who lease units either owned by individuals or through Lakewood commons itself. \n\nI\u2019d really look at the placements of the buildings when making your decision since you said there\u2019s so many being rented out you have your choice. Decide if you like to spend time outside. The buildings by the tennis courts on that side of the lake are always in the sun when it\u2019s late. The pool is nice but the walk isn\u2019t bad so don\u2019t worry about living close to it. \n\nAlso if you hate speed bumps avoid living further back bc there\u2019s multiple but if you live in the front side there\u2019s none or 1.",

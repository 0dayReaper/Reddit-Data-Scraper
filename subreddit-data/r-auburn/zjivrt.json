I graduated in media studies, but halfway through my schooling the school added the visual media track which would\u2019ve helped me more with my career. \n\nPost graduation I still found a job in the field I wanted to work in. I can\u2019t say my major was really worth it, it feels more like just getting a degree was the point. That being said whatever practical experience you may be missing with your classes you can easily make up for by being intentional with your internships, work outside of class, and other pursued interests. This is what helped me most in the long run.\n\nBest of luck and war eagle!",

Graphic design is another option, but you need good Adobe Creative Cloud skills. I have known media studies students who get marketing minors as well. Someone else mentioned this, but be intentional with your internships/college work experiences. If you are interested in social media getting a communications major and marketing minor would be a powerful combo.",

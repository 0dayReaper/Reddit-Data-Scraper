I believe in The Creed, which says in part:\n\n\u201cI believe in honesty and truthfulness, without which I cannot win the respect and confidence of my fellow men.\n\nI believe in a sound mind, in a sound body and a spirit that is not afraid, and in clean sports that develop these qualities.\n\nI believe in obedience to law because it protects the rights of all.\u201d\n\nTell me how Hugh Freeze embodies this. Because I love Auburn I can call out the trustees who don\u2019t seem to respect it.",

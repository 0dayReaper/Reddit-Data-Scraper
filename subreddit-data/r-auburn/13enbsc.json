So does anyone know of a good place to get a tire leak fixed? There\u2019s a place where I\u2019m from that does it for $25 but I can\u2019t go there because they are closed on the weekends and I can\u2019t make it during the week. Is there anywhere here with a similar deal or even one that\u2019s just a little more expensive?",

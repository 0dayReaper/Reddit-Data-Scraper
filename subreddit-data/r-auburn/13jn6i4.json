I\u2019m tired, lost, defeated, and then I remember\u2026there\u2019s a chick-fil-a across the street\u2026a sandwich and a drink could make this whole ordeal go from painful to blissful. I will make it out of these trenches and arrive victoriously to the promise land. I\u2019m saved. I get in my car and drive straight towards this beacon of light, all my suffering has paid off\u2026.finally\u2026and then\u2026.! Instead of a bustling crowd of happy and satisfied customers, I arrive at a crumbling dump full of dirt piles and parked heavy equipment\u2026caution tape\u2026.traffic cones\u2026.not a living soul in sight. My hunger and thirst grow, my spirits sink, and I realize there\u2019s nothing in this desolate waste land to save me\u2026.\n\nThen I wake up with cold sweats in my bed. \n\nOnly it\u2019s REAL and it happens EVERY TIME I HAVE TO GO SHOPPING.",

I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s possible to take some prereq classes online over the summer (calc 1, English 101 is what I was specifically thinking). Is this possible ?",

Wait for an email.\n\nDON'T TAKE CALC 1 THIS WAY UNLESS YOU ARE A SAVANT. \n\nGet as many English, history, theater, anthro or whatever as you can but do not take your first college math or science in summer. You will cry.",

Fall semester is only about 15 weeks. That pace takes getting used to. Summer is even shorter- only 10 weeks.\n\nMany math classes are graded on 3 exams and a final. Your first time having each exam be 20% and the final 40% is very intense. You have to learn to study for that course structure. It gets you mentally ready for engineering if you survive it. Lol then you only have 2 exams and a final.\n\nCombining the transition from highschool pacing/intensity with a short summer semester can make you feel like you can't handle college.",

It's a little faster pace, but I found that to be better because it tends to cut out the fat. I would not recommend Calc 1 and Physics 1 over the summer. I did that my first semester here after not being in school for 10 years... it was rough, like - \"I am going to drop out of college\" rough... still got an A, but I gave my heart and soul...so it is absolutely possible. I would recommend taking genEds in the summer, like English or History. I took History I and II concurrently over a summer and though it was a lot, I would 100% do it again. I also tossed in another degree related course that semester and it was honestly one of the best.",

If you want to take classes through other colleges, as long as they are accepted you can go that route. I never took a class elsewhere because it was \u201ceasier\u201d.

Honestly I much preferred SUSCC\u2019s math teaching to Auburn\u2019s. Their teachers are good at really starting at the basics and building up to the deeper concepts. Fair tests and homework, I\u2019d certainly say easier than Auburn but I don\u2019t feel like I sacrificed any understanding of the concepts.",

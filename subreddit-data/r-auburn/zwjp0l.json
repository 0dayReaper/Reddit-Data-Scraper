    "postText": "I want a rubber/hard cover for the outside bottom of my new purse but I can\u2019t find what I\u2019m looking for on Amazon, Etsy, etc. it\u2019s probably too specific. I\u2019m not picky on the material. Has anyone had experience 3D printing at the university? Or know of a place in the area that would do it? It\u2019s probably 14\u201dx5\u201dx3\u201d and I want it to fit on the bottom of my bag. I want to take it places but not get the bottom dirty when I set it on the ground. Thanks!",

You might play with one of the free 3d modeling tools to do the design work. I\u2019m trying to remember what I used, I think it was blender or sketch up.",

(Is it 14x5, 14x3 or 5x3).\n\nAlso keep in mind that the 3d printed part will likely detract from the style points for said bag (you will be able to tell it's 3d printed).\n\nAs many have suggested, the maker space provides earned access to really good machines. However, if you don't already have experience with CAD software, a custom design like this gets very time consuming.\n\nIf you want someone to design and print this for you, I may be able to help you out depending on your wants/needs (message me).\n\nCoincidentally I have a 14\" by 14\" build plate so this is pushing it.",

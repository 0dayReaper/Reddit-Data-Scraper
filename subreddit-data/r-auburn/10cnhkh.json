Background data usage for TikTok is usually 10x to 100x that of normal app usage. It would be quite easy to leverage TikTok enabled devices to do whatever is needed. TikTok users really need to take a hard long look at the terms of agreement? There is a reason why KlikBot is banned from US government devices.  Auburn banning TikTok from state-owned devices and networks is proper Risk Management. What a person does on the their own device(s) and data plan is their own risk.\n\nNot all VPNs are safe to use in China because the VPN provider has to give \"The Great Wall\" backdoor access.\n\nSubstantiated info pertaining to TikTok security issues can be found anywhere.",

This also ignores that the data is still owned since last year by American company Oracle, whose servers are in the US. The collection and selling of data has already happened and continues to happen, TikTok notwithstanding. The push not just for institutional bans but broadly and the rhetoric behind it betrays the disingenuous nature of the argument. Facebook and YouTube for example have been used constantly to promote agitprop and organize domestic terrorist activity while suppressing other types of content and was full of divisive Russian bot content. But now that another app is effective at organizing leftist activity rather than just pushing domestic terrorist pipeline content and ragebait on everyone, the ownership class that sets govt policies has a sudden pressing need to eliminate it.",

Have you looked into data that is collected by TikTok? NONPUBLIC data is being harvested. Private users can do whatever they want on their personal device and network access. However, from a Risk Management standpoint it is in the best interest of local governments, the federal government and businesses to prevent TikTok from harvesting data from their networks.\n\nNow let's jump back to your what-about-isms. Unbeknownst to you, there are plenty of social medial apps and sites that are banned from being used on government/business owned devices and networks. Why? Because more than just personal data gets collected. Why is that so difficult to understand?",

Data which is easily sold to china by these entities anyway. \n\nThe selective outrage about TikTok whose data servers are, once again, owned by oracle and located domestically as of last year, falls flat when data harvesting by domestic companies of sensitive data is ongoing, and has been used for more political instability and terror than any access to data the Chinese may still have. The other banned apps are also Chinese, which signals that this is more about anti-China sentiment and less about an honest data risk assessment given also the abysmal state of up to date and secure institutional technology in most of the US government and even many universities.",

Reddit, FB, Instagram, Google and many more NON-enemy of the state apps/sites are banned from being used on/by certain government-owned devices and devices. So of course the overly intrusive data farming apps ***controlled*** by the \"actors\" known for unethical usage of captured data are being blocked or banned.  \n\nChina and some its friends block apps/sites to control the the information within their purview so they can control the narrative for propaganda related reasons. Blocking/banning TikTok is preventing the exfiltration of PII/PHI/PCI and sensitive data by a state sponsored actor. Do you understand the difference? Yes, this data can most likely be purchased elsewhere but why go through the trouble of purchasing the data when China can get it for free via TikTok. Why does Tiktok need to capture keystokes on a video based app? This keystroke capturing easily leads to capturing any data input on the device. Yes, there are other sites and apps that  perform this unethical action. But guess what? TikTok is the subject of this conversation.   \n\nThe human factor is the biggest issue. Most users do not bother to read TikTok's Terms of Service, do not take the time to configure what the app is able to do and are too busy soaking up the digital gratification to worry about their own data security. This is why governments and businesses have to consider the RISK of having TikTok on their networks.  If the risk is not acceptable, there is but one choice to be made. **BLOCK/BAN** the app or site.\n\nAnti-China ..... blah blah blah. Does TikTok provide countries, other than China, with backdoor access to the app? Ummmm ... NO!! Anybody with half-consciousness knows backdoor access to an app or site breeds unethical activity that can be easily leveraged.       \n\nDo I use TikTok? No! Why? Because I think a vast majority of the vids have no merit. \n\nHave I performed a case study on app security (not just TikTok)? Yes! \n\nWhy? I have encountered apps that capture unnecessary data. And because the interwebs are full of people spouting useless information that they read on some website with some talking head who gets their jollies off of causing controversy. This is why I tell my friends and coworkers to check their app settings and read the Terms of Service. Many people will uninstall apps after learning that they cannot control what an app will capture. The worse part is many apps will PURPOSELY reset back to their default data capturing settings after an update is installed. Some apps/games will refuse to function if you do not allow the app/game to capture your movements. This is done to prevent cheating/spoofing but at the same time it is intrusive.  Why? Because the app/game will continue to track your movements when it is not being used.",

Very telling that you consider China the enemy of the state, with zero knowledge of what they're collecting, why, or how they would use it.

Instead you're ONLY willing to discuss one app/country in a way that presents the current actions as consistent with a stance on true data security measures, when your very lack of ability to NAME another such American-based security risk NOR addressing the actual data server locations belies your selective outrage and completely inconsistent beliefs. \n\nI mean you fully admitted that other sites and apps, including ones used on every govt device to this day are engaging in the same behavior, but you ONLY have an issue when EVIL CHINA is involved. You know what that tells everyone? That you dont have any ideological integrity, and can't see posturing for what it is.\nImagine being so inconsistent that you're fine with American billionaires owning the government and refuse honest critique, but immediately refer to anything Chinese as an enemy.

Say Elon musk needs a quick cash influx and saudi Arabia has money for data, you really don't think he would? That's a lot of trust to put in them for such a dire risk to important data. Beyond that, how many very public hacks have already happened with these companies, passwords included? What if they can just claim a hack when really they made a backdoor deal to sell 30 million passwords to china? Whos going to prevent that? It's too late after they've done it and after it goes public and after an investigation. Their vulnerabilities are massive, but no big push to ban the American apps. It's theater for the sake of sinophobia. If the data is so critical, they shouldn't be taking piecemeal measures and risking being controlled by Zuckerberg et al's interests to totally own china.",

Might I suggest reading Principles of Communism or Socialism: Utopian and Scientific, both by Friedrich Engels? And for Capitalism, maybe Kapital by Marx? I know it's a bit of a slog but even the first 2 chapters of volume one hold some real general insight. \n\nIn short, capitalism (an economic system defined by private ownership over socially worked means of the production of socially utilized goods, as opposed to subsistence production, in which the accretion of capital is both the means and ends of economic actors) by default removes the check on authority over time, because they are enabled to, and rewarded for, purchasing politicians, bureaucrats, police, judges, lawyers, news sources, entertainment, land, food, water, energy, small businesses, think tanks, educational institutions, banks, prisons, and the military. \n\nEven when not outright buying companies or making bribes, their ability to engage in capital strikes (where they raise prices in response to unfavorable pending legislation) to threaten stability, makes the neoliberal government of every capitalist country inherently act in the interests of capital. Especially when basic necessities are privatized and thus subject to arbitrary price increases and perpetual extraction of profit on every unit, because meeting the needs of the poor and of basic maintenance of society becomes more expensive, with price ratcheting on any guaranteed privatized good (like private education and federally guaranteed loans), and becomes unsustainable. \n\nFurther, the competition in the marketplace inevitably produces winners and rewards those who have already previously won. Every bust cycle spells the death of 90% of small businesses, who end up acquired by larger businesses that carve out oligopolistic spheres of influence and engage in rent seeking to pull the ladder up after them, much like power companies. \n\nThe tracking of laws to public desire for those laws is uncorrelated, about a 30% flat chance. The tracking of laws to large private interests is almost 70%. The government isn't controlling the economy, the owners are controlling the government. They choose who appears in elections for you to choose from, lie to you, manufacture consent through media and education, and engage in merciless exploration of the working class of the entire world. Especially the global south, in America's case. Accomplished, I might add, by 250 coup attempts in 70 years across the world by the CIA and the military, many against democratically elected and popular socialist governments, whom they then lied about and convinced you not to look any further. After WWII when the US absorbed a shocking number of Fascists from both Europe and Japan, (we had a sizable open fascist movement until the year before pearl harbor, as did eastern Europe), these fascists were put into positions of power in our military, in NATO, in the CIA, and their common interest of hating communists, (as you're no doubt aware communists and socialist leaders and sympathizers have been the first casualties of any capitalist and fascist revolutions, such as the Reichstag fire trial and night of the long knives) led them to put out massive amounts of propaganda to the western world and through radio free Europe and radio free Asia, siege embargoes, sanctions on global trade, McCarthyism, and the aforementioned coups. \n\nSocialist countries led by Communist vanguard parties instead have had free education, healthcare, housing, transit, more democratic institutions, cooperative workplaces, no inflation, higher life expectancies, more doctors, no crimes of need, better sense of community, subsidized basic foods, and more. Why? Because the central goal of communism is a society for and by the workers who create it, and socialism is the economic system of control of the means of production and of society by the workers of those industries, with a \"government of things\" (an administrative state for coordination and aggregation of needs) also controlled by the revolutionary political arm of those same workers. \n\nIf you like unions, no child labor, civil rights, decent working hours and conditions, overtime pay, no company towns, thank a socialist, the forefront of every struggle against the inevitable problems created by the system of capital.",

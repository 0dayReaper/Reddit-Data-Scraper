Definitely recommend\n\nHey y\u2019all, I dont live in auburn full time but I will be over the summer while working an internship. \n\n\nWhat\u2019s a good place to get a haircut? For context:\n\nI\u2019m a male in my 20\u2019s, probably get my hair cut every 2-3 months. Since the person who always cut my hair back home in Georgia retired a couple years ago, I\u2019ve always tried to go somewhere kinda \u201cnice\u201d and asked them to just do whatever they wanted. I\u2019m sure someone who cuts hair professionally knows what will work better than I do.",

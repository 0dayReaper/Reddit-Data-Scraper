    "postText": "The man appears transparent and honest to me. This is his speech from convocation at Liberty about 4 years ago. If you\u2019re willing to bash the man, do us all the courtesy of watching this first. His section starts around the 9 minute mark. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/T4zq1KO7qII\n\nHere is a little more  insight around the allegations flying around and his history:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/grizzlyadams16/status/1597393252340346880?s=42&amp;t=ELBjb4_-mGhT6ra6nSsX2Q\n\nHere are some insights about his family, specifically the type of daughter he raised:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/wherring54/status/1597040105734144000?s=20&amp;t=E0GbyiGPzvILbxCXpEXyTQ\n\nHere is his opening press conference: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/fBZmMCdLiaE\n\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about the creed, about cultural fit and about his representation of our beloved university. After you watch these, genuinely and curiously, I\u2019m not sure how you can come to the conclusion that this isn\u2019t the right man for the job. The conclusion that he will be an embarrassment to our university is a farce. He owns his mistakes, he is honest and he appears truthful. He has a charismatic spirit, a spirit that is truly not afraid. He has a history of hard work. His hard work yielded success at every level of his career. \n\nA cherry on top of all this? His family is with him. And not just here in presence, but truly WITH him. They support him. Based on their own words they have forgiven him and support him as best a family can. So, if his wife and family have forgiven him, who are we to hold judgment?\n\nAs a member of the Auburn family, I think it\u2019s time we extend grace, and welcome Hugh Freeze with open arms. Is he perfect? No. Neither are anyone of us. Anyone who approaches their shortcomings head on, albeit in the public eye, and then continues to push forward against all odds is exactly who I want leading this team. Especially with the forgiveness and full support of the ones they hurt most. It\u2019s time we get to know Hugh, as an Auburn man and our head football coach. \n\nWar Eagle \ud83e\udd85",

Called the students at Briarcrest liars:\n\n[https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/ole-miss-football/hugh-freeze-denies-former-briarcrest-female-students-accusations-inappropriate-behavior/](https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/ole-miss-football/hugh-freeze-denies-former-briarcrest-female-students-accusations-inappropriate-behavior/)\n\n&gt;\u201cThese accusations are totally false. I can unequivocally say that   \nduring my time at Briarcrest Christian School I handled disciplinary   \nissues professionally and in accordance with the school\u2019s policy. I am   \nvery confident that the members of the administration who worked hand in  \n hand with me during my tenure will verify that.\u201d\n\n2. Denied calling escorts after getting caught:\n\n[https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/\\_/id/20117453/hugh-freeze-ole-miss-rebels-resigns-escort-service-calls-cited](https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/20117453/hugh-freeze-ole-miss-rebels-resigns-escort-service-calls-cited)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"We call the wrong numbers all the time,\" Freeze said.\n\n   3. Denied his involvement in the smear campaign against Houston Nutt to pin recruiting violations he committed on Nutt publicly.\n\n[https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2017/7/20/15971800/hugh-freeze-ole-miss-houston-nutt-lawsuit](https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2017/7/20/15971800/hugh-freeze-ole-miss-houston-nutt-lawsuit)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u201cWell, Coach Freeze told me when you\u2019re that big and out there with   \nfaith in Christ, he\u2019s like, \u2018What do you expect? Jesus got nailed to the  \n cross.\u2019\u201d\n\n4. Lied to recruits and  players at Ole Miss about the severity of the sanctions they were staring down.\n\n[https://sports.yahoo.com/report-transferring-ole-miss-players-tell-ncaa-hugh-freeze-deceived-010517515.html](https://sports.yahoo.com/report-transferring-ole-miss-players-tell-ncaa-hugh-freeze-deceived-010517515.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;According to CBS Sports,  \n six transferring Ole Miss players are in the process of compiling   \nmessages from the coach that show he attempted to minimize and deflect   \nthe NCAA\u2019s allegations against the school. They\u2019d then use those   \nmessages to show the NCAA why they should be granted immediate   \neligibility at their transfer destinations because they didn\u2019t know the   \npotential severity of any sanctions levied toward the school.\n\n5.  Would appreciate it if everyone could just, you know, get over all that stuff\n\n&gt;\u201cTo my knowledge, I\u2019ve tried, with anybody I could, I made sure they   \nknew that if I hurt them I was sorry, but it\u2019s time to move on,\u201d he   \nsaid. \u201cHow many times can we write about it? How many times can we talk   \nabout it? I said I was wrong. I\u2019ve paid a price. My family paid a heck   \nof a price. When can we move on?\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHugh Freeze is a narcissistic opportunist who ducks behind a Bible at the first opportunity, and anyone who believes he's expressed honest contrition or \"paid the price\" is a painfully gullible fool.",

This is a multi millionaire who's set for life and has had multiple high profile coaching gigs. \n\nThere are plenty of people who don't have his questionable background who have NOT been given a chance.  I want to give those people a chance. \n\nBut I'm one of those weird Auburn fans who doesn't really give a ton of weight to winning national championships. Is it great if it happens? Sure.

I think this is someone who has a proven track record of success while also working everyday to be a better man and overcome some major issues in his past. I believe second chances are earned little by little everyday and that Freeze has earned another opportunity. And as long as he continues to work each day to get better then this is a fair opportunity. \n\nIf we can win 10+ games or another Natty that will be great too lol",

And when he was first announced I was shocked. So I started looking things up and trying to find accounts of people who do know him personally. So far, I\u2019ve found comments from players throughout his tenure that speak very highly of him, I\u2019ve seen accounts of people connected with his family who have nothing but good things to say. I watched our AD admit to hiring a private investigator, an ncaa official rep and even a law firm to make sure everything about Freeze is pointing in the right direction. Based on all of those, as well interviews and talks by Freeze himself, i feel confident in the man he appears to be. I feel confident the university choose a good (and improving) man to lead our football program.",

He's just stupid for sending them in the first place.

Including some people that I know that were ready to protest the hire on Toomer's corner.\n\nFirst he said that \"integrity is not about getting it right, because then none of us would have it. It is About what you do when you don\u2019t get it right.\"\n\nThen he addressed those who have concerns over his character by asking for a chance, just to keep an open mind and allow him the opportunity to build trust\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe man has done some pretty awful things in his past, no doubt. dumb things? yes. malicious things? absolutely. Aside from 2 dm's (that I would encourage you to read the content of) he has been very clean the past 5 years. His players tell stories of his leadership and how concerned he is with their personal lives. His staff talks about how he prioritizes work/life balance and bends over backwards for his staff to get personal time for their families. I understand why people don't like the hire from a moral or strictly football perspective. I less understand why you won't let his current actions speak for itself, and keep an open mind.",

Second, each season until the NCAA investigations started he improved. He won 7 games in 2012, 8 games in \u201813, 9 games in \u201814 and ultimately his best season in 2015 he won 10 games. This has only happened 3x there in the entire history of Ole Miss Football. Yes they regressed his last season but there were some off the field issues happening as we all know. He went 3-1 in now games including winning the sugar bowl. He had Ole Miss ranked as high as number 3 (in back to back seasons) which is the highest their program has ever been ranked. \n\nHe then goes to Liberty were they literally entered D1 in his first year as HC. He proceeds to win 8 games and then 10 games. He knocked off power 5 programs each year. \n\nAside from all this, he has produced several first round draft picks proving he can not only win games but can develop talent too. \n\nSo yes, I\u2019d say the man is a better than mediocre.",

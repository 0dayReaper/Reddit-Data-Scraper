Is the 100 dollars in cash/check/etc? And finally, what college/lab is doing the project and who is the PI for this project? Thank you in advance for taking the time to answer my questions.",

Participants will need to come to the Auburn Univeristy campus for approximately 3.5 hours, during which they'll take multiple psychometric tests and then lay in an MRI scanner for approximately 1 hour.\nThis study is a collaboration between the CBRA lab at the Unviersity of Alabama (PI: Dr. Rajesh Kana), and Auburn University. \nPlease let me know what other information I can provide!",

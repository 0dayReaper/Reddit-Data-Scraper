But just check your email and do what it says.\n\nStart working on housing arrangements now. If you're in a dorm, try and coordinate with your roommate because you don't need two microwaves, two fridges, etc. Some dorms have fridges in the common areas. I moved with a dorm fridge for two years and it was just a waste of time, money, and electricity.\n\nSame thing with a coffee maker. You can buy one, or you can just subscribe to the Panera sip club and get unlimited coffee and drinks in the library and never buy a drink with a meal again.\n\nThe cheapest ways to eat on campus is a block meal plan ticket or Panera using loyalty coupons + value duet meals and the sip club subscription plus the extra coupons it gives you. Everything else is a scam. Never buy anything in the c-stores, walk to the new Publix instead.",

    "postText": "So I\u2019m a freshman at auburn and last fall I stayed in a double suite in the village, overall my experience was just ok. I barely ever saw my roommate which is good that we got along but overall it felt very isolating as I don\u2019t know anyone in my hall leaving me feeling often lonely. I read that university housing has a room swap week for this spring later this month and I\u2019ve been considering switching to somewhere like 160 Ross, since it\u2019s a nicer facility and a little bit cheaper than where I\u2019m staying now (I don\u2019t mind too much that it\u2019s far from campus) I\u2019m a little hesitant about whether it\u2019s worth it or not to move in the middle of the year so I wanted to ask if anyone knows more about doing room swap/if it worked out for them.",

My friends also did the room swap in the middle of their freshman year (she went from the quad to the hill) and she doesn\u2019t regret it one bit. She met me and our friends that way!",

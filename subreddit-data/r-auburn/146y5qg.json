Just throwing this out there because I have been here a few times, and it seems dead. Figured getting the word out couldn't hurt. Also the Ramen is good as well, just not discounted currently.",

It started off as a counter service ramen place, and now it\u2019s a table service hibachi and sushi place (because we needed another one) that happens to serve ramen. I love a good bowl of ramen, so I haven\u2019t eaten anything else there, but the ramen quality seems to have slipped since they changed their format.",

But that building might just be cursed. It has kinda failed no matter what is there.  I personally haven't had a bad experience there yet (maybe 5 visits since it opened).",

We ate their Sunday (2 people) I had hibachi steak and scallop, and she had hibachi steak. Total was $25. Tipped $10 (based on total if none sale price) so $35 for 2. \n\nWe have had lunch there also several times just getting sushi. 6-8 (3-4 specialty, and 2-4 regular) rolls under $50.  Typically it's in the $25-$30 range for 2 people, for sushi.",

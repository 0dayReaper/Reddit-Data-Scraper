The much older people tend to be extra polite and that was like my first culture shock.\n\nComing to Alabama, I was really nervous about racism and what my experience would be, but so far, it has been so nice. I just wish the younger people, my peers, would be slightly more friendly. None have been rude or hateful, I just think they don\u2019t care enough to notice or speak to people that are not familiar with and that\u2019s fine lol.",

Cultural clubs for minorities are very active, with a diversity and inclusion office that sponsors most (if not all) of them. There's definitely a noticeable white majority here though. I do think a lot of the non international student POC act more \"whitewashed\" compared to other places.\n\nMy honest advice is that there are good/bad people everywhere. There are racist people here, like anywhere, but there are also many people who will love you for who you are. Auburn is such a big campus, you will find your people if you decide to go here. Don't let stereotypes get to you too much.",

The community outside of Auburn University is actually way, way more diverse than I would have imagined. Black, latino, asian, everything. Everyone just minds their business. I'm a light skinned latino and I've felt included the majority of the time but I definitely notice how other POC are way too isolated. I just feel that, while tolerant and respectful for sure, the scene is just way too white-centric. I don't see how you can debate that last point tbh - at least as opposed to, say, Atlanta, Miami, NYC, LA, etc.",

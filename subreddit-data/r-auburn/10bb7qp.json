            "comment": "Men\u2019s basketball tickets are incredibly difficult to come by these days unless you are willing to pay a premium. You could get in as a student if you were willing to wait in line for several hours for general student seating, but that wouldn\u2019t get your family in. \n\nAs for other sports, women\u2019s basketball games are never crowded, tickets are cheap and plentiful, and are very family-friendly. Baseball usually has tickets available unless it\u2019s a big SEC series. Softball is a little tougher because a small number of people have hoarded a huge amount of season tickets, but you can usually get standing room for those. Gymnastics tickets are very sparse this year, but once Suni leaves after this season they will probably be a little easier to come by. \n\nBeyond those sports and football, all other home athletic events (volleyball, soccer, tennis, track, equestrian, swimming, golf) are free of charge.",

            "comment": "You'd have to buy them tickets, but sitting together could be very difficult. Auburn basketball has gotten better in the past 5 years.  I graduated in 2020, and that year we had the final 4 run, people were camping out and skipping classes a while day before tickets would be dropped. So, I can only assume that they enforce seating pretty strictly.",

            "comment": "They sell standing room only tickets that are pretty cheap for weekday games, you wouldn\u2019t have seats but could stand together, you would go in the student entrance which is right next to the normal entrance and then meet up, you obviously would be sitting in the student section but that is the only reason people camp out and once it\u2019s full students can still go in they just get standing room only essentially. I graduated in the winter but would still go with my friends once the spring semester started and it works perfectly!",

It's unfortunate that you can't use your student credentials as a recent grad to at least finish out the season. \n\nCan you buy tickets at the arena, same day? I know the doors open early for students, but non-students would have a different time/door to enter?",

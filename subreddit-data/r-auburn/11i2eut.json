Unfortunately, I got denied last night but it gave me an option to enter their transfer enrollment pathways where I would be eligible to transfer to Auburn after completing 24 or more semester credit hours. Does every applicant who get denied also receive this option?",

I\u2019ve maintained a 4.0 GPA as an engineer and have never got a merit based scholarship.. oddly enough a few of my BIPOC classmates have though. Family income is in the $50k-$75k range, so nothing incredible that would otherwise have me overlooked.. Auburn seems to only be interested in funding athletes and demographics over hard work and merit. So much for our Creed. \n\nI did get a $50 parking ticket in PC2 though! Even though I have a parking pass in PC2. Some game was going on while I was at class and I didn\u2019t move quick enough. Appealed and was told to cry to someone who cares. War Eagle.",

I don't know whether or not that got me a leg up, because I'm definitely not at that level. But, I also didn't apply test optional. I had the bare minimum to get an academic scholarship. Auburn must care about the standardized test (especially if you're coming from out of state) because that's the only true indicator of how you did, unfortunate as it is. My GPA is skewed simply because I turn in work and I'm a motivated student with 15+ AP courses.",

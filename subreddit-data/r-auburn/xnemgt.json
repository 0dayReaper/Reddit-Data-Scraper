I\u2019m a full time student and I work a part time job on campus, so I\u2019m looking for somewhere that\u2019s more on the less expensive side. I just want to do what\u2019s best for her, but I am trying to not spend as much. thanks in advance!!",

            "comment": "You can fill out paperwork and can get a pet spayed or neutered for under $20, depending on your income and your residency. You can go online to Lee County Humane website : [https://www.leecountyhumane.org/low-cost-spay-neuter](https://www.leecountyhumane.org/low-cost-spay-neuter) for more information. \n\nIf you do not qualify for this, there are vets that have \"Good Samaritan\" programs, check around. I had 4 kittens I rescued and had them all done- the boys were cheaper under $200, but the one female was a little more around $225. My vet before was Parkway Animal Hospital and they did a great job with the 1st cat I rescued and he was 2 years old(usually it cost more the older they are). I have a different vet this go around and I felt I paid more for per kitten but it could be medicine and surgery cost had gone up. We had to take our 1st cat rescue into the Auburn University all night Vet School and it was costly for an accident he had, but they do bill you, so they may be willing to work out a payment plan. Definitely would not hurt to check that option out and being a student as someone said it may come out a cheaper for you.\n\nThank you for helping take care of the kitty. Spaying and neutering is good for so many reasons. I wish more people would do this!",

I also know that most clinics in town also will use \u201ccare credit\u201d or similar independent parties to issue loans if paying over multiple months would be easier. Just if you are eligible for SNYP, the people working reception would appreciate it if you mention that you are using SNYP when booking the appointment!",

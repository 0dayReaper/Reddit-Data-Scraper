Last time I went as a student, they checked my ticket and student ID to make sure it\u2019s mine.",

After the purchase, you may enter for guest pass lottery where you can bring one guest with $20-50 dollar extra. Considering how some game tickets are pretty expensive and having a good seats for being in student section, I think it\u2019s a great deal. You do not need to buy all guest passes though.",

You can enter into the ticket pool raffle the Sunday before the ticketless game for that ticket at noon, have a friend get you a guest pass, or just buy a standard ticket to the game and sneak in (once you\u2019re in the stadium just show your student ID to a security guard at the partition and say one of the other guards let you go see your family about 15 minutes before kickoff). \n\nEvery remaining year you get tickets to all home games. Every other sporting event is first come first served.",

Another example is a food cost switch they made was going down to the smaller 3.5oz doritos bags and cutting it from 4 --&gt; 3 slices of cheese on the nachos\n\nMan.

I have seen so many eateries and bars come and go in that town It's not even funny. What you seem to fail to understand is that in the couple of years the federal government has injected itself into private businesses more and more. That's not how businesses thrive and people get paid. You think CEOs make all the money you think they're really keeping a strangle hold on most in everything. Look at what business owners have to pay out in insurance and lost wages and in taxes to the federal government. You start adding all that up. You start realizing that businesses have a huge burden on themselves. Take a look at what's happening with Walgreens, CVS and even Walmart. Theft is gone up so much in the last couple of years that they are shutting down a lot of their stores taking away jobs and hurting communities. Seems to me like I remember the last time we had a recession like this was between 2009 and 2015... Every time the government starts spending like there's no tomorrow on stupid shit the taxpayers face the brunt. Don't know what you do for a living but you have to start considering all the other impacts on the economy.",

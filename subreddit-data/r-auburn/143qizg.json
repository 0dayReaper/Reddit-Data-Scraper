So it's fantastic if you want brand new stuff that was unsold or returned on Amazon/e-commerce platforms... But not if you want anything vintage or preowned etc! \n\nI love all of them honestly Ive had great pulls at them all.",

Hit up Americas thrift store behind the lowes, and Botanic across the street. Great first stop and options for coffee juice and food to fuel up. From there\u2026.\n\nTake Fredericks to downtown Opelika\u2026it  has a good clothes store which is \u201cfringe consignment\u201d (more girly and high end) and then the farmers market cuddled up against the Dayspring natural grocery, which also has plant pop ups some times. Don\u2019t forget Angles antique mall around the corner, it is a great stop because it\u2019s way more than antiques. Also a good place to take a walk through town on a nice day. \n\n\nFrom there, the next two-stop is the goodwill and the habitat for humanity store on Pepperelle parkway. Before you get down to the mall, stop at \u201cvine ripe year round\u201d on the corner of 280 and the parkway. They have local produce and seasonal plants. Habitat for humanity has more furnishings and hardware and god knows what than any other thrift. It\u2019s focused on home improvement and receives construction leftovers and furniture. They even have clothes now. \n\nIf you need another few thrift stops go right down the parkway towards the mall to harvest thrift\u2026tucked behind the Waffle House. Shitty but huge.  Smells bad. But has so much inventory. \n\nThe last best place is mission thrift behind the zaxbys and neighborhood Walmart in the mall area. They have become more expensive in the past two years and you\u2019ve got to catch them on a good day otherwise it\u2019s picked clean. But when it hits, it hits hard.",

Also this one isn\u2019t a thrift store but you can find good overstock items, but take a look at Crazy Cazboys too! Happy thrifting!",

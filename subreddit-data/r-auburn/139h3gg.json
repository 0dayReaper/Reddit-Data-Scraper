    "postText": "Hey everyone I gm for a pathfinder group typically ran on weekends Friday and Saturday mainly! This group includes three of my friends and my wife. My wife has became disinterested in playing and so we are looking to fill her spot at the table. If you\u2019ve wanted to try TTRPGS and have never had the opportunity this group is perfect for you as we are new to the system and still learning ourselves. If you are pathfinder veteran and know a ton of stuff even better as you it\u2019s always nice to have someone to cross reference rules and info with. The system may change from time to time with the group as to keep us from burning out. If you are interested shoot me a dm and I\u2019d be happy to reach out and provide a bit about me and the group. If you don\u2019t know anything about pathfinder but are interested reach out anyways we welcome new players with open arms!",

We are only on the first book of 6 so still time for you to get on at the ground floor and learn with us! I also have a Vampire: The Masquerade campaign planned out far far far in the future!",

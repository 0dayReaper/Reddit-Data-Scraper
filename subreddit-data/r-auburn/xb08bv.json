            "comment": "It\u2019s pretty big  so on a busy night the vibe is different depending on where in there you\u2019re at, the \u201cboom boom room\u201d is like a club but the main area you come into is just kinda your typical southern bar, there\u2019s pool, karaoke or either some random ass local country singer on stage. It\u2019s crowded as hell on weekends especially game weekends. I don\u2019t like it personally because the rapey shit that goes on and honestly I\u2019ve just always went to south? Idk why I just like it. The bartenders know what I drink, and I don\u2019t pay cover usually if they have one that night. Plus it\u2019s a little more chill. I don\u2019t go to 17 often but I\u2019d say it\u2019s definitely more like south than sky from my limited experiences. \n\nAs far as going alone I\u2019ve never went to any of the bars downtown alone atleast not when I wasn\u2019t planning on meeting someone there.  So idk, but generally people are friendly especially when they get in the sauce I\u2019ve found. So shouldn\u2019t be to hard to make friends my only experience just going to bars alone and just planning on drinking alone all night (don\u2019t you judge me, it\u2019s hard out here sometimes) it\u2019s been one of the smaller more rural ones in the area like the robin or the circle W. And honestly it\u2019s best to keep to yourself in those sometimes anyway. Cause you know how like.. college guys get drunk and think there tough and start shit. Well those are inhabited by older sometimes less savory characters who the drink has the same effect on except well.. there actual tough guys lol. But overall I\u2019d say the bar scene round here is pretty cool if you know how to act. Just my 2 cents",

If that's the vibe you want and you're ok with the crowds, then that's where you want to go. Me personally, I hate it and I go maybe once a year if I have a reason. My personal reasons for disliking it are because a decent chunk of the people are underage and I have zero interest in meeting underage girls, bartenders were never even remotely friendly to me, and the crowds and music really aggravate my tinnitus. Also they charge cover unless you come early and I'm not paying 10 or 15 bucks just cause they feel like it and I'm busy until the evening",

The fact is that it is the busiest bar, has cheap drinks, has fun live entertainment, is large, and usually results in the most fun downtown experience.

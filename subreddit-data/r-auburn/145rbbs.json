Also remember that when you get into the \"exotic\" pets the cost rises astronomically. Specialized vets, specialized food, extremely delicate habitats have to be maintained and none of it is cheap. I would suggest watching a YouTube channel called Snake Discovery.. They are pretty amazing and they have a lot of exotic animals they deal with on a daily basis. A lot of people get pets like this without realizing what they're in store for and it is not good for the owners nor the animals. I have had everything from iguanas to 6 ft plus pythons. Takes dedication and care. I sacrificed a lot of time and money for my pets but they always have the best care.",

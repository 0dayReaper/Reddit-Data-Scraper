He brought us some of the greatest moments in our team\u2019s history, and he is arguably the only current coach in CFB who has been able to even somewhat consistently beat Nick Saban. Most of this was many years ago though, and I agree it was probably time to move on, but I appreciate everything Gus did for Auburn over the past many years.",

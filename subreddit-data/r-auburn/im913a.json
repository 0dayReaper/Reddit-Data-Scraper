    "postText": "With Labor Day weekend upon us no one would have thought that we\u2019d still be dealing with COVID. Yet, here we are and so are the park employees at Chewacla. \n\nThey have worked tirelessly through the pandemic giving us, at times, our only place to go outside of the house. \n\nIf you go to Chewacla this holiday weekend, give them special thanks at the gate for sticking with us during this crazy time.\n\nEdit: DISCLAIMER I don\u2019t work there, I\u2019m not related to anyone that works there, I don\u2019t know anyone that works there personally. I simply pass through the gate like everyone else.",

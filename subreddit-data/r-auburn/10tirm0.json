I know at my last university we just went to a website and downloaded our student ticket to our mobile wallet and if we wanted an extra ticket it was only like $10. Is auburn similar?",

Otherwise it's always the same group of people who don't mind wasting half their day standing in the cold. \n\nAuburn's a football school and I've never had to wait four hours to get in. It's inefficient.",

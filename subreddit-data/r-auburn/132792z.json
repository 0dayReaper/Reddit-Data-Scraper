I ask this with all due respect, but we\u2019re they *actually* directly transphobic, or did they do something like say \u201csir\u201d when they saw you and took your order? To most people, when they see a person w/ things like a male physique, or a penis or a five o\u2019clock shadow, or a credit card that says \u2018Timmy\u2019, they may assume it\u2019s a man. They aren\u2019t necessarily trying to belittle you or make you feel any less than *on purpose.* But not being able to read your mind and then being transphobic are not the same thing. \n\nI think it\u2019s very important to distinguish the two. These accusations can destroy reputations and businesses. This happen way too many times but what was really meant was not \u201cthey hate lgbt and were mean to me\u201d, but rather \u201ci personally feel bothered and upset they misgendered me on first glance. But it was not done in malice .\u201d",

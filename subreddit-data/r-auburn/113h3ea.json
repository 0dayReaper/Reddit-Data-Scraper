I\u2019m now 25 and looking to finish up my degree online in the BSBA program, but I\u2019ll be having to work full time as well to support myself. Any good job recommendations that won\u2019t be too conflicting and reasonable? I\u2019ve thought about getting into leasing/property management but not sure if the pay is good. Appreciate any feedback.",

    "postText": "I was diagnosed with ADHD as a young adult a few years ago but took a break from the medication for a year due to the cost being hard to manage at the time. I am considering starting back since my school schedule will be increasing substantially but was wondering what hoops I would have to jump through. I do take Delta 8 and CBD products to help me sleep and to improve my appetite while on ADHD meds which will show up as a positive on a drug test that includes THC. Will I have problems with that at AFM?",

            "comment": "You'll be recommended to a psychologist first for an evaluation and then once that is done they will refer you back to Auburn Family Medicine. There may still be a shortage for some ADHD meds, so keep that in mind. \n\nI did not experience a drug test when I received mine, but I would definitely consider if there are any potential adverse effects when you mix usage of the two together. You may have slight personality changes with ADHD meds and those could be greater when you're under the influence of another drug.",

Depending on how long it\u2019s been since you last had a prescription you may be able to just get it transferred. Most of the family medicine places will require a full ADHD evaluation  which can be upwards of a couple thousand bucks out of pocket\u2014most insurance policies will only cover around half, not including your deductible. \n\nYou should be fine as far as drug testing goes. Delta 8 and CBD products are legal, even though they can give you a positive THC test. You can disclose it to your practitioner/psychiatrist beforehand and most won\u2019t care. Some may recommend not taking them, but in my experience, they mostly do that with concerns on effects for anxiety, panic attacks, etc",

I\u2019ve struggled with losing too much weight on ADHD meds before and got to a point it was unsustainable and it\u2019s what helped the most on top of eating before taking the medication in the morning.",

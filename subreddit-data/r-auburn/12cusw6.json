I did notice a bit of blatant homophobia but it was like 1 or 2 occurrences over the course of 7 years. In my experience, Auburn is a very chill place and people treat each other like family regardless of who they are.",

To be fair, if you're white and you're not at least in the periphery of the \u201cit scene\u201d you'll be a ghost, too. Having said that, I think people in general are left alone, but it is tough too see just how isolated some people are.\n\nEdit: The first part applies to being involved in general. It doesn't have to be the frat scene or the general short skirts/tank top vibe, but being involved in clubs or academic groups, etc. Being a lone wolf is where it gets tough, white or not, but more so - in my opinion - if you are a minority.",

I\u2019m hoping to get one for a lot with a charger and hope for the best. \n\nIf not we\u2019ll have to burn 40 minutes after the game at a fast charger. \n\nThanks!!",

[There are 15 stations on campus alone](https://ocm.auburn.edu/newsroom/campus_notices/faculty_staff/2018/06/parking-services-announces-15-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-on-campus.php), but I do not know what level they are. We always use the Level 3 Electrify America chargers at the Walmart off S College, which also has one Level 2. If you have a Tesla, there are Tesla stations at the mall on the Belk side across from the satellite DMV office. [Here is a list of all the chargers in Auburn.](https://www.plugshare.com/directory/us/alabama/auburn-opelika)",

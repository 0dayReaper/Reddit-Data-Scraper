Because they are both intentional wear items, they are made to be easy for the owner to change. You don\u2019t need a full tool set, check on a forum for the make/model of your car and you can find out what you need (examples, for a Miata, just a 14mm, some cars need a 14mm for pads and 17mm for rotors, some Toyota trucks need just a 17mm for both). I am currently not local, but look at the AUctane Facebook group and mention your year/make/model and see if anyone else has one. Also for any car that exists, there will be an depth YouTube tutorial for first time brake changers specific for your car.",

If you\u2019re not a jerk to them, most car guys are super helpful and willing to help you. You can do it yourself and borrow their tools/equipment. [Rock Auto](https://www.rockauto.com/) typically has better prices than the likes of AutoZone. I just replaced front pads/rotors and air filters for less than $250 and I put on ceramic pads. The local shop was quoting me almost $300 for just the brake job. If you can find someone with equipment, you could probably gets pads and rotors for under $200. Just remember to buy 1 set of pads, but 2 rotors, since they\u2019re sold individually.\n\nIf that isn\u2019t an option, I\u2019m sorry for not having a good/cheap shop recommendation. I haven\u2019t need a shop in Auburn yet.",

Guy is a certified Honda technician that used to work at the dealership and got tired of it, so he decided to just work out of his house. Prices are great, turn around is fast, and I've never had a problem with any of his work.

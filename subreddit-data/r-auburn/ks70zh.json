The question is what did they do to be connected, and does that give them real reason to ask for my vote to represent me.  \n\nTommy T got it on his name only, and the fact that he ran as an R in Alabama.  His abilities of a football coach, and his limited attempt as an AD, do not qualify him to be a senator.  He is connected, because he is a famous football coach.  The fact that our fellow Alabamians allowed Tommy T to use his football fame, and football fame only, is pathetic.  Anyone who voted for this guy, including my parents, are idiots for doing so.  At least elect someone who has read and can understand the Constitution.",

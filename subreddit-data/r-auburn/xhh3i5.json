It\u2019s really meant to target people who live on / by campus like the new target, which are absolutely in walking or bus system distance.

Ignore that there are at least 6 churches that many locals attend within a block of each of their precious \u201ccity amenities\u201d. Ignore that all of those businesses you love to drink at have employees that can no longer afford to live in Auburn proper and have to DRIVE from places like Opelika, Notasulga, and Tuskegee. Also completely ignoring the fact that the construction of West &amp; Wright (Evolve), Uncommon, The Standard, 191 College, 320 West Mag, and Oliv fucked up traffic in two-lane streets by adding parking decks that filter into those small streets at all times of day is far worse for congestion than the minute traffic of a (comparatively small) grocery store parking lot is so asinine that it\u2019s hilarious. Traffic was rough on game days and A-day before those complexes came to town, and we act like it was always bad, but it was NEVER the level that it now is almost 24/7 on Glenn/College, on Magnolia in front of Shelby, or on any of the cross streets north of campus. You\u2019d have to circle the block looking for parking downtown most days outside of the summer, but you were never in a lot of gridlock outside of maybe a busy Friday/Saturday night - now you\u2019re waiting 2 or 3 light cycles to go fucking straight through an intersection and it\u2019s just getting worse.",

And I know you didn\u2019t just mention the buses like those are even remotely reliable or timely or accessible or convenient enough to use as transportation to a job that requires consistent punctuality.\n\nI know you\u2019ve got a really convenient high horse to ride around all day, but unfortunately the rest of us don\u2019t and while I do agree with you that car culture sucks and isn\u2019t exactly environmentally sustainable, but fuck off with the \u201cparking lots are why car culture is so rampant\u201d bullshit.\n\nUnless the employees live downtown, walking is not viable, especially considering the state of the sidewalks in Auburn. If you live downtown and can walk there, great. Not everyone can afford that privilege.\n\nParking lots aren\u2019t the problem, they\u2019re a symptom of the real problem: woefully inadequate public transportation and horribly car-centric city planning.

I and most other people aren\u2019t going to walk an half an hour or more to work or to get groceries barring absolute necessity. Why? It\u2019s a pain in the ass and not feasible if you\u2019re planning on getting enough groceries to last even a week.\n\n&gt; in a country where punctuality was everything\n\n\nSo, just like this one?\n\n\n&gt; this was the norm for everybody there\n\n\nWhere are we, here or there? Because that\u2019s not the norm *here*.\n\n\n&gt; if im on my high horse its because i know this shit is possible\n\n\nYup. Possible, not but not currently feasible. It\u2019s *possible* for me to walk all the way from here to Canada, but you sure as hell won\u2019t catch me doing it before Satan\u2019s able to make snow angels.

Are you aware that most people won\u2019t walk more than 15 minutes to a certain point? That\u2019s ~0.8 miles for the able bodied. I live in Auburn, but 3 miles from downtown. That\u2019d be a **1 hour walk**. Rain? 95\u00b0 weather? Traffic that wants to kill me? All for an hour? HA yea okay buddy, I\u2019ll drive 10 minutes, but thanks.\n\n&gt; i can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re for or against car-centric planning\n\nWell, conveniently, I said in my first reply to you: \u201cI agree cars aren\u2019t the greatest solution.\u201d In my second reply to you, I said: \u201cwhile I do agree with you that car culture sucks.\u201d And here, I\u2019ll say it one more time: I hate car centric city planning and **all** of the problems that it entails. Hopefully we\u2019re on the same page now.\n\nBut finally: Auburn public transport is ASS dude, I wouldn\u2019t trust it to get me anywhere on time even under the utmost perfect circumstances. You suggest people should be dropped off or park nearby, but *what problem does this solve*? Definitely not the car one. And no one except the people that live in the apartments smack dab in the middle of downtown are going to walk to that Publix, sorry.\n\nSo why are you so against the parking lot? You don\u2019t seem to care about the cars since you offered solutions that *require* just as many cars and emissions, but you do seem to hate the parking lot. Is it an eyesore thing for you? Because it\u2019s really just starting to sound like \u201cI don\u2019t want to look at an ugly parking lot,\u201d which is a bit insensitive to the people that can\u2019t afford to live close enough to walk everywhere downtown.",

Busses and bikes aren\u2019t as reliable for one, and not real sources of grocery transportation. I for one am happy we have something right near most of the students, and young families who can drive or walk a few minutes to get things.",

I agree with the OP even if most don't but I'm against big parking lots because I want Auburn to be livable and enjoyable. Think about the opportunity cost of the space. But people on the other side are not evil or backwards.\n\nConsider Tuscaloosa- it's impossible to get around without a car. We're clearly a better town in part because of that. I just want us as a town to capitalize on what we do have and not sell it out to dumb ass chains or turn us into East Cobb or Hoover.",

I can take free classes at auburn, thinking it might be beneficial to get another degree for some future work but don\u2019t really know how the old classes come into play. \n\n\nThanks",

            "comment": "Post-bac degrees are tricky.  You can generally use all the classes you took for core requirements toward a second undergraduate degree but will have to take the major requirements for the second degree. Graduate degrees (like a master's) usually take no credits earned as an undergraduate and won't let you use credits earned as part of another degree of the same level. So while you can't use classes taken as a master's student for a second master's, you might be able to use them toward a doctorate if the program is set up that way. A lot of it is also program to program, so its hard to make a general answer that will apply to all degree programs.",

She did everything for both degrees but they didn't care. She couldn't have a BFA in Ceramics to go along with her BFA in Illustration. Completely different programs with completely different requirements but they said no. \n\nTheir loss. She graduated Summa Cum Laude and she never hears from them. They don't even know she exists, I guess. One of their most talented graduates in years. It is a pretty sore point for me.",

I will go to Publix one week and the same product will be sold for less at Kroger the next week. I am tired of these big time grocery stores squeezing every dollar out of me and other college students.",

That means it flies off their shelves quicker and is replaced quicker with fresher produce.  Plus, ALDI's house brand products are really good quality foods.  Save the Publix and Kroger for the few specific brand name things that you just can't do without or find anywhere else.",

Even if you don\u2019t use their methods completely, they may have helpful tips on how you can maximize your time and minimize your money spent. Also, don\u2019t forget about stores price matching competitors. As long as you can prove, the competitor is selling it at X price many stores will be willing to match it.",

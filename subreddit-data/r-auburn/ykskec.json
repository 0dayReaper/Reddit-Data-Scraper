    "postText": "Just out of curiosity, what would everyone think is a fair rent for one room in a 4 bed house? It\u2019s just outside the loop, this is mainly a hypothetical. I am losing options on rentals because of my dogs and I\u2019m looking at almost $1900 at current rates. I want to be fair but it\u2019s still going to be pretty expensive for myself. \n\nI will ask for 1/2 utilities. For one person. I pay $1k for my apartment now.",

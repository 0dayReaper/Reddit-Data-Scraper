I'd love a signet ring too, I *hate* the one for women with the sunburst diamonds, I'd  love to have  a simple one with the seal. It's classic, imho. AU going with Balfour only for class rings was a huge mistake.  The one for men is so generic.  Good luck finding what you want.  \n\nps: you could also look for vintage AU class rings and have the date/degree changed on the sides of the rings. My youngest has his grandfathers and we had it altered to represent his year and his degree.",

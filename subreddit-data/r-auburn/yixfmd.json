I tried planet fitness a couple months ago with a free day pass and left after about 20 minutes because I felt so awkward. The lady at the front desk was less than helpful and I ruminated on that and decided in my head I was unwelcome then I left lol.",

            "comment": "I lifted at Tiger Iron when I was in Auburn. Pretty decent gym and has about anything you could want equipment-wise. Pretty cheap if I remember right also.\n\nMy two cents about getting started at the gym is that you\u2019re gonna feel awkward and it\u2019s gonna be uncomfortable mentally for a while, that\u2019s just fairly unavoidable. But anyone who\u2019s worth a damn doesn\u2019t care what you\u2019re doing at worst and at best they\u2019d love to help if asked. Jacked people have made a hobby and a lifestyle out of lifting and most people love getting asked about their passions and getting new people into their passions.\n\nMy other piece of advice is to head over to r/fitness, check out their wiki, pick a program you like, and just go do it. Having the certainty of what exercises you\u2019re there to do and how much weight for how many reps will help with the awkwardness. Just plug in some headphones and do what\u2019s on the paper.",

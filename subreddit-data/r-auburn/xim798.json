    "postText": "As freshman I just haven't met anyone, besides just basic small talk. I know clubs are one of the best ways to do, but I just don't which I want join really. Intramural sports I interested in but also don't know which I want to do. Frats are am option but idk much about them, besides the basic stereotypes. Any suggestions?\n\nSome interest include: aerospace, coding, games, music\n\nI am not the religious type so stuff about that is off the table",

Are you taking a foreign language, because they also have clubs (and the profs tend to give extra points if you join their foreign language clubs, so BONUS!).  \n\nAuburn has a Hockey Club, that's kind of fun to support.   There is Kickball and Cornhole, which are Intramural sports, but outside of the box and kind of fun. Also Pickleball.  Just something 'different' to think about. \n\nNot sure if Rush is ongoing, but checking out some of the fraternities might tell you if you are interested in joining. Some are stereotypical and others are not.  \n\nAlso there are a lot of clubs that are related to majors.  \n\nWhen I was in school people could also get involved with WEGL, the GLOM and the Plainsman.",

Go to a place of worship and/or join a campus ministry. \n\nI approached freshman year with the mindset of joining everything I could at the start of the semester and then dropping what I didn\u2019t really care for as the semester got busier.

You can generally buy session tickets for the first two rounds pretty cheap, but with Alabama and Auburn both going to Birmingham it\u2019s going to be tough.\n\nIf by some miracle we make it to the F4, they give the opportunity to buy a ticket for $50 based on who went to the most games during the season.",

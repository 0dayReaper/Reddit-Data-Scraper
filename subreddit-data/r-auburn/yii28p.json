    "postText": "After a recent injury, my typical fitness options are off the table for several months. \n\nPre-surgery, I am looking to stay in shape. I have a little exposure to heavy bag training, and it seems like something I should be able to do in my current state. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t want to be the only female in the boxing gym, and prefer less-busy ones if possible. Does such a gym exist? Just wanting to get a baseline of where to start my search. \n\nAlso considering investing in my own bag and stand.",

Knowledgeable folks, never made me spend money on things I don\u2019t actually need, even recommended I go elsewhere for save money on certain jobs. Best in town. \n\nThat said, I do most of my own maintenance on my vehicles so I know what doesn\u2019t pass the smell test. Take my vehicles there for larger work that I don\u2019t have tools for. Timing belts, large engine work, etc.",

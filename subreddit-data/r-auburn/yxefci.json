I feel like Auburn has all the resources to be successful; all my art professors have been amazing and extremely helpful, there are plenty of resources to get what you need to do done, and the vibe is really nice. It\u2019s not fancy and some of the art buildings aren\u2019t the best on campus, but I\u2019ve been able to be successful. The environment is probably my favorite part of the art department. I feel like since Auburn isn\u2019t like a \u201ctop art school\u201d it feels a lot more casual and not as cutthroat as I\u2019ve heard about programs at other schools. All the students are really supportive and you get a lot of people that are doing art because they love it. The downside is that you might find that not everyone is taking it as seriously as you. Altogether, I love the art program. I feel like it\u2019s challenging, but not like impossible critiques with professors that act like nothing you do will ever live up to their expectations.",

It was casual for the most part, but that's not really what college is for. You should be pushed hard. If you want to get good at art, there's youtube, books, and classes outside of college for it. \n\nIf you want to get a degree adjacent to it that can actually make you some money, look into design / graphic design.\n\nCollege is a pretty big scam. It's a shitload of debt that you will be paying back until you're middle aged. Do not put yourself in the kind of debt that could have been used towards buying a house just so you can spend 4 years painting and drawing with some chill people.\n\n**EDIT** I would like to also point out that of my handful of friends from the art department, I know of only one of them that has continued to find success in art as a career - and they weren't anyone I was close with. They were renowned as being a fantastic painter throughout the building. They also had a strong \"narrative\" (LGBTQ / African American) which, like it or not, is pretty important when it comes to selling art.\n\nThe careers most of these friends ended up in include: bartender, stay at home moms, educator (they went back to school again for it), mechanic, actor. One did end up a sculpture instructor, not at a university though. \n\nI personally am a buyer for a car dealership. I finished with a degree in graphic design after it started to become apparent I was wasting my time with an art degree. I took a year off from school and worked bad jobs before I went back for graphic design. I ended up swapping careers though as I ultimately disliked having a new client (boss) every week and the work became less and less rewarding for me personally. Now I only do designs for friends who need something done for some side money (and because it's nice to help them with their businesses). I create art still, but only when I'm really feeling passionate about it (which happens like a few times a year TBH).",

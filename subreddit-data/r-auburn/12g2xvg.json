Be prepared each class, as he will call on anyone and everyone and will note if you do not know the answer. Also, he'll remember you at meet the firms event when you come.back to recruit years later. Good guy. Intermediate is a tough one, so.spend some time on it everyday",

For Intermediate II, Dr. James Long. Two amazing professors.\n\nhttps://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/2732474\n\nhttps://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/1387216",

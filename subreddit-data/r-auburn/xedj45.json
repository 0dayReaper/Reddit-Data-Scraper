Since the manual recommends regular oil and it was built with that in mind, that's what I put in it. I'm sure there would probably be no issues with a synthetic blend or full synthetic oil, but my car has 113k miles on it and is going strong with the recommended maintenance plan. I take a \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it approach\" with this car. But like with my 2018 Escape, yeah it will get synthetic.",

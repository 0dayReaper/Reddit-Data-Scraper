I often find them tucked in there hiding from cars if they get stuck out in our front yard. We are on a active street and they find safety there. The drain right in front of our house opens up to a creek in our back yard and they will come out on that end most every time. So it is worth a look. I shake some treats and that helps too. I will also add if there is an open field anywhere near your home, look there. If traffic is a big deal where you are they will stay put where ever they are until they feel safe. I had one that stayed all day, I finally got him to come out to me after a good hour of calling him. He had been missing for over 10 hours. I also keep my pet carrier with me while searching too.\n\nKeep us posted when you find your fur baby.",

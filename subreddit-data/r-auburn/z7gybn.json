    "postText": "Article published July 18, 2022 on [*insidehighered.com*](https://insidehighered.com) , by writer Josh Moody. \n\n\\- Liberty University football coach Hugh Freeze has taken to Twitter to defend LU athletics from criticism around controversial hires, including **direct messaging a sexual assault survivor who sued the university** for mishandling her case **and won.**\n\n\\- Chelsea Andrews, a former Liberty student, was one of more than 20 plaintiffs who sued Liberty last year, alleging the university mishandled sexual assault cases and Title IX issues for years. (Liberty reached a [partial settlement](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2022/05/12/liberty-university-partially-settles-title-ix-lawsuit) with various plaintiffs in May.) Andrews has tweeted critically about LU and its athletics program. **One of her complaints was the** [**hiring of Ian McCaw**](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2016/11/29/liberty-u-hires-former-baylor-athletics-director) **as athletic director, given that McCaw served in that capacity at Baylor University during a rampant** [**sexual assault scandal**](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/06/08/baylor-administrator-discusses-sexual-assaults-impact-university)**.** Seemingly irked by the criticism, Freeze rallied to McCaw\u2019s defense.\n\n**- \u201cYou don\u2019t even know Ian McCaw,\u201d Freeze said in a direct message to Andrews**\u2014one of several sent in recent months and verified by *Inside Higher Ed*\u2014adding McCaw is a **\u201cJesus like leader.\u201d**\n\n\\- Andrews declined to comment but [questioned Freeze\u2019s activity](https://twitter.com/chelsandrews/status/1545983057232027648) in a tweet: \u201c**Why is the head football coach at Liberty University DMing me** during and after my lawsuit with LU? **At almost midnight.** When I didn\u2019t tag him. &amp; I haven\u2019t responded to the other DMs he\u2019s sent over the months,\u201d \n\nSeems like the university just hired a very mature, even-keeled person. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2022/07/18/liberty-coach-takes-aim-sex-assault-survivor-twitter](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2022/07/18/liberty-coach-takes-aim-sex-assault-survivor-twitter)",

A male authority figure, such as the head football coach, under no circumstance should harass a female student or alumni via unsanctioned channels for any reason whatsoever. But much less to attempt to quiet a student or alumni who is a RAPE survivor that successfully sued the university for mishandling her case and who is exercising a fundamental right of free speech, on a public platform, to seek systemic changes in the university's predatory sexual culture.",

One thing that\u2019s missing here is that she had previously accused him of having rapists on the football team and did @ him / tag him in the tweet. \n\nIt was after the tweet where she tagged him saying rapists are in the team that he sent the first DM asking to have a conversation around her accusations. It was not harassment at that point. She never replied to that message and kept making accusations against him and the AD. That\u2019s what led to the DM she released but she released without all the context or even all the content. \n\nAgain. He should have sent any communication through an attorney based on the accusations she was making.",

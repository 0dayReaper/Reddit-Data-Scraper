Acre was  being built across the street from my front balcony.\n\nThat said, if we look back in time, how different is this from JC Penney, Sears, Pizitz, A&amp;W, Piggly Wiggly, etc stores. occupying prime real estate in downtown areas just fifty years ago? They located where the people are and Target's no different. Same sort of thing, just a different tenant in a different era.",

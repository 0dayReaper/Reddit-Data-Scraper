We also have a reputation for creating highly qualified graduates, no matter what they major in. If you\u2019re looking for a good school with a strong community that you can find a few good friends to study with, the Auburn Family is very real and you will not regret the decision to come here. Our campus also tends to be much cleaner and has a much more \u201chomey\u201d/ small town feel.",

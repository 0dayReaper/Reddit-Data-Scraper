I'm wondering if there is a difference in coverage of appointments going thru the EAP. \n\nI'd appreciate any insight that anyone can share. Feel free to message me if you don't want to post publicly. Thanks!",

This is just standard therapy.\n\nFor diagnosis and psych coverage, it seems we have coverage separate from insurance, with its own co-pay: https://www.auburn.edu/administration/human_resources/benefits/thrive/mental-health-substance-abuse.html\n\nHonestly, I'd call EAP and ask for their advice. They are VERY nice and patient and will make sure you understand your options.",

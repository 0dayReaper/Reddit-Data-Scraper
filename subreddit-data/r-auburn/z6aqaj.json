He actually suggested that I just \"deal with it.\"  I ended up seeing a doctor at Dermatology Specialists who has since retired I think.  She got me a on a treatment program and was fairly straight with me.  She even gave me a timeline for expectations, and sure enough, it was all cleared up.  Every time I asked for her, they said she was no longer with them.  So she either quit or retired.  Either way, I wouldn't recommend Nash to anyone.  The man's office tried to charge me for a \"missed office visit\" that he cancelled the morning of the appointment.",

Honestly, may want to see how you look with a well kept beard, but it that isn\u2019t an option, ointments and creams. Using an electric razor to keep almost a shadow but not get a clean shave is also an option. I don\u2019t know any cheap dermatologists, but with how much info is out there on PFB, you should be set.",

    "postText": "Has anyone taken classes at Auburn and then switched to the online computer science degree? Do you have to fill out another application if you are currently at Auburn? I\u2019m at Auburn now and just switched my major to computer science, but I am not sure how to get into the Auburn online computer science program. I have sent an email and called the office but have gotten no response.",

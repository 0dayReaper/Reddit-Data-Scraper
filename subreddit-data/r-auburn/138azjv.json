I was driving and saw a bus that had the Auburn coloring on it and said to myself \u201chey look, a tiger transit\u201d as a joke. I then passed it and saw they didn\u2019t even scrape the Auburn logo off of it. It had \u201cRIT\u201d on the digital sign on top of it. \nI saw another one later that day that was the same style bus, but at least they painted over the Auburn logo.",

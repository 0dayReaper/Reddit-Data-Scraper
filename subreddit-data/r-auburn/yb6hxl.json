Alpha Eta Rho \u201cis a professional collegiate aviation fraternity founded in 1929 to bring together students that have a common interest in the field of Aviation.\u201d It\u2019s open to men and women. I agree with most people that you\u2019re better off not being in a fraternity; this is the only one I would join, particularly under your circumstances (I am a Professional Flight student as well). It\u2019s a good organization worth your time.",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019ve been at Auburn since 2021. I started out in engineering, but decided that it wasn\u2019t what I wanted to do. I am now majoring in psychology, but I am considering changing majors. I am considering either accounting or computer science. Which has a better program? For context: I have taken MATLAB, and passed with a B. However, I took an intro to software engineering class, and was very confused in this class (Python) but did not feel my professor was great (it was mostly teach yourself). Thoughts? What are the job prospects for both?",

CS will change over time. Plenty of job opportunities in both. Accountants and developers are needed in most every company in America. \n\nI will say CS is mostly self-taught. You\u2019ll learn more on the internet than you will in the classroom. \n\nAlso- don\u2019t let a MATLAB class determine whether or not you pursue a career in this. I only use MATLAB for analysis as a developer (and I\u2019d prefer to use Python in almost all cases). Overall, biased toward CS because of the higher ceiling!",

It's not always the most fun major at first, because the first 2 courses aren't the best, but if you can learn by making side projects or joining clubs you'll have great opportunities. CS and accounting are solid majors that aren't going anywhere, but CS is a highly competitive field, as high-paying jobs get tons of applications, so personal projects, and experience matter. I would maybe decide after taking Comp 1210 if programming is something for you. It can be a lot of fun, but it can suck if you don't enjoy it.",

Definitely reach out to Colby Lakas to talk about what majoring in accounting would look like for you. Information Systems Management is also kind of a combination of business and technology that might interest you. There\u2019s a good amount of opportunities that combine Accounting and Technology (IT Audit, Risk Advisory, Internal Controls) that might interest you. Accounting is definitely difficult but if you\u2019re pretty analytical then it might be for you.",

Rich people never use their own money and \u201cspreading\u201d their finances takes a bit of discipline.  After that, it\u2019s a matter of getting their ratios lined up and/or making a case to the executive why the loan is under the bank\u2019s acceptable risk limits.    \n\nAs an underwriter for the wealth management business at say, JPMorgan Chase, the business is also relatively recession proof.  The ultra wealthy suffer losses like the rest of us but, with those added zeros, still have a lot of room to maneuver!   I know of one group that has more than 30 openings.  This is after that same bank went through 4 rounds of layoffs of mortgage underwriters.  \n\nThat creative side of your might enjoy finance and underwriting between than accounting and is literally numbers glorified.  Good luck!",

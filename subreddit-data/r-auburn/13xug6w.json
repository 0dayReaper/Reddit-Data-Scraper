    "postText": "Got out and got a great job and have moved all over the company and have been a production manager of a small team that makes animal care products for going on 6 years.  I am looking for a technical/management position in the Auburn-Opelika area.  I am currently employed and do not necessarily need a job but am looking to broaden my skillset and move into the Auburn area.  I have experience building, programming, and troubleshooting PLC's, fluid system design, and am also the go-to for EPA regulations.  Strong background in chemistry. I have worn many hats, but it feels like it is time to move on.  I just started scanning job boards and figured I would try here too. Thanks, and God bless!",

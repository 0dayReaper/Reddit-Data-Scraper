                    "comment": "I agree with you that the focus for pro-lifers should not be protesting against abortion rights, but sadly the foster care system is quite flawed. Regardless if the child is raised in a non-abusive home, they still will be at risk of social issues and risk of prison. This is due to the fact that keeping the family together has a greater impact on the development of a child. \n\nWe don't have an abortion issue, we have a poverty issue. When it costs an average of $310,000 to raise a child, and the average income in the US is $30,000, that means you would have to work more than ten years just to raise one child. This doesn't include your mortgage, your bills, or your debt( student loans, car payments). It would be advantageous to have two adults raising a child, but unfortunately divorce runs you the risk of having to divide your incomes amongst two households, and lawyer's legal fees.\n\nMost sexually mature adults in relationships engage in sexual activity, this is natural and it is encoded in our DNA to do so. That said, preventing intercourse is a senseless method. Teaching abstinence, and not preparing young adults on how to use contraceptives correctly is going to inadvertently increase their risk of an unplanned pregnancy. Not every young couple has wealthy parents to cover the costs of raising a child, therefore expecting couples have options( Adoption, surrendering the child to be a ward of the state, or abortion).\n\nIn summation, until there is no more poverty in this country, and all families can provide more than enough to raise a child, a woman's right to choose will remain. \n\nJoel Osteen has a net worth of $50million, yet rather than adopting kids out of the foster care system, he expects his \"camels\" to pass through an eye of a needle.\ud83e\udef3\ud83c\udfa4",

    "postText": "Hey guys! Due to some medical reasons, I had to take a semester off this fall, and I\u2019m moving back for the spring semester the second week of January. I know this is a last minute search request, but my housing plans fell through earlier this week. I\u2019m currently a student at Auburn unable to drive because of medical reasons, so if anyone knows a place near campus, let me know!",

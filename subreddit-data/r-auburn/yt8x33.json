He\u2019s slowly made his way from Beauregard to Auburn, and I just want to know if there\u2019s any journalism done on this guy yet.",

Someone in the Beauregard Community Concerns group on Facebook reached out to him earlier this year and he declined any help from any kind of shelter, as it seems he prefers to be out by himself. There are a few folks in the Facebook group that appear to regularly make sure to check up on him and make sure he has some food.",

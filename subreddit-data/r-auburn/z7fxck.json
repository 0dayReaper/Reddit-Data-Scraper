Just 5 min from campus (drive), Tiger stop steps away from the door. Pet friendly with washer and dryer. Any furniture we can't take with us will be yours.\u00a0 The relet lease is from mid-December (January) through July 2023. December rent will be paid. Rent with wifi $1075, utilities not included. We are unable to take our furniture and are motivated to get this relet. DM with interest or with any questions.",

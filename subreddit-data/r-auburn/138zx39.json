At all of my graduations (high school, college, masters) it\u2019s all been paper rolls. \n\nI\u2019m grateful for that - after every graduation I\u2019m out at dinners or parties. I don\u2019t want to be responsible for that thing. I think I funneled a beer with my fake Auburn diploma when the Vault was still a thing.",

It'\ns completely legal as well. Most of them want 2016 or newer cars and most of them want cars over 40k. If you want a supercar in China import taxes are insane. You would be paying 3x or 4x the price of a Porsche in China. So the rich kids get to ride in really nice cars while they are here for such a short time. There is some shady business to it as well. There are a group of Kids in college selling cars to Chinese forging their names and overcharging them. Kids are paying cash for cars they did not want and the kids selling them are not giving them refunds. Pretty fucked up. I know one Chinese student who ordered a Porsche 911 4s but received a Base Porsche 911 and the people just stuck 4s badges on it. He found out when I scanned his vin number getting some body work done. ",

            "comment": "Remember that college is fully subsidized in most of the developed world so most international students are typically from rich or super rich families (typically from very urban areas) that can afford to send their children to the US for university. In Asia especially, the middle class isnt as prominent so thats why so many of them you see at Auburn are quite loaded. You also have to consider that they most likely have gone from a very high cost of living in an urban environment (like Seoul) to a rural environment with some of the lowest costs of living in the US.  Seoul is basically the Paris or New York of Asia which is why a lot of them wear the fashionable clothes they do and why I cringe when I hear someone say they have \u201cAsian Swag\u201d. I know a lot Auburn students that would stand out in a crowd in NY/London/Paris. \n\nFYI: I just like understanding why people are the way they are and how/where they grew up influenced that. Not dogging anyone.",

Before he came here, he thought that he would be considered middle to lower class because he heard from his friends that Auburn is a school where rich parents in places like Mountain Brook send their kids, but once he got here he was really confused as to why people were so shocked when he got the BMW i8 as soon as it hit the market. He was even more confused when people were surprised to hear that it barely put a dent into his parents' pockets. It was always really funny going shopping with him because I'd save up $$$ for a while to get a nice suit at Brooks Brothers because that's what I considered high end, but we'd go to the mall after and he'd get a bunch of $300 shirts/pants, $2000 - $3000 jackets (that cost the same as my god damn suit I got at Brooks Brothers 30 minutes before), and etc. because his mom was pissed he wasn't buying enough clothes for himself.",

Neither know any other internationals that own sports cars. \nAs car cost I can tell you that cars are cheaper in the US in comparison to other places (I\u2019m from EU). For instance, a V8 Mustang can be 3x more expensive in Europe than in US because of eco-taxes. I can only imagine how much more expensive western, Japanese and Korean cars can be in China just on import taxes. That\u2019s why they have all those shitty remakes of BMW, Ford etc in Chinese brands",

Like countries with big brands (UK, France, Italy, Germany) usually have a lot of those on the street. As for other countries it is a mix but German are very popular because of reliability and consumption. I mean you see a lot of Ford and some Chevrolet but like Mustangs and Challengers are not common. Now you start seeing more Mustangs because Ford started to sell them there only like 5 years ago. Gas in Europe is also a little more expensive and muscle cars are not as efficient as other sports cars in that category. But imo above all is the price of buying in the US, shipping it there and get a license. When it\u2019s all said and done, you can get a high-end BMW or Mercedes for the same price\n\nThat being said I love american muscle cars",

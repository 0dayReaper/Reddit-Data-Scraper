Had I been a bit more alert when it started, I feel I would have felt more comfortable determining whether it was definitively gunshots that I was hearing . (That\u2019s why I asked here, I listened for sirens ab 10 min hoping maybe someone else who had heard better than I, might have already called.) As such, had I felt a bit more confident to say so with certainty, I would have called to request an officer on patrol to drive through the area. \nI almost called anyway, but I really couldn\u2019t distinguish what direction the sound had traveled to/from to provide an accurate report to the dispatcher. It seemed as though the direction was moving from close and loud to further away and fading, very much how I assume shots fired from a passing car might sound, which naturally, was concerning in and of itself. However, even more so, taking in to account that at the beginning of the semester, a local family had the front of their home hit by bullets from a passing car. The home was hit multiple times including front windows, exterior facade through into interior (including a bedroom where their 4 year old was sleeping) and shots fired into the front door narrowly missing an adult who had been sleeping and went to see where it was coming from before realizing the house itself was being hit. Most recently, (3 weeks ago) there were multiple reports of random late night, \u201crapid-fire\u201d shots with ricochet in Opelika\u2019s historic district/ nearby residential neighborhoods. I knew about the first incident the day after it occurred but I was not aware of the most recent reports of gunshots until yesterday.",

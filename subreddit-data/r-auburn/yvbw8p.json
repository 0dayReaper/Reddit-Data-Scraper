Quality is excellent and their prices have to changed even with inflation. The first time I ate there my gf and I left and just sat on my couch afterwards and reminisced about how good it was for the next hour. \n\nIt\u2019s been great every time I\u2019ve gone on Fridays, though I went once on a Thursday and it was good but not great. They may have a different chef working or something, I\u2019m not sure.",

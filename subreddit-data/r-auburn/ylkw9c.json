He sent a long winded email to everyone in his classes saying that he didn\u2019t want to leave but was being forced out, but didn\u2019t go into detail why. He also said that he really loved doing the Chem labs and loved his students like children lmao",

One of the Fortune 100 companies I worked for identified Auburn as one of the top 5 in the country.  The chemistry department ... not so much.  Although I worked in petrochemicals, I personally benefitted more from physics than I did chemistry.",

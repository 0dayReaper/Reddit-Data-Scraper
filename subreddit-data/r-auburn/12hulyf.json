    "postText": "Hey all! Just kinda scouting for what will be hard and what semesters I might wanna lighter load on. Here's a list to jog your memory (already finished some of these but wrote them for completeness):\n\n* ~~Chem 1, Physics 1,~~ Physics 2, ~~MATLAB~~\n* ~~Cal 1, Cal 2, Cal 3, Diff Eq,~~ Lin Algebra, Num Analysis\n* Statics, Mechanics of Materials, Thermo, Dynamics, Fundamentals Electrical Eng, \n* Aero Fundamentals, Aero 1, Aero Lab, Aero Systems\n* Aero 2, Flight Dynamics, Orbital Mechanics, Aero Structures 1\n* Aero 3, Aero Propulsion, Aero Structures 2, Aero/Space Design 1\n* Aero Structural Dynamics, Aero/Space Design 2\n\nI've read from another user that Aero Systems and Flight Dynamics are a lot; anyone else notice anything a lot harder or bigger work-load than the rest?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/12hulyf)",

Aero is specialized but the fundamentals of aerospace engineering require you to be a generalist in many aspects: controls, propulsion, fluids, structures, design. These skills are applicable in any engineering field. I\u2019ve had industrial steel and chemical plants send me offers for my work in structures at my past aero defense job. They don\u2019t care as long as you have relevant expertise. \n\nAn aerospace engineer who is doing structural analysis of aircraft structures can be and is hired at any company that needs a structural engineer. In aero structures we need to be cognizant of metal corrosion and protection, inspections, NDT, manufacturing methods, etc. you are literally working as a generalist in many aerospace jobs. I wish you all would stop saying this to people!",

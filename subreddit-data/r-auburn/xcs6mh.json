It\u2019s only going to get tougher from here (unless maybe you\u2019re an arts major that just struggles with numbers and financial concepts. but still, this man gives out old tests and barely changes them. you could not go to any classes and just study his old tests and make a B minimum.)",

A couple of my friends had him the same time as me and all our tests looked different. This class sucks and definitely does not determine how well you\u2019ll do in college. Pretty sure you can get a tutor through the University  http://academicsupport.auburn.edu/academic-support-home/study-partners-home/",

I'm not sure if other arts majors have to take macro, so maybe you are a business major?\n\nI think it is a good sign that you are reaching out for help, but the first exam is also the easiest.\n\nI guess it is also possible that you are not a native english speaker, which would make this type of class a little trickier (just based off examen, maybe thats a typo).",

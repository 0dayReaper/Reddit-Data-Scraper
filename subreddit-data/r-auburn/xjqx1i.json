Dub, riddim, hardstyle, experimental bass, and house are some of the genres I like and I was just wondering if there is any sort of edm scene around here and if any local DJ's do any shows.",

Moe\u2019s BBQ used to host a weekly edm night and it went hard but they stopped around the time Covid started and haven\u2019t done it since.",

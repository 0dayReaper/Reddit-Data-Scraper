I\u2019m looking at a 4 bed house in auburn for $345k, technically I can afford it but it\u2019s way too much of my salary so I need to try and supplement it with a roommate. \n\nWhat\u2019s a reasonable amount? I\u2019m literally paying $2050 a month at the current rates and all the apartments I see are $700+ unless you\u2019re in a complex that nobody really wants to live. \n\nIs $650 plus 1/2 utilities ok? I am thinking of saying they can use two rooms if they mainly use the 2nd as a kind of living room for them, I hate fighting over the tv in the living room with roommates, not saying they can\u2019t use it but the 2nd room would be theirs as a main replacement. \n\nAny suggestions?",

I would feel very hesitant to rent out a room to someone I have no relationship with unless there is an actual contract (for damages).\n\nIt might be a bit more difficult to find a roommate if your house is going to be further from campus. If you do end up renting a room, make sure to lay down some ground rules (kitchen usage/cleaning, having guests over, quiet(?) hours, etc.)",

My only advice would be to buy within your means. Don't live in a house you can only afford with roommates. The amount of stress probably won't be worth it.

    "postText": " Hello, I am hosting my second-ever tournament for league of legends and need players to fill up the roster. I would love to get as many people as we can be involved. Here is the basic information to help determine if you want to be in it:\n\n1. You must be ranked, and your current rank must be Gold 1 or lower.\n2. There will be 8 teams each with a Captain and Cocaptain. There will be 10 players to a team decided in a Draft Pick style that will determine what team you play for.\n3. You can bring friends to play, but there is a chance that you are drafted onto separate teams so if that is an issue, keep it in mind.\n4. Matches will begin on November 5th, with 2 happening Saturday and 2 Sunday. They will be live between 12 to 1 PM CST to 4 to 5 PM CST\n5. There will be matches every weekend up to the weekend of January 7th, with a break the weekend after Thanksgiving and the weekend before Christmas to observe the holiday.\n6. It will be a round-robin style tournament with each team playing the other once. Each match against a team will be a best of 3. The point goes to the winner of the best of 3.\n7. The team with the highest win rate at the end of the tournament will win.\n8. Every player is expected to pay a $1 entrance fee once teams are selected that will contribute to the prize pool for the winner. On top of that, I will be contributing $100 from the jump for the prize pool meaning the winning team will diver $100 + However much the entrance fee becomes across the whole team as a prize.\n9. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please DM me here. I also have an interest form that I would like everyone to fill out that I will include in our DMs\n10. Discord is required for the tournament.\n\nPlease reach out to me if you would be interested. I have ran one other tournament in the past and have learned a lot about logistics and planning. I hope we can have some fun games and see you on the rift!",

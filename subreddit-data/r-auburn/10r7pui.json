    "postText": "I recently graduated Auburn in December, but I cannot get hired anywhere! I don\u2019t move until August for grad school (not that I tell employers that) so I need a part time or full time job until then. I\u2019ve applied for a lot of jobs\u2014ranging from ones in my field and some just at a restaurant. Based on responses, I\u2019m either under qualified or over qualified for everything. I\u2019m doing UberEats but it\u2019s been real slow. Any suggestions on places that are hiring and pay at least $14/hr? I\u2019d do pretty much anything at this point.",

I've been there a year, and they've been able to work with my schedule fairly well. Many people there are students so you won't feel like an outlier. There's diferent departments, If you don't like the one you pick you can always transfer throughout the store. I have stayed in garden and enjoyed it for the most part.",

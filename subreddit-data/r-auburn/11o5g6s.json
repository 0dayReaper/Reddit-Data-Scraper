            "comment": "I graduated from there. It\u2019s a point based system and if you have enough points you could get in without having taken those classes yet. But you would have to take them along with the nursing classes by a certain semester. It would definitely add a strain to an already stressful time. Not impossible tho. \n\nI think the points are based off of ACT score, grades received in classes like anatomy, micro, your core classes, and maybe some other stuff I can\u2019t remember? I think I had like 40ish points when I got accepted. They give you a sheet to add up your points once you attended the enrollment meeting. If you have less than 35 odds are really slim. I think the average points is like 37. \n\nDon\u2019t quote me could be different now but it\u2019s something like that.",

Typically, it is around 35-40 that you need, but it changes each semester based on what the points are of the other people that apply. You should look into doing the concurrent program between AU and southern union, but to do that you have to have all the pre reqs for SU and AU program out of the way.",

If you end up moving before having worked your required time at the hospital that covers the tuition, just work that into your next hospital\u2019s offer that they just pay it off for you. Doing the concurrent program at AU adds another $15k to your cost and takes a little longer than just completing the ADN and working at EAMC. Most hospitals pay almost the same for ADN-RN and BSN-RN. The LPN pay is what is significantly less.",

If you don't mind working nights on medsurge then go for it. The only thing extending it is waiting to enroll into the ADN to take prerequisites, but for those who already have a bachelors, or all the prerequisites out of the way you are able to take ADN and BSN classes at the same time. I plan on moving. Just will wait a year after to stay for my SO to finish their masters at AU.",

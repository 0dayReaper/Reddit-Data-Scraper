I mean my parents are happy because I'm staying close to home and it's cheaper but I kinda feel like I made a mistake because UCLA is a great school I mean it's the #1 public school in the country and the opportunities post grad is endless over there. Plus Westwood is absolutely beautiful. Idk maybe I'm just letting others affect my thinking way too much and I'll admit that my enthusiasm about going to Auburn has been a bit down as of late",

Picking a grad school is important.  Don't dig yourself deeply in debt for undergrad studies if you have other options.  It makes no sense.",

She got involved in extra-curriculars, did well in her classes, and formed great relationships with her professors.\n\nShe went to the most prestigious school in the country in her field for grad school, met her husband there, and they\u2019ve built an enormously successful company in a very difficult field. (Nuclear engineering, they went to MIT.)\n\nCalifornia is overrated. It\u2019s a great place to build a business, don\u2019t get me wrong. It\u2019s beautiful too. But going to university in a college town is really fun; I think it\u2019s a lot more fun than it is in a city and I\u2019ve done both.\n\nBe happy that you don\u2019t have to incur that much debt (and California is EXPENSIVE), enjoy being close to home, and get involved, get to know your professors, and pursue grad school wherever you want after. \n\nIt\u2019s a great choice.\n\nEdit: oof. Film school? Dang, that\u2019s the one major I\u2019d probably say is worth going to UCLA. Idk what to say. Is there any way to still accept? If not, you could try transferring. If not, grad school or something else.\n\nIf you keep pursuing, you\u2019ll find a way. The most important thing- truly- is to keep your mind on the goal. You can do it if you really want it. Especially if you\u2019re talented enough to get in to UCLA in the first place. :)",

Being accepted to UCLA is awesome btw and I\u2019m sure the previous acceptance would be a good sign for transfer applications if you ever wanted to move out there after taking your first two years or so close to home. This way you would save loads on out of state tuition + cost of living in LA and at the end of the day your degree would still say it\u2019s from UCLA\n\nlike everything, there\u2019s ups and downs to every choice and while I\u2019m not gonna say that living in auburn could really beat LA in terms of social life\u2026 I would be surprised if you didn\u2019t find yourself enjoying your time here. School is School after all and Auburn has been a good one to me. I hope you enjoy your freshman year regardless of where you end up.",

There are so many stories of what being part of the \"Auburn Family\" is about, and so many successful people who started at Auburn. Of course, UCLA is a great school especially if you are interested in the film industry, but personally I believe that has more to being located so close to Hollywood.  However, Atlanta has begun developing a large film industry also, so maybe proximity will begin to build more local programs for the closer colleges. You could always transfer later once you get your core classes done, however if you are like me you will love Auburn and decide to finish there. I am a firm believer in that the selection of your school does not have much impact on your future career other than possible connections after you graduate. It is what you do after you graduate that matters most. Auburn was not considered a basketball school when Charles Barkley attended, but look at him now. He was not highly recruited coming out of high school, but he started getting recognized at Auburn and then shined in the pros.",

In 4-5 years, would you rather have a degree from UCLA and 4-5 years of experience and networking opportunities within Hollywood or a degree from Auburn University?

Not enough diversity, food choices, culture or fun activities. People are always nice enough but not kind. Sad to say &amp; maybe I got VERY unlucky, but almost every person I had to regularly interact with were absolutely horrible. Close minded and inconsiderate. Not the best for ethnic minorities. Idk how close to home you\u2019re staying, but maybe you\u2019re already used to how it is there.\n\nSaving money for school is great tho! I graduated debt free and could never imagine being in debt for a bachelors degree. I just moved to SoCal and paying triple the rent in Auburn. There are way more scholarships/resources for bachelors vs post 2nd-ed. You\u2019ve made the more financially responsible decision and good luck to you!",

I recently spoke to someone in industry out in LA and they told me that television shows are almost exclusively being filmed through Georgia production companies because its so hard to get studio time in California.\n\nAlso, it is easy for a new student to get caught up in the importance of the degree. There are definitely networking benefits to going to somewhere like UCLA but, from what I understand about the industry, nepotism is a real thing. Much of the \"networking\" happens because you have parents or relatives already established in the industry. Going to UCLA is just a cherry on top, and the networking opportunities may not be worth the debt you would accumulate going to UCLA.\n\nI have a close friend who started as a camera operator and was recently asked to direct a feature film. He did this through building his personal network without having gone to film school at all. \n\nIt is your life, and you should live it how you want, but I recommend double majoring in film and something like accounting, marketing, or business analytics at Auburn. Auburn has a great business school and the film industry is extremely feast or famine. If you are interested in working in film, it might not be a bad idea to have something more \"reliable\" to fall back on if you can't break through. Building options in college is more important then the technical aspect because, and this is just a hunch, I feel the most important lessons in the film industry come from time in the industry, not a classroom. Also, production companies need accountants as much as they need cinematographers.\n\nAlso, if you don't feel comfortable with you decision after spending a semester/year on The Plains, you can always transfer back to UCLA.\n\nWar Eagle!",

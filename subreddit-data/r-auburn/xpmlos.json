Just around the main part is ~3 miles with some additions you can get up to like 6 or 7 with additions.\n\nTrail running, there\u2019s always Chewacla. \n\nFor longer routes, Ive found that running down Glenn -&gt; University -&gt; Moore\u2019s Mill -&gt; Samford -&gt; Gay is fun. That\u2019s about 6ish miles, plus additions like winding through neighborhoods or up into campus.",

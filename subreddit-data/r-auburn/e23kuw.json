You've got a native-born female that had a lot of local friends and relatively local relatives with a wide social influence and a foreign-born male with no semi-local family that I'm aware of and the foreign Asian communities in Auburn tend to keep to themselves or at least be reserved socially. I do hope more comes out as they investigate his disappearance and death, but I'm also afraid there may be a lack of evidence with Lai Chih-kai, unlike with Aniah. Lai also hadn't really been here long before he disappeared (about 3 weeks), and as far as I'm aware, no arrests have been made.",

It's fathomable that someone like that might seclude themselves then unintentionally die from exposure/starvation/malnutrition. It happens to the homeless on a regular basis. This is why it's important for our local community to build relationships with the international student community.  You might not be able to imagine all the stresses they are going through, but you sure can cook em' a meal and give them a place to feel at rest. Consider volunteering at one of the many international student outreach programs across our city. There are plenty to chose from.",

Aniah's mom was all over social media from the first day she was missing and the story was being shared through mutual friends. Everybody saw it and heard about it because the parents are in Alabama and they pushed the story through their contacts and connections. It doesn't hurt that her step-father is UFC famous. It made the news as much as it did because people were already talking about it.  \nNow the story is getting more press because it was (probably) a violent crime. A random crime. Three people have been arrested for it. By comparison, the exchange student seems to have died by his own hand or by accident and not at the hands of a random monster. There's no grainy convenience store footage or blood-filled car found abandoned.",

That really is sad on what happened to him. \nThe news would rather print news stories that will get viewers and people would rather hear about a woman who disappeared and/or found dead. There are many angles to stories like that.",

Nobody heard about the fisheries professor who shot herself this summer, or the grad student who was stabbed at sky bar a few months ago, or even the shooting downtown before the Georgia game. The university likes to depict Auburn as this safe little college town, but plenty of sketchy stuff goes on. Aniah's story blew up primarily because of her parents. I doubt it would have gotten as much attention if they hadn't been all over social media trying to raise awareness that she was missing.",

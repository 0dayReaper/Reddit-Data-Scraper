We\u2019re failing to coach character. Our goal is to win. Winning is cool but coaching life long character is the reason why other schools are outperforming us in culture. Deion sanders can see the politics from a mile away. Not too many coaches will agree to be on this hot seat.",

We had some good players that never hit the field when I was a student and player. Great coaches coach character not football that\u2019s all im saying. D\u2019haquille Williams, Isaiah Crowell (uga) , Nick Marshall, Nick Fairley, etc are good friends of mine. You have to be able to maintain character no matter the talent level god blesses you with. On a random note I think Deion can tame ego.",

You make them better decision makers off and on the field. I remember going to spring break bama just won the natty. Auburn players were wasted none of the bama players would drink. When you have a vision in your head and your addicted to it, character keeps you out of all the bs and one or two mess ups don\u2019t matter anymore long as they aren\u2019t huge.",

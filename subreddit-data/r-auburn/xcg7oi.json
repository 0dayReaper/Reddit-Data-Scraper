    "postText": "I won\u2019t be in town for the game, just watching at home. But I always like to honor our opponents by cooking up some of the known local culture foods of our opponents.\n\nFor example, when Penn State plays Maryland, I\u2019d probably make crab cakes or a plate of crabby fries with plenty of Old Bay. We played Ohio on Saturday, and since they are from the city of Athens, I went Greek and made gyros. I think you can see the patterns here.\n\nI\u2019ve never really thought about what true \u201cAlabama\u201d food is\u2026 was thinking about making an \u00e9touff\u00e9e for the game Saturday but my lady thinks that\u2019s way more Louisiana/Cajun. Can\u2019t say I disagree - I do love me some \u00e9touff\u00e9e over rice though.\n\nSo help me out, how can I pay tribute to our good friends from Auburn this weekend in the kitchen?\n\nGood luck this weekend too! It was a blast to host you all here last year and I wish I could have swung the visit to Jordan-Hare. You guys definitely have our number and I\u2019m expecting it to be a battle!",

You could get away with it if we were Mississippi hahahaha\n\nSo, speaking as someone who has had to cook for a lot of different southeastern cuisines, I can say unequivocally what you need is smoked chicken and white sauce. If you have the time and a good grill set up, what you REALLY want to do is Drunk Chicken: https://www.fieldandflower.co.uk/recipes/chicken/beer-can-chicken-with-alabama-sauce\n\nany time you play a southern team, if they aren\u2019t primarily known for their coast like florida or louisiana, if you don\u2019t know what to do, look up a local barbecue recipe. We have all our different cooking methods and sauces and we love arguing about them, even the Carolinas don\u2019t always agree and their sauce is gold :)",

White sauce is the stereotypical Alabama sauce, but it's from North Alabama and you can find plenty of people in Alabama who haven't had it. Less so today since it's served barbecue chains and even bottled in some grocery stores (Duke's mayo makes one).\n\nYou might not find it in the store in Pennsylvania, but you can make it at home easily. I prefer mustard or vinegar based sauces.\n\nBoiled peanuts are a good option. If you can't buy raw green peanuts, you can make them with dried but not roasted ones. People say you can make them out of roasted peanuts, but I don't really agree and also you can just buy them already made and canned.\n\nGolden Flake potato chips are made in Alabama. You probably can't get Golden Flake in Pennsylvania, but you can definitely get Utz. See if you can find dill pickle flavor.",

Slice the sausage into rounds.  or you can slice them half longways and then slice half round pieces.  Brown them, then add the white beans and the seasoned greens and the broth.  Fix the cornbread \"southern style\" according to the package.  You will have a great soup that will be one of your favorites for years to come.  Or, just fix some ribs or fried chicken with YELLOW potato salad - that is a must-have (yellow).\n\nAlso - serve with lemonade - Toomers Corners - where they rolls the oaks has the best lemonade!",

I'd say something closer to etouffee, jambalaya, seafood, stew, some sort of beans and cornbread, or soul food for me. We've got a lot of Cajuns here, although, the food may not have originated here. Another specialty would be prime rib with chimichurri, the sauce isn't native to here, but we make it at my house all the time. Bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers, cowboy beans, smoked mac'n cheese, and cream corn casserole are a must. If you must do BBQ, then smoked chicken with white sauce and sticky honey ribs.\n\nYou could smoke a spiral cut ham and make great ham and cheese melts, too.",

From befriending the residents form a property close to campus and my own which was a mile or so away, living \"walking distance\" is really not worth it.\n\nFor one, the apartments get smaller, shittier, and more expensive the closer you get. The community and amenities get more sparse and run down as well. I was told when working for a property VERY close to logan square that the \"sales dynamic\" is different than what I'm used to.\n\nYou will get many parents and students that are touring the property as a formality and they already know that is where they will be renting because they think they need to be \"walking distance\" and that's where their parents stayed. \n\nThe walking distance sales point is probably the silliest, while totally true, the transit still picks up there any you will find very quickly a free, nicely climate controlled bus ride where you can play on your phone is preferable to a 1 mile walk up and down hills in the morning heat or winter cold.\n\nAlmost everyone takes the bus, so, does it matter that you could walk if you wanted to?",

The best maintenance request I would put in was when my light fixture in my bathroom would fill up with water. It happened a few times. They never fixed it they would just dump the water out and put it back on the light. I was unaware electricity and water go well together\u2026 oh also would they would come \u201ctreat\u201d my unit for mold they would literally spray painted over it and it would come back through a few weeks later.

We never saw our deposit.\n\nThe second place we got the AC was awful, the house had some water damage in walls but not sure where it was coming from-I think it was old pipes collapsing. We had black mold in all the areas that connected to the bathrooms and the AC would regularly mess up and water would build up and it went down hallway and into the walls. They came to \"fix\" the water issue, the walls were still cracking, they did not paint anything after they were done, they left cardboard and duct tape covering some of the areas they cut into to find the leaks from the hot water heater this time. The baseboards had a growth on them, I was told to just bleach them. The carpets were old, the house was old, I would not use the dishwasher at all. I discovered black mold in my bathroom under the sink(I quit storing stuff there because it was leaky). The pipes had rust, I overheard the worker repairing my hall bath say the pipes were starting to crumble. Roots were growing into the plumbing lines going to the street, so the toilets did not want to flush properly.  I was so glad to be out. We just got tired of making reports only to have them half way fix things. Still awaiting if we get our deposit back.\n\nDo not resign and start looking for a new place. Different agencies do different move in times, and with new places opening up, you may be able to move without being homeless. Save some extra money and put aside for yourself if you need to pay both rents for a month.  If you can't do that, get a storage unit asap to store your stuff while you couch surf.",

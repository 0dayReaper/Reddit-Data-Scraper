    "postText": "I went to Auburn long ago, and I have some real wtf memories about this anti-abortion rally that was held in that main E-W aisle. \n\nThere were full-size billboards (have you ever seen a highway billboard on the ground by a 2-story building?) of dead full-term babies and graphically altered images of legitimately aborted fetuses. Just gross propaganda that was clearly not factual even to someone who hadn\u2019t seen it.\n\nIt was something I\u2019d never seen before, and despite the conservative nature of the state I got the vibe that I wasn\u2019t the only one who was uncomfortable.\n\nPerhaps no coincidence I transferred out after a year despite making some great friends who individually shared my values.\n\nI miss the campus, and when I\u2019ve found myself nearby I check out the red brick. This isn\u2019t a hate post, but there were some things I saw there that didn\u2019t sit right with me then and that I find pretty abhorrent now, knowing they weren\u2019t student-led efforts.\n\nJust wondering if anyone remembers this and if it\u2019s still happening and tolerated.",

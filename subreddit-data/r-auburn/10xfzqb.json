The shuttles always brake near the railroad crossing and open their doors although they cannot take or drop students (because there are no stops). Has anyone also noticed this ? Why do you think they do that?",

We're you not taught the same in drivers' education? Trains are BIG machines that cannot stop on a dime, will crush anything and anyone in its path, and may derail as result of striking something or someone.",

But I think it was pretty cool, I met my girlfriend there but in the couple years I used it before that I never found anything serious, but I  honestly wasn\u2019t really looking for that and I got the vibe 80% of people on there weren\u2019t either. Met some nice ladies though! It definitely seems to be a pretty popular choice around here, even though you\u2019re unlikely to find something serious",

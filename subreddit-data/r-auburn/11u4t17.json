Those roads aren't made to handle more than light traffic and would just make getting around even more of a disaster. \n\nMAYBE it would work for a block around roomers, but businesses downtown would be very against it since there would be little to no direct access\n\nGameDay basically has its own traffic rules anyway. Tbh traffic is usually not that bad downtown on GameDay because people are tailgating and can't park there anyway. After games you already can't drive there \n\n\nThe problem isn't the roads, it's the city rezoning to put giant stores like a Publix and target on an already over capacity area instead of smaller shops/restaurants in the space. Those roads could barely handle day to day traffic and now there's two giant traffic creators next to each other downtown.",

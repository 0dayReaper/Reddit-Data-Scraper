I\u2019ve been thinking about getting a loft bed that way I can have a desk underneath it but looking through the photos it\u2019s kinda hard to tell how tall the ceilings are. Do you think a 6ft guy could fit comfortably with one?",

But yeah I\u2019m still open to looking and actually seeing first hand the places",

What didn\u2019t you like about Dexter and Neil?",

I was able to touch ceilings with tiptoeing but that didn\u2019t really bother me much. \n\nHowever, they have pretty thin walls in between each units. I didn\u2019t like that part. \n\nDexter/Neil house has desks attached to the unit and it\u2019s big enough for one person. There\u2019s also a semi wall that separated your desk area and kitchen area so that was nice. If you live nearby, you should sign up for the tour. Hope this helps",

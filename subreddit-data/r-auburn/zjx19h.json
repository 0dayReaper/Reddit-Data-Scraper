I was asking because last spring semester, a couple of buddies and I drove to Taco Bell at about 8 or 9 pm (I don't really remember because I had too much to drink) and I got the surpreme burrito. I don\u00b4t normally order this burrito, but I wanted to try out something different and my drunk mind could'nt resist the temptation. I took one bite and realized that the staff actually gave me a burrito with beans in it. I don\\`t trust Taco Bell bean products so I walked into the store and asked for a surpreme burrito. I remembered that I actually spilled some hot sauce on myself while trying to unwrap it too, so it was quite embarassing to demand for another burrito. So there I was, hot sauce over my hoodie, with a burrito and a half in my hand at 9 pm in Taco Bell. At this point I was no longer hungry so I figured that the best option for my extra burrito was to throw it onto one of those houses in that area. So, I'm sorry if anyone woke up that morning and saw  beans splashed on one of the sides of their house.",

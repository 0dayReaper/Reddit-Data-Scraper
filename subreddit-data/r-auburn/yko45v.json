    "postText": "I'm curious if there are places regarding spirituality around Auburn, specifically LGBTQ+ friendly. I want to poke around different faiths/practices and get a feel for gow they operate and what the faith is actually like. Google can only tell you so much. I have a particukar interest in paganism and know there used to be a Pagan church around here, but it looks like they closed in 2019. Any faith is good though as long as it isn't Jehovah's, LDS, Southern Baptist, or any others that are typically closed-minded and anti-LGBTQ+.",

Even if you don't find what you're looking for there will probably be people there who can point you in the right direction. Also, there is the Universalist Church in Camp Hill that is LGBTQ+ friendly. \n\nI hope you find what you're searching for.",

            "comment": "\"Anything is good except religions that are specifically anti lgbtq fundamentally\" Would have been the simplest way to say what you're really trying to. Cuz this isn't about them being closeminded, this is about you implying that them breaking their rules, that goes against the very nature of their religion, makes them closed minded. Which is pretty messed up since you don't believe in them anyway but you want to hop around for fun. No religion should feel the need to break rules because of outside pressures, which has already been happening. If enough people don't believe in them they will fade from existence naturally anyway and if you don't follow the religion anyway and you're just looking around out of interest then avoiding them just cuz of that, actually makes you the close minded one",

    "postText": "**edited to add** I will make ~$60k this coming up year as a first year resident and around the same if I do another year of residency. After that I will make around $130-150k/ year. \n\n\nIm a 4th year pharmacy student (8years college total) about to starting a post-grad training residency. My husband and I are making plan to tackle my student loans. I have a lot (~$225k). I had no financial help throughout college with the exception of a few small scholarships and worked full time in undergrad which obviously still isn\u2019t enough to support yourself in auburn off ~$12/hr. \n\nCan anyone provide me any advice and share info about yours and what you did/going to do? It would be helpful if you don\u2019t mind sharing:\n\nHow much student loan debt do you have?\n\nWhich type of loans did you start paying off first?\n\nHow aggressive were you with paying them off/ how much monthly payments?\n\nWhat\u2019s your salary?\n\nWas there any delay that caused you to defer such as post-grad training, etc?",

It\u2019s gonna be like college never ended but it will be worth it in the long run. It\u2019s going to be hard because most of your classmates are probably gonna buy a nice new bmw when they graduate. If you and your husband dump a majority of your combined income at these loans, you could get rid of these loans in less than 10 years, maybe 5 if you\u2019re really disciplined.",

You need to consciously make the decision to live as if you make 50K per year, not 150K.\n\nWord of advise, contribute atleast 20K per year to a tax deferred savings account even though you\u2019re trying to rapidly pay off your loans.  Do not delay your retirement savings.  Also, build an emergency savings fund right off the bat, I\u2019d say 5K - 10K depending on your living situation (factor in cost of living in your area, medical bills, etc.) I also think you could afford a small travel fund for an occasional modest trip.  All work and no play can have a pretty negative effect on your mental health after a while.\n\nAfter that, every extra cent you make should go to your students loans.  Good luck!",

She finished school in 2008 and got her first job making $125,00 a year slinging pills in a retail pharmacy.  It took me about 2 years to convince her to attack the debt. Once I convinced her, We aggressively paid down her loans and also flipped a condo (made a quick 70k)  to completely pay them off in about six years before we started having kids.  Her loans were about $1,600 a month and we traded those out for $2,000 a month in daycare!  \n\nMy advice is to live very simply and attack the shit out of the debt.  Don\u2019t make any large purchases or have kids until the debt is gone or you will be financially fucked for the next 20+ years!",

My child (3rd year pre-med) has about 10K total debt.  I assume you are paying out of state tuition, even after 4 years?  Can you not establish residency to get in-state tuition?\n\nGenerally, pay off the highest interest rates first.  Use a student loan payment calculator to estimate your prepayment loans.  A simple model of $225K at 4.5% for 10 years would require payments of $2331/month.  Basically, that's a mortgage payment for 10 years.\n\nI'm not trying to discourage  you but you need to know what your debt status looks like. If you add on another $200K for the last 4 years it will be challenging.  I know someone in NC who is making $90K a year working as a pharmacist but she has years of experience.  Hope this gives some useful info.\n\n[https://www.calculator.net/student-loan-calculator.html?cloanamount1=225000&amp;cloanterm1=10&amp;cinterestrate1=4.5&amp;cmonthlypay1=&amp;ctype=1&amp;x=59&amp;y=26#general](https://www.calculator.net/student-loan-calculator.html?cloanamount1=225000&amp;cloanterm1=10&amp;cinterestrate1=4.5&amp;cmonthlypay1=&amp;ctype=1&amp;x=59&amp;y=26#general)",

I assume my child in pre-med will graduate with a similar amount of debt once med school is completed.  \n\nI don't understand how the cost of education has skyrocketed in the last 40 years.  I paid $240 a quarter for tuition at Auburn in 1982.  $240 in 1982 would equate to $750 in 2023 based on an annual 2.85% inflation for a total of 212.78% over the 41 years.

            "comment": "I graduated two years ago. Issues I see with your situation right away\n\n1. Overestimating your starting salary- you won't make 140k at a hospital as a clinical pharmacist starting out unless you move to HCOL like New York or Cali. And then you can't afford that due to your loan burden. Maybe you'll get to that with COLA after a few years or a promotion in a few years. I'd be conservative and say 120k starting out, if you're lucky\n\n2. Overestimating residency pay- unless something changes within the last two years, I'd not expect over 50k. 60k is an amazing resident salary, even inflation adjusted\n\n3. Your interest will begin stacking again in July when freeze ends. Delaying another year for residency will be horribly painful\n\n4. My personal belief is that clinical based pharmacist residencies will be redundant in only a few years. I use chatGPT at work, it can already do everything a clinical pharmacist can. \n\nI don't want to tell you to drop the residency. But I'd really encourage you to look into business admin, robotics, programming, and supply chain as these will be the things that matter for pharmacists in a few years. Auburn has done a cool experiment with this clinical pharmacist focus, unfortunately computers have literally destroyed any need for it.\n\nSource: graduated 2 years ago, make 140k as inpatient hospital pharmacist and much of this is from shift differential. Base guaranteed pay is only 125k. Base. Clinical pharmacist pay is 130k from what my colleagues say after a few years\n\nLoan burden: 90k. Can pay it all off as soon as the freeze ends, not been paying because I've had it gaining interests in anticipation. Work also may pay it off\n\nPlease DM me if you want, I think I have good suggestions. Know a few programs that can get your debt completely forgiven too at no tax or cost to you (example EDRP with the federal government)",

I've noticed they haven't been open for a while now, and today one of their clients came into my shop to ask because she had an appointment and they didn't contact her, and she said their line was disconnected. Maybe they simply went out of business, but there is no sign so I'm sort of worried about them. I was just wondering if anyone knew if they are alright.",

I've never been (cut and dye my own) so I couldn't honestly say how good/bad. The lady said they'd been here for years though.",

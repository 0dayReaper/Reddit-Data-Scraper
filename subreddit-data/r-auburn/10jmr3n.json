We will be meeting 2 or 3 times a week (depending on the group you choose) for 20-30 minutes for a morning warm up. We will be teaching simple, easy exercises you can do at home without equipment in order to get started on your self-improvement. Attendance, motivation, and advice is free (unless you decide you want the book we will be working out of which is $14). All fitness levels are welcome. DM me for questions and details.",

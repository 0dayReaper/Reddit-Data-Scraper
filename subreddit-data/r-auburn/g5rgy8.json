    "postText": "I have zero motivation and haven\u2019t learned a thing in any of my classes since the switch. I\u2019m taking linear algebra (an upper level math) right now and my professor is like 85 years old and has literally just been reading pages from the book since this shit started. Usually he would write on a blackboard, actually teach the content, give examples, but not anymore. I made a 25 on the last test. The class was already hard enough but putting it online was a huge mistake. I feel awful now and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m even passing anymore, but I wouldn\u2019t know since he doesn\u2019t put anything on canvas. I\u2019ve had one professor pretty much just give up and the others are making the classes even more difficult. Ugh this is terrible",

I'm still not sure how I passed, actually.\n\nThere is a book publisher that I like because they sell older books that are (allegedly) really good, and they're inexpensive. I actually bought a calculus book from them about a week ago, and I have no reason to know calculus anymore. I like books, though.... That said, *Linear Algebra* by Georgi Shilov and *Matrices and Linear Algebra* by Hans Schneider both have a Kindle version on Amazon and they're both well reviewed. Maybe those could help. \n\nI know it's not ideal, and I get that online classes suck--I've been there. Hopefully these things can be useful.",

Every question (10) had the same weight (3 points). Definitely know how to diagonalize a matrix and the gram-schmidt method. That one problem was the longest problem on the final and took the majority of the time. The other questions were very similar to questions from the previous tests i.e. putting a matrix in rref, finding kernel/range, finding a basis for a matrix/matrix representation under different basis. In the past, he let us bring a handwritten formula sheet to class for the final, so a good review that helped was writing those out so you can refresh on some of the earlier chapters. I also had him for diffEQ and there were 33 points possible but graded out of 30 points, as this was his method of scaling the class. Our linear algebra final didn't have a scale, but he might give you guys one considering the circumstances-just count how many points there are total. Good luck on your finals!",

He'll always use lectures to go over homework-do not skip these. These are critical because the test questions will be very similar to his hw problems and review. If you have time, make sure to skim through the hw and ask questions on it. He'll always ask the class what problems you want to see worked, so if you see a difficult problem or a problem you think will be on the test, be sure to ask him to work it. Don't skip class. He gives up to 5% bonus to your final grade if you have perfect attendance. Honestly, a day or 2 before every test, I'd just rework and read through the sections that are being tested on/the homework he reviewed, and I did fine. He'll also allow you to use a calculator on the exams, so bring one so you don't goof up simple calculations.",

It's like if you hire a person to repair your roof. You paid that person the money to do it so you expect the person to do it, not give you a box of nails, a YouTube instruction video, and a hammer to tell you to go do the job by yourself. Plus added to that, the math department at Auburn has a large amount of professors that don't teach. They hired a retired professor last year to teach cal 2 because they didn't have enough professors and all he did was sit there and talk about his life. Some of us don't have the extra time to be able to teach ourselves. Added on, when none of us signed up for online classes, it just adds onto the inconvenience. We didn't sign up to get online instruction. We didn't pay $800+ in student services fees to not be able to use the services but we're all having to deal with it so just let us complain. It's better than bottling it up",

That thread (which I didn't save, sorry) was  more about people from all over the country sharing resources they had found to teach themselves undergrad math reqs. Math teachers not teaching is kind of the cost of doing business for future engineers. It's also good training for having a boss who doesn't give a shit about you.",

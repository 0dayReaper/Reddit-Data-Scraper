Here\u2019s a quick rundown of stuff I\u2019m aware of: Pride on the Plains is our local LGBTQIA+ organization that primarily focuses on running monthly events and a yearly Pridefest in June. http://www.prideontheplains.com https://www.facebook.com/prideontheplains\n\nThe Mizfits is the local drag group, They run weekly shows typically at Crown of Comedy in Auburn, and Sneak and Dawdle in Opelika. Their shows (And other queer events) get posted to this facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/AOQueerLife\n\nThere\u2019s no local LGBT Clubs or bars, but Coffee Mafia is a local coffee shop whos a massive supporter of of Pride on the Plains and the local community. The owner, Ian is also a drag queen. They host local craft shows and a monthly poetry reading night too! I highly recommend getting an \u201cIced Crack\u201d which is their coldbrew drink. https://auburncoffeemafia.com/ https://www.facebook.com/auburncoffeemafia/\n\nIf your a student or involved in the University at all, There\u2019s the office of Diversity and Inclusion which is getting ready to open a Pride Center in Haley, and there\u2019s 2 oncampus organisations: Spectrum and oSTEM.",

Not sure if it\u2019s open but I heard about it last semester. Everyone I spoke to there is super cool &amp; they\u2019re really open &amp; accepting of everyone! \ud83d\udc96",

AUUF itself is a very inclusive community for people who aren\u2019t the \u201ctypical Auburn crowd\u201d, and very welcoming regardless of your religious persuasion.",

    "postText": "I'm almost finished with my classes at Southern Union planning to go to Auburn soon attending the Business School for a Business Analytics major and Computer Science minor. My question is, are there students in their 30's at the university? I'm getting close to 30 and may graduate at 32. I hope I'm not left out. I got three more classes at Southern Union which is financial and managerial accounting and business statistics I.",

You do you, you will be older than most in your class but transferring in as a Junior vs a Freshman means you are dealing with a more mature cohort, most won\u2019t have time to worry about your age. I wouldn\u2019t overthink it and just roll with it and get your degree on your own time.",

Most of us are too stressed about our own academics to ever think about it, and when we do, I think you\u2019ll find that like others have said, it won\u2019t make a difference in making connections, friends, study groups etc. There\u2019s an inherent respect even for people that go back to college or go to college late, I think most of us realize that it takes a lot more effort and commitment that route than going right after high school.",

Grad school students range from 22-28, and there's plenty of mature people in those age groups (and younger, even)\n\nDon't worry about sticking out. You may want to go to church or something to meet some older people as well. One option for this is city of Auburn recreation--they have things like a bridge club, board game club, etc",

I dunno if the business school has it, but the Engineering school has transfer specific Engineering Orientation  sections and events! Be sure to try and get involved in clubs and activities you like!",

My experience as an intern student had been decent. I've made friends during classes and haven't felt like an outcast when it comes to group work or study groups.",

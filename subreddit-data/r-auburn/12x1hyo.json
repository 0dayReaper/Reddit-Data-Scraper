Gentry drive and the Drake areas are the most dangerous places in town. Chewacla State Park is fun go to with friends when the weather is pleasant. I also recommend going to Food truck Friday's in downtown Opelika.",

For my coffee taste, they have the best quality product and service. If you\u2019re looking for anything Starbucks-adjacent, they are not for you tho.",

There\u2019s a coffee bodega there that\u2019s a spin-off of Momma Mocha\u2019s. Record shop, art gallery, pinball place that has live music on fridays, lots of cool restaurants, bars, breweries \u2014 John emerald distillery is my personal favorite. Also, Town Creek market (in Auburn) mostly runs through the summer, but if you\u2019ll be here by august check that out Saturday mornings. Chewacla and Kreher Ecology Preserve; Kiesel Park if you have any pups",

Ross House on Ross Street has cozy vibes if you\u2019re trying to get work done, but my favorite is Coffee Mafia. They have pretty okay espresso drinks and lots of different syrup flavors if you\u2019re into that",

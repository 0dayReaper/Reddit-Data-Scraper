I don\u2019t know anybody that has gone to auburn but def want to know student opinions. I was wondering if anybody could comment on their experiences in the college of engineering and if they recommend it (workload, difficulty, professors, students,  anything really). Curious to hear from any girls enrolled as well. Thanks sm",

Like any school,  some profs are friendly some are A-holes.\n\nIF you are doing well,  the school of engineering will award you with more scholarships starting your Jr year.\n\nHave you been to campus?  If not you should visit. Even if you decide to go elsewhere.   Auburn campus is beautiful and the people are great.",

            "comment": "Im a senior in Aerospace finishing my last semester, and all I can say is you\u2019re going to have to stay on top of things with little room to fall behind. The science and engineering in the program is honestly not that hard to learn, and there are only so many textbooks that teach aerospace so you can easily find anything you need to study, but real issue I have with Auburn\u2019s aerospace program is the sheer amount of work you will have to complete to stay afloat. Some classes expect anywhere up to 8 hours extra a week for homework/projects, especially in 2 classes: Aero Systems and Flight Dynamics, both of which are sophomore/junior level classes. (also Propulsion, but seemingly only with Dr. Hartfield. My last week of Props had 4 massive assignments due BEFORE finals.) When I went through those classes, it was countless nights in the library fiddling with MATLAB/Python and doing oogles and boogles of hand math. But I believe both of the professors i had will not be teaching them anymore so who know, maybe things get better.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re going into aerospace, make sure you really REALLY love it. I thought I liked it a lot going into college, but now I am experiencing extreme burnout on top of really questioning if i like AEROSPACE engineering or if I like engineering and also airplanes are cool.",

I\u2019ve had awesome aerospace professors (Dr. Melnick!), and the bad ones are usually just too smart for their own good and struggle to teach effectively. The difficulty and workload really is up to you - if you put in the effort then you will be fine. You\u2019ll make friends fast because working together with other aero kids will be very important, and all the people I\u2019ve met in major are awesome - auburn men and women are the finest, after all. Where ever you do aerospace tho, I would recommend getting comfortable with matlab or python on your own - it\u2019s used so much sophomore year and beyond, and the professors will assume you know how to use it already. If you are already good at you\u2019ll be wayyyy ahead. Good luck and hope you make a decision that works for you!",

            "comment": "Been there, done that... many years ago.  I will tell you from experience that Aerospace is a niche major and the industry is feast or famine, heavily depending on the MIC.  \n\nIf I had to do it over again, I would either go Computer Science or Mechanical.  Chemical and Electrical are good alternatives if you are good at it, but those were not my forte.  Lots of jobs to be had with CS, ME, CE or EE degrees.  These are MUCH more generic degrees that can be applied across almost all industries.  Aerospace is pretty limited by comparison.  Look at sheer number of jobs by degree/major.  Most of the others blow Aerospace out of the water.    \n\nI'm glad I went to Auburn, and Aerospace is a sexy degree to be sure.  But I strongly urge you to change to something else now.  If you are really really REALLY into it, and can't live without it, see about getting it as a minor or a double major instead.  Don't put all your eggs in the Aerospace basket.  \n\nGood luck from a former AE",

From my observations,  he attacked his studies with due diligence when had time to \"play\", he made the most of it. In short, he enjoyed every minute of his 4 yrs and wouldn't change a thing. Not much but a hint that rewards will come plenty fold if consistent with your goal. Good luck!",

I went to a big ten school before and it was alright.\n\nIf you gonna take out a student loan, go wherever is the cheapest.\n\nIf you plan on going to grad school and doing research, TAMU and Purdue are the best options. We are good, but they have way more money and resource than us\u2026\u2026\n\nWorkload at auburn? Depends on whom you have. Some professors are demanding and some are not. It\u2019s a challenge for sure.",

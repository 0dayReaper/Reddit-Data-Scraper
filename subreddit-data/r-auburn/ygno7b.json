    "postText": "so i currently live in georgia and i go to ung. i\u2019ve got 30 hours and i\u2019m majoring in kinesiology. for my exercise science focus, i\u2019ll probably be in college for a total of 6 years. if i do end up going to auburn this will be my last year at ung. i want to know if it\u2019s worth it to move to auburn for a year and just work so i can save some money and get in state tuition. mathematically speaking i\u2019ll be paying 11k instead of 31k for 4 years so i\u2019ll be saving roughly 80k.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: something i didn\u2019t specify is that i go to a local campus of ung and i\u2019m going to have to transfer to the main campus or auburn next year. my brother lives about 15 minutes away from ung\u2019s main campus so if i go that route i can live with him rent free (still gotta buy groceries) and i can just drive to school every day\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit 2: i made this post last night before i had a come to jesus meeting with myself. i\u2019ve decided that if i go to auburn i won\u2019t get my masters there id go elsewhere (unless it\u2019s the best or cheapest option, i need to do more research). getting my masters there would be much more work so i wouldn\u2019t have near the time i\u2019d like to experience being an auburn tiger.",

One was they sat him in front of a computer and showed him different images/videos and he had to answer how they affected his desire to smoke. That's basically all that was. The second sessions was some type of brain scan. They put electrodes to his head and measured waves.. that's all I remember. I can't do it because I can't do the second session.",

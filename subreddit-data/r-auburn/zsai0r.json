At least once a month you should drive it around till it gets up to operating temp and the tires have a chance to warm up. \n\nIf you've left it sitting for 6 months without starting, bring a battery charger with you. If it's an older battery, the upcoming frigid weather has a good chance of zapping it completely. Before starting it up completely, remove the fuel pump fuse and turn it over for 5-10 seconds. This will get oil pumping to all the passageways. Reinsert the fuse then take it for a drive. It would be a good idea to get the oil changed, fill up with at least mid grade gas, and ensure your tires are inflated properly.",

How has no one that works for the city thought of making this change? I hate turning left on Gay St and you would think that it would be a lot easier with a light there.",

Just gotta watch out for what is essentially one-way traffic because everyone parks on the street. Left onto Gay from Samford is such a shitty intersection. Though, they did finally add a turn arrow at Opelika Road and Ross after many years. I will keep hope that they do the same here when they install the lights onto the new poles.",

I get it\u2019s only 3 way traffic, but I\u2019ve sat through 3 light changes before trying to make that left onto Opelika because that right turn lane in the opposite direction is just a constant stream of cars",

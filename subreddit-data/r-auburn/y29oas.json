    "postText": "According to Auburn police, a suspect is in custody after a hostage situation on Ogletree Road.\n\nAround 9 a.m. on October 11, Opelika police responded to a domestic violence call on Opelika Road. However, before authorities arrived at the scene, the suspect left. Police were able to track him to his home, where the hostage incident occurred.\n\nMultiple officers and a SWAT team were outside the suspect\u2019s house on Windway Drive, where police say the suspect barricaded himself inside, armed with a gun, with his three children, one being an infant.\n\nAccording to Auburn officials, they deployed a SWAT team and negotiator to contact the subject.",

After a 3-hour hostage situation involving his wife and children, one of whom is a baby, he is only served with a DV3 charge. The predatory solicitation landed him one night in jail. \n\nSeems pretty messed up. Does he have friends in high places?",

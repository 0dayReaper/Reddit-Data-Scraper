    "postText": "Hey everyone! My name is Ethan and I'm a college freshman who's passionate about music. I know firsthand how valuable music education can be, and I want to help others experience the fulfillment that comes with learning an instrument or mastering a new piece.\n\nI'm building a platform that will help music students easily connect with devoted teachers nationwide. It streamlines the process of finding a teacher, making music lessons more convenient and affordable. It's perfect for busy adults and students with extracurriculars, since lessons will be online.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about the [platform](https://melodysessions.com/), I'd be happy to [keep you updated](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeZVZkRLIjBSIhFexlwK7m_520M7Sl68t0axCPQ6uE4L_YmDw/viewform?usp=sf_link) and let you know when it's available (planned to open this summer).\n\nIf you have any questions, suggestions, or are a dedicated music teacher interested in joining, please let me know. Thanks for reading!",

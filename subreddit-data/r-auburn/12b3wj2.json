It greatly reduces cost and complexity to let gravity do the work of pressurizing the system from elevated tanks and use smaller/fewer pumps to fill the tanks.\n\nTypically, most systems try to turn over the water in the tank every three days or so to maintain residual chlorine levels.\n\nMost of Auburn\u2019s water is supplied by the Lake Ogletree, which stores water from Chewacla Creek. That water is pumped to the filter plant, where it is filtered and chemically treated before being pumped into the system. Some water comes from groundwater wells.",

I photographed the sh*t out of any that I could see during my time there. \nBack home, we do have water tanks like that but they generally don\u2019t have anything written on them.

There are several tanks in the Auburn system, so it\u2019s not the only one. They\u2019ve actually torn down a couple of tanks in the past decade or so. \n\nIt would also be hard to poison the water supply just because it would require so much poison. Auburn uses around 8 million gallons of water a day. And the water is tested in multiple locations every day. If it ever becomes necessary to stop using the water or boil it before using it, the city will issue notices through multiple mediums (radio, tv, social media, etc.) and I\u2019m sure the university will as well.\n\nThe release yearly water quality reports here: https://www.auburnalabama.org/water-resource-management/water-operations/consumer-confidence-reports/\n\nHow far away were the tanks from previous places you lived?",

Rural US systems do tend to have their water towers spread out more because the density of houses is much lower.\n\nAlso, in more hilly or mountainous terrain, there are tanks that just sit in the ground and use the elevation differential of the hill instead of having to have the tower structure. Those are a lot less noticeable, and usually a boring brown color. \n\nOpelika has its own water system. It is linked to Auburn\u2019s system, and Auburn can buy water from Opelika.\n\nAuburn does have 300+ miles of underground water lines as well.",

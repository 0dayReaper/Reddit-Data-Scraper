    "postText": "Hey everyone, I've recently committed to Auburn for graduate school (M.S. in Aquaculture and Fisheries) and I was hoping for some advice on when to jump into finding housing and handling details like that. I start in the Fall 2023 and have found a ton of places available, but I've been told to try to lock something down now, since demand goes up when the new undergraduate class is announced in the late spring/summer?   \n\n\nI have some buddies that did their undergraduate at AU and are sticking around for grad school, and they've told me to avoid samford square and maybe yugo north? Any other spots to totally go for/absolutely avoid? Any other good things to know? Thanks all :)",

Plus you\u2019ll save in gas money.\nThey are going to require you to get $300 or something in dining dollars. Everything on campus costs like $10 to eat, unless you get the side of fried rice at Panda Express (which is meal sized from what they cram in the box).\nIf you are on Facebook at all, look up the Auburn rental groups and secure housing asap.\nGet connected to the GroupMe for your major. \n\nBest of luck! You got this!",

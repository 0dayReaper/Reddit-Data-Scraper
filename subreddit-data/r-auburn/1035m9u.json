    "postText": "So, my fianc\u00e9 and I have been talking of moving to the Auburn/Opelika/Valley area to be closer to work. I've been looking at places to rent and it's either apartment complexes that I know are not good(from personal experience) or they rent by the bedroom and we're not looking to get roommates. Was wondering if other adults had this issue and if you were successful in finding a place. Doesn't have to be an apartment, can be a house/townhouse.",

I definitely went through the same thing though with struggling to find apartments that didn't have reviews of roaches and broken appliances never being fixed, or just the same student housing listing posted 27 times lmao",

There have been some issues with the student housing complex across the street on Shelton Mill lately, but they\u2019ve never spilled into the townhomes.",

            "comment": "The best thing to do is to call all the individual rental companies in the area and inquire if what they have available meets your needs. Each manage separate condos or homes in the area and commonly a unit here or there of a larger complex.\n\nHere is a list of some of the major ones:\n\n- Hayley Management Company (334) 319-4724\n- Plains Properties (334) 209-1120\n- 360 Management (334) 887-3606\n- Northcutt Realty (334) 826-7720\n- Auburn Realty (334) 887-8777\n- First Realty (334) 887-3425\n- Evans Realty (334) 821-7098\n- Badger Properties (334) 821-3023\n- Fucci Realty (334) 821-6581\n- Koul Properties (334) 704-5368\n\nIf you\u2019d like to consider buying, I am a local real estate agent and would be more than happy to sit down with you over a cup of coffee to explain how the buying process works. It\u2019s easier than you may think! Even if it isn\u2019t your goal at the moment, I can give you pointers and guidelines to prepare for future homeownership. \ud83d\ude42",

They were really nice and pretty affordable, close enough to everything. There were a lot of other families and grad students that lived their. We always felt  really safe and most of the units are renovated! I think rent was 1200 a month and we had a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom.",

It ended up being a blessing since we were closer to our house, under construction at the time.\n\nWe finally rented an apartment in Valley and it was a wonderful experience.  Our neighbors were very respectful and reasonably quiet for a high density location.  I don\u2019t see why you'd have any issues - Auburn/Opelika isn\u2019t all about students and the further you look away from Toomer\u2019s Corner, the less issues you\u2019ll find.\n\nGood luck!",

They sometimes have a move in deal, so check that out. \n\nI have personally used Prestige Properties as a home owner that rented my house and they have a great selection of non-student rentals (town homes and houses). \n\nWe rented in our first years from Northcutt Realty. We had a 3/2 house and it was same rent as an apartment or duplex and in a great, family friendly neighborhood-lots of dog walkers and mixture of retirees and young families. Northcutt was good to us, we got our deposit back and they always came to fix anything we needed right away. \n\nThere is a huge selection of apartments near Auburn High School on Samford, they are brand new. Usually new places have move in deals. Worth checking out.",

It's quiet, safe, and you don't have to worry about break ins, stealing, or driving too far to get to anywhere. It's also out of the way enough that you aren't bothered much by traffic or college students. Crunch Fitness is right there and it's now a 60 second drive to The Vintage which is a very classy restaurant and bar.",

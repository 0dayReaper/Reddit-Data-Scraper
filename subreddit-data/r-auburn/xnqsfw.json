    "postText": "So I was hit by someone in a parking lot, of course they didn\u2019t say anything, it\u2019s not major but I\u2019m not paying for it. Is there any kind of message board students use? I\u2019m not that old, just trying to think of the correct term. I wouldn\u2019t think the way snapchat or insta would help. \n\nI have a video of it, the camera wasn\u2019t clear from the top but I\u2019m going to get the camera for the parking lot which registers plates. They can help out or I\u2019ll get the police involved, they\u2019ll get a ticket and I\u2019ll still get my bumper fixed. I\u2019m trying to be nice to them despite them not doing the same.",

I have two schools of thought though, either they've done this before and gotten away with it OR they've never done this before and if they think they'll get away with it they might do it again, if they accidentally hit someone else in a parking lot.  Hold them accountable, really it's for their own good and for you too.",

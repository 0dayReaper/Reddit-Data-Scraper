Odd how this is just making the news.  \n\nCollege Student Who Went Missing 47 Years Ago Identified \n\nHuman bones found inside a submerged car near the Georgia-Alabama state line in 2021 have been matched to a college student who had been missing for 47 years, according to a Chambers County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\n**Kyle Clinkscales, 22, of LaGrange, vanished in January 1976 after leaving the Georgia club where he worked as a bartender to return to school at Auburn University in neighboring Alabama.**\n\nOn the night of January 27, 1976, 22-year-old, Kyle Wade Clinkscales left LaGrange to travel back to Auburn University where he was a student. However, he never arrived and neither he nor his white two-door 1974 Pinto Runabout was ever found.\n\nOn December 7th, 2021, around 11:20 AM deputies with the Chambers County Sheriff\u2019s Office were notified of what appeared to be a car submerged in a creek off of County Road 83 approximately 1 mile from County Road 388.\n\nOnce they arrived on the scene, they recovered the car from the water and it appeared to be an older model Ford passenger car with a 1976 Georgia tag with a Troup County decal.\n\nChambers County contacted the Troup County Sheriff\u2019s Office for assistance in trying to run the tag information. The Troup County tag office was contacted and investigators in our criminal investigations division began to check for any records we may have had.\n\nAfter verifying information, it was found that the tag and VIN matched that of a 1974 Ford Pinto Runabout which was the same car that Kyle Clinkscales was last seen driving on the night of January 27th, 1976.\n\n[https://www.tampafp.com/alabama-college-student-who-went-missing-47-years-ago-identified-from-bones-found-in-georgia/](https://www.tampafp.com/alabama-college-student-who-went-missing-47-years-ago-identified-from-bones-found-in-georgia/)",

It\u2019s off the beaten path but also convenient to many things including the busiest airport in the world. It\u2019s pretty great. Every time I go home I am absolutely reenergized. The pastures, hardwoods and beautiful sunsets with wide open spaces are hard to beat and the community I grew up in was loving and friendly to people. It wasn\u2019t perfect but as a kid I could venture out and my parents knew I would be ok. There is a lot of freedom in that and helps kids grow up to be confident people with an empathetic spirit. I would not change where I grew up. One of the greatest gifts I was ever given.",

I\u2019m sure your parents are very proud of you!  \n\nI grew up SOB, south of Birmingham way out in the country, just north of the Black Belt.  I loved it but left home at 18 to work for Uncle Sam.  Auburn came next and upon graduation, left the state again, not to return permanently for 40 years.\n\nI love it here.  On our little county road, I can usually bicycle for a few miles before I see the first car and when I\u2019m passed, the drivers are very respectful.  The login trucks are very cautious around me.  \n\nThere\u2019s so little traffic that our vizsla will stop playing to watch the vehicle go by!  Side-by-sides are common especially on weekends!  There are regular , large neighborhood gathering on one farm and our beef comes literally from the pasture across from our house.\n\nIn hunting seasons, gunshots are normal and we barely notice them!  While we lock our doors, we probably really don\u2019t need to.  My neighbor, some 300 yards away was thrilled when I called one night when his outside lights were off.  It seems their aunt had been at house doing something and turned them off.  \n\nWe even met the new sheriff\u2026.and voted for him.  It just feels like home.  Finally.",

B) The very top of the car had been sticking out of the creek from the lack of rain, thus causing water levels to be lower. C) Not very many people drive the back roads anymore so less traffic makes it less pair of eyes looking around at their surroundings in these areas.",

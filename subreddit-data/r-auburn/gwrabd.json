The jump between G and C (called an interval in musician's terms) is frequently interpreted by our brains as interchangeable, especially  when played together. It's difficult to distinguish the two notes. An example of them being played together would be \"power chords\" on electric guitars, which would be a CGC. Think the intro of Iron Man.\n\nHopefully someone in the band pipes in. I went to Georgia Tech (I know, why am I here, etc.) and was in the band there, but I do not know Auburn's music very well.",

I tried this on my keyboard and it sounded right. The song being in cut time messes with the timing a bit but I think you have the rests right in your example. Hope this helps!",

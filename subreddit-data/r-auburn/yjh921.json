That means you should be at an entrance gate 40-45 minutes before kickoff if you're sitting in the lower bowl, more than that for upper bowl.\n\nObligatory Toomer's visit for trees and lemonade.\n\nSee if you can find a #24 Jersey to cheer on Coach Caddy.",

There\u2019s a spot of you go 35 mph you can hear the Auburn fight song. \n\nNiffer\u2019s is a good place to eat although it\u2019s not within walking distance. \n\nHave fun! War Eagle!",

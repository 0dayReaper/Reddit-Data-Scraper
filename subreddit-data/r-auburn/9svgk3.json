Thermodynamics actually makes sense, whereas Engineering Physics II throws advanced electromagnetism at you and expects you to somehow learn several classes worth of concepts in 1/4 of a semester.\n\nThe Engineering Physics II curriculum is dumb as hell and includes material  that should be taken as separate classes.\n\nMake it through the Freshman and Sophomore Engineering classes and you will be able to do well in the Junior and Senior level classes easily.\n\nWhat is worse, is that unless you are an electrical engineer, Not only is Engineering Physics II the hardest class you will take, it is also the most useless, and has the most time consuming labs, where you might end up with labs scheduled at 6PM, which sucked.",

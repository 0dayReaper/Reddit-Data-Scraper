We specifically go during cold weather and book a cabin with a balcony and outdoor fireplace. \n\nI've also stayed in a hotel to be right in town. Either way, the area is great for indoor, outdoor, and nighttime activities.",

We also like the Clyde\u2019s table and tavern down the road in Cleveland and the tantrum brewing company nearby. If you like German food the restaurants there really are top notch and most carry a great selection of imports like you used to see before the craft craze (not a complaint about the latter). It\u2019s a great little trip and inexpensive to have a great time and you\u2019ll have so much of the town to yourself",

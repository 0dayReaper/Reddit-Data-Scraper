    "postText": "In the spring of 2001, I was attacked and raped on campus\u2014along with two other women.  The attacks were such a problem, the university had to issue a public statement regarding the matter.  \n\nThey never caught our attacker.  I lived in fear.  TERRIBLE fear.  I had horrible PTSD.\n\nI endured listening to other students claim, \u201cThey\u2019re making it up!!  Nobody got raped!  If it were me, I would have screamed and yelled.\u201d  They didn\u2019t know I was one of the victims.  \n\nIt made me suicidal.  After THREE suicide attempts, I left Auburn to live with my parents and Auburn allowed me to finish my degree at UAH.  So technically, I still graduated from Auburn even though I never had the pleasure to walk at my graduation.\n\nHiring Hugh Freeze is a huge slap in the face to me and the other sex assault victims who were attacked on Auburn\u2019s campus\u2014especially considering he harassed a sex assault victim for speaking up about one of his buddies.  \n\nI am EXTREMELY disappointed in Auburn right now.  I\u2019m sent letters to the President, Athletic Director, and Board Members to voice my disappointment.  I am ASHAMED to be an Auburn Alumni.\n\nTo be ashamed of that\u2026..hurts because I worked so hard for my degree despite my trauma working against me.  I was published in The Auburn Plainsman and in The Auburn Circle.  I worked at Toomer\u2019s Drugs for two years and have that lemonade recipe memorized.  I was a Cliff Hanger.  I went to most baseball games.  I went to most football games.  I AM AUBURN.\n\nSo this hurts.  Big time.  I just thought you deserve to know who you are hurting with some of your comments on here.  \n\nThere are a LOT of us out there who were sexually assaulted on Auburn\u2019s campus.  We\u2019re reading what you are saying and are disgusted with a lot of you.",

Being a Christian is important to me.\n\nI\u2019m all about forgiveness.  That said, I also believe people need to be held accountable.  Unfortunately, many Christians these days fail to understand holding someone accountable doesn\u2019t necessarily mean not forgiving them.\n\nWe deserve better leaders.  And yes, a coach is a leader.  As long as these creeps keep getting rewarded with millions of dollars, the world isn\u2019t going to get any better.\n\nSo yeah, I\u2019m disappointed in Auburn and many of my fellow Christians and many of my friends\u2026..because I see what they \u201clike\u201d and what they post on their social medias.",

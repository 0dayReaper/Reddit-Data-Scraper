    "postText": "Hello all! I'm a Junior Biomedical Engineering Student at SUNY University at Buffalo. I am working with a few engineering classmates on a project and we need additional input/thoughts to revise the design of a proposed medical device for athletes. We want to hear the opinion of students from different colleges. If you participate in any athletic teams or clubs please take the time to fill this out.\n\nYour input is greatly appreciated. Thank you and have a great day!\n\n[https://forms.gle/gq16hUi6rCgWMYQz9](https://forms.gle/gq16hUi6rCgWMYQz9)",

Had a slip fall a year or so ago and I couldn\u2019t work for 3 weeks due to severity of the symptoms. They are definitely a cumulative thing.",

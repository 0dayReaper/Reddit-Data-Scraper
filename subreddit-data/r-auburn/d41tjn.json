    "postText": "I think that was your name. I was very tired. You were helping some girls shill out votes on the concourse. I tried ignoring them, but you came up to me, obviously because you wanted me to vote. I told you about the shitty day I was having, and instead of trying to get me to vote you walked with me and said you hope my day gets better. I really appreciate that my man. I looked for ya when I got outta class to find out who you were supporting to vote, but you were gone. Also sorry if I came off as rude I was just very tired. \n\nBut thank you for being a bro. I hope you had a good day too man &lt;3",

    "postText": "Hello, \n\nCan anyone suggest a psychiatrist for adhd meds? I stopped taking meds once I moved up here 3 years ago, I had been on vivance and a few others throughout the years but my job made it hard for me to get any free time during the day. I have a new job and have more time now so I wanted to try and get back on track. \n\nIs it normal to be drug tested each visit? When I lived in Montgomery the doctor made me submit a test each time, even under vivance. I literally have never done any drugs outside of prescription but my main issue was he billed for the test separately, I assume since insurance wouldn\u2019t cover it but it just got to be a burden, my normal copay for $30 but the test was another $20 and he wanted to see me once a month. Doesn\u2019t seem like a lot but I don\u2019t make a lot.",

Their eyes will perk up if you mention taking a Par-Q questionnaire.\n\nSource: I also have ADHD and was able to focus better on my work once my doctor and I found the right dose. It has helped me succeed in many areas of my life.",

If you're speaking doctor-language then they might be more lenient to help diagnose, but because of the University students abusing meds  most GP's are reluctant to prescribe.\n\nThe good news is that you have a previous diagnosis of ADHD, so just bring your prescriptions with you to the appointment and the GP may prescribe you medication to treat your ADHD. \n\nI would recommend for the long run to continue to search for a psychiatrist, because some GP's would prefer you to get your prescriptions written by a psychiatrist instead of them.",

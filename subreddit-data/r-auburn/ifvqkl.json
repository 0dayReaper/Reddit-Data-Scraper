If there are 5 times the number of infections next week as there were this week, the university will have to look at at least a temporary shut down of in-person classes.

My counter-argument is that they will still be partying but in smaller numbers which means fewer people are exposed at one time. Especially if frat houses are not allowed to host large parties.",

Maybe as college age students you don't have a firm grasp on how the real world operates but without money the university can't really afford to pay 5k employees.  There isn't some magic money pit they can reach in to and keep paying workers with no students and not keep the University financially stable.  For  students this is a 4 year retreat away from their parents so they can party.  Getting sent home means no in person classes and they don't get to party as hard.  For the University sending students home means taking a hard look at who is on the payroll and see what jobs they need cut out for the next 3 months until students come back.  No one wants to start cutting jobs on campus.  The cascading effects of the local economy can be huge.\n\nIf you think there is a room with a bunch of evil top hat and monocle wearing old white guys saying \"we got the money now send them home!\" you are dead wrong.  I've listened to the zoom meetings where the administration has spent hundreds of hours planning and organizing trying to make the fall semester as safe as possible for the students and faculty.  The faculty, staff, and administration want the students on campus all semester and will do everything in their power to make it so. The community needs the students in class all semester.  Like it or not Auburn is a college town and the UNiversity is a big part of the economy.  The student population makes up 1/3 of the number of people in the community.  Take away a good chunk of that 1/3 of the population and now community business which are already hurting will start closing doors.  Unemployment grows worse and the cascading effect will continue.\n\nSo yes it's about the money.  Like it or not the world needs money to operate.",

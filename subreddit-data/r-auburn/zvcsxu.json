I lived there and absolutely loved it. Studio apartments that are a couple of hundred square feet - (I seem to remember 275ish square feet). Never used my car to get to campus - either rode a bicycle or walked.",

I don\u2019t even think the Village gives as great of an experience as true dorm living like the Quad. You just end up being able to meet so many more people. I lived in the Quad and highly highly recommend it. Having laundry and a kitchen off campus is nice, sure, but this is really your only shot to be able to have the dorm experience! You have the rest of college to live off campus \u25e1\u0308",

Most of the close friend groups of my peers  appeared to have been set in Freshman or Sophomore year, a lot of bonding from being in close proximity to new people and everyone essentially in the same boat as you. I became really close to several of my neighbors - but only like 5 or 6 folks and that\u2019s because I made a big effort to meet them. Most folks in apartments are too busy and have their own stuff going on to really worry about making friends with neighbors.",

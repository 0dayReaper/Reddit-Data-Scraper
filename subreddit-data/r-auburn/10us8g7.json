    "postText": "Update:  Thanks for all the support and advice.  Took my PC to Auburn Technology Solutions on Ross and yes, I would recommend them.\n\nNeed some quick advice.  I went to IT Helpdesk at the library and they said hardware issues are what is wrong with my new PC laptop today.  I don't have a car, is there anywhere closer than BestBuy that I can get a good diagnosis and repair?",

For hardware in store they're limited to hdd and ram which is a fucking joke. Any real fix they will send off to their repair center and itll be gone forever and likely return still damaged. \n\nJust don't bother with them. You can do every repair that they can in store with Google and a screwdriver. \n\nSource - worked for GS a year or so.",

Every time I went, I would always pay for the services before I left. It was expensive, but I was na\u00efve and just paid for it anyway. Over two years go by and I get a hit on my credit report that they are sending me to collections for unpaid bills. I luckily had kept all my receipts, and was able to prove I had zero balance. After some back and forth, they finally admitted it was their error and removed the collections claim. But if I had not kept the receipts I would have been screwed. \n\nI had some fillings done, and one crown replacement. All the fillings ended up cracking anyway and needed to be redone by a different place",

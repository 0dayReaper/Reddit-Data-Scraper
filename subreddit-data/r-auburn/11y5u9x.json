If you are living in the dorms, AU will assign you a roommate.\n\nLastly if you don't have success in the first couple of weeks, Auburn has an organization week on the concourse where most of the student organizations have booths explaining what they do and are recruiting. I highly advise everyone to join an organization.",

Plant Based Plainsmen is also a super chill group for mostly vegans but they let anyone join and participate. They mostly just go out to eat and have vegan potlucks but they\u2019re super diverse and fun",

However, I would rather pay $15-20k instead of $60-70k while still receiving the same quality of education. Also I'm not a fan of how packed Auburn is, so I'm looking to transfer to a smaller college.",

    "postText": "I am thinking about applying to Auburn. I am interested in becoming a professional airline pilot. I was thinking about getting a degree in Professional flight but, I want a backup in case things don\u2019t go as planned (Aviation Management). Would it make sense to major in Aviation Management with a minor in Professional flight? \n\nThose of you that have experience in the aviation portion of Auburn, I\u2019d love to hear your opinions about the quality of the education etc. I just toured Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. How do you think they compare?\n\nThanks.",

            "comment": "Major in something that you can fall back on if flying doesn\u2019t work out for you and fly on the side. It will take you more than 4 years at auburn or embry riddle to go from 0 time to 1000 hours and get all those ratings. If you fly on the side with part 61 and you are persistent you can get everything done much faster and spend that leftover time building your 1500 hours as a CFI or whatever you want to do. The flight costs are astronomical ($230ish/hour for the 172s and ~$500/hour for the seminoles) and are not included in the cost of tuition. If money isn\u2019t an issue for you then disregard that statement. The constant terrible weather especially during the spring and summer does not help with progression either. We follow a training course outline to the T. If the weather is bad, you will just have to do it during your next flight block. You practice what auburn wants you to practice and there are no real opportunities to practice things that you personally feel you need to work on. The program is also experiencing growing pains as we have once again admitted more students than the program can handle. Over 700 pro flight students with only 50ish planes. Also a pro flight degree is worthless if you lose your medical or something else happens. Major in engineering or something and go to your local flight school and get your stuff done. \n\n-sincerely someone who started out in pro flight and lost their passion for flying due to auburns ridiculous costs and overbearing procedures. Switched my major and started flying on the side. Having a lot more fun now\u2026",

            "comment": "So as I\u2019m nearing the end of the program I can give some good advice here. If you have a lot of money and don\u2019t care about time then this is the place. The planes are top notch and getting from 0 to commercial pilot takes a bit over 4 years. Make sure you understand what that means though. You finish here around 300 hours. Airlines don\u2019t hire before 1000. You have to get your instructor ratings to gain hours the fastest and work as that or go into another field to gain hours as a pilot. If you want cheap and fast look at Montgomery box aviation or Birmingham flight center for the two closest ones. Auburn is the nicest but the slowest and their might be a waitlist to even start the program at the moment. I loved it here but it was the slowest and most tiring program and if you want cheaper and faster than anything else works. There are nice perks and I got a minor in business to even myself out. It\u2019s a hard program and most people drop out at some point. I\u2019d say 65 or 70 percent never make it to instrument rating and switch to a diff degree. Overall it was a choice I wouldn\u2019t change as I\u2019ve gotten good opportunities and loved the planes and some instructors. If you are fully sold just make sure you understand prices. My private cost around 30 I think and instrument was like 20 ish. Add a good 5 or so thousand more as the numbers are bare minimum and you won\u2019t complete in that time. Also if you commit definitely fly summers or expect 5 or 6 years here.",

Plus I think they boot or tow after the 3rd ticket for a not on file car vs the 6th or so if registered.\n\nEdit: \"with 5 violations on a registered vehicle or 2 violations of a non-registered vehicle during a single academic year the vehicle may be towed, immobilized, or wheel locked\"",

I\u2019ve parked at the rec 3 days a week for most of the semester and nothings happened to me. Same with my roommate and he parks there pretty much everyday admittedly sometimes just for an hour or so. Could just be some insane luck tho",

Hopefully you're not like one of my old buddies that found out he had about $600 in unpaid tickets when he went to graduate and it was blocked. \n\nEdit: Checked online and looks like you're right about them getting rid of the 2:30 rule. Would make more sense why the trucks aren't around at 2 anymore. Really sucks because it actually made the C zone pass even remotely useful for anyone that spent most of their time on the north end of campus",

I agree with the other posters that are recommending you retake it, especially if you aren\u2019t confident in your abilities.  If your foundation is poor, you\u2019re not going to be as successful at higher level concepts.\n\nI retook calculus as a freshman even though I could have skipped it with my AP credits, and it did help later on in the other math courses you will be required to take. Plus like others have said, it can be a way to give you an early GPA boost.   \n\nWho you get as a teacher will also be an influence on your success. I recall having a tough time in DiffEq because of not being able to understand the teacher.",

I should have never retaken it, the prof made Cal 1 seem like a foreign language and I ended up with a D my first semester. Destroyed my GPA. If you have credit for the class, keep moving along imo.\n\nAdded: As a freshman you don't have much option as to what professor you get so keep that in mind. I got unlucky and had a bad professor who spoke little english. If I could redo it all, I would have just suffered through my next math class and refreshed on Cal 1 topics that I wasn't sure of.",

That being said, I found all the calculus series to be quite manageable.. unfortunately I had Erkan Nane for Calc 2, and even as a Calc 2 tutor, I had a 70 (no curve) and the class average was a 17. The semester before me he curved 40 points at the end. Not my semester. No curve. The man failed almost 200 students.. I was registered with him for stats later on and immediately swapped with anyone else. Employing him is a crime.\n\nWayfairKids - IYKYK",

So, even if you don\u2019t wind up retaking it, a little hard work and you should be okay.\n\nEither way, good luck!",

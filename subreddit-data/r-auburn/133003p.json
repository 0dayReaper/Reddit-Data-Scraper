But I\u2019m talking maybe one a year. Mostly rappers or jam or electronic like hippie sabotage\n\nNot much of a scene now to my knowledge. I get my fix in Birmingham and on tour during festival season. If Birmingham isn\u2019t too far for you, there is a huge scene. I have several homies up there that play every week. Bosses lounge does great events and so do a few other venues. Heady Made Weird, SaMacca Sound (funktion/Murda 1 sound system), Lykwid (upside down collective) are always doing shows w themselves and then artists like Slab, page up, etc. \n\nMy brother hunter (Raaket) is gonna be up there in a week right before Solfest throwing a little home town reunion show. \n\nIf you\u2019d like I can send you a bunch of resources for Birmingham and Atlanta. 140s or bust babY",

Doesnt matter if its at renegades at a massive fest or if its an underground venue in a smaller city.. Favorite set was probably 40oz Wonderland's. That day we had them, Charles (rip), &amp; Ternion Sound. Among others. If you arent hip on Labgroup or Ternion Sounds, definitely check them out. Lab group is the circle CharlestheFirst put on. Ternion Sound is just 3 dudes making crazy sounds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I'm off, I'll try to remember to pull up my SoundCloud and Instagram to give you more names.",

DDD this month, $20 plus travel, compared to like $400 for that sol fest \"festival\"....\n\nSo I spent a lot of time reading like self-help book and listening to podcasts and all that for a while.... I hate to say this, but riches are in niches... even though this is not about the money, rather the music... If you notice an empty space (or a problem), go ahead and create it (find the solution).\n\nIf we all have to drive hours to go see shows, there is a problem. So, one can create a solution for said problem:\n\nA Sound System to travel across Alabama or the lower east tri-state region. \ud83d\ude0e",

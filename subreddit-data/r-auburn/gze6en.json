I don't consider those to be evil.\n\nIf people were out in the middle of a hurricane protesting racism then the racism must be pretty bad. Covid has also disproportionately affected the lives of black people. Protestors are aware of this and the fact that people are still protesting really underscores how bad racism is.",

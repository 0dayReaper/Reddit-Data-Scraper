Hugh Freeze never questioned the legitimacy of her assault. He just defended McCaw.

If you genuinely believe that he has, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not going to to try to change your mind. You can either do your research or keep on keepin\u2019 on. Doesn\u2019t make a difference to me or HF\u2019s employment status one way or the other, since the program has made it clear that they don\u2019t care what the fans think of the hire.",

If you did your research you\u2019d see that a lot of the scandals against him are unfounded or happened when he wasn\u2019t even employed. The calls to brothels or whatever you wanna call it were personal not for players, I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s any better but too run his name through mud without knowing the facts is ridiculous.",

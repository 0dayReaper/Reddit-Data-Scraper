            "comment": "In my honest experience, the CS program here is very middling. There are a lot of courses that are taught by people that are extremely insightful and will make you want to attend lecture (ie: Hendrix), and then there are professors that will just leave you wondering how they\u2019ve been appointed to teach that course (albeit, this is more towards the later end of the curriculum). I have some friends that went to UMich and although it\u2019s not comparable, I was quite surprised to see the sheer contrast between the material taught there vs over here. \n\nWith that being said, if you want to be proficient in the field you\u2019ll definitely have to do extra outside of class but I think that\u2019s generally the case for most other universities. Auburn\u2019s computer science program is definitely not the worst, but it also is sort of shocking how many people graduate  from here without really knowing anything (in the context of Comp Sci)",

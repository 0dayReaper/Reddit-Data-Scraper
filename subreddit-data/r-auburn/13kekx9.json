    "postText": "Hi folks. New to Reddit and new to Auburn! I am a student about to start at a new anesthesia assistant program at VCOM/Bluefield on the Auburn campus. I came down with my fianc\u00e9 and she is a work from home engineer. We\u2019d love to meet other like-minded individuals/couples going to Auburn University that could show us what\u2019s interesting around here!\n\nWe also have an mini Aussie and love to be outdoors (we\u2019re from Colorado). We love puzzle nights and the such. Anyone know of any means of connecting to others with similar likes and interest?",

            "comment": "You and your Aussie will LOVE Kiesel dog park. It's on or off leash, has a big and small dog yard if you need it, and miles of gravel trail. People are incredibly friendly there and every Thursday or so they have some event going on.\n\nI don't know much about different gaming places. Sometimes Niffers or La Plaza will do some bingo or games on Friday or Saturday night. Personally, I like to hang out at 3:23 for a cigar and a whiskey every now and then. It's a very chill atmosphere.\n\nOpelika, the historic district, is where it's at though. Zazu's is a MUST. Get their poutine!\n\nFor the Auburn area, The Depot, The Acre, and further north The Vintage are great (higher end) places for a date night.\n\nMizu Ramen is delicious, La Mariana and Agave Loco are phenomenal Mexican places, and the best place - hands down, for coffee (or wine) is Well Red. It's a quaint little coffee and book shop that serves homemade food and good times. My wife and I get there at opening (7 or 8am) every Friday and Saturday. It's our favorite little hide out in Auburn.",

There are mountain bike rides every Tuesday night at 6 if riding is your thing. \n\nCMDA is a ministry affiliated with VCOM, and even if it hasn\u2019t been your thing in the past, it is a great way to get to know folks in the area and get a support network. VCOM is hard!\n\nWithin an easy driving range is the Smith Mtn Firetower trail system up in Dadeville by Lake Martin.",

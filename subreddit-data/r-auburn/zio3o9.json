            "comment": "Historically, Auburn is an A &amp; M school, and they still have strong A &amp; M programs. When I was there (early to mid 90s), they had strong engineering (mechanical, textile, and aerospace IIRC), forestry, aviation, and veterinary programs. I believe the nursing and/or pharmacy programs were pretty strong, too. I also learned they apparently had one of the few accredited industrial design schools at the time. \n\nI started out there in Architecture, and wound up getting a Social Studies Education degree. We had some amazing professors. Probably the most well known was Wayne Flynt. He specialized in Far East history (his passion) and Deep South history (what he grew up in). He was up for a Pulitzer for his book \u201cPoor but Proud\u201d about poverty in the Deep South. He was a great prof. One of many I had there.",

I think, at its core it\u2019s still an A&amp;M school, though. \n\nI\u2019ll also add that I generally recommend most people get an associates degree at a CC rather than do their first 2 years at a 4-year. The cost of the 4-year just isn\u2019t worth it in most, though certainly not all, cases. Had I started in Education, that would have been the right path for me. Unfortunately, the Architecture curriculum started in earnest the summer after Freshman year when I was there!\n\nBest of luck, and War Eagle!",

The mechanical and aerospace engineering programs are very highly regarded, the vet school is excellent, and the forestry program is one of the larger and more active in research in the region. \n\nAdditionally, the ag school is very very good, and has a lot of very strong programs. The computer science department was very good for a good while, although anecdotally I\u2019ve heard from a few people who might know things that it\u2019s gone downhill the last several years (but this also could just be a case of alums being grouchy because things aren\u2019t how they were 25 years ago). The building science department is supposed to be pretty decent as well. \n\nBiased, but because it\u2019s the department I worked in for most of a decade, but the physics department has grown a LOT, both in number of faculty and by more than doubling the research dollars at play, and it looks to be continuing that direction. They massively upgraded their facilities in the last few years too, the building now is very new and fancy, not at all the ancient rundown cinder block heap they were in when I first got there.",

    "postText": "Was thinking about taking a geology minor and thus need to take GEOL 1100; should I take it online or in-person? Any downsides to online that would make in-person more straightforward? \n\n(I find geology interesting so if the online course is mind-bogglingly boring like some of the other online courses, I'd prefer to avoid it.)",

It's a good intro class to geology and it's the class that made me switch majors from engineering. You should also see rock samples passed around in class too, helps reinforce the material.",

When I was at Auburn, Geology classes moved from Petrie (near Haley) to the old colleseum, so it made getting to classes on time more difficult. I don't know where they are conducted now, but something to think about too.",

However, the quizzes were easy and the labs were pretty interesting. You get to take home a \u201crock kit\u201d for the semester to do your labs. I took this class just for fun, and it was actually one of my favorite classes that I\u2019ve taken!",

There were a lot of quizzes, and I think maybe 4 tests but everything was open book/note so it wasn\u2019t too bad. For the weekly discussions, you could come up with whatever topic you wanted to talk about as long as it was related to the course. There were two projects where you had to make a presentation and voice recording, but nothing was graded too harshly and lots of extra credit available. Definitely recommend taking this course either in person or online",

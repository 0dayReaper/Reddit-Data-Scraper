    "postText": "So my buddy and I are planning on making the trip down for the Penn State game week and were looking to get a tailgate setup. Our plan was to try and get a spot in the Hayfields grass lot, aiming to get to the lot around 12pm on Friday. Its only one car -- do you think that will be an issue?\n\nI know there are a few other free lots that also open around 2-- are any of those grass lots that we have a better shot of getting into than the Hayfields?\n\nFor paid lots, are there any to look out for that are better than others? We will have a charcoal grill, canopy, etc. so looking for a grass lot.",

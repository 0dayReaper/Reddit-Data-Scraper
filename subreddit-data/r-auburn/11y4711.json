Just don\u2019t forget your Eng. friends when you get that boss job!\n\nOh, and for Thermodynamics it was 3 questions worth 30%, 30% and 40% respectively. I had well over an hour. I didn\u2019t finish the last question, so I got a 55 on that test! Like you said, we have to complain about our classes!",

            "comment": "This is cute. I used to crack jokes about how business majors just took half the day to play frisbee. Then, I had a heart-to-heart with a business major friend who was genuinely concerned about his ability to make it in the world after college. He literally told me that he'd spent a number of hours that week throwing a frisbee and wasn't sure how he'd handle the stress of a job and responsibilities after college. \ud83d\ude02 I'll admit that it was a little difficult to take him seriously, but he's doing quite well for himself years later.\n\nOne major isn't objectively better than another. The bit about doing what you love and is a good fit for you is so true!\n\nIt's worth noting that engineering management often requires one to have been an engineer first.",

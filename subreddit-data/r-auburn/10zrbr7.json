Through affirmative action programs African American and Latino populations have it much easier getting into colleges and getting jobs. Due to their only being a certain amount of jobs in a market this comes at the cost of Asian and whites. This is currently in the Supreme Court being reviewed right now actually Becuase of how bad it is. If your in the top decile academically as an Asian American applying to Harvard you have a ~12% chance of admission but if blacks then raise that to well over 50. Even if your in the 4th or 5th academic decile as an African American you still have a higher chance at admission then a top decile Asian or white applicant. Affirmative action programs and college admissions is systemic racism, it\u2019s embedded in our institutions.",

Previously, applicants with similar or greater merit to others were being rejected from highly selective colleges because of a preference for mostly white applicants, both through explicit discrimination in through the use of metrics that correlate with race, affirmative action is an attempt to partially correct this problem. It\u2019s not like black students were previously going to college at the same rate as white students, and then affirmative action happened and now Blackson is go to college at higher race than white students. Colleges should choose who they accept based on how well that student will be able to perform at that school. Well, should they do this, or should they choose who they accept based on the merit of the student? (these approaches are different win, for example, systemic racism at the university, and within society with disadvantaged students of one racial group compared to equally meritorious students of another racial group.)",

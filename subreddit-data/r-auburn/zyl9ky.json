    "postText": "Anybody around who would like to play baseball in the near future? Even if it's just going to the field (typically Duck Samford Park) to hit or throw. I am not aware of any organized baseball leagues in the Auburn/Opelika area, but if there are any, I would love to join. I just wanna play some baseball, man.\n\nThere was a post made a year or two ago that was similar to this one - trying to get folks together to play baseball. We had a small group for a while and we even played in a league in Columbus. Was a good time, but people come and go, have school and/or life they have to deal with, etc...\n\nSo, this post is acting similar to that older post from a few years ago. Trying to get people of \\*any skill level\\* together to play some ball (you don't have to have played in HS or college; all are welcome). I have already graduated, so my only time constraint is work which can be managed. \n\nIf interested, DM me on here. Thx",

On the big scale, when we would start gathering will simply depend on how many people are interested and how long it takes to get enough people. Would most likely be on weekends. Specific times tbd.",

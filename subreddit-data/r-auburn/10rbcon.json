    "postText": "I\u2019m looking for a good recommendation of somewhere to refinance. I know they need to make their money and there will be interest. I\u2019m just hoping to find somewhere that seems like they actually care rather than just trying to squeeze every bit out of me they can get. My credit score isn\u2019t terrible but I also wouldn\u2019t classify it as great, so I know that limits me a little. Any recommendations or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

Since my refi I have moved all of my $ into their banking (3.75% APY savings / 2.5% APY checking) and I also use their credit card (3% cash back). \n\nFollow this link and we can both make $300.

That being said, most of Auburn is about as safe as you can be in Alabama, with petty opportunistic crimes of theft being the most likely thing you will encounter, if you ever experience crime firsthand. Keep your car doors locked, don't leave your nice bike sitting on your lawn unchained, and you're unlikely to ever have anything swiped.\n\nThe only areas of Auburn that I would consider particularly \"bad\" (relative of course, especially compared to Montgomery/Birmingham), is the area south of Drake Middle School and north of the tracks, and anything on Longleaf.",

It was an excellent area, and we really enjoyed living their. It\u2019s zoned for Cary Woods, which is a great elementary school, and you\u2019re close to a lot of things downtown. We never felt unsafe, we had lots of of nice neighbors. The area is a bit transient\u2014a lot of young families or early career professionals\u2014but that\u2019s about it.",

There is a mix of older homes and town homes, some kept up better than others, some are rentals, but that describes most of Auburn to me. I have lived in 3 different parts of town now and this is my favorite area by far. Pick Elementary/Cary Woods school district is by far one of the best elementary school combos. Houses go fast here, makes for easy resale or rental if you have to move.",

We've accidentally left our garage door open all night a couple times, we accidentally left our front door unlocked a few times, and it was never a problem. I think some chipmunks took advantage of the garage thing by nibbling a hole in some bird seed... But that was the only intrusion. \n\nNeighbors all look out for each other, there. Everyone works and takes care of their property, and is usually willing to lend a helping hand. Family friendly, pet friendly, and just a great place to live. I hope that will be your experience if you purchase a home there!",

It\u2019s pretty ridiculous that they are allowed to disturb an entire neighborhood each day on such a large scale, but Auburn doesn\u2019t have a noise ordinance.  I keep waiting for one of my older neighbors to get fed up with them and do something about it but thus far they\u2019ve been allowed to keep being trashy and loud.",

There are some students living here but it\u2019s not a rowdy student housing type of area. I go for walks daily, never felt unsafe or had any weird interactions. Never had anything stolen. All my neighbors I\u2019ve met have been really nice.\n\nSo yeah, definitely not a bad neighborhood. Most of auburn is pretty safe. Biggest consideration is really where students are living and if you want to be in the middle of that. The only kind of sketchy areas are near the public housing and even those aren\u2019t that bad compared to other cities.",

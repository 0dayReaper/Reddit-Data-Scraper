            "comment": "Generally for CS, you don\u2019t need a masters unless you\u2019re going for some specialization like data science, cyber, ai, etc. If the masters program is anything like the undergrad, there is little reason to choose auburn for academics. \n\nAuburn never provided me any job opportunities through career fairs or any connections. I was able to gather all of those on my own. Coursework is fine and fairly standard, but there\u2019s a lot of crappy professor like every college.\n\nWith all that, I enjoyed going to auburn and especially the life outside of school. Because there isn\u2019t as much emphasis on academics as a t20 CS school, you have much more free time to find internships and learn things on your own. So like almost every college in CS, the school you go to doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s the effort you put in",

Auburn has some good professors, but I must warn you that a lot of the professors are just coasting. Don\u2019t know exactly why but I guess they are just tired of chasing academic excellence or something. They got tenured and done.",

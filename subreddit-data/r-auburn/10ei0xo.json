    "postText": "Hi all, sorry for this post but there has been a personal emergency and I wont returning to Auburn. Therefore I need to sublease my apartment. It is at the Uncommon Auburn, one of the nicest apartment complexes I have lived in my time as a student at Auburn. It is a 3by3 floor plan and the building amenities includes 24/7 fitness center, yoga studio, on demand fitness, golf lounge/simulator, resort-style pool, pool lounge, hot tub, game day lounge, study courtyards, grilling area, tanning bed, computer labs with free printing and scanning, private study rooms, coffee and breakfast bar and pet parks. The room comes with its own washer dryer, and it is facing the university so it has a great view. It is around a 5 minute walk to campus and around a 7-10 minute walk downtown. If you or anyone u know is still looking for a space please let me know.",

            "comment": "Coach Freeze and Co. have me feeling more excited about Auburn Football than any other season in recent history. We\u2019re built strong on the inside with a very solid coaching staff and our recruiting class keeps getting better and better. With everything we have going on I think I\u2019m most excited about a new FG kicker and I\u2019m super pumped about Walker White. Lots to be excited about for us this fall and the future seasons too! War Eagle!!\n\nEdit: I got downvoted by Bryan Harsin and Anders Carlson\u2019s burner accounts",

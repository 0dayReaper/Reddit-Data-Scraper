I'm willing to bet that mostof the credits from from the Catholic college would have transferred to Auburn anyway. They probably just went with the withdrawals from Ole Miss and never saw anything about the other school on paper. So you partied it Ole Miss and couldn't show up for class so you withdrew how in the crap do you fuck out of a tiny Catholic private college? This is why I still think everybody should serve four or more years in the military before you go to school. College is wasted on 18 and 19-year-olds most of the time",

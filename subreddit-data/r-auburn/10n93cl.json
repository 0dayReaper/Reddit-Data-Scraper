Took me till about early Jan to get a spot and I applied on it in August. If you are willing, Uber or Lift would be easier to get on than a delivery service rn until probably summer when students leave. But at that point there won\u2019t be a whole lot of orders",

            "comment": "DoorDash. \n\nUber eats is too hard/complicated to get a spot and Grubhub is too popular so getting a spot is hard. \n\nIt all depends on how much you are willing to drive and how busy the night is. If you are getting order after order with no breaks you can make like 20$+ an hour. Depending on tips, each order might pay around 5$. If you drive on the weekends for a few hours each day you can do pretty well. You just have to factor the cost of gas in because sometimes DoorDash will send you a little further than you might think. If you plan to drive during the week it might be less busy but there is a feature where you can schedule your week and get a reserved slot- DoorDash uses a system where once it has enough drivers in the area, it stops other drivers from being able to deliver. \n\nGood luck and feel free to dm with any other questions",

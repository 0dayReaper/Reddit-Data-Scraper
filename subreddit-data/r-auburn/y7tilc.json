    "postText": "Hey everyone, \n\nThis semester I had planned to stay home and enroll fully online. However, once the semester started I had to change course and ended up coming back to campus. I didn't have housing so I signed with The Collective (formerly Aspen Heights) going by the pictures on their website. When I got there my unit was a massive disappointment. The furniture, in particular, is beyond the pale and quite simply it's pretty obvious they misrepresented the product/service they agreed to provide. There is no question about it. \n\nI wanted to ask if someone has been through something similar and if that's the case, if they have taken legal action. And if so, if there is a specific firm or attorney in the area you might recommend. \n\nThank you in advance for any suggestions or advice.",

It preferably needs to be evidence that you can prove is not your fault. I hope you took photos of everything when you first moved in. \n\nHighlight the spots in the lease you believe they\u2019ve broken and memorize or at least become intimately familiar with what it says.\n\nYou\u2019ll probably want to talk to an attorney who deals with this stuff regularly.",

We ended up transferring units and now it\u2019s fine. The rent is cheap so that\u2019s the main reason I havent left. They really try to sell you their show apartment so just realize that\u2019s probably not the cleanliness you are getting.",

So at that point you can find a place that has a 6 month lease in advance so that buy August you would be able to switch easily  to them, or you could renew another lease at the same place and do what I'm doing, get someone to take over your lease for when you leave.",

    "postText": "My wife and I go to Vegas decently often and are used to their casinos\n\nI know Alabama can't hope to match them for quality, but we've been to wind creek and had a blast too \n\nI have questions for anyone who's been to victory land. Couldn't find this on their website since it's so bad\n\n1. Do they have actually dog racing on site? Or is it all just televised?\n2. Is the casino at least decent? Vicksburg casinos for example were embarrassing and I'd never go back. But if it's between them and wind creek in quality it could be fun.\n3. Is it only slots there? Any table games?\n\nThanks!",

Last time I was there the track looked over grown and like shit. Other then that, that is it. \n\nI\u2019d go to buloxi if you are looking for something closer to Vegas.",

As far as I know, they're up and running with electronic bingo machines now.\n\nDog racing is no longer happening on-site, but you can still catch simulcast greyhound and horse racing. As for the casino itself, they've got a range of electronic bingo machines, slots, and electronic versions of popular table games like blackjack and roulette.\n\nIf you've been to Vegas be ready to be a little disappointed... but I mean, we're in Alabama so \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

I had an absolute blast at wind creek, so if it's anything like that I think I'd enjoy\n\nVery disappointed in no live racing though... That was the only unique thing I was really interested in. Never bet on live racing before\n\nThanks for the reply! Any idea if they have that electronic Kentucky derby game with the mechanical horses??",

Plus with the renovations they have been doing for the last couple of years. There's a lot more going on in Biloxi than ever before. And if you do go down there make sure you hop on over to Ocean Springs. They're downtown is amazing. Especially when it's a festival weekend or they're doing open venues. Little bit of something for everybody. And if you go any day besides a Sunday or Monday get up early and go to Tat-O-Nut in Ocean springs. Need to get there before 10:00 a.m. to So they won't be sold out. Best donuts you will ever have. If you want casual dining, seafood in Biloxi Make sure you check out the blind tiger. And for the best steaks in Biloxi go to Mary Mahoney's. It is right across from the Beau Rivage and the hard Rock in Biloxi. It's simply amazing food",

They got swapped over to some other game, but it still looks like a slot machine but doesn\u2019t have the little bingo card in the corner (this might have changed, idk. It was a few months back when they mentioned the swapping out the machines) \n\nBut I definitely recommend Biloxi if you\u2019ve never been. My favorite is the Palace Casino. They have table games and real slot machines. It\u2019s non smoking and also has a buffet restaurant that is not bad, IMO",

    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nMy son has applied to Auburn and plans to study engineering next year.  We are making plans to buy him a computer for his dorm room, and realize that engineering students need a high-end machine that can run all the CAD software.  However, we also know that there are many computer labs around the engineering department and wonder if most students just use the labs for that kind of work.  If so, we would get him something more mobile, like a surface pro.",

            "comment": "Hello! Mom of an Auburn engineering freshman here. If you go to the Auburn engineering website, there is a chart with computer specs that will help guide you. It lists minimum requirements for a computer, as well as specs if you want a little more. They suggest you to avoid Apple products, as they won't support most software used in the college of engineering. We got him an HP business laptop. He has yet to use the computer lab, but I am sure he will as he progresses!",

By \"decent laptop\", do you mean something that is capable of handling the engineering software or just something that he can use to do the rest of his classwork?  Specifically, I am looking at either a Surface Pro 8 which would be great for general classwork, mobility and battery life if he doesn't need a beefy machine for the engineering software.  But if he needs something for the engineering software, he will have to get something that compromises on mobility (plus more money).",

As an Electrical, I might have had one program downloaded on my laptop. Civil, Mechanical, Chemical might need more. Not sure.

Also, sounds like he\u2019s going to be living on campus so very easy access to the labs. Very rare when I went to a lab that somebody from my class wasn\u2019t in there.",

A lot of people use a smaller laptop and then use the labs for the programs that require a little power. \nPersonally, I made it by with a ~$700 low end gaming laptop, and it could handle everything I needed to do, and then some. I credit having my current job (graduated) to buying that laptop after working my freshman summer, because it meant I could do SolidWorks at home (when group members did not have access), so it put me ahead.",

While I had a Mac laptop, I couldn\u2019t use it due to solidworks not being able to run on it(yeah you can technically run it with an emulator but it\u2019s extremely slow if so). I did however have a windows desktop in my apartment that I used for video games which could easily run the software for school. \n\nThat however became a pain since I couldn\u2019t access files unless I was in the lab or on my desktop. \n\nSo in light of that, id recommend a gaming laptop. Let\u2019s him run the software anytime anywhere. Yeah the labs are 24/7 access but can become a pain to access if you live off campus.",

Enjoy your summer even if you are behind. No one is going to think any less of you if it takes you longer than 4 years to graduate.",

I was placing in state level math competitions in high school,  35/36 on the math portion of the ACT, aced the math portion of the PSAT and it was still hard. Looking at the curriculum it's gotten even harder, since.\n\nI'm not saying it can't be done... But he's in for a major uphill battle.",

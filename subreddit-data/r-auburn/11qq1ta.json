Great part about Auburn is that they make it easy to double major or take other challenging classes from other disciplines. I was able to double major and minor because of three things:\n\n1. Ease of scheduling due to honors college priority registration.\n2. Auburn\u2019s GENEROUS AP credit policy (I came in with like 60 credit hours)\n3. Auburn let\u2019s you take more than 18 hours for free if you sign up for it. \n\nAuburn is really a school that you get out of it what you put into it. Tons of opportunities for research and extracurriculars are available with the same SEC college experience you would expect.\n\nSounds like you have great options though!",

I love north Florida, but Tallahassee as a city is not for me. There is no place like Auburn. The city of Auburn has grown a ton since I graduated, but it\u2019s still very much a college town.  I\u2019d encourage you to visit each campus. I truly loved my time at Auburn and had mostly wonderful professors. I don\u2019t know if they still have the learning community program (or if it\u2019s still the same program), but that was a great way to meet students on the same track. I am still friends with a couple of people from my learning community several years later. Good luck and War Eagle!",

            "comment": "Here are some things I can tell you I love about having chose this school. (I am a senior majoring in business analytics. Which is like halfway between business and computer science) 1. The respect this school has. What do I mean by that? I mean that it is a respected school and is noticed at one of the most accredited universities in the SEC behind Vanderbilt. It is also, in my opinion, an everything school. Since 2019 when I got here we have beat Alabama once in the iron bowl and went into double overtime another year. We have, according to joe burrow, the loudest stadium in all of college. We have been to the final four in 2019 in basketball. We\u2019re ranked #1 in the nation in basketball as well. We are very good in baseball and we\u2019re runner up in the World Series one year while I was here and are  currently are ranked in the top 20. Have a gold medalist gymnast. The list goes on and this is what people mean when they say Auburn feels like \u201cfamily\u201d. It\u2019s hard to find schools that are respectable in school and in sports. When sports are competitive it makes attending them much more fun and full of \u201cschool spirit \u201c per-say. Another lovely thing is the bars. The reason I bring up the bars because we have \u201cSkybar\u201d this bar has been voted top three in the nation for best bar. I did not realize how superior it was until I started traveling to other college campuses like Mississippi State or Alabama. If u want to dance in a \u201cmosh pit\u201d.. you can. Sit in booths and have conversations with your friends.. you can. Or you can sit outside on a nice night. I also personally like other bars like \u201c1716\u201d  where it is more calm and you can play trivia on weeknights. Throughout my 4 years I have talked with many of my past high school friends or just college transfer students in general. I have met plenty of people who hate the college they go too or hated the one the transferred from, but I have never met anyone who doesn\u2019t genuinely love it here. I\u2019m happy to answer any more specific questions if you\u2019d like.",

(again i love it so much it\u2019s hard to leave!)",

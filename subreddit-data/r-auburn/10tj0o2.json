They do monthly trivia nights at Avondale Bar and more family-friendly events like outdoor picnics and coffee shop drag shows on occasion.\n\nThere used to be a dedicated gay bar a couple years back called Derailed, but it got shut down for tax problems I think. I'm not sure if anything has completely filled the niche it left behind.",

Not really like a club though to my knowledge it\u2019s just supposed to be a chill kinda fancier spot. I can\u2019t remember the name just that it sounded hipstery\n\nBut to be honest the closest gay bar I can confirm exists is called splash and it\u2019s in Panama City but I\u2019m sure there a decent gay scene in Atlanta",

            "comment": "For bars or a bigger scene, either Birmingham or Atlanta is your best bet. locally though here\u2019s a quick rundown of stuff I\u2019m aware of: Pride on the Plains is our local LGBTQIA+ organization that primarily focuses on running monthly events and a yearly Pridefest in June. http://www.prideontheplains.com https://www.facebook.com/prideontheplains\n\nThe Mizfits is the local drag group, They run weekly shows typically at Crown of Comedy in Auburn, and Sneak and Dawdle in Opelika. Their shows (And other queer events) get posted to this facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/AOQueerLife\n\nThere\u2019s no local LGBT Clubs or bars, but Coffee Mafia is a local coffee shop whos a massive supporter of of Pride on the Plains and the local community. The owner, Ian is also a drag queen. They host local craft shows and a monthly poetry reading night too! I highly recommend getting an \u201cIced Crack\u201d which is their coldbrew drink. https://auburncoffeemafia.com/ https://www.facebook.com/auburncoffeemafia/\n\nIf your a student or involved in the University at all, There\u2019s the office of Diversity and Inclusion which hosts events on campus and just opened a Pride Center in Haley, and there\u2019s 2 on-campus organizations: Spectrum and oSTEM.",

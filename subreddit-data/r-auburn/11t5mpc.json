Just look at the slap on the wrist he got as punishment. A 500$ fine with no restitution to the victim and a suspended jail sentence. If I had to guess the city is PISSED at the municipal judge finding him guilty. I love the city of Auburn and still reside here but this buddy system of politics will always exist because of the political ties these businesses have with the system. The mayor Ron Anders ran and operated a business just next door to this bar for like 30 years. Do you really think this is a coincidence??",

While I do not know him on a personal level, I do however have in-person interactions with him on an occasional basis because of the work I do. I have never had a negative interaction with him, but I do get the feeling that he plays the game, as any politician does. The point I was trying to make is that money goes a long way in influencing decisions like this. The city makes an incredible amount of money in tax revenue from this bar. The fact that the owner has had virtually no punishment for this crime (aside from having to register as a sex offender as required by law with no wiggle room) is mind-blowing. This dude has had a MAJOR reputation for decades. Yes, I know everything you hear is not always true, but when stuff like this comes out it goes to show that some of the things were in fact true. The point is that the good ole boy system is real and that people like this looking out for each other is absolutely a possibility. I'd be very interested to know if the owners have ever made any political contributions to any of his campaigns or causes. Also, Ander's Book Store has not been gone for 8 years, they closed last year lol, not that it really matters.",

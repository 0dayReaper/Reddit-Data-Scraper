Because in modern America, an America that has taken a new stance on sexuality(LGBTQ) and race (CRT), it is ever more important for parents to become cognizant and aware of their children's education and how their brain is being sculpted today than it ever was.",

I'm sorry if you feel bad that  you may likely have indirectly benefited from the slave trade or if your ancestors were confederate soldiers that fought to protect the states rights (that people could keep slaves). But looking back through a place of knowledge and moral (as you specify is so important) high ground we know these people were in the wrong and should acknowledge these grievous  mistakes that were made against people of color. This should include the slave trade, the Jim crow era, and civil rights, along with other ways our society discriminates against people of color.\n\nI hope my children are fortunate enough to learn this in school if not I will teach them myself.",

I'm saying critical race theory shouldn't be taught in schools. Because it's wrong. As discussed with Thomas Sowell. Blacks were effect by slavery sure, but the effect is not as Jurrasic as displayed in the media. Sowell argues that many black groups that didn't grow around cracker culture had succeeded greatly contrary to blacks who also suffered from slavery but were influenced by cracker culture. Whether you are liberal or conservative, it's a fascinating video. Sowell also wrote a great book on the topic called \"White Liberals and Black Conservatives\"   [https://youtu.be/BjWTK1D0TM4](https://youtu.be/BjWTK1D0TM4) \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT4NQ9D0M6w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT4NQ9D0M6w)",

Y'all are constantly being misled to take less than you are worth while lining the pockets of rich capitalist elites that profit off of American suffering.\n\nI'm assuming you and your parents work hard and are proud of the work or effort you contribute to society, your costs for goods and services have gone up while your pay likely may not have kept pace, your told you live in the best country in the world especially in terms of health care but fear riding in an ambulance or going to the hospital because you know that the bill (if you don't have good health insurance) may likely be financially crippling, you know if you are younger you may likely never see your social security money when you reach retirement age, you likely will struggle to afford a home if you don't already own one as home prices and rent are currently soaring.\n\nThroughout all of this CEOs and the other 1% are profiting like never before and the income gap is widening. Increasing taxes on those top 1% (many who are in that position due to generational wealth) could properly fund healthcare for all, better education for all (school choice vouchers should not be a choice as it promotes segregation and racism through exclusionary practices and removes state oversight of schools while also typically providing less educated instructors) including trade schools technical colleges, community colleges, and state (but not private) colleges (this gives everyone regardless of their families or parents economic situation a path to success), investments in sustainable energy and agriculture (which generate further economic growth and job development), and social programs that provide safety nets for those that need them including disability and social security (but not Medicare or Medicaid as single payer healthcare covers that).\n\nJesus was very much about helping the sick, those in need, and educating the people on how to help themselves.\n\nThese things can all be funded with revising the tax code so that everyone including billionaires and the top 1% pays their fair share.\n\nThis is far from the drag queens and kings discussion but I believe all I addressed here is like counter to your worldview as well.",

Not any that I know of, because CRT is largely taught in Colleges like the University of Columbia, Harvard, UCLA, Berkeley, NYU, etc...Regarding Black and White Elites, what do you mean? Because from what I've learned, we want to destroy the elites who have their grubby hands over the government. We want Free Market Capitalism, void of corporations and career politicians' control. \n\nWell, I love the old healthcare argument. I'm gonna take the Ludwig Von Mises stance and tell you, we CANT afford healthcare. Because you know who would end up paying for said healthcare? THE LOWER CLASS. The upper won't care, the government won't budge, and WE will pay for those taxes. Truly, at some point or another, we WILL have to pay for it. Maybe not how you think, but our debt will come back and bite you back in the butt, and we'll have to pay for it. You'd have to have shallow macroeconomic knowledge to not know that. And yes, I hate how high getting something as small as stitches costs, screw big pharma, but it won't be any better. Because once we all get what we want, we WILL have another Great Depression (although it's looking like we'll have that regardless) because we cannot afford it!!! The taxpayers would end up paying for something like this, not the government. \n\nTake a look at Social Security for goodness sake. We can't even GET THAT (OASI Trust Fund) You and I, we won't get a penny. Not a penny. Why??? (ask me why) Because the government can't even afford to offer that. Since 2021, more money has been going OUT of the SSF than going IN. And that money that is actually in the SSF? Ha, yeah that's all loaned to the government. So,  projection says by 2033, we won't even have any money to take out of the SSF. So, prepare accordingly folks.\n\nSorry I got lost in economic ramble, but the point is, the US government paying for your healthcare is a fever dream. Can't even pay its people retirement money for goodness sake. I have a challenge for you, find a single governmental program in which the people who pay taxes have higher incomes than those who get the benefits.And what about the RICH paying for our healthcare? That sounds awesome! \n\nAgain, dude, it's ridiculous to take money from those who've worked to get that money. Like, it's the poor screaming give me your money! to those that have created their own wealth (largely) through entrepreneurship. Again, we are not in heaven, people don't get money for free (especially without consequences).\n\nLiberals often think PEOPLE are like chess pieces, and that people will change their beliefs as you change the tax rates. But by God, I can hear Milton Friedman rolling in his grave is that false PEOPLE REACT TO THESE TAXES.\n\nWatch this here, you tax the rich, you lose capital. WHERE ARE THE RICH GOING AFTER THESE TAX LAWS???? not the US. not the country that's doing the taxing. THEY'RE GONE. You lose industry, you lose cash flow, you lose JOBS, and you lose SO MUCH when you tax the rich. Because when the rich leave, you're economic stability leaves with them.For those that do stay, where is their money going? Tax-Free Securities. When you tax people, ESPECIALLY when you tax the rich, you see money move into tax-free assets and securities. You'll never see the money go into the hands of the lower class.\n\nYou are exactly right, Jesus was about helping the poor and the needy. I don't see how that is an argument against me.Brother, I love these conversations. Fire away!",

Both predictions were supported, although homosexual women preferred older partners than expected. Results suggest that age and sex preferences develop independently.\"\n\n Literally men regardless of sexuality preferred younger partners, the pictures they showed were also 18-60 year olds not children. So all men are the problem (I am a man)? Also while I am not attracted to those more than a few years younger to me (~35) it isn't illegal for 18 year olds to date other people around that age range or however old though I definitely think it should be frowned upon to date people much younger that are near 18 years old especially when there are power dynamics at play even though that too is not illegal.\n\nHomosexual women even preferred older individuals.\n\nAlso this \"study\" has only 192 participants, that's laughable and it's 23 years old.",

Just don't try to parent someone else's child or make the parenting decision for someone else.  \n\nIf this is a question of the government stepping in, they are going to have a helluva a time with Mobile, Bay Minette and New Orleans (not to mention Auburn with their Krewe de Tigre) around Mardi Gras, because folks in parades dress in all kinds of fashion, including drag. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Most parades also feature cheerleaders from local highschools, though, so I suppose they don't fit the bill of \"literal adults\" (which I would argue is worse). \n\nThe nice thing about any kind of performance/art, is that you don't have to engage with it at all if you don't want to. No one will force you to go to a drag show, attend any parade, watch the latest Marvel movie, or go to a football game. Have a great day!",

VBS takes place to teach children about God, teach them morals, and how to become righteous people. While pride parades and drag queen events, well, tell me if I'm wrong, but their reason for the organization is to present how different and unique they are from the world, and how they ought 'be themselves'. Like, nice, good for you but what's being celebrated is wrong biblically and can be wrong materially",

I don't understand the need for drag shows to be had in front of small children. If you can, help me understand why that is so important....\n\nYOU are the one spreading hate. I came to discuss the issue with an open mind and now am going to be called whatever -phobic and -ist is the en vogue expression because I didn't immediately support every aspect of the event. \n\nYou are the one being closed minded and hating me because we don't agree.\n\nGrow up",

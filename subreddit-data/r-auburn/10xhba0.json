    "postText": "The honors college at auburn is something I really want to be a part of while at auburn. Auburn invited me for a tour of the honors college as part of the very impressive tigers program. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s Becuase I have a pretty high SAT, but my gpa is relatively low. I\u2019m confused on why they would even offer a tour for me if I don\u2019t even meet the minimum requirement. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s Becuase most kids who meet one requirement generally meet the other. Do you think there\u2019s still any other possible way to get into their honors college or is it out of the picture?",

If you want the rigor, spend time learning about things in your field that employers want instead of chasing participation trophies offered by Auburn. \n\nSpecifically one of my advisors explicitly advised against joining. Just my 2 cents tho",

It's a pretty massive waste of time, as employers couldn't care less and grad schools will care exponentially more about things like publications, research experience, etc. My recommendation is to spend your time doing things that will help you get a job or into grad school (or just having fun).",

Auburn has always been great at recruiting and continually provided honest feedback throughout my entire recruitment process, even past acceptance.

It\u2019s not necessarily \u201cprestigious\u201d but the professors teaching honors classes are 99% of the time better than those teaching the regular version of the course. Also, Week of Service forms a super tight community and I\u2019d recommend it as a great way to make friends. Best of luck, and message me if you have any questions!",

    "postText": "Hey y'all, this may be a little early, but I am a current freshman and am trying to get off-campus housing set up for next year.  Looking for places for 4 people and &lt;$800 a month each, doesn't have to be super close to campus.  While searching on my own I found the Hub, but it seems like that is a really bad option from what I have read online so far.  The other place I was thinking about was Eagles Landing, which seems really solid albeit it seems a little difficult to get housing there and nobody picked up the phone when I called earlier.\n\nAll advice for this process is welcome as I've never really done this before and if y'all have any recommendations(Or places to avoid) for off-campus housing they are welcome. Thanks!\n\nEdit: This is for next Fall",

Trains go through Auburn 4-5 times a day and they blare the horn when they do. \nTo give you an idea, you could hear train horns at Taco Bell on S Gay at night time sometimes so it\u2019s very loud if you live close by.\nIf you all do not mind driving a little, I\u2019d look up liberty properties. They have 400 a month for 4 people. \nPersonally, I stayed with 2 other people while paying 350 each and the only downside I could think of was that it was a little far from everything (NorthPointe cir is where it was) \nKeep in mind, unless you pay over 1000\u2019s on rent or stay in newly built apartments, your apt/house will have some problems. \nI think this is typical for college town",

It seems like they're attempting to turn the place around, but based on all kinds of stuff that has happened in the last couple of years, I'd avoid it. Let's just say, parking lot fights, cops there multiple times a week, gun shots, and, not as bad, but the place is pot hole city.Yugo, Mill, Beacon, Samford, Magnolia, and Evergreen are unfortunately best to avoid. I've heard Logan Square is alright, same with The Grove.\n\nCreekside is also really nice, have some friends that lived there and it was pretty nice. Sometimes a bit loud but that's about it. It's a little out of price range though, depending on the floor plan from what I've seen. I also saw where someone recommended renting a house instead, honestly not a bad idea if you can find one with enough bedrooms.",

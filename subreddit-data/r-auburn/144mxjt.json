Those are definitely an infestation and they\u2019re there to stay if you don\u2019t do something about them. If you can, get a picture of them. Figure out the species, and double down with your landlord. They\u2019ll be a problem even after you\u2019re gone if he doesn\u2019t do something about them.",

Back when I lived in one of their properties, we had a huge rat in one of our bathrooms that we had to kill by ourselves because they dragged their feet on sending someone out to take care of it. Then, it took them 3 months to send someone out to patch up the hole where the rat chewed through the bathroom wall, even though I called them at least once a week to ask when it would be fixed. \n\nMy wife also rented from them back then, and part of her bathroom floor caved in once and you could see the foundation of the building through the hole, and they wrote it off as \u201cnot a big deal\u201d until her dad called First Realty and demanded that they fix it immediately if they wanted their rent money. They came out very soon after her dad called, but it shouldn\u2019t take that much to fix a problem that big.",

    "postText": "This is mainly for the gamers out there since I know pretty much any internet would be decent for school work. But for playing games I would definitely be more picky. Currently at my parents house I have AT&amp;T fiber optic which has been pretty good so far not even connecting anything through LAN and just using WIFI. Currently looking at that or Verizon, I don\u2019t have a phone plan through a carrier so I wouldn\u2019t get any bundle discounts.",

They have since improved their infrastructure and I very rarely ever have outages. I almost always get really good speeds as well. Used to play a lot of COD and always had good ping times. As the others have said, stay away from cellular providers as they will be terrible for gaming.",

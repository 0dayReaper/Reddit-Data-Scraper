I love that in a restaurant. I don't always want my mind blown, I just want some solid simple good stuff. That's why I have faith in this place and I actually try and go whenever I have a special occasion. I've learned to eat there outside of busy hours though and maybe that has tainted my opinion. Happy hour meals are outstanding there, the cooks are talented and when given the time to make your food, it's definitely going to be awesome.",

Both have prime locations, both have a lot of the football/basketball coaches and other staffers come in after for faculty dinner. \n\nThe stuffy/pretentious would definitely fit Acre better than Hamilton's, everyone there is pretty chill, and their meals are a lot cheaper on average than Acre's unless they've lowered their prices. \n\nBut honestly this could also be a shot at Amsterdam Cafe, that would probably be my best guess. Old location, been there forever, rich old money owners, mediocre to average food at best.",

Yes, it's not \"cheap\" food, but it's straight forward and in all the times I have gone there, I've received exactly what I expected and enjoyed it thoroughly. If I go and order the seafood dish or the steak, I always get a clean and good plate which is just as described. I like that they aren't giving off any kind of vibe that they're reinventing the wheel, or \"modernizing\" southern food...it's just nice cuts of good stuff with wholesome sides. I can't hate that. \n\nI have been to Acre for dinner twice and was disappointed both times. They have a higher-brow concept as far as their cuisine goes, but I remember seeing a lot of dirty neglected corners in the restaurant and unfortunately the same corner-cutting came through on my plate. It's great ideas, which seem to be executed without the original genius behind them on the line, which equals double disappointment. I'd rather get a properly cooked piece of grouper with simple broccoli and rice and beurre blanc that is exactly how it should be, than a reimagined twisted up conceptual meal which isn't done right and costs even more.",

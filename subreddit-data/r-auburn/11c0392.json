    "postText": "I\u2019m an upcoming freshman starting next year in the fall and plan on majoring in software engineering. I talked to a couple of students and one said to go with windows because certain macs have trouble running the software, and you end up using a VM. The other said to get a mac, just not an m1 or m2. I was considering getting a MacBook Air or pro, just without either of those chips. Anyone have any recommendations or opinions?",

The biggest point is get something you will be comfortable carrying around. I have a gaming laptop and it was hella annoying carrying it around and also always bringing the charger bc it couldn\u2019t stay alive. It\u2019s also awkward whipping out a massive gaming laptop for notes. When you get to upper elective classes, it may be more beneficial to have windows and something with more computing power, but that really depends on what you do.",

            "comment": "OP, I'm an AU CSSE grad, a senior software engineer at a tech company, and I'm married to another software engineer in big tech. I have no idea what these \"Windows is better for programming\" people are talking about. macOS' Unix base gives it a strong advantage over Windows, as it's easier to use (on command line) and more compatible out-of-the-box with various tools, languages, libraries, etc. There's a reason that essentially every tech company you've heard of (save for Microsoft, of course) issues Macs to their SWEs. Some (like my former employer) even require you to fill out a special request with justification if you want a Windows machine. My current work machine is an M1 MBP and I've had no issues. My wife's work computer (at a different company, on an entirely different stack, language, etc.) is also an M1 and she has had zero issues.\n\nIf you're interested in game development, Windows is certainly the better choice (and/or for .NET development, but I doubt that's a consideration as an incoming student, lol). If you have aspirations of doing any iOS or macOS development, you'll need a Mac as Xcode only runs on macOS.\n\nSomeone's note below that Macs last a long time is definitely true as well. My first two lasted almost 10 years. There's always the argument that you only need it to last through school, at which point you can buy something more expensive for the long-haul. The one caveat for school is that yeah, you'll need Windows for your assembly language class and that could prove to be a challenge with an Mx chip.\n\nRegardless, good luck with your schooling and War Eagle!",

                    "comment": "I'm a SWE + ECE grad that's in a similar situation as a senior SWE at a tech company and I agree with most of what you said. I recommend that OP also considers dual-booting a Windows device into Linux. This will bring all of the programming advantages of a Unix system, while also allowing OP to switch to Windows for any class software that is specific to Windows. A big advantage of this approach is that you can typically save a lot of money (pretty important in college) on the laptop you buy while getting comparable hardware specs.\n\nUltimately OP, you should focus on getting a laptop that you're comfortable using and that fits your price range. Everything else you can reasonably figure out as you go, regardless of OS.",

From a \"daily use as a college student\" standpoint not so much, but I suppose that's what windows is for. I just personally wouldn't want my primary dev env to be so sequestered from the rest of my daily use. It'd be cheaper than a Mac, though.",

Of course there are ways to import the file in Mac but windows is simply so intuitive, you didn\u2019t need a tutorial to do a simple import.\n\nI explained why people in tech companies uses Macs. Macs generally have extremely good processing speed and battery life. On windows, it has to be a choice between the two, you can get a gaming laptop that might even do better than Macs but it\u2019d be at the expense of battery life.",

Windows\u2019 command line is significantly clunkier than Unix\u2019.\n\nYou ought to do some research into what effects the Unix base of macOS has on terminal functionality and its general compatibility/operability with common programming tools and libraries. The benefits are a lot more than \u201cspeed and battery life.\u201d In fact, I\u2019d say that those are the least impactful reasons why pros use macOS.",

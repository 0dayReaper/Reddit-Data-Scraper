            "comment": "I used to fly fish it years ago with a plain old 5 weight. Caught a decent number of fish, mostly using small wet flies of various types. I did once catch about a 3lb bass below the waterfall, which shocked both me and the other people that happened to be around that day. Shortly after catching that fish I proceeded to backcast into a tree in front of a geology class of like thirty people. That last part isn\u2019t relevant to your question, but I felt morally obligated to tell the full story.",

The creek that feeds into that bottom area opposite of the waterfall is from the quarry and usually has a lot of sunfish but not many bass. You can also wade fish down the main creek a good bit to get away from the crowd that will be using the creek below the falls. Ultralight gear works best. Either small minnow imitations, crawfish, small plastics, or poppers. Good luck!",

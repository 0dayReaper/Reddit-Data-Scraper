I used to go from 1030pm or later and it would be dead and now it\u2019s been squeezed back an hour and there\u2019s loads more students. 530am - 11:00am is a good time if you\u2019re a morning person, otherwise don\u2019t get in there before 9:00pm if you don\u2019t want to wait on equipment. I\u2019ve had to wait for equipment more than a few times at 10pm on a weekday, so I\u2019ve started preferring the mornings.",

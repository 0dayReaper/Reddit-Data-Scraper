I am certain there are a number of aviation scholarships, but I wouldn\u2019t rely on them until you see that they have been offered. If you are curious if they regularly award large scholarships, such as the 4 year and $5,000/year engineering scholarship, I would recommend contacting a counselor in the aviation department.",

Dealing with underground access is like that. It's very easy to catch a pocket of methane gas build up or low oxygen. You won't even know what happened but you will black out. This is especially true during the springtime and summer time after a rain when it gets really hot. If you're going to do it, at least have the proper equipment and be careful",

At minimum emergency med kit,flashlight and backup for each person, oxygen sensor and helmets. Chemical light sticks are also highly suggested.",

We went after a bit of a dry spell when the air was cool, and I would never go in there alone. If probing any further in we would probably switch things up to be even more careful.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m looking to move during summer/fall so I\u2019m looking for options early. My budget really is anything below $500 a month, I can do 550 if it\u2019s really good.\nIs there a decent place I can get for that amount? I\u2019m not looking for much, just somewhere really to campus (I don\u2019t have a car), laundry (either in unit or for the entire building) and no crazy neighbors (I\u2019d prefer a building with few apartments).\n\nI\u2019m an international student if that matters and I don\u2019t have a pet.\n\nEdit: does any have any information on The view? The apartment along N Donahue. Can\u2019t find information on price online.",

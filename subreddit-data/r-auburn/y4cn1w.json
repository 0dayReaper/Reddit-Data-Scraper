Old row took over the next year and was able to bring it back closer to what it was 2016-before. Still will never be the same as it was at the old rodeo arena by good ole boys, but the new places have worked out well and with space constraints there's only so much they can do. \n\nFor it being in April vs fall, it used to be the big Spring event. Now old row is doing it twice a year, which imo will lead to two smaller events instead of the one gigantic one that people think of. They're also trying to copy it at Georgia will which have an effect as well- rodeo always had people from all over the southeast in town for it so I don't know why they want a copy 3 hours away, it wasn't uncommon to see hundreds of students from as far as florida, kentucky, or uva at rodeo. Again, bad planning imo but old row just wants to milk it for more money-i get it. \n\nAlso last I checked alpha psi wasn't even on campus as of a couple years ago, I think it had to do with having low membership which makes sense-rodeo was a mega fundraiser and it was all vet students",

I was a regular attendee between 2006-2012 but my first was 99 i think? We used to stop at the gas station on the way there and grab tickets for $10. Not long after I moved away I saw they were only available online and the price had increased drastically. I\u2019m not sure if they got too big for their britches or what but it sounds absolutely nothing like how it was. Things change I guess, they can be having drunk teenagers ride broncs anymore. \n\nAlso surprised  to hear about Alpha Psi - didn\u2019t they have a big new house (new as in 2010) up above the dorms? I watched the 2013 Iron Bowl there and you could hear the stadium like you were there. Damn, didn\u2019t realize the rodeo was keeping them alive.",

They had a brand new smaller house at the end of old row across from KA, I think it's now STG since sigma chi came back and moved back into their house. Biggest issue was insurance with attendance consistently getting up over 15,000 people and the bands becoming huge acts (ex: I saw Brad Paisley one year and Alan Jackson anotherbetween 14-16, I think 12 was Eric church at his peak). It was basically uninsurable as it was while being run by college kids, even if they're in grad school. \n\nI mean without any big events it's tough to keep numbers up, especially when talking about a professional vet fraternity that coexists with the typical undergrad fraternities.",

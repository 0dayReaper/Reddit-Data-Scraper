They deserve our support. Pack out Neville Arena tomorrow night. \n\nStudents: There won\u2019t be a line. Get there when you want to. You\u2019ll get a seat. Take a 2 hour break. \n\nSeason ticket holders: if you can\u2019t come, give away your ticket or sell it. Don\u2019t let it go to waste. \n\nBruce needs our help. We don\u2019t need to act like a bunch of spoiled Bama football fans. We need to support our guys.",

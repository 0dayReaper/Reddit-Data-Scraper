            "comment": "I have found the AU Med Clinic to be pretty good overall but I will say that it can be hard to get them on the phone and the wait to see an actual MD vs an NP or PA is usually kinda long. That said, the clinicians there have been very friendly and understanding and I imagine that they would be the same to you as well. Personally, I have been very happy with the care I have received from the PAs there. They've been much nicer than any GP MD I've seen in the past. Clinicians 4.5/5. Rest of the staff 3/5. A lot of doctor's offices are like that though, so I don't mind too much.",

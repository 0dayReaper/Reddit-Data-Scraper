            "comment": "I moved out three years ago, and while I liked the apartment itself I did not like a few things:\n\n-how infrequent they sprayed for bugs. I would almost always see cockroaches on the landing right outside my door and they would sometimes try and run in. I sprayed my apartment myself to avoid them coming inside. \n-I don\u2019t know if they still do this but they did quarterly inspections in which they would give an entire month window that they could come into your apartment at any time to inspect it. Not being able to prepare to have a stranger come into my house gave me so much anxiety. \n-also I just didn\u2019t like living across from the dump, because they would occasionally set that dang thing on fire and everything would be covered in soot and little bits of plastic. \n\nThat being said, again, I really did like the apartment. They have nice pools and their workout room is pretty good. Its a pretty decent price compared to some other places. It\u2019s quiet there, and out of the way. However. I prefer living closer to the tiger town/mall side of town because there\u2019s more options for shopping and groceries.",

            "comment": "It's pretty good, amenities are nice: pool, hot tub, sauna, rec room, tanning beds, free golf etc. Apartments are big for the price compared to elsewhere. Maintenance is top notch, never had an issue they didn't at least investigate within a day or two. Only thing I've really had a problem with is some mold, but it's not terrible and easy to keep at bay if you keep your stuff clean. Very dog friendly, I see them around all the time. Keep in mind that openings for an apartment go quick and usually they only have openings in August unless they have someone leave early. Best to get on the wait list soon. They'll give you a tour if you go to the office and say you're interested, most of the people who work there also live there so they can really give you an idea of what it's like as well.",

It seemed to be a safe neighborhood. We had free access to the golf course. The pool was really nice. It's right next to the interstate, which made it convenient to get around. My experience there was quite nice.",

            "comment": "Just moved my son in this weekend. Nice place. Starting to get a tad dated but they are making a ton of new buildings. Very nice amenities though. Free golf, pool, tanning beds, etc. Having been at Auburn a while back I knew about the bug issues. Sprayed as soon as I got there hoping it will keep them at bay but it is not that much of a pain. The only real draw back was that it is near a waste water treatment plant and when the wind is blowing in your direction it can smell pretty bad outside. We were there 3 days and only noticed it once. Might want to make sure you get a building far away from there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would recommend though, fairly highly.",

You get two notices for inspections now. Maybe two weeks before and then usually they leave a note for the day before. I have a ring camera and they are in and out in like less than 3 mins. But it\u2019s very quiet &amp; a great place for dogs! I have not been bothered at all by the office since I\u2019ve been here and maintenance comes pretty fast.",

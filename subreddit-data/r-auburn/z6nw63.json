    "postText": "I have a full time, 7:00-3:30 five days a week, job that I\u2019m happy with. But between rent, utilities, phone, and new truck payment, I only have enough each month to make all of my payments so I want a little extra to start saving more. Not looking for anything strenuous as my full time job is in construction. I guess you could say I\u2019m looking for an easy job but with that I know will be close to minimum wage pay - which is fine. Anyone know of anything?",

Could also do the instacart shopping thing. Beyond that you could work a couple evenings in restaurants, but that isn\u2019t easy and you would be on your feet most likely, same with grocery stores.",

We're hiring in the kitchen as well but I'm not sure kitchen work falls into the definition of easy. I'm not sure if we're still doing it but references that last 90 days get the new hire and the person who referenced them $100, so DM me if you're interested.",

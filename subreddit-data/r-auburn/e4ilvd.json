It sounds great, the music during time outs is crystal clear, the problem is that they can't use it during the actual game and unless they are doing bama karaoke nobody makes any noise.  We were in Starkville for the Egg Bowl.  That place is friggin' nuts.  Those cowbells are obnoxiously loud and when they quit ringing them when play resumes they crowd just natually continues the noise.",

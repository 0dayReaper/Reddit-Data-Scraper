My buddy took the in-person class last summer, he can only do it with the professor in class, and there was no video for him to review.\n\nNo matter which professor, it is a huge amount of homework and repeated practice.\n\nBut as long as you keep up with the schedule, it is very easy to get n A in this class.",

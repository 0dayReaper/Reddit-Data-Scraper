More annoying than when the electric skateboarding became a sorta common thing. At least it's not like big cities with Bird and Lime. Those things are a plague on walkable public areas. Gotta pray to the gods that the city never lets that happen.",

Imagine a 250lb guy hitting someone going 20mph on a metal scooter. That and some guy on an electric skateboard cut in front of me and I missed him by 2 ft, he was going significantly more than the scooters, I\u2019d bet around 25-30 on a sidewalk and crosswalk.",

Most towns/cities don't have designated bike lanes so this usually leads to issues. Pedestrians have the right of way in 9/10 situations. It comes down to everyone being respectful towards one another.   \n\n\nIf an e-scooter has to be on the sidewalk because no bike lane is available then they shouldn't be going more than 10-15 mph and following pedestrian rules. They shouldn't run stop signs/red lights as you often see.",

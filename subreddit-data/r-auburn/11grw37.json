We skied from about 2pm until near-dark 3-5 days a week during spring and summer quarters.  Not that crowded in the 70\u2019s:  No jet skis; mostly slow fishing boats.  Gas was (usually) cheap.  Didn\u2019t have much money but it went a long way.  For use of their boat, I bought the gas and made minor boat / motor repairs myself.  Wonderful times on the water at LM  while at AU !!",

    "postText": "We are looking for people interested in trying out D&amp;D (Dungeons and Dragons) that have not played before. We have an experienced Dungeon Master that is interested in helping new players learn how to play through a short 3-4 session campaign. We'll be playing at Game Time Hobbies (3909 Pepperell Pkwy Suite E Opelika, AL 36801) half a mile or so from the Auburn Mall on Thursday Nights from 6-9 pm once we fill out the group. There are four spots available and kids are welcome to play as well although it's not a kid focused group. There is no cost to participate. Please post or PM me if interested and I can provide you with contact information for the Dungeon Master.",

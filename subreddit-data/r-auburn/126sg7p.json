    "postText": "Hi all, thank you all for the information you have given me previously. Hopefully this is my last rental post. \n\nI\u2019m a grad student coming down from Alaska so I will not have the chance to tour any places myself, and I\u2019d like to secure a lease sooner than later. \n\nMag1 looks pretty awesome. $950 studio right next to campus. Anyone have any experience here? Recommend it? Is there any quiet time there? Would be nice to be able to walk everywhere. \n\nLakewood Commons and The Greens are my two other choices. I already have a deposit with Greens but they won\u2019t be able to give me a for sure lease until May or June which is a bit of a ways out for me. \n\nAny information on the Mag1 or your opinion out of these 3 would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much. \n\n\nCan\u2019t wait to start my time at Auburn. War Eagle!",

I've known grad students who have gone with Cavell Court on Magnolia.   With Cavell, you'd be trading off modern renovations for a discount on price and a roomier 2-room apartment (separate bedroom).  A bit on the dumpy side, but it's international grad student heavy, so it's quiet usually.  Real close proximity to downtown.  Under $600/month, too.",

If you would have told me before the game that Auburn would only make 7 3s today but would beat us, I\u2019d say you\u2019re crazy. I think that\u2019s the most impressive thing about today\u2019s W besides being down Okeke. \n\nCongrats again on the Final Four but don\u2019t stop there. Win the damn thing! ",

I'm looking for a book called elementary principles of chemical engineering the 4 the edition. I was hoping I could buy it second hand.",

You might ask if they will warn you when a quiz is coming up so you can print the material to have in class instead of having a computer. It\u2019s not ideal, but it\u2019s better than buying a whole book. Hopefully they won\u2019t be a huge hard ass about it.\n\nI had chemistry professor, who insisted on physically writing the notes in class on an old school overhead by hand. She refused to provide copies of the notes after the fact because you were expected to write quickly and keep up. Some of us don\u2019t but whatever. She insisted that was the best way to learn. Well, it wasn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t do well in that class, and she was eventually removed from teaching because students were doing so poorly in her classes",

I can also neither confirm or deny how one might just print the parts of the book needed for class based on the syllabus and sell it at a discount to other students early in the semester.\n\nEdit: saving to pdf may or may not also work for books that give a 7 day or 14 day trial period",

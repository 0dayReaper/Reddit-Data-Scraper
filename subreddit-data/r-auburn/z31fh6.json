In my seminar class, we had to give several presentations and in-class discussions, so the presentations weren\u2019t that big of a hit on the grade. Is there not a syllabus provided for your seminar class?",

But not everyone is good at public speaking and giving presentations, what matters is the content you gave and hopefully they can see that. Maybe you could reach out to them and ask for a re-do in a more private setting and maybe they could average the evaluations? (Assuming you got bad evaluations, which I doubt)!",

Even now, my hardest try is little less than everyone's average.\n\nI had a friend who played drank alcohol met friends traveled. He graduated the AU mech engr (which is hard really hard) in 4yr without even taking summer courses.\n\nWith all A\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\njust different for everyone.",

All your basic chems, calculus classes, physics, english, etc. needs to be A\u2019s. That sets you up for your more difficult classes being B\u2019s or C\u2019s. If you struggle to make above a 3.5 in your first two semesters, i\u2019d question if chemical engineering is for you. The classes only get harder, and the amount of coursework only gets heavier. \n\nBest of luck to you if you decide to embark on the challenge. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Auburn and am happy I took the ChemE route all the way through.",

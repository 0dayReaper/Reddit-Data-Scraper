    "postText": "Hi all, \nI\u2019m looking to start up an indie rock/psychedelic rock project, originals and covers together. \nWe\u2019re based in both Auburn and Dadeville, AL. We\u2019re both 18, so being close in that age range would be preferable. Influences include Wilco, The Beatles, Nick Drake, Tom Petty, The Doors, Big Star, Syd Barrett/Pink Floyd, etc. \nI have a lead guitarist. I\u2019m on lead vocals and rhythm guitar/occasional lead guitar. \nWe could use a keyboardist, bassist, and a drummer. \nPM me or comment if you are interested. \nPeace out, \nRyan",

I\u2019ve been in several bands and I think he has too.\nI used to be in a psychedelic rock band called Hazy Daze, which broke up in February 2021 and Drunken Phoenix, a more hard rock cover band that wasn\u2019t exactly my cup of tea. I was let go from that group in February 2022.",

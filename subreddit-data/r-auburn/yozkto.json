    "postText": "Hi. I'm a freshman software engineering major and I have no idea what I am doing. I'm fine with school, I have good grades. But I have no friends. I came from a very small high school and nobody from my school came to Auburn with me. I live my life in a lonely routine and I'm not someone who really puts myself out there much. In social terms, I have no idea what I'm doing. I don't know what groups I would fit into, and they honestly seem a little daunting on the first place. It's hard socializing when everyone walks with their headphones on, and talking to other people in classes or campus just seems really forced. If any of yall have a group you may consider inviting me to, or giving me suggestions on where to go, I would appreciate it and may consider it.",

It got so much better my sophomore year because I made one friend and it blossomed from there. I think a lot of other people here have given you some good advice, but just know that I survived and you will, too. \n\nAs for finding things you like, I think most people like playing video games. If the gaming area in the student center is still as busy as it was when I was there, pop in between classes. Ask to join a game. However if you don\u2019t like video games, my other suggestion would be to volunteer. You\u2019ll feel good giving back, and it\u2019ll be easy to talk with people.",

It\u2019s easy to get down on yourself in this position, but it\u2019s just something to work through and grow from.\n\nMain word of advice I can give is don\u2019t say no or shy away from a seemingly benign conversation or opportunity. It\u2019s amazing what you can get into even outside of organized groups (I ended up getting into freerunning and bouldering somehow). Don\u2019t just put your headphones in and bury your head in your phone while you\u2019re walking around or sitting waiting for your next class. Just walk around and take in the atmosphere that a lot of people post-college are jealous of you for. Those flyers they\u2019re handing out on the concourse for random events? Go to one!\n\nGet into something like SAE Baja, Formula, etc. Perfect mix of socialization and extracurricular engineering activities (I wasn\u2019t a mechanical major either). If you\u2019re like me, you just need a shared goal and the social aspect follows. The daunting aspect of starting something is removed when you just pick one and go (just do it, if you will). \n\nI ended up having a blast and making a lot of good friends along the way, and I know you will too. \n\nJust do it.",

Some people won't respond but some will. Once you know them a little bit you can always ask if they are going to anything over the weekend or know of anything fun going on and just say you're looking to find something to do and see if you can tag along. \n\nSome people have more success with clubs than others, or signing up for some rec league sports as a free agent and getting to know the team. Just depends what you're into.\n\nEdit: I also came from a small school (&lt;100 in graduating class) and will tell you a lot is just seeing the same people often and initiating small talk. See someone at the rec you've had multiple classes with? Maybe ask them for a spot and drop in a \"hey you're in so and so's class right?\" and go from there. Again, don't know you so can't say that specific scenario works, but once you get a couple friends it's way easier to find more and get a strong group going. The toughest part is starting",

I had a ton of my hometown friends come with me to Auburn but that didn\u2019t last long (they became assholes and intentionally left me out). So for a little before the fallout, and especially after, I had no one to hang out with. \n\nSince then I became a bartender over in Opelika. And it has been one of the best choices I ever made. Like you, I had poor social skills and approaching people was hard. Bartending forced me to interact with people and I became comfortable with doing it. Now I have a good group of friends, a good social life, and a healthy lifestyle (not all accredited to the job, but a lot of it). \n\nMy best advice would be to work in a similar environment that I did AND/OR be in an environment you enjoy. I saw this bit of advise that said the best way to make friends is to show up to a place that interests you on a consistent basis. If you do, you are bound to make some friends and start networking. \n\nKeep your head up and work on yourself! It\u2019s easy to expect people to approach you and be disappointed when they don\u2019t. Focus on bettering yourself and the rest will come. All the best &lt;3",

Like the poster says, the system itself is not built to bring people together.\n\nEvery freshman class is a lecture one hundred people deep where integration is not encouraged. And this is a huge issue because going back to grade school that's where interactions happen and where you seemingly make connections and friends. Without this, many people don't know quite what to do.\n\nPeople eat by themselves, go to the rec by themselves, go the library alone and then just kind of repeat hoping something will change. And the catch is that going up to random people and saying \u201cHey\u201d\u00a0is frowned upon.\n\nI'm not saying it's impossible to make friends or connections. There's AU Involve, but like someone else said, to a person, most of those feel gimmicky and curriculum driven. Someone else said AU Involve is *the answer* and that's just not true. \n\nThe point is that, *systematically,* it should be extremely easy to make organic connections in a tiny town where thirty thousand plus students live, and that is just not the case.",

Marching band and Smash Bros Melee have let me meet a bunch of different people and it's been a great experience so far my freshman year. Yes I know both require background knowledge and prior involvement, but really I think the opportunities to meet people and make friends are out there past Greek Life. You just need to put yourself out there. Literally everyone I run into can relate about Fantasy football struggles or complaining about Auburn football (Cadillac is my GOAT though).\n\nI will say the day-day life at Auburn can seem a little lonely, but I've made friends with my hallmates and we have our own great group of friends just by being friendly on that first day of move-in.",

It was 2 years of building my world around her and now I lost my world. With the way everything happened, it makes me believe she was getting attention from other guys that she didn't usually get attention from at our small high school, especially since she plays such a masculine instrument.\n\nShe made new friends and she was my only friend, because I was still new to Auburn. But she held that against me and decided that she shouldn't be with me. We literally went on a trip to Alaska together less than a month before the breakup. She is still in my head and I need people to help me forget, or come to an acceptance that the past is the past.\n\nI know it could've been worse. It could've been a failed marriage with kids. I know 2 years seems like nothing compared to other people. It still hurts. It doesn't take away the fact that I am still lonely. I can't stand to say it hurts when things only ever seem to get worse.\n\nBlah blah blah, plenty of fish in the sea....

I want to tell you my experience with something similar. \nWhen I was dating someone, everything seemed amazing on the outside. We were great together, everyone marveled our relationship and we both thought we would make it. One day, I\u2019m not lying, I woke up and suddenly I felt sick to my stomach and everything came flooding over me at once. Everything he criticized me for, I laughed off or just kept quiet because I didn\u2019t want to make an argument out of things. I wanted for him to be happy! But he didn\u2019t give me a space to feel comfortable enough to open up\u2026 so I felt stifled. Add onto the fact that he was being isolated from everyone except for me so I felt like I was responsible for his happiness. Everything I kept to myself came to a head and I wasn\u2019t the person I used to be.\nI broke up with him right after our two year anniversary and he was really upset. Unfortunately for him, he showed me his true colors and acted in a way that made me realize I made the right choice. Then I started recalling all of the things he did that made me so uncomfortable (he would bash the things I loved to do and make me feel guilty for enjoying myself, he let his own misery allow himself to pull me down with him. And he didn\u2019t even realize it.) \nI feel for you, because I understood that you must be feeling the way that he did back then. The truth is that I have younger sisters, one who just went off to college. The way he treated me in front of people made me realize that one day it would get worse and I was absolutely miserable. I wanted to be an example for my sisters and brother and show them that sometimes you have to get out of a situation in a way that might not be right, but in the name of self-preservation it\u2019s necessary. The worst part is that I never gave him the closure that he needed to become a better partner in the future. Because he gave me every reason to not want to tell him. I wish I had been strong enough to be honest with him but he loved me for my docile nature for a reason. I told him it was because I wanted to experience life (I wanted to go to college and he couldn\u2019t have a serious conversation to save his life). \nI\u2019m telling you all of this because I want to try to give you the closure that you might need to understand that no one is intentionally cruel. It sounds like you really loved her and I bet all of your memories with her were authentic. If she was a kind person to you and you are this upset about losing her, she must have made you happy. It takes a lot of effort to make your partner happy at times so I hope you can eventually accept that she might\u2019ve left because she knew eventually it would\u2019ve ended a lot worse. I know many people in my situation and this is what I learned; sometimes people are willing to be the villain in your story in order to protect their peace and make it was painless as humanely possible for both parties. One day you\u2019ll look back and not see her in such a negative light and I hope you do because you deserve to think fondly of your past. I hope you find healing and can speak to someone and make some awesome college friends so that you aren\u2019t miserable. College is supposed to be fun! Try to enjoy it while you can!",

I was entirely dependent on him for emotional support and I was super miserable and lonely. One day he calls me and says he needs space. Doesn\u2019t talk to me for a month and when we finally talked on the phone he told me everything I ever did wrong and we fought for the first time in our whole relationship. He also started talking to someone else during that month of radio silence. It hurt so bad and after a while, I realized how toxic I was to him and I reached out and apologized. We has closure because I was able to listen without being defensive and it felt like a breath of fresh air. That hurt was still there but it wasn\u2019t as bad and got better over time.

It\u2019s really hard to make friends here if you aren\u2019t in greek life but not impossible, the great thing about freshmen year is that everyone is just as desperate for friends as you are so just try putting yourself out there",

I was a little concerned about him going to Auburn, as he's very introverted and Auburn is huge, but he has done well so far. There are lots of pop up events at the student center you can check out. He just went and decorated cookies the other night, for example, and went to a board game session last month. AU Involve is helpful, but can be overwhelming with choices. Like someone said above, maybe think about things you're interested in before going to the AU Involve site, or even things you think are really interesting and maybe want to try. My son is in engineering, and has joined a few of the clubs related to his major, which he's really enjoying so far. If you have Instagram, follow all the specific pages for AU. I am amazed at all the activities and clubs Auburn has. It blows my little PA state school out of the water!\n\nI remember feeling lost at sea as a freshman. It takes a while to get your groove, but you will!",

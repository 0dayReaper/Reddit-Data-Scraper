I have a really close friend that is a yoga instructor and they have been pressuring me into giving it a try ,but they live far away so I am not able to attend their classes. I am looking for options in the Auburn/Opelika area. Any and all information would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

A beginner series will give you lots of instruction, along with ways to modify the poses if you aren't flexible for the full version. We both like Yoga with Kassandra. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@yogawithkassandra/playlists",

I am a first timer to yoga and feel comfortable with the instructor there-she does not push me to do anything my body can not do:). That may not be the environment you are looking for but could be worth checking out.",

But after taking a few classes as part of my membership, I am hooked. I am a treadmill, bike, tan type of gymer :) For my type of workout I am just as satisfied at Crunch as I was at PF. But when I decided to take the Hatha Flow class and really found it rewarding-for that 1 hour I am in another world and my body gets a workout without me realizing it. Crunch definitely has more stuff to me.\n\nCrunch is super busy at certain hours but they have hours where you can get a really good workout on any machine you may need. They have pretty good hours overall being open 24/5. They offer free trails all the time for full access-it is a good way to see the gym in every area. They have a sauna, tanning beds, spray tan access, hydro massage, all equipment and classes as part of their full package. For the price I feel like I get a really good deal.",

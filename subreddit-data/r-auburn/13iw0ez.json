    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman studying architecture. Today I was taken off of the housing waitlist and assigned to Harper Hall in the Upper Quad. Honestly, I'm very happy. It has a good location, it's renovated, and I believe it's the best looking. However, with that being said, my idealized version of reality is not 100% accurate. So, if anyone here lives/has lived in the Upper Quad and/or Harper Hall, can you please enlighten me on your experience? Thank you very much.",

            "comment": "I lived in Broun around 15 years ago. While I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve been upgraded since then, I bet the overall experience is still the same.\n\nThe rooms are pretty basic. Two twin beds to a room.  Back then, each person had their own desk, closet, and dresser. Two rooms share a bathroom.  There is a common kitchen, and some of the upper quad halls have a basement study room.\n\nI honestly LOVED that year.  Living in the upper quad was truly a fabulous way to meet some wonderful people.  I ended up spending my first college spring break in the NC mountains with people I met in Broun. My best friend to this day was one of my suitemates and I\u2019m the godmother to her daughter. Take advantage of the quad study room and cook with your neighbors. They used to show movies in the lobby\u2026I bet they still do.\n\nI honestly think the old-school style dorms make for a much better, more memorable college experience. They force you to be social in a new place. Do it for a year, make a bunch of friends, then move on to an apartment. There\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll get placed with a weirdo or a slob, but hey, that\u2019s part of the experience. The rooms are nothing special, but the location can not be beat.  You\u2019re right in the heart of campus, which makes it easier to get your bearings as a freshman.  Enjoy!",

The Hill was pretty much the same except for location. Living in the dorm isn\u2019t luxurious like an apartment and will be frustrating at times, but if I had the chance to do it all over again I would. My advice is to keep up with the cleaning since the buildings are old and make it as cozy as possible! \n\nLike mentioned above, make the most of it and spend time with the people you genuinely connect with. It might feel foreign at first but it gets better. Enjoy every second of being an Auburn student!",

Very easy to get to every class on foot, easy to get to on campus restaurants and also the library as well. It\u2019s overall convenient and a decent space I\u2019d say. Only thing I could criticize is that the fire alarm went off from people trying to cook in the communal kitchen, and often at a very late time as well. The quad is also a good way to get opportunities to meet a lot of people with the events and such that often went on. RAs in my experience were very nice and relatively lenient, and I was on good terms with mine for a while even after I\u2019d moved out.",

            "comment": "Haha another arch student, I lived in Harper hall my sophomore year 2018-19. When I was there it was designated as one of the halls that would also have upperclassmen. I imagine that's still the same so might not be as chaotic as one of the freshmen dorms elsewhere on campus.\n\nI will say that year when I was also studying architecture I had classes in Biggin, diagonal from Toomers, Lowder, near mama G's, and obviously Dudley, the architecture building. The location in the quad was great for all of those just because I could swing by and grab anything between classes. You'll also be close to J&amp;M where you'll be getting all your supplies for studio from. \n\nFor food you're close to the student center which has a lot of options and not far from the new culinary science building which I believe has a food hall you can use dining dollars at (don't quote me on that it opened after I graduated). There's also a Panera in the library just across the concourse from Harper and they open early and close late. \n\nAll that being said if you stick with architecture most of you time will be spent in Dudley and visiting the cafe next to B6 for snacks lol. Anyways, good luck with architecture first year is pretty tough, I did summer op so can't comment on how stressful foundations is.  Have a great freshman year! WDE!",

Was it any particular classes you took? Was it simply adjusting to college life? Or was it a confluence of factors? I don't think my freshman year will be a breeze but some of the 5th years on the tour told me that the summer program gave them time for Greek life, intermural sports, football games, etc. So I was under the impression I'd live like a business major for a year.",

I did summer op for the same reasons you said and I had a great first year, joined a fraternity, went to all the home games, and generally had a lot of free time and made good grades. Summer op is a different beast though, prepare to be waking up before the sun rises and leaving studio when they kick you out at midnight lol.",

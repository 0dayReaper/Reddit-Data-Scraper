Basically, if I were you, I'd ask the housing office what your place is on the list, and also if there is a realistic chance you'll be taken off of it. When I found out I was #15 the stress went away. Also, it is worth mentioning that your place on the waitlist is determined by how early you applied. I applied in early February, I don't know when you applied but chances are you did it too late. Regardless, work on collecting information about your predicament. That's what I did and it worked for me.",

It's easy to find a sublease even though off campus may not be your first pick.  Some apartments are very close to campus and it won't cost anything to get on their waitlist.",

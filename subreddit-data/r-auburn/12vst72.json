The Brookes has really well priced 1b/1br condos, 2 pools, pet friendly \u2014 based on no other info, maybe check them out. They are down wire rd by the vet school so it is a bit of a drive into downtown",

Last I saw, 1BR were going for around $750/month but rental markets been pretty crazy lately. Savannah Square is closer to $900 I think but in the same area\n\nhttps://www.rent.com/alabama/auburn-apartments/brookes-condos-4-lnp001E0000011c9KZIAY\n\nAlso, just happened to come across this place while looking for the Brookes. Looks like efficiency apartment downtown $675/month? No pets but I\u2019ll link if you wanna check it out\n\nhttps://www.apartments.com/1-br-1-bath-house-634-w-magnolia-312-auburn-al/rde6tm1/",

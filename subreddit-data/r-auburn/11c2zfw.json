Being at a level where you get a university level scholarship should mean you are at least competitive for a departmental/AUSOM one though\nETA that I was in the same boat as a freshman....might help to know what department you are in as that will determine what sorts of scholarships are available",

            "comment": "Hey, this is a little bit late and you may have already heard this, but according to the Financial Office, all scholarships have been released at this point. I know from others that go to Auburn that departmental scholarships are more likely once you're a sophomore+, because then you're actually established in said department. That being said, don't discount local/national scholarships! Many aren't due till April so you have plenty of time to research. What is your major? A lot of local/national scholarships are major-related. Have leadership skills/experience? That's a good look to most local/national scholarships. Are you from Alabama? There is a good chance that your county has an Auburn Club that offers a scholarship to a high school student from your county.",

As long as they give you free reign over what you use it for (books and room instead of tuition only) they would be good to look at, at this point, and will be awarded well into the summertime most likely.",

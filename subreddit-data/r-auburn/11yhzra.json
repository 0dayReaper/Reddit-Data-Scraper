    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI am helping my son sign up for freshman housing.  He is hoping to get into the Engineering RLP at Aubie hall.  It is my understanding that Aubie is a co-ed dorm.  I assume this means that each floor is separated by gender?\n\nHow are the floors laid out?  Every other floor by gender?  If so, I assume girls get the first floor?\n\nHow are the room numbers laid out?  Do the numbers increase as you move away from the front desk?\n\nAnd, just a silly question...anyone have a recommendation for \"best room\" on Aubie Hall?",

I can\u2019t remember how the numbers were laid out, but I found a building map somewhere online when I was signing up for my room. I don\u2019t know that there is a \u201cbest room,\u201d you really just want to be near the stairs or near the elevator",

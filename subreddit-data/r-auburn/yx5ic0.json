They provide shelter, of course, but from what I researched, they are really trying to sort of infiltrate Aubrun's sort of negligence toward those who just need help. \n\nI believe they do transitional housing, food drives, support for victimized women, and addiction recovery. I was on the very cusp of needing a system like this and they were pretty much the only place in all of Lee County that I could find that seemed to be really devoted in trying to create a real and true support system.",

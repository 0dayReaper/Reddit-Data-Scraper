Per university policy, \u201cOnce submitted, a final grade may be changed only by the request of the instructor, with the approval of the department head and dean, by means of a workflow submitted to the Office of the Registrar.\u201d For what it\u2019s worth, I submitted one last Friday and it was completely processed by Saturday morning.",

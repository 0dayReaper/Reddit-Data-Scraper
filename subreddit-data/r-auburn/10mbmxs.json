    "postText": "Hi all! This might be a weird post, but I figured this sub would be the best place to ask.\n\nI'm not from Alabama, much less from the US, although I've visited Texas a few times. Never been to AL, although I'd definitely love to. I'm from Costa Rica.\n\nSome 10-12 years ago, some visitors from a church trip came from the US and I befriended one of them. They gave me a shirt, it's a simple gray shirt, and it has the legend \"Big Blue Bookstore, Auburn, AL\" in the front, and \"Home of Shug, the Wonderdog\" in the back, alongside a monochromatic pic of a cute looking dog. Once very oversized for me, that shirt has become one of my \"stay at home\" shirts since it now fits me well.\n\nEvery now and then, when I wear it, I get curious about the backstory of it. By some Google searches, I've been able to find out that Big Blue was a bookstore in your city, that might have closed a while ago, and that Shug was (or is?) a dog that frequented the place, or might even have belonged to the owners or some such.\n\nI mainly wanted to ask for info about the topic. Is the bookstore really closed? And particularly about Shug: does he/she still live? Are there any pics? Is the dog from the \"A dog named Shug\" books the same as the dog from the bookstore?\n\nThanks for the help on this weird question of mine, I've been curious about this for years now.",

            "comment": "The Dog Named Shug books aren\u2019t the same dog. That\u2019s from a book series where the name of the dog and college is changed, and everything else stays the same. For example, there\u2019s a Dog Named Munson book for the University Georgia; exact same art and words, but different name for the dog and university. Iirc books were made for each college in the SEC. \u201cShug,\u201d as a name in Auburn, refers to Shug Jordan. He was a multi sport athlete and later became a coach. Our football stadium is named Shug Jordan Stadium after him, and it\u2019s a pretty common name to give to pets among Auburn fans. The bookstore is closed now. The dog used to wander around the store and belonged to the owner or store manager, and had a bed behind the counter. There\u2019s no way to know if the dog is still alive; it wasn\u2019t really a local celebrity or anything like the shirt made it seem. Even people who shopped at the store might not have known the dog\u2019s name.  Making shirts with quirky things on them that not everyone would \u2018get\u2019 used to be a bit of a tradition here. Source: I\u2019m old and have lived here all my life, and I\u2019m a librarian.",

It would just kinda wander in and out, it would go out front on the sidewalk sometimes, very chill. I never knew its name but Shug is a pretty standard name for a dog in Auburn.",

It\u2019s a wonderful place with tons of tradition and lore worth sinking your teeth into. However, Shug the dog is unfamiliar to me. The bookstore is closed but there are still some really cool things to check out. Come grab a lemonade and get you a new shirt.",

            "comment": "I remember Shug the dog! He belonged to one of the owners of Big Blue Bookstore. He was a very cute red Golden Retriever. This was back around 2010-12. The dogs owner split off from Big Blue Bookstore because he and the other owner got in a disagreement about renting text books? I can\u2019t remember exactly but he went off and opened another bookstore called Shug\u2019s College Bookstore. The dog Shug would hang out at this store. Both bookstores are now closed. [here\u2019s a link to a Google image I found of Shug the dog](https://images.app.goo.gl/2wB1ByLy63mDqnzU8)",

Have taken several of my dogs to Auburn vet clinic and mentioned this while I\u2019m there. \n\nBeing 45 minutes or more away from a vet is a death sentence for a true emergency. Even when we had an emergency vet in Columbus, and one of my dogs had an accident, I took her on a 15 minute drive and she died in the vehicle on the trip.",

            "comment": "Opening a standard veterinary clinic is extremely expensive. Most clinics are not owned by the veterinarians who practice there, but are owned by private equity: VCA, VetCor, Pathway, PetVet, Wellhaven, etc. Opening a 24-hour or even after hours emergency clinic is even more expensive. \n\nAs someone who lived in Columbus from 2017-2022 and used Auburn\u2019s veterinary hospital last year for emergency services, I wish it was realistic to have one, but it\u2019s unfortunately not. To be honest, our independent vet was acquired by another vet in town that then built a new facility after being bought by private equity. The prices blew up, compensation went down, and quality of care decreased.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, I 23M just moved to Auburn a few months ago from Houston to be closer to my girlfriend. The issue is it's proven really hard to meet new friends as a lot of people my age are still in school here and most social spaces are student only outside of bars. I was lucky enough to develop a pretty successful career without college and while my girlfriend has tried to get me to connect with her friends boyfriends, we just have nothing in common. How would you recommend making friends when you aren't a student?",

Try out Uniq Coffee, Coffee Cat, Coffee Mafia, Ross House Coffee, or Ristretto in Opelika! Also Opelika is filled with a lot of cool hanging spots and events with less of a student crowd. i would definitely go check out historic downtown Opelika areas and see if there\u2019s anything that interests you around there. Might meet some cool people that way. Good luck!",

Then it gets a little bit easier to find small groups to hang out with.",

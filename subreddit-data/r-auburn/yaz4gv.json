Currently at the Union with some other people but hoping to find a place to stay with my friends.\nHere are some preferences:\n- Have TigerTransit pass by\n- Have 3-4 private bedrooms &amp; bathrooms if possible\n\nI\u2019m new to the place, but I\u2019ve heard that Logan Square and EagleWest are good? Please leave me any suggestions since I have no idea about any other places, thank you!",

You\u2019ll also want to avoid The Beacon like a plague, way too many things get covered up there. I know The Mill on S College is pretty good and Yugo North isn\u2019t horrible but maintenance can be slow on some things. \n\nEagles West is good too but they fill up faster than any others. Start doing some tours of your top three picks then see if you can talk to any residents there to actually hear the full truth about the place. But best of luck in your search my friend!",

My apartment complex for example sends out lease renewals in September (lease is august-July) and is usually filled up again with new tenants coming in by the end of October. I also live very close to campus and rent is very cheap at my complex so you can\u2019t hold onto units for very long before they get refilled.",

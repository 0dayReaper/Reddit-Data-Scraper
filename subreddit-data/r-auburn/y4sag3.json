    "postText": " This semester I'm taking a class that is a prerequisite for a class I intend to take at Auburn next Spring. However, since Auburn's system won't be aware that I took and passed this class until I transfer the credits, I am wondering if it will allow me to register for this class once the registration window opens in a few weeks (traditionally, if you haven't passed or aren't taking the prerequisite at the time you're trying to register, it won't allow you to register for a particular class). \n\nMy worry is that if I wait until mid-December there will be no spots left. \n\nI was wondering if anyone has been in this position before.\n\nThank you!",

Just make sure you get your official transcript sent to Auburn as soon as you can once the grade posts so you won't be dropped from that class when the next semester begins. \n- Says an AU academic advisor who deals with this on a regular basis. :)",

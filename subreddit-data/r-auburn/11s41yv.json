In HS the FFA(Future Farmers of America) had a organization wide string band competition, might also be worth checking with an Ag department if they have any student groups pickin\u2019. \n\nCould also try old school flyers posted around campus. Craigslist and Facebook groups. \n\nI\u2019m confident there\u2019s someone in the area that\u2019ll want to play, finding them will be the hardest part",

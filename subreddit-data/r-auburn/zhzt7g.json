That relationship has ended and quickly the realization that the only friends In Auburn I made were through her.\nI have never been super social, but trying to do better and get out of my comfort zone. I love sports or anything outdoors. I work Remotely, while finishing classes online and my interaction with others is now even more limited than before. \nIf anyone has anything they could suggest to get out more it would be helpful.",

All great suggestions on here, but as a fellow not-super-naturally-social person who needs human interaction like anyone else lol it\u2019s all about what makes it worth getting out of your comfort zone.\n\nThere are lots of friendly outgoing people around here. People will strike up conversations with you at bars, Little Italy\u2019s/Moe\u2019s; coffee shops if you become somewhat familiar face (work or do online classes there).\n\nGo on Meetup if you want to check out a hiking group or you\u2019re into board games/DND, etc\n\nIf you\u2019re into spiritual stuff, I\u2019ve heard lots of welcoming Christian groups (of course lol you\u2019re in the south). There\u2019s a sorta Buddhist/meditation group that meets weekly and has tea. I\u2019m sure lots of others I\u2019m not aware of\n\nLong story short, Auburn is actually very diverse and has lots of popular, obvious things, as well as niche groups.

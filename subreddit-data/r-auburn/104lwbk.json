            "comment": "The AMC Tiger 13 in Opelika is the best in the area, although it\u2019s not quite as good as Premiere. It opened in 2014 and features 13 theaters including a BigD, a large and beautiful atrium/lobby area, concessions, and a convenient 2-sided popcorn refill station and 8 coke freestyle machines. It\u2019s located in Capp\u2019s Landing adjacent to Tiger Town. The AMC Auburn 14 by the mall is similar but inferior due to age, having opened in 1998. The theaters are smaller and less up-to-date. There is, however, a BigD as well as an arcade. I\u2019m not sure if the arcade is still open as it has appeared to be closed the past few times I\u2019ve been, but from what I remember it was pretty lackluster; just a few old machines against a wall. Both are similar, but Opelika\u2019s has the edge technologically and aesthetically, and I always have a more enjoyable time there. Distance and location aren\u2019t an issue, as the Tiger Town area is basically Auburn, being right off the interstate.",

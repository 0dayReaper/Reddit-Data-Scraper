The tour starts in front of Biggin Hall at 8 pm. They also do a shorter tour around Opelika at 6 pm. My wife and I went last Friday and were pleasantly surprised at how good it was. It's crazy that it's free, it was on par, if not better, than ghost tours we've done in New Orleans or Savannah. We tipped them well. \n\nAlso, the [Auburn Heritage Association ](http://www.auburnheritageassoc.org/index.html) does interactive, well acted, lantern ghost tours of Pine Hill Cemetery every other year... I think this year they're doing it in Opelika \n\nScroll [here](https://www.aotourism.com/Calendar/) to see other events, along with those listed.",

            "comment": "1 local spirit is Sydney. He originally haunted the small old church across the street from campus cause it used to be a hospital during the Civil War. He would play tricks on the theater department back when they put on shows there. When they moved to their present location, they invited him along &amp; he actually followed! Now, they always leave candy out for him before performances so he doesn't mess around with props/lights/stuff in the middle of shows.\n\nI know the local tours will tell the story better, but that's the gist of it \ud83d\ude01",

They have the most equipment, the best bang for your buck, but they do not stay open late enough imo. \n\nMax was ok for awhile but they started removing weights and machines to add more space for class stuff. So there is like one corner with weights and the rest is treadmills. \n\nTiger iron was ok also I haven\u2019t been since they expanded. \n\nMoved across town so I\u2019m closest to crunch and it\u2019s been my favorite so far. It\u2019s just so big I never feel like I have to wait on a rack.",

They have resistance machines I have never seen at other gyms, and they have childcare so fun that my toddler begs to go to the gym.  I'd recommend keeping earplugs or earbuds on hand in case a PUSH class is going on, but that is really the only downside.  I joined when it was pay a flat $299 for two years of access with no additional fees or sneaky contracts impossible to escape from.",

I put on my initial application that I wanted to be in Civil, but I think Aero is better for me and it\u2019s something I\u2019m genuinely passionate about. I was accepted to the college, but I don\u2019t see anywhere where I was accepted into a specific course of study. Is this something I declare later like the FYE program at Purdue?",

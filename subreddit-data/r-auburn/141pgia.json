    "postText": "Hi guys! Has anyone else had an issue with a Red Elantra that has an intricate gold logo on the driver side door as well as the passenger door lurking around your home/on your street? About once a week this car appears in my cul de sac (not in a neighborhood) and idles- sometimes with flashers, sometimes without- with two people inside sometimes for hours, and always at different times of day. I can't make the logo out. It is beginning to freak me out, as this has been going on for months now. Today, I was blocked in my driveway because of their parking, and they slightly moved for me to get out, but it took a while for them to do so. I considered asking what the deal was, but, alas, people are crazy and I was alone. Anyone else have this or have any insights to what this could be?",

If they were casing the place to rob it they wouldn't be out there for months.\n\nAlso they probably aren't having sex for two hours?\n\nIf it's a culdesac not in a neighbor hood it's probably smoking like everyone said.",

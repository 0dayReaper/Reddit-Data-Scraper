Hell I have a friend whose wife was asked by Dan Mullen to fuck a play so they would come there. It happens everywhere it doesn\u2019t make it right but Jesus Christ if you\u2019re ok with everyone else doing it don\u2019t hate a guy who actually got caught and has been paying for it\u2026 and don\u2019t even come play me with the sexual harassment or the briarcliff thing there was nothing there for the sexual harassment allegations if there was he would have a charge and the school thing there was zero evidence beside heresay.

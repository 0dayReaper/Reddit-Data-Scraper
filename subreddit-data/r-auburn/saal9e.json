Way more dangerous than 25 people in a classroom. But the basketball game isn't required. At this point, we all know what covid is and we know what we're personally comfortable with in regards to risks. You know that going to a basketball game is risky, but it's your choice if you want to go or not. You assume those risks of your own free will.  With class, you don't really get the option of deciding it's too risky and staying home. The compromise, then, is to try and make the classroom as safe as possible for everyone. Hence, the masks.",

There\u2019s comes a point where it just can\u2019t and won\u2019t be enforced in an atmosphere like basketball games, which is why I\u2019m thankful for the masks in the classroom so that those who went and possibly caught it but don\u2019t know it yet are less likely to spread it to others.",

Your question is a bit like saying, \"Why is it that you paid $100 for groceries earlier this month, but today $10 is too much for a banana?\" \n\nJust because you take some risks doesn't mean other risky things aren't risky anymore, ya know? Every risk increases your chances of getting it and spreading it, regardless of what you did the day before. \n\nThat said, your question was aimed more at the university's reasoning, and my answer is more helpful for understanding the choices individuals make. But hopefully still relevant. \n\nChoosing to mask sometimes is only as hypocritical as wearing your seatbelt sometimes. Saying someone shouldn't mask in one situation because they didn't in another is like saying a seatbelt won't protect you because you didn't wear one last time.",

Which if I don\u2019t leave, what?  \n\nSo when it comes down to teachers mandating masks, you do not have the right to threaten absence or fail students for not having your \u2018health standards\u2019 or projecting your insecurities (that\u2019s literally why you get annual sick leave, to be sick bc it\u2019s expected\u2026).  That is just patently insane.\n\nYou also have no authority to impose your \u2018health standards\u2019 on my ability to obtain the education paid for.  Lose some weight or something, decrease your odds of risk, cause that is only a risk for yourself and an average cold to those around you.\n\nThe university just goes by this collective soul, pseudoscientific stance with no data and no critical evaluation, mostly cause they don\u2019t WANT to have one bc that would mean defying their true constituents. They have even been letting employees go for not getting the vaccine.  It\u2019s only a little threat to ruin your livelihood and future.",

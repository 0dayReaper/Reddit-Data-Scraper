If you want a full evaluation with written report (which Auburn requires for testing accommodations), I\u2019m not sure if they do it or not. I\u2019d assume they would since it\u2019s through the school, but outside practices in Auburn/Opelika accepting new clients now are Psychological Assessment Center and Clinical Psychologists PC. Definitely look for licensed psychologist, psychiatrists here have waitlists for 6-13 months \n\nSource: I do Behavioral Health coding for the area",

One other one to potentially check out is AUPSC \u2014 it\u2019s the training clinic for Auburn\u2019s grad students who are becoming clinical psychologists and by far the cheapest. They are overseen by a PhD and do evaluations but idk if they do the reports for accommodations. They definitely do therapy too though, I think $30-$60/session https://www.cla.auburn.edu/psychology/aupsc/",

It is a survey based test that allows GPs to assess and diagnose anxiety. \n\nIf you think you need to see someone to treat anxiety through therapy, then definitely ask your GP for a recommendation to a therapist. Psychologists are therapists that listen and help resolve issues. \n\nPsychiatrists are the ones that listen but have an in-depth knowledge of psychiatric medication that\nWill assist on one's mental health journey. \n\nI'm proud of you that you are taking serious steps towards your mental health. You would be very surprised to know how many people have some form of mental health disorder, and it is absolutely nothing to feel abnormal about.",

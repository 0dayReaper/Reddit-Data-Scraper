It\u2019s convenient, but I like the other school as well, and Auburn just accepted me. Everyone was secretly hoping I would go here, but I only know there vet and psychology program is really good. And the football games of course. I\u2019m supposed to take a tour soon. I want to really consider Auburn though. What is everyone\u2019s experience?",

I think freshman year is *pivotal*, and the friends I made that year carried with me more than every other year of college. I\u2019d sooner live at home every *other* year than freshman year.\n\nHonestly pretty shocked everyone is giving you the opposite advice. \n\nThere\u2019s something about that first year out of high school that\u2019s great to get out of home. I think it\u2019s important psychologically as well as socially. You\u2019re coming into your own, you\u2019re joining clubs, (personally I went down the list of university clubs/organizations and thought about each! Joined the sailing club and several others freshman year, and I loved every minute of them. Highly recommend doing this.), you\u2019re getting to know newbies too. \n\nPersonally, those dollars would be one of the last I\u2019d regret spending.\n\nMy two cents.",

Otherwise, why bother, just go to community college for 2 years first, you won\u2019t be plugged in there anyway. \n\n4k$ for that year of living in the dorms is a drop in the bucket for college loans of $50k+. I think everyone commenting is just bitter from loans and isn\u2019t thinking critically here.\n\nI\u2019m commenting bc I genuinely care about you and your college experience!

It did save money, but I think it made things harder for her later on, moving out and experiencing life on her own, away from home. Even minor things like laundry, paying bills and grocery shopping was a bit of a culture shock for her at first. Also the sudden freedom she had was jarring.\n\nI think whatever decisions you make, having an open conversation with your folks (LOL, now I really sound like someones Mom here) about finances, expectations (yours and theirs), etc. is only going to be beneficial to you. \n\nYou may or may not wish to 'go greek', you may or may not wish to joins clubs, and either one of those, outside of the normal going to class,  the library and managing your study hours will take up a lot of your time.  Knowing what both of y'alls expectations of your college life might be, right from the start, might help you form a better opinion of which school to attend.\n\nOf course I am *always* going to say 'pick Auburn' over other choices, but ultimately it's the things you want to gain from your university experiences, both educationally and socially, that is the most important.\n\nWishing you much luck in all of your endeavors.",

If you got into Auburn, you are likely to get huge scholarships at Southern Union. Again, this is about having to take out loans. If you are, definitely consider this option bc it will help you tremendously in the long run.",

Freshman year is the year I made the majority of my friends in college, and most of those lived in my dorm. Also, being able to do what I wanted, when I wanted, and not having to worry about what my parents thought, or worry about them questioning me when I came home late, was worth every penny I paid for student housing. It allowed for a lot of growth on my part. \nTo me the ideal way to do it would be to get a dorm your freshman year, and then sophomore year get an apartment with friends you made freshman year. That way you have time for growth for yourself and your parents, and then if you want to live with them junior and afterwards, you have allowed there to be time for them to see you more as an adult and not their little one that needs their constant supervision. \nMaybe that last part is just my childhood coming out, but I think most people can relate to that to some degree.",

While it is true that making friends ur 1st year is probably the best for u, i now have plenty of friends. I'm in my 2nd year, but i took a lot of core classes during hs/summer, so i'm mainly taking my major courses. U see a lot of the same ppl throughout ur major classes, so ur bound to make friends either way. It also helps to take the step and go up to someone. That's how i have the college friends i have rn. I'd say really think abt whether not having student loans or having a social life is more important to u.",

Most of my friends are my roommates, and since you won\u2019t have that you\u2019re gonna have to put yourself out there in other ways. Not sure how strict your parents are and I\u2019m not sure what you really want out of the college experience, but I wouldn\u2019t wanna live w my parents in college personally because they would be watching what I do all the time which I think it\u2019s a negative in college. They are right financially, but if you could stay on campus just one year I think it would help a lot. War eagle good luck!",

You probably will have to push yourself a little in the beginning to get involved, but once you get the ball rolling, it\u2019s totally possible to have the full college experience while living at home. I didn\u2019t see if you mentioned the other college you were looking at, but I\u2019d just say keep an open mind about it all!

But if it's for a job or school at AU, the applications and forms are all online and the process is step-by-step and prompts you for everything. I don't think you need references for school, but I was a transfer the first time and a second degree student the second time.\n\nIf you're applying for a job and can't find it, call AU HR for assistance.",

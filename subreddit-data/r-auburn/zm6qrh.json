At the end of the day it essentially means nothing except you get a 1-on-1 tour of Auburn and I think attend a luncheon with the other VITs on tour that day, additionally I think you get to meet early with advisors. So while it's useful and I encourage going, by the time you admit as a student it won't mean anything.",

Also gives you a chance to meet with honors college rep and a dean in the course if study you are interested in - and you get a really cool tshirt. Both my boys got the VIT tour.  One is a senior other a freshman - never paid any tuition and they LOVE Auburn.",

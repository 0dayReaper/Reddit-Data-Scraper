The owner is the toughest I\u2019ve ever worked for, but was also very fair and also got in the trenches with us. She was never afraid to bus a table, mop up a spill, or to clean a bathroom. However, LOTS of students that came to work there were poor little rich kids that basically only did so for beer money. They often called out, quit after a few days or weeks, and couldn\u2019t hang with the work ethic the staff expects of you. That\u2019s why they always have such a giant staff. They operate it with a group email where servers send a message to get a shift covered. There were messages every day from kids who didn\u2019t want to work. I\u2019m not sure how it\u2019s run now, but when I worked there it was hard work, but you could make incredible money if you had a good work ethic, especially at the Lake.",

We love it and it has a really fun selection of different animal parts- usually toward the back of the store in the freezer section near the live fish counter.",

No one here actually butchers their own animals.",

Also try Piggly Wiggly in Opelika(they have a huge meat selection-maybe find something there not in Kroger or Publix). Also the Market at Ag Heritage Park, it opens May, we found rabbit. The people had a farm near here and may show up at other outdoor markets held local.",

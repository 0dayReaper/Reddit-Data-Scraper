    "postText": "Hi all, I'm a junior this year and trying to decide between two classes for next semester. I am either going to take BIOL 4100 (Cell Biology) or BIOL 5600 (Mammalian Physiology \\[Biomedical Physiology\\]). I'm really searching for a class that will best prepare me for the Biology section of the MCAT (especially since anatomy isn't a required class for pre-meds). TIA!!",

Cell bio with Dr. Siebenhener was good prep for 1st semester of med school however, even though most of the pathways were in way more depth than required for med school. I would recommend online histology as well for medical school.",

To me it seems pretty standard practice, so the guy shouldn't play.\n\nThe real lesson is this: as long as universities fetishize violent contact sports, they will need to deal with the violent men who manage and play them. It's a trade off\n\nI say let them get endorsements, pay them out the ass, but make them play with no safety gear. Give the crowds what we really want to see.

All in the wrong, but Hunter seems to be both the perpetrator of nonconsensual distribution and the victim of revenge porn being posted to the much wider platform of Twitter.\n\nGood on Auburn for being proactive, but let\u2019s hope the truth comes through on this one and Hunter isn\u2019t immediately demonized with a ruined career like what happened with Araiza (only for the exonerating details to be quietly announced after the damage was done).",

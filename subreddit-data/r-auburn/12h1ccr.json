Since your an upcoming senior, it\u2019s much much much more important to formulate a killer AUSOM application because that\u2019s where the bulk of most peoples money comes from. Most applicants only get $1,000 or so from it but if you create a really really good application you\u2019ll definitely put yourself in a position to win a lot of money. I actually chatted with the Director of Scholarships from the Engineering Department, and she told me some of the things that made my app stand out. Feel free to Pm me if you wanna chat more",

Unless you just know you wanna be an engineer etc. then I would wait for the 4 year.",

Work through the ACT work book and maybe hire an ACT tutor. They will help you a lot. Then also just focus on volunteering and extracurriculars and working on good essays and you will be able to get accepted and get good scholarships most places. There are more scholarships too besides official ones as well as long as you are proactive you can get money and do things like school work programs:) hope this helps!",

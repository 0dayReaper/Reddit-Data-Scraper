I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re a student or not but I think the young crowd would go for it. \n\nRaves seem to feel like a part of the past but maybe that\u2019s because I went when I was younger and lost interest? \n\nI think the best part of the rave is being out in the woods, tripping/rolling and feeling great, and not being in a typical bar or club setting. I think this area might tend to go for more country type of vibes, but if you think about it, what\u2019s more country than partying in the woods? I would definitely choose mushrooms over Molly ;) lol.",

    "postText": "Hey y'all, I'm in the middle of some conflict with close friends (been lasting a week so far). 4 days into it when a friend got perhaps the most hurt they'd been yet....we also drove for the first time that week. With no issues before, suddenly the car was shaking/lurching/idling/stalling when going slow. \n\nWe got a check engine light, took it to the dealership, and got this picture after it was noted as \"rodent damage.\" The person we talked to on the phone immediately was like \"this doesnt look like rodent damage to me...\" Our neighbors suggested the wire could've just snapped in an even way. It also could be a random Ford employee. It also could be our friends. \n\nWe don't want to accuse anyone or rule anything out too early, and are trying to get evidence on if anyone has had shady interactions with this dealership? It can help us understand if this is part of a pattern. \n\nWe are looking for concrete evidence where we can, but in the meantime....I appreciate you reading this and responding if you have any insight!",

For example me and my gf bought a Toyota Rav 4 in 2020 and we had like 2 years of \u201cFREE\u201d oil changes and inspections. We had been getting them for the first year at the dealership we bought from (tuscaloosa) but one time i decided to schedule one at a dealership closer to home (Mississippi). I get my oil changed, tires rotated and as im in the lobby one of the other customers there for a grinding noise in their tire gets approached by worker holding a tiny rock supposedly from there wheel or something. I leave after my appointment and now my right wheel is grinding on the way home. So i go back the next day and tell them what i hear and as im sitting in the lobby the worker comes out with, you guessed it, a tiny rock that was supposedly in my wheel. This has never happened before and hasnt happened again. They charged me like $85 for that after my free oil change and inspection.",

            "comment": "The compression of the wires (oval appearance) indicates the use of wire cutters or plyers. Rodent damage isn't precise. They didn't want to kill you just fuck your life up a little. \n\nWhich circuit was cut? \n\nThat's a beefy wire for a sensor, but it is important enough to cause you problems. Did they just connect the wires back together, or was a part removed? \n\nNo way it's the dealership because you brought it there. They are a cash sucking vacuum, but absent your story, that's really the only likley explanation.\n\nMake sure your friend knows that it'll cost thousands and that your car caught fire and a pregnant woman was burnt trying to help you.",

Theres three of them, so eithere @cylinders, but the code had to do with ignition coils",

    "postText": "Hi I\u2019m visiting Alabama for work and figured I should drive up to Auburn from Mobile for the game. I was wondering if you could help me figure out where to park or where to buy a parking permit as I am not finding a lot of great information on the web and the guy I work with who lives in Auburn says he hates football and wouldn\u2019t know (strange) any help would be greatly appreciated. Also if anyone knows what side of the field is in the shade my burgeoning melanomas would thank you",

Expect to walk a lot. If you sit behind the auburn football sideline that should be the most shaded. If you don\u2019t have a ticket, good luck, because it\u2019s gonna be hard to get one, but there\u2019s probably gonna be people outside the game selling them at very high prices.",

It\u2019ll be cheaper than most everywhere else, a short walk across campus to the stadium, and supporting a local college kid instead of some company scalping parking",

When my sister was at University of Michigan for grad school the front desk laughed at me when I asked them about getting a hotel room let alone using points",

You can always look on local Auburn Facebook marketplaces or just type in Auburn Penn State tickets into the Facebook search engine for marketplace in Alabama. You can also check out StubHub game ticks and a few others. They're going to be expensive and they're probably going to be nosebleed sections just for warning you And if you go, don't expect to find somewhere to stay for the night as it will probably be filled up. Once you get there, your best bet is to hit a local bar or something after the game. Have a few drinks and wait until about 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning before you try to drive out because of the traffic. Thank you in advance for wanting to come though. Auburn is a great city and going to the football games is an awesome experience",

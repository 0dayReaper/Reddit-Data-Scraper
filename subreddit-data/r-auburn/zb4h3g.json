I personally don't care if he wants to use hookers.  Grab all the strange you want.  See how many you can get before you hit Bingo, but using hookers to recruit seems a bridge too far if you give a damn about having some level of respectability or ethics.  Then you've got the shit he pulled at Liberty where he texted a sex assault victim to get her to see the error of her ways (in defense of some Liberty admin dickhead).  The only Liberty personnel that should've been contacting her are their lawyers.  Full stop.  This is like hiring Sarkisian and praying that he won't start drinking on the job again.  It's just dumb.  The dude keeps finding ways to fuck it up.",

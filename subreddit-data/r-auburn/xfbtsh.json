I have a friend running a non-profit animal rescue outside of Dadeville.  It's called Seven13 Farm and Sanctuary, and they rescue critters of all kids, not just dogs and cats.   The volunteer services run the gamut from assisting with animal care to fence repair, and anything in between.\n\nHer FB is [Seven13 Farm](https://www.facebook.com/seventhirteenfarm) and [this is the email](mailto:seven13farm@gmail.com).   \n\nAnyone reading this, that might be interested, please consider volunteering.  Thanks y'all!",

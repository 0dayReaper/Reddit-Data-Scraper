    "postText": "Hello! So I was wondering if anyone knew either if the career advisors on campus would talk with someone who isn't a student (potentially a student) or if anyone knows of a career advisor that isn't a part of the university? I was a high school drop out, and so I missed out on that part of the high school to college transition. I'm 30 now and I've saved and worked really hard to get to a point where I could go to college, but I'm having a hard time figuring out what exact like... Path/classes I should take to initiate the career I would like to have. If anyone has any advice as well I'd be happy to take it. I would like to be a Patient Advocate specifically in lower income medical facilities. Thank y'all for taking the time to read this.",

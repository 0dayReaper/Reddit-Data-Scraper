    "postText": "I am potentially going to attend my first game in Neville Arena this Saturday vs Alabama. I am looking at the standing room only tickets and just had a few questions. \n\n1.) I know there is a bar to put your food and drink, but do you have like an assigned spot there or is it like a first come, first serve situation? If I can\u2019t see the court, it wouldn\u2019t be worth it to me. \n\n2.) How early would you recommend arriving to the arena?",

            "comment": "The spots on the drink rail are not assigned. First come, first serve. \n\nThis Saturday will be especially difficult. Because of College Gameday live at the arena, they are opening arena doors at 9 am for the 1 pm tip. Student overflow goes to the SRO spots. So for this Saturday\u2019s game, if you want to guarantee a spot, you might need to be there four hours early.",

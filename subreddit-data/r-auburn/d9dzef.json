But again I don\u2019t go there a lot because I don\u2019t smoke.  Not to defend anyone but I think the only reason people go smoke there is because that place is technically off-campus. I feel really bad for the residents there, cigarette butts are all over the place and it\u2019s just gross. \nI get where you\u201dre coming from but I still find that meme mildly offensive and not in a funny way.  That sentence translate as \u201c That sign won\u2019t stop me, because I can\u2019t read.\u201d  Being making fun of not able to speak or read English is never fun.

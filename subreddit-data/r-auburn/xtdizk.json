    "postText": "I feel bad for this team. They were doing so well for the first half. It was an amazing half of football then it just stopped. \n\nWhy won\u2019t Hardin take points instead of going for 4 &amp; 11? Why does he keep Carlson in when we have a freshman that kicked 60 yarders last year at his high school. Why can\u2019t they keep any consistency throughout a game? Why does Harsin go for it on 4 &amp; 11?  Why is the answer for that always a long toss up play that almost never works out.\n\nWe hit a wall every game and then nothing. I love this team but it\u2019s hard to watch the same things happening week in and week out. I\u2019m all up for trusting Harsin but we go backwards after a specific point and you can tell when it happens. If we get rid of Harsin, let\u2019s call into question the Board of Directions being a major player in every little thing while we\u2019re at it. Why the hell not? \n\nHarsin, it\u2019s been a fun time and I have been loyal to you throughout the last two years. This is a game we should have won and it\u2019s getting hard to back you if this is what\u2019s being consistently produced. You\u2019ve got to show more emotion going forth. Covering your eyes and bending over so you can\u2019t see isn\u2019t cutting it. Get onto someone, get in their face when they make a dumb decision that affects the entire team. Do it. Just once. You won\u2019t get fired over that.",

Such aggravated and weaponizing language used here that I would be extremely disheartened if this passed. Granted, extremely disheartened they continue passing such polarizing legislation. \n\nHere is the article for anyone not trying to navigate out of Reddit:\n\n\u201cThe bill from Republican state Rep Ernie Yarbrough and several other GOP lawmakers would repeal a provision in state law that exempts abortion patients from prosecution and inserts a so-called \u201cpersonhood\u201d clause that would redefine \u201cperson\u201d to the moment an embryo is fertilised, giving a zygote the same rights as the person carrying it.\n\nProsecutions for abortion \u2013 \u201cregardless\u201d of the viability of the pregnancy \u2013 would \u201cbe treated the same as prosecutions of homicide or assault of a person born alive,\u201d according to the bill, throwing into question whether the state could criminalise miscarriages or other adverse pregancy outcomes.\u201d",

They won't take, any viewpoint to consideration besides their own, because their view points supposedly come from a higher power. \n\nAlso, I never said that starving children and dying people related to this act. I pointed out the fact that they didn't care about them because if they did they would have made legislation on it, before they made this act. \n\nThis correlates directly with their hypocrisy, and should be blatantly easy to see. The fact that they choose to ignore means that they can't be reasoned with and they need to be replaced. Pointed out this fact because I don't understand how they can't, see it, how they can't make that connection. (Even though I do understand how they can, because I understand how the brain works) I said, I didn't, to make dramatic effect, to drive a point home to people who are on the fence. \n\nThis common isn't designed to change anyone who has this viewpoints mind (It can't none of them can). It's for Everyone else that's on the fence, If you're one of those people that has that mindset, then this comment isn't for you.\n\nIf you aren't one of those people, then you should take into consideration that these people are so thoroughly brainwashed that the only thing that they will effectively consider is something that will strengthen their own viewpoint and other things they can use to combat opposing viewpoints.",

There are countless ways this could be wired which was pro fetus but not anti woman. \n\nTo even punish women who may medically need abortions bc of birth defects, terminal illnesses, or other pregnancy complications is, by definition, anti-woman. It's pbrasing also punishes anyone who has a misscarraige. For most women who have misscarrigiages due to fertility issues or other natural (I.e. not drug use), this is directly targeting and punishing them for something they cannot help. \n\n\nThis isn't just a pro life bill. This wording punishes many women for factors beyond their control. If it punished misscarraiges due to drug use, cool. I agree with that. But to blanket charge anyone who has a miscarriage with murder is ridiculous.",

Under this bill, if a woman has a miscarriage due to no fault of her own, perhaps simple fertility issues, she can be charged with murder. \n\nI am all for people who have miscarriages due to negligence such as drug use being charged criminally. But NOT innocent women who have tried to have children for years, and do everything they can to bring a healthy child to life. \n\nIt seems your opinion is pro-life. Which is totally fine. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being pro life. I am kind of in between, since I don\u2019t consider myself someone who should dictate these matters (male.) But I lean pro-choice for younger women who may not have the means to raise a child (altho in a perfect world, they\u2019d j have safe sex.), women who carry babies with terminal defects or other medical issues that could harm the woman, etc. Then i lean pro-life when they try to do things these \u201cabortions up until birth.\u201d But i feel like this bill goes far beyond pro life. The rhetoric in this bill is worded in a way which will hurt innocent women who tried their hardest to birth a child. \n\nWhich, again, is why this bill is not just pro life. It\u2019s anti-woman. Because, the wording in the bill goes far beyond pro life.",

Yarbrough.\n\nThe bill would allow prosecution of murder for those who choose to get an abortion, but Yarbrough said it isn\u2019t likely due to the burden of proof needed.\n\nThis bill would allow duress as a defense in a prosecution for murder, but it would not protect against rape or incest.\n\n\u201cWe would like to see justice brought to the person guilty of the crime of rape or incest, but that two wrongs don\u2019t make a right,\u201d said Rep. Yarbrough, \u201cAnd so we certainly do not want rape or incest to ever, ever happen. But we want to, we want to bring a bill that acknowledges the fact that when that does happen, sadly, we wish that it never did.\u201d\n\nThe bill would also expand the definition of \u201cperson\u201d to begin at the moment of fertilization.",

Even the pro-life *physician* who wrote the anti-abortion law in tennessee later recanted and said he made a mistake after he understood the harms to womens health that his law caused. \n\nLook up the 5 Texas women filing suit. If you care to ban abortion, you have the moral obligation to understand what you\u2019re trying to outlaw.\n\nIf you don\u2019t care to understand, that makes you a real piece of sh\u2014, frankly. Everyone has a duty to understand both sides of an issue, but especially one that affects people\u2019s lives in such a personal way.\n\nObstetricians and gynecologists, *not* abortion doctors, are overwhelmingly against these laws, because they see the risks every day. And Obstetricians love babies and love women, that\u2019s why they chose that career.

Do you believe that if that embryo has a \u201csoul\u201d that souls can be frozen for decades?

Over 1200 women died from pregnancy and childbirth in 2021. 84,000 more nearly died, according to the CDC. \n\nAnd finally, any person with empathy for children would never force a 10 year old child to carry a fetus for 9 months with her tiny undeveloped body and brain.\n\nBut please carry on about \u201cscience\u201d.",

We call that new being a person in this world. There is no magical, arbitrary, unscientific moment of development later when personhood is bequeathed. Just admit it's easier to kill people who are tiny. Maybe you're one of those \"clump of cells\" bots.\n\nLittle in your comment has any scientific bearing on the personhood of the unborn, which is the only question that matters.

Because you can\u2019t bring yourself to say \u201cIVF should be banned due to my religious beliefs, that woman should be forced to carry a fetus that will die, and that 10 year old should be forced to carry and give birth, even if it destroys her ability to conceive in the future\u201d. ALL of these are real situations that will happen in Alabama. \n\nIt\u2019s sad how truly callous you are to many women and girls in these kinds of positions. \n\nIf these are outliers, then there\u2019s no reason not to specifically exempt them, unless you truly give a shit about women. Which you don\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s even more obvious considering how condescending your tone is. \u201cAll you\u2019ve proven is that you don\u2019t know what an abortion is.\u201d Yet you can\u2019t actually say how any circumstance I mentioned is not an abortion. That\u2019s exactly what they are.\n\nIf you actually cared about this issue as deeply as I do, you\u2019d know that there are hundreds of pregnancies in girls aged 10-12 every year in this country. You just care about a non-sentient fetus more than you do about those little girls. What\u2019s absolutely cringe is not caring about all these situations. \n\nWTH is wrong with you that you don\u2019t care about living breathing human beings suffering.\n\nSay whatever you want in response, I\u2019m done, and I can\u2019t wait for the inevitable day that abortion laws like this are abolished forever. Since Gen Z is overwhelmingly pro-choice, it\u2019s just a matter of time. \n\nAnd by the way, I\u2019d limit it to about 10 weeks for elective abortions. Because they start to develop a nervous system, and I actually do care about people\u2019s pain. And aren\u2019t you fortunate you\u2019ll never be in this position. Have the day you deserve, sir.",

Unborn people are very much alive, despite not \"breathing\" like you do.\n\nWhat's sad is how callous you are to the murder of millions of unborn people every year. \"I'd limit it to about 10 weeks,\" congrats on pulling an arbitrary number out of your backside. I'll stick with the science, since a nervous system isn't a sound metric for personhood either you sick freak. \"If they can't feel it, I'm cool with killing them.\" Where do you get off? You're all about science one minute, and a minute later you're literally picking a random number of weeks when magically these people are worthy of not being murdered so you don't have to feel bad about rapists daddy's kid being born?\n\n\"One day, it won't matter because Gen Z is gonna take over!\" Thanks for your speculation, but even if this does happen, it won't make abortion not murder. If the Nazis had taken over the world, it wouldn't have made them right. But I'm sure that idea helps you sleep at night.",

They have the beginnings of a nervous system at that time, and even though scientific consensus is that they don\u2019t feel pain until several weeks later, I think anytime within the first trimester makes sense, because that\u2019s the time period that most miscarriages take place. It\u2019s safely within the time period that pain will not occur.\n\nI do not believe that fetuses just out of the embryo stage have a soul. I don\u2019t think it makes sense to say that the millions of miscarried fetuses were created just to send \u201csouls\u201d to heaven. They cannot feel pain. They do not have sentience. There\u2019s no difference between them and a brain dead human kept alive on life support.\n\nI don\u2019t share your religion. I believe couples should be able to use IVF, that women should be able to abort fetuses who won\u2019t survive at any point, and that little girls shouldn\u2019t be forced to live with the consequences their rapists put on them.\n\nYou\u2019re the \u201csick freak\u201d who cares nothing about people on this earth already. I bet you\u2019re in favor of permissive gun laws, and against social services for mothers and poor kids, too. \n\nAbortion has existed for all of time- Benjamin Franklin published a recipe for it. It\u2019s written about in the Bible. This is just a blip, and your position is already a losing one now. That\u2019s why none of you red states want to put it on the ballot and actually \u201clet the people decide.\u201d\n\nAgain, buh bye.",

Do you understand how morality works? Clearly you didn't understand the Nazi illustration and instead made it about you. The point is, morality is what is is despite what anyone, majority or not, deems. E.g., if the entire world agreed that torturing old people was morally good, it would still be morally WRONG.

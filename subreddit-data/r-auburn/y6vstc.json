    "postText": "Hey everybody I\u2019m a Clemson student coming with my roommate to the Arkansas game since we will be on bye that week. I have been to an auburn game before and remember y\u2019all being nice fans and hoped it was still the same. We both have to rep our team, so was wondering if we will be okay to walk around in a Clemson shirt. Also, are there any restaurants or Auburn-staple type things we need to visit? Thanks",

Good places to grab a bite while downtown are Taco Mama, the hound, acre, live oaks, irritable bao if they\u2019re open and moes bbq. If you want some night life, Sky Bar and Southeastern are the 2 main bars. Moes bbq has a good bar too. If you want a little quiet, try Avondale\u2019s. \n\nStarting there, then head on campus and check out the cursed seal. If you step on it you\u2019ll never graduate (if you\u2019re a student) or if you have graduated, then you\u2019ll be cursed with 7 generations of Bama fans. Next door is samford hall, the clock tower and the giant lave. It was a civil war era cannon lave. \n\nIf you wanna get off campus/ away from downtown, niffers is a local burger place with pickle fries and corn nuggets to die for!! They\u2019d also big mikes steakhouse. Kind upscale, but the owner raises and slaughters his own meat. 10/10 steaks. \n\nIf you\u2019re a hiker, chewachla state park is always beautiful. I love hiking out to the waterfall. On campus there is a nature trail and turtle pond out by the presidents mansion. It\u2019s so pretty and makes great pictures. It\u2019s called the arboretum. I got married there last month! \n\nTiger town is the big shopping mall out in opelika if you need anything. Target, ulta, ect.",

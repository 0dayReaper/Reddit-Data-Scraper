The play calling was non-existent and I got the \u201cthe adults left the room\u201d feeling with half the gimmick shit we were running. There\u2019s no consistency in our offense. \n\nRunning two QBs is just confidence killer. I get if you\u2019re trying to find the right guy, but clearly neither are the right guy. Idk what he did at boise but the caliber of teams he\u2019s against on a week to week basis is not at all the same as when he was out west. \n\nThe offensive line is a god damn joke. It has been for years but Jesus Christ what does it matter who\u2019s in the backfield if the turnstiles are making him run for his life. \n\nOur secondary is just depressing. Absolutely no coverage that is useful. Our front 7 is hit or miss and if it\u2019s against a decent line or RB, it\u2019s a miss. \n\nOur recruiting is average. Whatever. Not gonna touch on that. \n\nIt just seems directionless from top to bottom and I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s any way to recover.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to say we need to be a Bama or Georgia. We are ways away off. But we\u2019re a mizzou loss away from being Vanderbilt.",

But at this rate that\u2019ll be what happens. Might as well let Holden get experience and burn that redshirt now. I love auburn and honestly I was ok with harsin, but the back and forth bullshit reminds me of Gus\u2019s offense that was mediocre at best his last years. Screen pass, up the middle, screen pass, pitch, screen pass, up the middle, screen pass. Just too much shit not enough of a mixup of plays. Derick Hall is a beast and so is leota, but aside from that. Secondary and line is garbage. This team needs change, a plan, a difference in staff. This will be a project.

            "comment": "The OL is desperately needing a overhaul. They are constantly getting beat and no matter who is in the backfield they are running for their life. Running plays can\u2019t get started because Tank hasn\u2019t had big enough holes to run through and absolutely no pass protection for the receivers to run any route. \n\nAs for the backfield, a QB decision needs to be made now. Running two QBs is not working, and although yes it can confuse the defense, much more importantly\u2026it confuses the offense. The timing changes per player and having both causes much more pressure on the offense. \n\nSecondary is abysmal. Absolutely no pressure on jump balls, routes going unchecked and players giving up before the play is even done and terrible angles being chosen (looking at you #10) I think I\u2019ve seen two players look back when the ball is in the air this season, we have tunnel vision on the receivers only and could at least defend some of the passes if they would look back (also would take care of pass interference call)\n\nNow, on to the big problem. Harsin. Do I think that he has been dealt the best hand? Absolutely not, but constantly fighting for your life off the field isn\u2019t helping anything (Board of Directors). His first year he got dealt a terrible hand by a guy that was let go so late (after an extension by an angry AD before he was sacked himself) that he wasn\u2019t going to be a contender for the players we need. This past off season, he was also fighting for his life for some reason or another (even after taking Saban on with a backup QB into 4 OTs). He hasn\u2019t been allowed to recruit the players needed. \n\nDoes that relieve him of some of the play calls throughout his tenure? No. These plays have lacked imagination and will be awful later in the season. We hit a wall every time we get near the end zone (inside the 35) and seem to be trying for the \u2018OMG I can\u2019t believe the incredible play I just witnessed!\u2019 (Fade route with a mediocre QB from the two on the short side of the field)\n\nNow, for a HUGE problem often going unnoticed. What is going on in the Athletic Department? Huge turnover rate at the AD position. We HAVE  to get this figured out. I think maybe the Board is having too much of a power grab and can\u2019t get (and KEEP) great people because they want a quick fix to do their bidding. \n\nTldr: OL and Secondary need a lot of work, QB needs to be decided, play calls lack imagination and Auburn is getting in Auburn\u2019s own way with the current situation going on at the Athletic Department.",

But in the past 5 years or so I don't think I've seen any team get as many pi calls as we have simply from not turning around. It's been a problem since Carlton Davis was a freshman. Also the offensive line hit rock bottom today which is sad considering we had the Clemson game in 2017. This team won't be elite until we start recruiting and developing offensive lineman or build a scheme good enough to compensate for it",

Playing power 5 football you've got to be able to get a push to set up your game and we just can't consistently do that. The defensive line also looked abysmal aside from leota and hall. The defensive back problems that we have are even worse. Aside from 2 plays from dj James we had no pressure on the receivers and they could basically do whatever they wanted. And it's pretty much a given during our games to give up a shit ton of 3rd downs. Execution is just lackluster on both ends and the coaching isn't much better. I gave harsin the benefit of the doubt after losing 5 straight last year but those issues don't seem much better. I'm not hopping on the fire him train yet tho",

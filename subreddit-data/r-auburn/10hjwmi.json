It\u2019s really bad in Auburn, so you might have to drive a little ways.\n\nI found the closest spot with the least light pollution was in Dadeville. And that turned out to be true when I drove out there, it wasn\u2019t awe-inducing but definitely notable and a cool thing to see.\n\nI wasn\u2019t able to spot the Neowise comet, but that was more due to my need for glasses than light pollution.",

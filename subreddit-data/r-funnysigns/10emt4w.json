For a very long time, there was only a very small niche of ethnicity, sex, and symptoms that were caught early if at all.

Hell, even now in 2023 some doctors will refuse to diagnose you just because maintaining eye contact isn't one of your symptoms. I'm a woman. I never had a chance of being diagnosed bc when I was a kid, it was still a boys only illness and I'm only 30. I only found out 2 years ago.",

And sure it's possible that it's \"just anxiety/depression\" but most autistics are both depressed and anxious bc up until we get a DX, we are all just winging it in a world not really built for us.\n\nDon't worry about what your girlfriend says, she will never know you as well as you do. When it comes to how you're thinking, how you're feeling about things, only you will ever know that. If it's something to explore, don't let her being a nay sayer stop you.",

My friend who\u2019s been diagnosed lives In Scotland and I\u2019m In the U.S. so we typically only hear eachothers voices though we do video call on occasion. \n\nI\u2019ve been known to use a Scottish accent without realizing or using Scottish vernacular for certain words. \n\nI.e. Lift instead of elevator, trolley instead of bus yada yada\n\nI also do it when I\u2019m visiting family who have accents, if I\u2019m with them more than a day or two I just start assimilating into the accent unknowingly, and it takes other people catching me and bringing it up before I realize. \n\nI\u2019ll also do it with personalities, if I\u2019m with my roommate (who\u2019s a narcissist) I\u2019ll start to pickup his way of speaking (which I\u2019m aware isn\u2019t healthy for anyone). \n\nSo my gf\u2019s train of thought is that I\u2019m just picking up on my friends autism and unknowingly playing it up to where I think I\u2019m also autistic. \n\nBut other symptoms include\n\n\u2022Not making Eye Contact\n\u2022Information Dumping (this is a big one for me)\n\u2022Spending weeks-months on an interest and then completely abandoning it for a new one while still retaining all the relevant info for said interest \n\u2022Sensory issues with foods and clothing\n\u2022Sensory issues with being touched \n\u2022Not understanding my own tone of voice while in conversation \n\nThose are all the ones that come off the top of my head. And my gf knows about all these, she\u2019s very accommodating to me and loving/caring. She just doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m autistic, she\u2019s a bit of a skeptic seeing how well I\u2019m able to exist normally in public situations, though I absolutely hate going out in public most of the time.",

Unfortunately, I think all she knows about autism is the stereotype bc most of us do function normally in society even if we're dying inside. That specifically is why we are often refused a diagnosis, because we just mask that well. She sounds very nice, just (not maliciously) pretty ignorant about what actual autism is like. \n\nTo me, at least, you sound like you belong to the club. Especially if you have test scores backing you up.",

I know I am autistic. (I've done plenty of research over months and years) I just don't want to get diagnosed because my DREAM is to become an elementary school teacher and I absolutely want nothing to jeopardize that, since autistic people are often overlooked/ shut down. I hope this makes sense",

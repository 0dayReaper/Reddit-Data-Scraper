I think they overdo it where it's a small item purchase like a bottle of Coke in the middle of far more items purchased. \n\nBy the same token, you have the same logistics regarding shoplifting that already exist. Wouldn't it be easier to simply hide a shoplifted item without scanning / canceling than to scan it? And wouldn't the security alarm go off all the same at the exit? I ask that genuinely. I could be wrong.",

She rung up an expensive vacuum and asked me to take the spider lock off. The way our self checkouts were at the time, the total was at the bottom corner of the screen, so I couldn\u2019t see the total but did see that she had rung up a vacuum. I unlocked the spider lock and brought the vacuum back and set it down. She got ready to pay and saw that her total was only something like $45. She had taken the barcode sticker off like a little Dustbuster and put it on a $500 vacuum. Much more effective than trying to walk out with the vacuum, because she appeared to have paid for it.",

There's a grocery store where I'm from that there's an attendant who sits at a podium just feet away from the self-checkouts with a screen where they can see each of the checkouts though the camera mounted above, plus a readout of each scanned item. The only time you really need assistance is if you're getting alcohol, but you just walk to the podium (it's like 10 feet away), flash your ID, and he approves it from where he sits. Accidentally scanned something twice? He approves it from where he sits. Makes everything fast and hassle free.",

I don't know if it got disabled nationwide because of people abusing it, or they just disabled it at my store due to shrink, but that feature was one of the few things I actually liked about the new self checkout update. It's a pain in the butt having to go over to approve someone's cancellation because they double scanned their tic-tacs, usually at no fault of their own (these machines are sensitive). Granted, I never have any trouble at the self-checkout, but I also work them every day, so I know all the tricks.\n\nADDENDUM: for anyone wondering, the best advice I can give you is to only hold one item at a time, and immediately bag said item after scanning it. This is how we are trained to perform as actual cashiers, and is what the self checkouts are looking for. If you deviate from that, it will throw off the mis-scan system. Plus, it's actually a lot faster than holding multiple items.",

You give the item to the cashier, they put it in a basket, and during slower hours, someone runs it back to the shelves.\n\nSomething that rots is problematic. If you left that, you were being a jerk. But they'd also have someone run that back ASAP. (If you ever find out your store isn't getting frozen goods back immediately, do not shop there. Refrigeration quality can be a store's secret shame).\n\nShop Back isn't really difficult other than figuring out departments. If all else fails, you leave it with that department's register, customer service or the holding area for store items.\n\nFrankly, if you're a cashier, it's a godsend. You get off register duty, which is one of the most thankless and uncertain jobs you'll ever have (along with any other customer service). You roam free reign, and honestly you can avoid going back on register for as long as would sound reasonable to any manager. You can avoid the insane rushes too because no one knows where you are and they're probably too busy to remember you or call you over the intercom.\n\nThe worst you'll get is a free roaming customer with a question. There's a lot of those and no one outside their own department knows the details of where any item is. If you ever get someone who knows where something is, that's mostly their own personal knowledge they took it upon themselves to learn.\n\nI've walked that road. I'm not a Karen. You could have talked to me before assuming that.",

Grocery and retail stores are very uptight about selling alcohol because any underage sale means their license gets pulled. Which means lost sales, fines and investigations by police and the company.\n\nThat's why even if you're clearly old enough, they're going to ID you. And if your license is expired, they can't accept it. They have to have an active form of state issued photo ID verifying age to sell it to you. Every person who can sell you alcohol gets the fear of God trained into them to do it this way or else.\n\nI dreaded asking an older person for their ID. You got people who understood for sure. But that is usually when you'd get the full blown Boomer / Karen stereotype in full effect. You could never be sure on it either because stores do have undercover people come in to make sure you aren't selling alcohol without following proper procedure. *\"Yes, I know you're old enough but I get minimum wage and they're going to fire me if I don't do it\"* we all think to ourselves. There was a little kick in the stomach when you were trained to be the bad guy on this and stood awkwardly getting chewed out by said customer and then the manager who trained you in this came over, gave override approval and got to be the \"customer's always right\" good guy.",

The other day I was *moving* something to the other wide of the scanner for when I was gonna scan it and place it in my bags according to my own organizing, the camera above the scanner actually showed a slowmo recording of me moving something across the scanner but not scanning it, and prevented me from continuing until I moved the item back on the left other side, which was weird because I basically live in a nowhere place and corporate doesn't give a fuck about this store so I was surprised they put such a fancy anti theft thing here (but then again we do have a theft problem from druggies) \n\nBut really, they charge you *at least* a 50% profit on most items. That 20 dollar cake only cost them 10. Those 6 dollar donuts cost them just under 3. Sometimes the mark up is even higher. The 8 dollar fried chicken only cost them a single dollar for that chicken (and idk maybe a dollar tops for frying it too, so 2 dollars).\n\nJust having you buy things and paying for most of it they still come out way on top",

The machines are largely functional when you pay attention to them, but they also have nuances and quirks that take a good chunk of time to learn.\n\nAnd yes, if you \u201cjust listen\u201d to the machine, you\u2019ll get through with minimal issue every time. But if you seriously, honestly believe that grocery customers do anything that even closely resembles paying attention, then you probably have never worked in the industry. Customers will (and regularly do) go to literally ANY LENGTH to ignore rules, signs, directions, and common sense, no matter how noticeable or logical it may be.\n\nHere\u2019s some quirks of my company\u2019s SCO machines that escape people, some understandably so and other infuriatingly so:\n\nMeat packages of certain dimensions must be put on the belt in width-wise.\n\nMachines must be unlocked with a member card before use.\n\nExtra items and bags clog up the security sensors and cause problems, except on certain models of machine when placed on the sensor at specific times.\n\nNo, the OTC button will never work.\n\nNo, the bring-own-bags button will never work, except specifically when I unironically inform a customer about it never working.\n\nThe scanner disables after each item to prevent double-scans, and only turns back on after the expected weight of the item is detected on the security scale following a specific delay time.\n\nDespite the beliefs of certain insistent people, that counter is NOT for counting the bags you brought, but for counting how many paper bags you want to buy. The directions are quite clear.\n\nNo, the machine doesn\u2019t just accept any old payment you throw at it. That would make overcharges terribly common.\n\nYes, that lady just left without paying her $150 grocery bill because she didn\u2019t listen when the machine told her she put her card in backwards. LP has been fed up with her kind for years.\n\nPeople always seem surprised when the printer clearly marked \u201cDO NOT PULL\u201d falls open and throws an error when YOU PULL ON IT. No, they don\u2019t just \u201cdo that on their own\u201d. They\u2019re designed to open like that when idiots pull them so they aren\u2019t constantly being broken when a more important part snaps. Happens dozens of times per shift.\n\nThe express SCO machines have a single security scale following the scanner. Items must be placed on it after being scanned, and their weight must be within the expected tolerances on record, with variance afforded to particular items of more varied weight. Measurements accurate to within 0.01 lb. Max 30lb at once.\n\nThe general SCO machines have 2 motorized belts that move items to a bagging zone after being scanned. Under the first belt are 2 security scales (also with precision to 0.01 lb) in series. Across the first belt is a tower/bar laser height scanner. Across the second belt is a point-to-point laser length scanner.\n\nThe scales do multiple jobs: ensure the scanned item is the one on the belt, ensure that hand-packed items are conforming to Weights &amp; Measures regulations, ensure that larger items can be fully weight-checked, and check that items are moving at the belt\u2019s intended speed (and thus not being manipulated).\n\nThe height scanner verifies the item\u2019s identity against known height data, and makes sure that a customer isn\u2019t \u201cpuppeteering\u201d an item through. The p2p scanner verifies the item\u2019s identity against known length data, and triggers a blockage warning when the bagging area is over-full.\n\nBy process, after scanning a member card, a customer is supposed to scan items one at a time, placing them on the belt/scale one at a time before scanning the next. Then they use the main screen to conclude scanning, process any coupons or discounts, and then select their form of payment, which is then accepted through the appropriate device. The receipt prints, the customer gathers it with their items, and they\u2019re done. Every step is guided with text and audio instructions, as well as the ability to return to previous steps.\n\nProblem is, people regularly and ridiculously find ways to bugger up every single step of the process.\n\nThey don\u2019t scan their member cards, scanning the same item over and over as the machine says \u201cPlease scan your card to begin\u201d and \u201cplease remove the unscanned item\u201d dozens of times while they sit there with no clue why thing won\u2019t work.\n\nCustomers have scanned whole orders this way only to wonder why it won\u2019t let them continue to payment (hint: the button doesn\u2019t show up until at least 1 item is rung up).\n\nThey do tons of other stupid shit, too imperceptive to function. It\u2019s a mess.",

I\u2019m saying that the ability and knowledge to operate them completely correctly in all circumstances is a skill. One that is learned. It may be that it isn\u2019t a particularly difficult skill to learn, but it\u2019s one that almost nobody bothers with. Except shift leads like me, where keeping things running smooth can directly prevent tens of thousands or more dollars in losses from people abandoning carts full of (perishable!) goods because they don\u2019t want to wait in line (yes this is a real problem that we have to track and deal with on a regular basis).\n\nYes, it can be (or appear) quite mundane and as skills go very low-risk, but it has significant differenced from simply being competent. In my particular case, I tend to know *why* the SCO is acting the way that it is, which helps immensely in planning ahead through high business volumes. Also to clarify, most customers have few or no issues regarding our SCOs, and their issues tend to stem from obscure features that they aren\u2019t expected to know. The rate of bumbling dummies is by no means low, but by all accounts they are typically the minority. Sometimes, though, a bunch of them can just pop up all at once and *boy* are those days fun.\n\n(Side-note before continuing: SCOs differ across companies. The ones where I work happen to be particularly over-engineered, as my company has historically put a significant importance on using quality technology. I also happen to know a LOT about how they work, how/why they\u2019re designed as they are, and how they work both with hardware and software.)\n\nAlso of note is that while our particular SCO machines have a ton of quirks and little triggers that tend to cause regular hitches, they are unfortunately there for a good reason. Every single one\\*.\n\nOur single store alone reported a $330,000 negative difference between actual reported profits and projected profits based on amount of product moved. This loss is a cumulative result of theft, haggling, damaged/pilfered goods, and unpaid product.\n\nSingly the most significant source of customers taking unpaid product (NOT theft) is from customers not paying attention at self-checkout. From individual items that they incorrectly believe are scanned to entire orders taken because a failed payment was assumed to have worked, every annoying feature of our SCOs was changed or added in response to these issues, and they are designed to be specifically disruptive in the dire hope that one of them might snap a careless customer out of their inattentiveness long enough for them to realize they fucked up.\n\nSometimes they notice and change. Sometimes they notice and proceed to make the exact same errors with every item in their order. Sometimes they are completely ignorant and waste 5 minutes getting nowhere, or accidentally steal hundreds of dollars of product. Sometimes they trigger so many hitches that the computer locks down and calls someone like me to un-fuck it.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: The machine\u2019s triggers aren\u2019t designed to hitch onto losses, but rather to hitch onto the kind of actions that cause losses. So when an SCO sees multiple items on a belt when it only expects one, or detects weight on the scales that isn\u2019t accounted for by a scanned item, or senses a different weight than expected, it knows this is how stuff is lost. It ain\u2019t perfect, but with hundreds of SCOs across the company, any hole in the security will cause hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars in losses.\n\nBy the same means, the SCOs also protect the customer from accidentally being shorted. A product under the expected weight could be under filled, have a hole, or be mislabeled. Requiring member cards to begin SCO scanning ties the customer\u2019s id to the transaction, allowing us to contact them over items left behind, and to ensure we can perform exchanges and returns without the receipt. It also means that illegal use of stolen cards is easy to track.\n\n(In process of continuing)",

Seriously bummed at missing my chance to actually quantify the stupid amount of detailed info I know about these suckers just for the sake of trying, tho. Ah well, some other poor sucker'll find out :D.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo get to the root of the original message, SCOs are very much self-run devices. At the most basic, SCOs regularly need intervention because there is a lack of trust in the general customer base using it. Put bluntly, regardless of wealth, education, occupation, or near any other factor available to consider, the general customer base cannot be trusted to exercise competent decision-making and problem-solving skills in our stores. Working for my region's largest grocer means I literally have to deal with everyone, because everybody's gotta eat. So yeah maybe it's stretching it to say herding SCOs is a skill, but at the end of the day my customers fall into one of a few categories:\n\n1. People who can competently operate the machine and will usually require 1, but no more than 2 interventions.\n2. People who can't, and require intervention every few items because they either can't learn, won't listen, or can't be bothered to try when they can make a wagie do it.\n3. People who know what they're doing, and are able to avoid all the usual shortfalls and hitches. At most they need age verification for alcohol.\n4. People who are simply outright incapable of operating an SCO machine, and need to have every single step of their transaction performed by the attendant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am very much not exaggerating when I say that I have volumes of stories and experiences that back this up. My store happens to be in a significantly low-crime area with a good sample size of all kinds of people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm tell you with full seriousness that Mr. Smith, with his masters in statistics and a stable 80k job doing the paperwork for his employer's regional LP team, will stand there at the SCO machine and scan the same item 7+ times as the machine tells him exactly why it's not working and he's completely ignoring it and getting annoyed that he can't buy his thing. Then, after being told by an attendant exactly what he's supposed to be doing and why it didn't work, Mr. Smith will stare at the pay terminal with his card in it for another 3 minutes while it reads \"Waiting for payment selection\" because he didn't hit \"Finish &amp; Pay\" on the main screen and continue to wonder why nothing's happening.  \n\n\nMeanwhile I'm running around like a maniac because oh look its game day and absolutely nobody has thought ahead and lines are crazy. My other express SCO is occupied by a customer  who thought it'd be a good idea to buy a sheet cake at SCO, and upon seeing the barcode on the lid tried to scan it by flipping the whole thing. Now she's asking me why she can't get a replacement for her squashed cake which is stupid because she has just been told that even if a replacement could be made that fast, the bakery closed at 1 because they're still short 10-12 staff, and nobody else in the store right now is authorized to operate the bakery because doing so requires taking \\~6 hours of food handling and ops trainings which nobody wants to do for fear of getting pinned with this exact shitty scenario, or worse the scenario that led to 10 bakers leaving in the first place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs this is happening I'm processing the final payment of the kind lady from SCO 9 who I moved to my pay station. She is paying with her partial EBT card balance because WIC is weird on the SCOs and oh look the eWIC servers are down again, and I'm still holding the carton of Marlboro Special Select Ultra Light 100's for the sir holding up my cashier's line on 13. I've manage to usher in the next customer to SCO 6, but now SCOs 6 and 8 need ID overrides and while I'm trying to make my way to 13 to deliver the cigs and also cap her long line off so she can take her 30-min-late break after the current 7 people are checked out of her line. Aaand now SCO 9's light is flashing because the customer is trying to buy a long package of raw beef but they're sending down the belt lengthwise instead of breadthwise, and god damn it I don't know why but that's like one of the only things the SCOs are annoyingly specific about that I haven't found an explanation for yet. And that weird lady who stores her spare change in pill dust-coated bottles is failing to communicate her desire to have help with using the CoinStar machine, because she forgot from last time when I showed her that she's gotta actually press a whole 2 buttons before dumping her money in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn this (very real) scenario, any of the following details significantly improves the efficiency and stress levels of my situation:  \n\n\n1. While actively processing the ID overrides for 6 and 8, I am juggling communicating the small talk niceties with those customers w/o being harsh, and also issuing instructions to people to resolve as many issues without my physical presence as possible. The need to do this on a time budget has caused me to develop a skill to dictate a series of words (calling them sentences is too generous) to a customer which tells them just what they need to know to fix the problem themselves while also providing juuust enough of a disjointed explanation as to why the problem exists such that the time-consuming questions their curiosity tends to generate are suppressed enough to let me break contact and handle the next problem.\n2. The customer on SCO 9 already knowing about the meat rotation issue. Through no small effort on my part, they have been getting better at it.\n3. Calling out to my cashier on 13 to get the carton from me because it'll be faster for everyone involved.\n4. Upside-down cake lady either not being dumb, or me stopping her in time to check her out myself.\n5. ...and many more!",

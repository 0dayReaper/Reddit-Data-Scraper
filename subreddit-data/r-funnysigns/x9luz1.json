But answer me this: does that make something having a faith in a religion inherently immoral, or terrible?

Likewise, how do you know that what you believe about the way this universe works beyond what science can explain is 100% certain either? You can\u2019t. At the end of the day, so long as no one forces anyone else to follow their own religious beliefs, there is no harm that religion produces on society at all. If anything, it should give people who are struggling with depression and anxiety a sense of comfort, identity, and a reason to live.",

I was put in ISS for basically fighting back against bullies (\"we have to punish EVERYONE involved\"), and when I explained to him the situation he basically told me \"yeah, just do whatever you want, I'm not gonna monitor you or anything, so if you wanna read a leisure book or doodle or whatever just go for it.\"\n\nAlmost made me consider getting ISS more often just to escape the monotony of school.",

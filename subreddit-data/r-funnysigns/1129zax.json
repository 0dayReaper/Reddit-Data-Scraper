The [limited release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_release) was deliberate: Grillo was uninterested in releasing the film domestically until it underwent foreign distribution, but the film needed to fulfill the U.S. release obligation required by the [Screen Actors Guild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild) for low-budget films (those with budgets less than $2.5 million that are not for the [direct-to-video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-to-video) market).\n\nThe strategy had the side effect of making it, at the time, the lowest-grossing film in history; it earned just $30 at the box office, from six patrons paying $5 each for admission. Unofficially, its opening weekend netted $20, with the $10 difference due to Grillo personally refunding two tickets purchased by Sheila Moore, the film's makeup artist, who saw the film with a friend.",

Even though it's geared towards a younger audience, I thoroughly enjoyed it! I read it for the first time last year on recommendation from my wife because she really liked it when she read it years ago.",

There were only two bars in town, so everyone just went out without a particular plan and found people to hang out with.\n\nIn my third year, AT&amp;T built a tower, and Verizon got a repeater in a local church. As a result, people didn't show up until the people they already knew were there. It kind of started to suck if your friends were busy.",

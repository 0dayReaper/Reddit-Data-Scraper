The shape of the house creates an amplification chamber out of the dining room that takes sound from one corner of the living room and focuses it straight through my office door toward my desk. If someone is sitting on the side of the sofa near that corner of the living room, I can hear everything they say exactly as though they were in the room with me, even if they whisper. If they\u2019re on the phone I can hear both sides of the conversation, even if they\u2019re not on speaker. I\u2019ve told everyone in the family about this, but no one seems to believe me or remember it. Lucky for me. That seat is the worst in the living room for watching the TV, so it\u2019s not *that* common for people to sit there. It\u2019s very disruptive for work.",

The NEC allows outlets to be installed with the ground plug hole facing up, down or sideways. It\u2019s up to you, there is no standard electric outlet orientation. So that means there really is no such thing as upside down outlets. One way isn\u2019t safer than the other \u2014 as long as the outlet is wired correctly. It all comes down to aesthetics, so install them whatever way looks best to you. Incidentally, the ground plug is typically down in the United States, the opposite of how it\u2019s generally installed in Canada.\n\n&gt; According to John Williamson, Chief Electrical Inspector for the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry (retired), if someone submitted a proposal to change the NEC to require that ALL receptacle outlets be installed with the ground-prong up (or down), they would have to convince industry experts on various code-making panels that the ground-prong up installation was far superior and safer than with the ground-prong down. It\u2019s likely the NEC code-making panels would reject the proposal for lack of substantiation.\n\n\\- - https://www.familyhandyman.com/article/which-is-the-correct-and-incorrect-way-to-install-an-electrical-outlet/",

Sorry you were that kid. I told my son in kindergarten, \u201cif you need to go, get up and go\u201d, I\u2019ll deal with any fallout. That\u2019s a cruel ass thing to do to a kid. Even if others take advantage. They need to let these kids go. No BS.",

So many health issues her entire life because the teachers didn't want anyone doddling in the hallways. It's bullshit. And they can't even use the excuse that it trains you for work because when you're an adult you can get up and go to the toilet any time you like.",

(\u201cJust a sec\u201d could be noticing there\u2019s already a couple kids out- please wait a minute for your turn, or it can mean I\u2019m wrapping up directions (2 minutes) for the learning task on hand and don\u2019t want you to miss out.)\n\nMy students all know an emergency trumps all, and in that case make sure I see you sign (so I know where you are in case of a school wide emergency) and go! : )\n\nWe come up with silly sayings together. Being silly makes it fun and helps them learn that they need a pretty solid reason to interrupt learning.",

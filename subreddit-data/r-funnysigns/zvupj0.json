Triggers may occur with a tenth of a second of contact.[5] The requirement of redundant triggering in this mechanism serves as a safeguard against wasting energy by trapping objects with no nutritional value, and the plant will only begin digestion after five more stimuli to ensure it has caught a live bug worthy of consumption.",

Plus, a healthy flytrap only has 7 traps per plant with others growing to replace them on a constant cycle. And yes, they only continue to stay closed when they detect motion against the hairs when the trap is closed on a potential meal.  I grew a lot of these along with other carnivorous plants for years.",

A plant that only grows naturally in a specific area probably requires that specific habitat. Unlike ivy which is very tolerant to a wide variety of climates. Regulated humidity means just that. It doesn't have a specific number. My buddy grows cactus in a tent with regulated humidity around 20 percent. While I grow philodendrons with a regulated humidity of about 60 percent.",

They were fine and thrived when the only real care I gave them was watering them once or twice a week, maybe daily during extremely hot weather, and bringing them inside during extremely cold weather. They only died because I was in the hospital during a hard freeze and couldn\u2019t bring them inside. They are extremely hardy plants if they are given their basic needs, people just have zero clue how to care for them and fuss over them until they die.",

Not just because they steal the plants, but because they step on the ones they don\u2019t see because they are so small. \n\nI don\u2019t know why people even bother to poach the native plants. There are countless native plants in countless commercial nurseries pumping them out for a couple dollars. And the cultivars are much more robust if you go that route. People suck.",

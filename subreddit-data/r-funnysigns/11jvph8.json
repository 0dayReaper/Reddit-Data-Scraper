After you wiggle the lock open, you can usually see the display electronics.\n\n\n2) Next, seek out the black control panel which is attached to the access panel by a curly cord and a keyboard as its face.\n\n\n3) Not too difficult so far, is it? In terms of programming, you simply scroll down the menu to \u201cInstant Text\u201d and type in whatever you would like to display. Hit Enter to submit, and your message is good to go. If you need more than one \u201cpage\u201d to send your tasteful message, you can add more pages by selecting \u201cAdd page\u201d.\n\nSo if you are still struggling to reach the third step, no worries.\u00a0 If the sign does ask for a password, try \u201cDOTS\u201d the default password. If the motivated crew member did decide to change it, no worries, enter DIPY which will automatically reset the sign's password to DOTS.",

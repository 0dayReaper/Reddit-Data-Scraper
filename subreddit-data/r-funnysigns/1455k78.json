But here's my short review of the book *Ender's Game*, as requested:\n\n I don't normally read science fiction, but Orson Scott Card is a master, and *Ender's Game* is a sci-fi classic that has won numerous awards. Although the setting is science fiction, the science fiction elements are more a backdrop for Card's exploration of the human condition. A suspenseful plot about kids and computer games, with an ironic twist at the end completes the package that has spellbound thousands of readers.  Highly recommended!\n\nBTW, my handle name does originate in the book, but originated as [the handle I used on a boardgame site](https://www.reddit.com/user/EndersGame_Reviewer), where I have posted lots of reviews of boardgames.",

But that's still really a classic and very different from modern board games.  \n\nI'd have a tough time picking just one, because it depends on the occasion and who I'm playing with, and whether I want something light or serious.  \n\nI do have a special fondness for social deduction games though.  One of the ones I've played the most is [One Night Ultimate Werewolf](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1069101/enders-comprehensive-pictorial-overview-essence-we).\n\nAs far as larger strategy games go, my favorite is [Railways of the World](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/66581/railways-world-series-introducing-family-members-i).",

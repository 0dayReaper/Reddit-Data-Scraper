I chose to go to school (regretfully so now , 100k$ in loans). I have since worked for many chefs who never went to formal culinary school but have become head chefs. These people were line cooks mostly, to start with. \nThat's the beauty of my industry,  you don't have to go to school to be good at the nature of the business.",

Her next door neighbor was a Cuban lady that was childless but adored kids. She would invite us over all the time and give us ice cream and tres leches cake and coffee. Cuban coffee, no milk and tons of sugar. It was awesome and jump started my love affair with the Angel's Brew. Zoila was her name, now 60 years gone. RIP ma'am.",

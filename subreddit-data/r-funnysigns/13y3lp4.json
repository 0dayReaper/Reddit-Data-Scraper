He didn't care if you were sick as long as you showed up and worked. One day, I had a bad stomach bug and called in to let him know that I wouldn't be coming in and he gave me hell for it. I told him I would come in but it might not be on time. The entire time, I'm sweating profusely, feel nauseous, and have felt like I've lived on the toilet. As soon as I get there, I head straight to the bathroom and he yells at me to get to work. I had enough and one of my coworkers came to try and help. I told him to go get a oversized ziplock bag. You can see where this is going.\n\nBeing a teenager with no fucks given, I had explosive diarrhea in that bag. I zipped it up, put it on his desk, and quit. Everyone else there started clapping and cheering me on. He called my house and left loud swearing voicemail messages but I didn't care and my parents ignored calls for the next few days from that store. I later found out that two other people quit the same night and that the area manager got involved.\n\nWould I do that now? Oh no..... Was it worth it then? Yes!",

I\u2019m not hauling my sick ass out of bed, driving to my doctor, only for a note that says what I already know. Especially because some professors required a 24 notice? How am I supposed to know at 10:00pm when I go to sleep that in nine hours I\u2019ll be puking?\n\nI\u2019m taking the day to rest and get better, and going all the way to the doctor isn\u2019t going to help me. \n\nI just usually accepted I wasn\u2019t going to get attendance credit for that day and move on.",

While pregnant mother continue to work if there is no damger for the baby, when they birth they have 18 base week and 32 week they can split with the father. so 15 week for the short leav+ 27 weeks or 18 maternity week + 32 parental.\n\nFaternity week is 5 weeks+ whaterver the hubby take from 32 as needed. On top of that they both can rake up to 2 years unpaid or vacations+ whatever they have set aside no questions asked. \n\nTake me for example, first baby I took 5 week and wife took 50.\n\nSecond baby, I took 37 weeks and my wife 18 (about 4 month and she went back to work) I was at home with my 2 kids, best experience ever for bonding as a father and the full 18 weeks with my wife was really nice, her not being alone all the time gave her so much needed support.\n\nThird and last we were supposed to split leave it evenly but we decided it was better for me to take it all because I was building our home (all of this while taking care of a newborn  and 2 kids) It was a fun ride. now they are 11-12 and fourteen. 3 nice little humans, I love em. \n\nAll this thanks to our provincial and canadian parental leaves.",

The Korowai tribe hasn't actively practiced ritual cannabilism in almost 50 years, and this isn't like a diet thing, it's a sacred ritual to reclaim the body from an evil spirit. It's more akin to capital uthenasia but with a healthy dose of Tibetan sky burial.\n\nYall talk about cannibals as if they are savages that just eat people, but in all honesty, they don't eat people any more than we admin the death penalty in our society.\n\nHigh key, different strokes.\n\nEdit: also a tribal people, and an established colonial government, are not the same thing. Additionally, the Polynesian tribes that occupy those islands are predominantly matriarchal, and most of them don't work in a type of situation where they are reimbursed monetarily. So all the white British officials and foreign workers probably get paid maternity leave, but that has litterally zip to do with the tribal populace that still lives in village setting.",

Apparently, this is still a thing even, in a booming market with tons of competition. Good luck!\n\nETA, this was PTO on top of national holidays. They think that's enough time off work. Bye!",

They were told they were needed at the moment but that they\u2019d get cut down as soon as they were able (that never happened so he wound up putting in notice and quitting during finals, since you also can\u2019t take unpaid leave during the holiday season).  Despite being part time, they both also worked five days per week, 6-7 hours per day. \n\nTwo other people in his department wanted full time hours, but they were told that there weren\u2019t enough available at the moment. I don\u2019t know if they didn\u2019t think they\u2019d talk to one another or if they just didn\u2019t care; all were gone within a year, but I suppose they were fine with that because they were disposable.",

I lost my house and am working 7 days a week, can't make overtime, can't make rent especially as I have no credit history, shelters want to split me and my partner of 11+ years because we are not married even knowing we have medical issues we help each other with, I have a lump on my chest and even if medical was completely free which it is far from I still would miss work and more then 2 days a month is a risk of not being able to pay bills and taxes. I am qualified for well paying jobs but they don't higher people without homes as well as actively fire anyone homeless even if you are between houses because you just moved out but haven't found a new place is a risk.\n\nBasically all I can do is either join a system that will make my situation worse to keep face or do shitty work like for delivery companies that abuse you or companies that make you hold signs on a corner which to me feels like panhandling for someone else with a fraction of the pay.\n\nAnother example of the shit cake. Gig workers get paid less and less by employers who expect tip to make ends meet. Like it's $15 legally for minimum wage for an hour. I have made $8 an hour before which they get around by saying tips should be making it $20 an hour... Which most of the time it doesn't, that $8 was with tip. They make you sign a contract so you can't sue for basically anything. I know a bartender who makes $2.50 an hour and the job was advertised as $25 an hour but that was supposed to be with tip.\n\nThis situation is going great for business as the stupid public is mad at the wrong people. It's oh stupid driver took so long my foods cold as they don't know we only accept an order if it more than covers gas and maintenance as we also need money. The drivers are all mad that the customers are tipping bad so we can't take the order when it's supposed to be the employers job to provide a living wage for the employees not the customer directly paying wages so the company can pay less on wages and taxes.",

Stay smart and keep everything between you and your company on a record. Writing or recordings are ideal.\n\nHonestly, no days off is more commonplace. There is no federally insured leave unless you need surgery or get significantly injured on the job, in which case FMLA leave is allowed, and your job is (supposed to be) protected. The thing is that your doctor has to provide proof, and if they don't, your leave gets denied, and you have no protections on your job. A lot of jobs use this as an opportunity to fire employees they don't like or employees they feel \"aren't productive enough\". Some will even fire you if you *are* on FMLA leave, which is illegal and you can sue the company. Have anything communicated between you and the company on recordings or in writing, preferably both. Stay smart and up to date US readers.",

I had suicidal ideations on my birthday about 2 years ago. I went to the ER and was put in a room IN THE ER for over a WEEK. Just sitting there. Because there was no room ANYWHERE. The nearest place that opened after a week was almost 3 hours away. So, that means I had suicidal ideations on my birthday, went to the ER, stayed in the ER for a week, finally got transferred to a mental health facility. AND THEN THEY TOLD ME I WAS FINE !! \u201cYou might have an addiction forming but thats all Im concerned about\u201d is what they told me. Sorry not sorry for the rant. My heart goes out to everyone. No matter the circumstances but I really feel for people who want to get help but are unable to do so. Thanks for reading.",

Not to rely on you, one can only get sober by themselves but not alone. I would also suggest joining a program. I would recommend AA even if alcohol isn't the problem. You can sub alcohol for any substance. It is about the fellowship. Also don't latch onto the God part, it says a \"power higher than myself\", that power can be the person next to you not some celestial entity. Seeing my father become sober over my life has been an amazing thing and I know your brother can do it. He will be in for a really rough time but there will be a light at the end and he'll be back loving life and living life on life's terms. God speed, hope to bro stays on the wagon and lives a happy life.",

Consequently, the stigma surrounding substance abuse is not really seen as acceptable or humorous. The attitude of seeing addiction as a character flaw is increasingly seen as discriminatory and stemming from ignorance. For this reason, the joke sign is falling a bit flat. It is increasingly akin to joking about someone coming home from the hospital or having some other illness.",

If you don't think it's funny , this isn't the thread for you. I'm sure there is a support sub for families of meth addicts. It would not hurt to learn to take yourselves a little less seriously and also remember that laughter is a great coping mechanism. \n\nI hope all the family members of meth heads find the support they need and their loved  ones stay clean.

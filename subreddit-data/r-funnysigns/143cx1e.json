I have one book for food times, one in the bathroom, one upstairs to read during commercials. and one in the car to read in line, at Starbucks, picking up groceries, etc. Biggest problem I've had is when I go from one written in first person to another in first person. but I do think it's good for my brain. I challenged my mom to do the same, but too late for her to remember to switch books. (she has trouble keeping up with one book right now.)\n\nand, yeah, I have a bunch of books that looked good when I got them, but now I'm never in the mood to read them.",

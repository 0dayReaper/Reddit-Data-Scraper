As someone who hauled frozen stuff for a long time, believe me, you don't want ice cream melting in the trailer. That's how you wind up hauling a load of ants.",

Not just them, but taxi drivers, bus drivers... It's not about the vehicles, but drivers being awful. (And ofc there are plenty who drive well, and don't deserve to be shitted upon.)",

Sometimes they just start moving into my lane on the moment. Jesus Christ, especially them should know that other drivers are unpredictable. Some of them really don't feel like professionals, when it's literally their profession.\n\nCity buses, in some areas have their own lanes. Most of the time idiot private drivers don't go on them, but when they do even I get mad at them. \n\nI'm not saying we should be rude to them or we, private drivers, should have a higher priority, but we all need to be more focused, to plan ahead our moves, signal to others, ~~put aside the phone \"Mr Important\"~~...

And even if everyone agrees on paper, how do you enforce it when someone decides to cut corners? All it really takes is one sufficiently powerful country to decide they can get away with it, and the whole plan falls apart.

I could do my job without worrying about some cockwad passing 30 feet in front of me and slamming on the brakes to make a right turn. All this bullshit about how I need to be in the right lane at all times, except if they're trying to merge on to the highway at 32 mph, then I need to get over and give them room! God forbid I have to exit on the left in traffic - I need to stay in the right lane to appease the king of the cocklords, then hope and pray 497 of his identical nutslapping turd clones have it in their hearts to back off a bit and let me get over.

American truckers are probably different than most other countries.  \n\nFor one, most Americans feel entitled to something period...

Also probably feel people should look out for them... Because they will most likely kill you if you collide with them... (Which is why I usually give them a respectful distance.)",

It's much more difficult and expensive for them to adjust to personal vehicles than it's for us to adjust to them, everyone should follow the traffic rules of course. But it takes much more fuel for a truck than a car to break and accelerate constantly.\n\n\nOn the sea (atleast in my country) you always yield for a \"working boat\", a boat who's skipper is on the job, for example a passager ship, a commercial fisher, coast guard etc.\n\n\nTruckers should of course not act like asshole and completely not give a shit about anybody else.\n\n\nEdit: Oh I just remembered American truckers like to throw bottles of pee everywhere, that doesn't happen here. So maybe the US ones are a separate breed.",

The scale that truck freight operates at vs truck freight makes it largely a non-starter. \n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for 14 pallets of material to need to be sent from WI to UT. A single train car can hold 56 pallets. So, you\u2019d need to coordinate around 4 businesses all going from roughly the same place to roughly the same destination at the same time. Just to fill one rail car.\n\nThat also ignores the issue of how do we get those 14 pallets from the shipper to the rail car in the first place. There are plenty of factories that are hundreds of miles from the nearest rail line and there are plenty that are in the middle of cities where we\u2019d have to demolish buildings to run the rail line in the first place.\n\nFor local deliveries it\u2019s worse. Imagine running a rail spur to your local target. At least for mine you\u2019d have to tear up both roads and houses.\n\nNow you might be thinking why not just centralize the factories? Ignoring the economic and environmental cost of moving 10\u2019s of thousands of businesses. The biggest ongoing issue would be labor. Getting people to and from that centralized industrial site would be a logistical nightmare. The obvious answer is again trains, but now you\u2019d need additional sets of tracks for passenger rail and you\u2019d likely be increasing commute times for employees beyond the current frustration of getting stuck behind a semi on the interstate anyway.\n\nEven if we did all of that there would still be edge cases were trucks are needed because a rail line can\u2019t be laid in the first place.\n\nDon\u2019t blame the trucks. Blame the automotive industry that spent decades tearing out easily accessible public transportation from our cities and making sure it didn\u2019t come back. Forcing everyone into suburban hell.",

Don't expect a promotion from over working yourselves. If someone told me \"you might be overlooked\" I just go \"darn\" and punch out. Hell, I have called out \"sick\" because employers denied a day off request. Because with me it's not a request it's me letting you know I'm not coming in. And now you gotta pay me sick time for it since you want to play games. And believe it or not I have never been fired. If you cement into their heads that if they mess with your personal time you are going to casually and professionally make it the biggest fucking headache for them they tend to let you be. All this only reliably works when you are really good at your job. Each job I left because they didn't address issues I brought up to them or they were being funny with my money. And every time I quit with no more than a \"today is my last day\" notice. And have always laterally promoted to better pay, hours and commute. So in short, fuck em, you can replace a job, you can't replace missed time with your family. So yeah the ridicule is semi warranted if you don't have the backbone to tell your employer to shove it up his ass when they demand you take extra time from family.",

Being an on call employee must be disclosed and cannot be hidden from the employee prior to the signing of this contract.

Right-to-work means that you can't be forced to join a union as a condition of employment. A quick google says 27 states are right-to-work.\n\nWhen people use the term \"right to work,\" what they usually mean is \"at-will employment,\" which is where an employer can fire you at any time, for any reason, such as poor job performance, or they don't like your shoes. (Standard exceptions: no discriminatory reason, can't be because you filed an OSHA complaint, etc.) 49 states are \"at-will employment\" states. Montana is the only exception.\n\nSo when someone mentions \"right to work\" states when they're talking about at-will employment, or mentions \"at-will employment states\" when nobody said anything about Montana and at-will should be the assumed default in the USA, it's a pretty clear indicator that they're uninformed. Redditors on average are pretty bad at any kind of legal issue, but they really glow dimly on employment law topics. It's wild how often commenters tell someone they should sue their former employer for \"wrongful termination\" for no valid reason, or misuse the term \"hostile work environment.\"\n\nTo be clear I'm pretty far left and pro-workers' rights. Which is why I think it's very important that people know exactly what these terms mean and how they apply, know exactly what their rights are, and focus their energy appropriately. Rather than being subjected to a bunch of bullshit that sounds pro-worker, but is just mis/disinformation.",

It's quite the nuisance. If I wanted a cat, I would have rescued one. I'm half tempted to say, \"Nope. My cat now.\" and keep them.",

Unless you live on a farm type situation, letting a cat out is considered irresponsible to the ecosystem and a danger to them as well. \n\nI\u2019ve seen many cat pieces during hikes and whatnot from being ripped apart alive by coyotes or snatched up by an owl/bird of prey. \n\nLetting them outside isn\u2019t a recommended choice. Once they go outside they are part of the food chain again and can be a pest for more than just the local birds. If you have trouble with a bored cat you can try training, more personal play time, or another cat buddy for them.",

They don't bother even giving it the minimal of training, or learning about the cats personality, or spending time with it. They just wanted a pet that won't bark and will leave them alone (which the cat leaves them alone because it's been neglected all it's life).\n\nI genuinely don't understand how you can think of your animal like a companion...and go let it run around outside freely. If it was your dog you'd be worried sick (as a note I'm in the south western US...It's NOT a friendly area for pets outside).",

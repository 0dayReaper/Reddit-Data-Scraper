It\u2019s likely that no one is working full-time here. So, let\u2019s say a half-time employee would be receiving $3,120 of mystery benefits.\n\nIf they worked 5 days a week and ate $7 worth of snacks\u2026 (5 x $7 x 52 weeks) that\u2019s $1820 in snacks/yr. Worthwhile to note this could be a business expense (tax deduction) for the company.\n\nWorking 5 shitty half-time shifts/wk\u2026 that leaves $1300 in mystery benefits. Assume management had the nerve to include a $0.50/hr *potential* raise in their calculation. (1040 hrs * $0.50 = $520)\n\nWe\u2019re down to $780 of mystery benefits. For a half-time employee earning $13/hr that\u2019s 60 hours of of sick leave! But you can\u2019t use it without a doctor\u2019s note, you don\u2019t have medical insurance, and most sane people don\u2019t go to a doctor because they\u2019re sick for one day.\n\nI wonder what value they place on the \u201csupportive work environment\u201d people keep quitting.",

I had a full time job in addition. \n\nBut I will tell you this, the only people who were able to live off the full time (32 hr/week) pay there, even if they had been there decades and were earning over $15/hr, were those that didn\u2019t have to pay for housing.

I basically did everything but cook the food lol. I prepped the front counter while taking orders, running orders, cleaning tables, cleaning bathrooms, restocking, making custom gift bag orders, making specialty coffees, answering phones and basically anything that had to be done because the daughter of the family didn\u2019t like anyone helping me. All of that to only get paid minimum wage and to have to split my tips with everyone else, including the daughter and son that almost never did any work. I also found out the daughter and son were getting more of the tips than we were. The mom said it was because the work they did \u201cafter hours\u201d, but you\u2019d ride by that place after hours and no one would be there and if they were, they were sitting down on their phones not doing anything. Plus I didn\u2019t get how it was fair for them to get the tips I EARNED during our busy hours for working after hours when no one was there and there was nothing to do.\n\nI finally quit, and the cook followed me when I quit because she said without me the place was in shambles. I recently looked on their Facebook page and seen where they can\u2019t even run their full business hours anymore because they can\u2019t get anybody to work for them lol. I don\u2019t even feel bad for them. You can\u2019t treat your workers like dirt and underpay them, and expect them to stay.",

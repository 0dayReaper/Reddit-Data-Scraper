So when everyone complained a few years back about giving the department of agriculture more money, what they were really doing was complaining about funding school lunch programs. The department of agriculture runs school programs because it allows them to force companies into taking excess production, such as milk,  when Scholls are out of session. This means a cheese company is obligated to take excess milk production that would normally be used for school lunches and utilize it for cheese etc.",

I had never seen anything like it, but the high school was essentially a giant farm so we had fresh real mashed potatoes, pitchers of whole milk on the table, fresh chicken and beef, all kinds of fresh vegetables and fruits, homemade bread and homemade butter\u2026 It was crazy. We got to go up for seconds - all you wanted to eat and it was amazing.\n\nI went back to the regular high school the following year and the lunch was horrible. Lol.",

The requirement that each child be given a fresh fruit and vegetable option was one of Michelle Obama's nutrition initiatives.

But the hope was that the younger children would adapt the fresh foods into their daily lives and the waste would eventually become less and less over time as the littlest kids grew up with it.

It's just that when you write a rule/policy/law there have to be some hard boundaries, and then as a result there are always going to be some weird grey area scenarios you didn't anticipate or couldn't address without impossibly overcomplicating things.  \n\nIt probably goes something like this:  \n\n* let's provide free lunch for kids who can't afford it  \n* Ok, but how are we going to determine who can't afford it and track/enforce that in a fair way that isn't super complicated?   \n* Good point, it would be a lot simpler and fairer to just provide free meals to everyone.  \n* Ok, but does that mean *everything* is just free?  Can a kid just take an unlimited amount of anything, because it's free?  \n* No, let's limit it to one item maximum per category.  \n* That makes sense.  But what about the kid who just takes a bag of chips every day?  Our funding is meant to provide nutritious meals to kids who might not get them at home.  If we're just a potato chip supplier to some kids, we're kind of doing the opposite.  \n* Good point, good point.  Why don't we define a free meal as exactly one item from every category?  \n* That sounds like a good compromise.  But what about the kid who takes everything and throws it all away except the chips?  \n* We don't have the right to force someone to eat something, but we are obligated to provide it.  So I guess we'll just have to accept that this might happen sometimes.",

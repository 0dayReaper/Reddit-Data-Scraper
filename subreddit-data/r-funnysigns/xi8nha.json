I was worried somebody would panic and cause an accident, so I called 911 (from a parking lot, not while driving) and told them the location. It really was a potentially dangerous situation, but it did seem a bit odd to be calling 911 about a sofa cushion.",

Gotta at LEAST place the call so that it\u2019s on record that your plates were stolen BEFORE anything else happens.",

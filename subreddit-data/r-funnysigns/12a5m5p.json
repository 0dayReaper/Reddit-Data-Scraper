Went to one sword shop, been there a few times and had probably spent close to $2,000 there, and the person behind the counter asked what I'm looking for. I said either something unique or not that expensive. (I was always down to buy a few pocket knives and gift them to friends for holidays/birthdays.) He said we have neither of those here, leave.\n\nLeft and never came back. A year later the shop was closed after being there for a long time.

You then ask again to draw it if you feel comfortable to hold a sword. You then pull it out 5 inches and from there slowly unsheath it from the scabbard. You never touch the blade. If space allow it you may then ask to feel the balance, and then slowly take a posture. Don't assume you just get a yes. Even dull swords are dangerous.",

In my area, all the drive through lines are incredibly long now, and half the lobbies are closed forever. Also, they rarely get my order correct anymore (I don't even order anything complicated).\n\nI used to swing by on my way to work or on break. I have given up. It might be 5 minutes or 35 minutes. I might waste some very precious gas. Don't you think having adequate staff might clear up that line? So pay them!",

Long wait times.... incorrect orders... places are frequently closed when they should be open because nobody wanted to show up to work... I can't count how many times i've been at the drive through window and hear employees arguing/fighting/being miserable inside.   I've seen an increase in customers being hostile to the workers because of the shitty service too.  This shit is reaching a tipping point, something needs to change.  I sympathize with the workers completely.  They deserve a living wage.  \n\nI'm in South Florida and Miami is officially the most expensive city in America now (cost of living wise), even over New York City.  These workers do not make enough money to survive.  Its awful.",

It used to be worth it. Not anymore. Between the traffic and the gas prices, it's not worth it. You can't expect minimum wage employees to sit in traffic for an hour and spend soooo much of their wages on gas. They can't afford to live there so you just gentrified your neighborhood out of service workers lol",

Once 1-2 core people leave, the others will shortly follow suit. \n\nLong-story short, despite what some pro-capitalist multi millionaires, business owners may think, more often then not, most workers with experience are not expendable. You can\u2019t teach years worth of experience. Eventually, there\u2019s nobody even left to train the would be replacements, and then the cycle finally comes to an end. Sales are down. Customer complaints are at an all time high. Employee morale is down. Employee staffing is down.

Hell, if you're in a place like Granada just order your drink and someone will dump a plate of tapas in front of you for free anyway.\n\nBut, fast food? 20 mins sometimes at BK or McDonald's even if there's not obviously anyone else waiting. You can eat you fill at the local places before someone gives you food at the american style places",

My GF, sitting right next to me, couldn\u2019t understand anything he said either. \n\nThis was the first (and only) time I\u2019ve ever felt legitimately compelled to call corporate. Like I drove 20 minutes, and sat in line for another 15+, just for the cashier to speak a non-existent language? Surely, this isn\u2019t an effective business model. I didn\u2019t call corporate. I just chose to never go back. Sucks, because IMO, when it\u2019s done right and fresh, Popeyes has the absolute BEST fried chicken sandwiches out of everyone (take it from me, I used to work at CFA for like 3.5+ years; most of the time as a BoH Breader).",

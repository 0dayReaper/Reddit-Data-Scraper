Idk why you\u2019re staking a \u2018good or bad\u2019 sense of humor on an old lady flipping the bird, seems an odd choice to hang your hat on to me. I\u2019m starting to think you\u2019re the one with a questionable sense of humor. If this is really THAT funny to you then the bar is pretty low, no offense.",

It's a modern interpretation on the works of Thomas Malthus, massive bad person who influenced the west into letting poor people die and sterilizing them forcefully because then the world would be left to the \"good people\". He had this theory that population would increase so much that there would be no food left for anyone. Both his theory and the predictions he made based off of it turned out to be very wrong. \n\nI don't know how environmentalists went from taking care of the environment or fight against harmful practices to... whatever this is.\n\nIt's called Malthusianism.\n\nI am a teacher.

He's just plain wrong about anti-natalism being some modern version of Malthusianism.\n\n [Malthus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_on_the_Principle_of_Population) wasn't opposed to reproduction *in general*.  Malthus argued that the poor reproduced too quickly, thereby exacerbating poverty, and that therefore government aid to the poor should be curtailed as to discourage reproduction among them. Modern takes on that idea would be someone like Paul Ehrlich who wrote a book called The Population Bomb in the late 60s (right when the rate of global population growth was at its highest). The only possible way to connect anti-natalism to Malthusianism is the idea that they are both concerned with human impact on \"the environment\", but that's a pretty tenuous connection. Malthusians are concerned that resources from the environment are insufficient to support humanity. Anti-natalists are more concerned that the natural environment is being depleted or destroyed by humanity. But that is just one of many arguments made by anti-natalists, most have nothing to do with the environment.\n\nI guess another way to put all this is that fundamentally Malthusianism addresses a practical problem (how can we balance population growth with the availability of resources?), while anti-natalism addresses an ethical / moral problem (is it right to create new life?).",

They aren\u2019t suggesting killing Anyone off, just not making new people. Especially when we don\u2019t take much care at all for many of the people who already exist (such as poor, oppressed, sick, homeless, etc) or will exist in less than ideal conditions (I.e severe and extreme disability). Moreover I believe it\u2019s increasing in popularity due to the nature of capitalism crushing working class, reproduction aged millennials/gen-z who are among the first generation(s) of Americans to exist that have a lower quality of living than their parents.",

Just a century ago it was around 4 billion. Having less children can be more beneficial for the planet as a whole and lead to less need for resources, less pollution, etc. plus there is another side to it. It is extremely hard to take care of kids, and it\u2019s better to maybe have 1 or 2 and give them a good life than have 3 plus and struggle to take care of any of them",

It\u2019s interesting that people dismiss it by saying they\u2019re just miserable when to me that kind of supports the point? The existence of people that are dissatisfied with life enough to think that bringing new life into the world is a moral negative who were very likely born to two people that did not share that view means that two perfectly happy people can birth a child who suffers enough to not want to be alive. Every time you have a child you\u2019re gambling with the possibility of creating someone that dislikes living, and once you\u2019re alive you\u2019re pretty much stuck living unless you want to cause suffering to those around you. Maybe you think it\u2019s worth the risk, but is it really hard to see why people who have been negatively affected by people taking that risk would not agree?",

Like, a lot of people only have 1 kid, and if these people are at an elementary school it probably means they're dropping their 1 kid off at school and are already congratulating themselves for deciding not to have a second.\n\nFor the rest, in America, if we assume [most people have their kids 2.5 years apart](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/many-u-s-moms-have-babies-too-close-together/), and the average fertility rate is [1.784 births per woman](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/fertility-rate), then by the time a parent arrives to drop their oldest kid off for their first day of school at age 4 or 5, they likely have their other 0.784 kids chilling in the second car seat and have already decided to not have more.\n\nSo yeah, it's kind of a dumb place to protest.\n\nDisclaimer: there are probably some conditional and other probabilities that at least partly undermine the conclusion I've reached, so take with a grain of salt. On its face, at least, I think it sounds reasonable, though more digging might show that I'm wrong.",

No matter how much happiness one achieves, it doesn't change the fact that you will go through physical and emotional turmoil at times and eventually die. Death is scary in and of itself, with all evidence pointing to a cessation of one's identity (and those who do subscribe to belief an afterlife often believe in some form of punishment for the majority of mankind, so that certainly doesn't help matters).\n\nAnti-natalists argue that every birth is an injury, since there's no consent on the part of the person being born. Hence, if you slow or stop the birthrate, the amount of pain in the world will decrease as a result. For those who are already alive, there's more opportunity to take care of themselves and each other.\n\nWhile I get the idea, it feels way too nihilistic for me personally. Certainly merits discussion, though.",

I can spot a typo almost by glancing at a page, and I can type super-fast, thanks to the terrifying nuns\u2026 but I was taught the only type abortion was \u2018partial birth abortion\u2019 (healthy baby is born, but just the head, and the doctor scrambles their little brains with scissors, since it\u2019s not fully born, it counts as abortion). And that jesus, Mary, the holy spirit, maybe a few more, were always watching me, were next to me all the time, reading my thoughts, and I felt anxious in the bathroom. \n\nEither way- indoctrination is crazy!",

We love him unconditionally and would do anything for him, but the threat of nuclear war, climate disaster, impending civil unrest and having to exist in a job market dominated by emerging AI and a political class that sees Americans as commodities to exploit is not the future we would have picked, but here we are! We now have to prepare him for that, and we were not prepared even a little for any of this by our parents. To say we are scared is the understatement of the century.",

Many do, and many do it without fully understanding the consequences of bringing a life into existence. Too many parents treat their children like slaves, and even more parents put the burden of their child\u2019s existence, on the child itself.\n\nI do think things are changing for the better, parenting as whole seems to be improving, with people actually taking the time to talk to their children to understand their perspective. Do I think we need to stop reproducing all together? No. However,\n\nIf you can tell me a good reason why we need more bodies on this burning planet, I\u2019d love to hear it, cause as of right now, I don\u2019t think the anti-natalists are the crazy ones",

All of my friends have had some kind of emotion or developmental trauma to where life is unhappy and hard to us, all of us on medication but one. The majority of people I am friendly acquaintance with either don't want kids or have 2 or fewer kids. I personally feel like humanity is a blight in the planet. I don't want wars and disease and massacres to happen, but the birth rate to ever so slowly wind down until we at least return to being a creature of nature. \n\n\nAll of this is to say, I 100% will judge you and think \"Jesus christ do you know know what a condom is\" when you have more than 3 kids, and I realize it's a pessimistic world view. I think humanity is ruining the earth for ourselves and other species. However, it takes a special kind of idiot to protest this, as I firmly believe that no one will take you seriously. From a mentally ill to another, Jesus these people are fucking mental.",

I can see that we need to slow the births down and make sure that every time a child is born that they are in a home that wants them and will love them, care for them and will give them all the education that they have available to that family.  The families can be poor or rich.  All that matters is that when the babies are born.  That they will have a loving and safe home with a family that wants them.  We are having too many babies that are being born and they immediately have no one that will love them and care for them properly. The fact that we still have orphanages full of \"unwanted\" children around the world is appalling.  I understand that not every person wants to have a child.  That not every couple wants to have more than one or 2 children.  But until we can figure out how to slow then stop the amount of unwanted children in the world.  We need to focus on the ones that are here now and find them homes immediately.  There are so many couples that want children but can not have them.  Yet they can not get one of the ones in orphanages because they cant afford it, dont have perfect homes. So many stupid reasons.",

Often it is because they had drugs when the children were born and they aren't getting clean. Other times it is because the parents went to prison. And because this happens when the children are older the typical wannabe parent is going to try for their own kid or try to adopt a newborn. \n\nwhen a baby is born it is very easy to find a family that will love and support them. there is a very long waiting list for adopting newborns. there's 36 times the amount of couples as there are adoptable newborns. it is simply not the case that there are too many babies being born without having anyone to love and care for them properly.",

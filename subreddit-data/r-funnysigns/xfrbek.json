We could not give most info from iPhone users, even if you were the head of the account. If the user had an android, we could basically hand over their whole account no questions asked. Literally remember a mom coming in asking for her daughters msgs because she believed she ran off with some boy, unfortunately for her, her daughter had an iPhone. Because of that, we couldn\u2019t share with her that data/info. This was in \u201815/\u201816 btw and I\u2019m far from that industry but still.",

You can move things about after the fact.\nYou can also combine multiple pixels into one resulting in a sharper image compared to what you would record natively.\n\nAt this sensor size it makes no sense whatsoever but for large sensors it makes sense.",

They only make high end products and market them as products for the elite - of course Samsung is \"losing\" there when they're also focused on serving to mid and low range markets as well\n\nI'm a tinkerer so I can't stand iOS's inflexibility but iPhones are great if you're happy with the stock experience....and most people are so they'll continue to upgrade to new versions, especially because the fan base is likely in deep with their walled garden ecosystem.\n\nSo Samsung probably knows this won't get anyone to switch, they're just teasing Apple for being consistently late to the feature party",

They're pretty durable seeing as my current one has gone down the stairs about four times and my baby niece has nommed on it. I'm currently on an S10, which the model is a couple years old at this point (not as old as the 6S tho that's pretty cool.)\n\nI know how to work both, it's just my preference as a user with my experiences.\n\nEdit: Guys stop with the \"just get a case\" bullshit. One, cases only do so much. They do quite a bit, but it's still so much and android, samsung, whatever has always had better marks FOR ME when I comes to getting dropped, thrown or anything of the source. AND I HAVE A CASE. Even before I got a case my phone easily took tumbles and falls like they were nothing. I didn't comment about having a PREFERENCE just for people to go \"just get a case.\"\n\nAlso, I'm not paying $80 for a case when I could just get a more durable phone and a $7 case that actually looks good.\n\nEdit 2: can iPhone users just stop. I said I had a preference from my experiences. I wasn't shitting on iphone and I've said in multiple comments that their quality had gotten better. Again. I said my preference with my experiences. Just stop with the \"well actually\" comments because they're annoying and rude.",

I shit talk Apple to everyone I know and now no one in my house owns an Apple.\n\nSamsung honestly isn't all that great either. LG phones were where it was at. They had the least bloatware and annoying features of any phone I have ever had and they were cheap and durable as shit. If you ever did break the screen, you could replace it for 50$ with a new screen off ebay and a tiny screwdriver.\n\nToo bad I can't get LG anymore so I have to settle for Samsung. The cameras are decent I guess, but it keeps harassing me to use samsung pay which is annoying.\n\nMore shit on Apple - they use child labor to make their phones and they claim to be environmentally friendly but implement anti-repair technology into their phones, incentivising people to throw away their phones and buy new ones.",

There's a reason Apple is maxing at 4k but providing better formats to output to (ProRes I mean). If we wanted to go a higher resolution, something like 6k would be much better. You could output at 6k, still be able to scale it 150%, and retain a 4k image.",

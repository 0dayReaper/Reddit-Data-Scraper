When asked what the most important commandment was, Jesus said to love your neighbor as yourself, and to love God with all your heart and mind and soul.  This guy doesn\u2019t appear to be loving his neighbor or God if he is at these events just to walk around with a sign basically judging others and he is probably not loving the people he is there to judge.  Jesus also said that God hates a haughty eye, i.e. anyone who looks down on any other person as being inferior in any way.  I remember once at a Native American museum somewhere in Tennessee that an Indian chief had read through a Bible that was given to him by white missionaries and he said something like, \u201cThis a very good book.  The White Man ought to follow its teachings.\u201d  This reminds me that there can be a very big gulf between people who call themselves \u201cChristians\u201d and people who actually follow the teachings of Christ.",

He was saying his job is to offer a means to salvation (saving them) by his sacrifice on the cross. During Jesus' life he was most concerned with the 'inferior' as you say. The poor, broken, orphans, sinners etc. Choosing to argue over translations is missing the whole point. I mean what is the meat and potatoes of the book? What does it really say? I think we have to get past this and read the document as a whole and not get hung up on the small translation irregularities.",

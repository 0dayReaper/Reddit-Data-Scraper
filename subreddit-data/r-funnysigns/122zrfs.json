The cases of rape, molestation, and assault being reported booming. Past and present. Especially now that it is more safe for children to have their voices heard. Even some adults are coming out about the abuse they suffered as children. As for politicians, we all know there are pedos in office Republican and Democratic Party. Mostly documented cases in the Republican Party. \nBut , do your research. It\u2019s more common than we think. They usually get a slap on the wrist.

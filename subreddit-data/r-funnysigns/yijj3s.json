You have to advertise and put in the effort, which isn't a big deal, especially if you all want to celebrate. No one here really decorates, and half the neighborhood turns off their lights. So of course all the kids are going to go somewhere they are actually wanted. \n\nHonestly, I'm not against trunk or treat. I think it's fun, and it makes sense for families. Of course, it sucks when you're raising kids and want to give them the Halloween experience you had. But, it's not the end of the world. The kids still have a ton of fun, that's all that matters to me.",

And we'd happily give them candy.\n\nIt's not that anymore - nobody in my neighbourhood lets their kids participate, though we did send our toddler to childcare in a cute costume.",

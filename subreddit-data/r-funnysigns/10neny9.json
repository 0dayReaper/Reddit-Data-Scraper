Most of the time it's delivery drivers looking for anyone to sign for a package. They will wander all the way into the back corner and interrupt me welding but they won't go into the office that has a sign on the door that says SHIPPING.",

Gotta be trained and badged just to get past the front gate. But even at our home shop, we've given directions to delivery personnel to either come to the front, or to call us if they're delivering something larger. But, we usually get our deliveries from the same people, which makes that easier.  \n\nLike I said though, I don't disagree. If nothing else, the signage should indicate some common hazard words, or just a \"Keep the fuck out of this area or you're gonna be fucked\" indication.",

A paper mask works somewhat, if you really want to be safe you could get an air fed hood like I have, but I have about 4k into my setup with needing a 200 filter every 6-12 months. There are cheaper papr hoods that are battery operated that would work great, but they are about 600 for a cheap one. I have both the papr is fine in the winter because I'm not dragging an air line around, but my air fed is air conditioner as well. A cheaper idea is a 3m half mask, but those should be fit tested yearly. It's not really that bad until you start welding stainless, galvanized or painted surfaces. For those I usually grab the stick and run a fan blowing the fumes away or outside with a little breeze.",

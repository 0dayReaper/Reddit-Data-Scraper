Left-field question, I know. No need to answer if you don't want to, but at least from my own perspective, I bet it must be great! But at the same time, I imagine it could get old after awhile and you just take it for what it is.",

You just have it marginally better it seems, but as a straight guy myself (last I checked), I just take my body for what it is, no more, no less.

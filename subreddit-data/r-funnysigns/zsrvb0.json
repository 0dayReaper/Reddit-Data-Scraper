We're not talking about a PADI/SSI specialty course. It involves literally finding your way out of a cave with your SCUBA mask blacked out after being rolled around in order to disorient you. It is very serious business.",

Soon the water behind you is completely opaque, and you don\u2019t even know it. By the time you notice, it\u2019s too late. In a cave only a few meters deep, it\u2019s still absolutely possible to get disoriented, lost, unable to find top or bottom.

They\u2019d even brought a doctor on-site to help determine the best course of action because being upside down for a prolonged period of time is lethal, as clearly demonstrated in this case.\n\nFrom what I remember, they\u2019ve finally closed to the cave, but not after years of warnings to do so because of just how dangerous that cave is.\n\nShitty source, but here\u2019s a link to the story that I found after a hasty Google search: [here](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/weird-news/the-worst-death-imaginable-spelunker-22880796?int_source=amp_continue_reading&amp;int_medium=amp&amp;int_campaign=continue_reading_button#amp-readmore-target)\n\nEDIT: \n\nWhen I think of this tragedy every so often, I imagine his body being found thousands of years from now, not unlike how we find Neanderthals and the like nowadays, and when this guy\u2019s body is discovered, I imagine future humans theorizing about his death, it possibly being a religious sacrifice or a murder or a sacred burial or something.  That\u2019s assuming we survive as a species, of course.  :)",

He exhaled to squeeze a bit further and it was a done deal when he inhaled. They couldn't rescue him without breaking his legs. If they did that the rescuers speculated he'd go into shock and pass out. Then they'd have to pull him through the cave unconscious.  But it was too difficult to do with just yourself. Impossible with an unconscious body you need to pull a long.",

You should always know where the line is - but that\u2019s where training comes in. One drill while training involves having a blackout mask put on, being disoriented away from the line, then finding your way back to the line, blindfolded, and find your way towards the exit. \n\nBut things like that are why the sign says not to do it without training and equipment. There\u2019s a lot more to it than that in terms of proper training and planning, but I share it more to highlight why training is necessary to properly execute a cave dive.",

You need an iron stomach.  \n\n\nOriginally, I became a rescue diver for selfish reasons. I wanted to learn the skills needed to save myself (knowing what to do, what not to do, how to avoid dangerous scenarios, etc). I have ALWAYS had a fascination with caves and caverns, above and below water. I recognized early on how dangerous they really are and how quickly life and death are split like a pea. Underwater is quicker. Because, well, we can't breathe water. It is an agonizing and painful death to drown while panicked.  \n\n\nIn rescue diving, and some recreational diving circles, redundancy is taught can save your life. But not always. The worst part about some of these cave drownings, the evidence shows they died most likely because their flashlight went dark. Without a backup light, and not being properly prepared for cave or cavern exploration, absolute darkness is terrifying, and run out of air simply because they couldn't see or feel their way out quick enough.  \n\n\nI don't do rescue dives anymore. Mostly due to changing health reasons.",

Cave divers who have studied maps and are aware of the conditions can proceed, but everyone else needs to go back.   \n\nAt a certain depth, you need an equipment called a rebreather and a special mix of air to go further.  This causes nitrogen to build up in your blood.  as you leave the cave, you need to make long stops to give your blood time to decompress so the oxygen can safely leave.  These stops can take many, many long hours.  If you go down without the rebreather and the nitrox, first, you get all goofy heady and then you die.  \n\nIf you spent time down in scuba gear and your blood started to compress, you wouldn't have enough time to decompress on your regular air and you can die of the bends, when the nitrogen separates too quickly in the blood and forms large bubbles.  \n\nBesides problems with the air, some caves are just too dangerous.

I don't care if they were trying to show how important it is to not play around during an experiment, no school worth their salt would have anything as dangerous as nitroglycerin available for the students to interact with!\n\nThis silly rant brought to you by someone who is bored.",

Not nearly as dangerous, but they definitely had us making little explosives. We'd dry it out on some filter paper and set it off in the hood by tapping it with a yard stick. Part of the test was to see if you'd properly dried it because it wouldn't go off if it was too wet.\n\nWe were also using aqua regia a month into the class. I remember at least one kid accidentally spraying himself in the face because he wasn't venting his volumetric flask while mixing a dilution. Thankfully it was the most dilute solution we were making but that was the first time I saw the eye wash used in a real situation.",

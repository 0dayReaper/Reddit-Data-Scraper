I remember once buying solid soap and solid shampoo bars to use in the shower as I was trying to cut down on my plastic usage only for her to give it to me from both barrels, as to how the solid soap would send her vaginal and cervical pH out of whack. She had a look of abject disgust and loathing on her face as she lectured me for like 20 minutes about the acidity of her cervix and how I needed to be more considerate with my cosmetics purchases. We lived separately, were in a long-distance relationship, and had been seeing each other for a couple of months at the time. Fun times.",

Oh hold on thay just used water.\"\n\n I'm a girl however and I had many conversations like this in university when girls were freeked out that I just had two bars of soap and a bottle of conditioner in my shower basket. (I used shampoo bars before they were popular, it was JR Ligget, or lush, then a soap company by me stared messing with bars and gave me free ones to try.) They were shocked when I said my Doctor said just use water on your lady garden.",

Unfortunately, being the conflict avoidant soul that I am, I am not good at winning arguments at the best of times, and turns even less so when the topic of said argument is the effective hygiene and acidity regulation of a set of organs I don't possess. That's a guaranteed L right there.",

There was very clearly something wrong with him. Personally I'd mostly avoid him because I found him really weird and kinda scary. I never heard him say a word but just noises, his posture was that of a goblin and his teeth were fully absent.  \n\n\nWhen I was around 10 years old we would go swimming at our public pool a LOT, because my mom worked there and we could get in for free, free food, free everything, it was a great time.  \nMore often than not Hans would also be there, on his own and he'd bring his own ball to play with. He'd have fun and most other boys around my age would play along, including some of my friends. Afterwards he'd take his ball and chill in the bubble corner for a bit.  \n\n\nAnyway, years later my mom told me all about Hans, because we were curious to hear what happened to him. Does he still visit the pool? What was wrong with him? Did he die?  \nHe is alive, but he doesn't visit the pool no more, because he's banned.\n\nTurns out after playing with the younger boys he'd sit in the bubble corner to wank.   \nHe got told off many times, and one time even threatened one of my mom's colleagues (who are all women btw)  \n\n\nAnd not to excuse or downplay Hans' criminal perversions, but there was obviously something very wrong with him. To think there's people that should be totally fine pulling basically the same shit because it's like kinky to them is so weird to me. Like that's pretty fucking sad.",

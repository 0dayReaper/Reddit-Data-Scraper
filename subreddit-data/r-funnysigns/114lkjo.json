Even before I believed in Jesus I always believed in God cause I observe nature and could feel it in my heart and knew without God life would be pointless and I knew none of this could be made from nothing, it's just too perfect. Earth is perfect. Humans without God in their hearts are the only downside of life, the only source of evil. Eventually after I finally sat down and read the whole Bible, especially the words of Jesus..Jesus revealed himself to me by letting me feel his presence..2am I was sober and I began laughing in joy and feeling peace, feeling so good I started crying and felt better than any drugs I've ever done. Bible says if YOU draw close to God, GOD will draw close to you. It's true. Now over the last 2-3 years I've had countless prayers answered. A couple would blow your mind as it did mine. Jesus works in my life on the daily. The DAILY. Bro..open your heart to Jesus. Verbally say you renounce Satan and any wicked attachments you made knowingly or unknowingly and that you accept Jesus into your heart as your Lord and savior. Then believe what you said and watch God work. Bible says that God is at the door of your heart knocking and whoever shall open the door and let Him in, He will come sit and have a meal with you and conversate as friends. Reach out. Allow Him to show you He's real. What do you got to lose brother? I could not survive life without God. Up until 4 years ago I used drugs constantly to stay stable. I was a good man but sobriety wasn't an option. Now it's easy and natural. Come to the Lord all you who are heavy laden and He will give you rest..for His yoke is light and easy. Trust your Father my friend. Sorry for the long post I just want you to experience what I have. Jesus is King. Amen.",

His son died painfully on the cross after being mocked, beaten and spit on. All so you don't have to go to Hell. Is that not love? God is absolutely perfect, holy and righteous. Lucifer/Satan is the cause of every evil on Earth. All of it. He comes to steal kill and destroy. God has never sinned in any way shape or form. God is perfect and full of enduring love and faithfulness. You are greatly deceived. If you die without accepting the blood of Jesus you will go straight to Hell no matter how good you think you are. Humans are sinful creatures even at our best. God knew that and that's why he sent Jesus as our only hope, for He SO loved the world. Jesus paid the price willingly. He took our place. Jesus died for YOU. Satan wants you to die in sin and join him in Hell on judgement day. Don't get that twisted. Don't be quoting the Bible out of ignorance either it makes you look like a fool. Read the whole thing front to back with an open heart and you'll see the truth. Anyone can nitpick anything and twist meanings to their agenda. Jesus is the way, the truth and the life and no one can enter the kingdom of God except through him. And I never said you were addicted I said I was. Jesus breaks whatever chains anyone has. Lucifer just adds more chains to you. Don't be a fool and be a disciple of lucifer. He's so weak. Jesus is King and Lord of all. When he comes back to Earth to take what is His, Satan the \"strong man\" will be tied up and tossed into Hell. He has no real power. Jesus holds all authority over Heaven and Earth. Amen.",

Jesus' blood is what cleanses us and makes us pure in his eyes. He's a righteous judge who can't just excuse sin. Heaven is Holy, you must be cleansed to enter. Believing in what Jesus did for you and accepting his free gift is all that's required. He made it simple. And he gives everyone a fair chance. If people choose to go against Him and live in sin, he has no choice but send them to Hell. He is patient and merciful and leaves the 99 sheep to find the one lost. He won't give up on His children..he made each one of us in the womb and deeply loves us. Those who go to Hell, send themselves to Hell.",

What about people will go to hell for things they can\u2019t control like being born in the wrong body, being attracted to the same sex, then cant control that, but no it\u2019s their fault their going to hell right? No sex before, but what if a woman raped going to hell, but the man is fine because he couldn\u2019t control himself. A woman gets an abortion she\u2019s going to hell right except that god gives specific instructions how to give an abortion in \u201cthe hood book\u201d",

Forgiveness is freely given. The ones going to Hell will be those with hard hearts and those who won't forgive others and those who choose evil over and over no matter what. God knows each of our hearts. He will judge accordingly. I'd just advise to get to know Jesus. I never thought He was real until He revealed Himself to me and then began answering my prayers daily and helping me through every situation. Jesus is our mediator between God. He pleads our case and has authority to forgive sins. God wishes that not one single person perish..the reason Jesus hasn't returned yet is because God is patient and giving everyone the chance to repent and turn to Him. He loves you and everyone else. Sin leads to death and Jesus leads to life. He wants us to experience joy in full. Alot of people have a twisted image of God because of Satan's deceptions. Surrendering your life to the Lord is the best thing anyone can do. The Lord's plan for your life is infinitely better than anything any human could plan for their own life. He made each one of us in the womb and will provide for His children just like he provides for all wildlife. We are much more valuable than they are in His eyes. But many people refuse to give God a chance. He won't force himself upon you. He gave us free will. Once you let him in you'll see his miracles. There's a reason there's still Jesus followers..because they experience his truth. (Not the fakes that claim to be Christian for the wrong reasons though). God bless you in Jesus name. May His peace be with you.",

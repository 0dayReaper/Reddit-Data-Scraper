All I'm saying is that some other products like patches contain similar stuff that can actually cause harm when taken with too much of a combination medicine. That's exactly why most doctors don't recommend them.  Plus on top of that, if you're cheap like me then it's just less money to buy the off brand of Tylenol and ibuprofen and take both. The only reason I suggest mydol for periods is because it helps more than taking both of those. Just suggestions not arguments \ud83e\udd23",

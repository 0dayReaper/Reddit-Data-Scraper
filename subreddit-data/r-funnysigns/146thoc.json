Forcing a vegan to eat meat though does not include that person respected diet so it is far more disrespectful. Why would a meat eater splatter paint in a restraunt serving what half of their food already is? \n\nAnd anyways like the above is harmless . Damaging property would be more harmful ish so that could have a bigger reaction. But not huge. It\u2019s very rare extreme harm is done in vegan protest. Most try to do education or piecful protest. Atleast from those whom I\u2019ve met",

Friend of mine runs an outlet and he tells me that these repair services arent exactly easy nor cheap, since it can only be done during off working hours, which means someone's getting overtime pay, and more often than not each break down requires multiple attempts and visits to get fixed, and its actually a \"routine\" maintenance thing. Once every couple weeks to clean the machines, and every time they clean it, it breaks down again because the cleaner fucked up. So what happens is they just let the routine maintenance run its course. If the reassembly post cleaning is done right, they get a working machine until the next maintenance. If not, then fuck it. The odds of that happening is literally one in hundreds. This explains why the machines are always broken down. Its an issue of terrible design and not enough technicians to get them working.",

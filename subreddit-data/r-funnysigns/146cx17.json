I'm not a bigot and I am a native-born English speaker/reader. \n\nand you know, of course, that Shakespeare didn't even know how to spell his own name, right? things were in such a flux during his time that he wrote his name several different ways. it wasn't until later that things were standardized. spelling and grammar both. \n\nI think it's hilarious to be called a bigot by someone who refuses to respect MY beliefs while demanding that I respect theirs!\n\nActually, in formal writing, I have championed the singular 'them', though more for the feminists than anyone else. which is why I mentioned I'm a feminist, I just don't agree with everything they espouse; especially since they've changed their claims. I'm old enough to remember the original aim of feminism: to allow women to work IF they wanted to. NOT to demand that ALL women have to work.\n\nBTW, that one link is correct: gender neutral pronouns aren't new, that's what It is for. if someone wants to replace It, the talking heads should create a new one for us to use. not just demand that we bow down to their beliefs that go right against MY beliefs!",

The owner isn\u2019t honest about the breed and she\u2019s had to go to court twice for her dogs (off leash, dog fights, jumped on a person). I don\u2019t trust her dog around my chi unleashed, as with most big dogs. That is part because my little guy thinks he is a big dog (little dog syndrome). \n\nI\u2019ve met some great pits and been attacked by a German shepherd. I think training has a lot to do with it, but also being aware that a large dog is bred for certain purposes. Chihuahuas are rat-terriers, they can be little terrors, but as a group, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re that bad because their potential to actually hurt a person is so much less. Big difference. Do I like pit bulls? Personally no. Are they all bad? No. Would I ever own one? Nope. Not my type.",

Rottweilers are 77-130 pound dogs with a bite force of 328 PSI.\n\nSure, the number of aggressive chihuahuas may be higher, but chihuahuas can generally be easily shaken off due to their small size and are highly unlikely to cause significant damage to the muscles and bone. Pitbulls and rottweilers are both physically large, strong dogs so it's close to impossible to get away from them if they want to hurt you and due to their strong bite force and wide jaws, they can cause significantly more damage. Both pitbulls and rottweilers have strong enough jaw strength to break human bones. While chihuahuas have only been responsible for the deaths of 2 people, pitbulls have been responsible for the deaths of 284 people between 2005 and 2017, rottweilers for the deaths of 45 people.",

They\u2019re better suited to folks who are retired or who work from home and can spend lots of time with them.

She advised always putting up \"Be Advised: Dog on Premise\" signs, which I have done.",

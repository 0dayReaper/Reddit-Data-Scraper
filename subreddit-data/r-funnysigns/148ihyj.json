            "comment": "Crazy Woman Canyon runs along Wyoming 33, known as Crazy Woman Canyon Road. The Canyon is named for the Crazy Woman Creek, and there are several legends about how it got the name. The most known legend is the story of the Morgan family. The family was traveling via covered wagon when they were attacked by Sioux warriors. Three children and their father were killed, but Mrs. Morgan survived the attack. After witnessing these horrors, she lost her mind. She stole an axe from a warrior and attacked, killing four as the Sioux fled.\n\nSoon after, a mountain man named Johnson came upon the bloody scene. He buried the husband and children, and tried to get Mrs. Morgan to leave. She refused, and he built her a small cabin. Eventually, he found her frozen body, dead from starvation. Locals knew about her presence near the stream, and dubbed it Crazy Woman Creek. \n\n[https://www.onlyinyourstate.com/wyoming/crazy-woman-canyon-wy/](https://www.onlyinyourstate.com/wyoming/crazy-woman-canyon-wy/)",

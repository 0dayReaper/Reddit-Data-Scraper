Women can and do rape men and molest children, and it often goes unreported or isn't taken seriously. \n\nBut men do it *a lot* more.

So it covers both genders. Seems to me they don't want creeps sitting at the park leering at children with impunity and being able to say, \"iTs nOt AgAiNsT tHe RuLeS!\" This gives them some power to enforce the rules against problem adults. I guarantee you no one is there policing this policy, it's there in case a problem arises.",

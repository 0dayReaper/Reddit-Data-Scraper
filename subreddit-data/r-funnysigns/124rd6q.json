Nieces don\u2019t count unless their parents died and you now have full custody of them and responsibility for them. It\u2019s like saying \u2018I had siblings!\u2019 And using that to substantiate your claim that you KNOW what being a parent is because you once watched someone parent. Here\u2019s the newsflash: EVERY KID IS DIFFERENT. One kid mastering a skill does not equate to all children mastering the same skill at the same time. My kid could do a full barbecue by herself from laying the fire to serving the steaks according to everyone\u2019s preferences and making the sides by herself at age 8. Should I now expect all 8 year olds to do that? I could shoot, track and successfully hunt by myself by age 5 including skinning my kill and bringing it home. Does that mean every 5 year old can do the same? Can I drop your 6 year old niece in the woods with a fun and expect her to find her way home and bring meat for dinner with her? She\u2019s a whole year older than I was.",

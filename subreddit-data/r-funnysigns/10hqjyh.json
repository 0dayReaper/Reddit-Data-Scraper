The meaning of a word or name is derived from popular usage (mainstream descriptive linguistics).

If you try to debate this citing historical reasons or whatever, that\u2019s an etymological fallacy. \n\nAlso, the way continents are split is regional and based on education system. Did you know that some systems combine Europe and Asia? The US, as most of the world, teaches that North America is a single continent, and South America is another single continent.\n\nThe school systems that combine them into one unified \u201cAmerica\u201d are in the minority and are limited to Latin language countries, like Mexico or France. Even the French officially refer to Americans (US citizens) as \u201cles americains\u201d.",

It\u2019s used as an abbreviation because in the US North America and South America are considered separate continents, so if you meant the continent you\u2019d say North America, so there is no confusion. It\u2019s far from the only country that is commonly shortened from its official name. Also in some languages America is literally the actual name of the country. \n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is, everyone knows what they meant and being extremely pedantic doesn\u2019t make you look smart, it\u2019s just annoying.",

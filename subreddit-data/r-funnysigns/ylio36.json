It's just a strip of leather cut to length with a pocket. And the ammunition was basically everywhere - just find rocks about the right size... even if you wanted to bake up a bunch of clay sling bullets (like the Romans did), it's faster and easier to mass produce them than it is to fletch arrows at that scale.\n\nThere was a reason shepherds used them - simple to make, simple to use, easy get ammunition. Like with longbows, it takes a fair bit of time and practice to get accurate with it, but they didn't have reddit back then, so...",

There was a study on some sling bullets they found at a Roman fort in Britain that suggested they could impart as much energy/do as much damage as a .44 magnum. Don't underestimate the value of angular momentum...\n\nIt might not pierce a steel breastplate, but it could smash bone and crush skulls in an enemy force with anything short of metal armor/helmets. And given a skilled slinger can match the rate of fire on a skilled archer...\n\nThere's a good reason they were a mainstay of armies and peasants alike for thousands of years.",

I happily gave away tons of snap peas and peppers and tomatoes. I loved the idea that in an area where most people had crippling heroin addictions and were stealing and squatting because of their addiction that there was a little group of unhoused hippies hanging out eating the veggies I grew. I would've grown a whole garden just for them given the opportunity. I tried to get them to come around more for proper food since the soup kitchen didn't operated daily, but never had any luck.",

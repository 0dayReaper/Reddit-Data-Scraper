It's basically the best in the world in one way, but if you're poor or without insurance, you'll go broke if you have a serious issue and need to stay 1 or more nights in the hospital. But you will still get the care and the meds pretty quickly if it's the ER or a small clinic visit. \n\nIf I need to just go to a clinic for stitches or something, it's less than 200 dollars. People will say \"but in other countries it's 0 money but maybe parking for 10 equivalent dollars!\" but also I don't have to pay a large percent on my income in taxes for healthcare and way better wait time. But also on the cons of American heslthcare, if I have a big health issue like cancer or something, if I don't have insurance, I'm fucked financially but I will still get care without wait for something small, or if I take out a loan. There's pros and cons to both privatized and socialized healthcare systems. I wish we could combine the pros of both and have some kind of public option or something.\n\nPeople shouldn't have to suffer wait time or financial ruin because they get sick or hurt. It's fucked up. But I guess it's better than living in pre 20th century where we had basically nothing. We'll eventually figure it out, but unfortunately it's going to take time, like progress always does. We just gotta keep pressuring those in power to make the right decisions",

As flawed as your medical insurance is, we still get far more for our healthcare tax dollar than Americans do. You *should* be upset.",

EMTALA does not cover chronic illnesses, just emergent care.\n\nTwo quick things:\n\n1. There was a delay to getting my cancer treatment because the insurance company would cover the treatment, but not the necessary imaging to undergo such treatment. The insurance wrangler on my care team (because I had to have an insurance wrangler) said this is SOP, and that they consistently reject the imaging the first go around.\n\n2. There are *definitely* waits for non-emergent care. It's constantly a struggle to find a PCP with openings who takes my insurance. Endocrinologists I've heard can be quite difficult to get into. A very specific specialist on an emergency basis?  Sure. But that's only because others who need the same care aren't able to get treatment because they don't have appropriate insurance. There's no pro in someone else suffering so that i can get in a week or two earlier.",

By that do you mean you can get great coverage as long as you can afford it? That seems like a weird contradiction to say, seems to me like the best in the world would mean people get it by default..\n\nIf you have something big like cancer you're basically fucked? You'd need to get a loan to pay it off while having to work with cancer and going through chemo to pay that loan off? Better hope you're not in an at will state and your employer doesn't shit can you...\n\nYou think a large part of your taxes in other countries go towards healthcare? Dude, you live in the states, they tax you out the ass here on everything, property taxes twice a year-simply for the privilege of owning things you buy with your own earned money that you've already been income taxed on, all prices plus taxes, mystery taxes, sales taxes, hell, in Vegas they charge entertainment taxes on buying tickets to see a show! made up taxes etc, got to fund that military budget somehow. Other countries don't have that. They just have income tax. Where I'm from the income tax is lower than what I'm paying in the states and we have socialised healthcare.\n\nI'm still waiting for the cons on socialized healthcare....\n\nTo be frank, I'd rather have socialised healthcare no matter how shit people who have never had it think it is and know what I'm entitled to than have made up prices and copays for things, insurance different from one employer than another depending on how much they like you therefore choose to spend on coverage for you, this shitty coverage AFTER having already paid out the ass for it on every pay check.\n\nSo many people are still trying to convince themselves the system here is the good. It just isn't. Accept it.",

Plenty of people in the US have to wait 6 months or more for a non emergency doctor visit or scheduled surgery and fight for months with the insurance to get it even partly covered. Trust me, it is also a huge cut off my paycheck. If there's not enough doctors damnit, train more freaking doctors! I never see anyone debate that. It can actually be encouraged. If there's truly less wait times in the US it's just because less people get to go to the doctor at all.",

You can end up owing tens of thousands out of pocket even after insurance has put in it's \"fair share\", according to insurance. Or you run the risk of insurance coming back and claiming that your life-saving procedure wasn't medically necessary. And guess what? You're already paying a huge chunk of your taxed income to medical programs. You just don't get to benefit from it. 8% of the US GDP goes into public medical insurance. [https://www.commonwealthfund.org/international-health-policy-center/countries/united-states](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/international-health-policy-center/countries/united-states)   \n\n\nEven more interesting is this direct quote\n\n&gt;The United States ranks last overall, despite spending far more of its gross domestic product on health care. The U.S. ranks last on access to care, administrative efficiency, equity, and health care outcomes, but second on measures of care process.\n\n[https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2021/aug/mirror-mirror-2021-reflecting-poorly](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2021/aug/mirror-mirror-2021-reflecting-poorly)   \n\n\nI get that you're not going \"Rah Rah America #1!\" in your post but even your muted, tempered support lacks some accuracies to it.  \n\n\nFrom a pure economics point of view insurance is a middleman that serves absolutely no purpose. They make money by limiting access and care to end users as much as possible. The entire sector is the equivalent of digging holes to fill in the holes other people dug in a giant circle as far as productivity is concerned.",

If Dickens were alive today, he'd be sad to see the things he wrote his tale to speak out against are worshipped as the epitome of life by so many in today's world. Surely he'd have concluded we would be well beyond such classism by now.",

He'd probably be excited to see that there has been progress made. And would continue to advocate for more progress.\n\nLets not forget what Obama admin did for US healthcare when they pushed the ACA through, and continued to push for more after they got what they could passed through congress. The Biden admin has also pushed for more and gotten more where they can, including VA care.\n\nMy husband and I both benefitted from government subsidized healthcare. Me getting tricare from being in the Navy and him getting insured thru the ACA. He's passed now, but he wouldn't have been able to afford any of the care he received while he had cancer if not applying and accepted for ACA insurance with the Marketplace",

I had two surgeries this year including one that required 6 months of weekly physical therapy and my total out-of-pocket costs were $1200 along with $4300 for the premium (which wound up being paid through work by a fellowship I earned). It all depends on your insurance.\n\nThe disadvantage of a system like the one we have in the US is that everyone tries to cheap out. Almost everyone who complains about massive surprise bills or crazy deductibles at one point sat down in front of several insurance plans and chose the cheapest one. If I had chosen the $3200 plan I would have paid around $7000, but I took the 15 seconds necessary to realize that 20% co-insurance on outpatient surgeries and hospital stays was a really shit deal, and for just $1100 more I could get a flat rate of $100 in the ER and $200 for surgery or a hospital stay.\n\nNot saying there isn't tons of room for improvement, but let's not pretend that healthy people and a large swath of the middle class doesn't ultimately make out better. People don't even notice when they're saving thousands and thousands on taxes and low premiums, but they notice when suddenly they have costs that offset those savings somewhat.",

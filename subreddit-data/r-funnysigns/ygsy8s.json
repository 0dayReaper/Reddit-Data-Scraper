The host family decided on a car trip to Berlin.\n\nShe had a particular medical issue where she would need to urinate much more frequently than normal.\n\nSigns along the highway to Berlin were of the \"do not stop\" variety.\n\nShe needed to desperately urinate. The only alternative was to pee in the car, and they weren't prepared for that. So they pulled over to the side, she got out and took care of business.\n\nThey managed to complete their journey without intervention from the authorities. \n\nStill amazes me that they didn't have any run-ins.",

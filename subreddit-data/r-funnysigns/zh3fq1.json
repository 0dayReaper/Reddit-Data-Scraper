I had to explain to her that bc she still had her organs she could still get pregnant, especially bc she's so fertile.\n\nShe treats me like her therapist sometimes and I asked where the baby had gone the pregnancy before said second sister was born so she explained her miscarriage/pregnancy history to me. Apparently she's been pregnant at least 8 times, carried four of us to term, had a few other miscarriages, and terminated one (she got pregnant before me and wasn't ready to raise a kid).\n\nI don't understand why she doesn't get that BC isn't 100% effective, but hopefully she'll understand before she gets pregnant again (she's got a new bf and regularly talks to me about pregnancy scares with him bc she thinks getting her tubes tied and having an implant will 100% protect them).",

And then they have children and then take care of those children homeless and the cycle feeds on itself with no progression made.\nIts probably not true for everyone. But i happen to pass by a frail woman with two young boys and pushing a baby stroller. From a distance from behind i couldnt tell if she was young or old she even had her back hunched as i passed by and when i got a look at her face it was completely dolled up wasnt even bad her face was pretty she was a young woman probably homeless or poor as dirt dragging her kids along who were probably from prostitution. The kids seemed fairly happy at least by a glance but it just opened my eyes to a whole other problem.\nThe thing is most poor people cant afford internet connection but even if they do i dont think many would beproud or brave enough to speak up and add to the stigma of abortion and having children. Afterall its such a violent scene online people get fucking crazy about it on both sides. I dont think many poor homeless women would be interested interacting online in that way. If anything theyre probably more worried about paying bills and staying in contact with work or possibly drugs and so on. \nWe really ought to open our minds and broaden the scope of who we represent with our voices and remember its not just about us but also those who dont have a voice.\nThat being said it should be obvious by now i fall in between both arguements im for and against it.",

Just yet another gear rotating within the clockwork of the steel refinery of Life. My disappearance or death from the surface of this pitiful planet will cause no effect or remembrance.\n\nI simply stated the most ridiculous and ludicrous statement that I could. A statement that is obviously retarded and one that no sane person would actually try it.

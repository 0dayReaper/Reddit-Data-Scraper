It could cost you a lot of money, not to mention your safety and other people's when that thing fails. And it totally will fail if it is doing what you are saying it is. Also it may be a simple fix now and a really really expensive fix later.\n\nDoes the car have the factory jack? If you can find a totally flat spot, and chock the tires so that the car doesn't want to fall off the jack, look in the owner's manual or online for where to place the jack for your model vehicle, and get it up in the air and take a picture of all of the pieces between the inside of your wheel and your transaction on the engine side, and post that to mechanic advice on reddit, they may very well be able to tell you exactly what it is. Tie rod, upper control arm etc...  So that when you go to a shop, you have a pretty good idea if they are being honest with you.\n\nEdit: do not put your body under the car while it is up on that jack. Those little scissor jacks are definitely not very stable. If the car falls, you should not be somewhere underneath it where it can land on you.",

At one point a friend needed me to take her mid 80s Toyota pickup with a canopy on the back to get worked on or something for some reason I can't remember. Getting on the freeway in downtown Spokane washington, I literally tacked up every gear, from first until I was forced to merge onto the freeway still doing about 13 mph under the limit. Literally that little Toyota that could, couldn't. That was one of many steps along my way to realizing that a little bit of patience goes a long ways.  Sometimes people are inept. Sometimes people are doing the best they can. And we don't always know which is which",

That's simply not biologically true.\n\nThe new flu viruses come from Asia for a reason- in Asia there is a particular mix of species that leads to new human viruses.\n\nThey farm fish in ponds where they also raise ducks. Ducks are loaded with tens of thousands of bird viruses that can jump to pigs.\n\nUnfortunately, they raise pigs right next to ducks. The bird viruses jump to pigs and mutate like crazy.\n\nPigs are similar to humans, enough so that viruses that mutate in pigs eventually become viable in humans, and these new viruses make the leap to humans.\n\nScientists comb through Asian farms all year to try to ascertain which new viruses exist and which are the most prominentNm, and they cone up with that year's flu shot by combining the most likely culprits in a multi-virus vaccine based on that year's new strains, which is how we get put flu shots every year.\n\nSide note: they grow these viruses in eggs, then take them out and kill them for the flu shot. \n\nWe don't get diseases from dogs. Rabies is controlled rigorously in the US. \n\nKids who are raised with dogs have healthier immune systems than kids who grow up with no pets. \n\nSource: I'm a biologist",

He plays an instrument (saxophone maybe) in a band and was on tour when i met him at a local bar.\n\nHe's a genuinely cool/nice dude. I think he was just trying to go viral somehow. When the hat thing kicked off, i for sure thought that was his moment.\n\nEdit:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m1jlu7jjvo5b1.png?width=830&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=524d1af80416b4bc74fb5acab8eecbb156ef9a84",

They looked at all kinds of organizations, not just churches, but churches came up again and again as places where abuse was enabled and covered up.\n\nAnd what struck me as I read was that it was a [consistent set of Biblical principles](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/uwrgq1/how_paul_created_the_perfect_environment_for/) which were used in churches that resulted in high rates of abuse.  It wasn't just a few bad individuals.  It's a systemic thing following from what many churches teach which enabled and supported those abusive individuals: Respect authority, especially male authority; resolve your disputes inside the church instead of going to court; forgive others, focus on your sin instead of theirs; be sexually \"pure\".\n\nIf you're in a church where these ideas are taught - and they're all Biblical ideas! - the likelihood that your church will not only produce abusers *but also support the abuser instead of the victim* goes up dramatically.\n\nIt happens depressingly often because it's a result of the beliefs, not just a few bad people.\n\nEDIT: I don't think that the founders of Christianity wanted this to happen.  They didn't put these principles in place in order to cause abuse.  But abuse keeps being enabled and covered up as a result of these beliefs.  It's like an engineer has a way of designing bridges which makes a disturbing number of them fall down.  At some point you have to look at the engineer's beliefs about physics and identify what's wrong with them in order to prevent more bad bridges from being built.",

Seems curious to me that all these mega-church pastors and televangelists have massive mansions and several private jets and yachts. I bet that has nothing to do with these churches being massive money laundering schemes hidden behind the opaque laws protecting church finances. Absolutely nothing to do with that at all in the slightest, I'm sure.\n\nAt least the state is legally obligated to divulge expenditure, unlike the church.",

So from that standpoint I get it. But nowadays people marry and don't even have kids because they already have 2 or 6. So to me that's not a marriage, but a union. But if Christians are going to use it however they want, why can't everyone else?\n\nIt's funny some of the more extreme Christian cry about rights until it's something they don't like. But that's both extremes of the political spectrum unfortunately. I kinda miss when I was a kid growing up in the 90s. We didn't have this inherent division. Nobody (I knew) cared if someone was gay, Muslim, or whatever. Just as long as they weren't an asshole lol",

Seems curious to me that all these mega-church pastors and televangelists have massive mansions and several private jets and yachts. I bet that has nothing to do with these churches being massive money laundering schemes hidden behind opaque laws protecting church finances. Absolutely nothing to do with that at all in the slightest, I'm sure. Those churches definitely aren't profit based or driven.\n\nEDIT: to those of you who claim separation of state and church, you're fools to believe mega-churches don't also ~~bribe~~ lobby politicians to pass laws that fit both their ideological and financial agendas, and then conveniently hide behind these opaque church financing laws to cover it up.",

That's literally what it is. \n\nCalling a paprika a pepper is just unnecessarily confusing, because pepper is also what you call those small, black, spicy balls.

Therefore, to avoid confusion and unnecessary explanation, it just makes more sense to just call it a paprika and paprika powder.",

He walked away, I made the thing, moved on to another duty. He returned and stood there until I finished, argued (while I just responded in a confused manner) with me for a minute whilst confirming he had no idea what \"espresso\" or \"shots\" were before demanding to just fill the cup the rest of the way with drip coffee. I don't rag on anyone for not knowing all the lingo that Starbucks has vomited into the topic of \"coffee\" but if you don't know what a basic drink is just ask or directly describe what you want, man.

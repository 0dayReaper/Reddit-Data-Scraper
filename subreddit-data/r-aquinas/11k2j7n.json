    "postText": " I have an internship in Lowell and need somewhere to live from 5/6 to 8/19. I go to michigan tech and can pay rent upfront. I don't have pets, I do my dishes right away, and I don't have blanket views about groups of people, so I'm a pretty safe option. I lived in GVSU's secchia hall last summer, but they don't offer that unless you work through select companies now and it wasn't the best experience anyway. Nothing like 4th floor with no elevator and a train 10 feet from your window amiright?\n\nIdeally, I'm looking for something east of GR, but I'm open to whatever comes. Student or not, if you have something in the area, shoot me a message.",

    "postText": "I lived at GVSU's grand rapids apartments last summer for an internship but they're not offering that this summer. Is anyone looking for a roommate for a few months? 5/6-8/26. I'll only have a semester left for my masters after the summer, so if you're down I might even move back in December. I work in Lowell, so the farther east the better. I wouldn't even mind if it's east of Lowell really, as long as it's close.\n\nI have enough money to cover the whole summer, so that shouldn't be an issue. That said, I'm prioritizing cost more than I am space or amenities. I currently share a 400 square foot apartment in the UP, so as long as there's a bedroom for me and some place to make food I'm pretty much good.\n\nYou can comment or DM me if you're interested or have questions.",

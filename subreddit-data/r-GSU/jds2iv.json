Really convenient tool when its kinda hard to find a definite list on the internet.",

I tried absentee voting in 2018 for the midterms, but Kemp had so severely screwed up the process that I didn't receive my ballot until 2 days before the election, which means it didn't return in time to be counted. This election is too important to risk something like that happening.",

Studies have shown that these tests can be wrong up to 1/3 of the time. \nB: The cops didn\u2019t know how to use the tests. In the dashcam footage the cop says something along the lines of \u201cthe test is showing pink, that\u2019s positive for cocaine.\u201d All of the field tests I\u2019ve seen have a pink neutral color and turn blue for a positive but it may be different.\nC: The cops knew how the tests worked and just wanted a reason to take him to jail.\nI have a hard time believing that of the 6+ cops on scene not a single one of them thought \u201cthat\u2019s not coke.\u201d Bear in mind he was arrested for speeding before they even discovered the \u201cdrugs\u201d so it really seems that they wanted to take him to jail.",

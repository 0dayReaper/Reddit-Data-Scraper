Are they more difficult and accelerated, or about the same as a normal class in terms of the workload and difficulty?",

The difficulty is in the fact it's 16 weeks worth of material squished into nine weeks. \n\nI generally recommend them only for students who are self-driven, use a calendar to keep a strict schedule, and can keep themselves on track.",

If you're confident in your time management skills, and know you will have time for school every day (after any other obligations like work or whatever else), then it's basically the same as a regular semester, but the time is condensed. But if you have really bad time management, it might not be for you.",

I personally do better with online work, and since I'm only in 1-2 classes at the time, and not really doing much else in my life, they're pretty straightforward and easy if you make sure you remember do space out your work throughout the week and try and do a little bit each day if the class has a lot of work to do. Some classes you can do all the work that's due that week like the day before it's due, and it doesn't take long. Other classes might have more work to do that you will def need to spread out throughout the week. \n\nOne thing that helps me a lot is at the start of the week, or on sunday, writing out a checklist for the week and putting each day of the week and what I want to get done for each class that day. \n\nJust remember to check folio often, and/or to check in at the start of the week so you can keep in mind how much work has to get done that week. If you're just in school I think it can be pretty simple, and it's just like rather than having class/schoolwork only 3 days a week for one class, you now have it every day of the week. But I have definitely seen folks who have work or families taking up most of their week before even adding school into the mix struggling in my summer classes.",

    "postText": "I'm pretty sure I got a D in Mechanics of Materials (ENGR 3233), but I guess we'll see tomorrow lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the first D I might have gotten in my life. I plan on working way harder next time, but if I have to retake the course, I would prefer an easier professor (I had Shahnam Navaee).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWho would you recommend for MoM? I was thinking Rahman but not sure if he's teaching it next year. Thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I just got my grade back and it was a C. I know I can do better than that, but I'm happy I don't have to take the course over again. Thank you for the suggestions!",

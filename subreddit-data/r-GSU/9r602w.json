We averaged around 8,000 students per game in 2014-15. This season, we've topped 3,000 once. I totally sympathize with there being less support for a losing team over the last two seasons, but the team has done its part to turn things around. So go and do your part and drag a few extra people to the game tomorrow.",

Just to give a little anecdote, my dad was a 5'8 cornerback out of Covington LA way back when, they had the best team in the nation (literally), he returned a pick 6 in the state title game, and LSU didnt even look his way due to his height, yet hes the biggest LSU fan I now. Similar thing with UGA, those teams are almost part of the state culture.",

To me the most annoying thing is if you currently go to GSU and you wear UGA or any other big school apparel around campus. Like, buy some GSU clothing damn. Do you not realize that youre going to competing with UGA grads for jobs, and the money that you paid to buy those clothes is helping UGA stay on top, know what I mean? ",

Students I had classes with were getting 2 semesters worth of classes added on because of degree programs changing. Students that were originally Armstrong students were told they wouldn't have to take courses in Statesboro. After the merger, that turned out to be a complete lie. It's not fair to make students living in Savannah drive 2 hours out and back for courses. The merger has been a complete shit show.",

Since then, it's been alarming to see some of the consequences. Also, although the departments had lower budgets, when we were independent of GSU we actually had better funded programs. A large amount of our campus' funds went to some Statesboro construction project last year.",

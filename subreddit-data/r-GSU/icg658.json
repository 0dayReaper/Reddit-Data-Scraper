This document indicates that the writer is attempting to enforce policies without administrative backing. Without context of who the writer is we are not able to determine if they have the authority to make campus wide policies.\n\nIn my opinion, judging by the wording and  tone of voice I would guess that this individual does not. The \"gender studies professor\" thing is a common term used today to describe the most radical of the political left. One that watches an ample amount of fear mongering main stream media and regurgitates talking points into their surrounding. Taking your shoes off and leaving them outside so your pets can't catch COVID? Seriously? If the CDC isn't afraid about animal's impact then why would anyone be? Unless that's what the media told you to believe, but I digress. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs the Corona virus real and should be taken seriously? Yes\n\nIs the Corona virus being used as a political weapon? Yes",

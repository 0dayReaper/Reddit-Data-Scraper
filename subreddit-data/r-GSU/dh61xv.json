The coding isn't hard, most will give you a C if you're close. We study Java/C/C++ only. The way of teaching heavily varies on the professor. I had a professor once that was all about conversation and code practice during class, and you read the powerpoints on your own. The CS professors on the statesboro campus are great though.",

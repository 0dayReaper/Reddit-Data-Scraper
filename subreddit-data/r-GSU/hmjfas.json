Face covering use will be in addition to and is not a substitute for social distancing.\n\nFace coverings are not required in one\u2019s own dorm room or suite, when alone in an enclosed office or study room, or in campus outdoor settings where social distancing requirements are met.\n\nAnyone not using a face covering when required will be asked to wear one or must leave the area. Repeated refusal to comply with the requirement may result in discipline through the applicable conduct code for faculty, staff or students.\n\nReasonable accommodations may be made for those who are unable to wear a face covering for documented health reasons.",

I don\u2019t have insurance, and my partner\u2019s is inadequate. His mother has COPD. Kemp really fucked us by not allowing mayoral discretion in managing their own communities. I guess we\u2019ll fuck off and die now smh",

Most support staff members would have little if any work to do and the fiscally responsible thing to do would be layoffs but it would be difficult to staff and retrain all of those positions when students can return to campus. \n\nHow much are students willing to pay to attempt online classes? The USG ecore classes are 159 a credit hour, every university chargers much more for in seat instruction. \n\nThe best cast scenario for the university is they are able to provide safe campus living and in seat instruction. Personally I believe it\u2019s not possible, but if the university shuts down again I will also more than likely looking to unemployment as I\u2019m a university employee. \n\nThe university is being placed in the impossible situation of coming up with a plan that pleases everyone. \n\nLook at Harvard they announced that they are charging full price for online classes and faced harsh backlash.",

I'm food service and at work I'd say it's maybe 20% of customers wearing mask for pick up orders. Also one of my coworkers waited for a few days to mention his roommate was positive. The school reopening is going to be a shit show. Science denialism has become political and our campus is going to suffer from this sad state of affairs.",

So, if you don't return the boot they made self returnable to save employee time, they'll send an employee out to put another device on your car? How long you think before there's a pile of these tossed in the woods and this plan is scrapped?",

            "comment": "\"They can then return it\"\n\n\"It also saves university crews the time spent going to the car to unlock a boot\"\n\nYou mean the employees hired to do exactly this type of thing? Parking enforcement? It's not even the university police that do this (unless thats changed). Easiest way is to not allow students to register for the next semester or graduate unless their parking tickets are caught up and paid. Then they don't have to invest in the boots or 'barnacles' or waste employees time (lol) removing boots and devices.\n\nBe better, GSU.",

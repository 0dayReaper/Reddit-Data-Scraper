    "postText": "Hello everyone, I have been taking online classes with Georgia State for the last 2 years and I plan to transfer to another school in the spring semester. Sothern is one of the three schools that I have applied to but I don't know a lot about the school or student life in statesboro. I am also unsure if I am quite ready to move three and a half hours away from home (I live in Cobb County). But it is my understanding that southern is cheaper than most of the major state schools, so that is the main reason why I'm considering it. I would appreciate any and all advice and information about what to expect at southern. Finding a place to stay has also been a challenge because the school does not offer housing for transfer students. What is there to know about student life in statesboro? How diverse is the school? Why should I transfer here? These are the types of questions I'd like current and former students to answer. Thank you!\n\n(P.S. I currently work at publix and it is my understanding that they are building one in Statesboro. How far is it from campus?)",

Statesboro itself is shitty, but to live there is cheap as hell.(at least it was when i lived there 2016-2020).\n\nI had fun but it's easy to get caught up in the \"party school scene.\" I had buddies from State that would come down to party because of stories they've heard. Idk much about transferring in but Southern and Statesboro did me well. \n\n\nCould it have been better elsewhere? Maybe. Could it have been worse? Also maybe. Life is what you make it baby",

            "comment": "Hey!\n\nI graduated back in 2019 so things may be a bit different now, but probably not by much. \n\nHousing: Super cheap, and in some instances cheaper than on-campus dorms. All of the apartments nearby are within walking distance, with some having the school-ran busline at their locations. I didn't live off-campus, so it's worth getting some opinions on what's best.\n\nSchool Life: Phenomenal. If you like to party, Georgia Southern is great. If you like to live the academic life, Georgia Southern can also be great. For example, I was able to get very close and involved with faculty research at Southern given the close-knit environment. This helped me a ton with getting into a good graduate program elsewhere after I left. Also, the sports atmosphere is great if that's something you're into.\n\nDiversity: Very diverse. Georgia Southern is very representative of the population of the Savannah area, which is diverse. Lots of African American, Latino, and a smaller minority of Korean Americans.",

            "comment": "moved away from the boro earlier this summer (class of '21 but stuck around for the cheap rent), publix was in progress, all exterior walls up, so it may or may not be done by spring semester. it is right across the highway from the stadium, so a car is necessary to reach it (not that the highway stops people from crossing) though they might just throw a crosswalk down at that traffic light. it's not easy to entertain yourself in statesboro without a little money and some friends, just takes extra creativity. there is a comic book and board game shop downtown that i frequented, galactic. excellent selection of comics, graphic novels, and tabletop games of all sorts &amp; you could rent a board game to play in their back room for $5 and i think get $5 off if you end up buying a copy of that game. there's a place called the clubhouse with bowling, arcade, laser tag, mini golf, go karts. there's a little water park. they have a botanic garden that's free for students to visit. southern has a generally a nice-looking campus to walk around, though statesboro itself ain't much. it's flat, it's plain, and the drive across i-75 and (fcking hell) i-16 is mind numbing. perfect drive for a few podcast episodes.",

            "comment": "I also transferred to Southern from State my sophomore year. Graduated this spring. \n\nYou said you're doing online classes but since you live near ATL you probably still know the vibe State's campus has. Southern is quite different. First of all, there is actually a cohesive campus with green space and buildings closer to each other than State. The people are similar but in my experience there aren't as many hustlers on every sidewalk. Also, homelessness is far, far less frequent. \n\nNot only is rent cheaper, everything is. You don't pay for parking in the town, campus parking is like 1/3 of State's, etc. It's still the same college experience, probably more so. I would recommend it if you don't mind the humidity. The quality of the education is the same.\n\nAs for housing, the connection apartments are great in my experience. Some roommates can suck. It's cheap af. \n\nThe school is diverse for south Georgia but of course less so than what you would find in ATL. There are many students of color, and LGBTQ+ students have a presence there. \n\nIt's a great school all things considered.",

I'm sure it's changed quite a bit in the 11 years since I graduated, but it used to be dirt cheap and there was always some social even or party going on.  I thought the education I received there was excellent. Great professors, great students, great facilities.  I miss GSU a lot sometimes.",

            "comment": "Went to the ER yesterday due to a panic attack caused by financial and medical stress. I had no idea it was a panic attack at the time, I thought I was legitimately dying because mentally I felt relatively normal but physically I couldn't breath, felt lightheaded to the point I couldn't stand up or move much, and was admitted at a BP/HR of 180~/96. They gave me a benadryl drip which worked to calm me down enough so that they could test me for a physical problem. They found I was healthy minus the panic attack, and I was discharged with a generalized anxiety disorder diagnosis.\n\nReally terrifying that your body can do this to you despite feeling, for the most part, mentally sound. Stay healthy GSU and don't ignore what your body is telling you.",

When I lived at centennial I went to the chinese place (Orient Express is the name I think) in the parking lot across the street (near zaxby's) a lot. I hope they're still open.\n\nAnd I love lucky garden! I love that they're like a hybrid between buffet and takeout, you pay per dish so you can try a lot of stuff without breaking the bank or having to take home fried rice that gets dry and nasty in the fridge.",

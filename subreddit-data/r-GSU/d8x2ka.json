    "postText": "So this may be old news by now, but I got a sandwich from Market Street today for the first time this semester. They don\u2019t have the little panini presses anymore that make the sandwiches so delicious and crunchy. All they have now are the little conveyor belt toaster things that hardly toast the bread at all. It was like a completely different sandwich! I hope it\u2019s just temporary because those sandwiches used to be amazing.\n\nEdit: Can\u2019t spell sandwich.",

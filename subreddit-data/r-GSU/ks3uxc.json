    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nNot sure how many people on campus are planning on taking the FE, but I'm gonna take mine in May (mechanical) and it would be nice if I wasn't studying alone. If anyone is interested in perhaps meeting up with me to study (either in person or videocall) feel free to message me.\n\nIf you're not doing the one for mechanical, it's cool. All the exams test similar skills, they only differ a bit with each specific discipline.\n\nThanks!",

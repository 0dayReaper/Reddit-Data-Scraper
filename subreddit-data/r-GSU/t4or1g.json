Online lab is interesting it seems.\n\nI'm eyeing the PHSC 1211 and 1211L since I have no background in chemistry or biology as a non-science student.\n\nAny thoughts from the gallery?",

It\u2019s asynchronous. There is either one or two proctored exams that cost $15-30. And in some classes you\u2019ll have to pay for a lab kit that is around $100-200. Not every class with a lab will make you get a lab kit tho. Chem1211k and Phys 2211k don\u2019t. The geol 1121k lab kit is $67. Worth it if you want an easy A. Many students don\u2019t know about it bc colleges want you to take their classes instead.",

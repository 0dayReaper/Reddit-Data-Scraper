    "postText": "I applied to Georgia Southern for Spring 2022 as a transfer student. 60+ units completed, but I took my SAT a LONG time ago. \nOver 10 years ago.\nI scored an 1890 (back before the system changed) and filled that score in on this application.\n\nNow, I\u2019m concerned. Will my application be thrown out for my outdated SAT score? Should I log back in and delete it?",

You\u2019re not a first time in college student your SAT score doesn\u2019t matter that much since you\u2019re not factored into their graduation, matriculation, and retention numbers.",

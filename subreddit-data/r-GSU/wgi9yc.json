Multiple choice exam questions that are straight from the book/notes. I got A's in both classes really easily. You do have to put some thought into them, but 2-3 hours a week and you can get an A with EASE.",

I took another class with her later, and that was slightly more advanced/specific, but still not that hard. She seemed able to distinguish how to keep an intro class actually a simple intro class, and a more specific class a little more advanced...unlike a lot of profs who really know their subject and forget folks in an intro class might not care a ton about the subject, and treat the class like all students are as obsessed with the subject as them lol :/.",

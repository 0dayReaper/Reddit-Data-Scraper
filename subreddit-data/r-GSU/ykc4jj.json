    "postText": "I struggled in the past to fulfill the zoom meetings for online language classes when trying to do it at home. Aside from the zoom meeting aspect of the class, I much prefer the work being online in language classes, and don't want to just take it as an in person class. In spring I will have one class on campus, and want to just use that same day after class for the language class' zoom meeting (this class usually has several day and time options for these meetings you can choose from). \n\nBut I'm not sure where would be a good place to go sit on campus to do this? Ideally, I would like to go sit in an empty classroom. But the uncertainty of being able to find one that wouldn't get interrupted by a class starting in the same room makes me too anxious lol, so I'm not sure if this is a great option. Are there places around, preferably indoors, where it isn't noisy/no music playing/etc, and also where I wouldn't be bothering other people by talking? \n\nOr how hard/easy is it to secure a library or student center study room for the same specific day/time every week? Would I be able to book this room for that day/time every week for the whole semester in advance? I just worry that, like trying to find an empty classroom, the day/time of when I'd be able to get a study room can't really be guaranteed. I'd also feel kind of bad using one of these rooms all to myself, since their purpose seems to be sort of for like groups to work on projects or studying in. I don't want to take the room away from others who might really need it a lot more than me.",

There's one website (i forget but a quick google will tell u) and you can book whatever dates / timeslots you need. There are some restrictions as to how often you can schedule, but usually they're not that busy and you can stay in the rooms for longer.\n\nI just kept the website bookmarked and scheduled it whenever :)",

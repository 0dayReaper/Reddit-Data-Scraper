            "comment": "Currently living there. The furniture includes: L shaped green sofa (2 pieces), a really ugly but functional 1 cushioned seat, circle coffee table, square side table, tv stand, included tv (base average), 4 bar stools. If you want pictures, I can send them to you. Also, have fun with capped 10 mbps wifi internet. It's awful. I do enjoy the closeness to campus. Also, the breezeways are not AC, there's no ceiling vents.\n\nEdit: Another thing, everyone connects to the same wifi, but booster signals in every apartment. So you can connect to other residents wifi connected devices such as Chromecasts, google home, etc. Get your own router to connect things or else other people can play around with your devices.",

            "comment": "It comes with L shaped sofa, metal coffee table, TV stand, one singular chair, 4 bar stools. Then this American themed beany chair thing filled with little beads, pretty much just sits there and collects mold, no one sits on it ever. In the rooms, you get a tiny desk which is pretty clunky, my drawers get stuck if I open them. You also get a big dresser, and of course bedframe and night stand which is pretty good. \n\nBiggest problem with living here, is I cannot connect to the wifi in my room, I have to go out in the main room to connect to the wifi. My room is pretty much a wifi dead zone. So maybe you will get lucky and not be in that scenario, but even when you can connect it's extremly slow and capped. Also the hallways are never cooled, they pretty much will lie and tell you that they are working on fixing it, that's what they told me when I signed one year ago. I have almost had a heat stroke a couple times in the hallway. You pay ALOT for not so much besides the great location. ",

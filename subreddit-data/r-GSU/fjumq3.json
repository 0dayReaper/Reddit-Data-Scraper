I feel the same about the change to fully remote, it's gonna be a downer.\n\nYour career will be 30 years or even longer. Just know that these few months you'll not be able to do what you love in the way that you love doing it is for a great cause, the limitation of community spread, and you'll have saved lives in doing so. \n\nWe'll work together and win this, things will eventually get back to normal. I'm not your student but I thank you for selecting this career, teachers at all levels who love what they do in my experience produce a far more enjoyable class and are the ones most memorable to me. I remember the names of each and every one of them from I was 6 years old and I'm 43 now, only fond memories of how much I enjoyed their classes.",

We've just been told to convert our courses to be online, nothing about sticking to a schedule or using WebEx. \n\nIf the administration wants us to stick to a schedule they need to tell us that ASAP, because me and everyone else I know are pre-recording lectures and tossing them up on Folio for students to consume whenever.",

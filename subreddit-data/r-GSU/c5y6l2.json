The location is nice if you like to walk to campus, but it\u2019s a bit of a walk from the other apartments and weekend activities if you\u2019re into that kind of thing. Value-wise I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty equivalent to most other places in Statesboro: better than dorms but not as good as getting a house.",

As far as sound deadening/wall thickness it\u2019s pretty average for an apartment/hotel situation. If you have noisy neighbors you\u2019ll definitely hear them, but someone walking to the bathroom at 3am won\u2019t wake you up. I will say that, in my experience, there\u2019s a lot less parties at 111 than at other apartments so that helps.",

In fact, one of my friends called to complain about something that was broken when they moved in and the manager told her he \u201chad better things to do\u201d and hung up. So if you do choose 111, be very diligent and keep documentation trails.",

            "comment": "I had friends who lived over there two years ago. They told me they were having an increase in crime at the apartment, but the staff were told not to talk about it to residents even if they asked questions. And they constantly had issues getting things fixed. I don't know whether that manager still works there or not. \n\nJust avoid anywhere within a walkable distance to the stadium. As someone who has lived here for five years, my trail of eagle alerts tell me that's the area with the most crime. \n\nSome places do have buses  if you're willing to compromise on closeness to campus. The Grove and the connection are two I know of. Market 100 has one, and it's really really cheap to live there, but you definitely get what you pay for. Aspen Heights has one, but they're really far away and really expensive.",

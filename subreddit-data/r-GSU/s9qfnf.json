Like college isn't costly enough.",

            "comment": "When I was there 2 years ago, I got 5 parking tickets in a single week because my car got totaled and my new car wasn\u2019t in the system. So I never got emails about it since they stopped giving paper tickets. I was able to appeal 4 of them because I never received email tickets, but since I had been there for 5 years they said I should\u2019ve known better to not put my car in the system after getting a new plate so I still had to pay 1. So with that, if you are a new student maybe they will you cut you a break??? But you don\u2019t have to pay it immediately, you can wait till you need to get a transcript/buy a new parking pass/need your diploma before paying it, or atleast that\u2019s how it used to be.",

Though, at least in my case of having 1 class a week on campus before 4, paying for the 'visitor' parking for the like... 3 hours and then risking a $20 parking ticket In the last few minutes was worth not buying a $200 parking pass.",

Please remember: All parking lots are signed at the entrance or drive to the lot. You must have a matching permit to park in a parking lot during the day. Spaces that are different within the lot will be additionally signed. You cannot park in the commuter lots (numbered lots) without a permit until 4 pm. Residence Hall lots are enforced 24 hours. All cars parked on campus before 4 pm must have a permit. Permits are vehicle-specific and cannot be used in a vehicle not registered. Students and employees are not visitors and cannot park in visitor parking. We do issue tickets at night for parking in reserved space and safety violations. Reserved spaces include President/Vice-Presidents, Deans, Disabled, Service and Delivery, and University Vehicle. Some spaces are reserved past 4 pm. They are signed to reflect the hours they are enforced. It is your responsibility to know the rules. They are located on our website at: http://auxiliary.georgiasouthern.edu/parking/",

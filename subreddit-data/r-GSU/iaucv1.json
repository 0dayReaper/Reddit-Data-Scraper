I'm holding out just in case they convert my live classes to online at the last minute.\n\nEdit: in case you guys aren't aware, Chapel Hill is going completely online after just *one week* of classes. Please be prepared if/when this happens to GSU.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/iaucv1)",

Unfortunately, wearing a mask has turned into a political statement for some people. The people who don't want to take precautions will all get sick (they may even throw \"Covid parties\" \ud83d\ude2b) and end up spreading it to the point where GSU will move online. To me, it's more of a matter of when, not if.",

The law school administration is receptive to our pleas, but the University System of Georgia won't let any of its schools switch to pass/fail. Have any of yall tried to petition your schools and colleges and met similar resistance higher up?\n\nI for one was outraged by this sentence from the USG's statement: \"In times of adversity, we should reach higher, not lower.\" Since when has equity ever brought standards \"lower?\" If you're upset like I am, consider calling, consider calling the Board of Regents. [All their numbers are here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gcpVg1VTP96fV2bPN2WFGFhL_xcR4du9lRBjar-alqo/edit?usp=sharing). Explain how disadvantaged students are being disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nSee the AJC article:\n\n[https://www.ajc.com/blog/get-schooled/despite-student-pleas-university-system-georgia-won-change-grading-pass-fail/z1rcoeqLob8iCYcbehtnLK/?fbclid=IwAR0M8aXgVajnQXDLKAhP2kqYX\\_7d2KrHMGMzrg-S\\_cwUv4a5DOoKJHYcVXw](https://www.ajc.com/blog/get-schooled/despite-student-pleas-university-system-georgia-won-change-grading-pass-fail/z1rcoeqLob8iCYcbehtnLK/?fbclid=IwAR0M8aXgVajnQXDLKAhP2kqYX_7d2KrHMGMzrg-S_cwUv4a5DOoKJHYcVXw)\n\nSee the law student petition:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LwLEAgEB1NdZttUkHfFXwHShi83tSopIO6VZYzebBmU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LwLEAgEB1NdZttUkHfFXwHShi83tSopIO6VZYzebBmU/edit?usp=sharing)",

                    "comment": "The American law school model has a radical basis in competition, and our two law schools are no exception. The grades we earn each semester determine our class ranks relative to other students, and these ranks have a lifelong impact on our professional prospects as well as access to opportunities while in law school. We want to emphasize that our class ranks, rather than our GPA\u2019s themselves, play this pivotal role, with many judges and firms refusing to even consider the applications of those students who do not outrank a high percentage of their classmates. This level of competition is fundamentally unlike what other students experience at any of the other USG institutions of higher learning.  \n\nCombine this level of competition with the unprecedented disruption of the COVID-19 outbreak, and it is easy to see why law students are uniquely at risk. To list just a few of these disruptions: Our classmates have relocated all across the country, where many are subject to shelter-in-place orders. All have been forced to transition to online learning mid-semester, a major disruption on its own. Some are dealing with a sudden loss of income and financial uncertainty. A significant number of our peers are non-traditional students, such as parents, veterans, and international students. Some of these students are now providing childcare as well as education due to school closures which will last through law school finals. We have peers who are struggling with mental health difficulties that are exacerbated by the stress and anxiety of the crisis. Some students have disabilities, and the transition to online classes may have unintended impacts on them as they struggle to adapt to online classes with the same ease as non-disabled students. Something as simple as a quiet place to study may no longer be realistic for many students at our law schools. Poor wireless internet in the homes of many students is significantly disrupting their ability to learn. And before law school finals even begin in late April, it is quite likely that some of our peers will be caring for family members afflicted by the coronavirus or even grieving for those who have passed. \n\nThis combination of catastrophe with the competitive structure of law school poses a severe risk of inequity. It is clear that as a result, some of our classmates disproportionately bear the impact of COVID-19 in ways that are not random (for example, due to poor internet access, job loss, disruptive caregiving responsibilities, and the lack of a home environment conducive to uninterrupted study). Our two law schools, unlike nearly every other academic program in the USG, evaluate students almost entirely based on a series of final exams, rather than on assignments spaced across the semester. During normal times, adequate preparation for these exams requires several weeks of concentrated study. Many of our peers are currently facing the prospect of entering this season of preparation while under the burden of significant and sudden hardships, not of their making, which will effectively prevent them from doing their best academic work. To permit other students who are relatively unimpeded to use this semester to advance their own academic standing relative to peers who have been effectively sidelined by a pandemic raises serious concerns about the equity of USG\u2019s grading mandate. These concerns are compounded by a realization that some of the obstacles to academic performance listed above may be correlated to socioeconomic status, race, and gender.",

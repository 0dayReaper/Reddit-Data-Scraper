But the way they did it is correct, journalistically.\n\nThe rule is called \"delayed identification.\" You don't put non-famous people or places in the headline or lede, which is what we call the first sentence of a news story.\n\n&gt;And fyi, the title should say, \"A Statesboro medical practice...\" They practice family medicine.\n\nI agree with that. \n\n&gt;Where is the editor?\n\nThe editor-in-chief of the paper wrote the story. The paper has very few copy editors, despite our attempts to get more students to go work for them. I don't believe they have the money in their scant budget to pay copy editors, so the ones they do get are doing it for their resume and to help build out their portfolio (Or for the love of working with student media).\n\nWhen all this is over with, you should volunteer for a copy editing shift.",

Make friends with people who currently have jobs on campus and have them recommend you directly to whoever is doing the hiring. Throwing your application in the same mountain of applications will leave you disappointed.tgink of it this way: every 19 year olds resume is going to be nearly identical. One person worked at Kroger. You worked at Taco Bell. Somebody else worked at their parents business. Very little of that corresponds to doing data entry on work orders for the Physical Plant. Everyone is unqualified, you know?\n\nThe best way to stand out is to get someone on the inside to recommend you.",

I got that position through one of the on campus job fairs. I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re still doing them, but it\u2019s a good way to meet potential employers!",

Also, make sure you are applying to the part-time jobs, sometimes full-time jobs come up on the search! \n\nYou can always contact the managers there personally as well! I know there are going to be a bunch of openings due to students graduating. Good luck!",

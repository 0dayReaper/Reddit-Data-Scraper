    "postText": "I don't use the mail apps on my iphone and ipad. I just use the website. I had one email A, but now use email B, and have all email that goes to email B sent to the inbox for email A. But I use email B to log into stuff now days, including app on my devices...so I have to use browser on devices to check inbox A (since app goes to inbox B). \n\nBut I must have used my school email (email C lol) to log in on browser on devices at some point...and now every time I go to gmail website on my devices it auto logs it into my school email inbox, when I want it to go back to auto logging into email inbox A. Even if I log out of my school email on the gmail website on devices, when I go to the website it wants me to log into the gsu portal so it can get to the school email inbox. I don't know how to get it to stop doing this.\n\nDoes anyone have this problem too? How do I get it to stop thinking I'm trying to access my school email, and prompting me to log into the portal, when I am trying to access my other personal email inbox? Maybe this is more of a tech/apple question than a school question, but figured maybe other students had had to solve this issue before too.",

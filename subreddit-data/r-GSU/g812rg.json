Making it optional doesn\u2019t work, as students like myself who depend on the scholarship are forced into the 4.0 scale, while out of state students are allowed to slack off and essentially pass with full credit. The only actual solution is professors curving grades and accommodating different types of students. P/F is an excuse for students to finish the semester early and not do any work from home.",

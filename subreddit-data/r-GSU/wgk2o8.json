I have emailed that advisor and not gotten a response. I\u2019ve emailed the general advisor thing before and they always say go to your advisor. Any suggestions would be great lol",

Even trying to get through the general gsu email thing takes weeks to a response back- at least in my previous experiences. I\u2019ve had people tell me to call this dept, then I call them, and I have to go back to the first place. It\u2019s rather annoying.   I reread the email, it said she would be out of office indefinitely.",

I'm 4 hours away from campus myself and when my ordeal went down, I had decided to show up on campus and basically wait until someone was available. You'd think when someone retires, their advisees would be notified or the new advisor would reach out. Something.",

I've always, for years, ALWAYS waited until I had my class schedule figured out before paying. Going in final semester? They've called me 3 times asking if everything is okay because I hadn't paid tuition yet. 4-5 years? Not a peep. All of a sudden they're scrambling.",

I\u2019ve been an online student when I\u2019m supposed to be an in person student.  They apparently have a list you can be asked to be on for scholarships and grants.

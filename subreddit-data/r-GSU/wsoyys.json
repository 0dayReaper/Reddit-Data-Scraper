    "postText": "Hello everyone! I wanted to send a shoutout to anyone who lives in Southern Downs apartments. They are currently giving anyone who lives here 72 hours (until Monday at 12 pm) to move their car if:\n\n* it LOOKS like it hasn't been moved in \\[insert time they decide is appropriate\\]\n* There is visible debris\n* Your vehicle has a flat tire\n* Incorrectly parked (taking up more than one parking space)\n* On jacks/blocks/has wheels missing\n* no license plate/no registration\n* and more that can be found on page 4, section 14 of your lease (probably)\n\nFailure to adhere to these rules in the lease will allow them to TOW your car. They will begin towing on Monday, August 22nd at 12 p.m.\n\nI hope anyone who needs to see this, does before Monday. They have taped yellow papers to the cars they identified are breaking the lease. They will not give us grace period until our refunds come in. They will not entertain any special circumstances.",

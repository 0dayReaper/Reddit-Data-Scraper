    "postText": "I'm starting grad school next week and I've had a hard time trying to navigate getting a parking permit. I have an assistantship on the Armstrong Campus, and classes on the Statesboro Campus. I only have 2 classes on the Statesboro Campus once a week. Any advice on cheapest parking options? I don't mind walking a little ways, I just really don't want to pay $160 for parking when I will only be on the Statesboro Campus once a week. Any advice you could provide would be appreciated!",

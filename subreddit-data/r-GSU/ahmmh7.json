They don't say what the other 4 were arrested for, Potentially having more than an ounce? I wish Statesboro would have just copied Atlanta's laws.",

That's how we ended up with the current system we have, where police officers have the option of issuing a citation rather than arresting, but they're under no obligation or incentive to do so -- it's in their best interest to keep arresting people.

Under the new city of Atlanta ordinance possession under an ounce is punishable by a $75 fine with no jail time. APD can cite you and let you go on your way, arrest you and you'll still get the $75 fine or arrest you under the state charge and send you to Fulton county jail with a fine of $1000 and/or 6 months in jail. All of those stay on your record as an arrest for possession. ",

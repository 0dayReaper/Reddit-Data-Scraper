I read and searched but it's nowhere to be found.\n\nupdate: seems it's only there until the final day to add/ drop courses. if YOU don't opt-out then you pay for it. \n\nwhy not a opt-in and let me decide if I want to use the day1access. if at anytime I decide then full price.\n\nanother way for colleges to get your money.",

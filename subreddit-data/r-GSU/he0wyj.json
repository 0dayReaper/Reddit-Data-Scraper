This is the closest that I've found so far. Their teriyaki chicken is good. Their sushi rolls are some of the biggest, thickest rolls I've ever eaten. Skimpy on sauce.\n\nHibachi Express and Wings House: Norcross only, off of Jimmy Carter Blvd. Their teriyaki chicken bowl is okay. Their wings are good. No sushi.\n\nHibachi Express: Tucker off LaVista. I went once and never again. Shares a building with a Chevron. Meal took too long from order to eating. Chicken was dry and rice was bad.\n\nFugu Express Hibachi and Poke: Dunwoody in the same parking lot as the Goodwill. Wasn't bad, but not memorable enough for me to go out of my way to get it again. Portion was small for what I paid.\n\nAnd...that's it. There's one in Duluth I haven't tried yet called Choo Choo Express. If you try it, let me know!",

The general student body is comprised of young, mostly healthy students. Even if the virus spread amongst a relatively large population, the amount of those at risk is drastically lower than sending kids home to older parents/grandparents etc, and potentially being carriers for the disease as most young people won\u2019t be hospitalized. \n\nI\u2019m not an expert in diseases or disease models, but it seems like our best option is to limit physical interaction, but also limit the spread of the disease to those who can afford to get it. Cancelling school and switching to online coursework sounds great, but to most students that\u2019s a second spring break, and will probably be negligent towards the spread of disease. As a side affect, most students aren\u2019t going to learn from virtual education, over half my classes are physical class only, no online stuff. Cancel school if you want, but overall I think it\u2019s okay to have physical class",

The best course of action should be to slow down the spreading, so the hospitals with severe cases of COVID-19 are less likely to be overwhelmed. With how easily this spreads, a few infected students (who probably won\u2019t even know they are infected) could easily start a mass spreading at any of the universities in GA. They should ATLEAST make lectures or classes over 50 people go full online. \n\nThat\u2019s my opinion lol",

I\u2019m not sure closing schools temporarily is the best answer. \n\nI\u2019m also not saying inaction is a good option, but I think we will find the communities who have closed universities are still going to get wrecked.",

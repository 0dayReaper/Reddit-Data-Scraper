    "postText": "I recently started thinking about how great some of the professors I\u2019ve had during my two years at Georgia Southern were to me and fellow classmates\u2014 a few professors in the Chemistry Department have been kind enough to let me shadow in their research labs and have even written recommendation letters on my behalf for summer enrichment programs and REUs (of which I\u2019m still grateful for). My POLS 1101 professor, Dr. Pirro, was great and actually made the course much more engaging than I initially thought it would be...\n\nI know it\u2019s often easy to settle on the undesirable occurrences that come with being a student, but what are some things that you remember a professor doing for you that made you appreciate them?",

After I finished his class him &amp; I went out for lunch &amp; drinks a few times. Truly a great man who is very very smart. 11/10 recommend taking his classes if you have the opportunity",

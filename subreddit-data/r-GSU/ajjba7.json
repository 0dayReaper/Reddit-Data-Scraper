He\u2019s definitely guaranteed he will not be re-elected (if he\u2019s planning to run again next year, not sure if he\u2019s graduating soon). ",

It was embarrassing for the SGA and the university. I hope both he has no plans to run again, because he\u2019s going to get dragged if he does. ",

I\u2019ve already graduated but reading that pissed me off so much I honestly  am considering driving down to Statesboro from north Atlanta for the next SGA meeting just to tear him a new asshole. Honestly I think current students should look into impeachment measures for him. Seems like they admitted surveying students and got mostly negative responses, but still decided to go ahead with the plan anyways. ",

Forcing hundreds of students to drive an hour to a campus (or random unaffiliated building for the 3 colleges at armstrong) they have never stepped foot on to graduate?  Plus no more walking at Paulson?!?! The whole thing is a damn sham I'm glad I had the opportunity to graduate how and when I did, because I will definitely be skipping out on this madness as a grad student.",

The leaders of the SGA, the RHA, and CLU all buddy up with the administration to get good references on the resumes or because they don't think to question their authority rather than actually doing the hard work to stand up and advocate for everyone paying tution and the fees that support the organizations.

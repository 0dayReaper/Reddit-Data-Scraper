    "postText": "I really wish I took this class online during the summer and not now lol. It's just so tedious. If you have a single attendance penalty, you don't get any grade adjustments. One time, I came in early, went to the restroom, and even though I came back right when class started, I was forced to sign the late attendance sheet. The TA literally saw me come in earlier. I regret not disputing that earlier. I have no idea how flexible Vlcek is, but his demeanor seems very black and white.",

            "comment": "Yes I took the class. It's really not so bad. Just some lame assignments that take up time you should be spending on other stuff like senior design and final projects. Just make sure you do moderately well on the quizzes, and absolutely do not cheat on anything. There is a zero tolerance policy for cheating. Would suck to not graduate because of that one class, but it happened to a few.",

What I'm more concerned about is my one measly tardy (which wasn't really a tardy), not that there's anything I can really do about that. I would be fine with a D or C at this point.",

If you are in a tight spot or are concerned, you can always go to the office hours. I think Vlcek is more awkward than he is mean or unapproachable.",

It says that cell phone usage is recorded in class and if you're caught, you get a zero that day. I swear I've seen dozens of students on their phone anyway lmao.",

And god help you if you are doing staff research assistance too. I took senior seminar and his mandatory research class in the same semester, and half of it was direct repeat information.",

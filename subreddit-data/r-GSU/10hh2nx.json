    "postText": "I am offering tutoring services for students in need of assistance in math, physics, chemistry, organic chemistry, and engineering classes. I have experience in all levels of these subjects and am dedicated to helping students succeed in their studies.\n\nAs an introduction to my services, I am offering a free 20-minute Zoom session for anyone who is interested. During this session, we can discuss your specific needs and how I can help you achieve your goals.\n\nI understand that the cost of tutoring can be a concern, so I am also offering discounts for group sessions. If you have a group of friends or classmates who need help in the same subject, we can schedule a session together and save on the cost.\n\nIf you are interested in scheduling a session or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. I am here to help and am excited to work with you!",

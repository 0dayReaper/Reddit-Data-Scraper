The one I want has a lab and I've asked professors before but its always \"the lab is full can't do anything about it\". Is it possible to do a section of lab that isn't from the same section lecture? \n\nKind of a long shot but anyone doing Data Structures CRN 17626 (MW 12:30 and F 9:00) and wanna change? I'm desperate.  ",

Second, waitlist for the class. Third, fill out the override form if there is one. That\u2019s going to be your best bet other than finding someone else to switch out with you.",

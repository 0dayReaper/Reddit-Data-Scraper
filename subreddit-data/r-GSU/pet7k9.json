    "postText": "Hopefully some mechanical engineering majors (and others) can relate to this:\n\nA lot of the companies that come to these fairs don't really cater to us and are mostly there for electrical, civil, construction, and computer engineers. I still go to the fairs for the few companies that do cater to MEs, but me going up to the other companies can feel like an exercise in futility. I tell them my major and that I'm open minded and eager to learn new fields, but they just end up telling me, \"oh we don't really hire from your major, but you're more than welcome to apply on our website if you're still interested.\"",

Don't know how much it's changed since my last career fair but the last one I went to felt like 60% of it was for construction.\n\nI eventually just gave up going to them because it wasn't worth my time. I always had much better luck mass applying to jobs without cover letters.\n\nI call it the \"firing a machine gun in the dark\" technique.",

Like you have to put a lot of effort in each individual application.\n\nI don't think it's really changed much, I started going to them in Fall 2018 and they're not too different from what you described.",

It looked like this:\n\nColumn A: Company name\nColumn B: Location (City, State)\nColumn C: Hyperlink to job posting\nColumn D: Applied? (check box for Yes/No)\nColumn E: Date Applied \nColumn F: General notes \n\nI also had a color code. So if I noticed that the job posting was no longer available I would mark the entire row out with orange. If I got a rejection email I would mark the entire row out in red. If I got an offer I would mark the entire row out in green.\n\nThe Google sheet I made was really helpful to visualize what was going on. After you apply to about 5 places you start to forget who is who, where they are, etc.",

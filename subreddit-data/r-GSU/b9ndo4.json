Its a good way to get booked at Nonna yourself and hell maybe I can help you out at other places in town.\n\nAnyway, come to open mic! \n\nP.S. if you play something like drums, bass, or guitar... feel free to bring your gear and we can just jam! I met my own band through hosting open mic, so its a good way to network. \n\nIf you have any Q\u2019s feel free to PM me!",

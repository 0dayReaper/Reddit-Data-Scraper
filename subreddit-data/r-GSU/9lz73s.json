    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m a student here, and I have pretty bad social anxiety. I know that part of the \u201ccollege experience\u201d is getting out and enjoying yourself, but this is proving especially hard for me. I wanted to go to Paulson today to watch the game, but couldn\u2019t find a parking space and ultimately just ended up going back to my dorm. Are there any places (that aren\u2019t bars) where I could watch the game some other time, or am I SOL? I hate to miss out; having a panic attack in public isn\u2019t preferable, either. ",

It\u2019s a really fun place, but it gets very loud and aggressive and could lead to a panic attack. I recommend going around to the home side and sitting with alumni, or heading up to the top deck above the student section just until you feel comfortable with the crowd. ",

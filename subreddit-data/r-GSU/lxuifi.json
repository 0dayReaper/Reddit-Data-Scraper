            "comment": "I\u2019m a current freshman. I live in Eagle Village and love it. It truly is the best dorm on campus. \n\nIt\u2019s further away from everything than Centennial, but also has lighter security (no front desk) which makes it easier to sneak in alcohol (not that I do that). It\u2019s also cheaper than Centennial but has virtually the same features. \n\nI don\u2019t like Southern Courtyard or Southern Pines at all because they have lots of problems with bugs (especially roaches) and raccoons due to being motel style. Your dorm room door will open up to the outside which I dislike. Eagle Village, Centennial, and Watson are hotel style, so the dorms open up to a hallway. \n\nWatson is the cheapest but you will be sharing a room. Every other dorm gives you your own room with shared common areas. \n\nFreedom\u2019s is nice but super far away from everything. If you don\u2019t have a car, you\u2019re looking at a long ass walk everyday. It\u2019s supposed to be an upperclassman dorm because it\u2019s basically off campus living for on campus prices, but due to the large incoming freshman class all on campus housing is being turned into freshman housing.\n\nFeel free to dm me if you have anymore questions!",

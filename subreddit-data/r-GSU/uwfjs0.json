Once landed at the airport they recommend at least $60 ( ARMSTRONG CAMPUS -100 ( STATESBORO CAMPUS )for a ride from the airport ( SAVANNAH-HILTON HEAD).   once admitted to GSU, they make you do soar. That\u2019s $75.  Per gsu website, International students should be on campus by august 4 due to soar ( orientation).   I also feel that anyone coming from another country to ( basically  rural) southern GA is gonna have an honest to god culture shock if they have not been here beforehand.  Rent is like $450 shared with other people",

Buying food from the grocery store is expensive due to inflation - like everywhere else.    I have friends whose parents grew up north and friends whose grew up south.

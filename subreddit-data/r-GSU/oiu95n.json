    "postText": "The only business classes I have taken so far is financial and managerial accounting and is wondering if this is a manageable and a good schedule? I never took a 3000 level before and my only 2000 levels were my accounting classes. I also will be volunteering and having a part time job for 3 times the week from 5 pm to 10 pm. I would ask my advisor but she\u2019s out of the office. :(\n\nMonday: \nBUSA 1105 intro to business \n\nTuesday:\n \nFINC 3131 principles of corporate finance \n\nECON 2106 Principles of microeconomics\n\nMKTG 3131 Principles of marketing \n\n(About 2 hours in between classes)\n\nWednesday: \nBUSA 1105 intro to business \n\nThursday: \n\nFINC 3131 principles of corporate finance \n\nECON 2106 Principles of microeconomics\n\nMKTG 3131 Principles of marketing \n\n(About 2 hours in between classes)\n\nFriday:\nBUSA 1105 intro to business \n\nOther: Online class\nCISM 2530 Advanced Business Applications",

            "comment": "My biggest suggestion is to actually be productive during those hours between your classes on Tuesday and Thursday. I used to make a similar schedule when I was in school (got my business management degree in 2016 for reference so many similar classes) and would have really busy days mixed with really easy days of only one or two classes. The biggest hurdle for me was thinking \"oh I have two hours to kill before my next class, gonna go home and nap\" when I easily could've just stayed on campus to eat and get work done. If you're good at managing your own time and can stay on top of your school work I think this type of schedule works really well.",

Intro to Business is a joke as long as you remember to do the homework, it's just time consuming. FINC was difficult for me but thats also because it was a lot of material and it was online only, take good notes in class and make sure you have the book, excel is a life saver if you have a laptop to keep examples on. I'll be honest I forgot about CISM 2530, can't tell you much about it.\n\nIf you know your professors you can reply and I'll let you know what people say about them or what I've experienced!",

Pack whatever you need and don\u2019t leave campus until every class is over. You can chill at the library, dining hall, union, (or really anywhere) and do homework/study in between classes. \n\nDon\u2019t go back to your dorm or apartment. I did that last semester and got absolutely nothing done. I was so much more productive when I stayed on campus working than \u201cworking\u201d in my dorm. I usually ended up napping or scrolling on tiktok for hours on end. \n\nIf you do your work in between classes, you\u2019ll have more time to yourself at night to go out and do whatever you want to do.",

The prof was bolnakis or something like that. I\u2019m certain I\u2019m not spelling it right but overall a tough class",

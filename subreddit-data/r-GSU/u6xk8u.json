The \"deadlines\" are encouraged, but if it's a little later, that's fine.\n\nEdit: The longer you wait, the more of an issue securing housing can be. It also takes time for you to be \"processed\" and entered into the system, financial aid profile built, AP/Dual Enrollment credits evaluated, do your preference form for scheduling, etc... I've had students added the first day of classes, but they didn't need housing.  If you need housing, and are intent on studying here, make sure there's still housing and take the next step asap.",

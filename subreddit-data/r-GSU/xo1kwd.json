    "postText": "Is anyone else having issues getting into the gym? I've been sent all over the place from registration to financial aid to student accounts to Auxillary to the gym/student rec center back to financial aid etc etc. When I go to the rec center, they say that my tuition isn't paid for (it is). I have confirmed this through Auxillary, advisement, registration, and student accounts. I don't know why they don't match but my card will not swipe. No one has helped me and it's been two weeks. If you have advice please let me know. It's honestly so ridiculous how bad administrative stuff is at GSU. I'm so tired of being tossed around without any solutions.",

            "comment": "This may be dumb, but you mention that your tuition is paid. Does your account reflect that you have RAC fees? Tuition and RAC fees are separate.\n\nEdit: Specifically, make sure you have the following:\n- Athletic Fee (Fall) (though this just may be for sports)\n- RAC Fees and Expansion - Fall\n- Athletic Facility Fee- Fall",

            "comment": "Start getting emails of the people you're talking to. Create an email thread. Start emailing everybody. Every time you go to the gym and it won't swipe, email the chain of people. You're paying the fee to use it, you're a student, you literally aren't getting what the school is supposed to provide you. Work your way up the food chain, if Brenda at a front desk can't help, who is her boss? Email both of them in the chain along with whoever else. Once you leave an office, they forget about you. But if you get an email thread going, you're able to talk to everyone, everyday about it. Someone can find an answer, you just have to become a big enough problem to get it resolved. Just keep working up the ladder and become relentless about it. Hell I'd even consider filing a police report for theft by deception. You can file a report about anything lol. They took your fee and aren't providing you with what you paid for. What else is it? Sometimes just having law enforcement present will push someone into actually helping. It's dramatic, but I've seen it work personally in other situations.",

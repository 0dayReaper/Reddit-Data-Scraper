We\u2019re going to take those concerns and get better.\u201d\n\nWe all make mistakes and hopefully, GSU will learn and change for the next commencement.",

We're now having to eat Armstrong's massive budget shortfalls plus their plummeting enrollment numbers. The Statesboro campus was only down about 2% overall, Armstrong was down 14% because of their own incompetence, so now the whole consolidated Georgia Southern University is responsible for  fixing that. The \"solutions\" have been drastic: zero dollars for adjuncts, instructors laid off, lecturers and TT faculty expected to teach extra classes without any additional pay, and expanded class size limits that in some cases violate the terms of accreditation. We're also being told that there's pretty much no new lines coming in the foreseeable future. All of this is going to lead to us losing the R2 status we just got last year. \n\nOur departmental and college-level budgets are fucked, and it's entirely the fault of Armstrong being mismanaged for a decade and then getting glued to us to fix it.",

It sounds like the graduate courses on Saturday idea was more of a suggestion but not necessarily required. A quick course search for next semester shows 90 classes on the Statesboro campus scheduled to start after 6pm, though I have no idea how that compares with a \"normal\" semester.",

When signing up for classes before there were early classes available, and evening classes available, etc. I'm not a grad student, but I'm the age range of a typical grad student, and have friends in grad programs elsewhere, and they've had classes that met on saturdays before, as well as mandatory weekend workshops that only met once or twice, so even that sounds pretty normal to me.",

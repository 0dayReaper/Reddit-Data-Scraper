Most places with have about equal or more people in them but Southern\u2019s staff keeps the lines moving extremely well. I can\u2019t think of a single time I had to wait more than 5 minutes maximum in a line at Southern. I never skipped a line or passed up something due to the length. The only time I passed was the sandwich shop in the IT building because they make them on the spot and it takes a little bit, but that\u2019s waiting on the end after ordering.",

But he latter is usually not bad at all, and if you have the time around classes to be ordering food and waiting for it, then you'll have time to wait in whatever small line there might be there. And they're usually pretty well staffed and pretty fast to get you your food, and the line usually moves fairly fast. That starbucks on the other hand...maybe it's just because I used to work at one myself and I'm picky because of that lol, but this location seems kinda unorganized at times/like they don't understand how to handle a peak or a long line. Any line to order usually moves fast, but then it can be a long wait to get your order because they might only have one person working bar, and that person is like randomly stepping away to do other things too...it's weird.",

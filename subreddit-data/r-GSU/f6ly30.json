Guy got beat to death by a bouncer at Dingus Magee's in 2015, his parents enacted a law prohibiting anyone under 21 from entering a bar in Georgia.\n\nEnforcement varies around Georgia, but since it started in Statesboro, there's no way anyone there can get away with it anymore.\n\nIt sucks though, because meeting people outside of a bar or club can be tough.",

    "postText": "Hey guys so i ended community college with a 3.4 gpa (AA in information technology) but I\u2019ve decided to change my major to Information Systems going into GSU. GSU accepted some of my credits so now I\u2019m starting off with a 2.3 GPA. That is farley low considering I ended CC with a 3.4 GPA. Has this a happened to anyone as a transfer student? Was it hard for you to pick up your gpa? Do you think it\u2019s even worth it to continue? \nI feel like I would really like this school but the fact that they are accepting such a low gpa is kind of discouraging. \nWelcoming all responses/ Opinions\nThanks",

But on your transcript, it will be 3.4. Unless you took real funky classes that are not accepted by the USG? Idk maybe someone here will know but I know the registrar's office could easily answer that question.\n\nThen you will have your Total GPA at graduation (transfer + institutional). \n\nI imagine during their evaluation they took your whole transcript into consideration (3.4 GPA). If they only accepted a portion of your transcript I imagine you have over 60 hours to go for a bachelor's degree, which is plenty enough time to get back into the 3.0s. And if GS only accepted a portion of the classes any other major university in the State will do the same.",

Some of your CC classes are not offered at GS or did not meet our academic standards. \n\nYou will start of with a 0.00 institutional GPA. I think your transfer and total GPA sits at a 2.3 but I may be wrong. Reach out to the registrars office for a more detailed explanation. \n\nThis is all normal. They didn\u2019t except some classes from ABAC way back when I transferred in. 60 plus hours left of classes is plenty of time to build up your total GPA.",

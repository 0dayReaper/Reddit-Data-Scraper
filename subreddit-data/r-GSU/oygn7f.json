Its really easy to say that when you haven't had to watch a once healthy adult's O2 levels slowly deplete while they are being pumped full of liquid oxygen to no avail. If I can sacrifice some \"fun\" to spare somebody else that horrid nightmare, then by al means I will. I'm glad you are having fun though.",

I am also aware that me wearing a mask isn't to protect myself or other vaccinated people, but to protect the unvaccinated. \n\nIf you're a student and are still unvaccinated, [I would highly suggest you use this site to search your ZIP code for available vaccines](https://www.vaccines.gov/search/) and try to get your first poke before classes start next week. COVID is going to run absolutely roughshod through unvaccinated students next week, and the EGRMC is already nearly full.",

As breakthrough cases are often asymptomatic or mild, many who contract it do not get tested. \n\nThe numbers issue aside, there are students, faculty, and staff who cannot receive vaccines due to existing medical conditions, but they have no choice but to be on campus under GSUs current policies. Even those that can vaccinate may have to go home to underage (unvaccinated) children at the end of the day, putting them at extra risk. Let\u2019s also not forget about all of the local businesses that will be impacted by the spread from campus. I think we\u2019re in for a rough ride.",

They're not even keeping hybrid classes for fall. I'm so pissed off with how the board is handling the situation, but since this is my last semester at GSU, there's not much I can do but finish my degree and stay as safe as possible.\n\nThe virus may perpetuate on school campuses for years if the board keeps downgrading safety mandates too damn early.",

    "postText": "A recent post made me realize that there was a lack of information regarding things for students to do at Georgia Southern. I thought it would be a good idea to conglomerate some interesting things going on on campus and around town in Statesboro. I would like to try to do this every week if it is possible and well received. Let me know what you think and feel free to add any events in the comments that I missed or any parties going on in town.\n\n# Athletics\n\nFriday 10/19\n\n* [Women\u2019s Swimming vs UNC Ashville (Aquatics Center @ 4 pm)](https://gseagles.com/index.aspx?path=swim)\n* [Softball vs Brewton Parker (Eagle Softball Field @ 5 pm)](https://gseagles.com/index.aspx?path=softball)\n\nSaturday 10/20\n\n* [Men\u2019s Soccer vs GAST (Eagle Soccer Field @ 7 pm)](https://gseagles.com/index.aspx?path=msoc)\n\n# On Campus\n\nMonday 10/15\n\n* [Unpacking Privilege: Part of the PDAC Workshop Series (Russell Union, Rm 2047 @11:30 am)](https://calendar.georgiasouthern.edu/event/unpacking_privilege#.W8Dj5GhKhPY)\n* [Sphere: Here be Dragons: Artist Talk (Arts Building, Rm 2071 @ 5 pm)](https://calendar.georgiasouthern.edu/event/sphere_here_be_dragons#.W8DjI2hKhPY)\n\nTuesday 10/16\n\n* [Faculty Series Music Recital, Tim Kintzinger, Trumpet (Foy Building, Carol A.

We\u2019re trying to help musicians meet each other and network to revive a dead music scene here in Statesboro. I actually met the members of my band through open mic. We usually have the full set up- drums, bass, and guitars for anyone who wants to play. \n\nSo if you\u2019re interested in playing music around here or want to start a band- come on out! I\u2019m also happy to help regulars start booking their first gigs around here if you\u2019re good!",

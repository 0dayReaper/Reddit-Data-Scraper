    "postText": "I'm considering applying and taking Physics 1 and 2 over the summer as a post-bacc student. Either PHYS1111K and PHYS1112K, or PHYS2211K and PHYS2212K. This would be 8 credits in 8 weeks. These courses are prerequisites for a degree program I'm interested in.\n\n\nI imagine the courses are very fast paced, but I won't be taking any other classes. I just have a 40hr/week 9-5 hybrid job. Is this doable? How much work am I signing up for?",

            "comment": "Those are tough classes. I've had a few of my students take it. They didn't have 9-5 and they were also more conditioned as students (not sure how long you've been out of it, can be hard to turn student mode on). One of my students took 2211 in A term and the professor said they expected 3-4 hours a day to be spent. Did it happen? No but it was 2 hours",

    "postText": "Sooo apparently freshmen have to get a specific meal plan but no one has told us which one? I emailed the dining director and they haven\u2019t emailed me back in 2 weeks. Do we really have to spend $1725 or can we chose a different one? \n\nAlso, does anyone know if you live on campus can you also purchase a commuter parking permit?",

Personally I chose the gold one which includes $100 dining dollars which was a godsend for me on some days. The differences are clearly laid out on georgia southern\u2019s website &amp; you can see it in my georgia southern as well.\n\nEdit: spelling",

            "comment": "There are other meal plans, but the gold and blue allow you to go to dinning halls unlimited, gives you guest passes, and dinning dollars.  The eagle express gives you money on your card for you to spend anywhere that accepts it, and budget bucks gives you a stipend amount of money every week to spend at eagle dinning locations.  I do not think Freshmen has to pick blue or gold, I knew some freshmen who just had eagle express or budget bucks.  Choose whichever one works for you the best.",

Max I had to wait for a bus last year was probably 10 minutes. 3 minutes was probably the average.\n\nYou will have to leave for your classes probably 30 minutes early though, especially in the morning. 7:45-7:50 buses are packed.",

Idk if you know this or not, but the bus stop for freedom's is at the stadium so you have to walk to the back of freedoms and then across the stadium lot.  there's 3/4 buses on the gold route at a given time, and then 1-2 on the stadium shuttle so the buses are coming constantly",

Once you walk from FL to the bus stop, there will likely be a bus waiting for you already.\n\nEarly morning buses and lunch and late afternoon will be the most packed, so add extra time to wait for the next bus to come if you can\u2019t get on because it is full.\n\nI lived in FL junior year and was only late if I woke up late or left late for class.",

Our closest bike shops are 1-2 hours away. School starts in about two weeks and I\u2019m busy with work. At this point, I don\u2019t really have much more time to keep looking for one that will fit me. So I\u2019m trying to look for alternatives until I can find a bicycle for myself.",

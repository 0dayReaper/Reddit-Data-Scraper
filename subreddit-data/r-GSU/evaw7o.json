    "postText": "I am a transfer student coming in Fall 2020 as a Nursing major. I\u2019m trying to find the best apartments to live in off campus! I\u2019ve looked into the Islands and didn\u2019t know if y\u2019all or anyone you know lives there! I\u2019d appreciate any information on houses, apartments, or condos. I\u2019ve looked into 111 South, the Hudson, and the Monarch. Also I am possibly looking for roommates. I am 18 and will be a sophomore at GSU in the Fall, I have one of my friends who might be my roommate but if she doesn\u2019t I would love to make new friends who would want to room with me! I\u2019m rushing as well so we could rush together!! Comment or message me!!",

I'll be there for only 6 months since I'm taking over someone else's lease.\n\nI started out rough with my roommates, but it's gotten better. As for the apartment itself, it's quite nice for the money (I'm in a 4BD/4.5BR), which is $565/month. All the Monarch units have a half bath, which is nice for guests. My room is quite large, I was able to fit two desks in there and still have a wide open area. The unlimited coffee/tea/hot cocoa is nice, too. Their website lists the other amenities they have.\n\nWelcome to Southern!",

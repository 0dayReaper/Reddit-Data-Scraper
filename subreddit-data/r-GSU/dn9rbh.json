    "postText": "Found the recipe from an old reddit thread here (bless you). Posting what I do to recreate from home because yes. \n\nMarket Street Deli Bagel Fries:\n\nYou\u2019ll need:\n\n1-2 sticks of butter (I use Land of Lakes -Salted)\nSea salt\n1 bag plain bagels (I use mini bagels for smaller fries but any works)\n\nPreheat Oven to 350\u00b0\nSoak cut up bagels in melted butter. \nSprinkle with sea salt\nBake for about 15 minutes = crispy. Less time = more chewy. \nSprinkle with more salt to taste if needed. \n\nVoila. You now have bagel fries. \ud83c\udf5f \ud83e\udd6f \n\nAlas the glorious sauce to dip them in is still a mystery to me, but I\u2019ve found possible ingredients from the old reddit: (any extra insight would also be \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb )\n\nYou\u2019ll need:\n\nCaesar Dressing\nMayo\nBlack peppercorn\nAsiago Cheese \nParmesan cheese \n\nMix together. Measurements according to taste.\n\nVoila. Sauce. \ud83e\udd63\n\nHAIL SOUTHERN AND MARKET STREET. \ud83e\udd6a",

They are only the tests given through Athletics or University Health Services, and Health Services only accepts students with symptoms for testing via appointment. Self Reported also represents the people who weren't accepted by Health Services but tested positive somewhere else. They have testing times set up with the health department specifically for students and faculty, encouraging us to go, yet those cases are considered Self Reported rather than University Confirmed.",

    "postText": "Hello! I've been doing some research about going to school, mostly into early childhood education, nursing, or cosmetology. Cosmetology is there if I can't see myself doing either of the first two, but those are the main ones. When reading about college I'm so lost, I don't understand credits, how classes work, how to get in, etc. \n\nI've never had anyone talk to me about this, I'd be the only one in my small family to go to college. It's all very overwhelming looking into this by myself, not really sure where to start or what to do. I've just been watching teaching and nursing videos on youtube.\n\nI'm not the brightest, I'm afraid I'll struggle a lot, my weakness is math. Also I'm kind of shy, one of the reasons why I want to do something, to open up and be there for others. \n\nAny advice for this? Anything is welcome, sorry about this post it's very embarrassing.",

If you don't have one of those still not a problem. If you contact GSU admissions they will walk you through anything you need to do but mostly it's just applying and sending transcripts. Once you are enrolled you are assigned a counselor who literally can answer any question you have about classes there. Nothing wrong with being undeclared for a while and just take classes in a couple different fields and see what you like. I went to GSU back in 06 and loved it.",

For instance, this semester I have a large room Psychology lecture class with 48 students; but between those who zoom and those who go physically, and those who go at all, it's more like 10-15 physical all spaced out. But then there's my small room Art History class where literally 2-3 of us show up physically, out of 60, and the rest of the class zoom into it. So it's really random! But next semester, as things get more normal, we'll probably have more consistent classroom sizes, at least for core classes. This is all relative to my experience though!",

            "comment": "You've got a lot of great info provided already, but to answer the direct questions you asked:   (I don't understand credits, how classes work, how to get in. )\n\nCaveat: this was my experience from 2010 - 2014, so a while ago, and pre-pandemic.\n\n* Credits - These are super similar to high school, just with some tweaks.\n   * In both HS and College, you need a specific amount of credits to graduate. \n   * In HS (mine at least), each class was worth 1 credit and you needed 26-ish to graduate.\n   * In a 4 year degree program at GSU, classes range from 1 - 5 credits and you'll need at least 120 credits, depending on the program. My math degree was 126 credits I believe.\n   * You'll also notice the term credit hours. The amount of credits a class is worth is indicative of *approximately* how many hours/week that class is. Most standard classes are 3 credits/credit hours (At GSU when I was there, this was 3 days per week with each class session being 50 minutes, or 2 days/week with each class session being 75 minutes). Most classes with a lab component are 4 credits, usually science courses that are 3 credits in the classroom (2-3 days per week as mentioned above) and then an extra day of the week with a session in the actual science lab for 4th credit, this is usually a 2-3 hours session.\n   * There are some \"intro to college\" and other type classes that are 1 and 2 credits that meet once or twice a week for less time than a 3 credit class. And some majors have some 5 hours courses I think, and they're more content and/or more lab time, I think nursing may have some of these. Maybe the \"clinicals?\" are 5 credit hours?\n* How classes work - Kinda like HS, but professors are less like parents/baby-sitters.\n   * You have a class schedule that you choose. Certain classes at certain times. You go to class when it starts, do the learning, etc., and then you may have another class directly after, like in HS, or you may not have another class for an hour and you have break.\n   * Some people will schedule their classes back to back, 2-4 at a time. This is usually done by students that don't live on campus, so that it's more like HS or work, where you go to campus, do all your classes, then go study somewhere or go home.\n   * Some people will schedule their classes spread out through the day and study, exercise, nap, whatever, between classes. This is more often done by those living on-campus or nearby.\n   * Some professors assign homework and some don't. Those that do may or may not grade it. Some professors take attendance and some don't. Advice: go to class as much as possible. It's dumb to skip just because you don't feel like it that day. You'll only hurt yourself by doing that. I watched so many students fail classes because they failed the tests because they skipped so damn many of the class sessions!\n* How to get in - Fill out an application online, there's a fee to do this ($30-$60 if I recall correctly, seven years ago), it's dumb, no one likes it, but that's how it is at the vast majority of institutions. \n   * You'll receive a letter of acceptance or rejection. There was also a \"conditional acceptance\" program when I was there called the Eagle Incentive Program (EIP) where students on the fence with low GPAs or low SAT/ACT scores could take a few summer classes and if they passed those then they be admitted as full students.\n   * After you're accepted, you'll get an invite to attend a summer orientation session where you'll tour the campus, choose your first semester of classes, learn all the GSU traditions, etc. At this point a student account will be created and you can go online and pay for everything. Once you're signed up for classes, then you just show up for classes on the first day(s).\n   * If you're gonna live on-campus there's some other stuff for moving into the dorms that you'll get notified of.\n* Summer classes (as mentioned in the EIP bit): There are summer sessions in addition to the fall and spring semesters that offer full courses. They are condensed down a little, but worth no less credit. They meet everyday, M-F, for a few hours, instead of only 2-3 times/week as described above)",

I'm also not sure at all if y'all are interested in asking any questions about Student Media, the George-Anne or anything else but I thought it would be worth a shot.\n\nWith that said I'm down to answer anything you're interested in. If you'd like to discuss our structure, shortcomings, specific stories, etc. I'm up for it. \n\nIf you don't want to ask your question here or have a very specific request don't hesitate to shoot me an email to gaeditor@georgiasouthern.edu.\n\nQuick edit: I'm practically on reddit all day off and on so I'll answer questions as they come up for the next few days. \n\nFinal edit: I'll continue to answer questions as they appear or you can simply send me an email (listed above) or a PM on reddit. It's been quite fun to answer y'alls questions and hear your concerns. It's not often we get such direct feedback and criticism from the people we're trying to reach so I thank all of you immensely for participating. If you ever want to voice your concerns, pose questions or chat feel free to swing by the Student Media office in the Williams Center come Fall, I'll probably be there. I'll see you all (hopefully) on campus this Fall. \n\nP.S Send letters to the editor to letters@georgiasouthern.edu or gaeditor@georgiasouthern.edu, we'd love to hear from you. \n\nCheers, \n\nWcP\n",

The one in particular that I am speaking of is the Tony Award article that was published in April of this year. Now usually when I read a G-A article I take it with a grain of salt, however the article was oozing with incorrect statements.  Why put through an article like that without fact checking it?",

You can find mistakes here and there in nearly every story you read. Now, making mistakes is not in any sense \"good,\" but we are a student organization predicated on delivering a quality product to students and providing a learning environment for our members. That learning environment breeds great ideas and not so great ideas, good stories and stories I'd rather not remember. \n\nAs you might have guessed, the two goals stated above are at a constant struggle. We want people to create sound, effective work but we also want them to push their boundaries and try new things. Trying new things means you fuck up once or twice. \n\nTo your specific question about specific articles: To be frank we fact check, copy edit, read, reread and reread again every story we have time to. Unfortunately, we have a limited staff, and each person on staff has limited time, and each person on staff has class in the morning and tests to study for like other students. \n\nIn the end the mistakes in the article you mentioned, or any article for that matter, are unacceptable. There is no sugarcoating an error but rest assured that for every error you see there are more I'm bitching at writers (and myself) about. Thanks for your comment and I appreciate you reading our work. ",

A lot of people acted like we were the coolest fucking thing on the planet and we had to be hyper serious and professional all the time. But, spoilers ahead people, we're college students. \n\nI will say that our culture has changed and has been changing for a few months. A brief walk around our newsroom and you'll find photos of cats wearing bowties, Photoshop illustrations of former staff with horse bodies and those weird [googly eye](http://www.stupid.com/assets/images/GOOGTRE_2.jpg) things that I don't know the purpose of laden across monitors and photos.\n\nWe don't talk ourselves too seriously anymore but I think we know when professionalism needs to be priority number one. Thanks for the question. \n\nEDIT: Oh, and as far as redesign goes, yes we are most certainly taking all things into consideration when it comes to making the paper as student driven as possible. I'm apprehensively hopeful we can achieve that.",

This whole internet thing means no one will ever forget what we did 5 years ago.\n\nI don't think there's one answer to this question but I think it comes down to understanding as a young, college student that what you write, no matter how trivial or unassuming, can come back to haunt you. \n\nAnd to be honest I hadn't thought about a specific training/whatever program to address this but I am thinking about it now. The repercussions from messing up just once could be devastating to someone's future and they might not even know it, that burden shouldn't be laid on just the person who wrote the piece. \n\nThanks for the question and I hope all is well in Indiana.

However, I do know we purchased more racks recently which *should* make it so we can deliver to more buildings/areas around campus and elsewhere. \n\nMy best guess is because the building you're in is low in student traffic, which is our primary reading demographic, the distribution fellas elected to forgo having a rack in your building. Which sucks, obviously. \n\nIn reality, the distribution for the paper, or anything Student Media related, is handled by Student Media's marketing division, which you can contact at smmarketing@georgiasouthern.edu for more detailed responses on the subject.

After working on the paper until the wee hours, and then working on classwork, some of us would crash on the couches in the G-A offices. We even found out one guy, who had been kicked out by his girlfriend, was living in the old Reflector offices while he saved up for a place of his own. (I think we kept that bit of information from our adviser.) Just curious: Is the G-A still a fun, irreverent, crazy place to work?",

I thought that we were getting shafted, frankly. \n\nBUT, as soon as I started travelling to conferences around the state and country I immediately took that back. There are many universities who intentionally squander any attempt at free speech through a number of ways (censorship, funding cuts, etc.), ours is not one of those universities.\n\nWe receive a modest amount from the university, not much by the standards set by some of our big brother schools, but still enough to get by. We also have a killer ads team that sells our paper and other products enough for us to do fun things like pay our staff, travel around the US and launch new products with some degree of regularity. \n\nI'd also mention that every student media at every school is run uniquely. Some are provided with full funding from the university, some are completely independent, some are both (us). So it becomes hard to compare yourself directly with other outlets. Apples to oranges type-deal. Thanks for the question. ",

Solid question. I'll be straight with you and tell you that was a fuck up on our part. We had people working on what you're referring to and other things like it and we just never got the story we wanted. I also agree that plenty of students would like to know about what happens behind closed doors, so to speak, and we'd like to figure it all out. Shitty as it is, sometimes it's better to not run a story than to run an incomplete mess that will do no one any good.

Just kidding, I know it's because y'all got a new head honcho who didn't like the idea. TELL HIM TO BRING IT BACK. It was an awesome tradition.\n\nAlso, how are articles approved? On more than one occasion I've read articles written by your staff which are extraordinarily inappropriate in nature. I know that it was done before your tenure began, but how will you adjust to ensure it doesn't happen in the future? (I'll drill down to the bedrock and say one of the articles I had in mind was written last summer by Marissa, encouraging EIP students to get drunk. What repercussions, if any did she face?)\n\nAs you mentioned earlier, your budget is significantly bigger than some other universities. Have you considered doing away with expensive trips and vacations for your upper staff in order to pay your journalists decently, if at all? ( I hope I'm correct in assuming the policy for not paying a journalist for their first semester is still in place.)\n\nAlso, do you really have to have a gay marriage opinions piece every single semester? I support gay marriage, (I'm gay) but I'm pretty sick of seeing the same old trite opinions trotted out every fall/spring.\n\n\nEdit: The FAFFF event was on point last semester! One thing that's pretty annoying though... the fake little protests that the organizers do every few minutes. You could probably do away with those.\n\nEdit 2: For those interested in reading the article I mentioned. http://thegeorgeanne.com/2013/06/opinions/party-it-up-eip/ ",

I would agree that the article you mentioned was inappropriate and I personally was not a fan of the topic. The only way to avoid writing pieces of that nature is better judgement. You can have a million and one ways to filter through ideas but if you're not competent you'll still look like an idiot. I'm not at liberty to discuss any repercussions, unfortunately, I hope that's not too upsetting.\n\n2.) First of all, we do pay our writers once they're on staff. You're right, though, the first semester is unpaid because that is in essence a tryout and training period (pretty much weeds out the people who aren't dedicated). And to put it bluntly, no, we have no intentions to stop travelling as far as I'm aware. We also do not just send our upper staff, nearly every conference/training seminar we go to there is a sign up process. The trips are valuable to us as an organization for a lot of reasons but I'll narrow it down to networking, training and a marketing tool. At these events we attend our staff gets the chance to talk to media professionals from around the country and exchange numbers, talk about the career field and learn from their experience. These are things we cannot provide them with in Statesboro, so we go elsewhere. And finally the fact we're able to go around and do cool stuff like that makes our organization more marketable. Maybe a potential trip to NYC would be the tipping point for someone who's on the fence, who knows? \n\n3.)100% agree with you here. It's redundant and lame. I'm working with our new Opinions editor to have fresh content that is unique to our paper. \n\nThanks for the compliment! I'll let the event organizers know you liked it, and pass on your criticism. Cheers. ",

I'm glad that you're in a position of power at least and can hopefully serve to mitigate against future articles.\n\nOn point 2:\n\nI'm sorry if I came across as judgmental, I understand the relevance of conferences to different groups when it comes to networking, training, etc. But to my mind, nothing concrete comes of these conferences, whereas an increase in salary for some students would have a pretty big affect on them personally and could help to possibly chip away at their debt. And I think being able to offer pay to people immediately would also help to make your organization more marketable. I know while I was in SGA, I lobbied against us going on our fall retreat because it literally costs thousands of dollars (paid for with student fees) which I felt would be better spent on tangible things for the university and students. This is just my opinion obviously, take it as you will.\n\nand yay for 3! Thanks for the awesome responses. Also, forreal, please tell your new staff supervisor or whatever to bring back the george ain't. It was my absolute favorite.",

It comes with the territory.

And I'm being generous when I call it an opinion, it hardly deserves that moniker. Now, if her article had been about how the drinking age should be changed because of X,Y,Z then by all means that's something worth sharing, but again, I reiterate that her article did none of this. \n\nAnd I never said that it was her fault if people choose to go out and get drunk and don't take their studies seriously; I'm not attributing the actions of EIP students to her. However, that doesn't absolve her of ALL responsibility to act like a professional and to not write stupid stuff. \n\nAnd it wasn't even well written, tbh.",

Essentially, we have a casual form of tryout that will occur during the second or third week of classes that will give us an idea of your current level of writing, among other things. \n\nEveryone who completes our tryout will be interviewed by two current staff members with questions regarding yourself; things like time willing to commit, other organizations affiliated with, past experience, etc. \n\nFollowing this myself and the interviewers speak and narrow down to the people we know have the time to commit to working with us. Once we have our list we slap it up on a big board and the program begins. \n\nOnce a week for about an hour we'll have a sort of class with different speakers to lay the groundwork for the candidates to be successful. Think things like newsgathering, interviewing, ethics, law, that kind of stuff. \n\nThat will last most of the semester. While attending the sessions you'll also join a section (News, Arts &amp; Entertainment, Sports, Digital) and begin writing stories for them. You're required to write four stories throughout that candidate semester, which, frankly, is easy as shit. \n\nThen, whoever finishes the semester with the proper number of stories written and good attendance to the classes is considered to come on to staff. I will be honest and say most people who make it to the end do end up joining the staff because it is such a heavy time commitment to get nothing tangible out of. \n\nThose who are approved are then permitted to participate in our staff application period where they may apply for a number of jobs within our organization. \n\nSo that's that. Forgive me for being long winded but I too like writing a bit. \n\nThanks for the question!\n",

We look at the lot and select the ones we think ya'll will want to know about most. Of course we don't always get this right, it's excruciatingly difficult. Every person is different and the student body reacts in different ways than we would've thought to many stories. \n\nSo, yeah, that's basically it. We just look at what's available or things we would want to know, find that stuff out and write a couple hundred words about it. \n\nI'll also say that I love every person that sends me a good story idea. If you want something figured out, explained, investigated, extrapolated upon or whatever else shoot us an email and we'll  look into it and potentially write a story on it. ",

I know there are a ton of really cool niche student organizations that do some pretty interesting stuff the trouble is hearing about that stuff.

If they can shake it off on a weekly basis, I'm sure a system as strong and unified as greek life can manage to get over a two-year old slight.",

Of course there is always room for more in every organization, and we're always looking for that, but I'm not unhappy with where we're at now. \n\n",

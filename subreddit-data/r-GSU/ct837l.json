    "postText": "So I'm a new graduate student that just moved to the area, and I'm looking to get involved with some clubs or organizations to meet new people. This is probably a stupid question, but are grad students allowed/welcome to participate in undergraduate organizations? \n\nI'd love to get involved with a few of them, but I don't want it to be weird with me mingling with undergrads. I wouldn't really broadcast that I'm a grad student unless I was asked about it, so it might not matter to begin with. I'm pretty new to the whole post-undergrad scene (and GSU as a whole), so literally everything is new to me.\n\nThanks in advance :-)",

Is the previous contingency plan still relevant, or do we not have one in case things go awry?\n\nI can't skip this semester now since it's my last, but seeing how the last two semesters went, I'm pretty optimistic.",

My supervisors told us that the main plan is to either tell people who catch covid to go back to their Home Homes, or if you can\u2019t do that they\u2019ll just transport you to the Savannah campus to quarantine since there\u2019s no room in on campus housing for them to quarantine you since they\u2019re overpacked. And by overpacked I mean they boughtout 40 rooms at eagles nest and are also turning different lounges in places like watson, Kennedy, and CP into rooms to pack people in.",

And where are the Armstrong students supposed to quarantine if needed?\n\nI'm not saying we need to go completely online, but would it kill the university to have hybrid classes at least? The schools are so obsessed with keeping their revenue that it pisses me off.",

And when we (The RAs) pressured them about it all they did was give us PR responses (as if they have no morals or human decency). But the one thing they did say is that \u201cthey\u2019re following the CDC and US government\u2019s protocols\u201d so it\u2019s essentially catch covid and get over it or get vaccinated( which most won\u2019t) because it\u2019s not flipping anytime soon\ud83d\ude2d",

It is going to be really annoying having to go through this shit again being kicked off campus. I really wish they didn\u2019t go back to normal operating procedures.

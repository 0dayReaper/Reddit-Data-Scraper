    "postText": "Hey everyone, we're trying to bring the International &amp; American Student Alliance (IASA), a student organization at multiple universities across the country, to GSU and one of its biggest programs is English Clusters. This program provides free, non-credit English as a Second Language (ESL) workshops &amp; conversation hours to international students who want to practice/improve their English skills in a casual environment. These are typically led by students who are native (or at least near-fluent) English speakers and interested in volunteering to assist international students and/or gaining teaching experience.\n\nCluster topics can range anywhere from skill-based (i.e. pronunciation) to topic-based (i.e. American movies) to casual conversation-based (i.e. discussion of current events, practicing English by playing games). While the volunteer opportunities in this program are great for those studying to become English/ESL teachers or wanting to teach abroad, we still welcome those who are not. The type of Cluster that you would be able to lead (a more casual conversation hour format vs. one on pronunciation) will depend on your background, knowledge, and experience, but anyone from freshmen to graduate students can participate.\n\nFor the Spring, all of these Clusters will be virtual and go from February through April. Clusters meet once a week for around an hour and there's a lot of flexibility for the day/time that they can be led. In addition to these Clusters being open to all international students at GSU, we're combining the English Clusters across all of the universities that our organization is at (i.e. Georgia Tech, UGA, Kennesaw State, etc.) this Spring since most things are virtual anyway. This means that an international student here can participate in a Cluster led by someone at a different university, and vice-versa.\n\nIf leading one of the Clusters for this program sounds like something you might be interested in, visit uiasaa.com or dm me for more information!",

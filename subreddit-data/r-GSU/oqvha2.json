I don\u2019t want to give out specific financial information or anything like that. I just want to know if you guys have anywhere that is good, relevant to your experience. My parents/reviews are really difficult to be trusted.\n\nThank you!",

It's a little pricey, but its amenities might be worth it for you. If you don't have a roommate, you better find one, don't let them randomly match you or you'll end up with two underage drinkers like I did. \n\nI knew friends who lived in Cambridge, it's okay and not too far from campus, but it's not in the safest area. Wifi can be hit or miss. Also, it has carpet which is a pain to maintain. Overall, it's a decent affordable option and they still have decent amenities",

When we first moved in, it was a complete shit hole where there were cigarette burns in the couch and it was just nasty. Not all units are bad, but it depends on the previous tenants.\n\nThen, last year my roommates and I wanted to move into a 3 bedroom on the newer side of copper, we signed and were promised we would get the new side. Fast forward to this week and our assigned unit is on the old side. Copper isn't a bad place in certain areas, but management is all over the place. \n\nMonarch seems okay if youre into a dorm-building apartment, the Vault has had a lot of shootings and isn't great as you've probably heard. Axis seems okay, Cambridge seems good. The haptons and axis look nice but are a little pricey.",

I remember when they announced that they were going to change the name and gave use all t-shirts and thinking that the new name was dumb.\n\nHow is that place these days? I really miss getting out of class and cutting through sweetheart circle to walk back home. When I was there I had some pretty scary neighbors. Especially the woman who would smoke crack and throw up in her yard everyday. That was always a lovely sight to see leaving my apartment for my 8AMs.",

    "postText": "I haven't been in any of the arts or music buildings on campus, and don't know anyone who's in any of those majors so I have no one to ask this of. \n\nI'd really like to record some lyrics I've written for my personal use, but I live with family and they are always home and tbh I'm too weirded out/embarrassed to sing or anything when they would 100% hear me lol. But I also don't have the money to rent any kind of practice space or recording studio time elsewhere in town, and figured maybe there were some kind of spaces like this on campus that I could reserve for an amount of time (like an hour or something) as a student. I don't need recording studio equipment, I'll just record with my own devices, but I just want to be somewhere where I don't have to feel so embarrassed thinking about that people can hear me lol, hence why I'd prefer some kind of lil sound proofed space or something. Something similar to reserving the library study rooms, but it's for practicing music or performance.",

(That\u2019s how most places are at least).\n\nAs far as renting, I\u2019m not aware of anywhere that actually does this. I think it\u2019s just first come first serve. Honestly just walk up in the music area and see what the situation is and don\u2019t be afraid to ask someone for access if they have it.\n\nAnd lastly, I\u2019ll just warn you that the practice rooms are not soundproof!! You can hear people practicing inside. So unfortunately people might here you sing (although don\u2019t be embarrassed because I\u2019m sure you have a great voice!)\n\nSorry I can\u2019t be of more help, but this is just some general information I know from most places I have been",

A lot of the other classroom buildings have department offices in them, and usually some rooms there will have their doors open and it's easy to just pop in and ask anyone there stuff if you need to. I'm sure the music building probably has an area or offices in it like that too with staff or profs there that I can ask info from.",

                    "comment": "Oh dang...yea, probably because they have instruments or stuff like that in the rooms so they lock them for safety/to not get stuff stolen or anything, which makes sense. I'm probably going to have to find someone who uses the building on Armstrong to see if there's a way to be able to let myself into a practice room or something. \n\nAre you taking piano lessons? I took them as a kid, but quit early on because learning to read music was completely ruining it for me lol, but I've been thinking a lot the past few years of trying to take lessons again if I can find someone who's willing to teach me without a focus on reading music, and might just find a prof or student on campus who could just teach me there if Armstrong has piano rooms too.",

I know some of the labs at armstrong have no food/drink rules and you have to leave any of that stuff on a table outside the room. \n\nI mostly just enjoy making up my own sort of stuff when I play instruments (though it would be nice to eventually be able to teach myself how to play covers, and I love classical music and soundtracks and orchestral stuff, but I doubt I'd ever be able to play that sort of stuff haha), but I don't really know anything about proper form or technique or anything like that, and I'm not good at my hands doing a different thing each at the same time lol, so usually when I try to play I kind of stay in one place/sound and kinda struggle to change it up how one would need to during playing or writing a song. \n\nHaven't tried to learn to read music since I was like 7 or 8 so I'd try again and see how it goes. I just remember it being like trying to learn math and a foreign language at the same time, and both of those are hard enough on their own, and anything like math tends to just make my brain shut down and not have a good time lol. But I love playing around with sound and making pretty sounds a lot, and even when I don't know what I'm doing with an instrument or a music app I can still sit with it for hours and just make sound, so learning music as a kid just kinda messed that up for me (I guess similar to what being forced to read for school does to reading for fun for a lot of folks, where it can just kinda make it not as enjoyable anymore).",

    "postText": "Currently a history major, thinking of doing music (history and lit version) as a minor.\n\nI only really know about how a music major or minor can be like when from a performing arts department at any school. I have no clue what a history and lit/humanities department version of a music minor would be like, or how it would be different from a performing arts version of the subject. \n\nI'm interested in the history and culture and theories and applications of music, but am not really interested in learning to read music notation, or in learning how to play instruments in an academic setting (don't mind this as a hobby at my own pace, but no interest in learning instruments in school, sorry lol). If I go to grad school in the future I'm hoping to try and study ethnomusicology, or if I don't go to grad school, to still work in that field somehow, or behind the scenes in the music industry.\n\nWhat do you learn in this minor? Is it different from a performing arts department version of the music minor? Will I have to learn to read music and play instruments? Or is it more about music history and culture/writing about or things written about music?\n\nAlso has anyone from Armstrong/Savannah taken this minor, even though it is only offered at Statesboro? Are the classes usually offered online, or no? Is it hard to schedule around the shuttle times if you're having to take the shuttle back and forth between Savannah and Statesboro? Does it feel worth it when you're spending 5hrs a day on a bus, just to attend one \\~60min class? (I take the bus to/from home and Armstrong campus, so there would be even an extra hour of bus ride time tacked on for me to get to/from the Savannah campus to catch the shuttle from there and then get home from there, taking it from 4hr shuttle ride, to an overall 5hrs sitting on a bus total). \n\nI really want to minor in this, but there is another minor I'm thinking about as well which is offered at Armstrong, so I'm just wondering if the music minor would be worth it for me having to commute like that for the classes.",

I would email Greg Harwood with any questions. He is one of our music history professors and the main advisor for masters students.\n\nHis email is: gharwood@georgiasouthern.edu\n\nHope this helps! I am also very interested in music history. Although I don\u2019t know if you will get away with not learning about notation lol (it\u2019s a huge deal in music history!)",

I've tried this many times since I was a little kid, and it has never worked for me and just makes me frustrated to the extreme any time I try and I know for sure it would just make me hate the subject/school overall if I was having to try and learn to play music from notation. But don't mind learning how to read it without having to actually translate it to playing an instrument (though Idk if this makes sense?). I've got dysclaculia lol so working through translating one thing into another thing in my head (whether numbers to a math problem/solution, or an analog clock into an actual 00:00 sort of time, or one language into another, etc) is kinda impossible to do at anything but a hella slow pace (like I could probably play a piece of music from reading sheet music...but only at like !% normal speed or something). But I love messing around with instruments and making music in a freestyle sort of way without having to read/write music along with it. \n\nThank you!! Will email him.",

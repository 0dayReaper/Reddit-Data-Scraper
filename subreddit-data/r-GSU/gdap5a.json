Allowing elected city officials to hold alcohol licenses.\n\n  \nThese two go hand in hand in regards to this issue - and if you wonder WHY are these two being pushed for simultaneously? The answer is the mayor Johnathan McCollar recently purchased a venue at 39-A West Main Street. He claims its a place for birthday parties, and wedding receptions and not a bar but it doesn't take a detective to see what's happening. If these two are passed hand in hand it will likely stretch down West Main all the way to Eagle Creek as they attempt to \"Savannah-ify\" down town while using his political influence to fill his pockets.",

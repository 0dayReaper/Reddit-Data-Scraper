    "postText": "They're offering a manufacturing engineering internship, I'm just skeptical of it because it's unpaid.\n\nEdit: I had an interview just after I made this post with the founder of RM. Very nice dude, has a lot of experience with different industries. Given that it's a startup, it makes sense why they're doing unpaid internships. I'm hoping that if I land it, I can eventually get a paid position with the company, and he has some neat ways that he's running his business model.",

Im not sure how itd be for the engineering internship so take this with a grain of salt. Good Luck!",

Even if you can afford to not be paid, I still wouldn't take one because it doesn't seem like a good deal. A part time job will help you pay bills and also provide experience.\n\nThe \"getting paid in credits\" argument isn't really valid, because (at least for my major) an internship isn't required for graduation.",

Although Rolling Monkey has good people running it and my buddy enjoyed his internship there. I think they mainly use it as a way to help students get some experience under their belt.\n\nMy advice would be to hold out for a paid internship especially since having one isn't required for graduation. Look into Gulfstream if thats your thing or other places in Savannah for summer internships.",

This internship is for next spring, I can't get a summer one without taking a semester off. I need to graduate soon.\n\nI've applied to like 6 Gulfstream internships and only got 1 interview with them, which is a shame because I think they're a neat company. Oh well. But I'm gonna be open minded and take whatever I can get.",

Aerospace is an extremely volatile engineering field.\n\nAnd in case you were wondering, the Rolling Monkey internship doesn't sound promising. He won't even give me college credit, so it doesn't sound like he would respect people's time. Don't do it unless it's your absolute last option.",

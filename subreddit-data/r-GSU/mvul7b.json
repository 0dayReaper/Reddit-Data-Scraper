            "comment": "Lakeside is definitely better than landrum but there are fewer selections at lakeside. I suspect it may have something to do with the quality/quantity relationship. As a freshman I only went to lakeside for dinner (because I think it is the only one open for dinner) &amp; I could usually find something good to eat. It gets repetitive a lot quicker than I thought it would so having a dorm with a kitchen where I could heat up soup or a frozen pizza or frozen lasagna was really really nice. There is a salad bar in landrum but it is pretty weak. The fried chicken isn\u2019t bad if you use enough sauce. Most of the food is southern cuisine because that\u2019s what most people in the south like (duh)\u2014 not the healthiest. \n\nEdit: more info",

Financially, while not the absolute best because it isn't all you can eat like it used to be, it's still better than the retail locations on campus (where $8.75 won't even get you a drink and a cheap processed sandwich).\nIf they do make it all you can eat again next semester then come on days where you have a big time gap and/or lots of zoom classes. You can stay for basically the whole day and they won't kick you out.",

            "comment": "Honestly the food is pretty good. However, it is extremely repetitive. It gets old really fast. \n\nLakeside has better tasting food hands down. However they are only open from 7:00 am to 3:00 pm. \n\nLandrum has double or triple the options that lakeside has but they don\u2019t taste nearly as good. Landrum is open from 10:30 am to 9 pm.  Landrum also has an allergy section where the food is free of the top 9 or 10 allergens. \n\nI will say that the best things to eat at Landrum is the pasta bar and burrito line. They also having amazing turkey burgers. \n\nLakeside has better fried chicken and homestyle cooking along with a better sandwich bar.\n\nI\u2019m a current freshman so feel free to dm me if you have any more questions",

            "comment": "As others have said, Lakeside has more variety of healthy options and they taste better. They have all sorts of fruit, sweet potato fries, occasionally whole wheat pasta, asparagus, broccolini, and other foods.\n\nHowever, please don't go into either there or Landrum with high expectations. All the food is definitely edible, but I wouldn't even put it above your average buffet restaurant. And it sickens me that they still charge what they do even during the pandemic, and it's not all you can eat anymore afaik.\n\nAs a freshman, make the most of it. You'll enjoy not having to cook or do dishes for your first year, but I would look forward to eating better, cheaper food you can make yourself when you have your own kitchen in your apartment/house.",

I'm transferring to the Statesboro campus in January for the Spring semester, and it looks like applying for January instead of August is a bit tricky.",

They moved me into an apartment with fleas and didn't really care. I had to fight to get moved to a different apartment and then the new one had a severe roach infestation, like flick a light on and they all scatter. I also lived there the year they had so many armed robberies, that they stopped sending eagle alerts, because the amount of eagle alerts going out was scaring students and parents and they were contacting the university about it.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m in a military family so we move too often and I never learned how to ride a bike. A lot of the places we moved to were also too snowy for a bike and so I never had the opportunity to learn. I\u2019m transferring to GSU for Fall 2021 and wondering if there\u2019s any way to learn how to ride a bike on campus? I found that you can rent a bike on campus but I wouldn\u2019t be able to really use it... any suggestions?",

Lots of people get to college, realize they don't know how do something they think is very basic, start worrying about it like you are, and then get people to help them. I have several friends who learned to drive from other friends, for instance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe go to the RAC? They have a bike shop in the back and they offer lessons on all kinds of outdoorsy things, so maybe they can help.",

Just practice getting on the seat and pushing off with both legs with a good bit of force and practice keeping the bike upright while it's in motion. Then when you are comfy with that start pedaling. Remember the faster you pedal, the more the bike will want to stay upright.",

I taught her how to cook, and she taught me how to really deep clean an apartment.\n\nWe were both brought up differently so we had things we were used to doing and things that we had never done before. \n\nMy parents had a maid come every week so I never had to mop, sweep, vacuum, clean toilets or any of that. What I did have to do was cook dinner each night and pack lunches for myself and my siblings for the next day because both of my parents worked late. \n\nMy roommate had been doing chores since she could walk but had never stepped foot in the kitchen because her mom was a stay at home mom and cooked 3 meals a day for them.",

            "comment": "I agree either asking friends or Southern Adventures at the RAC, on the backside (you can either access it through the RAC or at its own separate entrance in the back). They are the ones who run the Campus Cycle program. The people there are outdoorsy, extremely friendly students! If you can't find any friends to teach you, I suggest going there and explaining never learning and asking if they could teach you. It would take 30 minutes or less and you'd get the hang of it. Their parking lot is secluded, so if you were worried about having an audience, that wouldn't be a concern there.  Alternatively, I will be coming back for my Master's Degree at GSU, I will be on campus the first week prior to classes starting. My boyfriend and I would be happy to teach you, we have a men's and women's bike.",

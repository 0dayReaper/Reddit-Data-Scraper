    "postText": "Hey, few quick questions. So I applied and got accepted as a transfer to GSU, I signed up for a transfer visit last week for tomorrow. I was told I would receive an email with more information in regards to parking and such the day before (today) and have yet to receive it. Has anyone gotten theirs, or didn\u2019t but was fine when they went?\n\nAlso, due to the weather being terrible tomorrow and this weekend, will the tour be canceled? I love 3.5 hours away and would hate to get there to be told it\u2019s canceled and have to drive right back\u2026\n\nAnyone information or point of contendr\u00e1 would be great!\n\nThanks!",

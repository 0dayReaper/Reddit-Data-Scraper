GA southern\u2019s wifi is worse than McDonalds. I literally can\u2019t do schoolwork that the university expects me to do on the internet that they provide.",

They've told me all they can do is negotiate the contract, because all the issues are due to contracted terms with stupid businessmen. They told me it'd be better around december, hopefully",

I don\u2019t wanna hear anything about too many people being on the wifi this school is small in comparison to many other schools. It\u2019s just laziness on Southerns part.",

I knew there were a few robberies.\n\nBut despite that, neither me nor any of my friends ever had any issues. And we weren't exactly acting safe all the time. I'd walk through there alone, blackout drunk, way past closing time. Leaving our door unlocked. All kinds of stuff like that.\n\nNone of us ever had an issue. Multiple of us had issues with kids coming from on-campus housing while walking to or from the plaza, including being robbed or attacked.\n\nOn top of that, even neighbors I didn't know at all would be extremely helpful, and it felt like everyone in my building looked out for each other, regardless of knowing each other or not. Nobody snitched, despite some shady stuff going on in various apartments. And nothing ever happened in that building during the entire time. I think I was there for roughly 3 years all in all, always in the same building.\n\nI've lived in a lot of places and various countries. I've been attacked in 'safe' areas. Despite being a crazy area at the time, it also felt like a really great community. I loved my time there.\n\nTo be fair, I left before the clowns came afaik. That shit was creepy, haha.",

I already have one science lab credit from making a 4 on the AP chem exam but I need another science lab and eventually a PE class. \nI just really want to know the easiest science labs bc it isn\u2019t my major and I don\u2019t want the class to be consuming. Any suggestions would help. \nAdditionally any easy PE\u2019s. I was thinking of taking golf just bc I own clubs but if you know anything about that class or any easy PE\u2019s that would be good.",

Bowling was really easy in my experience. Golf is good if you have a ride to the golf course (which means you need extra time to get to and from there). \n\nScience... Is dependent on how you view science as a whole. I think Biology is the easiest, but I like biology. I would stay away from Chemistry (math heavy) and Physics (math heavy). Geology (earth science) was a fan favorite, but that also might have been dependent on the teacher. (Maybe check ratemyprofessor?)\n\nEnvironmental biology is also pretty easy, but that goes back to how you feel about biology itself. All of the lab classes are pretty involved, just as the nature is of a lab class. I think you're given about a two hour block for a lab? But it's once a week.",

You can just sync your steps with Google Fit. The app we had to use was really really terrible, but you can work around it. If you really want you could just fake all the steps and you would pass.",

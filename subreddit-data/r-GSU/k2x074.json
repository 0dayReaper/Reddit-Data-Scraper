The accrediting issue is apparently based on mandate, not option, and we have been given the option. \n\nBased on that, me and most of the faculty in our department are going online-only for the last week and finals.",

Obviously the school wants to make as much profit as they can, as well, though I guess it's not the only reason they're staying as live as possible.\n\nI find it so, so infuriating that our mechanical engineering department isn't offering a *single* course online for next spring. Not even the lecture-based ones. Anybody care to explain why?",

Not even the lecture-based ones. Anybody care to explain why?\n\nNext semester's lack of online classes was based on a mandate handed down from the Georgia Board of Regents. They told all the state's public universities and colleges that we cannot offer a higher percentage of online classes in Spring 2021 than we offered in Spring 2020. The president and provost have expressed that they too are frustrated about that and think it's nonsensical, but they can't go against the BOR. \n\nI get pissy at Marrero and Reiber about a lot of things, but they presented data to the BOR that clearly showed that even before COVID-19, demand for online classes at Southern has been trending upwards for a decade, and offering more online classes has correlated with increased enrollment. Enrollment is the lifeblood of the school. Y'all paying tuition (Which, I get, also sucks) is how we make enough money to keep the lights on and keep folks like me paid to teach kids like you. \n\nCapping online classes is shooting ourselves in the foot, but the BOR doesn't care. The BOR are almost exclusively political appointees put into the position by conservative governors, so they're going to do whatever the political winds call for.",

That's an unfounded decision, they need to keep up with the times, both short term and long term.\n\nAlso, I appreciate the insider knowledge you're able to provide to this subreddit.",

It's important to keep in mind that the university makes decisions based on confirmed cases, and confirmed cases are only when the on-campus Health Center does the test or the local GPH testing site does it and the person being tested tells the testers that they are a Southern student. \n\nThis upcoming Monday's numbers will be from Thanksgiving week, and I doubt many students got tested during Thanksgiving week.",

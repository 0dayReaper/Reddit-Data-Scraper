Imagine all of the students anticipating live classes this fall, only for them to get fucked at the last minute after the school switches. All of those people living off campus will be at the mercy of their landlords paying for rent with no chance of cancellation. How shitty of them.\n\nAs of right now, I won't be going back to GSU, but I'm still registered for this fall in case they decide to switch to online classes.\n\nAnd it's not just the virus that scares me, but also the potential for violent protests to erupt in Statesboro.",

I don\u2019t foresee that being any violent stuff happening bc Statesboro is Statesboro. \n\nBut yeah I really hope the admins communicate something to the students because I really think they\u2019re being entirely too hasty on the assumption that they can handle outbreaks. I really just think they said live (in-person) classes would be a thing to keep enrollment prospects up.",

I only think there's a possibility because a lot of GSU students are from Atlanta and surrounding areas, and Atlanta is having some major protests going on right now. The more degenerate students might bring their violence to campus.\n\nIf they really want to keep enrollment up, then they should make classes online. It might not be the best for learning, but you'll have way more people who will be able to at least take the classes. A lot of students are out of state or international, so it would be harder for them to come back to campus depending on their state's or country's policies.",

I really don\u2019t think students from ATL will cause any violence. We all know that the three law enforcement agencies that are present in this area will do something about it if it gets crazy. \n\nI think GA really fucked itself bc Kemp wanted shit open ASAP. I really don\u2019t know how they\u2019re gonna pull this off.",

Literally I'd rather prefer to know if we're doing online or not because I am not about to do a fucking switch halfway through a damn Calculus class next semester. It's so obvious they just want to keep enrollment up, that way as soon as the deadline to drop out without consequences passed, they can steal the people's fucking money. Like just tell us that we're not gonna be in person, don't try to hide it because people will be incredibly angry.",

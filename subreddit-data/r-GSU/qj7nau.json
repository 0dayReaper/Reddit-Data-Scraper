    "postText": "I\u2019m a junior transferring in the spring. I read that all new students have to go through soar which is fine, however I\u2019m not comfortable with an advisor making my schedule. Is there anyway to get around this? I want to register with all the other juniors and make my own schedule. I\u2019m mainly scared about classes I need getting filled up and being set behind bc my advisor wasn\u2019t fast enough or just doesn\u2019t care.",

I had a professor that assigned a text book she wrote and made us pay $60. \n\nTips that you may already know\u2014 go to class and see if the professor actually requires the book. Only about half of the professors actually did. They just left a book listed on the syllabus. Also if you find the book but it\u2019s an older edition, it will most likely work. I used a book for my masters class that was 2 editions before and all that was different was page numbers. \n\nGood luck and GATA!",

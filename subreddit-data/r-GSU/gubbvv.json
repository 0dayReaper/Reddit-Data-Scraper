    "postText": "Is the Armstrong campus lively? Is it a commuter school, or do most people taking classes there live on campus? How is the social/party scene? What types of things are popular on that campus (Clubs, sports, orgs etc.)? Is it known as an artsy place? I'm very interested in it as I'd love to study in Savannah and it's the only affordable public college there.",

            "comment": "It is a commuter school. It is not as lively as the Statesboro campus by a long shot but it is getting better. Partying is possible there but a lot of people in your classes are going to be driving back home to their parents afterwards so it\u2019s a different atmosphere. \n\nSource: went to The Armstrong campus for two years while I lived at home then transferred to the Statesboro campus for the last two years. My sister did the same thing.",

With SCAD also in Savannah, Armstrong isn\u2019t really considered super artsy, but there are definitely artsy majors and clubs on campus. It wasn\u2019t my first pick, but was definitely affordable, and I\u2019ve come to really enjoy Armstrong! If you decide to go here, I really hope you enjoy it as well!",

            "comment": "I stayed for one semester and enjoyed Armstrong.  If you want an artsy place it is fairly close to downtown Savannah and you can take the public bus down to the area for fairly cheap (the last time I was there).  There is an art school also nearby in the Savannah Mall.  Unfourtanetly, it may be better to start in Statesboro as an art major because most (if not all) art-related major courses are in Statesboro.  This will exclude art education and art history, which are available on both campuses.",

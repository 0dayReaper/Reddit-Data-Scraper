It\u2019s worth a shot to look at apartments and as them about the fees for cancelation bc in reality you\u2019re probably not going to get a spot if you haven\u2019t gotten one already. It\u2019s also probably going to still be cheaper if you only pay for a couple months and cancel your lease depending on the complex.",

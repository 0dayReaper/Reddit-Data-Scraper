Workload isnt too crazy just do the reading guides before every class for the reading quiz and you should be good.\n\nTests are straight from the lecture and just quote identification.",

In class you go over sciencey and nutritional stuff like what is a starch and how does sugar react when being digested. Quizzes were like how many ounces in a cup, what are good fats, what are bad fats. And the tests were just a few quizzes together. This was in 2014.\nEdit: I graduated with an IT degree and a minor in criminal justice.",

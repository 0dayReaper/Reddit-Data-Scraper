I think it emphasizes SOUTHERN which is where our best marketing angle is.\n\n\nAlso, Georgia State has a really great ball club. Good for them, representing the Sun Belt well. Credibility for the Sun Belt works in our favor too in the long run.\n\nAlso, I still hate their ridiculous football program and can't wait for them to get that ass whopped in Statesboro this year.

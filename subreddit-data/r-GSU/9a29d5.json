I\u2019ve found myself isolated in this city surrounded by App State fans and would love to get a little piece of Eagle Nation together! \n",

I\u2019ll definitely be planning something for at least a couple of the games this year and I\u2019d love to have you, even if it\u2019s just the two of us haha. We\u2019re definitely outnumbered here so it\u2019ll be nice to find some Eagle Nation family up here",

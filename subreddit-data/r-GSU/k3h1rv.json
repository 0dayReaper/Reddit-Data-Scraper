However, with the covid hybrid class situation, all my classes this semester don't care if you come in class and can attend all classes through zoom. So, in a sense, a hybrid class can be all online.",

I guess I would have to only show up for exams in person.\n\nI was signed up for a full load earlier this fall, but dropped everything within the first week since the profs couldn't work with me enough to have me take it remotely. But at least they tried.",

My professors mostly all agree to doing open book exams, time limited to class period, but your camera must be on, for zoom call. I've had no issues with that format.",

I have some labs which obviously require me to be in person, but I think they're also held virtually every other week.\n\nCS is hands on, but can be done through a computer obviously, so going virtual isn't as big a deal. Mech E and similar majors have lots of labs involving physical experiments, so going virtual for those will change the quality of those courses (at least, that's what the department says).",

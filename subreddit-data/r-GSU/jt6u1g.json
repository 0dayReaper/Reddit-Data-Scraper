    "postText": "I know UGA and lots of other colleges aren't making their students go back to campus after Thanksgiving break, but of course Southern is, as of now, making us. Has anyone heard any rumors or mumblings about whether that will change? Cases in the U.S. are horrific and I know lots of people who go here outside of GA, it's ridiculously incompetent to send everyone home and think they won't do things with family, and then have everyone come back together. \n\nI don't put my money on our administration doing anything even halfway humane so I say we come back.",

We were told that it was an accreditation issue, that based on the calendar we are on, missing a week would get us in trouble with a bunch of our college-level accrediting board because of time-in-classroom mandates. We were never given an explanation about why other state schools were doing it. \n\nAt the dean level, we have been told that going online after Thanksgiving is a don't-ask-don't-tell situation. Most of my department is going online-only after Thanksgiving, but not everyone.",

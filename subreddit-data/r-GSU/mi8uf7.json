What's the biggest class you've had?\n\nAlso, if I'm in a huge class, can I get proper help if I need it?\n\nThank you",

Make sure to let them know who you are and what class are you taking. Once u get to ur major classes, class size is pretty small is common to see the same group of people. Major classes is when u actually have the chance to get to know your professor",

    "postText": "Hey y'all, I'm a 26 y/o male professional looking at potentially relocating to Statesboro soon. My company in the Atlanta area is moving our operations to Swainsboro and frankly, nothing about Swainsboro is appealing and Statesboro is kind of close by.   \n\n\nI'm looking for nice apartment options (likely with roommates) in town, but am finding a lot of them (the nice looking ones anyway) seem to be student-oriented off-campus housing. I wouldn't mind living in a place like that, but it doesn't seem like that's really an option if you aren't an active student.   \n\n\nJust wondering if anyone has advice (or even leads on people needing a roommate) as to what places to look into. I'm a corporate pilot and work on an 8-on/6-off rotation, meaning I'm gone the full 8 days and only home less than half of the time. This is largely why I'm not so interested in getting a place on my own just to be home a fraction of the time.    \n\n\nFWIW: I'm a college grad (Middle GA-Aviation, transferred in from William &amp; Mary). I don't have any pets, but don't mind them. I'm relatively quiet, but I'll drink and have a good time and don't mind noise or parties. I'm a little anal about cleaning but don't mind picking up after people in general. My budget is flexible.   \n\n\nThanks for any help!",

There are a lot of families that live in the complex, so it definitely isn't completely geared toward students. Plus, these are three-story townhomes (mine is, anyway), so it isn't like living in a cramped apartment with a bunch of other people. It's pretty chill.",

            "comment": "If you call some and they dont have rooms available there are a couple of subleasing pages on facebook that people use to post their rooms (georgia southern subleasing for example). Most are for the full year (august-july) and some are 6 month leases. From what i\u2019ve seen a good portion of them have roommates and the rents run between $350-500 per room depending on the complex. A lot of complexes will probably ask you student oriented questions because of it being a college town but theres very few that are student only so you have plenty of options! Good luck to you!",

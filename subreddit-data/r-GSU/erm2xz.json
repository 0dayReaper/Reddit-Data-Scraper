    "postText": "TL;DR: Title says it all. Not trying to make a rant, just some thoughts.\n\nSo I'm a senior here at GSU (MechE major), but only by credits through DE. This semester is my third at GSU, and for the most part, it's great. Most of my classes have been great, there's so many helpful resources I have access to for whatever I need, the campus is beautiful, and the food doesn't completely suck.\n\nHowever, one thing that I've really had an issue with is having consistent friends. My first semester (Fall 2018) started off strong at first. I was getting to know a lot of guys and girls alike (mostly freshmen) and clicking with them. Within a few weeks, however, nearly all of those people I met would gradually stop socializing with me, and I'd have awkward encounters with them. They would all fall into their own groups and interests. Even if we had the same interests, they would all end up hanging out with others because they were more interesting or whatever.\n\nI've never really fit into one specific group growing up. IMO, I don't fit in with the upperclassmen that well because I didn't know them as freshmen. At the same time, I rarely saw the freshmen because I wasn't taking the same classes as them, making me unrelatable to them. It's a very awkward place to be in.\n\nIn addition, I've found that lots of people here aren't that fond of casual conversation with strangers. Everyone is very much to themselves unless it's with someone they already know. I've had success in other places with casual conversation; I'm not a shy person. It's just that this school in particular feels very cliquey and it's hard for me to find the type of people I get along with (introverts).\n\nFor at least 1 semester, I've tried out:\n\n\\- Eagle Motorsports\n\n\\- Tau Beta Pi\n\n\\- Pi Tau Sigma\n\n\\- American Foundry Society\n\n\\- Going to the Russell Union Theater movies\n\n\\- Nessmith-Lane Center events\n\n\\- Various small social gatherings\n\nI've had short-term to no success with all of these. I'm mad about TBP and PTS in particular because of the expensive dues. Eagle Motorsports was also expensive and very time-consuming. I got some useful skills out of it, but the team saw how hard-working I was and would just use me for projects while the others would do their own thing.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to share my thoughts. Let me know if there's something I'm doing wrong or if you've felt the same way.\n\nThanks for reading.",

            "comment": "I graduated from the ME department 2 years ago, I don't know what classes you are in but for me the last year I was there was pretty wholesome in the classes, we all banded together to help each other out. \n\nI was on EMS for the good chunk of my time at GSU and was captain of the baja team my junior year (had to step away for my 4th and 5th senior years so I could graduate lol, like you said shit is time consuming as hell). I want to apologize on behalf of the team if they made you feel unwelcome. It can be extremely clicky on the team at times. It took me pretty much all of my freshman year for them to really open up and become friends. It's an extremely high stress environment for the super dedicated guys as there is way way more than just building a car to take care of for them and people tend to get left out or forgotten about and that sucks HARD, but I promise you if you were working hard and getting shit done for the team that they appreciated it.  I don't know if Jordan/ Rahual/ or Chase are still there (I think they should be) but if they are I promise you they are good guys and are always open to helping you find something that works for you. I hope you consider heading back into caruth, It's an EXTREMELY valuable program and it's what got me the job I'm at now.  \n\nEMS can really really suck sometimes but my best memoirs from my time at GSU come from being on that team and I would embrace all the suck again if it meant I got to go hang out with my EMS fam again, I met my best man for my wedding on that team.",

He's been pretty overwhelmed in general from what I've seen, but friendly.\n\nI have thermo, materials science, mechanism and machine design with Jordan. I said hi to him on the first day of thermo (last Monday) and he just straight up ignored me. I'm very confused by this. I wouldn't say we were ever close, but we were never in any conflict. He used to greet me and he even had me over his house with friends for a beer one time.\n\nBut I'm not gonna let that bother me. He's just one of many people that I've met that have moved on in life and don't talk to me for one reason or another. Best of luck to all of them.\n\nI was born and raised in Georgia, but if you met me irl, then you wouldn't know it. I'm not a redneck, I'm social but not extroverted. I probably don't relate to them enough, and that's ok.",

Mind you this is after submitting it in multiple times (though email &amp; GAFutures). I do me the requirements to be accepted with everything else. I only cut them slack because I was emailed that they\u2019re understaffed which meant it\u2019ll take a while for everything to be reviewed. But I was wondering if I was the only one?",

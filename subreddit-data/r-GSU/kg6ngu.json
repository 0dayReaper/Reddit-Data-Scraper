My alma mater\u2019s (Jefferson High School) football team made the playoffs and yesterday they travelled to Savannah for the final four game. On the way down, they stopped at Georgia Southern and practiced in Paulson!!! It was a strange feeling but it was pretty cool seeing my two worlds combined, haha.",

    "postText": "I have to blow off some steam guys. Now, of course this does not apply to all of the students here- let me just put that out there. But I have to say that I am so damn sick of the \"this school is just ok\" attitude. I heard some mopey little fuck bitching to his friend the other day about how it wasn't his first choice, and he would rather be anywhere else...THEN FUCKING GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! I am tired of people who go to this school clinging by the skin around their shaft to everything the goddamn Georgia Bulldog are up to. Fuck UGA. I mean if you honestly love that school so much, why didn't you try harder to go there? Stop acting like we are second rate. GSU is not second rate. Not by any means. We are growing at an ungodly rate. The school is absolutely gorgeous. The school is big. The school sports are badass. Our stadium is growing as I type this. Guys, we are not playing football with the little boys anymore- so fuck the team you grew up watching and scream for those goddamn Eagles! Newsflash: YOU DON'T GO TO AUBURN, GEORGIA, ALABAMA, etc. so take that shit off of your body. It's fine to be a casual fan of another school...but stop putting down GSU when this school has given you everything. Georgia Southern is a school in the midst of the rolling cotton fields of south Georgia, it is fun, it is accredited, it is big, it is established, its degrees hold weight, it has quality faculty, and it is the school that I love. So my fellow students, spread the word....we are the Eagle Nation. ",

            "comment": "I didn't even apply to another school. People look at Georgia Southern from the outside and don't understand the appeal, and it isn't really something you can explain to someone who hasn't experienced Southern. The landscaping and design of the campus is spectacular, and I can tell you that the folks behind keeping it pretty and clean take a great deal of pride in their job. Someone was saying the other day that they say one of the Facilities Services guys on their golf cart come to a screeching halt just to pick up a cigarette butt. The level of care that is taken and the amount of planning put into each design decision is incredible. I didn't agree with a lot of decisions that President Grube made at the time, but the man put down a ten year plan and he made it happen. If Dr. Keel can keep that up, this University is going to experience an explosion of growth and prestige during his time here. Right now we are a Regional University, but Dr. Keel is trying to grow the University into the role of a Research University.\n\nBesides, where else would you catch the President of the University serving Gator to the students in the dining hall!

I don't even know what it was, but I knew I had to be there. 5 years, a degree, and a job later, I know I made a great decision to attend such a wonderful school. I even love the city of Statesboro. It really pisses me off to no end to hear people try to downplay the school. \n\nGreat post. Hail Southern! And with the second best recruiting class in our new FBS conference, GO EAGLES!",

I still miss it, and I've been back in Atlanta for 5 years now. We have top flight programs and the rest of them are still very very good. It really irritated me when I was there, but hopefully with the emergence of us entering FBS (which, let's face it, schools that are considered top tier mostly have high level football or basketball programs) and with our defeat of Florida last year have garnered us more attention, which can only be a good thing. The more people know about Southern, the more they'll come to it. I've heard people say the football transition is a waste of money, but it's about more than sports. It's about getting our name out there. We've started a domino effect. People hear more of us through sports, and then we attract even better faculty and students. I can't wait to see where my alma mater goes in the years to come.\n\nFrom humble farm beginnings\n\nSprung up from the sandy earth\n\nAmong the tow'ring pine trees\n\nStands a treasure of great worth.\n\n\n\nHer price cannot be measured\n\nIn silver or in gold\n\nBut in the love and loyalty\n\nThat many hearts enfold.\n\n\n\nGeorgia Southern University.\n\nOn Eagles' wings you soar.\n\nWe pledge to you our loyalty\n\nAnd love for ever more.\n\n\n\nThrough triumphs and through trials \n\nOur Alma Mater's stood \n\nAs solid as the oak tree \n\nFor justice and for good.\n\nAs through these gates we travel \n\nAnd though our ways must part, \n\nOur Georgia Southern mem'ries \n\nWe'll keep within our hearts.\n\n\nOur beginnings are humble, but we never stop looking forward.

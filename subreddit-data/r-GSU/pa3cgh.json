If you do decide to go in Statesboro I would recommend Taormina of the two. \n\nIf you can check Savannah that would be preferable. \n\nFor a specialist you will likely need a referral to see them. You DO NOT need to visit the ER for a referral. That is very expensive and a bit risky with the current state of things. I would recommend seeing a GP for a referral to a neurologist first.\n\n\nEdit: additionally Patels office is inside Medical Office Building beside the hospital and he is an independent contractor renting office space and NOT a part of the hospital.",

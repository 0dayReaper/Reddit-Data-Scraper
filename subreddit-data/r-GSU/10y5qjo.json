If there is a way for him to transfer the spot to you (and avoid the $500 cancellation penalty), I am sure he would.  I wonder if it's as simple as visiting the Campus Housing Office together?  I can put you two in touch if you wish; he is currently in Centennial.  Regardless, good luck to you!",

I would be interested in trying to make arrangements. I am willing to drive down there but would have to make arrangements if so.",

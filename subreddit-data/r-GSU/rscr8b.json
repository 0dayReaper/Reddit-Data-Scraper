Other than school and work, I spend most of my time studying, working out, or hanging out with my cat, Lucifer, so I need somewhere cat-friendly without any dogs. I mostly keep to myself and I rarely party or drink, so I'm looking to live with other students my age who are quiet and clean, too. 420 friendly, but I'm flexible\n\nPlease let me know if you or anyone you know is in need of a roommate!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[My cat](https://preview.redd.it/9g3vy3ryzq881.png?width=4032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b37d14ffa8f56325d92149324983a6146529abd7)",

Check craigs list, facebook. You can find places real close to armstrong for about 900 to 1200 a month. Most of them suck though fair warning.",

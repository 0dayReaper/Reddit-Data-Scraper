    "postText": "Hey y'all, I'm wondering if anyone would be interested in forming an amateur radio club with me. This would be a \"ham\" radio club, not broadcast fm radio. This is a very diverse hobby, and covers the construction of radios and their use in new and creative ways. As a young and modern club, I think it would be a great oppurtunity to explore some of the modern and cutting-edge aspects of radio such as software-defined radio, digital modes, 5g, microwave transmission, satellite transmission, etc. \n\nThere is a very large emphasis on distaster relief and grid-down communications wihtin amateur radio. Even today, amateur radio operators are often called upon in moments of crisis to fill the communications gap and facilitate contact between FEMA, organaizations such as the Red Cross, and families which may have been broken due to a disaster. As you can imagine, the Savannah area has a robust ARES (Amateur Radio Emergency Services) network.\n\nThe amatuer radio hobby has always had a very strong DIY mentality. Machines are typically purpose-built from repurposed materials. This allows you to make something that works for *you* in your particular circumstance, not something that you buy simply because megaglobacorp told you that you need it. Operating a radio, power source, and antenna that you have made entirely from scratch can be very satisfying.\n\nYou would not have to be a licensed radio operator to participate in this club. In fact, you could never get your license as long as you transmit under the supervision of someone who does. However, there would obviously be an emphasis on instruction in order to allow anyone interested in get licensed. In case you were wondering, it's totally free to get your amateur radio license (and a cool callsign!).\n\nIf anyone is actually interested, it'd be nice to also do some excursions such as mountain hiking and kayaking in order to operate in conditions that do not exist on campus. \n\nIn times such as these, it is more important than ever to contact people all over the world and directly speak to them without any sort of filter or censorship. Amateur radio is all-inclusive, and can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone. \n\nI live in Savannah and would prefer to have this club be centered at the Armstrong campus. I understand that the local Statesboro radio club has at least a historic link with GSU, but I do not know if there is any sort of actual modern partnership. Thank you for reading all of this, and I appreciate your interest.\n\n73,\n\nWhit Watts  KO4EBW",

    "postText": "Are any of yall upper level IT students? I am looking into the specialization classes and I don't know which way to go. If you have a second, which route did you pick and why? I am thinking about maybe cyber or web foundations. I think I will like cyber more, but the web professors seem way better. Taking Hawkins now and she's great. Thanks!",

Have since gone more into networking. I wouldn't sell yourself short on what ever seems easier and give your self a leg up in starting out in your career.",

Could you tell me what the work environment is like in web vs just taking the classes? \n\nHaving the skills to work remotely (web dev as a presumed) is also a big plus for me. I assume that networking/cyber jobs will all requre you to be in person right?",

It was a refreshing change from the rest of my school experience. I ended up becoming a programmer, so I wouldn't take the choice *too* seriously. I've basically been able to land any job I've wanted, though sometimes it takes multiple tries.\n\nMy wife went with whatever the data-oriented specialization was, and she absolutely loved it. It's all about what you're interested in.\n\nIf Kadlec is still there, I'd encourage you to speak with him about the networking specialization classes.",

Now I'm looking at skills that would allow me to work remotely. However, I guess just having the IT degree allows tons of versatility since you're programming now. What kind of programming are you doing?",

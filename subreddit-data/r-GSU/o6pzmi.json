Most of these are the core classes so most people would drop after the first 2 years. I wouldn\u2019t have gotten my job at a big 4 consulting firm without some of my experience being a part of the honor program (I did not have any working or internship experience out of college).",

I personally didn\u2019t study abroad so I can\u2019t speak to that, but I feel like the experiences I received helped me secure multiple other scholarships as an undergrad, practicum/internship experience, etc. I wanted to do research to make myself competitive for graduate school and that worked bc I got offers from several graduate programs and received full funding so I didn\u2019t have to take additional loans in grad school. It gave me the opportunity to get closer to professors in my major who I still use for recommendations for stuff now. I joined as a sophomore (so probably similar experience as you coming as a transfer) and would definitely do it again if I was making the choice now.",

Also, from what I have been told, in past years basically everyone who applied for the study abroad scholarship got something (but I think it ranged from $500-$2k, don\u2019t quote me on those numbers).",

Would you have to fulfill the volunteering requirement? I am sure there is even more benefits at the Statesboro campus, I'm at Savannah and had to drop out of honors because the required courses offered didn't fit into my schedule.",

            "comment": "I graduated as an Honors scholar this past May, BA History. I joined as a Junior with a certain number of credit hours already taken in regular classes, so I was only required to take 1 3-credit hr Honors course of my choosing and the Honors Senior Seminars (for my degree, it was 1 3-credit hr Senior Sem where I drafted a proposal Spring of my Junior year, 2-credit hr Senior thesis, and 1-credit hr senior thesis). I took the last two classes Fall and Spring of my senior year, but they weren't really classes with a set meeting time. Just me independently working on writing my thesis paper. I liked this route the best. I get the perk of being an Honors student on my CV/Resume and Degree, but I didn't take a crap ton of honors classes to get there. Because I joined later, I never took part of the free book program (only for core classes). I never utilized the Honors faculty either, my own department faculty saw that I was a successful student and helped me get scholarships, work, and internships in my field.",

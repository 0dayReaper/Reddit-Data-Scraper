    "postText": "Congrats to the Georgia Southern Eagles on winning the New Orleans bowl, and having a successful season. There wasn't a more ionic moment than when the players rocked out with Guitar Solos on the sideline. \n\nWe are the Know Rivalry Project and we study fans perceptions of rivalry in sports. Please help us expand our results and include the Georgia Southern Eagles by taking 9 minutes to complete our updated survey.\n\nYou can view previous results, links to media coverage, and learn more about us at our KnowRivalry.com website. Our findings have even been highlighted in sports media outlets along with the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.\n\nWe use the Qualtrics online survey software for collection. You will find information on the disclosure agreement that is required to begin the survey. This academic research has been approved by two US universities' Institutional Review Boards (IRB) and it poses zero risk to respondents. Please share this with other fans and thank you for helping us to include the Georgia Southern Eagles.\n\nDr. Joe Cobbs, Northern Kentucky University \n\nJonah, Student Researcher, Northern Kentucky University\n\nDr. David Tyler, University of Massachusetts\u2014Amherst",

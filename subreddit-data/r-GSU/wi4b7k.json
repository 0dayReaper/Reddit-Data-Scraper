    "postText": "I can't seem to find any list anywhere on the school's site, and searching \"foreign language\" on course search just brings up the exit exam class and an education class.\n\nI'm a history major and need to take several levels of one language (so multiple classes in one language) as a requirement. I keep trying to do Spanish, since I took it from a young age from grade school - high school, but when I first took it here it had been maybe 15 years since I had last taken a Spanish class. I can read it well, but struggle with any other aspect of learning and using it. I keep having to retake the same second or third level Spanish class. I really would rather take a class in a language I think I will use in the future for my career, because I struggle to put in any effort into things/classes/etc when I don't think I will really use it, or when there are other similar things I would much rather be doing or learning instead. There are places I'm hoping to move abroad sometime after I'm done with school, and none of them are Spanish speaking places, though they do still speak somewhat popular languages in the places I want to go. But if I remember, I've only really seen Spanish and German as the type of language classes that have multiple levels of classes you go through.\n\nAre Japanese, Korean, or Chinese offered as these type of classes? I'm always seeing random classes offered for stuff related to Ireland. I know it's not spoken popularly even in Ireland anymore, but are there any Irish classes like this? I'd be interested in one off classes in these languages too as they interest me, but I'm really hoping there are the multiple levels of classes available for some of them so I can take them to fill the language classes requirement of my major.\n\nIf they're not available, is there any way to take classes in these languages off campus, at another school, or with a private tutor, and have them easily transferred in to count towards the language classes requirement?",

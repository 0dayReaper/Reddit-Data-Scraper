Freshmen get whatever is leftover, if there\u2019s anything leftover at all. \n\nIf you are wanting a good freshman dorm, I recommend eagle village or centennial place.",

I\u2019m unsure if this is common among colleges, but I don\u2019t care anymore.\n\nI have an apartment secured now (off campus) and I have research to do, the housing department can go waste time and money giving fully furnished rooms to 18-19 year old kids that won\u2019t use the kitchens or common living spaces.",

I don\u2019t understand how the first years are getting freedoms landing. When i was a first year i didn\u2019t even apply for it because i didn\u2019t expect to get it &amp; i wanted to allow more spots for the juniors/seniors.",

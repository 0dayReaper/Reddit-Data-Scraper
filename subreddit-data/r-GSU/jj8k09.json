    "postText": "This is a post to bring awareness to the fact that Autism $peaks U does not support autistic students, does not include Austic students, and does not listen to Autistic students. A group of actually Autistic students have brought forth information about how they are not helping us and we were ignored. Autism $peaks U is not for actually Autistic people rather, it is a group of neurotypicals that have actively silenced Autistic students and refuse to work with us. There purpose does not serve the campus but rather they act as a fundraising site to donate to Autism $peaks national organization. A$ has been called out for years by the autism community for their eugenics ideologies.",

However, It doesn't undo the fact that they want us \"cured\".  despite their new website designs, they focus on infantilizing us and seeing us as burdens to our parents/caregivers. They also still only have 2 Autistic people on the board. So, it's no wonder these neurotypicals that have formed A$U, are perpetuating the same silencing and harm.",

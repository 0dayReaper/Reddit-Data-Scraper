Nope! It\u2019s working and they take my order and I\u2019ve just skipped seven cars.\n\n\nAre these just Freshman/People new to Statesboro? It seems too frequent to be the case.",

The lane also let's people enter and make it to the other side where more parking is or leave when they enter but change their mind and want to go somewhere else. \n\nIt made more sense when there were more people parking and going inside but it's still nice to always have that open lane available.",

Car number three pulls up and sees you two in line. They have a choice to make. \n\n\n4.

Cars #4-7 all line up behind Car #3 because no one wants to rock the boat. \n\n6. The industirous (and-small-car-having) people pull into the inner lane and order without a wait.",

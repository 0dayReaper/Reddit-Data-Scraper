Not sure where to start looking, thinking Market 100 or The George, not set on either place. Any information would help or if you are looking for a roommate let me know! Also, ask any questions or message me if you need!",

There\u2019s supposedly a 35 cap on electricity though my roommate told me that they do a guesstimate of how much you use and are being charged for prior month(s). She has paid an additional $45 in overages.   Whatever you do, avoid copper beech.",

Because of that, I can\u2019t speak too much on UofA Computer science program, but I have heard that UofA has a very good program compared to the program here at GSU. Completely depends on where you\u2019re transferring from though. I can do my best to answer any other questions you have about the program or the transferring process if you need.",

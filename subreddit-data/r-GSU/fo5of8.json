Offer those staff members with prior medical conditions that are susceptible to COVID19 medical leave, and offer room and board refunds for those students who choose to leave. Still host classes online, but have in person office hours that students can receive face to face instruction. Isolate vulnerable populations but allow those who are healthy and won\u2019t be affected by coronavirus to continue with their lives.",

I think it was 10 or 20 bucks? Just gonna take a minute to file in there. When leaving, cut across the grass and get as close to the main road as you can, if you wait in line, you'll be there forever. We sat for 20 minutes in line from our spot, then cut across and was out within 5. Just watch for cars on both sides as it's a free for all.\n\nStore food/drinks in your car for after the race, nothing but gas stations will be open that late.\n\nI also recommend ear protection, I have a scanner and it was so loud I couldn't hear the guys talking.\n\nBut it's a fun time, it goes by quick to!",

Atlanta is the same way, after the race its better to just tailgate and enjoy yourself whileeveryoneelse fightsto get out of the parking lot.\n\nI'm curious to see how many vendors are there. Looking to buy more 1:87 scale diecasts.\n\nWe usually rent scanners at the track but I don't think they're going to be doing due to rona.\n\nAny good restaurants or fun things in the area? We're going for the xfinity race too and may have some time to kill before the race.",

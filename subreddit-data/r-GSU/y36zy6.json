    "postText": "I am partnered with another student in a class. We have to write a script in a foreign language. My partner has personal things going on and is missing classes and will not be doing the work as they will not be present the day the assignment is due. I was told my the teacher I will be required to write my partner\u2019s portion of the assignment or I will get a reduced grade. \n\nI\u2019m 32 years old. I have not been to college in a very long time. Is this normal at GSU? If it is I\u2019m considering going to another school as it\u2019s very stressful to have your grade determined by whether or not another student shows up to class or completes their assignments. I would think the ethical thing to do would be to assign another partner as others are having this issue (teacher has said no) or provide extra credit for extra work completed, or just grade each person based on their own work. \n\nAgain\u2026 maybe this is normal at this school. Any insight? \n\nThanks!",

Did your classmate/partner also tell the professor? \nIf you are truly stressed, you can contact your advisor or the Dean of Students office and ask for assistance as you feel you are being unfairly graded (on someone else\u2019s work). Your advisor can contact the professor for you. The syllabus and rubric are the keys here- if the professor has not clearly stated it\u2019s individual or group they should be accommodating. My group projects are almost always both group and individual; if I email the professor outlining that someone didn\u2019t do their work, their grade is hit and not mine.",

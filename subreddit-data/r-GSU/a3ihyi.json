    "postText": "Hey guys, \n\nIm a freshman here at GSU, im originally from Atlanta. I have been having a hard time making friends here. To note, im pretty different in my mind from everyone ive met here. I look like what could only be comparable to lil peep(lol). I think my different looks and painted nails (im a straight male) deter people away but i dont want to have to change who i am to fit in. I love history. I love to write and make music. I love art and cinema. I keep it under the radar and you wouldn't guess from my appearance but i love video games as well! Im a very introspective person and totally down to talk about anything. Just looking for some nice people to meet. Thanks! ",

You have to go out and make your own friends and make your own sphere of friends. Like what a lot of people are saying are join a club or organization. If you like video games there is a club for that. I think its called Geeks and Gamers. There is a club for everyone really.",

It was a fantastic place and, at the time, my classmates and myself were winning awards for our work.\n\nThat being said, I don\u2019t know any of the current faculty (unless Onyile and Bruce Little are still there, they\u2019re awesome), so it\u2019s a little hard for me to speak to the current experience.",

As long as you do the projects to the best of your ability and listen to professors advice you should be good to go! Also, work hard at developing your portfolio(online and physical) and your resume! This will get you ahead a lot of other graduates. You will have one or two major related courses in freshman year and then it builds. You have to have some because you have to go through sophomore year portfolio to be accepted into the program. That also goes back to doing your projects. I looked into both colleges as well for design and I chose Southern for the art environment as well as the beauty of the campus. Good luck on your endeavors and if you have anymore questions please feel free to ask!",

Southern was further, I got a scholarship and it is a beautiful campus. Your professors will help you if you need assistance finding an internship! You have to have one to graduate. Usually, you have the internship the summer after Junior year!",

You don't have much creative freedom. You're better off learning on your own and creating a great self-taught portfolio than getting a degree. Just my 2 cents, coming from someone who did 3 years of graphic design in high school and 2 years in college. I'm now a computer science major. I finished my graphic design minor a year ago. I'm on the 6 year plan, due to many reasons. But you get the jist. Feel free to reach out if you have questions. Can share past projects from the classes to give you an idea.",

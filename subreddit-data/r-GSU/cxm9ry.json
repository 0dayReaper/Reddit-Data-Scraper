    "postText": "Wiley has a bug in their site that will remove your school discount code AFTER you submit your purchase. In effect, that means your the grand total for your purchase may read as, for example, $85, but after you click \"submit\" it increases to $235. The only way to fix this is to call them (877-762-2974) and complain, and they will NOT be notifying anyone, so you have to be proactive. One person in my class just thought $235 was the real price, and didn't try to fix it. I can't imagine how much money they are skimming off people who don't know better or don't notice the increased charges!",

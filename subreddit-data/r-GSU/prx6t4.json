I'd like to start going to gym, but I've never used gym equipment before and feel kinda embarrassed moving around around other people lol, so if I go with someone else it would feel way better I think. I live right down the street from a Y, but it always looks really busy...but I've never been inside so I'm not sure how busy it actually gets.",

    "postText": "I'm looking for schools with a M.A. in Anthropology program and I came across GSU's Social Science program with a concentration in Anthropology. My question is, how does this look on your transcripts and/or diploma? I assumed it would just say Masters of Arts in Social Science until I saw the academic catalog referred to it as \"Social Science M.A. (Concentration in Anthropology, M.A.)\", which makes it a bit more confusing.\nI'm concerned if it just says M.A. in Social Science it'll make going after my Ph.D in Anthropology harder tbh. I don't want to choose GSU and it end up closing doors for me later instead of opening them, in a nut shell.",

If you're looking for a job at the moment there's a sign on the building saying that they're hiring.\n\nI've never had Fazolis before, but I've been told that its affordable Italian fast food thats really popular on the Georgia Tennessee border.",

It's incredible the number of businesses and restaurants that have come in since I left.\n\nI remember right after I got there in 2003, Statesboro couldn't even support a Publix. Closed down because it couldn't complete with the Walmart. While Fazoli's is not the epitome of fine dining, I love what it means for the community that it has attracted so many business.",

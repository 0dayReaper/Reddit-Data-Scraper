Plus, if you're graduating in Spring 2018 or earlier, then the catalog for that academic year will be completed well before consolidation occurs. The catalog is, essentially, a contract between you and ASU that says what you need to do to get a degree from them. \n\nChat with your advisor in August and they'll have an idea then of what is expected.

Weird and some changes will need to be made, but overall the day-to-day aspects of class and work will likely not change. \n\nFor the UNG consolidation, stuff like Admissions was split across campuses and they let attrition handle duplicate roles or made new offices/positions to absorb the \"extra\" people since firing folks is not wanted. \n\nI'll predict the biggest things will be rebranding ASU's campus and ensuring that Statesboro and Savannah campuses share the same policies and processes. \n\nFor students, it's probably going to mean tuition and fees will change once complete. Hopefully they'll do different ones for each campus though and not just lump Savannah under the Statesboro umbrella. \n\nThe Savannah students will likely get the most benefits though. They'll have easier access to graduate programs and information. Their athletics will have access to a larger brand and budget. As a satellite campus, they will be able to maintain their traditions while also adopting new ones. ",

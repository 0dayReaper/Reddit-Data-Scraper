    "postText": "Hi all!\n\n**Science Olympiad at Georgia Tech** is hosting the 2023 Georgia Science Olympiad State Tournament on Saturday, April 15th on the Georgia Tech campus, and we're looking for volunteers to help run events! There will be about 450 high school students from 30 schools competing that day. If you were involved with Science Olympiad in high school and would like to meet with other SciOly alumni, or if you would just like to come hang out, please consider joining us on tournament day. You do not need have been involved in Science Olympiad in middle or high school to volunteer. \n\nIn particular, we are looking for general volunteers to support event supervisors. General volunteers can volunteer for any amount of hours on tournament day. If you are interested in being a general volunteer, please fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/tqAoMh3yNf6wHJUr9). Pizza (around noon) and snacks all day will be provided to all volunteers. \n\nIf you have any questions, please let us know at [scioly.gatech@gmail.com](mailto:scioly.gatech@gmail.com). Thanks for your support!",

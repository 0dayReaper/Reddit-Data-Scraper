    "postText": "I recently got accepted to GSU as a transfer into the CS program. I\u2019m starting w the mini semester in March at Armstrong campus and was wondering what the best classes to take are for a new student are (my core is p much done except for 2 anthro classes and chem 2)? I was thinking about principles of programming I as one of my firsts, but idk what else I should take. \n\nI haven\u2019t coded as much as I would have liked to, pretty much at Hello World level if we\u2019re being honest. I plan on studying basic concepts like functions and loops before classes start to give me some understanding\n\nI was also wondering if there were any clubs or organizations for CS majors or women in tech that are cool? \n\nTIA!!",

If you\u2019re wanting to do general EE work in the US, most people only get a bachelors degree. The only reason to get a masters degree is if you want to do research or be a professor. Engineering jobs are more common the in the southeastern US but the Statesboro area doesn\u2019t have a whole lot to offer",

Good undergrad school but my grad research at another school is way cooler with way better funding and a much better connected PI. \n\nSmall school for undergrad, big school for grad school is a well-worn path. As long as you did well in your undergrad work, you could probably do better for grad school than GSU. \n\nI still love GSU though so no shade to the grad Eagles and Double Eagles out there!",

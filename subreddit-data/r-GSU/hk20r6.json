    "postText": "Hi everyone :) I am taking a poll for students of USG colleges regarding fall 2020 semester and the coronavirus. Again this poll is only for students of USG colleges to take. Please feel free to share this link with other students in a USG college. The poll is confidential and it won\u2019t gather your personal information. I\u2019ve been asked this a couple times, but I am a student attending a USG college and the reason I am taking a poll on this is because I\u2019ve seen many comments of USG students being concerned about this fall semester, and I\u2019m curious to know what everyone is thinking. This is a very short poll though :) thank you!!!!\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WJ6KzZtHDPjgooFlB8GBh1ihpVfpw12loUSFvEeaV5Q/edit",

    "postText": "Hi, so I am going to be a Civil Engineering freshman at GSU next week and I was wondering if I need a graphing calculator and if so what model y'all recommend. Currently, I have a TI-36x Pro that I used during high school but I can buy a higher end graphing calculator if I need to.",

Most profs don\u2019t allow them on anything graded. With that said, a good calculator is nice for HW and practice problems as a way to double check your answers. The TI-89 and the TI NSPIRE CAS are both great calculators, the latter being my preference.",

Then when I had to take the FE exam (which I passed) I had to quickly relearn a new calculator. \n\nEverybody I know uses the TI-36 for the FE. It\u2019s great and I should have gotten one as a freshman!",

You get 10 free visits I believe and you don\u2019t have to set it up through health insurance or anything like that since it comes out of student fees. Also, they provide group therapy at the counseling center if that\u2019s your thing. \n\nJust do remember that therapy is something that requires you to put in what you want to get out of it. Im happy that you\u2019re looking into therapy options if you feel you need it though, OP. ",

Then I had to take a medical withdrawal because I made an attempt. But the psychology clinic is awesome! It's the little building on campus near Sweetheart Circle that is covered with seashells. Directly across from that building with the playground outback. Typically only $5 a session. One of the best therapists I've ever seen worked there. ",

Highly suggest that as well since it gives a weekly outlet opposed to every few weeks. Not sure who is there now but they were always great when I was there. ",

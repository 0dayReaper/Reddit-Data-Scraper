I started this program because I am one of the millions of americans that struggle with financial stability. We've been running for a year and serve over 30 students and staff. Sometimes that $4 dollars is all we have. No one should have to decide between having gas to get to work and school and managing a natural occurrence. I hope you find the beauty and kindness instead of continuing hateful, rude commentary.",

The only addition I would suggest is to break down the percentages by campus as well since the infections are so skewed toward Statesboro. This shows the infection rate for Statesboro is \\~3% instead of just above 2% for the whole university (based on 2019 Fall enrollment of 18256)\n\n[https://em.georgiasouthern.edu/ir/facts-and-figures/](https://em.georgiasouthern.edu/ir/facts-and-figures/)",

    "postText": "I don't know how many active students hang out in this subreddit, but from the bottom of my heart, I just want to say thanks for being patient with us, your professors, during this week of transition online. \n\nIt has been a weird one, and it has involved trying to move courses online that were never intended to be online. It has caused a lot of square-peg-in-round-hole situations. But I'm only missing two students post-transition, and all I've experienced with students so far is patience, love, and persistence to get through this semester successfully. \n\nY'all are wonderful. You're the reason I love this job.",

                    "comment": "I don't have an answer. \n\nThe messaging we got back when the announcement came out we were transitioning online (Middle of spring break) was that a very small handful of classes will still be meeting in-person in staggered groups of less than six people at a time. Then we were later told to not assume that will actually happen and go ahead and do your best to move fully online. \n\nI'm not engineering, but we're having the same problem as you over here -- I teach in the Communication Arts department, and we have [the production studio](https://www.greggwillett.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WILLETT_LAS_SANFORDHALL-0023.jpg) in the basement where we teach converged news production, news broadcasting, single-camera production and multi-camera production, among other classes. \n\nThose are all hands-on courses that are built around teaching students how to, for example, run a full live TV broadcast. Those classes have moved to teaching students how to use available software and lighting tricks to do professional-looking broadcasts from home. It's not the same, but it's making the best of a shitty situation. \n\nAnd students in those classes do pay more for access to the equipment. I think all Comm Arts students pay a tech fee because (not many Georgia Southern students know this btw) we have a whole basement full of high-end video/audio/photography equiptment students can check out like a library for free. I am hoping that if we do have to offer partial refunds of the fee, it doesn't fuck us too bad on our ability to keep the equipment up-to-date.",

    "postText": "It's under Student Employment in the myGSU portal. If you haven't heard of it, it's basically a job board and platform for the Office of Career Development. It just replaced Eagle Career Net, which felt very outdated lol.\n\nIf it aggregated other job listings from other sites, then it would be a really good platform. However, the number of listings is quite small, at least in my experience.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone has had any luck with it. I personally would rather use Indeed or even LinkedIn to find jobs.",

I think Eagle Career Net had more positions available in general, and the pandemic certainly isn't making things easy.\n\nReally, all that Handshake is good for is getting some interviews, getting your resume checked, and reporting internships.",

I've consistently had issues with Housing not caring about the cleanliness or sanitation of dorms. In 2017, I made a notification to housing about mold in my dorm. They came in and spray painted over it  When I set up a meeting with housing, it was made clear that it was not their responsibility. It was followed up by further distancing themselves and putting cleaning/sanitation responsibility onto students themselves. Housing is not here for us. Like most departments on campus, any issues are not their problem and are seen as an inconvenience. How dare I want things to be done with integrity and compassion",

They swear up and down they have someone clean the dorms in between semesters. It's not true, but they're too busy saving face instead of having respect and integrity for the student population. They \"sanitized\" rooms during the initial chaos of covid. Upon entering a sanitized room, I found a shower full of mold. Sooo, what sanitation actually took place? I want reciepts.",

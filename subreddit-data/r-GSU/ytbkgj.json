Public schools shoe accessible to many, but forget UGA or Tech unless your GPA is well above 4.0 and you have taken 8 or more AP classes, done dual enrollment or are an IB scholar.\n\nOther schools get left off the list: \nGCSU in Milledgeville: small, but impressive business department. \nUNG: cybersecurity great dept. \n\nBest of luck!",

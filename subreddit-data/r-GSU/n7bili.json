            "comment": "Life in Bulloch: one afternoon not too long ago, a strange man pulled into my driveway*, opened up the hatch on his SUV, played \"It Is Well With my Soul\" on trombone, with a recorded accompaniment (speaker in the back of his SUV,) and then we had a 5-10 minute discussion about his career as a GSU professor and inventor of some weirdness that was purchased by the CIA and proselytizer. \n\nI recorded the whole interaction, because it was so strange that I might have been accused of imagining it. An old friend (GSU 1992 I think) looked into it, and the dude was legit. \n\n*I literally live on a dirt road with only 8 houses in 2 miles. It's not on the way to anywhere. Anyone who pulls into my driveway is supposed to be here or they're lost, which is why I walked out to talk to the guy.",

I got there a little early, and the professor comes in and tells us to pull out our laptops to go on zoom. \n\nAnd I also have the opportunity to show up to another one of my classes on campus, so that my professor can lecture from zoom on the PowerPoint. That\u2019s also been fun because it requires a fair amount of decibels to have a proper discussion of the content. \n\nI get it\u2014there\u2019s a pandemic and I get that our professors and faculty are trying. But holy shit I\u2019m just annoyed at everything that Southern\u2019s administration keeps doing. \n\nI\u2019ve been annoyed in the past with their short-sightedness during hurricanes, and even then I feel like safety was considered a hell of a lot more for students and faculty. Things could be far worse, but at the same time I can\u2019t help but feel that showing up on campus is a huge waste of time (for me at least).",

I'm a grad student now, was an undergrad in 2016, and I remember when Matthew was barreling towards us. I was in the middle of a morning class when the university decided to cancel everything. We all ran back to our dorms to pack up and 16 was a mess already. The trajectory was pretty known for a few days before that but they LOVE being last minute with calling anything off.\n\nI agree that the in-person class groupings are annoying and effectively useless. The only reason I could see someone going to them is if they don't have access to any device that connects to the internet at that time, but everyone I've seen in them brings their own laptops to sit there. Why? To needlessly expose yourself just to watch the professor on a projector rather than your screen?\n\nIt's all really just a way Southern can create the illusion of choice. They're trying to lean into in-person instruction as much as possible so students (and more importantly their parents) feel like there's always an opportunity to get the actual college experience. You won't. Not during this time. \n\nI wish they would give up the ghost already, especially with Labor Day weekend approaching. UGA's numbers are absolutely awful and Southern's are bad too. I now know many friends and friends of friends that have COVID, or they suspect COVID, and none of them AND none of their roommates have been going out or otherwise acting irresponsibly. All that tells me is that it's a matter of time before everyone has to go into quarantine. Genuinely not worth it.",

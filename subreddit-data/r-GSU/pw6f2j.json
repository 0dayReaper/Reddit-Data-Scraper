That is completely unacceptable.  Don't care how good or bad a player is, he should not have played.  Love the busses and hope they keep rolling, but this is not how it should be.",

It seems we don't have any backups prepared and ready.  With Tomlin out for those games, the offense was terrible.  We'll see if there are any changes, but if you look at GT, changing from the option is at least a 3 year dry spell (3-9, 3-7, 2-2 this year) to get the correct personnel to run something different.\n\nI love what Chad has done with the team.  A fantastic guy and I wish Benko would have given him a bit longer runway.  After FAU, I expected an Arkansas type score in the ULL game.  The fact that it was close was encouraging. But we'll move forward.",

I still believe if Tech had decent defenses, CPJ would have been monstrously successful there. For GSU, I think we should hire Bohannon from Kennesaw and go back to the traditional option under center.",

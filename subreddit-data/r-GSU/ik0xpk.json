Every major government has passed relief packages that utilize: unemployment, business stimulus, tax relief, equipment and research funding to get through this.  \n\n\nEach version utilizes those resources with varying degrees of precision, and my argument is that the massive amounts of money we have spent on increased unemployment benefits and small business grants would have been better utilized being more directly tied specifically to the elderly (direct emergency funding for increased staff, equipment testing, and training at Nursing Homes, Hospice Care, and retirement communities etc) and directly to anyone still in the workforce with dangerous co-morbidity who should be self-isolating.  \n\n\nInstead of forcing every business to shut-down completely and then giving them 6 weeks of payroll to \"survive\", a smaller amount of money could have been utilized to help only employees and community members who are vulnerable isolate.",

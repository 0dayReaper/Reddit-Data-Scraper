It's a great way to improve your resume, and you'll make some life-long friends along the way. \n\nYou don't have to be a Multimedia Journalism major to get involved, they do all the quick training courses on their end of things. Even if you don't want a career in journalism or anything in the communications world, being able to put student media work on your resume shows that you have a dedication to writing, producing, and communicating clearly -- and working on a deadline. All of those are things that make your resume shine to any employer no matter the industry. \n\nSo give it a shot.",

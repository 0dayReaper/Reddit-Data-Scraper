The amount of money that the USG and Georgia Southern hemorrhaged last year from having to return fees to students when they left was astounding. It may suck for students and parents, but it also allows for an untold number of faculty and staff to retain their jobs.",

On-campus 15-hour semester is $2732. You pay tech fees &amp; institution fees either way.\n\nSo it makes sense that no tuition would be refunded. Prorated fees, maybe, but not tuition. Please correct me if I'm missing something obvious. This made me feel a bit better when I was putting together my schedule.\n\nETA: This is for in-state students obviously. Out-of-state students should really look into online classes. You would be losing a lot of money in this situation.",

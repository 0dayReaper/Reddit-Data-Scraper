    "postText": "I am from Boston MA area and I\u2019m currently deciding between Georgia State and Georgia Southern for their MPH program and I need to make a decision soon. I was wondering if any one had any insight (unbiased insight because I know that these schools are rivals) on the how the JPH college is and how good or bad the professors are? I have received a graduate assistantship position from Southern so I\u2019m strongly leaning toward that school but I feel like Georgia State is in a better location for public health and I\u2019m used to living in the city. Does anyone know how Statesboro compares to Atlanta?Georgia state also has a lot of info on alumni that have had successful careers in public health but I can\u2019t seem to find that info for Southern. If anyone has any insight on this that would help me out a lot. I also would like to know how difficult it is for students to find internships/practical experience in the area since that\u2019s a requirement to graduate. Thank you.",

From what I understand, it's actually a pretty good college with a decent national reputation. One of the faculty is a past president of APHA, and, depending on your area of specialization, the faculty are quite strong. Your assistantship can go a long way in statesboro, since it is a lot, lot cheaper than Atlanta, which goes to point 2:\n\n2. Atlanta vs Statesboro - this is one I can comment on. Statesboro is not a city, not even close. There is a strong sense of community among the locals, but there is a considerable divide between locals and the college in a lot of ways. There is roughly one of everything you \"need\" in town, but you'd need to go to Savannah for a lot of specialty stores or variety. There are a fair number of grad students and faculty who live outside of statesboro and drive in either because it is more rural and cheaper or closer to savannah and has more variety\n\n3. It's a shame that they don't do a better job of publicizing it, but the college has definitely placed people in places like the CDC, state and federal programs and other \"name brand\" sorts of stuff. They used to have a real strong focus on rural public health, and they're still pretty good with that but it isn't the only focus\n\n4. No trouble with internships, as far as I can tell. They have staff specifically geared toward that, and they wouldn't make it a requirement if no one was finding them\n\nGood luck!",

If you can do that Statesboro can be some of the most fun you have. \n\nI worked night shift last semester and between that and class I had a hard time still being social and I could feel myself deteriorating.

I now live in Atlanta and would personally tell you to go to Georgia State. I had a wonderful time as an undergraduate but the graduate college is a hot mess and I regret staying often (not same field as you but was choosing between those two schools). State\u2019s campus is not the nicest but their grad programs are well respected.",

Constant turnovers in leadership. Money issues. I know an unfortunate amount of GA\u2019s who were let go bc of budget problems, and that was before Covid so can only imagine what it\u2019s like now. Also to answer your question of internships/practical experience, I had to do several throughout my degrees and had to do all of them in neighboring cities. I am sure it\u2019ll be similar for your field, you\u2019ll likely have to go to Savannah (hour away) or Augusta (hour and a half). Like I said, I loved my time as an undergrad, but things have changed a lot in recent years and I don\u2019t know that I would make the same decision to stay if I were starting grad school today. I do know people who went through the MPH program and are working in the field, but I am not sure you\u2019ll get the data you\u2019re looking for regarding long careers bc it\u2019s a relatively new college (I think it was brought to the university sometime in the 2006-2010 range, but not 100%).",

If you want city life (or hell even suburban city life) DO NOT come to Statesboro. As much as I love the school, Statesboro is a boring ass town with literally nothing to do if you are under 21 or don\u2019t have a good fake id. \n\nThere are 2 grocery stores, 1 Walmart, 1 Neighborhood Walmart. There\u2019s a handful of fast food chains, a couple of bars and a few nicer restaurants. \n\nAs for entertainment, there\u2019s the bars and a bowling alley. If you don\u2019t drink you will be bored out of your mind down here. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to spend your weekends watching football and paying $25 to get into shitty bars then go to GA State.",

Once you\u2019re accepted in the program you don\u2019t have to worry about advisement as your classes are set. Just have to register in time with what they send you. \n\nI\u2019ve had a good experience, but I would apply/look at other programs just to make sure. Also the Savannah Campus has larger cohorts and a better simulation lab, so it really just depends on where you want to live. If you have any other questions DM me!",

Getting a response from can take like a month which due to needing a code for registration ( which is some bullshit) I was registered late and charged the fee. All of my financial aid was not applied due to the freeze date.",

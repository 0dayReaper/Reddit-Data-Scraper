    "postText": "IT'S OVER. IT'S FINALLY OVER.\n\nI received the notification that my diploma is in the mail. After 5 long years at GSU I have finally graduated. I won't be using my degree, I've chosen to pursue a career in culinary arts, but holy fuck I am a college graduate. My mental health is nowhere near as good as it was when I first started, I'm broke, and now I'm stuck in Statesboro until I can afford to relocate, but god damn I'm fucking done.",

It\u2019s almost like they know that COVID has a survival rate of 99.96% if you\u2019re under 75.\u201d\n\nThis proves that people don\u2019t understand how the masks and social distancing are supposed to work. I don\u2019t want to give someone Covid and then they pass it along to someone with a weaker immune system, so I wear a mask. You don\u2019t wear a mask to protect yourself. It can still get in through the eyes. \n\nMasks are not 100% effective however. The social distancing helps, but are you really going to a bar to distance yourself from people? It\u2019s best to not go at all.",

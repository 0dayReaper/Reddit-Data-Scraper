If GSU has a hyperloop club, then please DM this account, and we can talk! If y'all don't have a club but are interested in starting one at Georgia Southern, feel free to hit us up as well! We can provide some advice about that.",

That's a hyperloop team. \n\nHyperloop clubs offer students more opportunities for R&amp;D than most motorsports teams due to the unproven nature of the technology, but besides that, most everything else is quite similar.",

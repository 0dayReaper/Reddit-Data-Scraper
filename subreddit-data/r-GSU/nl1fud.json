I'm not sure how quiet it is over there, hopefully someone can elaborate on that more. You'll definitely have to drive to campus though.\n\nIf you prefer walking to campus on occasion, I recommend Monarch 301 (which is where I'm at). I have a 1 bed, 700 sq. ft. apartment for about $1050/month. Maybe not the most affordable, but the convenient location makes up for that imo. Other than occasional loud talking from the halls, it's not that loud for me.",

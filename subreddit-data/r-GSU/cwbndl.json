    "postText": "Yes, I read the RMP reviews and I even technically had him for lab last year. He's a great guy and super smart. However...has anyone had Pathophysiology with him and just didn't do well in the class? Many of the reviews are just \"fine\"/\"hard class\"/:just got to study\". It's only the third day and I am already falling behind and our first exam in on Tuesday. Any past students of his have actual advice other than the character limit on RMP?",

I learned more in his classes than any other class I took at GSU or in Grad school. When he handed me my diploma on graduation day, it was more than a victory. ASK QUESTIONS. Make him notice you. Ask well thought out questions that aren't easily answered by the text book. I kind of doubt his teaching style has changed much since my time there. Study your old tests because he will recycle questions. Hang in there - you can make it!",

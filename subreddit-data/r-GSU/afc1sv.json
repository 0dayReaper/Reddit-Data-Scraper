    "postText": "Hi, so I researched heavily and couldn't find anything on this before I moved here to live on campus so I assume some people are very curious about internet speeds as I was if you are living on campus..\n\nI live in University Terrace and here are the internet speeds for my room. \n\n[Speeds](http://www.speedtest.net/result/7952341896.png)\n\nI come from a house with 100/10 so I can deal with this, especially with a lot more upload speed.\n\nAlso, I don't have a picture of the one Lab's speed I went into the other day but those speeds were around 500/500 up and down so pretty good.\n\nEDIT: the 50/50 internet is free. hopefully it stays that way.(you can upgrade to 100/100 for $89/month)",

However, when I was in grad school at Texas A&amp;M I paid $100 a month for 100/20 in 2016. I live in Tallahassee now and pay $119 a month. Google says 9.8/5.63. Xfinity (my provider) says 72/5.9. It's trash. Side note, my parents pay $50+ a month for sub 10/10 in rural Lee County, GA. Internet service around here is pretty shitty. ",

I lived in Fort Worth Texas last year before I moved to Florida and my parents paid around $100 for 25/5 so I know the pain. Now my parents pay $90 for 110/10 which is decent. BTW, the internet here on campus is free.. forgot to mention that.",

We have a COD team currently but I'd like for us to have a 2nd armstrong team if we can get 5 people from your campus! If you guys would like to join the College COD discord, make sure to do it! I'll link it below but also hmu if you play COD!  Thanks! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://discord.gg/feBPsHd](https://discord.gg/feBPsHd)",

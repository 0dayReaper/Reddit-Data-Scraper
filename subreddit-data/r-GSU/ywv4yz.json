You're relying on someone else to provide EMS with information about your disorder, why don't you have a medical card all ready? That should've happened the day you got a diagnosis. A lot of places don't have wheelchairs because the people that need them? All ready have them. If you want one, they're $200 on Amazon. Really it just sounds like you're being very irresponsible when you go out in public and are trying to blame everyone else for you not paying attention to your own body. You said your toe went numb? Which meant blood was pooling in your feet? But you chose to ignore it. Intermission was your out. Leaving then, you'd've been able to avoid almost alllllll of what you wrote about. But nope. You made the choice to stick around and are now throwing a hissy fit. You're being irresponsible about your health. Do better.",

If there's a way to submit complaints to the PAC and the campus police department, I didn't know about it and I didn't think to check because I didn't realize it was a possibility. I'll look into that.",

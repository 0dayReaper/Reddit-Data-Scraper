I am currently a Sophomore transfer and I finished my first semester yesterday. I did have all online classes and next semester will be my first semester on campus. Does anyone have any experience with the CSDS program on Armstrong campus? I haven\u2019t been able to find anything on here and while registering for classes I noticed that a majority of the core classes for the major are online which i\u2019m kind of worried about since I don\u2019t learn very well online. I would love to hear from anyone who has graduated or is currently in the program since I kind of have 0 idea what i\u2019m coming across here. Thanks!",

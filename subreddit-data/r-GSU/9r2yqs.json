She's not quoting the material when she uses the word, according to the student, and she's been reprimanded for the *same exact thing* before. Whether or not she agrees with the department's opinion on her use of the word, she should have learned from her prior experiences.\n\nThat word has it's place in literary and historical discussions, but this professor should have used better judgment on how and when to make use of the word. Particularly in a social climate as tense as the one in which we live today, perhaps discussing the use of the word beforehand would have been appropriate.\n\nAt the end of the day, there was almost certainly a better way for her to get her point across which wouldn't involve repeatedly using a word that she's already been in trouble for using before and wouldn't involve using a slur that still carries so much weight.\n\nAnd before anyone equates it to high school, no, this is not the same thing as saying the word when reading verbatim from Huckleberry Finn or Tom Sawyer.",

Whether anyone likes it or not, the speaker, audience, and context of the use of that particular word change the effect. A black person using that word will always be different than someone of another race using it. There is far too much historical and social context behind that term for it to be taken so lightly. \n\nShe knew the word was inflammatory. She knew there were a million ways she could make her point. She knew she'd been reprimanded for it before. She decided to do it anyway. \n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes. \n\nI agree that higher education will involve touchy and offensive topics. I disagree that she needed that specific word to make her point, and so does the school. In fact, that was probably the most hamfisted and clumsy way to put it. How many thousands of ways could she have phrased her point that would have been more tactful? You should expect discretion and thoughtfulness from college professors. She exhibited neither of these.\n\nI'm not out here saying she's a flaming racist or something, but she made a bad decision, again, and there was what seems to be a justified backlash. It's not as if she shouldn't have expected this since the same exact thing happened before. ",

In fact, I would argue that she detracted from her lesson and did her students a disservice by distracting them with such an obvious attempt to be inflammatory. The context in which she used the word was not appropriate, nor was it professional. Her impropriety is not in line with the purvey of higher education. Her decision making skills, in this moment, were severely lacking. By repeating her mistake, which she should have learned from the first time, she has cheapened what could have been an effective moment for her students.\n\nWords have power. Words have meaning. Words have context. They always have. They always will. We have been moving forward since the dawn of language, and words still carry weight. You will not find a society that is without inflammatory and inappropriate language, and yet we will continue truly moving forward.\n\nWords, written or spoken, are the vehicle by which opinions, knowledge, and insight are delivered to others. What was the professor delivering to her students by using this word haphazardly and outside of its original context? Was there a more effective way to make her point? Is this really the best that higher education has to offer, or can we do better? I believe that, in fact, this is an example of students demanding more of their educational system, not less. This is an example of students being conscious of improper conduct in a professional environment, and I'm proud to see that they voiced their concern. They weren't afraid to confront and question their professor. Asking questions and challenging the status quo are pillars of excellence in education.\n\nWhat were they discussing in this class? They were exploring the topic of a 57 year old work of literature in a political science class. This particular scenario is the intersection of words, context, history, and society at large. We are discussion a literary work that still influences people today. To bemoan that we treat words \"in that manner\" is to say that Frantz' work should be powerless. Why are we discussing it if words aren't influential?",

The very point she was trying to make would have been far more clearly communicated if she hadn't used that word.\n\nI also have a hard time getting past the fact that she's been reprimanded for this before, but thought it was a good idea to use the word indiscriminately again, outside of its original context.\n\nI'm not saying she's some racist caricature or that she was looking for an excuse to shout the word in public, but she made a bad decision based on prior experiences, distracted from her lesson, and caused a ruckus for no reason. She had to know that wasn't going to fly, particularly in a tense social climate on a college campus.",

Like she wasn't quoting any material and she brought the word up, to my understanding, out of almost nowhere. Students last week, when she was referencing (I stress referencing not quoting) a book, said they were uncomfortable with using the word and she dismissed the arguments they gave. Then, after one of the students went to the polisci chair to talk about how her response to the students feeling uncomfortable was kind of inappropriate, she used it again this week and defended her use of it by literally saying at one point, \"I lived in Compton in the 1970's. The word affects me as much as it does you.\" \n\nLike, I get you sort of, if they're quoting something then yeah be mature maybe make your reservations known later if it made you that uncomfortable. But if you're gonna get reprimanded for it more than once and then sit there and argue about it with students in class (hit up those recordings) then maybe you should just, ya know, **not**. They made it clear they were uncomfortable, she had plenty of time to just **not** and she wasn't even quoting anything. She just straight up was using the word in conversation about derogatory terms, but they weren't even talking about the n-word at the time to my knowledge. \n\nFurthermore, if you look at the George Anne article and actually read it, it makes all of this pretty clear. They also have a quote from a student in the class about their feelings towards her use. \n\nEven FURTHERMORE your ass knows this is a sensitive word in sensitive political climate in a campus that literally had a protest on this EXACT TOPIC last week. Maybe just take the .005 seconds of thought required to just **NOT** I mean how god damn hard is it to just say \"the n-word\"?\n\n**tl;dr** y'all even read the article ? **She wasn't quoting shit**, and they had informed her superiors the week before and made it clear to her they weren't comfortable with her using the word. They, according to the students, didn't even get on to her ass when she was just quoting. It was only when she stopped **just** quoting.",

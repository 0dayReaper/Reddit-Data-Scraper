Do you think the storms will be significant enough to close businesses around Statesboro or will those who work still have to be in the Boro anyways even if classes are canceled? Just trying to see what other people around campus think.",

Word is that ever since two years ago when the school cancelled nearly two weeks for what amounted to a pretty average storm, the administration is really gun shy about cancelling. \n\nAlso, on our side of things we've been told that in the event of campus closures, we're supposed to move lessons to Folio and keep the class going as to miss as little time as possible. Who knows how many faculty will follow that, but we're being told by administration that's what we need to do.",

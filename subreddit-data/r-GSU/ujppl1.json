    "postText": "Good morning Reddit! \n\nI\u2019m Victoria, I\u2019m an upcoming transfer student who will be starting in the fall. A little about me: I\u2019m transferring from CSU after doing 3 semesters there. I joined the army in august and finished training in February. I\u2019ll be coming in as a sophomore and currently set to graduate in fall of 24. \n\nSo what are some of the things/groups to avoid on campus?\n\nWhat are ways to make friends easily? (I lived in the dorms at CSU which made making friends easy, I\u2019m living at the monarch in the fall)\n\nWhat is the city like? How\u2019s the job market?\n\nHow involved is Greek life?\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite spot to study?\n\nSorry for all the questions, I\u2019m super excited to be starting soon and hoping to know some of the ins and outs before moving. \n\nThank y\u2019all in advance :)",

You'll find people you'll like\n\nWhat's the town like/jobs- jobs aren't too hard to come by, lots of fast food, lots of restaurants to be a waiter, Walmart, lowes, all those places are always hiring. The city is okay, there isn't a whole lot to do but there is the \"club house\" and lots of people go to the bars, pools or hang with their friends haha.\n\nGreek life is a lot. There are a lot of frats and sororities and they are a little intense. It's good of your into that but if you're not it is a little much.\n\nFavorite place to study- the library has study rooms you can \"rent\" for a couple hours online and those are great because they are a little more private and it's fun to be with your friends in there. Also three tree coffee. Great coffee and a cute place to study!",

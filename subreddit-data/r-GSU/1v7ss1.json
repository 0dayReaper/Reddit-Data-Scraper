I do believe that your team is going to get better, but the reasons you listed are not the reason why. I see very little support for the Panthers despite these 'reasons' why you are a better football team. The biggest thing you can boast is a winning season your inaugural year. Since then it's been downhill for your football program. One victory in the last two years, the athletic department dropping money as an incentive to bring students in, and you think Georgia State is on an uprise? Your fan base thinks they are entitled to be successful because of its qualifications, and that's not the case. GS was built from the ground up. We had no field, plain uniforms, and a football from K-Mart when we started football, yet we won our first national championship the second year we were in the FCS. GS may be in 'Statesboring' but Paulson Stadium will always have more seats filled with people than whatever field the Panthers decide to use.\nFor the record, I prefer the GS acronym to the GSU one; I feel it pays tribute to the Georgia Southern College teams who helped compile the six national championships. You've been GSU the entire time you've compiled your ten total wins.",

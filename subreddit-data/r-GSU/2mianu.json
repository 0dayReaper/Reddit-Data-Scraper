I never had a discussion with him at length though. I figured he was focused in on what he was doing. Just told him he was a cool guy, that his art was awesome and to keep doing his thing.\n\nThat post actually hurt me to read. I don't blame him for deciding to quit really. I wouldn't want to look over my shoulder every second either. \n\nPeople. What a bunch of assholes.",

I guess Fazoli's is decent if you really don't feel like cooking, but for the price of a single pasta dish, you could buy multiple *pounds* of pasta, plus some extra ingredients for sauces.\n\nI'm kind of biased lol, I don't really do restaurants anymore for a lot of reasons. But there's nothing wrong at all with eating out.",

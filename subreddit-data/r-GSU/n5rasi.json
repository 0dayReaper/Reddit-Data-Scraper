    "postText": "Hey all! I'm trying to get a study group together for the GRE in September and October.\n\n\nI'm hoping to set up (preferably) a face-to-face meeting, two times a week, sometime in the mornings (between 8am and 12pm). \n\n\nIdeally, we would be meeting at Cool Beanz on Fridays and one other day.\n\nI'm planning on sending out a few emails (once I've gathered 7-8 people, already have 4!) to schedule some weekly study sessions over the summer, both face-to-face and virtual! :)\n\n\nIf y'all are interested just send me a PM/chat and I'll send you my GSU email address!",

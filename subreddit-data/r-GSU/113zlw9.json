Go grab the book that Chris wrote from Pladd Dot music, he used it for the class. I already knew some stuff and that helped me a lot with piecing together how to play different things. I also took a music production sort of class that was fun while I was a biology major.",

There aren't shortcuts to learning an instrument. Just learn what you want, when you want, and over time you'll get better. I've played drums for almost a decade now and I can say 100% teachers don't help except pointing out your mistakes for you.",

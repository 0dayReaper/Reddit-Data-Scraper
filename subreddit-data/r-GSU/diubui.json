I graduated with a bachelor's in accounting five years ago but have never worked in the accounting field. I've spent the last 10 years in banking--teller, management, financial crimes, and currently operations. Lately I've been feeling like I need a change and one option I'm considering is going back for my MAcc. I feel like I've forgotten everything since my undergrad so I'm concerned I may struggle in a MAcc program. I'm also wary about taking out more loans to pay for it. I've also just considered doing a study program for the CPA and just going that route (I already meet the qualifications to sit for the exam). \n\nI guess my question would be did you find the program to be a good investment? Would you recommend to others? Do you feel like there are good networking opportunities (and not necessarily for the big 4 but just any sort of potential employers)?",

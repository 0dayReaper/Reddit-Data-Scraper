I'm posting on the off chance that someone might be also making that round trip either weekend and might be able to give me a ride.  I would chip in for gas!  Please let me know!",

One of your friends is probably in it and can add you so you aren\u2019t giving your number out online. You can also private message me and I can try to add you. There\u2019s 1600 people already so I don\u2019t know what the limit is.",

If you don't like a product or service, don't buy it...but that doesn't work with higher ed. Good education is practically a necessity for people to move up in life.",

While I agree college is practically a necessity to move up, Universities did not make these students go to college right now. They couldve waited a year and taken advantage of the resources they're being charged and not reimbursed for",

And that one year can be used to rack up some cash to take courses online and on the cheap next year.\n\nWhile it's neat to have the govt step in to help students with paying for college, it only gives colleges an incentive to jack up prices without providing more services. I believe that if the govt steps down on financial aid *gradually*, and more students start paying for college with their own cash, then college should become more affordable for the majority of people.\n\nBut I honestly don't know anything, I'm not an economist or politician so not sure if that would be a possible solution.",

But also keep in mind that generally federal financial aid goes to those who need it most, so if you reduce that then you're likely alienating those people while making college more affordable for those who didn't need federal aid in the first place.",

We should provide financial aid to those with the most hardship, and control how much unis can charge for the rest of the students. Maybe even adjust the cost for each student more progressively, similar to our tax brackets.",

For example, georgia southern just wants students they don't really care how good. But part of georgia techs brand is a higher price college with a higher stature in the public",

I think they're a great school with a strong name, but I don't like how they're trying to become a public Ivy. I appreciate Southern offering a good quality engineering education to more people, along with hands on experience (GT doesn't offer it as much) and plenty of opportunities including undergrad research (again, GT is lacking there).\n\nThe only downside I really see with Southern is the brand name, and that's not too big a deal because I know some graduates who worked their asses off and were able to get noticed by Tesla and FCA, and some other car companies. The school name didn't matter at all.",

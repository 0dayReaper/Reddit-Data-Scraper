If my date doesn't go to GSU can she still ride? If not, can she just give the name of a roommate that does go to GSU or do they check student id's or student #'s? ",

At the end of the day, they\u2019re there to help. The goal is to keep everyone safe and off the roads if they don\u2019t need to be, but they\u2019ll take you anywhere in town for any reason. They\u2019ve even taken people to the store to buy groceries. \nI used to work for the SGA in a non-senator/elected a few years back, and designed a lot of the rebranding of it. ",

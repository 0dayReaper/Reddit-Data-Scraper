    "postText": "I\u2019m looking for a student who might be interested in piano/keyboard lessons for my son- he\u2019s 9- ideally someone who maybe willing to have an unorthodox approach to teaching piano. \nHe was really excited when he first started but now he\u2019s bored and I think his current instructor might not be challenging enough for him. \nThis is a paid position, obviously, probably starting in May. \nI\u2019m a student on that campus. DM me for details if you\u2019re interested",

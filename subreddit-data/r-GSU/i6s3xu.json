    "postText": "I'm a Senior this year and interested in ever going to Georgia Southern or Georgia State I would like to do Computer Science and I have visited both colleges and definitely love the atmosphere at southern and there seems to be plenty of fun but at the same time southern is in a very small town so it seems like it can get old quick. Georgia state seems like a ton of fun just doesn't have the school pride and greek life like southern.",

            "comment": "Go to Georgia state of you want to feel like you're going to a commuter college. Come to Southern if you want the true college feel. I toured a lot of commuter colleges and its no fun when everyone you know drives to their parents home every day after class and you're one of the only few living on campus.\n\nStatesboro is small, but we do have a pretty nice water park and the most beautiful city and the beach is only 30 minutes away! Savannah made me fall in love with costal Georgia.\n\nLike you said State also has zero school pride. I feel bad for their football team that has to play for an empty stadium every home game.\n\nAlso just remember who the real GSU is! We own this subreddit!\n\nI'm also in a STEM major. Let me know if you have any questions!",

I knew others that never went out with us and were bored out of their minds in the Boro. By my junior year I was spending a lot of time in Savannah and made lots of friends at SCAD. If I needed the city feel I just went and hung out in Savannah for the weekend at their places. I grew up in metro Atlanta and had the same fear that I'd be bored.",

Statesboro is on a completely different level that's really only applicable for people 18-25. 18-22 mostly. Type in Georgia State Party on Youtube and then do Georgia Southern party.",

I hate my hometown and want to live in the opposite of it but you do make a very good point.",

College has a completely different feel than high school. It\u2019s night and day, so don\u2019t worry about the small town aspect. Plus you can always drive to Savannah if you feel the need, it isn\u2019t far. I think in all my time at Southern we only went to Savannah 10 times. It was expensive (for a broke college student) and we always had something going on. \n\nI know the bar scene isn\u2019t the same down there since the Rude Rudy incident, so I don\u2019t know exactly how it is now. But one thing I do know is college students are resourceful when it comes to having a good time.",

If you have a few activities or clubs you're planning on joining, or if you're good at making friends, go there. Statesboro is its own closed ecosystem, so if you don't have any friends there, that's it for you. Atlanta has a ton of shit going on everywhere, like any major city, which also means a lot of noise and congestion.",

            "comment": "Listen, I love my school, but I did not like the CS program here. CS is a difficult program in general, but it's made harder by the fact that many of the professors are not empathetic towards their students. Many people switch because they just can't learn from professors who act like they hate their job, and those who stay have told me they wish they hadn't.\n\nHowever, the IT degree genuinely is a good program (what most CS majors who switch change to) with some great professors, and the Computer Engineering degree is new with small class sizes if you want that personalized approach. I also don't know how our CS program stacks up to State's. Maybe ours is still the better one at the end of the day. \n\nThe campus is beautiful, and going here does give you the \"real college experience.\" The Greek Life and college football are better, but we only have 4 bars (some people may say more, but it's debatable) and parties tend to get busted pretty quick. For how you may feel about Statesboro: most people from the Atlanta area go home during breaks, while most people from anywhere else in Georgia stay.",

I would like to join greek life and get the real experience I don't see that happening at State but on the other hand things like the insane internships I can get at State make me very intrigued. Assuming by your wording you are/were a CS major how were the internships in Statesboro?",

There's not really any internships that are located in Statesboro for you to do part-time while taking classes. Most people get one during the summer, and it's a good way to get out of town. Also, IT requires an internship to graduate; CS does not.

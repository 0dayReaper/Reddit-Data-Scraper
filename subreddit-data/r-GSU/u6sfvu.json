They change their names a lot to throw off bad reviews. \nIdk anyone who\u2019s lived north of campus. Far East of campus isn\u2019t bad. Low income housing is on the north side of the city and south. North abs south side is very low income, ie you could get robbed or you may see something. Middle area is safe but don\u2019t be surprised if you see low threat domestic stuff.",

It\u2019s a smaller complex across the street from campus so you could walk there depending on where your classes are. There are monthly events that the front office puts together where they do give aways sometimes. No complaints at all.\n\nThey are 2 person apartments so you do have to have a room mate. But you have separate rooms and separate bathrooms\n\nEdit: wow seems like people don\u2019t like the George! They recently got bought by the Hudson and are transitioning to more student life stuff. I think it\u2019s great there. Lived there for 2 years now and never had a problem. Maintenance upkeep is great. Front staff is great. Monthly events are great. Relatively quiet place these days I guess!",

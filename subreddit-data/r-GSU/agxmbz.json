    "postText": "&gt;Georgia Southern University is excited to announce some changes to our commencement activities. These changes will allow us to balance the size of the ceremony, respect participants\u2019 time, and honor the overwhelming desire to recognize each graduate individually.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After much discussion across the University, Georgia Southern will begin a new tradition this Spring with two ceremonies for students:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Each college will hold its own ceremony where every graduate will be recognized individually. This ceremony will be led by the college dean and have greater involvement from the faculty, allowing the university to better focus on student academic achievement. This ceremony will heighten the academic distinction students have achieved and allow for recognitions such as Doctoral degree hooding and honors designations.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There will also be a University-wide ceremony where graduates are recognized as a group. This ceremony will include all the colleges and have the full pomp and circumstance of a traditional ceremony, including a guest commencement speaker.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Creating the college-specific ceremonies allows students and faculty to stay connected, and provides a more appropriate environment for a personal celebration as the university recognizes each graduating student as they walk across the stage. Changing the University-wide ceremony allows Georgia Southern to preserve the dignity of the event, while also managing its size. This spring, we are expecting to confer more than 4,000 undergraduate and graduate degrees.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The University-wide ceremony will be held May 11 at 9 a.m. in Paulson Stadium on the Statesboro Campus. The college-specific ceremonies will take place on May 10 and 11. These ceremonies will vary in length and format depending on the college and will be held in the same location of the college\u2019s campus.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For more information and for details on these ceremonies, some of which are still be being finalized, go to\u00a0[**https://www.georgiasouthern.edu/commencement/**](https://www.georgiasouthern.edu/commencement/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "I'm faculty, so my opinion on the whole thing doesn't matter nearly as much as that of students. \n\nThat said, I really like the idea of splitting graduations up into smaller ceremonies based on colleges. the announcers will get to spend more time on each name and announce individual majors. \n\nWhat I don't care for is splitting some of the predominantly Statesboro-based colleges and having them do graduation in Savannah. But that's mostly because I don't want to drive to Savannah. \n\n",

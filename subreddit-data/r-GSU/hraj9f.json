People learn in different ways, some students might excel but obviously most of the students at GS didnt enroll to do classes online. So as a student, albeit no longer at GS, i think the desire for in person classes goes farther than just the university's desire for $",

We can\u2019t all afford 2 weeks off of we get sick. We can\u2019t social distance the classrooms and masks work better with social distancing. I\u2019m a smaller major, and senior at that. We get small class rooms filled to the brim with the students that need to take it. There\u2019s no way to social distance that. I\u2019m already at risk from working with the public as is.",

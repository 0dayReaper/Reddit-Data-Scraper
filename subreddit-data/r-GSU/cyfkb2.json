The Armstrong campus might face a longer closer, but I doubt Statesboro will. \n\nIt seems like the cancellations are mostly just in case the thing wobbles back westwards over the next 24 hours.",

When Hurricane Matthew passed offshore like this, there was significant damage to Armstrong campus and no power for a week or so. It was only a category 1. I'm at Armstrong which is in a mandatory evac zone and I got reservations out of town for the whole week. They didn't even let people who evacuated from Matthew return to Savannah until two days or so AFTER the hurricane passed because there were too many downed trees, power lines, too much flooding, etc.",

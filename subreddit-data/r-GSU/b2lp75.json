He's super smart, excellent student, has already been invited to the Honors program at GSU.\n\nSo, I'm asking all y'all: what do you suggest? Do you love GSU/Statesboro? Have you been to attneded UGA? Why do you think GSU would be a better choice over UGA?\n\nCouple relevant details: His current GF is going there, as is a couple of buddies (he has few if any going to UGA). As of now he says he wants to study nursing (recent decision).",

In that case, I\u2019d say, let him go to Southern. Transferring is a hassle, but the Nursing program is no joke at GSU and he could figure out that both the GF and major aren\u2019t for him... so he just gets his core out of the way and transfers to UGA where he walks away with a degree from Georgia while getting a great education at two great institutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*sigh* That\u2019s the end of my political response. Now I\u2019ll just end with THWG! HAIL SOUTHERN AND NO PLACE ELSE!\n",

Her and her roommate were filling out applications to UGA w/in the first week of School, and she laughs all the time about how dumb that was. I ended up at Southern because they threw money at me, but I can say with total conviction that I love that school and Statesboro. To be honest, Athens is an amazing town, but sending an 18 year old there is something to be taken with a grain of salt. I adore living in Athens as a 21+adult, but we've talked before about how Southern was just a completely better experience for undergrad than what my wife and I had at UGA. \n\nThat being said, my little brother was down at Southern for only a year before transferring to UGA to eventually graduate from Terry College of Business there. I don't think he ever gave southern a decent shot, and thought himself too good for the school. Both Universitys are what you make of them, and both have their appeals. Southern would be my choice for undergrad in a heartbeat though. More personal, better interactions with professors, the honors community is great, and gnats landing beats any college food in Athens.

            "comment": "I would say as to the overall community and student life / enjoyment and unique experience GSU hands down. Athens is cool and all for what it is, but Athens is not a particularly unique place considering the college experience. What I mean is you can live in Athens and experience everything without the the college really. There are also lots of other cities you can conceivably find yourself in that are very similar to Athens with college life not being a part of it.\n\nThe experience of going to school in Statesboro at Georgia Southern is probably one of the most unique experiences you could have with regards to undergraduate college. The Statesboro / GSU experience is completely different from other schools. Statesboro by itself is basically nothing, there isn't really a city / school dynamic to it. While you technically have a downtown there's not really anything there. Athens is a standalone town that has a college as part of it's core. Milledgeville is the same, just like a smaller Athens. \n\nSouthern is a huge school in a town that has nothing but that school. The campus is not integrated into the town. It's all on the side of and bigger than the town. It's also almost completely flat. It's the best biking experience ever, the density is very high in the residential campus core. The weather is just warm enough that you can wear shorts and flip flops all year. Pool parties are going pretty much everyday from March until November. I'm not trying to stress that party aspect too much, but it's there and way more intense than Athens.\n \nSummer school in Statesboro is something there should be a TV show about, except there shouldn't because then everyone would be there and would ruin it. Until humans are capable of time travel and reliving your very best memories repeatedly I don't think there is any other time and place where each day is as enjoyable as summer school in Statesboro.\n\n Pretty much everything on the campus is state of the art and brand new. The only historical buildings are mostly for administrative purposes. All of the facilities are top tier. GSU is a teaching University, money and energy is not devoted in any large portion to research. Class sizes are small, taught by actual professors with real world experience, not TAs backed up by a research guru that's never been in the real world.\n\nOne on one time with some brilliant worldly individuals is readily available. As an example in the business department a couple of my teachers flew in just to teach classes weekly. Their other time was spent working with Fortune 20 companies. I knew of several other students in different departments that were always amazed at the stories and time spent with their professors. My time in Athens I was rarely encouraged to interact with any professors on a meaningful level and often felt that their ambitions were elsewhere using UGA as more of a stepping stone. At Southern the faculty is largely made up of successful retired professionals living in the coastal areas around Savannah that enjoy individual time with students. Georgia State has taken to mimic this experience and while the school / campus life is completely different they've done well to attract impressive staff.\n\nThe job placement and career opportunities for GSU grads are great, especially if you wish to remain in the southeast. If you don't, the prestige of UGA isn't really going to matter if you go further than Nashville.\n\nThat being said, the relaxed, almost vacation like casual atmosphere of Statesboro makes it VERY easy to fall in the cracks. There's almost the same number of non-students as there are students who just live around campus. Even being in the Honors program isn't really going to mean anything. The attrition rate for freshmen is incredibly high. I don't know your kid obviously, but I can certainly see how living on your own, in a new town full of sunshine and alcohol, away from supervision with your high school girlfriend isn't exactly the most conducive to finishing college \"on time.\" \n\nI love Athens, it's a great place, and UGA is a fun and very good school. I still go to Athens and have a great time and have friends working and even still in school at UGA. Statesboro I can go back on game days. Statesboro is entirely geared toward 18-23 year olds. You can experience Athens anytime and still get a lot from it. I wouldn't live in Statesboro today, but wish I could have made the years I did last longer. \n\n",

The only people from undergrad I still stay in contact with were people in the honors program (not that they were better people but more that I built stronger relationships with them because I had more classes with them even if they weren't in my major.) \n\nAlso GSU has a beautiful campus if you like the outdoors, and if your son likes outdoor trips, we have a program at our RAC where he can do kayaking or hiking, etc. It's 45-60 minutes out from Savannah and just past Savannah is the Georgia Islands (always a fun day trip). \n\nThe BIGGEST draw of Statesboro, and one of the reasons I stayed after undergrad, is how cheap it is to live here. The dorms aren't cheap, but we also have great options if your son doesn't want to share a bedroom. But if he moves off campus, there is some really good really well priced apartments. I had trouble finding an apartment at the same price with the same amenities that I have now in other college towns. \n\nAnd, of course, we have a great nursing program! I see other people have elaborated on that. From what I hear, there's a lot of hands on training that's hard to get other places. And if he changes his mind as some students do, there's no shortage of majors to consider. \n\nBut in the end, your son should choose which one feels like somewhere he could live for at least four years. If he comes back to tour again, check out the town, the parks, etc. for both universities. I remember when I toured Tech and UGA, they were great and I loved them, but when I toured GSU, it felt like a future home and I knew I was going here. And I haven't left yet!! ",

            "comment": "I am an honors student in my senior year studying civil engineering at GSU, and my ENTIRE family, and long term girlfriend graduated from UGA with their undergraduate degrees. Here is my 2 cents based on my experience and their experience. \n\nOn paper, UGA does have a good number of programs that look better than Georgia Southerns. However, this is NOT the case with Engineering/nursing. Georgia doesn\u2019t have a nursing program, (I\u2019m confused as to why people are talking about them having a better program??). If your son wants to do nursing, or thinks he wants to do it, Georgia Southern is a no brainer. If he changes his major, studying anything at Georgia Southern is not going to put him in a bad position. He will still have plenty of opportunity if he puts himself out there and makes himself known. \n\nUGA has a much longer, richer history than Georgia Southern, but this isn\u2019t necessarily bad for gsu. We have a lot of modern amenities that UGA doesn\u2019t have, and far newer buildings. If he changes his major to engineering, we have a dedicated Civil/Mechanical building, a separate IT/Electrical Engineering building, an additional laboratory building (on top of the labs in the previous two), and we have a 4th currently under construction. UGA engineering has a single building. We also get real world experience, which is why construction companies are so prevalent at the stem fair (large commercial GCs, think multi million or even billion dollar construction projects). Many people misunderstand that industry, but it can be extremely rewarding and lucrative. My 2nd year internship paid $1000 a week + a $1500 gas stipend. I am also getting flown to Denver for a job interview next week (so it\u2019s possible to move anywhere in the country, just like UGA) and have passed the Fundamentals of Engineering exam. There are GREAT opportunities here, your son just has to be willing to search for those opportunities himself! \n\nI could ramble about this topic for a long time, it is something I feel passionate about. My senior year of HS I was literally brought to tears because the moms of Gwinnett county had given Georgia Southern such a bad name. These same individuals pushed for their son/daughter to follow exactly in their footsteps, join the same fraternity/sorority that they were in, study the same thing, and have their two college experiences be as similar as possible. PLEASE IGNORE THEM! Your son has to make a very stressful decision right now, and what he really needs is for his family and friends to support him no matter what. GSU or UGA, he will grow as a person, meet incredible people, hit rock bottom, be on top of the world, and graduate with a very respected degree. At the end of the day though, this is his decision. If Georgia Southern is what he wants, then don\u2019t try to convince him otherwise. My UGA graduate girlfriend actually transferred to southern to get her MACC (she was accepted into UGAs program), and while she misses some of the aspects of UGA, particularly SEC football, the southern academics have not held her back at all. In fact, she just passed the tax portion of the CPA!",

            "comment": "To start, I\u2019ll reiterate a common point in this thread, GSU has the objectively best nursing program in the state and one of the best in the region. If he\u2019s possibly thinking about looking at other STEM based fields, I\u2019ll add that we have the second best engineering school in Georgia, and fantastic biology related programs (like sports medicine). \nMy favorite thing about Southern is how much the professors actually care about the students. At big schools like UGA the majority of your educator-student relationships are with TAs until you get to your major work (at least according to my friends currently there), where at Southern I haven\u2019t had a single class taught by a TA or Grad Student and almost all of my classes have been in the ~25 person range. Also, as a business major, I love almost all of my profs having had real world experience, rather than being life long academics. Having profs who worked for several years in the field that they are teaching you is extremely helpful since they can teach you exactly what you need to know to succeed.\nAs for how Statesboro is as a town, you get what you make out of it. There\u2019s always sports stuff going on and there\u2019s plenty of cultural events like plays and orchestral recitals. If you don\u2019t look for things to do though, it\u2019s easy to get bored. I will also add about jobs in the boro, it is tough but it only took me a week and a half of 6 applications a day to land a job. It\u2019s fast food, but it pays rent. \nI chose Southern over UGA because I loved the environment and I felt more cared about. I didn\u2019t feel like I would get lost in the crowd here.",

I finally got accepted, but it took them so long to figure it all out that I decided to go with Southern. No regrets.",

To your point about academics not showing the whole picture, GSU offers excellent ROI as both tuition and cost of living are lower than UGA. In my opinion, graduating with less debt and a comparable job is definitely preferable to going to a school that some consider \"better\" on paper.

The entire Education program is also the best in the state and in top in the region. Several of the College of Business programs like Logistics and Supply Chain Management (One of the top 20 in the world) and Accounting (Specifically Forensic, but also over all). I would also add that our Biology Department is very comparable to UGAs, and we offer plenty of student field research opportunities. Now if there\u2019s a chance that he may flip entirely and change his major to something like music or agriculture, then yeah I would put more emphasis on UGA.",

How is he paying for it? Loans, cash, cost of living?\n5. Employment. Is he going to work while in school? It was near impossible to get a part time job in Statesboro because it's a SMALL community and EVERYBODY wants a job. In Athens? Not so much.\n\nMy favorite thing about Georgia Southern was that it felt like a college town. The town lived, breathed, and grew with Georgia Southern. There wasn't really a line between Statesboro and GSU. In Athens, the city and school depend on each other, but I don't think it's as interdependent as GSU/Boro is.\n\nTo end, I've lived in Athens for 7 years now and i I had the opportunity, I'd move closer to Statesboro again.",

I came across this thread after my boyfriend (who has also commented), so if you see any similar information, that\u2019s probably why. \n\nI attended my undergrad at the University of Georgia where I had the most amazing four years money could buy (literally). I definitely think this is a decision that needs to be made by your son, but I have no doubt he has an eye on this thread.\n\nTo begin, I studied accounting in my undergrad, and when it comes to business, I have a place in my heart for the Terry College of Business. I believe the networking at Terry is far more substantial than that that can be found at Southern unless your son has the long-term intention of pursuing a career in the South-east. With that being said, it sounds like your son is interested in nursing, in which case, GSU seems like the obvious choice! UGA does not have a nursing program, and it would be a substantial amount of money to just go there for the core. Additionally, GSU has what I would consider a more prestigious engineering program, so if that\u2019s on his radar, I definitely suggest Georgia Southern. When it comes to any other majors, I would say UGA likely has the upper hand.\n\nSome other things to consider may be any extracurricular activities he may wish to pursue as well as the environment he wants to be in. Georgia Southern is known as having a small school feel, while UGA is a large university through and through. Not only that, but football, as of late, as been incredibly intense at UGA, and some people consider the differences between an SEC school and a Sunbelt school in their decision. Not to mention the costs of attending these respective universities - I was lucky enough to have HOPE during my undergrad, but I still had to take out a cumulative $50,000 in my four years at UGA.\n\nThat\u2019s my two cents on the matter!

    "postText": "Am I the only one who thinks it\u2019s outrageous that our professors can stay at home and do zoom classes but we\u2019re expected to go to class anyway? \n\nIt seems like more and more classes are being set up this way and their justification is that we\u2019re being split into groups so that we\u2019re following social distancing guidelines. I don\u2019t feel safe doing this and I think it\u2019s ridiculous that our professors get to stay home and reduce the risk of exposure and we don\u2019t. If we\u2019re already doing zoom calls, why show up? And if you have online classes that you didn\u2019t ask for, you get charged extra for online tuition. \n\nIt seems like the university is trying to protect everyone BUT the students and honestly I\u2019m outraged. Does anyone feel the same way?",

I\u2019m mostly referring to classes that will already be mostly online and would have no issue being completely online. Specifically, ones that are already doing zoom calls but still make you show up to the classroom. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair when it\u2019s the same quality of education and everything of when you stay home.",

I just wish there were more virtual learning options for those in classes that will be mostly online already or do not necessarily need to be in person at all and could operate online. Sort of like how they were able to do for summer classes.",

Mostly because I know for a solid fact that there WILL be some people without masks and not social distancing. I have asthma so overall it just stresses the hell out. It's like knowing there are gonna be some people too stupid and ignorant to follow simple rules to keep everyone safe, so in the end everyone suffers.",

                    "comment": "Sorry if you already got an answer, but there are a few ways classes will be set up this fall:\n- A class section is split into smaller sections. These smaller class sizes can properly social distance while in the classroom, so they meet as scheduled.\n- A class section is split into smaller groups and these groups rotate between in-person and online via Zoom. Ex: Class that is scheduled for MW is split into two groups. Group A is in-person Monday while Group B watches the lecture from home via Zoom. Group B is in-person Wednesday while Group A watches the lecture from home via Zoom.\n- A class section is split into smaller groups, but rather than rotating between in-person and Zoom, each group only has class once a week in-person. \n- A class is completely moved online, no Zoom lectures. \n- A class becomes an \"off campus\" class aka it is an online class with Zoom lectures.\n- A class is in-person, but the professor teaches from home via Zoom. (No, seriously. I have one of these classes.)\n\nThere's honestly probably more ways they're doing this too, and it just depends on the initial class size, the amount of professors that can teach a class, and what each professor is comfortable with. All of my classes are either rotating or only meeting once a week, but I know a girl whose classes all went online this semester.",

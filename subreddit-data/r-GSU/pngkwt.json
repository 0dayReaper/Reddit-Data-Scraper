Many faculty have elderly family members at home, young children who cannot be vaccinated, or other family members who may not be able to be vaccinated. Every day that they come into a classroom with unmasked students and no social distancing, they are risking the lives of their entire families. \n\nWith regard to other teaching options: GSU (and apparently the entire University System of GA) is refusing to allow faculty with health issues to teach remotely. This is a whole other struggle that faculty with health issues are dealing with right now. \n\nIn essence, faculty have one choice: either put themselves and their families at risk, or quit and give up the paycheck that they need to support their families. This protest is really the only option they have to stand up and speak out about this.",

Once it figures this out, it remembers what steps to take to protect itself in case it sees the virus again in the future. \n\nThe vaccines pretend to be the virus, letting your body learn how to identify it and how to react to it without it causing any actual damage to you. After being vaccinated, if the real virus enters your system, your body will be able to recognize it quickly and know how to start fighting it right away. \n\nThis works really well with viruses that don\u2019t replicate quickly, but that\u2019s a problem with COVID. It replicates quickly (especially the Delta variant) so while an unvaccinated person\u2019s body is trying to figure out what antibodies to produce to fight it, the virus overwhelms their system. This is why those with weakened immune systems are at much greater risk. \n\nVaccines are not a magic shield. Vaccinated or unvaccinated, the virus can still enter your system. Vaccinated people\u2019s bodies are just able to react to it much more quickly in order to get it under control and beat it down before it gets too bad. This also means that both unvaccinated and vaccinated people can spread it if it has already entered their systems. In both cases, symptoms may not show until several days after you contract it, and you are still contagious during that period. This is also why masks and social distancing are so important toward slowing the spread.",

Almost no vaccine works as a invisible shield that keeps whatever virus/infection totally out of your body. What it does is make it so your own immune system is trained to attack it when it *does* get inside your body. \n\nThe primary effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines is in making it so that if you are exposed to the virus and end up \"getting\" it in the sense that your body reacts to it enough you test positive, the symptoms will be far, far less severe. And you can see that in the differences between \"breakthrough cases\" count and the hospitalization/death rate among the vaccinated. While we are seeing breakthrough cases -- vaccinated people testing positive -- most of those folks feel crummy for a few days, then test negative. Unfortunately, that means that the vast, vast majority of hospitalized people are unvaccinated, and nearly all the deaths are the unvaccinated. \n\n&gt; How are we going to make this thing go away if the vaccines don't get rid of it.\n\nI think the nerds are still working on this one. We may not ever make it go away, though. It may be that this thing sticks around for a few decades, and vaccines for it become like the yearly flu shot.\n\nOne thing that will really, reaaaaaally help us all out is getting everybody vaccinated. Vaccinated people spread the virus at a much lower rate than the unvaccinated. \n\nSo please get vaccinated if you're not already.",

However, vaccinated people appear to spread the virus for a shorter time: For prior variants, lower amounts of viral genetic material were found in samples taken from fully vaccinated people who had breakthrough infections than from unvaccinated people with COVID-19. For people infected with the Delta variant, similar amounts of viral genetic material have been found among both unvaccinated and fully vaccinated people. However, like prior variants, the amount of viral genetic material may go down faster in fully vaccinated people when compared to unvaccinated people. This means fully vaccinated people will likely spread the virus for less time than unvaccinated people.\"\n\nAND\n\n\"Given what we know about the Delta variant, vaccine effectiveness, and current vaccine coverage, layered prevention strategies, including wearing masks, are needed to reduce the transmission of this variant\n\nAt this time, as we build the level of vaccination nationwide, we must also use all the prevention strategies available, including masking indoors in public places, to stop transmission and stop the pandemic. Everyone who is able, including fully vaccinated people, should wear masks in public indoor places in areas of substantial or high transmission.\"\n\nSo I'm curious what data you're looking at.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/delta-variant.html",

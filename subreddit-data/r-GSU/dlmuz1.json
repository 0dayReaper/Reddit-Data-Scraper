While they are fully vested police officers, their primary function is to act as security for the campus and maintain safety there. The employee at the library is not there to secure the campus personally, only to report. Contacting campus police is what should have been done. The officers treated the children with respect as they did their mother when she arrived.\n\nThese kids do not pay to use the library. They don't have student fees to buy electricity, new books, hire employees, and all sorts of other things.  It is also inconsiderate of that parent to assume that the librarian is there to babysit her children while she has something better to do herself.  It doesn't matter if they were being good or not.  They were taking resources (the computers they used) away from students that could have needed them.",

When I was their age, I went and hung out at the local public library, including the one on the public community college campus, *all the time*. Usually it was just to do homework or read, but also they had broadband Internet when we only had dialup at home.",

I really see little wrong with what essentially amounts to taking your kid to work when the public K-12 schools are closed (as they were last week when this incident occurred).\n\nA 15 year old doesn't require 'babysitting' or any active attention of employees there. If it were a 6 or 8 year old and you couldn't contact their parents, sure, maybe call the police.",

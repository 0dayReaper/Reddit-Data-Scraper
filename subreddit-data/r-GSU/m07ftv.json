            "comment": "Unfortunately, I think I have to answer a few of these questions with some other questions... \n\n&gt;Is there anything I should be mindful of before committing? \n\nAre you considering some other schools or specific majors? Is Southern an acceptable distance from home? (Not too far, not too close)\n\n&gt;What are the pros and cons of GSU based on your experience?\n\nVersus other schools? Or not going to college? Or...what? \n\n&gt;Does it feel overwhelming because of the large student population? \n\nAre you easily overwhelmed by a large number of people? Most major-specific classes are going to be with smaller groups. Courses required for everyone may be in large auditoriums with 200 or so students. There are often a lot of people walking around campus at the same time. The dining halls may be fairly crowded at certain times of day. \n\nNone of these things bothered me. I liked them all. But you have to analyze yourself a bit. How many people are at your high school? \n\n&gt;Do you feel like you have a \"place\" at GSU?\n\nI graduated in 2016, but felt like I had many \"places.\" I had physical places: in the lab doing research work, in the manufacturing building, at the climbing wall in the RAC, throwing a frisbee at sweetheart circle, etc. I also had a place with many different friends in those places that enjoyed doing similar things or had the same classes as me. \n\nHappy to chat about it more!",

I think I can adjust to a large number of people. I guess I am concerned about just being a \"number\" rather than a student. If I needed help, could I get it?\n\nThank you",

The biggest difference is in the feel of those campuses. Have you visited Georgia Southern and taken a tour of campus? \n\n2. My pros and cons list would mostly have to do with the areas surrounding campus. For instance, I did not want to go to college in Atlanta, so fake GSU was out for me. Statesboro is not a large city. On a given weekend, your options for fun include laser tag, bowling, playing games at the RAC, hanging out around campus, a few community events like the farmers market, or student group activities that might be going on (of course, if you join Greek life, there are additional things you might be doing but I did not choose to join a fraternity). If you like bigger cities that always have a lot of happenings, this may not be the place for you. Personally, I loved Statesboro. But that's just my preference. It may not line up with what you like. \n\nAlso, know that you can change schools after a year or a semester if you decide it's not a good fit. It's not forever! Except for me. I love Georgia Southern \ud83d\ude01",

There is a bowling alley that has laser tag, bumper cars, and go carts but most of that is closed due to Covid. Savannah is about an hour away and has more stuff to do but gas money is going to add up quickly. Going to the beach Tybee is also an option it it\u2019s about an hour and a half drive away. \n\n2) Again, if you don\u2019t drink you\u2019ll be fine in statesboro. However, if you do drink, Bulloch county is a dry county. This means you have to go to the next county over to get hard liquor. You also have to be really careful with fakes, as many places will take them.\n\nIf you have any other questions, feel free to DM me!I\u2019m a current freshman at the Statesboro Campus majoring in marketing.",

            "comment": "It would also depend on which campus you are going to, Armstrong is a smaller campus.\n\nI would recommend doing a tour of your campus, it will help you decide if it is a good choice for you, they have a bus that goes back and forth between Armstrong and Statesboro, if you have classes on the other campus.\n\nI highly recommend the guided tour, though the self guided one is nice, my family got lost and didn't compete the full tour.",

You'll want to select All Levels, Official Transcript - WINGS\n6. Press Submit\n\n\nIt should then list all of your classes/grades/gpa's by term. If you want a pdf, go into whatever menu you need from your browser to print, you should have an option for \"destination\", like what printer it'll go to. At that selection, you should be able to save to pdf. The \"Print\" button should then turn into a \"Save\" button, and you save it where ever you need to.\n\nmaybe that helps?",

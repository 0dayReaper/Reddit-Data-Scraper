One of her quotes was apparently \"Don't trust the tears of a white woman.\" If someone said that about any other race people would respond the same way. Burning books to burn books or to stop the spread of knowledge is very bad obviously, but I whole heatedly think that what these students did was justified and right.\n\nEdit: She also apparently joked that there was a shooter in order to get students to calm down.",

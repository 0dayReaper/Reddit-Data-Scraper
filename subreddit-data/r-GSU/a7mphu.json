He may have a shot with the Eagle Incentive Program (EIP), though. Also take a look at doing a year at East Georgia, still in Statesboro, and then transferring into Southern. \n\nRetaking the SAT would help if he could get into the 900s, but that's a pretty low GPA. But yeah, definitely look into EIP and East Georgia as possible solutions. ",

That's not a personal affront to his worth as a person, it's just statistics. Universities all have entrance requirements. If you meet them, you're likely to be accepted. If not, it's far less likely. \n\nHe has other options if Southern truly is his dream school.\n\n- Eagle Incentive Program (EIP) would allow him to take summer courses before what would be his first Fall semester. If he does well enough in EIP, he would be accepted and would begin at GSU in the Fall. \n\n- East Georgia State University is a sister school to Georgia Southern. Many people who do not qualify to attend Southern at first go there for a year first. They work their asses off and get good grades so that they can transfer in to Georgia Southern. For many, this is a great way to save money and achieve their educational aspiration of attending GSU. Furthermore, while at EGSU, you have access to all Georgia Southern facilities and services, including student tickets to football games.\n\nHis dream isn't over. He's not being unfairly denied anything. I would've been turned down from some schools based on my numbers, and that's just how college admission works. Sometimes to achieve things you're not qualified for, you have to put in the extra effort to make it happen. If he's not willing to put in the time in EIP or at East Georgia, then Southern wasn't his dream school. It's fine if he doesn't want to pursue those other options, but if he truly wants to get in, he's the only one capable of putting in the work. No random internet stranger can fix that.",

If only one of his SAT scores was in the 400s then he'd still only have a 1/50 shot of getting in with those numbers. A year of community college never killed anyone.  All he needs is 30 hours (I recommend no more than 16/semester) and a C average in that first year. Remind him to use ratemyprofessor so that he can avoid potential 'weed out' teachers to keep his grades up.",

You can\u2019t get in on ambition alone because there are standards. Would you hire someone that does not meet qualifications but he really wants the job? He can apply to EGSC which is a fine college that is allowed to have classes at and use GSU facilities. After one year he can transfer all of his work over and then start on engineering while graduating on time. I hope you relay this information to him and explain what his options are. Or you can refer him to this subreddit and we can help him directly.",

It\u2019s the equivalent of about a 70-72% average across 4 years of high school. One or two bad classes doesn\u2019t explain that away. No amount of extracurriculars can help that. He\u2019s in the 21st percentile for the sat. That score is barely double what the absolute lowest score you can achieve on the sat. There is nothing wrong with community college. But to beat your head against a wall of people trying to give you advice will not win you friends here. The truth is your nephew will almost assuredly not be admitted with that combination of GPA/SAT. Push him towards a community college, get him to put his nose to the grind stone to study and do well, and then transfer. That\u2019s his recourse.",

And even those that fought for the Confederacy without slaves still fought for white supremacy, and to continue using slaves for the hard work of the South's thriving agricultural economy.\n\nThis is coming from someone who's family had to take a long hard look at itself to learn that you can be proud of a place, and not it's politics. We just want to move forward from that time in history, and I know my family isn't the only former Confederate family. A plaque or something would be nice for the statue if it has to stay, but it really doesn't solve anything. It's just another reminder of my familys shameful past.",

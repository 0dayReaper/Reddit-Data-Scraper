            "comment": "Its honestly more about who you know and the connections you make while getting your degree. It doesn\u2019t necessarily matter where you get your degree, if you have talent and are skilled in your field you\u2019ll be successful. But like I said, the more people you know and the connections you make can make a difference in how long it takes to get to that point. Larger universities are going to have a larger alumni base, more students, more professors, professionals already out in work force etc. So the chances of meeting and connecting with others that can help you get to where you need to go will be higher. University prestige isnt as big a deal as it use to be, most places now value experience and skill over the \u201cBig Name\u201d university on the resum\u00e9. But just in terms of numbers larger universities are going to have a lot more people in higher places. More connections = more opportunity. \n\nWith that being said, nothing wrong with a degree from DSU. Just have to make sure you\u2019re networking, meeting people in your field, making friends in your major, and getting to know your professors. Professors can help set you up with internships and jobs post grad. You may even have classmates that go on to work at a place you want to get to that can help get your foot in the door!\n\n-GSU class of \u201819",

            "comment": "Hey! I actually transferred from Dalton State to Georgia Southern a little over a year ago, so here's some things that are different!\n\nPros: \n\nGeorgia Southern has much more school spirit.\n\nGeorgia Southern feels honest to god much easier than Dalton State. Depends on the professor really, but i don't have to try as hard for the same grade I feel like. overall though, maybe 15% easier. nothing huge but i quit having panic attacks when i transferred.\n\nGeorgia Southern's campus is BEAUTIFUL. It is everything I wanted that dalton state's old 90s highschool buildings couldnt give me. lol.\n\nThe people at Georgia Southern are more interesting... I believe that may only be the case because a lot more people go to Southern and live close to campus (or on campus) whereas Dalton State you pass going south on i75. I drove to DSC, I never lived there. Statesboro feels more secluded and more comfortable than Dalton State ever did for me.\n\nthere are frats? I dont know if youre interested in that (i wasnt and still am not) but i dont think Dalton has frats. It was cool to see Greek Row a few times. never walked down it. not interested-- just like that it has that traditional college thing.\n\nDining halls! I dont recall dalton having even one of those. we have two here. and you have to buy a mealplan your first year so youll go to them if you transfer. food is pretty good!\n\nCons:\n\nGeorgia Southern is in the middle of nowhere in Statesboro, GA. You will miss being able to drive to Chattanooga and you will miss the pretty mountain scenery. This place is so flat and barren.\n\nStatesboro is dead if you arent over 21 or have a fake ID. there is nothing to do here but go to bars and parties and smoke shops. Dalton State is a much better location. North of ATL an hour, south of Chatt 45min. East ridge, fort O, ringgold all really close.\n\nYou'll miss home. A lot. especially once you get off campus housing and arent assigned 3 random roommates to keep you company. I live alone with my girlfriend now and it is nice but oh how I missed my family. coming home this christmas was great.\n\nThe drive. Its almost a 5 hour drive of nothing but freeways and it is DREADFULLY boring.\n\n-\u2010------------------------\n\nIn hindsight, I'd still have applied and gone to Georgia Southern. Dalton state did not give me that \"College experience\" I so desperately wanted.\n\nIf Dalton State gets a 7/10, I'd give GSU an 8.5/10. Good college. Dalton is too but Southern is special.",

I would say though if you are interested in software development I would suggest doing computer science. If you do go with IS use the professors to your advantage. If the same professors are there from when I was a student they were all great and can help you out with jobs/internships!",

What separates the rest of colleges from each other is how well they teach (I truly believe in the quality of a good education), and how well connected they are with the industry you're interested in (It's who you know...). I would also seriously try to limit the amount of debt you take on. It can stunt your growth into financial security.",

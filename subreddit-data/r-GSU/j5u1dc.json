    "postText": "Hi, have a son going part-time this semester.   He's trying to get an apartment but I think its better to get on-campus housing for him.  A couple of questions:\n\n1.  Can you move in mid-semester?\n2. What are the meal plans?\n3. Can you do tours now or do you have to wait in-between semesters?\n4. What's the best on-campus housing?",

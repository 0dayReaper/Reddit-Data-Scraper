            "comment": "Going and find the classrooms you'll need to get to before needing to get to them is a big help. You don't want to be walking around a building looking for a classroom and be late.\n\nHave good walking shoes. It's a large campus!\n\nIntramural sports are a great way to find new and like minded friends. So is using the RAC. Plus a regular fitness schedule will help temper the Freshman 15 and help your overall mental health in the long run. Even just walking at the fields I'd recommend to get out and get some fresh air.\n\nA bicycle that you use is a great investment to get around quickly and easily.\n\nYour professors (well most of them) want you to succeed. Their office hours are opportunities to go and talk with them, ask questions about the class, about their field of study. Once you kind of hone in on what you'd like to attempt, you really do build bonds and friendships with the teachers. (In person at least, online is extremely difficult)\n\nGet ahead on work, don't wait until the day before it's due to do it. Time management is one of the most important skills to master early. Thinking about skipping that 8am class? Don't do it. Have an extra few hours and want to nap but have a paper do? Spend 30 minutes researching and then take a nap. You'll thank yourself later. Simple things like that.\n\nIf you trip on the sidewalk, don't worry, it's a thing. They all appear flat but you'll see random people tripping over nothing. You'll get the hang of it.\n\n\nThis is from an old head talking. I went in person around 2008-2010, took a long ass break, and am now finishing my degree via online/remote learning. So in person things might be different.",

However, breaks in between every class really makes your day unnecessarily long. It's better to get your classes done and be done with your day.\n\nMy first semester in college I thought I was so cool with an hour long break after every class. I realized very quickly that the time of these breaks were awkward because they were too long to just wait it out, and too short to go home.\n\nGood luck! I'm happy for you! You're going to love it!!!",

Me personally, I prefer a little bit of a break between classes to let the knowledge settle and go over some of my notes to fully grasp the concept. Going from Calculus to Physics within 15 minutes of each other, I will often forget / misunderstand some of the Calc concepts. \n\nSo, yes this could be good, or not, depending on you. But I'd say an hour max if your schedule allows.",

They'll likely be the first friends you make. \n\nMake healthy choices, learn to cook, go to the RAC, and don't get bogged down by the parties and alcohol or drugs. I'm not gonna tell you not to do it because you can make your own decisions, but don't let it hinder your ability to function and go to class. \n\nCollege is a time for reinvention. If you didn't have the greatest high school experience, this is your chance to start fresh. \n\nIf you're anti-social or very introverted (like me), then don't be afraid to step out of your shell. There are a lot of interesting people to get to know. And it'll help you build connections to new friends and new opportunities. \n\nGeorgia Southern has on campus employment opportunities. You can access the Job portal from MyGeorgiaSouthern.\n\nGet familiar with Folio. It's a bit confusing at first, but you'll be using it for every class. Also, keep up with due dates. No one is going to remind you to do your homework. You're accountable for that yourself now.",

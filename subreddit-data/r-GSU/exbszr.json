    "postText": "It's the 2 bedroom apartment version, rent comes out to about $556 a month. The room itself is the one with the larger bathroom and a regular closet. The apartment is fully furnished and the room comes with  the 40\" Roku TV that was a leasing incentive. [Floorplan](https://lakeviewatmarketdistrict.com/floorplans/2-beds-2-baths)\n\nIt is located behind the neighborhood Walmart (aka Smalmart) and it has an exercise room with a pool by the clubhouse. I had to leave due to medical problems, I would have stayed otherwise.\n\nYou must be someone who is accepting of others. Roommates are an LGBTQ couple, 20-23 years old. They are very kind hearted people that I've known for a long time. They do not party and are generally quiet. I got along with them 100% of the time. They love videogames/cooking/Dungeons and Dragons/music production. The roommate who makes music does so quietly and I've never had an issue.\n\nIf you're interested or know of anyone who needs a room feel free to contact me via PM. Thanks.\n\nedit: the lease expires in July but they are still offering re-leasing deals I believe.",

    "postText": "This isn\u2019t entirely GSU specific, but it is directed mostly towards those of us that are in college.\n\nTo everyone at the Walmart not wearing masks: you have actual problems. For the last however many months, you\u2019ve been idiots, but now that it\u2019s been affecting the university directly for almost a year... you have serious empathy problems. Same goes for the people lining up in swarms outside Dingus at 5 something on a Monday night. Same for anyone else partaking in any other similar situation.\n\nThere are still some people on campus walking around in buildings and testing centers without masks on. These people know they\u2019re about to be in a computer lab or some other type of enclosed space around MANY other people, and they\u2019re fully content not wearing a mask.\n\nI was at Walmart last week. There was this old lady who was getting around just fine, but she was the stereotypical older person at a store: going slow, had her shopping list written on a notepad in red ink, taking her time making decisions. All around her were friend groups bumbling, doing fuck-all, and not a single mask in sight. People like HER are the victims to your recklessness. You and your friends may not be impacted as harshly, but many, many innocent people like her have been taken down by this.\n\nI suppose if you\u2019re content not wearing a mask inside a store, you probably never have been from the jump, and so this post won\u2019t resonate with you in the slightest. I just wanted to vent. Majority of you doing this BS are probably the same ones complaining about nothing going back to normal, but you\u2019re literally the reason why.\n\nIf you have a blatant disregard for those around you, you have no right to complain about a \u201cnew\u201d normal, and you have no right to complain about online classes. If you\u2019re the type of person walking in campus buildings and around stores without a mask on, I hope you\u2019re happy. You\u2019re the reason why we\u2019re rounding around the one-year anniversary of the school\u2019s shutdown last March with COVID still a concern.\n\nEDIT: To those of you who ran across this post/subreddit, welcome to Statesboro! I believe this town alone tanks the average IQ of not only Georgia, but the entire southeast region as a whole. We\u2019re glad to have you.",

Probably more than that, but surveillance data has been iffy, at best. That's basically equal to the annual number of deaths from heart disease or cancer. And thousands more are dealing with long-term health complications after recovery. \n\nI want normalcy as much as anyone else. I want to go have dinner and drinks with my friends. I want to take the kids to the pool. I want to have Sunday dinner at my Mama's house. I want a hug. And masks, hand hygiene, and vaccines are the only way to get there.",

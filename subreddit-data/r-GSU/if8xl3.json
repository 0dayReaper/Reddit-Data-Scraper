    "postText": "Hey everyone!\n\nI'm an overweight guy who's been working on losing weight since we were all sent home last year. I've been on keto and lost about 60 pounds so far, but I really need to start working out here to keep my progress going. None of my friends really workout out and I don't want to start alone, so if you're interested please let me know. My free days would be Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in the evening. \n\nThanks!",

If you get bored with the machines, please come by and ask someone at the wall how to climb! Whether they're an employee or not, all climbers are open to teaching new friends :)",

The RAC has a lot of free classes and activities that are included in your fees, they (used to) have a schedule posted by the turnstiles. I\u2019m a swimmer myself and have found a lot of folks at GSU to swim with, the RAC had a \u201cswim the sunbelt\u201d contest last year where you swam x amount of yard based on the football game scores, it was open to all swimmer levels and there was a good amount of people involved (15-20). I\u2019m not in statesboro anymore but I can refer you to a few swimmers at GSU!",

Don't know how to use anything at gyms besides the bikes, and also don't have friends who workout, so trying to gym alone is too intimidating because I don't have a clue how to use any of the machines (I know I can ask employees, but uhh hi hello social anxiety lol).",

They could start by making testing more available to students - I couldn\u2019t get tested at the health center even though I was exposed to someone confirmed positive. You HAVE to have symptoms. I ended up having to go to Bulloch DPH to get tested (which was a pleasant experience btw if you\u2019re looking for somewhere to get it done).\n\nJust stupid and silly. I\u2019m not saying the blame is solely on the university, because each person that decides to go to the bars and drink personally has a hand in increasing the risk of everyone around here. \n\nWhat the university IS to blame for is being nigh unresponsive throughout the summer, lazily pulling together a last-minute protocol CARES team, not seeing through preparation for their various contingency plans (professors still don\u2019t know to use folio or Zoom), and not making testing something that\u2019s easy-access for students on campus. Literally all of these things are bare minimum standards when you\u2019re talking about swamping 20-30k new people all together at once in a few square miles.",

The fault was on both the students crowding bars for being dumb, and the administration for forgetting that these students are gonna be dumb and deciding to reopen anyway! It endangers not only the GSU community, but the surrounding Statesboro / Bulloch County area. The only \"code or conduct\" being followed is Murphy's Law.",

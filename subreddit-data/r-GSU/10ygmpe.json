All professors I've had have been totally chill and accepting towards all students. I've even had profs who are themselves lgbt+. However...all that said, I've never lived on campus, and don't drive, so if an event on campus is happening during a time/day when I'm not already going to be on campus for class, then I'm not likely to go tbh, so even after all this time at school there I have yet to make any actual friends, so I can't say how hard or easy it is to make fellow queer friends there. It's probably going to be easier if you live on campus and/or are going to events or if you join lgbt specific clubs or something (I think there might be some kind of GSA group?).",

I can guarantee that every other college in America that is our size has at least one racist moron too. I agree with the university\u2019s reaction here and with the reaction to the book burners. They can\u2019t stifle free speech as a public institution. The university\u2019s goal is to educate and change the minds of people. Expelling this kid would only reinforce his ideas and make him angry and further radicalize him. GSU is putting a ton of resources into opening up dialogue about race and politics on campus. The solution to this is issue is to continue opening minds and allowing people to be exposed to new ideas and opinions, not swinging an expulsion hammer at anyone who has bad or radical opinions.",

They were acting on evidence of intent to bring war to the US, and struck first. Antifa attacks otherwise nonviolent protestors because they disagree with them politically. That\u2019s the difference. The Nazi\u2019s posed a physical threat to the US. Yes, the people that Antifa opposes want to enforce inequality and disadvantage, but there is a big difference in inequality and the potential bombing of US cities. Antifa is not the modern day infantry, they are radicalized left wingers that, rather than use debate, reason, and compassion, fulfill their Rambo complex or whatever and go swinging pipes and bike locks at people. I agree with some of the ideas their politics are based on, but I could never support their methods.",

Show people that the \u201cother\u201d that they\u2019re afraid of is full of love and compassion regardless of how they are treated. \nFurther, I want to press that this is not a Georgia Southern issue. You can literally hear his classmates mocking him in the video. Our students by and large do not agree with his ideas. Our administration has shown, by putting their resources on the line, that they don\u2019t agree with him. The best move here is to push education and exposure on our campus. Sending people back to their echo-chambers and denying them the ability to see that there is more out there is how this problem of racism will continue to fester in America.",

First, it\u2019s very interesting that, according to you, the student body here overwhelmingly voted for trump considering roughly half of us in the current student body weren\u2019t old enough to vote in 2016. Now if you mean the student body in 2016, then I would really like to see the numbers you are basing this off of.  Second, this sounds like you are accusing Georgia Southern of being an un-diverse school. I really hate this accusation because of just how false it is. Yes, Georgia Southern is about 62% white. But guess what? The state of Georgia is about 60% white. This means that Georgia southern representative of the demographics of the state that we represent. If you want to actually add something to the dialogue instead of \u201cGeOrGiA sOuThErN rAcIsT\u201d, then be my guest, but stop making generalizations based on your feelings and stop attacking our school.",

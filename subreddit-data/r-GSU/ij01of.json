    "postText": "Yeah, it's quite early to start looking for apartments for next semester, but I'm currently in a single online class, and I'm counting on returning next semester. Screw the Mech.E department for not offering a single class online, but anyway...\n\nI have absolutely no desire to have roommates anymore. Especially given the pandemic. I can't even room with friends if I want to lol.\n\nI understand I'm looking at a *minimum* of $900/month if I get a 1 bedroom. Ideally, I would get a place at Monarch (very close to the engineering building), but their 1 beds sell like hotcakes. I'm thinking about moving to Cambridge or the Hamptons, but if anyone has any better recommendations, let me know.\n\nAnd to make things even more difficult, I would have to take over an existing lease, unless I just wait until next fall...",

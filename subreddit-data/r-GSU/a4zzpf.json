The houses are private not school property so it\u2019s the decision of the alumni housing corporation on what to do with them. They will likely be rented to other fraternities however because both organizations haven\u2019t paid the mortgage off and need the cash flow. They will have to start from the ground up years from now, which is likely best as it becomes a totally new organization free of influence from the current members. ",

Kappa Sig has been here since the 60s so they may just keep paying rent before restarting. Unsure if Delt has the finances to do the same.\n\n\nIt was interesting to see when ATO got kicked off they still had the blessings of their Nationals &amp; owned their land so they kept operating as an unaffiliated organization.",

Professors are professors, some are helpful and some aren't. At any school you go to you'll get to experience the full spectrum. As you get involved in the department, if you choose to do so, youll find that the professors at especially Armstrong are enthusiastic so long as you are also enthusiastic.",

(I\u2019m early education) professors like Dr. smith and Dr. Hobe are amazing, extremely understanding, and kind. There are a few bad apples but most teachers in the department are great. Armstrong only lacks in staff in administration tbh. Financial aid office was inept when I went. But they have a nice gym, a food and period pantry, a decent amount of clubs for such a small campus, and have career fairs and workshops pretty often.",

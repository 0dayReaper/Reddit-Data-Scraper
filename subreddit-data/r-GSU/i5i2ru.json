            "comment": "I started taking this survey but stopped midway through. There are a significant number of typos/grammar mistakes, and you cannot invite groups like alumni to take the survey while asking a number of questions we have no choice to answer in a certain way. For example, if you ask to what degree Georgia Southern has considered my heath and safety when deciding to have in-person classes, as an alumni, I have to answer \u201cnot at all\u201d.  I encourage you to pursue your academic studies. I\u2019m all for fighting for a healthy and safe environment for students and professors, but you aren\u2019t doing the reputations of GSU students or graduates any favors with this. It all comes off as extremely uneducated on the science of taking polls and creating unbiased statistics.",

My tips would just be the standard go to class, take notes, do the work, ask questions if you have any, and spend some of your own time learning/practicing if you want to really get it all down.",

That way you can share/compare notes, talk about upcoming tests, or find out what you missed if you were out. And I know in some IT classes professors didn't mind if you shared old tests, they even encouraged asking people who had taken the class to share old tests. So that could definitely help as well.",

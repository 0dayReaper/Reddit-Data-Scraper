I haven\u2019t attempted to use the shuttle yet this semester, but if it\u2019s reliable, the 6:45 am departure from Statesboro Monday would prevent me from having to catch a ride back to Savannah late Sunday night. \n\nIs there anyone who\u2019s had good/bad experiences so far or that could tell me what to expect?\nIs it mostly empty or should I show up early to make sure I get a spot? I really don\u2019t know how many people have to commute between campuses.",

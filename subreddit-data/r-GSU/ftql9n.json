    "postText": "April 2, 2020  \n  \nGeorgia Southern University and all the University System of Georgia\u2019s 26 institutions will continue to deliver instruction remotely during May and summer semesters, with only limited exceptions.  \n  \nUSG institutions are tentatively planning to return to normal on-campus operations for the fall semester should guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Georgia Department of Public Health allow it.  \n  \nIn the interim, all institutions have been asked to continue their current telework and flexible work strategies for faculty and staff. USG institutions overall have remained open, with only minimal staff physically on-site to ensure continuity of certain services.  \n  \nWe continue to prioritize the safety of our students, faculty and staff as we do our part to help stem the spread of the coronavirus in Georgia and fulfill our mission to graduate our students in these challenging times.  \n  \nWe understand that we are all overcoming many challenges during these uncertain times. The University is committed to your well-being and success. We have several resources available online related to online learning and the University\u2019s response to COVID-19.   \n  \nOnline Learning Resources for Faculty and Students: https://www.georgiasouthern.edu/online-learning-resources/  \n  \nKeep Teaching USG: https://www.usg.edu/keep_teaching_usg  \n  \nCOVID-19 Response Page: https://www.georgiasouthern.edu/covid-19-information/  \n  \nIn addition, we have answered Frequently Asked Questions for students, faculty and staff, and the public. These FAQ\u2019s are being updated regularly, so please check them often.  \n  \nFAQ for Students: https://www.georgiasouthern.edu/covid-19-information/faq-for-students/  \n  \nFAQ for Faculty and Staff: https://www.georgiasouthern.edu/covid-19-information/faq-for-faculty-and-staff/  \n\nFAQ for the Public: https://www.georgiasouthern.edu/covid-19-information/faq-for-public/  \n  \n/end email  \n  \n**Mod note** - Need technology help?   http://its.georgiasouthern.edu/help/  or access the virtual resources page here -  https://its.georgiasouthern.edu/virtual-resources/  \n  \nPlease see the above link. Your best bet to request help or ask technology related questions is to either call the Service Desk, or place a MyHelp support ticket. Either way, you should get help/answers to your question. This can be requesting software on a lab machine on campus, a wireless problem, unable to login to your my.georgiasouthern account, etc..  \n   \nThis also works for other questions not related to technology, such as Human Resources related questions/concerns and soon to be used by other departments on campus.  \n  \nStay healthy and safe everyone.  \n  \nFor those interested in further Covid-19 information please see - https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html",

He's a very straightforward and clear speaker and encourages effort from his students.\n\nEdit: This was out of 3 calculus courses of which were, in order, taught by Stokolos, Ransom, and Nasseh. I probably butchered the name on that last one.",

Very clear and forgiving with assignments and easy to understand and talk to. Bhoi, Ilie, Cesmeci, and Mitra are all pretty good. All of these profs I've mentioned teach the thermo related courses. I also recommend Spencer Harp and Bishal Silwal for your manufacturing courses. Valentin Soloiu is very tough and brash, but will get you into any company you want after graduation if you're dedicated.\n\nWorst: Navaee in MoM and statics is very tough. He also talks during exams which is very distracting. Mujibur Khan is ok for MENG 1310, but terrible for mechanism design. He acts stuck up but you can be on his good side if you show an unhealthy amount of dedication in his class. Fox for Solid Modeling is easy but only if you know SolidWorks beforehand. He doesn't his own tutorials and all lessons consist of SolidProfessor tutorials which are hit or miss.\n\nAnyways, hope that helps",

I\u2019m terrible at math and he was really good about breaking down the complex topics and helping me understand them.",

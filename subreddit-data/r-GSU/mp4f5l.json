    "postText": "Hey, y'all. I am a senior at GSU studying Political Science/International Relations and wanted to put out the opportunity for anyone interested in applying for the [Millenium Fellowship](https://www.millenniumfellows.org/) which is basically a leadership/social impact project run by the United Nations Education Impact (UNAI) focused on the accomplishment of the UN's [2030 Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/). I recently applied to open a chapter of Millenium Fellows on our campus but if not enough people apply from GSU I won't get accepted or neither will I be allowed to start the chapter (they require a number of applicants from each uni). I just wanted to ask if anyone is interested please apply, it's on a rolling basis and the application is really easy. I'm a Model UN kid so if you have any questions feel free to comment or private message me I can help. I'd def recommend to social science majors who want some experience on their resume though its open to anyone, all skills are worthy :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit : Actually it is due April 16th",

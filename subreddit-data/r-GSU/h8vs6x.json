    "postText": "For my first year I stayed in a 2 bed room at centennial place. GSU paired me with my roommate so I didn't have to find anyone to live with. Idk how I can go back in the fall if I can't find a place to stay with roommates in Statesboro so it's cheaper. I would like to live off campus but don't know how I can find roommates. Is there a website or something people use to find roommates? Also if I live on campus will GSU help me find roommates like they do the first year?",

Also try searching on Facebook your class year, there\u2019s usually always people on a page like that looking for roommates. \nMy info might be a little dated tho, I was a freshman in 2015, and then lived off campus at the same place for 3 years.",

If you're wanting to live in a house where you do have to find your own roommates, there's a Georgia Southern facebook page where people are *always* posting \"need roommate\" posts.",

Lots of people looking to fill subleases, find new roomates and /or fill leases if a roommate moved out etc. Also, If you're going into sophomore year, you have plenty of time in the fall to get more involved on campus and meet plenty of new people; so if the fall or spring semester your roommate sitch isn't what you hoped for, you can always move Junior year too! good luck!",

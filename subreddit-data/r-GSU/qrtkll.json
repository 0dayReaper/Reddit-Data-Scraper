    "postText": "I recently just got out of an abusive relationship, and I'm living in my car. I'm a student at GSU, and after moving, my family lives in a motel. My parents had to give away my dog, and I've been just really depressed, and I feel alone. If anyone can help with finances, my cash app is $tortamom. I know things will get better, it's just really hard for me right now.\n\nAlso, if anyone can provide me with housing, I'd appreciate that; I'm willing to contribute to paying rent, or any other bills, if it means finally sleeping in a bed.",

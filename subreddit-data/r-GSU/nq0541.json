They play some games and stuff to try to give people the opportunity to make their first friends.\n\nWhat dorm building are you staying at? Chances are you'll probably have 3 roommates.",

If they have never slept at each other\u2019s houses for a long time, chances are they do not know their habits. Some prefer clean, while others prefer messy. I also witnessed room changes and being an RA last year with these type of mediations were just so terrible. I hope it does work out for y\u2019all.",

The only actual bad parts are (1) the possible heat and (2) the ice breaker games. \n\nAll that to say, it really isn't that bad. You should go so you at least have a bit of a handle on the school and don't feel left behind by everyone else on Day 1 (reduced anxiety is worth every minute).",

Getting a lot of the FAQ stuff out of the way (like \"why can't I choose my own 1st semester classes?\" and \"where do I get my student ID?\" Basic stuff, but important.\n\n2. Answering your parent's FAQs, so that you aren't constantly fielding calls about FERPA, dining services, and so forth. (Parents go to a separate section that gives us a lot of information. It can prevent a lot of helicoptering, depending on the parent/s. That can be worthwhile time spent if your folks are anxious.)",

    "postText": "I never really tracked my fitness in the past, but I'm planning to get an apple watch before I take this class in fall, and plan to try and use it to track fitness stuff. I have a friend who got one somewhat recently, and said she couldn't really figure out how to get it to show any tracking info other than the circles on the clock face. I was worried it might not be ideal for tracking steps or distance for the class, and emailed the professor to ask if apple watch would work for tracking for the class. He said it would work just fine, but to make sure to purchase the course voucher code before setting up my fitness tracker. \n\nWhat is this voucher code for? Is there a specific tracker app that the class uses and this voucher is for that app? The class is just a walking class, so provided the student owns something to track steps with and a pair of shoes already, then there shouldn't be anything we need to purchase for the class right? Why am I needing to pay money to just...walk...? I'm glad he said I can use apple watch like I was planning to, but with the mention of purchasing a voucher I'm now more confused than before I emailed him lol. \n\nI'm also wondering what exactly one needs to do to succeed in the class? Do I have to walk outside, or can I walk on a treadmill, or even in water in a pool? Can I put whatever normal steps I take during the day walking around my house, walking to the bus, etc towards the step count for this class? I'm not really at all into fitness lol, from time to time I exercise and such for the sake of exercising, but 99% of the time I don't care about or forget to track it, and any exercising I get in just comes from whatever I'm already doing during the day (carrying stuff, walking around house, walking to nearby shops, walking around campus, moving around in the pool, etc). I want to walk on the beach, and would go do that often if I had a car, finally got around to asking some friends if they'd like to do that (using this class as the excuse lol) and they said they would, so I'm hoping to be able to do that some for this class as well. But thinking about it now I'm worried maybe phone service might not be ideal at a place like the beach, or if I go hiking or something like that. It's literally been years since I used my old fitbit (probably doesn't work anymore, been wanting to replace it either way, why I'm looking at apple watch), so I don't remember what the deal is with tracking device connecting to phone when phone isn't getting service. If I'm in a spotty service area will tracking devices still connect to their app in the phone ok? I know that's mostly just a trouble shooting question for anyone who's taken the class before, and not really a gsu specific question. I'm just worried about hiccups I might face since I don't really exercise so specifically, and don't usually track it, so doing those things for this class is going to mostly be new for me.",

An annoying amount of busy work for a 3 week course but not hard work at all.",

            "comment": "So fitness walking was by far the easiest A I\u2019ve ever gotten &amp; the best PE requirement I could\u2019ve taken considering I work full time. I don\u2019t recall a \u201cvoucher\u201d but that could be to access the online class as in my class (on ASU) did like 2-4 assignments &amp; an end of semester test. As long as you get your steps in on time &amp; do the required work- it\u2019s extremely easy to do. Wear your Apple Watch everywhere or have your phone (make sure they\u2019re always charged! \ud83d\ude02) and you\u2019ll get your steps faster than you think. I\u2019d get all my steps AND some in at a day of work so I could \u201cskip\u201d a day. \n\nI\u2019d discuss further with your particular professor regarding the voucher &amp; what to expect for the class. But from experience, I\u2019m glad I took this class, it helped me learn small ways to improve my daily life/health, helped me to establish small but healthier habits (not that I wasn\u2019t healthy before but it made me more mindful) and as long as you study for the test- you\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s pretty basic knowledge that you\u2019ll most likely already be familiar with save for a few things you may have forgotten or if you\u2019ve not taken A&amp;P/read up on A&amp;P- basic A&amp;P, I should add. The voucher, I THINK, is to connect your device to their system so your steps get registered in real time and there\u2019s no way to cheat, plus it keeps everything in one place. Keep your own log though, just in case, as you know technology can fail at times. Overall, you\u2019ve got this &amp; it\u2019ll be an easy A so long as you just do it. And make it fun, like you suggested, it\u2019ll most likely open your eyes to how healthy just incorporating a few extra steps can be and you\u2019ll most likely discover some new places because you decided to \u201ctake the long way\u201d to class or something. Just because it\u2019s an easy A (and requirement most likely) doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t enjoy it and learn something! My professors made themselves very available and were extremely helpful/willing to help with any questions/issues (as my class was online.) \n\nGood luck and I hope this was helpful! You\u2019ll enjoy the class for what it is; and like I said, just wait to hear back from you professor regarding the voucher and any other questions you\u2019ve asked. If they don\u2019t get back to you then I\u2019d say sending another email about a week or two before classes begin would be reasonable if you want to be fully prepared ahead of time. They\u2019ll go over everything with you on the first day though and they\u2019ll give you the time you need to acquire/work out everything!",

I took a PE class in high school like 15 years ago lol, but we just played games and didn't learn anything about health or about fitness benefits on health. \n\nThat sounds good! And my professor seems so far like he'll be nice and helpful too. This class seems like a really popular online class (I had tried to get into it in the past to get it out of the way, but they were always full up right away, finally got in early enough this time), so I'm sure the professors have to deal with all sorts of people with all sorts of issues. I have heel spurs, but for the past few years now they haven't really bothered me at all when walking, but I'm still debating asking the professor's thoughts on if it could affect my ability to complete the class.",

So that\u2019s already a good plan and I imagine walking to &amp; from the bus stop has you getting a decent amount of steps in too.\n\nA&amp;P is anatomy and physiology which I would like to point out is not at all necessary to have taken to be successful in this class nor is it a requirement for this course! I just found that previous knowledge from high school PE/health and some A&amp;P topics helped me on the test- so I didn\u2019t have to study that much. But really, you shouldn\u2019t have to study like you might for a chem exam or a history exam; it\u2019s mostly basic knowledge, common sense, and stuff you learned years ago that you\u2019ll have to dig up. \ud83d\ude02 not bad at all so I don\u2019t want to worry you with my comment about A&amp;P. \n\nI had difficulties getting in as well! It\u2019s definitely popular and I think it\u2019s because it\u2019s one of the most flexible classes you can take. Why take yoga at 8am when you can do online fitness walking and get your steps in anywhere? I can\u2019t speak on the heel spurs personally, but my dad has them and he plays golf, is on his feet for his job, and does other things where they should bother him and he seems to be doing well so I think the requirements for the class shouldn\u2019t bother you; but again, I\u2019m not a doctor and I\u2019ve never personally experienced that. I do think this is something important to bring up to the professor though just in case something happens then they know from the get-go. I think you\u2019ll be fine and again, if you\u2019re getting your steps in on your usual commute/walking paths then the class doesn\u2019t require a lot of (if any) strenuous activity where that might become an issue. \n\nThe other commenter also explained the voucher pretty well too! It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve taken it- a couple of years- so things could\u2019ve changed a bit but it is for access to your \u201ctextbook\u201d as well as the step counter record. Financial aid should cover it if that\u2019s something you\u2019re concerned about. When I took the class, it was covered with my aid. But I wish you all the best! And I hope your heel spurs don\u2019t become an issue! It sounds like you\u2019re already doing everything right, preparing, and taking it seriously so I think you\u2019re going to do well in the class. So go on and get that \u201cA!\u201d \ud83d\ude0a",

Though I remember struggling the worst on the skeleton labeling test lol, but that was just due to being bad at memorizing stuff back then. I think I'm better at it now. \n\nThe heel spurs randomly started to bother me out of the blue in the past when I had a job that had me on my feet a lot, but since leaving that job they've been mostly totally fine and don't bother me much at all, and I can still walk around a ton in any day and be fine. It's really only if I'm walking a ton every day for days in a row without any break that they start to hurt. But if I do that, and take a break every two days or something it should be fine. But from what this class seems like, I don't think I'll even have to walk that much more than I already would be anyway, so it should be fine!",

If it's required for you that's fine, but as an elective please don't.\n\nI'm an alumni now and I am so thankful for the fun electives I got to take. When I look back at my college career some of the classes that stood out to me the most is my horse back riding elective and my archery elective. College is all about experiences, so go out there and experience learning something new unrelated to your major!\n\nI get it. Right now you feel like you just want to get your credits and get out of school as soon as possible. But later you're going look back and wish you appreciated your time in school more. Take advantage of the opportunities you have now!\n\nGo out and have fun!",

                    "comment": "I'm taking a bunch of fun electives in subjects I actually am really interested in, for sure! And my other classes in fall are some electives in a subject that I'm debating taking as a minor (the minor is only offered at statesboro, but I'm at armstrong and don't drive lol, so I'm still super on the fence about if I'd want to have to take the shuttle so much to go back and forth just for a minor...I don't have much experience in the subject, especially academically, so taking some electives in it that are offered on armstrong campus will help me decide maybe). \n\nAny PE class I think is a requirement for most or all majors. Fitness walking, especially online like this I think, seems to be the most popular and available one because walking is the exercise that's probably easiest and simplest for most people. So that's why I'm taking this class...just because it's required, and I'm not into fitness really, and I personally find something like calorie counting to be mentally unhealthy for me, so I'm not taking the gym/weightlifting class or the nutrition class that could be taken to fill the PE requirement. \n\nThere was a scuba diving class that sounded really exciting to me and that I thought I'd find really really fun, but it required purchasing extra equipment, and also required off campus weekend trips, and I had no idea if I would be able to participate in those since I don't have a car (and since in my experience so far, especially as an older and off campus student, other students in my classes never want to become actual friends outside of class, even if they are totally willing to chat and be very friendly during class time itself, so I figured I might not even be able to get rides from other classmates to the weekend trips for that class). I had emailed the professor of that class with some questions about these things, but he said he would forward it to someone else in the department to respond to it, and that other person never responded lol. I never really looked at the PE related classes before needing to sign up for one in the fall because I thought they were all going to be very fitness based or very diet/health based (neither being things that interest me or make me feel good at all lol), but knowing that there are sometimes random super interesting activity classes like scuba diving available I think I will check on the PE classes during sing up each semester from now on to see what fun things I could take as electives. \n\nOn another note though, lots of people just don't have the money to, or don't want to spend the money on classes they don't 100% necessarily need. And a lot of people are older students like myself (I'm not super old lol, I'm just in my 30s, but I'm finally sticking with college to try and finish it like 10 years later than I originally was trying to) who just don't really have the time, or don't feel they have the time to spend on classes they don't need, when they're really antsy about wanting to get out into the real world and have the career they want to have, etc. I'm glad I'm taking some electives here and there in subjects that really interest me, but I also would like to start some kind of career soon in my field lol. I'm almost 33. Three of my best friends my same age are literal practicing doctors, surgeons, psychiatrists all with PhDs already, and I'm still like a sophomore in undergrad :/. I know it doesn't matter and every person should go their own individual way in life, but I'd be lying if I didn't say it was disheartening tbh that I haven't started any kind of proper career at this age, like I've wanted to.",

Probably not bowling though \ud83d\ude05, but something of a similar caliber where it's something most people have done or know how to do in general, and is also not a ton of extra physical work. All my memories of bowling as an adult though are just full of everyone else there being super judgemental and more concerned about technique than they should have been (when we were just bowling for fun, not for any actual competition or to learn how to properly bowl or anything), but it was with work colleagues from the job I was at at the time, and they treated me like that at work too :/ so I know nicer people probably wouldn't be like that when bowling, but still...just not to fond of the idea of bowling with other people lol. As a kid though we had lots of bowling parties and it was lots of fun because no one cared about technique so no one was judging each other, we all just wanted to have fun.",

If not, your Academic Advisor will know/will be able to help you with that. \n\nIf you don't know who your advisor is, you can log into MyGSU and (I think) in the middle column (halfway down the page if you're on mobile), find \"Make an Advising Appointment &amp; Plan a Schedule.\"\n\nHope this helps!",

Then, go into your MyGS portal, click on Folio, and complete the Pre-Advisement course. Inside that Pre-Advisement course is a Course Preference form. Once you've submitted that form, your advisor will start working on your fall schedule. The form tells your advisor about any incoming credit you might have, courses you're interested in taking, etc. You have to do all of these steps (in this order) before an advisor will start on your schedule.",

Progressive Insurance, General Motors, Gulfstream, and some others. Hopefully it will get better in the future, but it's pretty sparse. I heard more companies have been coming recently because of the Armstrong merger",

There's a ton of great people on campus, a lot of awesome resources like our Information Technology building, and the professors are all pretty good from what I've seen. My brother is a senior CS major here as well and he's enjoyed every part of it.\n\nAs for the job fair, I can't say with 100% certainty as I haven't attended it personally, but I do know that our school works with big name companies like Gulf Stream as well as a lot of different small companies that'll make it easy to find an internship.\n\nOverall, I really enjoy my time here and I think you will too.\nIf you have any other questions, DM me!",

    "postText": "Hey everyone! For some background: I currently have a 2.78 GPA, a pretty good personal statement, decent resume, and pretty good letters of Rec (one from a professor). I am applying to the M.Ed Counselor Education program. For those who are in the program or know a good bit about it: 1. Is my 2.78 GPA going to weigh me down a lot? 2. How competitive is the program? 3. What is the program/ classes like? 4. How was the application process (how long did the whole process take?) 5. What was the interview process like?",

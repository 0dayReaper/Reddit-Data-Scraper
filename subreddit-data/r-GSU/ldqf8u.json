            "comment": "Former Information Systems (Spring 2020) major here!\n\nInformation Systems(IS) at Georgia Southern is more of a jack of all trades major than advertised because it falls under the College of Business. You basically learn a little bit of Java, SAP, Visio, and SQL, but mainly SAP in addition to the basic curriculum that Business students have like marketing, accounting, basic econ, basic statics, etc.\u00a0 Two things happen as a result: First you're learning a bit less hard technological skills and more skills that would make you valuable in an corporate setting. Secondly this leads Georgia Southern to heavily push consulting on its IS majors.\n\nIf you don't want to do consulting you will definitely have to supplement your degree by learning intermediate and advanced skills on your own, or find a minor that has those courses.\n\nIf you want to do data analysis, try to learn SQL and Excel(For data science add Python or R).\u00a0 More software development? Learn Java. Business Analyst? Tableau, Visio, and PowerBi are probably the way to go.\n\nWith all that said and done, I believe it isn't too difficult finding internships and careers afterwards EVEN if you don't do this. I didn't but that's because at the time I didn't realize how the degree itself isn't enough; you have the skills and experiences that connect you to the job that you want. Most of my graduating class in IS has found jobs though I believe except for the same that had my mistaken mentality. So please talk to your professors(I recommend Gambil if he's still there), go the career center, look at the companies that mainly hire Georgia Southern grads, and spend a long time thinking about what you want to do and what you don't want to do, sadly fulltime student is only an option for so long.\n\nMy biggest regrets are not focusing on getting an internship and not learning the additional skills that would have helped me in an academic environment instead of now where I have to work and learn at the same time. But I'm sure you'll do great!",

While you will feel like you cover a good amount in your course work you do not realize how little you know in the grand scheme of things until you step foot into the work force. \n\nIf anyone is truly interested in this as a career path, you need to be applying for internships ASAP and get in some real world experience.\n\nOf course you can find a job afterwards either way. But to help yourself in the long run learn what\u2019s right for you - try and find an internship. Additionally that experience will help you get a leg up over other applicants and potentially a slightly higher salary at the start of your career.",

                    "comment": "I am going in the opposite direction sort of. I got an AS degree back in 2004 and have been working in this field since then (Consulting mainly now -- hey it pays the best!). I am looking to finish my BS degree at GSU btw. But anyways, what dondon says is very spot on. I did sort of an internship back in my day and it gave me just enough to add to a resume to get an operations job at the CDC. It was a crappy job mostly (it didn't pay well) but I did learn enough to get a job later at IBM and my career took off from there. I would highly encourage the same that while you do learn a lot of Univ. you still will find that you have very little knowledge of the field. The best way to get a leg up is with some experience in any from you can. Best of luck OP, hope you do well in this field!",

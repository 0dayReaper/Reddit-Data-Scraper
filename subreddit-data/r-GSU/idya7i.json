    "postText": "Hello! The Period Pantry at GSU-Armstrong is officially a year old. We have been able to provide 1000s of period products to students and staff that need them. At the moment, the Pantry is managed by 2 senior students. Eventually, we will have to graduate. \ud83d\ude25 We are looking for students to take over the operations when are gone as well as help manage things now. Our plan is to officially incorporate the program into the Student Organizations. We would also like to expand to the Statesboro campus. Therefore, we need an executive board. If you are interested or know someone who is, email us at periodpantrygsu@gmail.com",

I knew I couldn't be the only one, and there had to be something I could do. \nhttps://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/B9LHJUHEE0QM?ref_=wl_share our Amazon wish list or our donation box can be found in the Armstrong student union in front of the Perk.",

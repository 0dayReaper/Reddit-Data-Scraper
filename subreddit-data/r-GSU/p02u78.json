I learned a lot, having come into it with no prior knowledge. \n\nSome classes were better than others, with most being at least good. My personal favorites were Theoretical Foundations and Software Engineering. \n\nSince graduation I have had 2 jobs as a software developer, both at large recognizable companies with great salary and benefits. My friends from the program have found similar success. \n\nI will say though, it is not easy. Some classes led to many long nights working on tough projects. \n\nTL;DR: Great program, for the most part. Learned a lot, though some classes were very tough",

The building itself is not damaged and there were no injuries.\nYou should not attempt to enter the building until further notice. If you use the building routinely, please contact your faculty member or supervisor for further instruction.  \n  \nThe way it is written, I'd assume no, as they'll be needing to do quite a bit of cleanup.",

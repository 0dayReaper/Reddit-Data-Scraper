    "postText": "I'm coming back in August for one semester and I'm looking for an apartment that includes utilities and preferably has furnishings as well. I've rented at Hawthorne/The Hamptons/The Vault before so that's my rough expectations. Does anyone know a good site to use to find a room/roommate?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I'm posting I might as well ask if anyone here might be looking for a roommate right now. I'm a male senior biology major who plays a lot of video games, long boards, bikes, hikes, and other things. I'm quiet, don't like to party much, and I value a clean apartment. I do partake in /r/trees so if you smoke as well or don't mind that then great! If you have an animal that's totally fine with me as long as it's cleaned up after. Hit me up with a PM if you're interested.",

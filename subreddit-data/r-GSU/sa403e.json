    "postText": "Anyone else bothered by the lack of quality and options at the dining commons recently? Coffee bar closed, no more steak / noodle bar, vegan bar closed\u2026 i\u2019m beginning to question if it was even worth it this year. \n\nI went this morning around 9:30, an hour after they\u2019re supposed to open. The doors were locked. I waited for about 10 mins before a manager came out and posted a sign that said they wouldn\u2019t open until 11. Wtf. \n\nI signed up this year because I\u2019m a busy senior and live nearby, so I thought it would be a convenient option. I guess I was wrong.",

It felt like people avoided Lakeside like the plague. The food was always WAY better, the staff was WAY nicer, and the options were always cooked fresh and not sitting out all day. Plus, it was usually pretty empty. I would only ever go to Landrum/Dining Commons if there was no food at home and it was late/weekend.",

The only improvement that came out of the pandemic was the ability to get to-go. They don't even do the allergy friendly station anymore, so they REALLY need to stop advertising it on the walking tours. (Yes I've seen ambassadors do that)",

I am splitting it up over a few posts. \n\n* * * \n\n**Racist Incidents, Budget Cuts, and Faculty Warnings: Inside the Run-Up to a Campus Book-Burning**\n\n*By Lindsay Ellis JANUARY 13, 2020* \n\nChris Caplinger left his phone outside the bedroom that night in October, so it was only when he awoke early the next morning that he saw the text. It came in just before midnight, and it carried alarming news: Students are burning a book.\n\nCaplinger knew immediately what book. Whose book. The night before, an author named Jennine Cap\u00f3 Crucet had given a talk at Georgia Southern University, addressing white privilege and sparking an outburst from students. Freshmen read her book as part of the university\u2019s first-year experience program, and Caplinger, who had long directed the program until August, had been heartened afterward when he saw some students approach Crucet with questions and requests for autographs.\n\nBut the tension hadn\u2019t eased, Caplinger saw that morning. It had spiraled out of control.\n\nOn a campus grill, students had set Crucet\u2019s book on fire, clutching clusters of pages as the flames spread. A woman wearing Georgia Southern apparel looked giddy nearby, and soon enough, users on Twitter sent images of the book-burning to Crucet herself. It was a chilling display: A terror often associated with Nazi Germany, unfolding on an American college campus.\n\nPhotos and video of the students\u2019 actions were shared across the university, then across the country, and then the world. The actions, at least to the public, made Georgia Southern synonymous with intolerance. Even in a year saturated with explosive political division, these images were a horrifying low point.\n\nThe narrative that circulated was painful, an indictment of campus culture at a predominantly \u2014 and historically exclusively \u2014 white campus. But in the incident's aftermath, outside of the public eye, faculty members have put much of the blame elsewhere. A lack of preparation, budget cuts, and insufficient foresight unwittingly spread the kindling for the spark that would come.\n\nThis is a complicated era for colleges, which increasingly recognize the importance of diversity programming. But they are also charged with balancing tight budgets and face scrutiny of their political atmospheres. The run-up to the Georgia Southern book-burning is a cautionary tale, at least the way some on campus tell it: Fail to put your money where your mouth is, and the consequences can be stark \u2014 even with the best of intentions.\n\nBefore the fire, before the talk, before the new students even arrived on campus at the beginning of 2019\u2019s fall semester, Caplinger knew Georgia Southern couldn\u2019t possibly include everything about diversity in its first-year experience course.\n\nBut his instinct was to try anyway \u2014 at least to start a conversation on campus. He didn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t have, anticipated where it would go.\n\nIn the fall of 2018, student and campus leaders at Georgia Southern agreed on one thing: The university needed to do something about campus displays of racism.\n\nOver the summer a student had used the N-word as she described photos on her black future roommate's Instagram. A screenshot of her text message went viral. The student-government association advocated for more curricula about diversity and inclusion in response to the events. Days later, the student newspaper reported that a professor used the N-word in the classroom, making the problem more urgent.\n\nThe university commissioned a report that semester on diversity, and it brought more than 200 angry comments from students. \u201cComments included calling for \u2018the building of walls,\u2019 comparing \u2018diversity and inclusion to a mental disorder\u2019 and calling for a stop to any conversations \u2014 for \u2018racial and gender equality to be stamped from existence,\u2019\u201d the report\u2019s writers described.\n\nThe consultant behind that report came to campus that fall semester, and Caplinger left one of his presentations thinking that the first-year experience could be a forum for these discussions. Most students are required to take the two-credit class, which Caplinger had directed since the mid-2000s, in their first semester on campus. The program\u2019s curriculum had been revised many times over the years, and requiring diversity- and inclusion-learning outcomes, he thought, could be a part of the next iteration.\n\nGeorgia Southern isn\u2019t alone in integrating these issues into a program for new students. About 74 percent of institutions have a first-year seminar, according to a 2017 survey from the University of South Carolina, and about half of campuses included objectives connected to intercultural competence, diversity, and engaging with difference.\n\nBy the end of the fall semester, the university decided the first-year experience would include new requirements on diversity. Georgia Southern assembled a committee to draft learning outcomes for the class, a group that decided students would examine identities, consider the different experiences of \u201cprivileged and minoritized\u201d identities, and discuss common ground between the groups. One outcome, the group decided, was to articulate \u201cthe challenges and rewards of interacting with others who differ from themselves.\u201d They also added a new outcome on free expression.\n\nThere were limitations from the outset \u2014 with a packed course, instructors may only have time for a few sessions on diversity and inclusion.\n\nSeveral professors wrote in a feedback form obtained by The Chronicle under state open-records law that they thought the program, though well intentioned, was overextended. One wrote: \u201cI am seriously concerned that this is an unreasonable number of specific outcomes to expect for a two-hour course \u2026 it is more effective to target fewer outcomes, reiterated multiple times and via multiple teaching and assessment strategies.\u201d\n\nThe content, too, raised concerns. On the form, one faculty member wondered how to measure diversity as a learning outcome, and another thought colleagues would \u201cbalk\u201d at training required to teach it. \u201cThe wording of the outcomes seems fine,\u201d another person said. \u201cThe challenge will be in delivering. These are some of the most complex issues we face, and few of us on the faculty are prepared to fully engage them.\u201d\n\nOne professor, who responded anonymously to a survey after piloting the course in the spring, said their students recoiled from the activities set out in the curriculum. A \u201cWho Am I\u201d classroom activity required students to talk about their identity categories in race, sexuality, and religion. Their students found it awkward, almost dehumanizing, the professor reported.\n\nThat professor agreed that incorporating diversity efforts into instruction was important. But they worried that, delivered inadequately, the teaching could build \u201cresentment\u201d around these subject areas.\n\n\u201cRequiring all FYE instructors, regardless of education or training, to attempt to implement these outcomes in a class of students who are often resistant to and disengaged from the course to begin with is more likely to result in students walking away with a more negative view of the ideas in the outcomes than they started with,\u201d that person wrote.\n\nCaplinger saw the range of feedback, and he acknowledged the issues. The program couldn\u2019t devote 30 class hours to diversity issues, and there was always potential that something could go off the rails.\n\nBut that was not a strong enough rationale to simply back away. This wouldn\u2019t be the last piece of diversity and inclusion curriculum that students would encounter, Caplinger later said, so it didn\u2019t need to be exhaustive. And the task force had discussed possible ways instructors could be prepared to lead these conversations.",

                            "comment": "Diversity education takes money. But Georgia Southern was trying to find places to save. The university\u2019s state system, the University System of Georgia, had been reviewing administrative activities across its colleges, trying to find areas to cut costs. Caplinger heard around March 2019 that money for the first-year experience would likely be on the chopping block.\n\nThese cuts were major, more than halving the budget for the program.\n\nIn the 2018-19 academic year, Georgia Southern spent about $1 million on a category that primarily funded course-instructor pay, according to a budget obtained by The Chronicle. That line item fell to about $33,000 the next year. The budget for the program over all fell from $1.9 million to about $860,000 in the same time period. Christine Ludowise, an associate provost for student success, said that money was funneled to help mitigate salary disparities between faculty and staff at Georgia Southern and those at other universities.\n\nMuch of the reductions came because instructors would no longer be paid to teach these courses. The change seemed to trigger a faculty exodus from the program. Just 24 percent of first-year experience instructors in the fall semester were faculty, including department chairs, a huge drop from 80 percent the prior year. About 44 percent were academic advisers, support personnel who generally work individually with students to keep them on a path toward graduation. A quarter were other staff, and graduate students made up 7 percent. The total number of instructors fell from 131 to 105.\n\nThat would mean bigger classes across the board. So Georgia Southern added three lecture-sized classes \u2014 clocking in at up to 200 students \u2014 with undergraduates facilitating 25-person recitation sections for those courses. That kept the other sections down to around 40 students, still an increase from the prior year, but not as high as they would have been. Caplinger knew larger classes would be a harder environment than a small seminar to discuss sensitive issues.\n\nThe university provided data that showed that the ratio of faculty to staff in instruction has varied over the years, skewing more toward faculty following a university interpretation of a federal overtime rule. Still, the percentage of faculty instructors this fall was at its lowest point since at least 2013.\n\nThe university told faculty about the elimination of compensation between spring and summer semesters, Ludowise said, and that may have created some distrust. Faculty, she said, may have decided not to teach the course because they did not feel certain that volunteering to do so would be counted by their department or college for future promotions.\n\nThe first-year experience office offered training for these instructors. A four-hour general course in pedagogy training was required for staff who had never taught at Georgia Southern before, and all instructors were required to take a two-hour curriculum overview.\n\nTwo instructors told The Chronicle that one of the training sessions was a detailed overview of the learning-management system. Neither said they recalled required programming on how to teach diversity and other sensitive issues in these training sessions. Ludowise said instructors could have asked questions during the curriculum overview and said a teaching center offered optional training on topics including diversity.\n\nOne instructor, who requested that The Chronicle not publish their name or position for fear of professional repercussions, said colleagues without a background in teaching felt unprepared. The instructor said the university distributed the resources on the content uncomfortably close to the beginning of the semester, reducing time to prepare.\n\nThe main reason people were \u201cfreaking out\u201d was the diversity content, that person said: \u201cEverybody had the feeling that this is something serious, this is something we don\u2019t need to botch \u2026 If we are addressing this issue, we need to do it in the right way.\u201d\n\nAnother instructor interviewed by The Chronicle, Jolyon T. Hughes, said he felt the preparation offered by the university was sufficient. An expert on hate speech offered to pitch in on some of the teaching in Hughes\u2019s first-year seminar, taking pressure off. \u201cThat can be a weighty, tricky subject,\u201d said Hughes, an assistant dean in the College of Arts and Humanities and its communications officer. \u201cI was able to find someone I was extremely confident in.\u201d\nLudowise said that after the book burning, she heard from colleagues that the incident was the result of having staff teach. She disagrees, and said that all staff member instructors had a master\u2019s degree and some had a doctoral degree. \u201cI\u2019m not going to blame anything else besides the fact that we just need to learn, all learn, how to have these kinds of conversations with each other and come at a point of mutual respect.\u201d\n\nEven the common syllabus distributed to instructors raised questions. The university had picked Make Your Home Among Strangers by Crucet as a common read \u2014 it tackled issues that Ludowise thought all college students could connect with, no matter their race. Though students were required to read Crucet\u2019s book before her talk, a session on \u201cidentity and worldviews\u201d and two sessions on privilege were scheduled for after she came to campus, according to the master syllabus. That meant some students wouldn\u2019t hash out ideas in advance of the talk.\n\n\u201cIf you knew that there was a chance that there was going to be something explosive, then we would have made a different decision, clearly,\u201d Caplinger said in a recent interview, though he added that it would have been hard to have conversations about diversity too early in the semester, before students knew one another well.\n\nBefore the fall semester began, as the budget cut was enacted, the university removed Caplinger from the first-year experience directorship. The program was left without a leader. It remains so to this day.\n\nAt Crucet\u2019s lecture, a tense exchange turned up the heat. In one exchange, a woman asked the author why she \u201ccame here to tell all of these people that white people are privileged,\u201d according to footage reviewed by The Chronicle. Others in the crowd jeered.\n\nShortly after, a group gathered to burn her book outside. The book\u2019s spine wasn\u2019t catching, and a student shouted, \u201cThat\u2019s a hardcover,\u201d as a classmate crumpled up a page nearby. (Crucet did not respond to requests for comment through her publicist.)\n\nAs word spread of what happened, faculty members traded emails, obtained by The Chronicle under state open-records law. Even professors who were not connected to the first-year experience program expressed sadness and hurt. They said some kind of student outburst could have been anticipated because of the lack of investment in programming.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t make big words about diversity and inclusion and then throw a book at students, call a speaker, and hope it will all go down well,\u201d wrote Laura Valeri, an associate professor, in an email to her colleagues. \u201cI say this with respect for our students. It's just that you cannot expect 18-year-olds who have not been exposed to these kinds of concepts to read a book and suddenly be enlightened.\u201d (Valeri later told The Chronicle that she was feeling strong emotion after the book-burning when she sent that message, and that she had no involvement with the first-year experience program. She also stressed that she was speaking for herself, not the university.)\n\nImplicit in several professors\u2019 argument is a belief that good teaching, backed by sufficient resources, has the power to teach these nuanced themes effectively. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is on the advisers or even the FYE staff that was left in the wake of the defunding,\u201d wrote Jared Yates Sexton, another associate professor, in an email to colleagues. He declined to comment further. \n\nLudowise, the associate provost, disagreed, saying she believes \u201cthis could have happened whether or not we changed the class.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to start the process somewhere,\u201d she said. \u201cAs we challenge students, there will be disruptions, there will be people who react inappropriately, there will be people who exercise their rights in a way we don\u2019t condone and find personally offensive.\u201d\n\nKeyShawn Housey, a student-government association officer who had served on the first-year experience diversity outcomes committee, remembers how painful it felt to see an image of the book-burning on his phone. He saw it the next morning as he sat in the back seat of a friend\u2019s car, driving to class.\n\nIt was a slap in the face, seeing all the work he had done \u2014 from pushing legislation on diversity and inclusion to serving on the committee \u2014 violently disparaged.\n\n\u201cWhat is this Nazi Germany,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI don\u2019t even have the words right now.\u201d\n\nBut he does not believe that administrators could have foreseen what happened and the pain it caused. \u201cNobody could have thought,\u201d he said, \u201cwe were going all the way back to the 1930s.\u201d",

She said I already did something that will take it\u2019s place but my old college had nothing like that. Degree works says I need it too. Did any transfers skip it and it ended up fine?",

If you transferred in to GS before completing Area B at another USG school or from a non-USG school then you will have to take it.\n\nDegreeWorks is not to be trusted blindly; there can be courses in \"Fallthrough\" that need to be placed manually into the correct requirement spot in DegreeWorks. This is done by your advisor, who submits a form for approval by the appropriate college.  Be sure official transcripts from other school(s) you attended have been submitted to GS Office of Admissions and those courses are appearing in DegreeWorks.  \n\nTrust your advisor but ask questions. They are not awful just overworked.",

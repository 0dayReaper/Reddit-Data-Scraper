But I respect education and this doesn't do your school any justice. GSU students, like any students, have to stand up against this book burning and open dialogue for learning purposes.\n\nI understand, my White brother and sisters, you feel \"insulted\" when minorities talk about White Privilege. But understand this: \"White Privilege\" doesn't mean you can't be poor or exempt you from struggles. White Privilege means you are given the benefit of the doubt.\n\nIE: If a Black and White American are both poor, they face the same economic issues. However - the Black American will be more likely to be stopped and harassed by police which impacts their chances of getting out of poverty.\n\nIE: If an Asian or Muslim and White American are all poor, they face the same economic issues. However - a Asian or Muslim American will 100% of the time get questioned their loyalty to America and questioned for their English skills. A Chinese-American will be questioned for a Chinese Spy. A Muslim American will get stopped at airport because \"terrorist\". Will a White-American get stopped for being a Russian spy? No. White Americans will not. Thus leading to impact about job employment and struggles to pull out of poverty.\n\nThis is what White Privilege is. So next time - before your community (or if you are one of those people that burn the books) think you are being insulted. Think about some of the things minorities have to deal with that you don't.",

That's excellent. Better tons of people that get sub-par GPAs at City College.

Employers rarely ask for it and it is suggest you leave it off your resume if you have tons of experience (or at least a good amount). What I was referencing to earlier was entry-level positions. Students who just graduated from undergrad are expected to put their GPA on their resume. It helps their odds of getting the job. But I'm all ears; let me know how its possible to land a job without posting your GPA if you just graduated without work experience. You want to leave your resume blank? \n\nYou are older than I am. So maybe you haven't seen what the current state of graduate programs are like now. Its gotten much more competitive. Yes. Graduate programs care about exit GPA. They also care about your cumulative GPA too. And depending on what program you are trying to get into, they care about other specific factors as well. For medical school, pharma, or dental, they'll care about your \"science GPA\" as well. They care also about your progression as well (has your GPA been on up or down trend). All these factors to some level play a factor on your chances of being admitted. To say they only care about your exit GPA is ridiculous. \nNo one is disagreeing you with the \"tests\" (GRE, GMAT, MCAT, LSAT, and etc...) plays a big factor along with other activities too. Also social life experiences matter as well. We were just talking about GPA specifically. \n\nTo be fair - students don't talk about these things near or with their professors. Its not a great touch. Its done among themselves. During the medical school application process, you hear pre-med students discussing the acceptance rate and GPA of programs all the time. This continues onto the first year of medical school... Where you hear students, especially in competitive schools, asking what other medical schools others have applied to. The agenda of people asking for the acceptance rate of your school or where you applied to varies. But at the end - its still asked. As a professor, its hard for you to see what goes on in a student's circle. \n\nTo say no employers care or internship coordinators care is putting 100% generalized bias into the equation. Nothing is fixed. Nothing is 100%. Its all relative. Correct way to put it is: some employers care and some internship coordinators care. Again - referencing to my earlier paragraph - would an employer care if the student just graduated with no work experience? They probably would. \n\nI do thoroughly enjoyed talking to you.

The majority of students do not endorse their actions but when you are in the deep deep South shit like this is bound to happen, and fwiw those idiots probably won't even end up graduating, I mean think about it they went out of their way to buy the book (giving money to the author whom they don't support) just so they can burn it, not exactly this generations Einstein's and Hawkings.\n\nYou know nothing about our school or our culture, stop pretending like you do. Stop acting like an elitist douchebag and kindly fuck off. \n\nYou are acting as if the students and the school are welcoming that behavior and as I and everyone here has said we do not. However we will acknowledge their right to do it.

Its not competitive. It has a low graduation rate with a high acceptance rate. You can see why not a lot of people know about it. \n\nWhen that happens and you have students that book burn because they disagree with \"White Privilege\", it already smears the low appeal of your school even further. \n\nI never heard of GSU before till the book burning by the racist students in your community.

My room door is already locked. Actually I think my house door is already locked. \n2) While Yang is an attractive dude, I don't swing that way. Thanks for asking though. \n3) Oh man. Then Georgia residents are more stupid than I thought. I wonder how stupid you got to be to never heard of Stanford University and UC Berkeley. \n\nInteresting how you are skewing the facts. You are comparing out of state tuition to in state tuition. Of course - GSU would be cheaper if you are from Georgia. Two can play at that game. UC Davis would be cheaper for Californians. Why would Californians pay more to go out-of-state to a shittier school? \n\nBack to the point though - I understand money is an issue for a lot of people. You gotta be mad stupid if you are accepted into a great school but decided to not go. You are better off in debt at Harvard than debt free at GSU. \n\nSame weight/same ability to get a job? No. Dream on. If the undergraduate degree is all you are carrying, the school you attended will factor. Imagine this: if you and your competition for a job both have a 4.0, both have the same years of work experience, and both did great on the interview, who would get hired? The person that went to the better school. \nIf you are applying for an engineering job, would people at Google likely to hire a person with a CE/CS from degree from MIT, Cal Tech or GSU? I can tell you its not fucking GSU. \n\nSame ability to get into grad school? Yes/No. Yes in terms of the school you went to undergraduate doesn't factor into your application. But you wanna know the no part? You are less prepared for a competitive grad program. You honestly think GSU can prepare you better for grad school than say a more competitive/rigorous University? You are probably 10 times more likely more prepared and to graduate with a higher GPA if you went to a competitive undergrad program. \n\nIn your own words, \"so yeah - choke on that.\"",

You were comparing in-state tuition for GSU and UCD? I guess math is something they don't teach in Georgia. GSU In-state: $7,556 UCD In-state: $14,492\n\n&gt; one more thing one year at UCD would pay for all or almost all 4 at GSU \n\nExplain to me how does your one year at UCD pay for almost all 4 years at GSU.

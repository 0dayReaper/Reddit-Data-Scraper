    "postText": "I know it's a bit late in the semester for this (maybe this can be advice for me when summer starts) - I'm a transfer student and I haven't made any friends here yet. I'm really lonely. All the other girls seem to already have a friend group locked down and I'm not sure how to put myself out there in this town. I know literally no one, so I don't feel comfortable going drinking or something by myself.... Any advice? I'm commuter so all the dorm stuff doesn't apply, and I made all my friends at my last school though my dorm there... I just miss having people to be around",

Don't remember what the pages is called (I graduated in 2020).\n\nThere's really something out there for almost every interest. I am big into garden, and when I found out there was a garden club I signed up the next day.",

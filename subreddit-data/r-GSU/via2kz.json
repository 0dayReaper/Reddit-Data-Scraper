He showed me around the nursing building and everything was really nice and pretty much brand new. Far as I can tell it's a well respected program. He found a job very quickly, he's at a hospital in Marietta now.",

Still great. \n\nThe sown side is they are still growing and learning the demand. Be ready to do a lot of it on your own or with classmates. Some professors are useless at helping out, but that was when there were a few of them. Now they are getting a ton of professors. \n\nWhen it comes to studying, you have to figure that out. I have a great memory and don't have to study that much and do great. But do focus on your school work hard because the grading scale is different than the schools grading scale. \n\nAll in all, outside from long hours, you do have a social life. And I urge you to have a social life. Get away from school and take a breather. I also worked full-time while in school, and did great. And one of the few guys in the program.",

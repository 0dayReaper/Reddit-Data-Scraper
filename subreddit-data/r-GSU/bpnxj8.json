Park in employee parking. Attach fake plate to your plate to fool the LPR system.????\n\nProfit\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

I was trying to park in that lot close to hollis and saw the lady take my plate and call someone. five minutes that patrol car came by.",

I watched a video on the companies website of them operating, and they seem to drive fast enough that the driver can't really look at individual plates. I didn't think about someone ratting me out though. I'll have to park somewhere strategic to not be so noticeable.",

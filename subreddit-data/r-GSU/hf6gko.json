Ask for a list of alumni in your area and if they could help in any way. \n\nIf the first person doesn't seem to want to help go to the next person and/or professor(s). The program should be there to help with this kind of thing. Show that you have done your due diligence but lean on them for help. \n\nLast but not least. Be open to going back to the Boro area. If you are looking for small animal experience it may be hard to find anything anywhere. If they know someone in the Savannah area willing to take someone in - go back to campus.\n\nThey should be able to answer your second question too. \n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/vetschool/\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/veterinaryprofession/",

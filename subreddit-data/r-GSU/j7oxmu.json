    "postText": "TLDR: guy got pulled over for being a jerk again. \n\nI posted a week or so ago about someone driving a silver BMW and being a jerk. The other day they got right up behind a GSU worker in his work truck and kept revving his engine at him. The guy still back fires his car etc... \ntonight, I was helping the robots across the road. He was turning right on to chandler road. He back fired his car and scared me. His window was rolled down so I yelled at him and told him to learn how to drive a stick. He then rolled his windows up. \nTurns out, there was a cop right behind him with their windows rolled down. \nWell he got pulled over.",

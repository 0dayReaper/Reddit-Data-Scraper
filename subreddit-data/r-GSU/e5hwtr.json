Here's the link: [https://admissions.georgiasouthern.edu/programs/eagle-success/](https://admissions.georgiasouthern.edu/programs/eagle-success/)  \n\nAlso, I recommend emailing the office of admissions or the advising office for whatever program you're thinking about  to discuss affects/options as well.",

    "postText": "Hey gang, like the title says I'm an out-of-state grad student moving to Georgia this August to attend GSU's School Psychology Ed.S. My plans to tour the Statesboro campus/area and make informed decisions about housing have been totally derailed by Covid-19. Hopefully you kind redditors can help me out \ud83d\ude05\n\nDo graduate students typically apply for on-campus housing? I've noticed that sponsored off-campus apartments are the George, the Hudson, and One Eleven South. They seem really nice, though frankly I'm more interested in being frugal as possible than enjoying amenities. I guess being close to campus is important too! \n\nI'm pretty flexible and can handle a studio or roommates, whatever ends up working best. If anyone has suggestions I'm all ears! \ud83d\ude2d",

            "comment": "Honestly, with how inexpensive the city of Statesboro is, it's cheaper to live off campus than on. I rented a house my last two years and it was fantastic. Would highly recommend that option once you're in the area and established. Had many friends live at the George, and the commute really can't be beat. Welcome to Southern. I hope you love it the way I still do!   \n\n\n\\-Robin, class of '17",

            "comment": "From what I understand, they don't have graduate student on campus housing anymore. Most of on campus housing is for freshman and a little is left over for upper class men. \n\nStatesboro is so cheap to live in. Like so cheap. I'm going to miss it. My recommendation: don't live near the stadium. It's the highest density of the population around campus because of how many complexes there are in that spot. Which means it's the highest area in crime. Also, if you aren't too interested in our football team, football season can be pretty annoying on the weekends. \n\nDepending on how much money you have, some places are really nice. Hendley properties is great if you want to feel like your living more in a house type situation. They have multiple little groups of houses all around town. Beacon Place is a bit further than most of them, but it's super nice (but also very pricey compared to other places). I've lived at Lakeview for the past four years and liked it. I've had friends like the connection too. \n\nStay away from Market 100 and Southern Downs. They're cheap as dirt, but you get what you pay for from what I've heard. Also stay away from The Hamptons and Cottage Row. They are physically nice, but they tend to be the party areas from my experience. (I mean if you like to party then yes they would be good.)\n\nOverall, read reviews. On average, the reviews are pretty dependable. And talk to your cohort. Some people may have gotten their undergrad here and be able to tell you more.\n\nPS: El Riconcito, Chazitos, S\u00f6n's Donor Kebabs, and Three Tree are amazing restaurants. I will genuinely miss them.",

            "comment": "Have you spoken to anyone in your cohort? When my group was starting we were all moving from out of state so the girls got together to discuss our preferred living arrangements. Some were living with their SO and one wanted to live alone. I was the only one visiting so I found us a four bedroom apartment that wasn\u2019t very far from campus. We paid about $380 each but rent might have been raised. \n\nStatesboro is very open right now. If you are comfortable with traveling there are many offices for apartment complexes that are open. They can answer questions and maybe give you a tour if you wear a mask. \n\nIn my experience, I don\u2019t know any grad student who has done on-campus housing. Most undergrads move into apartments after their freshman year as well. Like I said, that\u2019s just my experience though!",

            "comment": "I'm a grad student myself and I've really liked living at Copper Beech. The stadium parking lot (where the campus shuttles pick up from\u2014paying for parking isn't worth it) is about a three-minute drive, if that. CB also has a shuttle that drops off by the Zaxby's. I'm in a 3 bed/3.5 bath/3 story townhouse for $465/month. CB also runs a lot of signing specials (I got a $500 voucher when I signed last April), so check their socials for those. The bedrooms and the house itself have so much space. I couldn't recommend Copper Beech enough, so if you want to know more about it feel free to ask! Welcome to Statesboro :)",

            "comment": "A little advice.\n\nWhen you see advertisements for 2br,3br,4br apartments at $450 or whatever, just know they are rented out PER ROOM. You'd have to pay $900 for the entire 2br apartment.\n\nIf you're forced to rent with roomates, just be advised that non-students also live in the off-campus apartments. I'd advise you to meet the roomates before signing the lease, and also tour the actual unit before signing the lease. I've found that many of the units in Statesboro do not live up to the Complex's model.\n\nSouthern Downs is a brisk 1-mile walk from campus, but you will hate your roomates or neighbors, I guarantee it.\n\nHonestly, I would stay away from any complex built before the year 2000. So eliminate the Garden District from your options. You have to travel over many, many speedbumps just to park your car and get back to your apartment.",

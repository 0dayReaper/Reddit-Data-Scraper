You just need to ensure your voter registration is changed to that location.\n\nPlease consider visiting r/ballotdropbox2020/ and leaving feedback about your voting experience.\n\n* Go to the Georgia thread\n* First words of your comment should be your region/location\n* Just give info on things like wait time/were there ruffians there/etc.\n\nWe're hoping this will become a good resource for people looking for a quick scouting report on early locations.\n\nLastly, aside from voting, the most important thing you can do is to spread the word among those that you know to form a voting plan. With COVID and everything else, ensuring people know all their options is crucial. I don't want people to turn around back home after seeing massive wait times and huge crowds on election day.",

The university I used to work for pre-GS switched all their single-stall bathrooms over to be gender neutral while I was there, and it totally gets rid of the frustration of having to really go while someone in your gender's bathroom is taking their sweet-ass time. \n\nInstead of gender I almost wish we'd have made a culture of use-specific designation for single-stall bathrooms. The fast lane is for piss, the slow lane is for shit.",

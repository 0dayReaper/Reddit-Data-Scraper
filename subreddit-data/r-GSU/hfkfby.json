And you're right, the virus does tend to hospitalize and kill younger people less than older people. The concern is that all these younger people now getting themselves sick are going to get their parents, grandparents, and other older people they come in contact with either personally or through work sick. And because the increase we've been seeing has only really happened in the last 7-9 days, there's not been enough time to see the full effect of that transition from younger to older.",

I know they exist. That was my point, when you saod that they didn't. I also understand how comprehend data, unlike you, apparently. \n\nBulloch County has a confirmed 147 cases, with 3 deaths. Thats about 2 percent, which sure, sounds lile not alot. But ignoring the fact that the death rate due to COVID is estimated to be higher than 2 percent by many estimations, and the US population is around 320 million people, thats 6 million deaths at a 2 percent rate. Idk why you seem to have absolutely 0 care about fellow human beings, and im sorry that you are sp seemingly sadistic, but If wearing a mask when I go shopping and not going to the movies for a few months can save lives? It's kind of a no brainer. You should really try not to contradict yourself before you have the audacity to call someone mentally handicapped.",

So the uptick in cases now is only indicative of a larger increase, because thats how pandemics work. Its exponential growth. Secondly I quoted the bulloch county numbers, so I don't really know what youre talking about, I gave you the local relevant numbers. Younger people are more likely to receive and transmit the virus at first, and less likely to die from it, but they will transmit it to those more likely to suffer from serious health issues, ie; the local elderly population. It takes time for this to affect the population, it isn't instant. \n\nThe people with the virus\nA: Exist \nB: are located in Statesboro, so thats where they are. \n\nAsking where they are is a stupid question if you admit that they exist. Theyre in their homes, quarantining, because thats what you're supposed to do. My apologies for misunderstanding your dumb ass premise. People are dying, the numbers are right there, of those that aren\u2019t dying, some are in serious pain. I dont get how you are just okay with that. \n\n\nAlso, its 'Moot' not 'Mute'",

Your mentality of not really giving a shit because there are no immediate consequences are exactly why we have lost so many more people than necessary in this country. Statesboro has a massive elderly population and let's just assume that this sudden uptick in cases is mostly people that have been going to the Blue Room, Gnats, etc... These are mostly young people contracting and transmitting covid, and a lot of them are most likely asymptomatic and won't need to go to the hospital. Now let's let that small group of people wander around Statesboro without masks because, \"Hurr-durr the media is stoopid and fear-mongering and if my president doesn't need a mask then I don't either.\" Now you have an exponential amount of people spreading this shit around, and guess what happens when we cross that threshold of our hospital capacity for patients? A literal FUCK TON of people start dying. This isn't something that you will see the immediate effects of. It will be gradual at first, and then sky rocket, ESPECIALLY if the virus makes its way to a nursing home or retirement community.   And all of this because of selfish assholes like you that don't want to \"be miserable\" again. You know what is actually miserable? Losing a fucking loved one to something that could have been prevented if people would have taken this more seriously. We have lost 124,000 people you selfish prick. Get your head out of your ass.",

To me the government could\u2019ve been more prepared for something to like this to help offset the economic hit, but that\u2019s a bigger question I don\u2019t have answers to. Either way, if we took this virus seriously from the beginning, maybe we\u2019d be where other countries are right now and opening up without risking unnecessary death. I have both my elderly grandmothers still with us and my grandfather currently in a memory care nursing home. I don\u2019t want to see them die unnecessarily. My mom beat breast cancer less than 3 years. Chemo takes a toll on your body and I don\u2019t want to see her die unnecessarily.

I know there\u2019s no easy solutions here, but to just live life normally as if there isn\u2019t an unknown virus running rampant in our society is not an option.

The case count was always speculated to be higher because of low testing, people were so adamant that it was way higher because we weren't testing enough...And now that we are, and cases are going up dramatically, but deaths and hospitalizations aren't, the virus is still...worse? And deadlier? Despite being *demonstrably* not? It's ridiculous. And you're just a hick that doesn't care about people getting sick if you point this out, apparently. These people will never be satisfied.",

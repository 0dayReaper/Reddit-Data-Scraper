    "postText": "Hi! Sorry to be that annoying potential grad student asking about campus, but I've looked through some old posts and haven't quite found what I was looking for information-wise. I'm trying to get a good gauge of the environment and culture of Statesboro to see if it might be a good-enough fit.\n\nFor background, I don't care much about football, I prefer not to party, I'm pretty progressive politically, and I have cared a lot about masks and taking social distancing seriously during COVID-19.  These things seem quite at odds with things I have seen and heard about GA Southern.  I didn't grow up in Atlanta, but I went to undergrad there, and students have a certain perception (or misperception, I don't know?) about GSU and its typical students.  I don't think I fit the profile of that stereotype at all.  With that being said, do you think I could find community with other students like me around campus, or do you think I will end up really unhappy because it is not such a great fit?  I visited campus about 1.5 months ago and was shaken by the amount of people not wearing masks (this seems to reflect a value misalignment for me), so I'm leery of culture shock in moving to GSU.\n\nAlso, I'm worried about the climate (temperature, humidity) in Statesboro.  I know it gets hot and humid for a lot of the year... for those who are familiar with Atlanta, how do they compare?  I'm originally from the north, so really humid and really hot weather for long periods of time is tough.  Though, Atlanta has been bearable, so if Statesboro is not much worse than ATL I can manage!  \n\nI also love spending time outdoors.  Statesboro seems relatively flat.  Are there good places to hike that aren't too far away?  Are there other typical outdoor activities people engage in throughout the year?\n\nThank you for any and all insight!  Again, I'm a prospective grad student, so I also don't know how separate or integrated the grad experience is with the undergrad experience, and if campus culture plays as much of a predominant role in student experiences at the grad level.",

            "comment": "Double Georgia Southern Alum here. I completed my grad program in biology around 2015. I guess I'll start with a more general statement about graduate student life: you'll be focused enough on your tasks at hand that things like \"campus culture\" will be very secondary to your experience. The culture that will be most relevant to you is that of your graduate cohort and the handful of specific professors you'd like to collaborate with.\n\nI 100% recommend GS graduate programs over \"larger more prestigious\" institutions for the following reasons:\n1. FAR less competition for your thesis advisors attention, they are often very willing to give lots of time and energy to your success\n2. Funding and departmental money is far easier to come by, again much less competition.\n3. Most (idk if all) departments will pay you to be there in the form of TA and RA positions. These are EXTREMELY rare and competitive at larger institutions (think UGA). They are very common at GS. I actually walked out of my grad program with money in the bank because cost of living in Statesboro is so low.\n\nI'm a biologist and did lots of field work, the area has some incredible and unique habitats to explore of you like hiking. Plenty of state parks and national wildlife refuges within a car ride. There's an entire group at the rec center that plans hiking/biking/kayaking/climbing trips, it's a very active campus. The weather? Meh, you get used to it, you figure out what kind of clothing you need.\n\nEDIT: I feel like I need to be a little frank as constructively as possible. If your criteria for picking a grad school includes \"will people agree with me politically, and is the weather ok?\" And not \"how will this institution allow me to pursue my research goals, how can I get my ideas funded, how can I turn my research into a career?\" Then, I would ask yourself why it is you're looking to do a graduate program in the first place. Not trying to be confrontational, just trying to get you to look before you leap. I've seen lots of very smart people without answers to these questions dive into grad programs and wind up wasting a ton of time and money with no end goal in mind beyond a diploma.",

I 100% agree with what /u/neonfern said in their comment about priorities for grad school, campus culture, etc., and I think GSU would be a good environment for graduate studies.\n\nAs for the politics -- yeah Bulloch County itself is pretty conservative, but the university is full of young people seeking higher education, and my social circle in undergrad was pretty liberal.  Most of the conservatives on campus are Greek life types, and if you weren't intending on socializing with those groups anyway, politics shouldn't be a concern.  I would say the undergraduate student body was a 50/50 split liberal and conservative, and graduate students are probably even more liberal.\n\nedit: as for people from Atlanta having stereotypes about GSU, I would chalk that up mostly to city people turning their nose up at rural areas. It is what it is, that'll be the same everywhere.  But the university itself doesn't feel like it's Hickville, USA or anything.",

I did a fair amount of undergrad research and I got to know a lot of the graduate students who were also in the labs. Everything you see listed above is 100% accurate. Even as an undergrad I was still given a ton of help and attention for some of my research from the Professors, and getting funding was also very easy. You will be closer with your cohort than anyone else on campus and will form natural and positive relationships through your shared goals and projects. \n\nDon't stress about politics to much, it's not like you will be condemned or confronted for your views at GS, especially in the graduate programs.",

I should clarify that I am very confident in the excellence of the program to which I have been admitted, and I am excited for the personal and professional growth opportunities it will afford.  My primary criteria for choosing a doctoral program has been first and foremost the rigor and richness of the program.  I have been admitted to several similarly prestigious programs, all of which provide solid learning and growth opportunities.  I have a good handle on the opportunities each will afford, which is why I'm not asking those questions at this moment to the general public.  \n\nThat being said, to differentiate and choose between programs, quality of life is a significant factor for me.  I will be spending the next 5-7 years wherever I choose, and I would like to engage with the natural world, form meaningful relationships, and get plugged into service in my community.  Quality of life is important to my overall health and mental wellbeing, which is why I am considering the culture, sense of place/belonging, and relational potential at my future home.  Questions about politics have deeper implications about how people view relationships with themselves and others, as well as social responsibility and value alignments.  Questions about weather impact one's ability to stay active and connected, and comfortable (not \"comfortable\" in the complacent sense, but more in the connectedness sense) in their world.  \n\nHopefully this explanation can shed some light as to why I ask these questions!   There are multiple factors to choosing a graduate school, many of which are easily answered during interviews, on the internet, or in talking with faculty.  Some things are harder to gauge, which is the reason I have asked for insight into these points!",

Graduate cohorts at GS are fairly cosmopolitan, we had folks from all around the country, very few from Georgia actually. I made some incredible and lasting friendships with people in my program and the graduate school in general. I didn't find faculty to be overtly political in any way, inside or outside the lecture hall.\n\nOverall, I'd say that Georgia Southern is a pretty big place and I'm fairly certain they have the kind of people you're looking for, especially within the grad program.",

GSU alum stick around and make the Boro their home for a reason. It's safe, not too big but not too small, just a classic small southern town.\n\nAs for masks, people do what's best for themselves here. My experience has been whether you do or do not wear one, people respect your choice. \n\nLiberals are definitely not the majority. I'm sure you could find like minded people though, I'm pretty sure there are some clubs/groups on campus. There is a GSU campus in nearby Savannah, which as a city has a bigger progressive scene compared to Statesboro. \n\nIf you're that worried from the beginning though you may not like it here. Your initial impression is probably correct and it just may not be the type of environment that makes you happy.",

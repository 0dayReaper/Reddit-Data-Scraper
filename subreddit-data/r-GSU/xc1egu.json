If you have undiagnosed ADHD, receiving a diagnosis can go a long way in providing relief when it comes to inattention symptoms by giving you a pathway towards receiving appropriate medication, accommodations, and/or therapeutic care.",

Normally these assessments are thousands of dollars, and I believe here they are only five or six hundred base rate here, minus insurance coverage.",

I said \"only\" to emphasize the first clause of that sentence.  That is, such assessments *typically cost thousands of dollars.*  Out of the context of my reply and out of the context of the sentence within which that clause is nestled, \"only\" may appear insensitive or out of touch.  However, it is not meant to minimize the financial hardship such a cost bears.  As I mentioned, insurance should cover much of that, depending on one's plan.",

If you attend on campus and have paid the health services fee (which you've likely done if you're enrolled in 4 credit hours or more) the Health Center is an option to get started.\n\nGood luck.",

They basically told me if I want to major in something other than the pitiful online-only selections they offer -- even with documentation from my physician explaining why I can't attend in-person classes -- I need to go to another school, which means paying application and transcript fees again, plus higher costs at the other school. They have the technology available to offer virtual classes to those of us with verified conditions. All it takes is a video camera and online testing options. They did it for 2 years. Now, tough cookies. Either you choose what they have decided to offer or you're out of luck.",

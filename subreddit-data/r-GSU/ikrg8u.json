They're still following the two week rule, so he's saying Greek Life began the spike because those students arrived early for Rush, the rest of the student body returning has continued the trend, and then the Director of Public Safety is quoted saying that the numbers will go down in a few weeks once we've settled in. At the end of the day, they're blaming all students, which makes sense politically. However, it still doesn't make it right. The local economy, his local economy, needs students in Statesboro to thrive.",

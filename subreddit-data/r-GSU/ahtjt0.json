                            "comment": "The USG has a very extensive history of screwing over Southern because we have the audacity to compete with their flagships (Georgia and Tech). We serve a pretty good sized market and if we were funded properly, we could be a regional powerhouse. This, however, does not align with the political and academic circle jerk of UGA and Tech that goes on in Atlanta, so we are very frequently subjected to ridiculous impairments from the USG to try and keep us \u201cin our place\u201d. This happens in the form of a long list of funding cuts throughout our history, or more recently, the extremely unrealistic, and frankly stupid, merger with ASU. I\u2019m convinced the USG knew full and well that it would negatively impact Southern (which I think we can all agree it has, but my heart also goes out to the ASU faithful that lost their school), and also save a few bucks in the process. It was a win-win for them. This also will explain why so many people were up in arms when it was announced that a USG staff member would become our interim president. The USG just won\u2019t allow us to prosper like we can because they are scared we\u2019ll make the glorious bulldog school up north look bad. ",

A group of Savannah-based folks in higher-up positions in the state, who hold a lot of social capital, wanted a large university to have a presence in the city. They saw it as something lacking, and saw the impact that both Tech and Ga. State have on Atlanta, and figured they could make Savannah have the same thing. The only problem was, you know, Savannah's lack of a major university. Savannah State is a HBCU (the oldest HBCU in the state), so messing with them is bad PR. SCAD is a private pyramid scheme. So the easiest thing to do was to to take ASU -- a school without much grandiose history, that has mostly been a commuter school, and most importantly, was going through money problems -- and \"merge\" them with GSU. \n\nThe entire purpose of the merger was to get Georgia Southern into Savannah, not really to punish anyone. \n\nI'm not trying to say that the merger wasn't odd and boneheaded, but the intention behind it was actually to give Georgia Southern more power in a larger city, not to \"keep us in our place.\" ",

This is probably the biggest reason why I get upset at fellow Eagles who support other schools in State. Who cares who you were raised to be a fan of. Actual alumni for those universities who are in power have and will continue to attempt to hamper the growth of Georgia Southern. It's not just about 'sports'. Advertising is huge, why give them free advertising and nothing to your own school? ",

Both of those states FULLY invested in their public universities and have several Top 300 National Universities. With that in-state power-houses have lost political and footprint power; mostly sports. I think they probably look at what UCF is doing and say we don't want any of that shit here. \n\nTo sum it up. They know we have a huge potential and are scared. They have it pretty good so why screw it up? ",

The USG was upset about some things he refused to rubber stamp as part of consolidation, and he got branded, within the USG, as not a team player. \n\nHe was asked to leave by the USG as the consolidation came to a close, with the understanding that if he didn't leave on his own, the USG would refuse to renew his contract, which is a huge black mark on a university president, often making it hard to get a job elsewhere once your contract expires.

I'll respond to your points.\n\n&gt;University System of Georgia does not like us very much\n\nThe USG likes us fine.  They do like the R1 schools more, though.  R1 = UGA, Ga Tech, Ga State, Augusta, because they are purpousfully supposed to do more research and have bigger budgets and reach more students.  Ga Southern is at the next tier of schools designed to do some research and educate the area they are located in.  This is why we consolidated with Armstrong.  To reduce the duplication of effort on educating Savannah.\n\n\n &gt;and doesn't give us a lot of  money, \n\nFunding is based on a formula that takes into account enrollment and level of University.  When it comes to new buildings, GS has been better funded over the last 6 years than all other schools except for UGA.\n\n\n&gt;so the presidents leave for a better paying job\n\nKeel's whole goal for returning to Georgia was to be president of Augusta.  GS was always a stepping stone for him.  \n\nHebert got caught in the politics of the consolidation (which he didn't know was coming when he took the job) and got tired of it all.  He got a raw deal.\n",

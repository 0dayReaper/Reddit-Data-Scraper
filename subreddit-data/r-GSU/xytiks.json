You\u2019d think by paying 6 million dollars for new internet you would make sure it at least works before people that pay for it show up and use it.",

I'm not even sure why they changed the wifi bc I was able to game on my ps4 in the dorms in 2018 and people are saying they can't now.\n\nBut georgia southern does have a formal complaint system (you can find the form by googling formal complaint ga southern) and they have to be reviewed and addressed, so if you haven't filled it out yet I would. And get everyone else you know living in the dorms to do it too",

It\u2019s a special network to allow the correct ports for more appropriate NAT types and packet priorities for a better gaming experience. \n\nIf you are living on campus you can go to mygameconsole.georgiasouthern.edu and fill out the form. You will need to provide some proof of ownership via screen shot and the MAC address and it will be manually approved from the form by an IT staff member or they will contact you if they have any other questions or concerns. \n\nAdditionally, if you are experiencing issues on the WiFi after getting this added go to the front office of your residence hall and ask for an Ethernet cable assuming your room has an Ethernet jack in them. Some halls do, others don\u2019t.",

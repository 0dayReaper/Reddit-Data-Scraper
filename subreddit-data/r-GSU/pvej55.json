I don\u2019t wanna join a frat that\u2019s extremely trashy and wanna know which I should try to avoid. Sigma chi seems nice if I were to get a bid I but idk much about frats at southern and can\u2019t seem to find a lot of information",

Actually spend some time and ask questions about the things that are important to you/them: academic requirements, social activities,  philanthropy, intramurals, chapter conferences, finances, etc. It's about finding the best fit for you as a young man, developing into a true man, leader, etc. Just because you know a bunch of guys are going to one house or another, doesn't necessarily mean they'd be the right fit for you. You'd hate to pledge a house and then realize later on that you made a mistake with them and wasted both your time and money. That's just my opinion tho.",

They may treat the brothers better or I may have caught them on a bad night. go through rush with an open mind so you can find the frat that\u2019s right for you.",

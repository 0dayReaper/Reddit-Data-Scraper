I graduated in November 2020 and had a great time at GSU.\n\n-Try to hit Chick-fil-A during non-peak times, aka when class let's out.\n\n-I recommend looking at the club web page and find like minded people to do activities with. The garden club was really fun for me.\n\n-Take advantage of the indoor hottub at the RAC. I miss that thing so much!\n\n-Dont waist your electives on dumb classes like \"walking\". There's plenty of fun electives, for example I took horseback riding and archery.\n\n-Splash in the Boro is amazing!!! Please go see it this summer at least once!\n\n-There's lots of on-campus jobs if you're interested in working while taking classes\n\n-Living off campus is much cheaper\n\n-When you get homesick listen to \"Statesboro Blues\" by Blind Willie McTell\n\n-Embrace the suck of hard classes. Never surrender.\n-Take trips to go see historic Savanah \n\n-Go see the beach at Hilton head or Tybee Island \n\n-Stop and smell the flowers while walking around campus some time \n\n-One day you're going to miss college, I'm telling you! Try and enjoy the little moments!\n\nJust to name a few. If you have any specific questions, I'm here for you!",

(I already have a roommate in mind so it doesn\u2019t matter too much) it would just be something I didn\u2019t know before hand. I will definitely look into the clubs, but what is RAC? Also are what are meal plans like? Is it only GSU specific places or does it include other things? I\u2019m assuming I can get a student discount places??? Sorry for all the questions I just don\u2019t have anyone to talk to about this lol",

I've had some that were great, and others from hell. You'll smell a lot of weed around the dorms.\n\n-RAC = Recreation Activity Center. Imagine a huge gym, indoor &amp; outdoor pools, basketball courts, rock climbing, sauna, etc. You'll have your freshman orientation there.\n\n-Freshman are required to be on a meal plan. Unlimited food and visits at the Lakeside diner and Landrum cafeterias. I thought the food was good, but it does get a little old after a while.\n\n-Also another big tip is to buy a Brita water filter pitcher. Statesboro water is GROSS AF, and in my 6 years of living there I could never get used to drinking that water straight from the tap.",

Frequent buses and the walk is not bad either as long as you don\u2019t have back to back classes on opposite ends of campus. A car to get to class really isn\u2019t needed your first year since you already are required to live on campus. A car becomes useful for groceries and eating out. The buses even go to some off campus housing. I got a bike my sophomore year and rode it to campus because the bus didn\u2019t stop near me. Roads are decent.\n\nAll dorms have either a full community kitchen and community laundry room or in your room. You will have a place to cook and do laundry. You will need to bring your own laundry and cooking supplies though.\n\nYou will smell weed. That\u2019s a college thing, not a GSU thing. Improvise, adapt, overcome.\n\n(I graduated in 2018 but pretty sure the above is all still true. Think they have electric scooters on campus now? I\u2019ll let a current student confirm.)",

Freedoms Landing has a washer and dryer in every room, but in most dorms you'll have a communal laundry room.",

You do get a good amount of swipes (enough to go 3 times a day for every meal if you want). The food isn\u2019t bad but it\u2019s extremely repetitive. It will also make you sick at least a couple of times. After about a month you\u2019ll learn what to avoid. It\u2019s different for everyone, but for me it was the salad bar. Every time I got a salad, I got stomach cramps and bad poops later on.  The dining hall is set up like a giant cafeteria with multiplier different stations like salad bar, sandwiches, burritos, pizza, burger and fries, etc. there are also a couple different places on campus that take dining dollars (chick-fil-a, Starbucks, Gus mart) that you can get food from.\n\nThe dorms can be complete chaos at times but are also super fun and an essential part of college. They\u2019ll help build character. Each dorm has a different vibe. I lived in Eagle Village and loved it. The RA\u2019s I had there were very chill and easygoing so we got away with a lot. I don\u2019t know too much about the other dorms but I do know to avoid  Kennedy and Watson. They are set up traditional dorm style, which means you share a room with someone and have communal bathrooms. The rest of the dorms have private bedrooms and you just share a bathroom, living room and kitchen area with your roommate. The RA\u2019s are strictest in Centennial Place dorms. Other commenters were right when they said you will constantly be smelling weed. It\u2019s not to bad in individual rooms but can be rank in the hallways depending on the habits of your neighbors. \n\nIt\u2019s going to be hard to avoid tough core classes. Most of the work isn\u2019t hard at all, it\u2019s the professors who make or break a course. Rate My Professor will be your best friend. Use it and believe it. People don\u2019t lie. If they say a professor is shitty, that professor is shitty and will make your life hell.",

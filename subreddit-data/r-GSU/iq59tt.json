    "postText": "Over the past couple weeks, I\u2019ve been attempting to voice my concerns over the  USG\u2019s and Ga Southern\u2019s in-person guidelines during this semester. Well after doing a lot of digging and questions to SGA senators, I\u2019ve found that student government is currently not a thing. Apparently, they are overhauling the system government this semester. \n\nSo in case if anyone was wondering, submitting any kind of feedback to SGA this semester is about as effective as punching a brick wall.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve been doing more digging and calling more admin numbers to ask questions and I\u2019m getting sent to many different voicemails. I\u2019ll let y\u2019all know if I find anything out.",

The USG has really taken a shit where it eats and I think that it\u2019s gonna come back to haunt them. \n\nAnd isn\u2019t there something in the student handbook about accountability and ethics? Why isn\u2019t the administration being held to the same standards?",

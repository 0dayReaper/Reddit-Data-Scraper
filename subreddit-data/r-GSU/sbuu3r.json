    "postText": "I'm a returning student and taking everything online. Some professors seem to really understand Folio and the course is laid out in a standard way with assignments and reading under each week and due dates show up nicely in the Folio calendar. Other professors seem to think they should be creative with this and put random stuff in random places and not put the due date in Folio so that you have to hunt through their syllabus unless they put it in a separate schedule or unless they put it somewhere else. Then for no reason, they just don't put a due date on a discussion. One prof argued this with me and had some dumb reason but it is because the \"due\" date is not the same as the \"close\" date and they could have accomplished the same idea. Sometimes the due date is just embedded textually in a random place. So you're stuck making up your own calendar of due dates for all of your courses...except some profs don't put everything in there at the beginning...so you're stuck mindlessly polling all of the courses and folders making sure there is no embedded hidden assignment that is due tonight! It baffles me that despite a diverse group of organizations courses on Coursera are set up in a more consistent and standard way. \n\nDoes anyone else find that infuriating??",

We're never told any official way to use Folio -- all we're really told is that at a bare minimum, we have to have a course shell turned on to activate the mandatory attendance verification quiz for the first week, but after that it's our choice of how much we even want to use Folio. \n\nThere's no standard, so like a lot of things on life, you just have to keep your head on a swivel.",

My students have said they primarily use the internal Folio calendar, so I've been leaning more on that than anything.\n\nEDIT* One more point I wanna make real quick: \n\n&gt;I'm guessing that is a core difference with Coursera along with utilization metrics driving poor courses off the platform. \n\nCoursera and Folio are kinda apples-and-oranges. Coursera is for pre-built distance-learning courses. We call them MOOCs in education -- Massive Open Online Course. It's designed for students who will be learning everything ENTIRELY online, and the designers of the courses go into the creation of the course knowing that. \n\nFolio is a re-branded version of a product called D2L Brightspace (Essentially, GSU paid D2L for the rights to license and re-name the software on our campus and add in a bunch of our own layers). D2LB is what's known as a LMS, or Learning Management System. They're primarily designed to compliment in-person courses. Although a lot of professors put a lot of stuff on them, and although we can use Folio to build ground-up distance learning courses, a LMS like D2L Brightspace is designed to be as open-ended and have as many uses as it can, because it's going to have a bazillion different use-cases. An in-person physics lab may only need it to post instructions and the gradebook, whereas an upper-level humanities class may use it for posting dialectic discussion responses. \n\nA LMS has to be a jack-of-all-trades software, whereas a MOOC can be built with streamlined intention. \n\nDoes that make sense?",

I understand this is less possible for topic or events courses, but for most it is possible. Anecdotally, online students are older, have FT jobs, are more likely to work ahead, and are definitely more likely to \"plan\" ahead out of necessity so putting week 1 out on Tuesday night with it due at 10a Sunday is not ideal (for instance). The biggest thing is exactly what you said though... Due dates on everything so they show up in the Folio calendar. If nothing else that's the most important thing. Most of my complaint is hidden assignments in random folders that don't show up in the Folio calendar...\n\n# MOOC vs LMS and Templates are good\n\nI'm aware of the difference between LMS and MOOCs (I have taught online courses, designed course material, and used some of these in roles of buyer, instructor, and student..). However, it is possible for an LMS to be prescriptive or have templates. Very few of the courses I have taken at GSU justified any differentiation at all. Very few have any live lectures (required time management on my part but I enjoyed those the most). It really could just be set up exactly like Coursera but with grades. Granted my experience is only as an online student. The idea of me (M43) sitting in a room with a bunch of 19-year-olds or people who think there is a debate about vaccines is thoroughly unappealing. In any case, I believe the software could address that with templates.\n\n# GSU as a (M)OOC\n\nAlso to be clear -- about half the courses I've taken at GSU have been really the same quality or level (some cases lower quality) as Coursera and there was really very little difference over the MOOC approach. In fact, the mostly automated courses at GSU that use MGHConnect are much much lower quality and I learned nearly nothing in them except how to pass a course efficiently. Since the course catalog does not warn me or tell me of alternatives I get \"surprise\" courses that are frankly mostly a waste of time. Additionally, if you take the \"master\" class version (paid for) of a \"specialization\" (series/track of courses) at Coursera it is more hands-on than the average GSU course. I actually considered finishing my degree that way but it is (largely through a school in Texas) significantly more expensive at the moment.\n\n# Real time grades - I like\n\nBonus round: some instructors have set it up so you can see your grade go up and know when you're kinda \"done.\" Due to my terrible academic results in my youth, I tend to be a bit \"extra\" on a lot of assignments...so somewhere by the last few weeks it is often \"gee you could fail every homework assignment and still pull an A\" --this is a nice to have thing though I realize it encourages me to slack off in the last few weeks :)",

            "comment": "I feel your pain.\n\nAbout 5 years ago I had a similar issue. I only take two classes online because I work fulltime now, but I had a situation where Folio said Date A, syllabus said Date B, and the assignment itself closed (just as you described) on Date C. The professor says the date I used was incorrect and marked me down from an A to a C, which dropped my overall grade for the class down a full letter grade to a B. I took issue with this and emailed saying that if the grade wasn't restored, and screenshotted proof of the differing dates, I would file an official complaint with the registrar and dean of students to have my official grade changed or a note listed on my transcript as I was accepting it under protest. I have no idea if any of these things are possible, fyi, but adjunct professors are there for an easy paycheck, not tenure. My grade ended up getting changed.\n\n\nBack I fully feel your pain, it's stupid. Since then, I get a calendar and hang on my wall by my desk and write every assignment due for the semester on it that's listed in the syllabus in black sharpie, and then compare it to the due dates in folio and list any differing dates. It's so stupid that we have to do that, even now after being online an entire semester with Covid, but here we are.\n\nGood luck!",

Not doing it now is just foolish. It's not like there isn't enough room, just the school being cheap/lazy.",

So if you need to get from that side of campus you have to wait for the bus to go to the stadium Then stop at chem circle it isn't convenient.",

And save everyone a couple minutes..\n\nAlso by the time you spent to walk to the stop and wait for a bus you could easily be halfway across campus on foot. The busses are supposed to make getting across campus easier. And few have it harder than Biology students that have to get from the BSB to the Nat sciences building in 15 or fewer minutes.\n\nMy point is if the forest drive building and the engineering building each gets a stop even though they are 200 feet apart why can't the new building and bio sci get one?\n\nIt would even help some art students as the ceramics building would be easier to get to as well",

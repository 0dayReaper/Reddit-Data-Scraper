Running down the middle never works, we let runs go for no reason. It\u2019s just soooo frustrating. I LOVE our team and I love the energy Chad gives our community band the team but I can\u2019t be the only one frustrated with the outcome of some games and watching them. Maybe someone could change my mind since I\u2019m not the most well versed in everything football but From what I\u2019ve watched it\u2019s frustrating",

It hasn\u2019t done us much all season and it seems kinda stupid when the teams we play are all throwing deep or at least running more than we are/do. I\u2019m watching the bowl game right now and have been so mad at how poorly this has gone",

Its what we do here. From Erk Russell, Paul Johnson (ran triple option at Georgia Tech), Jeff Monken (currently running the triple option at army) and now coach lunsford. All of the coaches who have been hired here run the option. We went 10-3 last year. Relax",

I'm not the only one frustrated by it either, plenty of people are. I also asked someone to explain it better to me to see if I could understand the point of running a triple option over other types of offense. I love watching our school's sports and care about it a lot, I just want to understand more, you telling me to relax does nothing lol.",

Ill say it again, we are an option school. All of our players are recruited to run the option, all of our coaches have been brought up coaching the option and thats the scheme they know how to coach the best. Thats why they are hired here. Obviously you go to southern and know how big GSU/Statesboro is on \u201cTradition\u201d . So simple answer for you, The option/running the ball is what our players are recruited specifically for. Our lineman aren\u2019t huge SEC lineman that can just stand back and pass block all day. Our coaches recruit Smaller o-lineman that are more athletic and suited better for pulling and run blocking. The receivers we recruit are not  the 5 star players  that the big schools get with 100+ catch,  1000 yard seasons. We recruit guys that are physical and good blockers down field since we run the ball so much. They\u2019re not the fastest or the best route runners in the world. They have the ability to catch but thats not what they\u2019re here for they\u2019re here to block. So trying to turn all of our players that are recruited specifically to run the ball into a pass happy offense wont work.",

I never really thought of that so that makes more sense. Like I said I\u2019m not well versed in the specifics of football and details like that. I just really like to watch so the explanation helps so thank you honestly",

So I could buy him a ticket and he could stand in student section despite not being a student?\n\nAlso how would entrance work? Would he come with me through student section entrance?\n\nOr will he have to buy a normal ticket since hes not a student?",

That Lanier gate was always a disaster for traffic and getting people in and out. We were always concerned about people getting hit and then not being able to get into the game. This new gate allows FAR more people in at once reducing time spent in line.",

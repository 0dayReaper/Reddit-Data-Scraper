I\u2019ve had some fully tell me wrong things where I have to call the main campus offices and get an actual answer. But I think that just comes with having different campuses anyways. Everyone I know likes living on armstrong and it is small so it\u2019s super convenient. across the street from target, big lots, McDonald\u2019s, etc lol so that\u2019s a plus",

            "comment": "Also depends on the department you\u2019re going into. If it\u2019s a smaller department(think physics or math), I\u2019d look at which one has the bigger department. Also if you wanted to do research I\u2019d look at your departmental faculty to see if any of their research interests you. And I guess the big question: would you rather live in Statesboro, a real college town, or Savannah, a city where your college happens to be. They each have pros and cons - I went to the Statesboro campus and am now getting a master\u2019s at a school that is in a larger city, so I\u2019ve seen both firsthand.",

    "postText": "Has anyone else heard anything regarding on housing for transfers/returning students? I haven\u2019t heard anything since April 1st. \n\nIn case housing isn\u2019t provided for me, has anyone lived in the George? I was thinking maybe the George but wasn\u2019t sure which housing plan to select and the price is slowing going up. Also, I was thinking of paying the app fee ahead of time, but wasn\u2019t sure if paying it means that I\u2019m 100% committed to housing at the George in case if I actually do get on campus housing?",

It\u2019s also super close to campus and some of the cheapest rent in statesboro\n\nAlso if I\u2019m not mistaken, all on campus housing is going towards incoming freshmen. Returning students are shit outta luck and get nothing. You will have to get off campus housing.",

Also, do you know if paying the app fee means that you\u2019re 100% committed to the George? Aka if I pay the app fee could I just say no to the apartment housing in case if I do receive on campus housing? Thank you!",

Those are the ONLY differences. Size, layout and room space is all the same. \n\nIt\u2019s been so long since I applied so I\u2019m not sure. I wouldn\u2019t think that would make you committed. I recommend going in and talking to them or calling them. The front desk people are super helpful and are always able to answer my questions or get me in touch with someone who can.",

Me and my gf use the same closet for both of our clothes and the other one for storage. It\u2019s a lot of closet space",

They\u2019d drop cigarettes off of their balcony and they\u2019d burn through my hammocks. The man living there even spat at me one time. It sounds dramatic but it was pretty awful. Plus when we moved in in August, whoever was there before smoked in the apartment and everything smelled like cigarette smoke. I moved out a few weeks ago and everything I own STILL smells like smoke. I didn\u2019t like it, I\u2019d recommend a better place tbh.",

They closed campus/classes Tuesday and Wednesday to prepare but then said the campus was projected to be open by Thursday...is anyone else making sense of this? I left for the long weekend and I don't want to return just before Statesboro POTENTIALLY gets hit.\n\nArmstrong campus has had mandatory evacuation and they're close enough to us. What does everyone think about the plans for the rest of the week?",

On Friday, this storm will have moved more in 5 minutes than it has in 2 days.\n\nIf you want to criticize the University over premature cancellations, talk about Irma instead. But that was more so because of the Georgia governor panicking and ordering mandatory evacuations of people east of 95 five days before the storm was storm was projected to come, even though Hurricanes don\u2019t get really locked into their path until about 48 hours out.",

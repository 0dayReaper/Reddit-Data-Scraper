It later became the Hangout (which got more popular after Midtown closed down), but there were always so many fights and Eagle Alerts coming from that area, guess they decided to close shop. I highly doubt GATA's has made a return, but if I had to guess, the new place will probably resemble it. (For reference I graduated in 2019 and the Hangout was still there when I left).",

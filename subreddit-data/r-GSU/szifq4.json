Time management was an issue the last time around so I'm hoping to ramp my way up by starting with one, two classes at first.   \nIt wasn't very clear if you could based on the Admissions site.",

Eventually I tried three but ended up dropping back to two because I worked a fulltime job. Since returning, you're exactly right that it's all about time management. But I have a 3.72 GPA since returning and I graduate in either Fall of this year or Spring of next depending on how Summer goes.\n\nStick with it!!",

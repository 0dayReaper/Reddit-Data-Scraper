They agreed that it was considered a seizure, so the question was whether it was considered \u201creasonable\u201d. The argument that the intrusion is slight and that the good outweighs the bad is, to me, an insufficient reason to circumvent our rights.",

My concern is the erosion of our rights in the name of security (or any other reason, really). \n\nI respect the police, though I believe they have in many respects forgotten their place and have accrued entirely too much power (civil asset forfeiture or the militarization of police are good examples). That, however, is a different conversation altogether.",

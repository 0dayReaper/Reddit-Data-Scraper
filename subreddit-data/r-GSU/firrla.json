If you're going to put out a story on a current issue (about which people are currently anxious), you absolutely need to make sure it's actually real.\n\nThey asked six parties for verification:\n\n-Georgia Department of Health was unavailable\n\n-Bulloch County Health Department was unavailable\n\n-Spokes person for the CDC said they couldn't verify a facebook post\n\n-Secretary Cody Hall did not immediately reply to an email\n\n-Mayor McCollar did not immediately respond when they reached out to him\n\n-The church itself was unavailable\n\nGiven all this, it is horribly irresponsible to publish this right now.",

They had information from what the church posted, and they made it clear that was all the information they had at the time. And they were transparent in the fact they were unable to confirm the info beyond what the church posted by listing all the other agencies they tried to contact. It would be irresponsible to only repeat what the church said, but they made it clear that attempts have been made to validate the information, and they will update the story when they have something.\n\nDuring a situation like this, that's about the most responsible form of journalism you could ask for.",

I've only met great people at the tracks. If you wanna try my 1/5, just let me know. I'm in Augusta ATM, but I travel to Savannah and pass through Statesboro occasionally.",

I also go to Phil Hurd Raceway in Savannah GA. It's private, so I'm a member to get access to it. It's also 1/8 scale and smaller. I don't believe there's any tracks in Statesboro.",

It was given to me by one of my dad's friends a few years ago, but I've never really toyed with it since it had a bit of a learning curve and I think parts and fuel for it were pricey.\n\nIt has a McLaren F1 GTR shell, it's a nitro Traxxas car from 2005.",

Or if I can't solve the issue I post for help in facebook groups related to 1/5 scale. The fuel is 25:1 usually, gas:2 stroke oil. Replacement parts can be expensive, depends on the part that breaks. \n\nI know they do make F1 1/5 scale cars. Just many people don't go that route. I think my model 1/5 came out in 2008. IF you wanted to get it running again, I may be able to help. :)",

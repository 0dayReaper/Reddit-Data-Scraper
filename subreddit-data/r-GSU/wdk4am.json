            "comment": "You can request a change to your schedule using the Schedule Change Request form (link is in the email you received from your advisor after SOAR). However they don't normally make changes based on professor preference for a number of reasons: 1) an alternative is rarely available, especially this close to start of term and 2) for the most part, ratemyprofessor is a terrible source of information. They never delete reviews, so you might be looking at info that's years old, and students tend to only leave reviews when they're angry so you're getting a very biased picture. Also, those students likely learn in a very different way than you do and thus experience faculty different from how you will. I would recommend attending the first day of class to experience the prof yourself and see their syllabus, and if you still think it's a bad fit, you'll be able to make changes on your own at that point (freshman no longer have to use the request form once the term starts).",

            "comment": "Out of all the classes I've taken, there has only been one professor that was really just bad at teaching. His notes/examples were completely opposite and different of what he asked for on the tests. But the class material was also difficult for me to understand, but I got a C. \n\nTime management is what drags most people down. They either don't go to class, don't take proper notes when needed, don't do homework, blah blah blah. Go to class, do your homework, get good sleep, dedicate the time needed to succeed.\n\nMost professors, really all professors, will give you a syllabus that will outline what you'll be doing, the dates for the assignments, and what they require to achieve the grade you desire.\n\nManage. Your. Time. and there's almost no reason for you not to do well. Wait until Spring to party, use the first semester to establish your study habits to succeed. Many kids go home at Xmas break and never return.",

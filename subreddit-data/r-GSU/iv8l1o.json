    "postText": "As somebody who has been spending a lot of time trying to find remote work, I know how tough it can be these days. It's tough to find good job boards (there must be 1000s by now) and there are too many long job board list blog posts that nobody wants to read.\n\nI decided to build a simple directory of the Best Remote Job Boards broken into categories (General, Development, Writing, Marketing, Sales, Freelance etc...), Tools and subreddits to help make it easier for people find remote work who are just starting out. There's even a section for Remote Jobs and Internships for Students \ud83c\udf93\n\nThis site is a work in progress and any feedback would be greatly appreciated. If you know of any good job boards or additional resources, please share them below and I'll add them.\n\nPlease check out the site and let me know what you think \ud83d\udc49 [https://remoteindex.io/](https://remoteindex.io/)\n\nThanks so much!",

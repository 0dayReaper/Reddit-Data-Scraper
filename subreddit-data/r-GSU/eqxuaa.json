Her most notable professional  experiences are as a correspondent on the Russian government funded propaganda channel RT America, and in the Venezuelan government funded propaganda Telesur media group. She has also pushed the conspiracy theory that the US government orchestrated 9/11. Definitely not someone I want associated with our school.",

That has very much been a Republican thing, either in states like Georgia as we see here, [or by executive order from Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/us/politics/trump-antisemitism-executive-order.html).",

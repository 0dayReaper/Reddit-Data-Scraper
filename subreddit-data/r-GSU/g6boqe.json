Does anyone have any suggestions on getting into this class? They are taking forever to process my documents, so I won\u2019t be able to register for a few weeks.",

There's a dropdown menu that gives you the option (assuming that there's actually a waitlist), but only if it lets you add the course. I'm already registered for 12 credit hours, so I would have to drop one of my courses just to see if your course has a waitlist lol. Hope that makes sense.\n\nIf there isn't, you would have to check periodically to see if there's a section or seat opened up and then add.\n\nI'm guessing you're taking it at GSU because GT's version is harder and more expensive? That's a smart move, actually.",

Theres a chance they could add another summer class, so be on the lookout. Also, try to contact your advisor and see if they can notify you when a spot or class opens up.",

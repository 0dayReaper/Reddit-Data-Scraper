The bus route works well enough for weekdays (it can be kinda busy and crowded though) but weekends you will have to walk or bike it. It\u2019s not super busy for traffic usually. There\u2019s a couple crosswalks but not much if you walk through campus towards the RAC to the Chem building",

Like if you wanted to walk to the library or dining commons from Freedoms I\u2019d say it probably takes 20-30 minutes just to get to the destination and that\u2019s if you\u2019re walking a decent speed and not being held up at the crosswalks. I might\u2019ve gotten the times wrong. Anyway you also definitely don\u2019t wanna walk all the time cause whenever it rains that walk will be absolutely hell just because of how the ground is on an incline pretty much the whole way with tons of dips for puddles to form. So unless you have rain boots your shoes will get soaked all the way through.",

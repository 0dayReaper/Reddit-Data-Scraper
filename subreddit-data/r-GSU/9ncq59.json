It allows for better in-class exercises and activities when I know people are there. \n\n&gt;If a student can not show up and still pass why shouldn't they?  \n\nI mean, they still can if they really want to. My policy is to take one point off your overall final grade for every unexcused absence. You can totally still pass the class if you miss, say eight days. It's just that you may be dropping from a 91 to an 83 and losing that A letter grade. \n\n&gt;They're the ones paying you after all.\n\nNope. They pay the university for access to classes. The university pays me to teach the class. Students are not my customers, I'm not beholden to them. That's not to say I don't listen to their concerns or take my evaluations seriously in terms of ways to improve, but the mindset of \"I'm a paying customer and therefore ...\" with students is silly. \n\n&gt;it's also your job to evaluate if they know the course material. \n\nOne way to better ensure they know the course material is to incentivise presence while I'm teaching it, before the assessment.   \n\n&gt;I'm sure you can tell I have a strong opinion in this, \n\nMost undergrads do. Heck, I probably did back when I was in undergrad. It's not until way later that you actually see the value in it. ",

However, I've never had a professor not give at least one free absence. \n\nIf I ever end up teaching, I don't plan on having any attendance policy unless the university makes me. Lecture and 3 tests, that's it. If you can never show up and pass the tests you deserve it. I don't necessarily plan on teaching, but I haven't decided I wouldn't do it. ",

I teach a subject I think is super important to society as a whole, so I want my students to be there for what I have to teach them. One of the most direct ways of doing that is by having a points-based attendance policy. \n\nThere are other reasons -- like it making in-class exercises and activities easier, but that's the big reason. This stuff matters, so you have to be in class. \n\n&gt;And I have to say that attendance policy is terrible. \n\nSorry you feel that way. \n\n&gt;I've never had a professor not give at least one free absence. \n\n\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

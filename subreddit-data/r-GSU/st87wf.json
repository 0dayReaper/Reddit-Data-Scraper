Does anyone know any easy 2 credit hour classes (ideally something like a gym class) that doesn't really have any homework or tests available over the summer?",

For example a history class or if you have a foreign language requirement, it's fast paced and easier to keep up with than the 15 week courses.   Your degree is worthless if you didn't broaden yourself. Economics is more fun in the summer if that's still on the to do list.",

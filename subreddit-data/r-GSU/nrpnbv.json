    "postText": " I'm going to be a new grad student in the fall, moving from Asheville, NC to GSU. My master's program is going to be in higher education. If I'm being honest, I am terrified to be in a new environment not knowing a single person. I'm hoping y'all can send me some positive vibes and tell me that GSU/Statesboro is an awesome place and that everything will be okay. It's just stressful looking for places to live and preparing for grad school.",

            "comment": "I'm currently living in Asheville, and I went to undergrad at Georgia Southern! \n\nI LOVED living in Statesboro. I had an amazing time. I'm also kind of familiar with the higher ed program since a lot of their students were Graduate Resident Directors, and I was an RA for 3 years!\n\nStatesboro is the definition of a college town in all the best ways. You will quickly form a community there (especially if you get involved in University Housing in anyway - it's like a built in friend group haha). It's super easy to get involved in things and meet people. It's extremely walkable. The campus is beautiful. The facilities are great- go to the RAC! The group fit classes are the best! \n\nIt's also only an hour away from Savannah and the beach! Take advantage of that! Tybee is awesome.\n\nLiterally, don't worry. Statesboro is a great place to be. It's been 2 years since I graduated, and I still miss it! \n\nIf you want some advice on where to live or just to talk more about things, feel free to message me!",

The campus is beautiful, there\u2019s lots of good resources for any problems you might have and the people really just mind their own business. I\u2019ve known a few grad students and they all seem to stick together, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll make friends!!! Sending you positive vibes friend :))",

There is a great gym, rock climbing wall, pool I believe? \n\nThe students all were really friendly when I was there and I definitely second saving up and splurging on a trip to Savannah every once in a while. Tybee Island has a great free beach if the weather is nice.",

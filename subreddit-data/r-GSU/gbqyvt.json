I have already completed one year of Engineering courses (mainly core courses like Physics 1 and 2). Is there any online resource to get a course plan of an academic year at REPP?",

As for as what courses you will have to study just search for your majors curriculum sheet (in this case @ Georgia southern). You should see some overlap of year 1-2 matching the REPP requirements and if done perfectly you will attend GSU (year 3) matching the curriculum sheet. Hope this helped",

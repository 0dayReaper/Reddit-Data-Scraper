    "postText": "So this is going to sound a little dumb, but I have arachnophobia and I currently live at The George. I've had to deal with giant spiders (Raid doesn't work), which is extremely stressful for me, so I'm looking for different places to move to that would solve this. What apartment complexes do/do not have spiders? I know it's Georgia, so there are bound to be a few run ins, but I'm hoping to minimize that, if possible. I would really appreciate any help with this.",

I like the idea of The George, but I\u2019ve had several issues with them, so I\u2019ll go apartment hunting this weekend. \n\nThe complex does \u201cpest control,\u201d but not nearly often enough and I\u2019ve been spraying periodically. I just haven\u2019t seen any improvement. \n\nAny good, fairly priced furnished places?",

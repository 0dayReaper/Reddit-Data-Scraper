At bigger schools there\u2019s lotteries to even get a chance to buy or reserve a ticket. Go to a few football games and other sports and it\u2019s already paid for itself, especially if you look at see what the outside ticket cost is.\n\nRAC fee: while all other pools are full of drunk people, you got two nice ones plus a sauna. Free yoga, zumba, aerobics classes all hours of the day and night. Nice gym equipment, not to mention the nice walking trails. All you need is your ID or scan your eyes.\n\nTech fee: like not having to pay to print? Thank this fee right here. The amount of pages you\u2019re able to print out a semester for free is insane. Don\u2019t think I ever went under 1000 my whole time there.\n\nSustainability fee: recycling bins everywhere, having water stations that you don\u2019t need to press a button for and can keep moving, etc.\n\nActivity fee: similar to the athletic fee. Go to a couple events during a big week (finals, welcome, homecoming especially) you\u2019ll definitely see where the money is going. \n\nStaying in your dorm is great way to really get mad at all the fees, but if you at least go an be semi active on campus, it\u2019ll lessen the blow.",

You can swim and take fitness classes for free. There are plenty of intramurals that are dirt cheap. On top of that, the RAC fields and amenities are top notch. If you use any/all of those things regularly, it likely works out to a better deal than anything you\u2019ll spend on books or a meal plan.",

    "postText": "Yep. I had a question for my advisor about graduation because I'm studying abroad right now. My advisor sent me back a reply answering it but also telling me he'd made an error in my advisement LAST SUMMER. It was an issue with class credits counting differently because I'm getting a BA instead of a BS.\n\nLong story short, I'll be here another semester and all my plans are totally fucked. I'm doing study abroad because I plan on teaching English abroad for 2 years after graduation with my Fiancee. This was suppose to start next fall, because I can't get a work visa with a teaching organization without a degree. My Fiancee and I have lived together for over half a year now (she's studying abroad too for the same reason) and things were going great. She'll be starting the teaching before me now and we'll be separated.\n\nI'm both extremely pissed off and lost on what to do here. I'd rather not move back to Statesboro to take 1 class and there's no online class list for the fall yet.",

My most recent advisor has actually been very helpful. But if I had listened to my 3rd advisor I would probably be graduating a year late, he was making me take wrong classes, not informing me of what I should be doing. Then he left and I got a new advisor and she put me back on track to graduate on time. ",

            "comment": "Never trust your advisor. It's a hard lesson to learn, but at the end of the day it is your responsibility to track the progress on your degree. I know that sounds harsh, and they are paid to advise you, and they should know how to do their job but you should always double check (triple check). My advisor gave me bad advice, advice I knew was wrong because I had looked up the requirements for each part of my degree and minor. I pointed it out to them, and they said they would make the correction then never did. Instead, I went to the head of the department (for my second discipline) and asked which courses I needed to complete the requirements. From that point forward I showed up to advisement with my form filled out and just pointed them to the signature line. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I had listened to my advisor, the same exact scenario would have played out for me. My advice to you is to talk to the dean or head of your program. Perhaps you can get an override, or a special study in place of the final class that you need. Don't be rude, but stand firm that this was their mistake. Take any correspondence you had with the advisor as evidence. Maybe they can work something out for you. (As a side note, it was like 3 years after graduation before I stopped having a recurring nightmare about finding out I had missed one class and my degree was now void. This was literally my nightmare scenario for a few years.)",

Your best bet to request help or ask technology related questions is to either call the Service Desk, or place a MyTechHelp support ticket. Either way, you should get help/answers to your question. This can be requesting software on a lab machine on campus, a wireless problem, unable to login to your my.georgiasouthern account, etc..   \nYou can also visit the 1st Floor of the Statesboro IT building for assistance, TechHub at Armstrong's Student Union or the Liberty campus TechHub for walkup support.  \n  \nWhen making a call/creating a ticket, please do provide as much information about the issue as possible. If you're in specific area, include the building/room number too.  This includes residence halls if you're having Cable TV or Internet issues.  \n  \nCommunication about the solution/troubleshooting is normally done through the ticket.  Updates to your ticket are sent to your email address, and you can reply to the email in order to communicate with the team member assisting you.",

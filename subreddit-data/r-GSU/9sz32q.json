Should books like to kill a mockingbird be censored? Should Huckleberry Finn be censored to remove Nigger Jim? Absolutely not. Especially considering both authors stance on racism.",

It's that when confronted by a students misplaced anger she failed at explaining the context of the quote and why it's important to be able to say it academically.  Instead she insisted that she can say nigger and said it out of context in a rant about her free speech. The problem is also that this is the only issue from the protest getting press. The full letter of grievances has some problematic issues that I would have raised my eyebrows when I was a student ten years ago. ",

What would happen if you just left your job in protest? Hmm?\n\nEdit: I don't care if you downvote me. College is not supposed to be a safe space. If you get triggered by something someone else says, that's on you.",

And you're blatantly attacking protesting which is just unamerican. You're allowed to disagree with what they're protesting but don't try to say they don't have the right to, or that they should be punished for it.",

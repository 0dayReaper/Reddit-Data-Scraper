I left the carruth building and as i was walking out the door i thought \"man, i really have to pee, i should be able to make it to the IT building though.\" As I walked it got worse and worse. It hit me out of nowhere. I began to feel like I couldn't make it and thought about making an emergency stop at the Carroll building, but decided to power through and potty dance and walk slowly with my legs close together the rest of the way to the IT building. Barley made it!!!",

    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI'm sure nearly all of you are using Pearson MyLab for at least one class. My Spanish 2001 class has MySpanishLab integrated within Folio, and it's been an absolute nightmare for my class to register for it.\n\nWe don't have a course ID since it's linked with Folio, and a lot of us in the class purchased 2 year access previously for the entire Spanish sequence. Since you technically need a course ID to use the access you purchased previously, we're basically being forced to repurchase access for this new course. Thankfully, my prof is working with my class to make sure this doesn't happen.\n\nI was just curious if anyone else is going through this BS. I'm hoping it'll get solved before my two weeks free trial ends.",

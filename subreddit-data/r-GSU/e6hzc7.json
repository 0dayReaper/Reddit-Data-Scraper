The armstrong campus used to operate like a university before the merger. Now it operates like a community college. We have to literally take classes that are taught by Statesboro professors via webcam that used to work here.",

Considering how much expansion Southern is performing and planning currently, I could see why resources would be stretched insanely thin.\n\nIt sucks that Armstrong is getting shafted, but I think the ire is misdirected. No prof in Statesboro wants to teach via video conference. No one in Statesboro wants Armstrong kids to have a subpar experience. This is Southern doing their best to pursue their own goals and interests while maintaining service to another school after being saddled with a financial liability by the board of regents. I wish the merger had never happened, for the sake of both schools, but here we are.\n\nThe funny thing is, I bet if Armstrong fielded a notable football team, it never would've happened. Not saying they should've, or that it's right, but it did save UAB, somehow.",

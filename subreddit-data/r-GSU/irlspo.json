Yet Georgia Southern University doesn't,\u201d said Rob Yarbrough, a professor of geography at Georgia Southern, who drafted the faculty letter. \u201cIt\u2019s not they can\u2019t.\u00a0They just don\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe rate of confirmed and self-reported positive tests at Georgia Southern last week declined nearly 30% from the prior week, said Jennifer Wise, a\u00a0university spokeswoman. The college has\u00a0upped its testing capacity for those with\u00a0symptoms and is working\u00a0with the county to provide asymptomatic testing, she said.\n\nCounty officials assure the university, she said, that \"positive cases reported at Georgia Southern are not impacting availability of care in the area.\"\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kt4tw034gsm51.png?width=716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=88f942a1941616d66199793303d40b0dfb079c42",

Hand multiple roommates that I had to threaten reporting to the office so they would stop smoking in the apartment because I couldn\u2019t even sleep in my own room without getting headaches. They just thought no one could notice. \n\nAnd even if you don\u2019t room with anyone, you really shouldn\u2019t smoke in the apartments. Do it outside.",

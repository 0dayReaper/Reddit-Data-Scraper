    "postText": "Hello, I was recently offered a student assistant position starting in the Fall 2019 semester. One of the key things I know you're not allowed to do is hold another on-campus job position if you already have one(can't work two on campus jobs). However my start date is 8/11 due to it being in the fall, and i will still be in Statesboro during the summer for both terms. My main question is although I have accepted the job offer, am I technically employed by the department? My answer to that question is no because my start date isn't until August, but I want to be somewhat cautious.\n\nI'm wondering cause I am looking at other on-campus positions for the summer, and I did not want to mess up my employment or create a conflict of issue in the fall due to the no 2 jobs rule. If anyone has any experience or advice with this it would be greatly appreciated.",

I had one job in one department of the library and almost got another job within the resource department of the library (didn\u2019t get it due to hours).  \n\nIn your case though, you could email them to be sure, but if you will not be on their payroll until fall it should be okay because you aren\u2019t working there yet, you\u2019re just expected to in the fall. As long as your summer job ends before your fall one starts I don\u2019t see the issue with having both.",

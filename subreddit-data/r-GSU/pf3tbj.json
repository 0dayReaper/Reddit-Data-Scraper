Before the university even considered copying spring 2020, we'd go back to socially distanced classrooms, put clear barriers back up, move back to a hybrid model, even mandate masks, before even considering going 100% online. Without saying as much, both the president and provost have said that going 100% online is essentially a non-starter unless there's like, mass deaths.",

They've determined that's about when the effectiveness starts dipping low enough for it to be a concern. I got my second shot in April, so I've got mine penciled in for December.\n\nI have also been told that the university is going to try to offer the booster using the same sign-up and distribution system they used in the spring for first-round vaccinations. That worked easy-peasy back then. Except for the fact I had to sit my Gator-grad ass in the waiting area and watch the replay of that fuckin' football game they were showing on a projector for the mandatory 20-minute monitoring period.",

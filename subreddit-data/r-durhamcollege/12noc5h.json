I was curious and spoke with admissions directly and they gave me the following information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 2023 intake: \n728 applicants;\n24 seats;\n98% minimum grade for admission acceptance \n\nSeptember 2023 intake:\n673 applicants;\n48 seats;\n94% minimum grade for admission acceptance\n\nPost-secondary courses are weighted at 1.15 times higher than high school courses. So if you had 80% in a pre-health course, then that course would be bumped up to 92%. No difference if the course is college or university, they are weighted the same.",

    "postText": "I applied to Durham college and others (Fleming, Seneca, Georgian)  and received an offer from everywhere but Durham College so far. I heard they don't send out offers for Janurary until Oct 1st. I'm trying to plan ahead so I accepted the offer from Fleming although the 45 min commute/moving isn't ideal. I really would like to go to Durham College as it is close and I just finished pre health there. I have nothing to do right now so I wanted to get started taking some electives for the nursing program at Durham, to make the semesters more manageable for me. but I don't know if I should wait and see if I receive an offer? My grades are good but I'm not sure. Or should I just stick with Fleming? Thanks!",

I took one of my courses in the summer to lighten my load in a regular semester, but that was 10 years ago.\n\nThe only thing is, I don't think you will get a break on tuition for a course you've already completed. You'll still have to pay in full.",

I did pre health at GBC and sent my transcripts over to the other places June 1st. \n\nHow long did it take for you to receive an offer from Seneca after you applied ? \n\nMy Durham account says it\u2019s all \u201cMet\u201d just waiting for a decision now",

            "comment": "So I am also going to Durham in September for Dental Hygiene. I can't speak on the Dental Hygiene program but I did take Dental Assisting which is quite similar. Just a heads up, it is a lot. You will have 8 ish courses in a semester which means you will have 8 \"exams\". Many courses such as radiography, clinic and dental materials all have a theory class AND a lab class where you preform what you have learned in theory. I have advanced standing so I got out of radiography because I took it in dental assisting. As long as you stay organized with a planner, stay a week ahead when all possible, and ask questions you will do very well :)",

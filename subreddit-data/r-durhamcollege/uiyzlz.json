I am looking to connect with other students starting Dental Hygiene this fall!!!\n\nI am pretty well versed in the Dental community and can help answer any questions you may have :)\n\nIf you guys are interested in starting a snapchat group chat lemme know and I will put one together. My Dental Assisting class had one and it came in clutch. We can all get to know each other and ask questions and kinda help everyone stay on top of deadlines :)\n\nComment or pm me your snapchat if you wanna be added!!",

(Medical clearance/cpr/modules.) if you don\u2019t get an email from verified, call Durham college. Don\u2019t wait until the last min to do forms. You have to book an appointment date with verified ($50) for them to review your forms. Once all your forms get approved, you are all set to do school :)",

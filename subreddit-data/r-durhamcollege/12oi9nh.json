    "postText": "Hi, I was just wondering if someone can tell me how the bridge program works for finance - business students. I'm in my first year in finance - business and I plan on taking the bridge program to Ontario Tech. For the requirements needed to bridge, is it true that I have to have a 75% in each of my classes or do I need a 75% average in each of my semesters? \n\nAlso, I have 3.0 gpa and was wondering if that is good enough to get into Ontario Tech bridge program?",

You also gotta remember that it changes every year so next year the average could be higher. I\u2019d suggest you meet with Ontario Tech and discuss your options, they\u2019re pretty helpful.",

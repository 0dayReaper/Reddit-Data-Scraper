They could be off right now on the break or could be incredibly busy with the change in semesters. Give them some time, the nursing program is incredibly hectic and I\u2019m sure their dealing with loads of emails regarding the upcoming intake. If you can try and call the department if your able to find the contact, may need to call the campus and ask to be directed to the nursing department. It may be worth your wile to contact them through Microsoft teams (you can use their email for this).",

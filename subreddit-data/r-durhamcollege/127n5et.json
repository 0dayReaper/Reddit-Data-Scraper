    "postText": "Hello everyone\n\nI have accepted the offer for September 2023 dental hygiene program from Durham college. I want to start completing my prerequisites for the clinical placements that are due as of first day of my class. I currently live in Toronto.\n\n1. I have a question regarding the immunization record. I don't have taken my necessary vaccine doses in childhood but I don't have the immunization record from my home country. What is the best possible way to get the immunization record form filled up?\n\n2. I am not registered yet with any physicians clinic. Will a physician in walk in clinic do the needful? I have Canada life insurance from my spouse employer, will that help cover the charges?\n\n3. Where can I get my CPR certificate from? Which agency is considered acceptable?\n\nPlease help me with my queries if anyone has already gone through the same process. \n\nThank you",

            "comment": "1. If you don't have the immunization record you can try going through a Dr and getting a requisition for bloodwork that can show immunity for some vaccines, most likely you'll just need to get immunized again \n\n2. If you haven't applied for OHIP already, get on it now. No one can answer your canadaife insurance question as thats entirely related to the policy, so give them a call. And yes find a walk in clinic that should do the trick \n\n3. Any nationally recognized program e.g. St. Johns ambulance or red cross\n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "Hi I am a pn student at Durham College and I can answer some questions here.\n\n1. I was in the same situation. There is a clinic in school. If you did immunization in the past, they do the blood work for you and if you still have immunity u will get exempt for those for some vaccines. Plus some of them, if certain years passed u still need to be immunized so best to visit the school clinic. They do the tb test and all the blood work and get your form done. I remember it was cheaper to do it there than the physician's office i go to. I remember I only got TB test and tdap vaccine done after my blood work. Rest were still positive. \n\n2. I am not sure about your status in Canada so i can't really answer question2. If you have eligible status in Ontario to get OHIP, get one.\n\n3. Search redcross website. I live in Toronto as well. I found one location in dt so i did it there. It is valid for a year not really necessary to do it so early.",

            "comment": "dental hygiene program at DC is 3 years o.o it is advanced diploma. Im on the website, couldnt see the part it takes 2 years to complete xD  \nEdit: oooooh so i saw the website it said their delivered model is 3-1-3 meaning students go through the semester 1, 2, 3 then have a \"summer break\" then do another semester 4, 5, and 6. So it goes faster and can complete within 2 years time frame but still consist of the 6 semesters in total. In tradition like GBC, it would be 1st year with semester 1 and 2 then summer break, then semester 3 and 4, then summer break then semester 5 and 6. So that spread out to a total of 3 years. I hope this help lol",

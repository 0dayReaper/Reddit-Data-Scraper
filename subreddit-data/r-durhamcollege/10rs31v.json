    "postText": "Hey!\n\nI was just accepted to the practical nursing program. I was just wondering if anyone can answer a couple questions for me. \n\n1. What is the delivery like? Based on the website, I got the impression it is Friday nights and 12 hours on Saturday and Sunday. But I saw someone else say it\u2019s not that long. Can anyone in the program confirm what your schedule is like?\n\n2. How are your placements? What kinds of units are you working in and what are you able to do? Where have your placements been? I know Lakeridge but has it been all Oshawa and Whitby Lakeridge? And have you stayed at the same hospital throughout different semesters or do you get moved around?\n\n3. I heard you need to purchase scrubs. Can I purchase from anywhere as long as they are hunter green?\n\nSorry for all the questions! I just want to know that this is a good program and I know what I\u2019m getting myself in to before accepting. \n\nThanks in advance!\ud83d\ude0a",

            "comment": "I'm assuming you are In the Flex program...\n\n1. Lecture delivery hours can vary and hours are not set in stone, but you can generally expect:\nFRI - 6pm-9pm\nSAT/SUN - 8am-5pm\n\nClinicals are 1 day per week, 12 hours on Sundays, usually 6:30am-6:30pm (it can vary depending on your clinical instructor)\n\n2. Starting in 2nd semester you have clinicals: \n\nSemester 2:\nA. LTC (6 weeks) \nB. Mat/Child clinicals (1 or 2 clinicals but that may have changed since pandemic restrictions are over and could very well be 6 weeks now)\n\nSites for LTC will be LH Oshawa/Ajax/Whitby or Bowmanville. The type of unit is not specific but will mainly have geriatric patients. I was at LH Ajax for both LTC and Mat/Child\n\nThis is your first clinical so you have a bunch of checklists and skills that need to be signed off by your CI before you really get to do things alone: manual BP, HR &amp; RR before getting to use the machine and other stuff I can't remember. Once you pass those things the CI will let you do what your co-assign nurse requests you to do.\n\nSemester 3:\nA. Mental Health (6 weeks)\nB. Community Nursing (6 weeks)\n\nMy cohort did both virtually, but I have heard it's now in person.\n\nSemester 4 - Med/Surg clinicals at any LH site for 12 weeks. The units are varied but expect to see a wide variety of patients. I was at Oshawa.\n\nYou flourish more at this clinical. You get assigned 1 patient and gradually work your way up to 4. There are skill check offs like PO/ IM/Subcut/IV med administration, sterile dressing changes etc...you learn a ton during this rotation\n\nThere is no guarantee you'll be at the same LH hospital throughout the program. Expect to get moved around.\n\nSemester 5 - Consolidation can be anywhere. I was at a Toronto hospital on an acute medicine unit. \n\n3. Yep, you'll need to purchase scrubs from anywhere so long as they are hunter green. I heard the DC Bookstore carries them and you can find them in many other stores and on Amazon as well.\n\nHope this helps answer your questions! \ud83d\ude42",

            "comment": "Welcome! I\u2019m currently a 2nd semester flex student. \n1. As another commenter said, it can vary a little. Last semester, I had class Friday 6pm- 9pm , Saturday &amp; Sunday 8am-3am (with breaks). This semester is Friday 6pm-9pm, Saturday 10am-6pm and Sunday clinical. Usually there are two timetables to pick from. Clinical says will change each semester, either Saturday or Sunday. \n\n2. I\u2019m currently doing my Mat/Child clinical first. We only go 1 Sunday out of the 7 weeks. The rest of the time we are doing assignments/other school work at home. I have Older Adult after midterms, which is 6/7 weeks. They\u2019re doing the placement in the hospital right now, either Oshawa or Ajax. As far as we\u2019ve been told, nothing has been decided as of yet on if we will do our mental health and community clinics in person or virtual. It will depend on the COVID situation closer to next semester. \n\n3. Yes, as long as they are hunter green. Shoes for labs/clinical must be brown, black or white with NO mesh and have a closed heel. Do not wear the crocs with the holes. That might seem obvious but it happens. \n\nAlso make sure you prioritize Anatomy and Physiology study time. It\u2019s a very hard class, so prepare well each week and utilize the online SALS tutoring (you\u2019ll learn more about this). You have to pass this class to move on to second semester and unfortunately, it has a high fail rate. Not trying to scare you but I don\u2019t think a lot of students were prepared for how hard it would be.",

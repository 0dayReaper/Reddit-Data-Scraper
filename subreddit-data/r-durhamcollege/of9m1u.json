The only thing you need in this program is you should know basic python and little bit of ML Algorithms. First semester you will have to code more but the second semester is easy you have more theory based courses. You will have a course in second semester where they will help you to make Resume and stuff according to Canadian Standards (which is good if you are international student just like me).",

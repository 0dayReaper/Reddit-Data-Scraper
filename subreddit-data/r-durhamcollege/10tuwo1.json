    "postText": "I applied for the dental hygiene program for the fall 2023 but sadly did not get accepted. I however got accepted into the pre- health science program PHSC and PHSO(hybrid) both are not the advanced ones. Which would help me get better grades for the next intakes. Just wondering for anyone currently in the program or planning on doing it. Is it a hard program? Is there any advantage in taking the non-hybrid one compared to the hybrid one as I know there is a weighing factor when applying for DH program?Thanks",

I got rejected 3 years straight before getting a final offer last Sept. I took my prehealth 100% online. The only difference between the 2 programs is the hybrid is online and you go in for labs. And the other has in person lectures. I would go for the hybrid as I prefer online classes for that. It\u2019s up to you, both will get you an offer for hygiene. Just keep your average around 90% because with the 10% grade boost you will have a 100% to admissions. The applicant averages get higher every year.\n\nAlso keep in mind that it\u2019s much harder to get into a May start as there are only 25 seats compared to the 45 in September. For my September intake it was a 97% acceptance rate with 800 applicants.",

I had really good grades because I was able to do the content at my own pace rather than worry about classes and I was able to save more money because I had extra time to work. I think either of these would suffice for you, the only difference is that the online version is run asynchronously. :)",

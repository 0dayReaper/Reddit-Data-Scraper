    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m an international student at durham college and I\u2019ve requested for a deferral from my January 2022 semester because I\u2019m facing a study permit delay. But the international applications team has refused my deferral request and withdrawn me from the January 2022 session. So where are the tuition fees I\u2019ve paid for that semester?\n\nAnd also they\u2019ve accepted me for September 2022 session and it\u2019s showing on MyCampus that I\u2019ll have to pay my fees again. I\u2019m very confused on what\u2019s going on here.\nCan anyone help me out here please?",

Have your timeline ready and prepared with all relevant information. They have to work with you to clear things up.",

    "postText": "Ill be starting the dental hygiene program this fall. I was told to get a tool box but the school never specified the dimensions. If you are a current or former dental hygiene student at Durham, could you kindly let me know what size of tool box you have? I want to make sure it fits the locker and all the dental stuff I will need to put in there. Thank you so much!! \u263a\ufe0f",

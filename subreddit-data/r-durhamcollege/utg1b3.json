    "postText": "Hi i'm not sure if this is the correct community i should be posting this in but I pose a really important questions to ask \n\nIs the new degree program at Durham the \"the artificial intelligence\" honours degree worth it, as i know that the traditional way to enter artificial intelligence is by a computer science degree by a uni. I was wondering if this degree would be looked down upon in the eyes of employers? Would it look bad compared to a computer science degree? Is the program worth it has anyone attended it, what's it like how are the professors? everything or any advice would be greatly appreciated thank you",

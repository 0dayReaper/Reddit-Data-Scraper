The website doesn't state much but I work a full-time job and doing the course work is something I can manage, I know its not recommended.

Flex is design for people who is working full time \\~ courses is manageable with having a job, have a friend who is in the normal RPN still have a full time job aside  \nim in the normal RPN too pm me if have anymore questions",

My main concern is the grading component. I love doing big assignments or essays, but I can\u2019t handle tests. Especially the memorizing. I mean, I did do much better in Anatomy at UOIT. I prefer courses like those over bio and chem, but I\u2019m still scared I will fail. And isn\u2019t there math in Nursing as well? I\u2019m super freaking out about that, I suck at math, so I don\u2019t know what to expect. Are the teachers nice by chance? Like is there anyone that makes learning difficult? Ultimately it does matter on who your prof is, and their teaching style, so I\u2019m so so nervous. And I\u2019m so sorry for the long paragraph. It\u2019s just that, I feel so behind in life and I don\u2019t want to repeat past mistakes, I was a student at UOIT and an upgrading student at DC, but I dropped out, (I liked DC but I hated the presentations and math in upgrading, it was frustrating to say the least, and one of the Comm teachers made no sense to me).",

Most of the profs at DC are nice and helpful, and easy to reach out when you are struggling or need help. Yes there is a math in nursing, its at 2nd semester that require 80% to pass. So far i find everything in DC good for nursing and as for tests, anatomy is the one that you need to memorize the most and probably medical terminology course, other courses is more situation based type question, for example, what do you need to do as a nurse if this patient have a risk of falling, something like that \\~ hope this help",

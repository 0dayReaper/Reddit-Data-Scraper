    "postText": "Hello, I m have recently applied to the May 2023 intake for dental hygiene at Durham college. My high school gpa is a 96 in the four main courses and a 3.4 college gpa. Has anyone else applied yet? Or is already in the program? What should I expect, in terms of my chance of being accepted?",

I also took dental assisting so I had advanced standing in the program and get exempted from radiography. It\u2019s quite hard to get into. My friend I took prehealth with had a 3.6 gpa and got waitlisted. I am not sure how admission works. The best advice I have is to apply to multiple colleges. Admission is always so iffy.",

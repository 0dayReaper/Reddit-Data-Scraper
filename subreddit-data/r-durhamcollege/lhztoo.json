    "postText": "Hello guys,\n\nThe waitlist for DH program was released last week. The cut-off grade for it is 94%. Only 48 seats available but there are more than 100 applicants on the waitlist. My question is has anyone who was waitlisted but received an offer for the program already? Thank you and good luck to the ones who haven't. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\n\nUpdated on Mar 2: After a whole month waiting, I got accepted into the program from the waitlist! Best of luck to you all! \u263a\ufe0f",

The U-PASS doesn't work on TTC.\n\nHere's more info on connecting to other transit: [https://www.durhamregiontransit.com/en/routes-and-schedules/connecting-transit.aspx#TTC](https://www.durhamregiontransit.com/en/routes-and-schedules/connecting-transit.aspx#TTC)\n\nEdit: It's important to note that you are eligible for a reduced co-fare if you are transferring between DRT to GO Transit. See the above link.",

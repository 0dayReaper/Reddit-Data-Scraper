When I initially enrolled I was thinking I'd be working fulltime during the weekday and study for a postgrad cert during the weekend.\n\nNow i've received news from my employer that I might be let go soon, I'm considering on doing a second program that runs during the weekday. Does anyone know if that's allowable?",

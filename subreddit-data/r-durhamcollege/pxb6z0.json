    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nI am anxiously awaiting to hear about the practical nursing program for January 2022 intake. I was wondering if anyone knew the probability of getting into the flex delivery? I took pre-health at Durham and received a 4.8 GPA from both semesters...   \nI was already accepted to Fanshawe for January but it's offered on a part time basis and takes three years to complete and I really do not want to wait for September to begin classes. So I am just wondering if anyone knows what the typical average is for a spot in the program and how many spots there are?",

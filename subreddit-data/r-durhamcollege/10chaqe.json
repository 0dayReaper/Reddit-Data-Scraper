My original intention was to get a credit for the UPAS so I could put it towards the parking pass. \n\nI agree with the common good thought, for everyone else that doesn't have access to a vehicle $120 for 4 months of unlimited transportation within Durham region is affordable option.",

Check to see if you can opt out of some other fees if you're looking to save. I'm guessing you won't really be taking advantage of some ancillary services since you're on campus on the weekends. I believe you can opt out of health and dental as well.\n\n[https://portal.mycampus.ca/mycampusfiles/dc/student/howto/How\\_to\\_opt\\_out\\_of\\_ancillary\\_fees.pdf](https://portal.mycampus.ca/mycampusfiles/dc/student/howto/How_to_opt_out_of_ancillary_fees.pdf) \\- I found this old PDF online, I don't know if it still applies but worth checking out.

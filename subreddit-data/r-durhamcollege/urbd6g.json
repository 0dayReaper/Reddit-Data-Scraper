            "comment": "In the Summer semester, its very difficult to find faculty willing/able to teach. Some faculty can only teach for a certain amount of time and have to take their vacation (part of the contract). Depending on the course you can see if there is an alternative way to take it (check out DC PPL) like online, or another semester. There is a grace period for dropping out, but it all depends on what semester you are currently in. If you are taking your first semester, then there is usually a certain amount of time that you can withdrawal and get a refund, but like the other person said take the time to go to Student Services and explain the issue; they will more than be willing to accommodate anything you need.",

Timetable changes are a bitch and a half, had a similar thing happened to me and I wound up dropping out too. I was adamant about not having any weekend classes, but they kept switching me to weekend classes and it was a never ending bakc and forth. I regret going back to school, with all the shit they pulled, and sullied my opinion of the school overall.",

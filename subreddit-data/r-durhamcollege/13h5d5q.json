Each time you ate it removes \u201c1 meal\u201d from your semester\u2019s meal total.\n\nFor lunch &amp; dinner they had a subway-style sandwich person, a burger section wth (usually) lukewarm fries, a salad bar, one section I don\u2019t remember, and then another section would rotate different meals; like fried chicken, turkey, spaghetti, etc.\n\nBreakfasts were cereal &amp; eggs, but I usually just bought cereal at the No Frills. (It was like an hour\u2019s walk or 20 minute bus ride.)\n\nThey also had \u201cbagged lunches\u201d which were a ripoff. Like a sandwich, juice box, and apple. Compared to the all-you-can-eat buffet, a waste of money.\n\nI wasn\u2019t concerned with health back then so the Subs, fries, burgers were good for me. In hindsight, it probably wasn\u2019t the healthiest food.",

I've visited a few times since and it seems like they have a lot of community events now and if the cost isn't a barrier for you I recommend going for it and moving out with the people you meet after a year to an apartment nearby.",

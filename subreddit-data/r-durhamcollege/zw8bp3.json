    "postText": "So I have a two hour break on Monday\u2019s and I\u2019d love to go fishing during it starting March. I was looking down thickson and saw a trail but there\u2019s houses along the water. I don\u2019t know if they own all of the shoreline and google maps isn\u2019t very clear, my fishing app isn\u2019t either.\n\nAs much as I love fishing and my parents would kill me if I got arrested for something like trespassing. If anyone knows if that area is legal or any other (somewhat) legal spot, lemme know",

I definitely don\u2019t know if it\u2019s legal though but they have a centre and lifeguards on the beach side that\u2019s better weather you could probably ask them, they would know. Just make sure you have an actual fishing license lol",

Keep following the trail and eventually you will find it. The trail has some cool wooden bridges over swamps too. Not sure if it\u2019s the best for fishing but I recommend you check it out.",

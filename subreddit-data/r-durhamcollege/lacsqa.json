Do you have any placements during the first few months between May and December as a part of the course content.\n\nHow was your experience during the first year?\n\nThanks in advance \u263a",

Your clinicals are most likely to be in your own area, but really could be anywhere...I chose the flex because I wanted to be available to my family during the week (doctors appointments, parent-teacher interviews, etc...) and at least on the weekend I can still get in some quality time with them. The regular program is doable but I think it would create stress. That's just me though. \nWhat's your gut leaning towards?",

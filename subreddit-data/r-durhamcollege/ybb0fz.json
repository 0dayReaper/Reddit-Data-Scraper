            "comment": "Can\u2019t speak on the Vegetarian options, but I found when I lived in Simcoe I was a lot less connected with the community. I only ever visited South once or twice but when I was there it seemed much more like people hung out. \n\nHowever, Simcoe is much closer to the Main Street, closer to restaurants. It\u2019s all about the pros/cons.\n\nIf you want more community, more game rooms, more event nights with people, but ok with less accessibility to the Main Street of restaurants/no convenience store right next to the building, then I\u2019ll suggest South\n\nIf you want to be by the street, closer to the front of campus, and a quieter building, I\u2019d say go with simcoe.",

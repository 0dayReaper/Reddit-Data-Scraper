This is mandatory as this gives you access to Evolve where many courses provide their content &amp; quizzes as well as charting worth marks. \nThere is no way around not buying the online bundle.\n\nThe bundle covers the whole first year, it was roughly $1200",

My midterms were not ready yet at this point either. My other marks were only submitted a few weeks ago but were 88 and 92.\n\nI'm not sure what the average is but when I spoke with DC they said that September was the most competitive because of the large pool that apply to it. I'd give them a call and find out what the September average is.\n\nTry your best with you marks but also apply to the January intake as a backup.",

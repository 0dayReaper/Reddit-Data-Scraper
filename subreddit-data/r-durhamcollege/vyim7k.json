Can anyone let me know what to expect or how I can get myself ready for the program? Any advice is appreciated. :) \n\nAlso if you are a first year starting in September let me know!",

            "comment": "FOLLOWING!!! I\u2019m also starting dental hygiene this September :) \n\nI\u2019m a level 2 DA and the schooling was quite similar in terms of work load and courses. It\u2019s a LOT. Biggest thing I\u2019d suggest is a planner and write down all your due dates at the start when you get your syllabus. Try to always be a week ahead with readings. Classes like rad, dental materials, and clinic have lab portions as well as theories so that\u2019s why you may see multiples of each when we pick our timetables on the 28th. \n\nYou wanna get items like: \nA big clinic box with a handle on it (Walmart or Canadian tire), hair ties, hair brush, sheet protectors, a big binder for clinic and rad notes, paper, dividers, note books, sticky notes, white out, an assortment of black, green, and red pens (we use them for charting), a good laptop with word on it, white socks (they tend to be very picky on having coloured socks), que cards come in handy for studying imo, pencils, honestly that\u2019s basically all I got. Plus refer to the email about getting things like scrubs, gloves/masks, and the shoe requirements. Everything in clinic has to be 100% wipeable so all papers you take into rad or clinic have to be in the sheet protectors :) DM me if you have any other questions. I\u2019m pretty knowledgeable in dental type stuff!! I\u2019ve been a DA for over a year now and my closest friends are hygienists :)",

I heard that the workload is a lot, which is why I\u2019m trying to prepare myself as much as I can! \n\nI\u2019m sure I will have many more questions as we get closer to start, so I will DM you!",

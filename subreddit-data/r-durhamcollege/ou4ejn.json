I saw Durham\u2019s Welding engineering technician program and automotive tech and management and want to apply. However I haven\u2019t really been to Durham and I don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s going there or in either of those programs.\n\nIs anyone taking those two programs? If so are they any good and do you learn a lot? How hard was it to find a job with the degree you earned?",

I want to get an IUD as I don\u2019t enjoy my boyfriend using condoms but I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a way for me to secretly do it. Does anyone know if the college offers this service? I\u2019m at Whitby so I doubt they do there but does Oshawa have anything like that?",

Perhaps they can take cash?",

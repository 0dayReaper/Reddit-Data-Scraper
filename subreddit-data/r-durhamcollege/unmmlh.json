I was wondering if there's any others who went to Durham for a certificate/1 year program and planned on participating in the upcoming convocation.\n\nEdit: grammar",

I'm sure they want to have as many grads as possible at this event.\n\nWhatever you decide, congratulations, and best of luck on whatever you decide to do next.",

But mind you as an Alumni now, I don't regret it but I do think it would've been cool to go at least. Also, I'm speaking at one of the ceremonies this year, so I guess this way I do get to go after all.",

We're talking about places like remote First-Nation reserves or significantly smaller hospitals, not heavily funded (in contrast to the former) healthcare networks such as Lakeridge.\n\nOutside of London, Kingston, and Ottawa, there are A LOT of rural spaces with inadequate healthcare. Go up North, it's even worse.",

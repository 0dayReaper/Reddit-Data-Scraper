    "postText": "Seriously, two of the blocks have Saturday classes? The one block that doesn't have Saturday classes have classes go super late more than once. Seriously, with bus schedules as they are, and I'm sure people have other responsibilities outside of classes, what the hell were they thinking? these schedules are barely conducive to productivity. Almost forgot to mention, these are all in person classes I'm talking about. If you want to make class super late, or on weekends, at least put them online so people have a bit more flexibility. ",

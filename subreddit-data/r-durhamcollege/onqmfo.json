    "postText": "I'm a male with an undergrad from UOIT in Health Science who is interested in the Dental Hygiene program at Durham College. \n\nDoes anyone have any experience with the program and if there are any males?\n\nAlso does applying with a university degree and great grades help at all for admission?\n\nAlso, does anyone know what the job market is currently like for dental hygienists? I can't seem to find reliable information on availability, wages, etc.\n\nI've also heard that dental hygienists can have problems with their back, wrists, and hands. Is this true? Does anyone know about this?\n\nI'd appreciate ANY feedback you can provide! Thank you!",

Finish and pivot if you should dare. A uni degree is weighted diff. Its over subscribed as is rpn and paramedic.\n\nGoogle ont college over subscribed programs for an idea of GPA cut off. Good luck.",

Good luck and congrats on the career path. Far too many nonsense programs and no jobs or trash pay. Stay on top of your studies. Make use of placements to network. Get references. Profs who got experience know people. Acquire 3 references minimum.",

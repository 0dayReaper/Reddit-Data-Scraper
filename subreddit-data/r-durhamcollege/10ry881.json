    "postText": "Hello Durham College,\n\nI'm a post-doctoral researcher at Royal Roads University in Victoria working with a team (funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada: grant #936-2021-00275) conducting research about men\u2019s experiences as witnesses of gender-based online abuse and the reasons why they may or may not intervene in such situations.\n\nOur study seeks to:\n\n1. understand how men view gender-based online abuse\n\n2. collect stories from men about times when they have witnessed gender-based online abuse happen to other people\n\n3. identify the reasons why men choose to intervene or not when they witness gender-based online abuse\n\nSpecifically, we would like to talk with men between ages 18-30 who have witnessed gender-based online abuse (this could include: unwanted sexual remarks, trolling, hate-speech, public shaming, non-consensual posting of sexual media, threats, doxing, cyberstalking, and harassment). We'd like to schedule you for a research interview on Zoom lasting up to 1 hour to discuss your experiences. You will be compensated for your time with your choice of a $10 Amazon gift card or a $10 donation to either the Coalition to End Violence Against Women or the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada.\n\nIf you are interested in participating in this research, you can sign up by completing our brief recruitment survey here: https://www.surveymonkey.ca/r/RZ6WGWZ\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to send me a message or post it here. Thanks!",

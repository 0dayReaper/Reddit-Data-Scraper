            "comment": "911 alumni here. It may have adapted since I took it in 2010-2012 but the program was good. The only thing I wish that had more of (and hopefully do now) was more useful/transferable certification training. Finding jobs after graduation was tough. It's a competitive market and if you want 911 dispatch they are far and few between. The hiring process is also quite lengthy as well. There are a select few fellow alumni I know of working as a 911 dispatcher. They were the ones that were dead set on working in that field. Others are working at call centres like CAA or Concentrix. It should go without saying this field is not for the faint of heart. I myself wish I had waited until I was sure what I wanted to take. 10 years later I'm back at Durham for Rec &amp; Leisure. So my advice to you is be very sure this is what you want to pursue as it can be quite limiting. Maybe even book a meeting/tour with the department head. Hope this was helpful, cheers!",

I just want to say, based on the programs you've been accepted in, have you thought about doing a university-level program? For this career, and those others, your odds are far better and more transferable to other jobs with university.",

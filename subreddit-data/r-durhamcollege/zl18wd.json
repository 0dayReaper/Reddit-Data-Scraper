    "postText": "Hi, I recently got accepted into the Advanced Pre-Health program and the Dental Assisting and I plan to do hygiene afterwards. I was wondering if anyone has gone through the pre-health program and what was your average that got you accepted into the DH program. Also is there any advantage  to doing assisting vs pre health? And do applicants take any placement test? What has been your experience with the prehealth program?",

I finished pre health with a 97% average. The class average of people accepted into my intake for hygiene at Durham was 94%. So stay above 95% average and you\u2019re guaranteed a spot. DA does not help you get into hygiene, it will reduce your course load though. You get out of radiography and dental materials. It\u2019s a challenging but very rewarding program here and the professors are amazing!",

I took advanced pre health all online and I had physics 2nd sem but it wasn\u2019t too bad. But because mine was all online, my labs were too so, I don\u2019t know how in person labs go. \n\nHygiene at Durham is fast tracked. It\u2019s a 3 year program and we get done in 2.5 years. Course load for hygiene is heavy. But worth it. About 8,9 classes first and 2nd sem. 2 clinics a week, plus radiography lab sem 2.",

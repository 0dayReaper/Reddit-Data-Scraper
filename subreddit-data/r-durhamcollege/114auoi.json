I\u2019ve taken a gap year after grade 12 so I just want to review everything that I need for this program.",

            "comment": "You will get an email shortly (depending on your intake) with a list of stuff you need. You will need a medical form filled out by your doctor as well as TB shots (don\u2019t wait for this, do it ASAP as I\u2019ve seen it take up to 2 weeks to complete. This form you will need your vaccination history and blood work done. You will also need your CPR level C. It has to be that level. Your scrub pants and jacket can be purchased from Durham medical along with your gloves and masks. You have to supply your own throughout the program. These are also sold at the bookstore at Durham college. You will also need a black \u201cdental\u201d t shirt that we wear underneath. You will need plain white shoes with leather on top. It can\u2019t be mesh. I just got cheap roxy ones that were on clearance at sportscheck. You will also need a toolbox\u2026 about 17-19 inches. Don\u2019t get any larger as it won\u2019t fit in your locker. Just about everything else is supplied for you in sem 1. \n\nFor textbooks\u2026 don\u2019t waste your money. The only ones you will need is the Darby Walsh and the perio instrumentation one (you will take that to clinic when you get into probe and explorer and then scaling instruments in Sem 2). Im Sem 2 now and I have yet to touch any of the other textbooks. \n\nHope this helps! If you have any other questions, feel free to message. And good luck in the program!",

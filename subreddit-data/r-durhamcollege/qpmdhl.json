This sub isn't used very often.\n\nAccounting is one of those things where difficulty is incredibly subjective.\n\nTake advantage of the bridging programs if you can. It reduces the cost and expedites the process of gaining a degree.\n\nIf you bridge to Commerce though, make sure you are well versed in the other subjects as well. The bridging program is quite robust.\n\nEdit: Are you from the area? What made you apply to Durham College vs other schools? Is it convenience for a local Institution? Where else would you consider going if it wasn't DC?",

I applied to Seneca and Centennial and got in as well and yet I went to Durham. Would say most likely because it closer to Ontario tech and that would make it easy for me transfer for the Direct entry : commerce at Otu. \n Also is there a more active sub for durham? \n\nAre you also going to durham?",

The U-PASS should cover it since the 900 line is Durham Region Transit.\n\nIt may be worth reaching out to OnTech admin to see if your diploma would carry into their bridging program if you achieve it somewhere such as Seneca or Centennial as well. They should be able to give you the answers you need.\n\nHave you checked this page out? This may give you some additional insight.\n\nhttps://ontariotechu.ca/programs/college-to-university-transfer/business/commerce-bridge/index.php",

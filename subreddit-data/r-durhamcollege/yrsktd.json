    "postText": "To be blunt, considering the campus is between 50 highway death traps, is the bus the only option for getting to grocery stores or are there secret walking bridges known only to Whitby residents? I am not including the Bistro67 in my food endeavors. \nAre there any other actual food places for students within the campus such as a burger or pizza mini front in the cafeteria/anywhere in the campus buildings or is that a pipedream?\nAny hot water canisters or microwaves in the common areas/cafeteria?",

There is also a small cafeteria and a Tim Horton's in the main building.\n\n[https://goo.gl/maps/yVvqwWd7jxKNqrqG7](https://goo.gl/maps/yVvqwWd7jxKNqrqG7) \\- There's a Walmart that's a 12-minute bus ride, as a student you do have access to the UPASS. I don't know the exact transit routes but there are options. There is also an RCSS and Sobey's within a short bus ride. The Oshawa Centre is nearby too. The Landmark Cinema plaza has plenty of options as well.\n\nThey do have microwaves in the common areas, afaik.\n\nEdit: There are some food options in the plaza at Walmart too.",

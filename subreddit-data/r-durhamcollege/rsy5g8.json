If it were up to them, they would have as many people as possible doing in-person education but of course, there is a lot of risk involved with that based on government guidelines and they can't stray away from what they are being told to do.\n\nThis is an issue across all Institutions in the province, not just with Durham College. It's short-sighted to make such a speculation.\n\nEdit: added more\n\nEvery industry is dealing with the same issues surrounding the variants. When COVID hit in March of 2020, we all thought it would have been 3 weeks. Think about that for a moment.",

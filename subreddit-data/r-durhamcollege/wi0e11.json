    "postText": "Hi. I have a real quick question about Durham colleges schedule. If you are in a two year (4 semester) program starting this sept. When do the semester run?  I assume sem 1 is from sept to end Dec, what about 2,3 and 4?\n\nBecause I saw some winter semester that runs from Nov and some spring that run starting March. \n\nThanks in advance.",

Fast tracks and January starts are different. Some courses are offered as weekend deliveries as well.",

Oshawa is a bedroom community (meaning a lot of people who live here commute to Toronto),  with tons of daycares. That being said, you'll be competing against all your classmates for those same positions, so if you get an in somewhere, take it.",

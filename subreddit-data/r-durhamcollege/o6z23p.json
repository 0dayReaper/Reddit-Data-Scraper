I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a highly competitive program so that might be a reason it was so fast. I applied and accepted the offer to the Pre-Heath program, but I am on the waitlist for the online version. \n\nI received my credentials to login to my campus on May 20th when I received an email acknowledging my application.",

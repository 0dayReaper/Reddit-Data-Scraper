The prof I have teaches the best and I find his lectures super helpful and insightful. \n\nBut the school isn\u2019t great. I find it hard to fit in and the people here aren\u2019t really nice. I\u2019m a domestic student just an fyi. Just my personal experience. But for the program you\u2019re going into Durham would be a great fit.",

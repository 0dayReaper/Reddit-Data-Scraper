    "postText": "Hey, doing youtube for fun and thought a great way to make it more visually interesting is to have an animated character similar to other channels you've probably seen.  Sadly, I don't have the time to do it, so I thought if someone is down to have some fun drawing for the vids and voice, if you want to as well. Then, I am down. I can link my channel if you guys are interested. I mostly do nerdy news and reactions. \n\nI'm not making money on this obviously but if you want something for your portfolio or just have a fun hobby, then I hope you reach out.",

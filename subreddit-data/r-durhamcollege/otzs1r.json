Got student ID on 22nd but I am still under review, how much longer do I have to wait for a confirmation in your opinion? And also, as an international student, are part time job availablities good or it's a struggle?",

Former prof. A real people person. Good luck. Btw if you attend in person, attend the international events for students. It's great to network and make friends. Lots of international students from everywhere including India. My buddy and classmate is from India. Very hard working and smart guy. Works lots too and has a high GPA.",

I did an international chat with them on the web and they replied it can take up to 3-5weeks to process the application also it depends upon the course that u have applied for, I had applied for human resource management. So I think It will take some time to get back to you. and as for your other question I had done a bit of research and found that part-time isn't hard to find in cities but outside it can be a problem.",

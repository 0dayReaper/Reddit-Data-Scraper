What's the placement rate?\n\nI got accepted to a post graduate certificate program at Durham College that has an optional work term I'm wondering if it will actually help me find related work. \n\nI'm currently working in a related job to my first degree but not liking it. Hoping the post grad program will move me in a better direction.",

            "comment": "Hi dariusCubed,\n\n1. The coop office spends all day every day hunting down, vetting and communicating placement opportunitites. They are very helpful in my experiece.\n2. Yes, coop placements are *required* by policy to be relevant to the field of work the student is studying for.\n3. It is not unusual for the number of opportunities to be less than the number of students in the coop stream. For that reason it is highly recommended to also seek out and advocate your coop yourself and not rely on the school necessarily. It is a competitive process where interviewing well makes the difference.\n\nCoop and internship placements are extremely valuable today as employers consider them to be months long interviews. Months where they can invest time in training you without the risk of hiring someone who isn't incapable of actually doing the work.\n\nThe post graduate certs are specifically meant to help people make shifts in their career, so it should be a quick pivot if all goes well.",

Idw if that's what you meant by \"advocating your coop for yourself\".",

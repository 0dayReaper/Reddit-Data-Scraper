Tbh I had to go back for pre health before getting accepted bc they still go off your highschool grades regardless of the DA certificate. It does get you advanced standing, but you still need the grades. For Sept we had over 800 applicants and our acceptance rate was a 94%. My prehealth average was a 95%. Hope that helps!",

The thing is, this is an extremely hard and demanding program and pre health helps you adjust to college expectations. I would apply to both the DH program and a Prehealth program. That way you have a backup if you don\u2019t get in the first round!. I\u2019m a dental assistant and I\u2019ve done prehealth and this program is kicking my ass lol. Doable but you need to be willing to put the work in. You have 0 social life",

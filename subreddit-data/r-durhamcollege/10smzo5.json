Which intake should I accept? May or September? I'm leaning towards May since I'm an older student and I figure there will be more people my age in the May intake.",

You only have 20 classmates compared to the 40 we start with in sept which is beneficial for you in clinic as you\u2019re able to get more 1 on 1 time with the instructors. It\u2019s an amazing program and you\u2019ll love the professors. If you have any questions about the program, feel free to message me!",

You have no life in this program, so enjoy it while you can. Stay focused and dedicated and it will pay off. The semesters get better as they go!",

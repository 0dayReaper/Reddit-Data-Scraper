I just find it weird that I can use the parking pass but haven\u2019t paid yet so I was wondering if there was something wrong. But Ill just keep checking that site for anything. Thanks so much!",

They'll invoice you monthly for it.\n\nDisregard this other person's advice about canceling to see if it still works. It won't. I'd recommend being proactive and addressing it.\n\nThe last thing you want is to have to make a lump sum payment when you didn't intend on it.",

Did you have monthly parking? If so did you get your invoices at the end of the month? And Thanks for the advice!",

            "comment": "Used to be countless complaints about the endless yelling, screaming, and general noise from playing. I think it was more about the profanity and yelling than anything though. I don't think you can really police or govern it though without having someone sign out the equipment to play like it used to be.\n\nNot fair to paint everyone with the same brush but it used to get out of hand.\n\nThe solution would be to provide a better space for socializing instead of taking it away but space is so limited at that campus. They need their own student centre, not just a lounge.",

It\u2019s no fair that we have to take an hour long crammed bus ride to Oshawa just to enjoy what we pay for. \n\nIt was fun watching people play, the lounge however always has the same people using the stuff",

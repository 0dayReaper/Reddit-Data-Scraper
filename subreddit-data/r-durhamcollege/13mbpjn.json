    "postText": "Hey guys, I just started my practical nursing program and after reviewing my courses, I realized how tough this program actually is, I\u2019ve always wanted to be a nurse and I\u2019m 26 years old and I left my old job just to start school again. I am feeling really overwhelmed and anxious and nervous about school. I don\u2019t know if I should just go to part time and take my time with this program while working, or if I should just drop out. If anyone can provide any words of wisdom that would be great. Thanks.\n\nI\u2019m also worried OSAP will cut me off since I originally applied for a full school load. I want to drop anatomy and continue all of my other classes and maybe take anatomy later on.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read my post.",

A lot of my professors would be helpful with tests and exams and would give reviews. Also throughout the weeks they would sometimes give hints in class of what would be on it. I made a friend who is also 29 and what works for her is taking 4 courses at a time and taking this throughout the fall, winter and summer. She says it works well for her cause she also has to work and is able to focus on each course more.",

It happends to me every start of a semester and I\u2019ve taken 2 previous programs.  Everyone feels like this especially if your new to the college life so don\u2019t let that deter you because it gets better, realize that it will pass and you\u2019ll get the hang of it. Dropping out in only week 2 before you try isn\u2019t much good when you worked hard to get into the program. Yes, it\u2019s tough but it\u2019s doable-we have lots of nurses so they passed. Be kind to yourself and don\u2019t say that you suck at anything because that\u2019s why your in school, to learn!! Give it a try atleast and if you still find your struggling, reach out to your school support systems and counsellor who can assist you better for your needs. \n\nSome things that really help me are printing out each course information packet and get a yearly calendar book. Plug in every test, assignment, quiz, exam in this book. I colour coded each course as well. This way you can prioritize. Also get a weekly calendar sheet that has Sun-Saturday and prioritize what classes you\u2019ll do notes when and what\u2019s due each week. \n\nNext thing I did was make flash cards to study. Use the weekly objectives to make them so that you are studying the correct content. My course this semester is heavy so I\u2019ve stopped writing out notes and just write on the PowerPoints during lectures what the proffs add. Then I do back in and make the flash cards. I bring these with me to work, commuting to clinicals, it\u2019s an easy way to review and study. Then if you have a test on week 1-3 you can take out those cards and review them instead of reading over notes. \n\nI also used a lot of colouring pages for body systems in anatomy. I\u2019d colour them and lable them to help remember the different parts. You can also use a paper protector and a dry erase to re-lable diagrams over and over \n\nFind some friends that can help you. Share the work, split up the weekly notes and do half each and then add them together. \n\nI wish you luck!!",

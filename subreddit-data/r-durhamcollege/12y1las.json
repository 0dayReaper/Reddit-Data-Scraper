    "postText": " \n\nHello everyone, I wanted to share this ***FREE*** mental health program for individuals with mild-to-moderate anxiety. The Y Mind program is a 7-week innovative, youth informed, early intervention group-based program that helps teens and young adults manage stress and anxiety. Y Mind helps young people cope with anxiety and improve their sense of well-being by introducing them to evidence-based tools and connecting them with others. The Y Mind Program is offered by the YMCA of Greater Toronto Area. You DO NOT need a YMCA membership to join this program.\n\nTo be eligible you must:\n\n* Be between the ages of 18-30\n* Experience mild-to-moderate anxiety or stress\n* Reside in the Greater Toronto Area (spanning from Oshawa to Mississauga)\n\n\\*\\* however if you are not in the GTA, you can still join the program, you will just have to join through a different YMCA branch based on your area.\n\nIf you are interested, click on this website and fill out an inquiry form at the bottom of the page:\n\n[Y Mind | YMCA of Greater Toronto (ymcagta.org)](https://ymcagta.org/youth-programs-new/y-mind)",

    "postText": "Hi guys! \n\nHope you all are doing well during these times. I am an international student hoping to apply to the biotech  (fast-track) program. Now I see all over the college\u2019s website that the course is open for international students to pursue however, when I apply, it doesn\u2019t give me the option to choose my preferred semester. It gives me a message instead saying that they have maxed out the application pool and that they aren\u2019t accepting any other applications. \n\nI spoke with one of the representatives of the college and he told me that I can check in every week and see if there\u2019s space for my application. They say that once they\u2019ve processed some applications, there can probably be some chance for me to get mine in. \n\nMy question is, what are the chances that I will be able to get my application in? Also, has this happened to anyone who\u2019s applied/attended/graduated from the college? The only reason I\u2019m so concerned is cuz I have family close by so I can save big money I would\u2019ve spent on accommodation. \n\nPlease reply ASAP!!!",

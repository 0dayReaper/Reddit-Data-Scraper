A design course?\n\nThe problem is that Office has many different editions and some of the lessons involve hotkeys, to name just one of the drawbacks. \n\nConfirm with your course instructor just to make sure. I was explicitly told in my Business Computers II course that I had to have a PC.\n\nIf you must buy a PC, I'd recommend getting a small Chromebook and purchasing an MS Office key from G2A. It's significantly cheaper than buying the software from a local retailer.",

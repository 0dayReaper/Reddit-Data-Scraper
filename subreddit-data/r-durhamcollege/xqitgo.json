            "comment": "This campus sucks compared to George brown waterfront lol or UofT  and York. In general, there\u2019s nowhere to buy food here. Everything closes at 4pm so if you have a late class, good luck. Bring your own food. The Tim hortons is usually the self serve express mini booths. There\u2019s one actual Tim hortons. Starbucks is extra expensive here. There\u2019s booster juice too. The cafeteria has crappy food but it\u2019s cheap. It closes at 4pm as well. The closest food place near the campus is around 10 min walk to the plaza near it. \n\nWashrooms are not the best. Study spaces are not the best either. They\u2019re okay. Commuting from Brampton? That\u2019s gonna be long. Rush hour is so bad if you\u2019re driving. Bussing isn\u2019t any better either, rush hour = good luck getting on a bus cause it\u2019s always full. \n\nSorry, I\u2019m just sharing what I\u2019m experiencing in this campus so far. It\u2019s a cute small campus. It\u2019s the people that I like here. Making friends is probably the best thing I\u2019ve experienced here other than the awesome professors.\n\nAnyway, good luck! Find someone to carpool with.",

The food here (at least marketplace, starbucks and tims) have all been good, and theres tons of spots to hangout and study/relax. Most people are chill. Haven't had any issues with a group of people are the people on campus in general",

            "comment": "The faculty has great full-time paralegal instructors - especially Dalton Burger, Kandace Wileman, Sandra Smith and Laurie Marshall. Drew Samuels is awesome too - he's part-time so it isn't guaranteed you'll have a class with him though. The program itself is pretty unique, with the opportunity to complete your field placement with the Access to Justice Hub as a big selling point. \n\nIf you participate in class and do the bare minimum - you can likely achieve honour roll. This is a bit of a sidenote but this program seems to attract lots of disruptive students as well as students with major competency issues - beyond a reasonable proportion. There's tons of group work so be prepared to pull your hair out a lot. Also, a lot of the assignments are repetitive so if you get the hang of one you should be fine with the others. The price of textbooks are steep for how often you use them. You really only need the physical copy if you're in a class with Laurie Marshall or Mary Aroukatos.\n\nThe Oshawa campus is okay, I wouldn't say it's anything remarkably special. It's a quiet campus and not a lot of activity extracurricular or club wise. **Be prepared to buy a parking permit as soon as registration opens** **or you will not get one, period.** \n\nOther than that, good luck! Feel free to DM me if you have any other questions.",

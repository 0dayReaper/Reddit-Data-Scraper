Best of luck with your studies.\n\n[https://durhamcollege.ca/student-life/get-involved](https://durhamcollege.ca/student-life/get-involved) \\- I just want to share this for you to check out. I see you say you're looking for friends, I know the college and DCSA have a lot to offer in the way of social opportunities. Hopefully, you'll meet some new friends in your classes as well.\n\nWould you happen to have any particular curiosities in mind when asking what you should know before coming? Parking? Food on or around campus? Gym? Library? \n\nI also noticed that u/DCRecruitment is on Reddit now. They're an official rep for DC and they may be able to guide you with some questions.\n\nMeanwhile, this is an unofficial sub comprised mostly of students, staff, and alumni. There are some here that would be happy to help.",

He contacted the Dean of the school. The issue was resolved by the Dean the next day. Confirmation of acceptance email under 24/hrs. It shouldn't be a problem. Be proactive.",

I know a few people who have taken that, and while I think the course material doesn't require you to be in the country, it will probably be a good idea to stay, since your admission might be dependent on you staying. Also, restrictions might change and the school might go back to in person classes (even though that might be a bad idea at the time)",

    "postText": "Got an offer for the electrical engineering technician program for September, which is at the Whitby campus. I took a short tour of it in person about a year ago, and I did really like the place. However, whenever I read about what Durham College has to offer, it\u2019s all just info about the Oshawa campus. For people who have been, what are some of the best and worst parts in your opinion about the Whitby campus? Also, how\u2019s the food there?\n\nBtw if anyone else is going in September and needs a friend or anything, feel free to reach out if you\u2019d like lol (Esp people around 18 or so if there are any here,, nobody I know from high school is going here and it\u2019d be nice to know people around my age that are in the same boat haha)",

Campus is smaller than the Oshawa one since it's considered the 'Trades School' and doesn't have as many amenities, but it has amenities. It has a small gym, small library. We have a subway, Tim's, and the cafeteria isn't bad. We also have the bistro restaurant and the Pantry in the CFF building, which honestly has the best food. Parking is an issue however; get your parking pass ASAP every year.",

Most lines run every 20-30 min, and if they're running late, you'll miss a connection and have to wait, or walk. Plan ahead. There is a bus stop right at the front of the main entrance",

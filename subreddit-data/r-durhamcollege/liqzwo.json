So technically shorter, but there are no breaks between semesters and classes are from Friday to Sunday. I'm not entirely sure about the regular program but I know you get breaks between semesters and it's tad bit longer. If you find you need your weekends for work, family etc, then do regular. If you find you need during the week for those obligations, do the Flex.",

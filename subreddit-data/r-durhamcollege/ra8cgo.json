That's as far as I know, im not sure which specific program tho because it seem it was happening for a lot of programs \\~ edit i was doing some digging in FB and they still got the post there lol and apparently it was this year not last year",

Well the details is basically what i wrote above... some students file a complaint about some profs on not handling the issue well, im not really sure what kinda issue maybe relating to late grading or whatnot but yeah stuff got out of hand and they went to the school Dean and that didn't solve it lol so they decided to restricted comments on FB so things wont get blow up further",

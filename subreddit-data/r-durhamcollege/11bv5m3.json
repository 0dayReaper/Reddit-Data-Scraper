PHSU is ideal because if for whatever reason you decide not to do dental hygiene you\u2019ll be able to apply for more advanced program and uni programs!",

            "comment": "i am currently in my last sem of this program, phsc will be good for dental hygiene, there is not much of a difference in the courses. phsu can just bridge u into uni and u have to remember a little more for tests but other then that they are the same \n\npro tip: if you dont care about getting the actual certificate and just want the courses as a grade boost when first sem starts speak with kim shapre and drop 'preparing for academic success'\n\nalso first sem comm has many quizes and tests but second sem com is so much easier \n\nim sure you will do great pls lmk if u have any questions, good luck!",

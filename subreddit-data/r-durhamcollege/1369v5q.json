And what was your average? I plan to apply for the dental hygiene program after! Also would love to connect to anyone who is also starting it fall of 2023!",

Be careful to not let the high grades you get in this program inflate your ego too much, this is basically high school upgrading and when you get into DH it will be much harder. \n\nMany people have a rude awakening going from PH to their preferred program.",

Anatomy by far is the hardest of the classes. keep a calendar with all due dates and keep organised, never miss a live/in person class either as its easy to fall behind, its a lot of ppt's and handouts.... you will be fine.",

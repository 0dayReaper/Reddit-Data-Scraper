    "postText": "The teachers are great it\u2019s the higher ups that are the problem! They kept delaying my graduation saying I didn\u2019t have enough credits and I didn\u2019t complete my curriculum (every time I called or e-mailed I received a different answer. I did have enough credits, did complete my entire curriculum, and had well above the required GPA to graduate). They told me I needed to take 3 extra classes (that were not apart of my curriculum when I applied or started attending the school), and get them done in one semester (which would have been impossible to do due to the fact that they do not offer these classes within the same semesters). I wasted 2000 dollars on classes I did not need and was pressured into taking (by a faculty member), on top of that wasted well over 2000 dollars on an attempt to apply for these 3 classes (when applying that\u2019s when I found out they didn\u2019t offer them all in one semester, although they still took my money from me for all the classes, I applied for an extra semester extension in hopes they would have the class in the next semester). Come to find out I was eligible for graduation and graduated on they day that I wrapped up my one class/my birthday. I understand college is a money grab, I knew that coming into it, but damn I should\u2019ve just gotten jumped. I would have lost all my money then to, and it would\u2019ve went by faster (and caused less stress).",

Maybe over time this subreddit will become very active indeed.\n\nI don't know much about this college other than the fact that it offers clubs, and camps. And of course the location too. So, I can't say anything that will help you, other than just \"hang in there\". God, that's a cheesy line. Like cat holding a poster on a ledge cheesey.\n\nBut anyways, I'll be taking the mechanical engineering technology program over the fall term. Just hope, that they improve by then.\n\nBy the way, which program are you in right now?\nWould love to hear, some cool STEM major input on the school or something.",

At the time this was happening I was in a Social Service Work program (SSW), but the second I graduated from this program I got into a policing program (this specific program revolves around detective work, I\u2019m good at researching), and I am moving ahead of schedule to graduation in this program so I\u2019m very excited about it!",

I\u2019m currently taking a course that Durham didn\u2019t even give me the proper book list for and I had to waste my money since they don\u2019t wanna do anything about it. If you want an education through YouTube, this is the school for you.",

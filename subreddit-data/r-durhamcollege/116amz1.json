    "postText": "I've decided to delete the DC Discord due to inactivity, mainly on my part, for now. For the last couple of months the autobot say welcoming people and counting them as the *XXth/rd* member to join. It seemed like it was the 63rd person to join over and over the past few months. There is very little growth.\n\nI may bring it back in the future. Just don't see a point for now.\n\nThanks",

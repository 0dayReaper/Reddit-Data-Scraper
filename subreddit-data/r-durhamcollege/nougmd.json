There are plenty of free resources on the web to get you started.\n\nIf you have access to MyCampus you can find the course outlines from last year and they aren't likely to have changed greatly. Those will detail what you could focus on to get yourself better prepared.",

I suggest relaxing and working on other areas of your life while you wait or engaging interests in the area you are going to study.\nAs for the college, it has excellent resources but like most places, you get out of it what you put in. \nI hope this helps",

I hope you have a splendid time in DC. Things will get better with the province reopening. If you have specific questions I'll try and answer them, but keep in mind I was in a program unrelated to yours and pre-pandemic.",

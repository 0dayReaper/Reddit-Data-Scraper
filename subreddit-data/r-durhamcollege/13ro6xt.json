    "postText": " \n\nHello everyone,\n\nI'm an undergraduate student at another university, and I was looking through programs at Durham College and have been interested in applying for the Dental OA program. I was wondering how to apply for the program since I'm not looking to transfer but earn the certification.\n\nIf anyone is in this program, can you share your experience so far? Also if you have completed this certification, how has finding well-paying jobs been for you? Is the certificate worth it?\n\nAny help/comments will be greatly appreciated!",

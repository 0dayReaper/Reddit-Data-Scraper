I have college math next semester I\u2019m aiming for a 75.\n\nI\u2019m just curious about the average of students that actually get into the program because I know comp sci/programming is highly competitive so I want to be prepared.\n\nAlso if you know of any other options for computer programming if that\u2019s not possible.",

It looks like the requirement is just 12C/U English &amp; Math. \n\n[https://durhamcollege.ca/programs/computer-programming-two-year#tabOverview](https://durhamcollege.ca/programs/computer-programming-two-year#tabOverview)\n\nIf you're looking for a September intake, it doesn't appear that there is any waitlist atm.\n\nBest of luck with your studies.",

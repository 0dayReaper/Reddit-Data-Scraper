There isn't enough time for everyone to get quality hands on experience. \n\nI heard Georgian College has several booths, and they actually have real patients come in for hearing screenings rather than practicing on fellow students.\n\nMy biggest issue with DC is their lack of support for helping students find a placement. It's been incredibly frustrating. Profs and fellow students are great but the admin is very unhelpful, in my experience.",

Niagara has a fully functioning assisting clinic where you\u2019re able to assist real dentists on simple procedures such as fillings. I highly suggest going to a college that has fully functioning clinics. Durhams DA clinic is not fully functioning, like the hygiene clinic is. I highly suggest Niagara or Georgian for DA :)",

Just curious as to how long it takes the school to process the deposit so I can gain access to my actual school account. Do you get an email once the deposit has been received?",

I have all of my forms filled, just doing cpr in august and then I\u2019ll be ready to upload it all to be cleared for school. I hate leaving things to the last second lol",

The medical forms take 2 weeks in total to complete because you have to do a 2 step tb test (7-12 days in between each other) so that was a whole process and now 2 full days of cpr and I still have to do modules and upload those certificates like ugh. I want it all done so I can enjoy the rest of my summer before I\u2019m back to stress city",

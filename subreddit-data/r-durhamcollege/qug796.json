Wanted to ask if you entered it and if it is worth it. it does have co-op as well, which I'm assuming would be quite helpful since I have no exp in this field but am interested to learn a trade. let me know your thoughts. thx!",

So I\u2019ll start with the program, you learn 5 different welding processes over the course of 4 semesters. The program itself is amazing and you do learn a lot. It is very fast pace so you don\u2019t have much time to get good at what you\u2019re doing so skipping class will be detrimental. In terms of co-op, it\u2019s $425 extra and competitive. Maintain a GPA of 4.0 during your first semester and hope your friends aren\u2019t going into the program as they only accept 20 or so students. Also, right when you hear you\u2019re in co-op, start looking for a job in January. Send out resumes everywhere. You have until the end of may to find a co-op, I thankfully found one but the amount of people looking for co-op students was very low.",

I find a lot of my classmates don\u2019t care about their grade and don\u2019t take the program seriously. You won\u2019t make as many friends but you\u2019ll be good. Befriend your teachers as well, many of them have a lot of influence on surrounding unions and companies. Also, try to go union. Currently in co-op I\u2019m making minimum wage while doing the hardest welding process (TIG) which we don\u2019t start until semester 4. \n\nIf you go union, you\u2019ll get paid $25+ per hour as an apprentice. So non-union work will be a shitty option for anyone. Unions also care more about your life than any sorta non-union company would.",

The union will train you and you\u2019ll be paid. College for trades is a very untraditional and more expensive way to get into the trades, but for someone like me who has parents that would beat me if I didn\u2019t go to college, I didn\u2019t have much of a choice. If I knew better, I would\u2019ve applied at a union and become an apprentice. College doesn\u2019t allow you to write your red seal right off the bat either, you still need 5 years worth of work experience in order to write it so these two years will delay that.",

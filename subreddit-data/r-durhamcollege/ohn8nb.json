    "postText": " I am a graduate with a BHSc from UOIT who would like to apply Biotech (Advanced fast-track) at DC. I see that the Med Lab program at UOIT allows bridging from this program to enter second year of Med Lab and I was curious if anyone has taken this bridge before or if you know anyone who has? What has their experience been like? Or how the biotech -advanced program has been for them?",

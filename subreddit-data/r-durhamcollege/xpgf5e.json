And that's not predictable at all, some people get it within a month, some don't get it even after 6. I got mine after 3 months but I know people who've got it within a month as well. If your classes start in January, DC will probably give you an extension of 30 days although you'll miss the classes in those 30 days. If you still can't make it you have the option to defer. If you have an offer letter from another college, you can apply for a visa and then change the college later",

And I completely forgot to ask for their number or social media and I'm kinda bummed about it and I don't know if I will see them again.\n\nI'm pretty sure he said his major was in Business. He had black glasses with dark brown/black hair. Beard. My guess is he is around 5'6-5'8.\n\nAnyways, If you're in this subreddit, I'm the short haired girl. Was wearing a face mask, I am in Accounting. You complimented my hair and that's how we started talking. Feel free to PM me, I'd love to get to know you.",

If this person does reach out, agree to meet in a public place and **PLEASE** do so with friends or classmates.\n\nIt sounds ridiculous but there's a reason and precedent as to why people emphasize this.\n\nEdit: Clarity.",

All applications, and official supporting documents, received by ontariocolleges.ca on or before February 1 for a fall start or October 1 for a winter start, **and February 1 for a spring start will be considered equally**. Early application is encouraged. Programs that have more individuals apply than seats available by the Equal Consideration Deadline (ECD) will be deemed highly competitive and ranked in order. The most qualified applicants will be offered seats or placed on a waiting list.",

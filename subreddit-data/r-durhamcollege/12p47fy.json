B average overall.\n\nI see the words extra experience and I am wondering if anyone else has gotten similar grade and not had to get volunteer experience to get into the program.  If volunteer experience is a significant boost to my applications, what kind of volunteering should I be looking at doing? I\u2019m hoping for a spring start in 2024\n\nAny advice is helpful",

There\u2019s a lot of schools in Scarborough you can contact and they just provide all of the exams for you to take home and finish and give it back and they\u2019ll give you a good grade (if you do well on the exams which isn\u2019t hard since it\u2019s all open book)",

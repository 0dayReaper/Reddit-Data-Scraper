    "postText": "Hi everyone,\nI'm going for an exchange program to City University for my 3rd year. I need to find curses similar to what I would have at my uni. I'm studying computer science. So, what I've found is [cs course](http://www.city.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/computer-science) and soon after I've ended up with [this](http://www.city.ac.uk/business-computing-systems/?a=104453). How do I know which of these will be in the next winter semester? Am I doing it right?\n\nthanks!\n",

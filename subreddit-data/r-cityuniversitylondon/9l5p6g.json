    "postText": "Hi all, \n\nCurrently I\u2019m studying at RHUL and was wondering if there is a possibility of being able to transfer to City university next year? Unfortunately I haven\u2019t achieved grades equal to the entry requirements for first-year entry (I got 30 points in IB but the course needs 35). But if I make up for it in the other criteria do I have a decent chance? I would be planning on taking the same course there as I do currently at RHUL. \n\nThank you for reading and I\u2019d appreciate any advice. ",

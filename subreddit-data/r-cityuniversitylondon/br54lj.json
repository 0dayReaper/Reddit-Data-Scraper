What's good? \n\nThere are about 20k students studying here, there is immense underrepresentation on this forum.\n\nCan anyone come out of the dark? Say hello?\n\nMany blessings.",

I'm sure we can find others.\n\nThere is TheStudentRoom forum, I'm thinking of promoting this subreddit on there so the community can grow.\n\nCommunity is a big part of the uni experience. Coming from a large city on the other side of the world, I'm hoping to build connections here equally as strong. \n\nThat's a unique degree! I'm hoping to get into a program related into Investment Banking. I'll hear back from them within a couple weeks- I wish the best for the both of us. \n\nWhat made you want to pursue Maritime Law?",

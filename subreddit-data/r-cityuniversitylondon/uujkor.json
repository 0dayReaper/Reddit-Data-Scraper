I have tried everything to get in touch with the school and it hasn't worked. And it's honestly really frustrating that I can't contact either the school, it's students or the representative that literally told me I could ask her anything.",

As there\u2019s two different \u201ccity law schools\u201d on google maps that both bring me to the city website. So idk which one I\u2019m going to and can\u2019t make a decision on the dorms/halls",

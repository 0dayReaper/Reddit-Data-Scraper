    "postText": "Hi, so I\u2019m an international student and I\u2019m about to start Law at the CityU. Due to COVID, I\u2019ll be staying back home for the year and I\u2019m stuck with online school which sucks for all of us. The platform we use is called Moodle, however I can only access this on my iPad/Apple devices. I tried logging into moodle though my laptop and I can\u2019t seem to get in. Is there a restriction on devices? And if so, how can I bypass that? \n\nThank you!",

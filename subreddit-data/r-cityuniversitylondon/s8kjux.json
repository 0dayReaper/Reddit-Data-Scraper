    "postText": "I have offers for Business Analytics from City University, London as well as Glasgow University. Overall ranking of Glasgow is much higher than City, but vice versa for business school rankings. Any insight into which university would be better for career opportunities would be much appreciated! I'm not sure about company tie-up, career fairs etc, so please do share any insight if possible. Thank you!",

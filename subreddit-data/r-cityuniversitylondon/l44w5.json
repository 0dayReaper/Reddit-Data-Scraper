Which professors are notable? What about things to do around the school? Thanks a lot and I look forward to meeting a redditor there!",

The journalism dept has quite a few notable professors [give some of them a Google and you'll see :).](http://www.city.ac.uk/arts/journalism/academic-staff) \nThe key thing is just to go with it. Don't stress or worry about anything, throw yourself into conversations with people - they'll probably be interested in where you come from, City is very diverse so there will be people from all over who will be interested in the other countries of the world. \n\n",

Advanced Practical Journalism: Print\nand a specialist journalism on environment (my scholarship application requires that)\n\nI know the students there come from a pretty diverse range of cities, and I'm pretty happy with that.\n\nWhat are the usual activities of students there besides class? I'm sure I'll explore London at my leisure when I get there.",

In terms of student life I'm sure you'll make a fair few friends from all over the world. Your department tends to be better in the social aspect than engineering. City is right next door to angel with plenty to do from bars and clubs provided you get a good group of people to hang out with.\n\nThere aren't many societies at City but if you fancy tennis the courts are just one tube stop away. Mostly all places in london are 10 mins away and you can walk to the river in 10-15 mins. I suggest visiting the museums at least once since it's all free and staying away from Leicester Square unless you want the whole touristy experience. There's China town which is always great, Soho, oxford circus.\nIn fact a lot of places are quite awesome to visit and offer something great. \nVisit r/London for more help.",

I'm currently finding an apartment on spareroom.co.uk and hopefully I'll get one near the campus. The nearby dorms require a six-month contract but my exchange will last only four months, that's why I can't live there. You know any better way to find an apartment/share one?",

My lectures finished a good month and a half prior to my student accommodation expiring. I ended up staying there and partying :p\n\nI suggest you get in touch with City and ask them for contact information of other students doing the same as you. That way you can share with someone in a similar situation as you. I assume you're coming from City University HK?\n\nOn a side note. I visit HK quite often because of family. So it would be good to hang out with someone else in HK when I'm there. If you're up for it that is.",

But I can find quite a few good rooms for rent online as well, I wish I can find one that I can walk to school. I'm definitely up for that, but I'll leave in early January. And you should join /r/hongkong! they just had a gathering last Friday which I unfortunately missed :(",

    "postText": "I got an undergraduate offer from Durham for Finance and from city(BAYES) for Investment &amp; Financial Risk Management. I\u2019ve heard that Durham is a strong semi-target, whilst city is a non-target for investment banking. How does placement from city compare to some tier 1 and tier 2 unis, and is is worth choosing it over Durham? I\u2019m asking, because I\u2019ve heard a lot of negative comments about city, including poor placement and reputation at undergraduate level. \n(My predicted grades are AAA)",

            "comment": "Take Bayes. I know because I had Durham as an offer along with bayes - and I\u2019m literally on the final year of ifrm. Firstly, social life is a lot better, Durham is known for having none and the people who go there are most likely not going to be your cup of tea. Secondly, the course is a lot harder and more respected than a straight finance course from Durham . Thirdly, trust me when I say - city every time and if you choose accommodation go to Romano.

Ranked very highly and good standards, lots of opportunities for geust lectures, events, networking. But you have to be prepared to button down and work consistently. Durham as I understand from previous Alumni is they are posh twats in rich social circles and not much else to attribute to the success, nice campus too. \ud83e\udd23",

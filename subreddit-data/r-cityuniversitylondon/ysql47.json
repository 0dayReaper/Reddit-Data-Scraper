    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI  wonder if anyone else has been in my predicament and can comment. I am here as a post-grad student, and due to many unfortunate circumstances,  my visa will expire in 10 weeks, and I won't be eligible to apply for the Grad Route until after it expires. \\*weeps into pillow\\*\n\nSo,  as of now, I am in an appeals process. , and I cannot even begin until Dec  7th. Then it takes up to 28 days for an answer, and I'd probably need another six weeks for grades, etc. you get the point.\n\nHas anyone dealt with this? \n\nAll  I have found is super depressing. My school told me there is an HRO  visa that students sometimes apply for interim right to stay while awaiting school appeals. But my uni has nothing else to offer me visa-wise.\n\nThey suggest I return home and not plan on returning until all these results are in. Then wait for an answer, and come back. With immigration backed up, governments a  mess, travel costs, an apartment I've lived in for a year full of items, and my husband and dog and I leaving/returning, I am desperately trying to find another way to remain here.  If I return home, I don't see sense in coming back, honestly.\n\nUnfortunately,  I just got this news two weeks ago and have been researching like a mad woman the appeals process, as well as focusing on uni/job \\[can't sponsor, sadly\\] stuff, so visa stuff is taking a bit of a back burner. Still, I now only have ten weeks to my expiry date, which is likely, not enough \\[I don't know for sure\\].\n\nLooking into work visas, I work in public health and am aware of PWV. That's probably my best option now, but any guidance available would be incredible.\n\nplease help ;-;",

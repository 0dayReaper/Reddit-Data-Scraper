We are looking for **people who are currently completing or have completed their bachelor's degree at a UK university** to participate.\n\nWe are investigating differences in attitudes towards help seeking between students who were the first in their immediate family to go to university and those who weren't. **\u00a350 Amazon eGift cards will be given out to 10 randomly chosen participants**.\n\nHere is the link to the questionnaire: [https://kclbs.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_escsfJStJdvzirr](https://kclbs.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_escsfJStJdvzirr)\n\nThanks!",

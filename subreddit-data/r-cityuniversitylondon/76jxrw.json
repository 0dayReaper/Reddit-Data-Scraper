    "postText": "Hey! \nI could really use your help if you've got a couple minutes, I'm a physical therapy student from holland and need to write a review of a scientific article, now I got a little screwed and got assigned a pretty rare injury.. I found one article that seems perfect, but my school isn't in the list of schools that can acces it.. City university London is. \nSo my question is, could you open the article, download it to PDF and mail it to me? \nThank you so much in advance!\nhttp://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1941738117720639 This is the link to the article. 1611240brink@zuyd.nl is my e-mail. \n\n",

            "comment": "The exams are only as hard as remembering the slides' content are. The module guides generally lay out what's going to be covered. Use the lecture slides to go through the topics, thoroughly, and make your notes. Then move onto the extra reading for a greater understanding of the topics.   \n\n\nBecause they generally test on what's solely on the slides, it's best to study those most intensely to get the foundations down. The extra reading is to fill in the gaps of knowledge and give a more thorough understanding of what you've got from the slides.   \n\n\nYou can do a lot of this after term but before exams. The difference you get from lectures is that:  \n\n\n1. Your lecturer might not use lecture capture. If they don't, you will only have the slides as material rather than the accompanying lecturer's audio breakdown of them, which can be extremely useful.\n2. You are more likely to be psychologically engaged with the topic the more effort you put in during term time, especially by attending lectures.\n3. Group work happens in a few lectures, but most is done in seminars and workshops where you often do work on computers and in groups. This is a practical application of what you learn and probably the best area to put the effort in after general revision.\n\nI guess with IR you may have to learn something about current affairs? Could do a lot of extra reading outside of the slides for that. But I don't take IR, so I don't know.",

    "postText": "My deadbeat indie artist roommate sacrificed herself to what\u2019s essentially the god of the seas. I still can\u2019t wrap my head around it. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s more jarring; the fact that she\u2019s gone or the way she disappeared. The beach may be accessible again and there\u2019s no threat of flooding or storm damage anymore, but one of the people I happen to have grown close to is gone and nothing can take my mind off that. Nettie Peterson is taking it even more severely for some reason. I couldn\u2019t tell you why; I suppose they might have been a little closer than I thought, but I never saw them interact all that much. Far be it from me to question her reasons for grieving, of course. I believe I have learned to give her space when she needs it, but I'll be there when she lets me in. \n\nThe apartment feels insanely empty now. It\u2019s only been one night, I know, but normally, I\u2019d fall asleep to Kit strumming her guitar until late. I woke up late today and actually knocked on her door to finally get her out of bed, my mind only catching on when ten seconds passed without a response. I have been spending the day running around town trying feverishly to spend my time *anywhere* but at home. Nettie doesn\u2019t appreciate my presence in the big house at the moment. She says she wants to be alone. I know by now that that\u2019s something I shouldn\u2019t press her on.\n\nThe diner opened its doors to customers again this morning, so I\u2019ve been hanging out there, watching Frankie Preston work. He made a joke about me stalking him, but when I got up to leave, he told me to stay and brought me more coconut water. He\u2019s a very confusing young man. My day took a bit of a turn when Elijah Carter came in. He looked around briefly, then spotted me waving to him and approached. \u201cHey, Shirley.\u201d He paused, looking at his feet. \u201cFuck, I don\u2019t really know what to say to you after\u2026 Well, after everything. I know about your roommate. Nettie told me over the phone.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome have lunch with me.\" I gestured at the empty seat across from me.\n\nEli merely stared at it in confusion. \n\nI cleared my throat. \"'Scuse me. *Please* come and have lunch with me.\"\n\nElijah chuckled dryly, tipping his head back. \"Sorry, I'm just\u2026 I didn't think you'd wanna talk to me.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"You got stabbed? On a job that I basically talked you into doing? I mean, you had doubts and I convinced you to\u2014\"\n\n\"The money was the convincing factor,\" I explained. \"I think you know this guilt is irrational.\"\n\n\"Just figured you might be mad.\"\n\nI rose to my feet, clambering up to stand atop the bench. This raised me to roughly eye level with him, and I used it to ease my arms around him. He stood frozen for a moment, then leaned forward in his tiptoes and placed a hand on my upper back. I felt his chest fall as he uttered a sigh, and he was smiling when he disentangled himself. \u201cSo, friends then?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course. Mary Markov says you saved my life. Thanks for saving my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cBullshit,\u201d he said softly, rolling his eyes. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you did, though. It\u2019s okay, take the credit.\u201d\n\nHe let go of an amused breath and moved over to sit down. \u201cSo what now, you gonna buy me something to eat?\u201d\n\nI shrugged. \u201cI might as well. I\u2019m honestly very happy to see you right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can imagine,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry all of this happened. I know it kinda never helps to say that, but\u2026 you know. For what it\u2019s worth. How\u2019s your belly?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll better,\u201d I told him, and a brief smile flew over his face before his features darkened again.\n\n\u201cDo you have any idea what we could do about Nettie?\u201d he inquired.\n\n\u201cNot one,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to reach out, but she doesn\u2019t seem to be receptive. I want to help her, of course, but she\u2019s so\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cCrushed,\u201d Eli completed my sentence. \n\n\u201cExactly. See, the thing is that we had a talk a little while ago about boundaries and I think I might be overstepping again if I pushed her on this. It\u2019s hazardous territory.\u201d I stared down at the clear liquid in my cup. \u201cI want to wait until I have a safe, low-risk plan worked out to cheer her up. Something with little possibility of failure. Right now, though\u2026 I got no clue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s sensible. I\u2019m the least affected party here, so I\u2019ll let you know when I come up with something. We\u2019ll get there. Anything to take *your* mind off things in the meantime?\u201d\n\n\u201cI really couldn\u2019t say. Everything\u2019s still so strange without her. I know she\u2019s gone, but at the same time, I keep forgetting it\u2014it doesn\u2019t *feel* like it. I guess I should try to keep myself busy, but I\u2019m not in the mood for the job hunt right now; I\u2019m just\u2026 not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI get that. I\u2019m sorta busy the rest of the week but once things have settled, I\u2019d always be happy to get burgers or whatever.\u201d He paused. \u201cWe need other hobbies, you and I. Seems like we only ever eat together.\u201d\n\nI chuckled, about to respond when Frankie materialized beside us. \u201cI got something you could do. If you fancy a wager.\u201d\n\nElijah jumped in his seat. \u201cDude, I didn\u2019t even see you coming,\u201d he breathed, palming his throat as he looked the waiter up and down. \n\nFrankie Preston grinned, looking faintly satisfied as he placed a cup of soda in front of the other man. \u201cMost people don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to make a bet with us?\u201d I repeated.\n\nHe shrugged. \u201cIf you\u2019re up for it. You know, just for fun.\u201d\n\nEli raised his brows and mouth-shrugged. \u201cLet\u2019s hear it.\u201d\n\nFrankie had obviously been more excited about the idea than he\u2019d let on, because he let out his tiny trademark gasp and practically threw himself down to sit beside us. \u201cAlright, so there\u2019s this room in the back upstairs. You can see it from the outside, too; it\u2019s the second window on the left. That\u2019s Tom\u2019s office.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom as in *Tom\u2019s Diner* Tom?\u201d Elijah queried.\n\n\u201cTom as in my boss Tom, exactly. Here\u2019s the thing, I\u2019ve worked here for a year and I have never actually laid eyes on the guy. We\u2019ve talked on the phone before, and sometimes he yells at us through the walls, but we\u2019ve never spoken face-to-face. Rhonda got me this job, she handled basically all organizational matters for me. All I know about Tom, I know from her. And yet, she hasn\u2019t been able to answer most of my questions either.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s odd,\u201d I remarked.\n\n\u201cYeah, no kidding. The door to the office is locked at all times, and he never lets anyone in. Not that I know of, at any rate. Now, here\u2019s the really interesting part.\u201d Fran paused, likely for dramatic effect. \u201cI don\u2019t think Tom ever leaves that little room. He always answers when you knock or call out to him, no matter the time of day. I have never *ever* seen or heard him go in or out of there. Granted, I haven\u2019t done many other jobs in my lifetime, but I do not think that\u2019s normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefinitely not,\u201d I agreed, humming when I got an idea. \u201cSay, what *did* you do before you started working here? Aside from\u2026 toppling shady corporate systems?\u201d\n\nFor a moment, he stayed silent, his expression growing darkly amused. \n\n\u201cWait, are you about to give me another white lie now?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cHm. No. No, I don\u2019t think I will.\u201d He twisted a string of his gum around his fingertip, gaining a disgusted glance from Elijah Carter. \u201cHow bad do you wanna know?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m curious about every aspect of your being.\u201d\n\nHe snorted. \u201cWell then. I used to be a stripper, Sunshine.\u201d\n\nEli audibly choked on his drink. I didn\u2019t really know what to say, my brain having suddenly emptied. Frankie smiled widely, slapping the tabletop with his palm before rising to his feet. \u201cEnough of that. Anyways, fifty bucks for\u2014or in the event of your failure from\u2014each of you says you can\u2019t figure out what the hell\u2019s going on up in that office.\u201d He checked his wristwatch. \u201cAnd I want results before I get off work, so you\u2019ve got five hours.\u201d\n\nEli and I exchanged pondering glances. I gave him a slight nod and he grinned, reaching up to shake the waiter\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019re on, Blondie.\u201d\n\nFrankie disappeared in the back and Elijah and I started contemplating how to go about this newfound assignment. After getting something to eat, we went around the back of the building. Behind it was the same small alley with the trash containers and the bench where Frankie sometimes takes his break. The door to the diner was shut, allowing us to move around unseen. I tipped my head back to glance up the wall, locating the window the waiter had mentioned. From down here, we couldn't see inside. \n\n\"You ready for some climbing?\" Eli asked.\n\n\"I don't think that's possible. That's a pretty high, flat wall. I wouldn't know what to hold onto.\"\n\n\"Oh shush, give me a second.\" He grabbed onto the handles of one of the containers, trying to push it only to find that the little wheels it stood on wouldn't move. He began to kick at them, fumbling for a moment, before finally letting out a pleased grunt when the large object gave in and lurched forward. He shoved it up against the wall and locked it in place. With one swift motion, he swung himself on top of it, and I briefly marveled at his physicality. I grabbed the hand he extended to me and allowed myself to be hoisted up. \n\nThe container was wobbly and I found myself concerned it would give in beneath our weight, but to my surprise, it remained steady. Elijah flattened his back to the wall, then bent his knees, squatting slightly. He gave me an expectant look and patted his thigh. I nodded, first climbing up his leg, then placing my feet on his shoulders, holding onto his outstretched hand for balance. This boosted me to the same height as the window. \n\n\"Is this good?\" Eli asked, not sounding particularly strained at all. \"What do you see?\" \n\nI frowned. \"Truth be told, nothing much.\" \n\nThe inside of the room was lying in total darkness. All I could see was a faint light coming from a computer screen in the corner and my own reflection staring back at me from the windowpane. Then, somewhere in the shadows, I thought I saw something move. \n\n\"Wait,\" I told Eli, excitement lacing my tone. \"Maybe\u2026\" Something compelled me to place my palms against the frame. My heart jolted when it gave way. It was open. Before I knew it, my weight shifted off Eli's shoulders and my upper body was hanging in the dimly-lit room. My midriff hurt intensely, the pressure of the sill digging into exactly the line of scar tissue that was still left of the knife attack. Reacting thoughtlessly, I wriggled myself further into the dark space. I let out a pitiful wine when I hit the floor, the impact nearly knocking the air out of my body. \n\n\"Shirley,\" Elijah hissed outside. \"What happened? Are you okay?\"\n\nI wasn't sure how to answer that. I groaned some affirmative sounds as I straightened up, brushing down my shirt and leggings. I felt it immediately. There was something sticky on the spots that had made contact with the floor. My knees and chest were positively coated in it. Feeling my stomach turn in disgust, I turned and raised my hands into the relative light of the computer screen. When I laid eyes on the substance that webbed my palms, I gagged. It had the same look and consistency of bloody snot, that slimy fluid the human nose and throat often emit during illness. It formed slick strings between my fingers, and I couldn't help but stare at it in shock, frozen for a moment or two. \n\nThat's when I realized that I was *sinking*. It felt as though I had stepped in mud that took a second before softening beneath my feet. I felt a soft pressure around my feet and ankles, like I had waded into morass and the heavy sludge was swirling around me. I hastily wiped my stained hand on a clean spot on my shirt and began fumbling for my phone. Soon, the beam of its flashlight cut through the darkness, and it was all that I could do to keep from screaming. \n\nThe floor beneath me was covered in a semi-solid material which I identified in utter terror to be *flesh*. Human flesh, if the pink-ish skin shielding it in places was any indicator. Other spots were red, raw and veiny, oozing a number of unnameable fluids. The whole office was pumping, pulsing; a living thing. The walls, the ceiling, every nook and cranny wore a thick meaty coat. Above it all hung the stale, coppery smell of blood. Frantically glancing about myself, I tripped and backed up against the edge of the desk. As if in response to my movements, the long, brown hairs on the larger patches of skin stood on end. I thought I could see gooseflesh forming on the wall across from me.\n\n*What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck\u2026*\n\nIt's not often that my mind blanks out like that, but as I was standing in that living, moving room, surrounded by shifting masses of flesh and muscle, I flew into a panic. My mouth had gone bone-dry; my lungs were tight and refused to draw breath. Having lost the ability to form coherent thoughts, I was almost surprised to feel my tentacles unfurling from my back. Before I could take another step, the floor abruptly shifted beneath me. The spot I had been standing in warped into an outward dent, a mount that threw me off my feet and sent me sprawling on the ground. My entire front flattened against the warm floor, the nauseating stench and far too familiar texture causing vomit to rise in my throat. I somehow managed to maintain a death grip on my phone. I pushed myself back up with all limbs available, retreating into the direction of the window. \n\nI tore it open with one tentacle and used the rest to safely lower myself to the ground outside. Finally breathing fresh air again, I greedily sucked it in, nearly beginning to hyperventilate in the process. Dots and colors danced before my inner eye and my skin felt hot to the point of ignition. I absently took note of Elijah's soothing yet decidedly confused voice beside my ear. \n\n\"Shirley? What the hell\u2026 Are you okay? Are you hurt?\" \n\n\"No,\" I pressed out. It was hard to speak against the lump in my throat. \"I-I'm fine. I think I'm fine.\"\n\nI allowed him to pull me to my feet and guide me over to the bench. I sank down on it as my legs gave in beneath me. My heart was still hammering against my ribcage. I was half expecting it to break out. \n\n\"Hang on, I'll go get that little blond freak\u2026\"\n\nI tipped my head back, still breathing heavily, and closed my eyes. The bright sun was shining down on me, its light warming my shivering form. My tentacles slowly withdrew into the skin between my shoulderblades. At last, my face stopped burning when I felt a hand grasp my own. \n\n\"Someone's earned her fifty bucks.\" Frankie's angelic voice cut through my stupor and I weakly turned my head to face him, cracking an eye open. \n\n\"I hate you,\" I whispered. \"I hate you so much it hurts.\"\n\nHe grinned. \"You think it's smart to take that tone with the man who brings you food?\"\n\nElijah plopped down on my other side. \"Would you please enlighten me as to what happened up there?\" He sounded done.\n\n\"It's a living room.\"\n\n\"You mean, like, there's a TV in there?\" Eli asked lamely.\n\n\"No. It's a *living* room. That office is\u2026 there was a computer and a desk but the rest was just *flesh*.\" My voice briefly faltered as I tried to explain what I had seen. \"I think\u2026 I think I was *inside* Tom.\"\n\nMy statement was met with silence. Finally, Elijah Carter heaved a sigh. \"I'm not even gonna question this shit anymore. Pay up, Bubbles. I need a nap.\"\n\nMoney switched hands and Elijah excused himself, leaving Frankie and me to ourselves. He regarded me with both amusement and pity, eventually dragging me along inside into the diner's bathroom so I could get cleaned up. I furiously scrubbed and wiped at my face under the cold water spewing from the faucet. The server brought me a set of his own fresh clothes which he apparently always keeps at his workplace in case of a spill. I asked him whether he'd be willing to burn my old ones, to laughter. \n\n\"No, but I'll throw them in the trash for you later,\" he promised. His jeans were too long for me, and he knelt to roll up the bottom of the pant legs so I wouldn't trip over them.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"It's nothing. I gotta say, I feel kinda guilty for getting you up to this in the first place,\" he confessed.\n\n\"I don't mind. This situation is kind of concerning, though, isn't it? Your boss.\"\n\n\"Suppose so, but as long as I get paid and he stays in those four walls, I don't think I'll mind. Anyways, I greatly appreciate you satiating my curiosity.\" He rose to his feet and started rolling up my sleeves. \"You always do exactly what I ask.\"\n\n\"Our interests align.\"\n\n\"Nah. I bet you'd rise to *any* wager I'd ever suggest. I think you'd do it for my sake.\"\n\nI don't know what possessed me at that moment. I didn't even think about kissing him; I just leaned in. \n\nFrankie yelped like a startled puppy and dodged out of the way, eyes wide. I instantly shrank back. \"I'm sorry,\" I stammered.\n\n\"Are you?\" He regarded me with stern eyes. \"I hope not.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nHe grunted. \"What you were gonna do there, I\u2026 uh. Oh, Christ, now you've gone and made me all stupid. You're pretty amazing. I feel like I ought to say that more often. Listen, you were going to kiss me and you may and I want that. A lot. But I'm a bit jumpy sometimes. I know I spoiled the moment. Let's pretend this never happened and when we next see each other, I'll be expecting it. And then I won't make chew toy sounds, okay?\"\n\nI nodded. \n\n\"Okay,\" he repeated softly, smiling as he gathered up my clothes and turned to leave.\n\nThat was that. I'm still very curious about Tom's Diner, but for the time being, I'm simply glad for the distraction, however brief it might have been. Now that I'm back home, though, everything's so clear again. Kit Sutton is gone. And I can't stop thinking about her.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13dr5g0/help_im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[2: deadbeat roommate](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13eovqy/im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_also_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[3: creepy crush](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13fnc4u/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_everyone/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[4: relocation](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13gjpwd/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_does_anybody/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[5: beach concert](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13heih5/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[6: First date](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ib2es/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_my_first/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[7: Temp work](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ja7jx/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_temp_work/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[8: roommate talk](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13k8088/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_a_talk_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[9: a dismal worldview](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13l69a9/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_the_world/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[10: warehouse](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13m8e9w/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[11: staircase](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13o0npw/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_we_visited_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[12: explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13p2dw3/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_we_might/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[13: hurt](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13q2hrx/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_i_should_not/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[14: hospital](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13r0f31/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_i_dont_like/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[15: ocean](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13s762l/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_the_day_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[17: government work](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13u20f7/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_so_this_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

The most useful thing for a companion bot would be espionage.  It's in his base code to use romantic interest to his gain.  I think that he actually really likes you but his code... He is warning you about himself.  As for the refused kiss, considering his past, he may have trauma associated with consent and certain kinds of affection.\n\nDid Kit record any of her music?  Her voice might be soothing to Nettie or it could be too soon.  If there's recordings maybe offer Nettie a copy?  I would leave it in a care package at her door. Nettie probably doesn't want you to see her as she is right now. She cannot help you with your grief and that hurts on top of her grief.  Even without recordings, put together a care package for Nettie.",

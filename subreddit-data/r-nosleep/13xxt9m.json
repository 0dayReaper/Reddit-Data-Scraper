    "postText": "\"Everyone's eyes are missing from their faces.\"\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d I asked her calmly, making note of her body language. Each time my patient spoke, she avoided eye contact entirely. She\u2019d dart her eyes around, as if scared to land on one thing for too long. Her hands were folded in her lap, and her left knee bounced rhythmically.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing there,\u201d She murmured, mind in a different place. \u201cWhere the eyes should be.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you describe it more in length?\u201d I asked.\n\nShe paused before speaking again. \u201cThey still have noses. And mouths. And eyebrows, I guess. But there\u2019s no eyes. It\u2019s just\u2026smooth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d I wrote that down. \u201cHow long have you been seeing this?\u201d She shrugged, fidgety as ever.\n\n\u201cDoes it frighten you?\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d She replied, now looking to the floor.\n\n\u201cIs that why you don\u2019t want to look at me?\u201d I began. She tensed her shoulders, so I added, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to. I\u2019m just curious.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d She spoke quietly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, I won\u2019t make you do anything you\u2019re not comfortable with.\u201d I tapped the notepad lightly with my pen, coming up with some other questions. I wondered to myself if this was a side-effect of an underlying condition, manifesting into her reality.\n\n\u201cHow about pictures? Or mirrors? Do people still look funny there?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not funny.\u201d She said bluntly, then immediately shrunk back into herself, as if expecting discipline.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brynn.\u201d I conceded. \u201cI only mean, do they still not have eyes when you\u2019re not looking directly at them?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d She nodded. \u201cBut it\u2019s worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mind telling me how so?\u201d I tried to be as inoffensive as I could with my words and tone.\n\nThe more I knew, the better understanding I had of what she was experiencing. But I also knew not to probe too much, or I lose the chance of hearing more. Some patients require lots of patience and security, and I had no problem obliging. So far Brynn had shared with me far more than she has in our previous sessions, and I wanted to see more into her world. Get an idea as to why she had done what she did, leading to her school expulsion.\n\n\u201cTheir entire face is\u2026wrong.\u201d Brynn began to explain, struggling with which words to choose. \u201cThey\u2019re warped and stretched and confusing to look at. The longer I stare, the more it changes into something worse. Until I can\u2019t look anymore and have to shield my eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds quite unpleasant,\u201d I frowned. \u201cYou said this is only in pictures and mirrors?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. For now.\u201d She breathed with a shudder.\n\n\u201cFor now?\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes, I see the faces in the real world too. In the sides of my vision. And if I look at it it goes away, but I don\u2019t think that will last for long.\u201d\n\nI sighed. I felt deeply sympathetic for her. She seemed to be battling against demons created by her mind, fueled by anxiety and stress. I tried to piece together what she told me with what I knew, and the main reason the state had hired me to help her in the first place.\n\nEven her own parents cowered before her, relieved as soon as she stepped out of their car in my driveway. It sickened me they\u2019d deny her love and support in these trying times, but I was only seeing one perspective. Brynn has yet to deliberate any issues with her family.\n\n\u201cWere you experiencing this when you attacked that girl in April?\u201d I said slowly, hoping to reintegrate the incident in her mind as unobtrusively as possible. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to talk about it, I underst-\u201c\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a girl!\u201d Brynn pleaded, finally looking towards me. She paused for a fraction of a second before snapping her head away, terrified. \u201cIt was one of them disguised as her, I swear! I would never hurt someone like that unless I had to!\u201d\n\n\u201cOk.\u201d I bit my lip, glancing at my files. \u201cSo you believe that you were in danger?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was stronger than the others.\u201d She didn\u2019t answer my question, but I chose to momentarily lean in to that comment.\n\n\u201cThe others as in the faces?\u201d I clarified.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou perceive them as\u2026other people? Not just strange faces but separate entities?\u201d\n\nI knew I should avoid putting words in her mouth, as it was best to let her come to her own conclusions, but I couldn\u2019t help myself. A part of me was morbidly curious, trying to accept how a child could brutally maim another child with nothing but a rock and her bare hands. The pictures provided from that day were visceral and disturbing. Brynn so far seems troubled, but not to this degree. Not to the degree of severe institutionalization, as the court suggested.\n\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Her face melted with relief, tears welling on her lower lashes. \u201cThey\u2019re not human. Just shadows or glitches. But they follow me everywhere! And that girl, she wanted to hurt me! She told me awful things\u2026.\u201d\n\nAnd then the tears fell as she dissolved into sobs. I reached for my tissue box and handed it to her, allowing her to get it out of her system.\n\n\u201cYou are very brave for telling me all this.\u201d I started. She had her face buried in her palms, hiccuping. \u201cWe can be done for today if it\u2019s too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d She choked. \u201cI just need a minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake all the time you need.\u201d\n\nI leaned back and glanced around the room, eyes flickering over the mirror hung on the wall behind the sofa. In the reflection was myself, my desk to the right, the window to the left spilling light from the afternoon.\n\nAnd then I saw it. Like a spec or an illusion, there was a second face over my own. One with a twisted grin, hollow eyes, pupils swelled in the sclera. I shut my eyelids and shook my head. I didn\u2019t even need to convince myself I was seeing things, I already felt so confidently I had. I opened them and saw it again, but much closer, face pressed against the other side of the mirror like it was a window.\n\nI jumped, startled, and Brynn snapped her head up. \u201cSorry,\u201d I laughed. \u201cJust had a sudden chill.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure she could tell if I was lying, but regardless she didn\u2019t push it. We concluded our session on a high note, talking about how proud I was of her progress. As soon as she left my office, I removed the mirror from the wall and stashed it into a closet.\n\nThen, I made a call.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d Brynn\u2019s mother answered, voice etched in trepidation.\n\n\u201cHi, Mrs. Barker,\u201d I began. \u201cI\u2019m calling about Brynn\u2019s progress so far in my sessions.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Mrs. Barker was timid and sheepish, speaking at a barely audible murmur. \u201cHow is she doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cReally well.\u201d I replied. \u201cBut before my next session with her, I wanted to see if I could have you and your husband come in. I want to get your perspective, if that\u2019s alright.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust us?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a session, yes.\u201d\n\nShe paused. \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d She answered.\n\nWe scheduled a time, and I hung up with an exhale.\n\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Barker arrived, I showed them to my office and had them choose their own seats. They sat on the sofa, a person\u2019s length between them.\n\nI asked then how they were, offered them some bottled water. They were very uncomfortable in each other\u2019s presence as well as my own, displaying a clear lack of trust. I wondered how long they\u2019d been like this, if it had anything to do with Brynn\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cHow long have you been together?\u201d I began, wanting to see their reaction. Subtle facial expressions and body language would notify me whether or not the subject of their relationship was one of merriment or tension.\n\n\u201cTen years,\u201d Mr. Barker replied, seemingly neutral about the topic. \u201cMarried two years before Brynn was born.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s lovely,\u201d I added. \u201cMy husband and I are coming up on our sixth year this June.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongratulations.\u201d Mrs. Barker smiled meekly.\n\n\u201cDo you have kids of your own?\u201d The husband asked.\n\n\u201cNo, we don\u2019t plan on having children.\u201d I replied. \u201cBut we do have plenty of pets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d He nodded.\n\n\u201cIs it just you three at home?\u201d I crossed my legs. \u201cAny pets of your own?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had a cat once.\u201d Mrs. Barker fidgeted with her nails, picking at her cuticles. \u201cThat was a while ago.\u201d\n\nI figured this was enough preamble before diving into the meat of the conversation. \u201cBrynn seems quite lonely,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe another pet could help her, if you\u2019re open to the idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t trust her with pets anymore.\u201d Mr. Barker stated. That piqued my interest.\n\n\u201cDo you mind telling me why?\u201d\n\nHe pondered, then shook his head.\n\n\u201cWell, I won\u2019t force your hand, of course.\u201d I began. \u201cBut this is a safe space. The more you share with me, the better I can help Brynn.\u201d\n\nHe sighed, then sunk further into the sofa. \u201cBrynn was an infant when we had the cat.\u201d He shared. \u201cHe was an older family cat from my late mother. One day, we heard Brynn crying from her crib. Julie went to check on her,\u201d He glanced over to his wife. \u201cAnd she found him in pieces.\u201d\n\n\u201cPieces?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was strewn about like he had been mauled.\u201d Julie answered. \u201cIt was\u2026horrifying.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think it might\u2019ve been an intruder? A stray dog that may have wandered in your home?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not possible. At the time we lived in an apartment, fifth story.\u201d The husband said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a large space. We would have heard someone enter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you saw the cat in the state he was in,\u201d I thought aloud. \u201cWhat was going through your mind?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I want to move on.\u201d Julie looked distressed, so I dropped the subject.\n\n\u201cAnything else peculiar with Brynn? She\u2019s told me some troubling things that she\u2019s seen as of late.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe angels?\u201d Julie raised both her brows. She saw my confusion and blushed.\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d I studied her. Angels was an interesting choice of words. I would\u2019ve understood entities, ghosts, maybe glitches. But angels was very specific. \u201cHas she called them angels?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d The husband\u2019s faced morphed into a scowl. \u201cJulie insists on calling them that.\u201d\n\nShe shot him an apprehensive glare.\n\n\u201cSo, regardless,\u201d I continued. \u201cHow long has she been talking about these\u2026angels?\u201d\n\nThe husband looked to his wife, expecting her to answer. She did the same to him. Both had some kind of silent communication between the two of them, and Julie sighed. \u201cWe really wanted to have a baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cPardon?\u201d\n\n\u201cKent and I had gotten married and wanted to have a child.\u201d Julie clarified. \u201cI got pregnant with a girl.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t what I had initially asked, but I sat back and let her continue.\n\n\u201cFive months into pregnancy, I suffered a miscarriage. It was devastating. I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself. I was living a waking nightmare and I wanted to die.\n\n\u201cThen, one day, I was at the store and I ran across an older looking woman. She approached me and said she was sorry for my loss. I don\u2019t know how she knew, and at first I was angry, telling her to screw off and leave me alone. But then she offered to help me. I was about to pass her off as crazy, but she handed me a card and told me to call her when I was ready.\n\n\u201cI wanted to throw that card away so badly. But I couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t know who this woman was, but on the card she listed herself as a \u2018fertility witch\u2019. Sounded made up but I was beside myself with grief. So I went anyway, and took Kent with me. He tried to talk me out of it but I just needed to see. Get the curiosity out of my system.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer office was the very definition of what you\u2019d expect.\u201d Kent added. \u201cShrunken heads, animal bones, dried herbs, crystals. The woman beckoned Julie to lay down and offered to perform a ritual for free. We were uncomfortable and declined, but the woman said something that rattled us. She said the name of our baby, and there was no way she would\u2019ve known. We had wanted the name to be a surprise, so only my wife and I knew.\n\n\u201cThis should have been what sent us on our way, but Julie and I felt some kind of deeper connection. This woman seemed to be legit, and we allowed her to do the ritual.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then I was pregnant again.\u201d Julie said. \u201cAs if we got a second chance, Brynn was back inside me developing as a beautiful healthy baby. We delivered her with ease. We couldn\u2019t have been happier.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then the\u2026\u2019angels\u2019 appeared.\u201d Kent\u2019s brows furrowed, his expression turning grim. \u201cThey followed Brynn everywhere, and by proxy began to haunt the people nearest her. We saw them in the dark corners of our house, the alleyways of downtown, in the reflections of the mirrors and car windows and water in the tub. We also tried to ignore them. But each birthday Brynn had, the angels would do something drastic, as if lashing out against us before fading back into distant apparitions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe death of our cat was one such instance.\u201d Julie added. \u201cThe others I don\u2019t wish to speak of, but they are similar. She\u2019d turn another year older, the angels would do something bad, and then cease to be an issue until next year. They never worsened in severity, so we falsely assumed we could manage. Prepare for what would happen and deal with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d I finally broke the silence, unsure of how to process this information. \u201cThis instance with Brynn attacking her schoolmate\u2026is it birthday related?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Julie broke into nervous tears. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re so scared.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like it\u2019s corrupting her now.\u201d Kent held his wife\u2019s hand and gave it a singular squeeze before letting go. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to bleed into everyday life and we\u2019re at our wits end.\u201d\n\nI looked at them for a moment before coming up with a response. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I find this incredibly hard to believe.\u201d I began.\n\n\u201cI know, I know.\u201d Kent looked pleading. \u201cI know how crazy it sounds. But that\u2019s why we\u2019re telling you. You\u2019re a professional child psychologist, not a psychic or paranormal nutcase. You aren\u2019t going to take my words to heart because it sounds ridiculous. But Brynn has opened up to you. She trusts you, where as any help we\u2019ve tried to get from the church or elsewhere has just made things worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryday it gets harder and harder not to be afraid.\u201d Julie continued to cry. \u201cIt\u2019s ruining our relationship with Brynn and each other. We just want to know how to help her.\u201d\n\nThat night I was tossing and turning, unable to get any rest. I was hoping to get some clarity from Brynn\u2019s parents, but what Julie and Kent shared with me only added to the confusion. Did I believe in the supernatural? Not really. But the Barkers were fully convinced that Brynn was being haunted by entities that were slowly beginning to influence her. And yet, I\u2019ve seen movies with similar plots. The brief visage of said entity in my office mirror wasn\u2019t enough proof to validate any of this as true.\n\nSo were they making this up? Why? What benefit would the Barkers have in telling me this tale of demons and witches when their child\u2019s very well being was at stake? I was the one who the state hired to see whether or not Brynn needed juvenile psychiatric treatment. She had hurt another student to the point of irreversible damage. The only reason she wasn\u2019t behind bars was because she was eight. So didn\u2019t Kent and Julie see how serious this was?\n\nI dissented these questions to my husband, leaving out names and specific details as per protocol (though if you\u2019re reading this now, that got thrown out the window.) He agreed with what I said, but also suggested I request documentation of Brynn\u2019s birth, if I was able to. Try to see if she really had \u201cbeen born again.\u201d I wasn\u2019t too keen at first with the idea, but decided it could be beneficial in helping Brynn by rooting out what was and wasn\u2019t the truth.\n\nThe documents, to my surprise, were granted. There was her birth certificate, a miscarriage certification from the state months prior, copies of tests from both times Julie was first reported to be pregnant. The timeframe in between the miscarriage certification to the birth of Brynn was\u2026strangely short. Only four months separated the two dates, which perplexed me.\n\nI knew I was beginning to tread upon territory outside my pay grade, but I was too invested. I reached out to the doctor that signed off on both documents, hoping maybe I could get some answers.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d The woman on the phone picked up after the third ring. \u201cYes, hi, my name is Dr. Grey and I\u2019m calling about one of your previous patients, Brynn Barker.\u201d The woman paused. \u201cAnd you\u2019re supposed to be..?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer psychologist,\u201d I replied, trying to find a way to justify my calling. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked by the state to begin treatment for her but I\u2019ve noticed a discrepancy in her forms of identification.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t help you. Despite her no longer being my patient, I have a confidentiality agreement.\u201d\n\nMy hopes fell. \u201cOk, I understand. Tha-\u201c\n\n\u201cBut I no longer work for that hospital anyways,\u201d She continued. \u201cSo said agreement must no longer apply, right? Not sure that\u2019s how it works but we\u2019ll roll with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I would love it if you could perhaps stop by my offic-\u201c\n\nAgain, another interruption. \u201cLet\u2019s meet somewhere else. Keep it on the down low.\u201d \u201cI understand.\u201d\n\nThat evening I met up with her at a local sports bar. I found her sitting alone at a booth, drinking a beer and staring intently at her phone. I introduced myself and we shook hands before I sat.\n\nAnd then, after I explained to her what the Barkers had told me, she shared her side of the story. It\u2019s not unheard of for a woman to be pregnant soon after the gestation period of her previous miscarriage. If she was ovulating, she could be pregnant with another baby within the week. But according to the woman, Julie had shown back in her office a month later, six months pregnant. That was medically impossible. She tried to run more tests, consult other doctors, but the higher up\u2019s ended up saying that she had made a mistake prior. But she hadn\u2019t.\n\nUndoubtedly, the fetus hadn\u2019t survived in Julie\u2019s womb. The woman even had a prognosis for the miscarriage, a cervical insufficiency. Despite this, Brynn was born healthy and it seemed the matter would get swept under the rug.\n\n\u201cThen I was approached by an older lady.\u201d She continued. \u201cThis lady wasted no time telling me that she had performed a ritual on Julie in order to allow her to be pregnant, but it appeared to have backfired. Rather than have a new child, Julie\u2019s womb appears to have reanimated her deceased child, which in the lady\u2019s words \u2018borders on necromancy.\u2019\u201d The woman shook her head.\n\n\u201cI was taken aback by the absurdity of these claims, but she told me to quit my practice at once. There are these angels that try to settle the score of death. If someone comes back to life, they intervene. I guess they can\u2019t take back the life directly, but they will take the lives of others until the scales are balanced. It\u2019s not as easy as an eye for eye. These angels will wreak all kinds of havoc and curse any who seek to get in their way. Which is why she advised I quit my job, for it would have unattended consequences there on. And so I ignored her outright.\u201d\n\nShe looked to her hands, appearing guilty. \u201cIt took the stillbirth of my next two patients for me to finally understand. Any woman I saw I\u2019d inevitably doom to suffer the loss of her child. I tried to get in contact with some of the other staff surrounding Brynn\u2019s birth. Some of them killed themselves. Some others went insane. Most vanished without a trace.\u201d\n\nThen she turned to me with a look of urgency on her face. \u201cDr. Grey, I know it\u2019s your job to help. Believe me. But Brynn cannot be saved, and you\u2019ll damn yourself the more you try to interfere. If I were you, I\u2019d tell the state she needs to be put away for the safety of herself and everyone around her.\u201d\n\nI was disgusted by her reply. So much so I stood without a single word and left the bar in a hurry. I got to my car and sat, gripping the steering wheel. After calming myself down with some deep breaths, I looked up and saw a fucked up version of Brynn behind me, reaching over with speed to grab onto my neck and strangle me. I struggled for breath and I tried to fight her off me, but it was unrelenting. I reached for my keys and stabbed one of them onto its arm, and it recoiled long enough for me to catch some air. I threw myself out of the car and fell onto the pavement, scrambling away. I turned back and saw my car was empty. I had merely stabbed my keys into the foam of my seat.\n\nNow I sit at home, after having worked up the courage to re-enter my car. I have another meeting with Brynn tomorrow. But given all I know, and all I\u2019ve seen, I\u2019m not sure what to do.\n\nI don\u2019t want to abandon a child in need. It goes against everything I stand for as a person. But I\u2019m not sure I have what it takes to give Brynn the help she needs.\n\nEven now, my husband is making dinner in the kitchen behind me. I have to turn my back against him, because every time I see him from the corner of my eye, I notice his eyes are missing from his [face.](https://www.reddit.com/user/superiortea45/comments/123zms6/collection_of_my_works/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)",

If she had a miscarriage at 5 months and then delivered a healthy baby in what would have been the original's delivery time, was the deceased baby still in her but reanimated?  There has to be a solution without killing Bryn.  Get that witch to help.",

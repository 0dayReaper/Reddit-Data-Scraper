    "postText": "I\u2019ve lived in this house for the past 23 years.\n\nJust like the past eight-thousand nights, as I was going to bed, I reached out to turn off the light switch in the stairwell. The one right at the top of the stairs, on the left-hand side as I go up.\n\nExcept it wasn\u2019t there.\n\nI stopped and looked down. My hand was pressed against blank wall. I turned around, and saw the switch on the *other* side of the stairwell.\n\n*Huh?*\n\nHad the switch always been on that side? It had been so long, I\u2019d never really paid attention to where exactly the light switch was. It was pure muscle memory. Reach out\u2026 turn off the light\u2026 go into my bedroom.\n\nI looked down. \u201cOh.\u201d I was holding a freshly-laundered sheet and pillowcase in my left hand. That stopped me from turning off the light. Instead of switching hands, my muscle memory just told my brain \u201cHey! Go ahead and turn off the light with your *other* hand!\u201d\n\nSilly brain.\n\nThere was nothing wrong.\n\nI opened the door to my bedroom and started pulling the fitted sheet over the mattress. I pulled the cloth straight, straightening out the wrinkles, neatly tucking the corners underneath. I repeated it four times, then with a sigh, got up and went into the bathroom. I reached to flick on the light\u2014\n\nBlank wall.\n\n*What the\u2026*\n\nI extended my other arm. After a second of fumbling, my fingers found the switch and flipped it on. I scowled at myself in the mirror. At the reflection of my bony hand, frozen on the light switch.\n\n*I\u2019m pretty sure the light switch was on the other side. Next to the towel rack.*\n\n*Not\u2026 there.*\n\nI walked over to the counter and pulled the bobby pins out of my hair. Then pulled it all up into a ponytail, securing it with a neon green hairtie. I reached down for the drawer to pull out my toothpaste.\n\nExcept my fingers grabbed empty air.\n\nI looked down\u2014to find the drawer pull a few inches lower than I expected it to be. \u201cGeez, what\u2019s wrong with me today?\u201d I muttered under my breath. I grabbed my toothpaste out of the drawer, squirted it on my toothbrush, and furiously brushed my teeth.\n\nI bent over the sink and cupped my hands, filling them with water. I sucked it up, swishing, and spit it out. Straightened back up\u2014\n\n*Huh?*\n\nOver my shoulder, in the mirror, the fitted sheet sat bunched up on top of the mattress.\n\nMy heart dropped. *I definitely put that sheet on.* Then I frowned. *Did I? Or did I just\u2026* think\u2026 *about doing it?* I turned around, staring at the bunched fabric. The cute little green polka dots distorted with the wrinkles.\n\nThen I shook my head and walked over to the bed. Flapped the sheet in the air, then lined up the corners. Pulled it taught, tucking each corner underneath.\n\n\u201cLooking good.\u201d\n\nI walked over to the windows and closed them. Locked them. Pulled down the blinds, then pulled the curtains over them. Without the light of the moon, the room was pitch dark, save for the sliver of golden light spilling out from the bathroom door.\n\nLeaving the bathroom light on so I wouldn\u2019t trip over myself, I sat down on the bed and turned on the desk lamp. Pulled my Kindle off the nightstand and opened the novel I\u2019d been reading. Some dramedy about two very different women switching bodies. I read for several minutes\u2014but then something caught my eye.\n\nThe mirror.\n\nIn the full-length mirror across from the bed, I could see my reflection: blankets cozily wrapped around me, cup of water on the nightstand, Kindle in hand. Except there was something horribly, horribly wrong.\n\nMy hair was down.\n\n*No.* I put my hair up in a ponytail. In the bathroom. I was sure of it\u2014otherwise, I would\u2019ve gotten my hair wet in the sink when I brushed my teeth.\n\n*Unless\u2026 maybe I absentmindedly put it back down while I was reading?*\n\nThe neon-green hairtie sat on the nightstand. I grabbed it and quickly put my hair back up. Then I stared at the mirror. My reflection stared back, eyes wide.\n\n*You\u2019re just tired.*\n\n*You\u2019ve had a hell of a day. Hell of a week. The presentation at work, fixing the cracked window in the basement all by yourself. You just need a good sleep.*\n\nI reached over and turned off the lamp.\n\nDarkness enveloped me. And it felt somehow\u2026 *too* dark. Usually there was light from *something*, even if it was just the blinking white light from my laptop, indicating sleep mode. But this was just pure darkness. Thick, heavy darkness like a fog, filling the entire room.\n\n*Go to sleep. You need sleep.*\n\nI cuddled up to my pillow, closed my eyes, and began to fall asleep\u2014\n\nMy eyes shot open.\n\n*The light.*\n\nI\u2019d left the light on in the bathroom.\n\nAnd now it was off.\n\nI pulled myself up out of bed. \u201cHello? Is anyone there?\u201d\n\n*Oh, good idea, Hannah. Announce yourself like every victim in a slasher movie ever.*\n\nGroping in the darkness, I felt for my phone. I\u2019d left it on the nightstand. Which should\u2019ve been a foot or two to my right. But as I continued to feel, my hand only fell on empty air.\n\n*Where the hell is the nightstand?!*\n\nI walked forward with slow, halting steps. Then my toe collided with something. I hissed in pain, but reached down and finally found the sleek smooth metal of my phone.\n\nI turned on the flashlight.\n\nAnd my blood ran cold.\n\nMy bed. The nightstand. It was all on the *left* side of the room, not the right. I stared at it, my heart pounding in my chest. The white light jittered across the wall as my hand shook.\n\nI turned around, towards the bathroom\u2014\n\nBut I was staring at the windows. The curtains closed tight. I whipped around, and there was the door to the bathroom\u2014on the *other* side of the room.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d\n\nI ran to the bedroom door. Turned the knob. Swung the door open and raced down the hallway\u2014\n\nThe stairs.\n\nThey didn\u2019t lead down.\n\nThey led *up.*\n\nMy flashlight followed the wooden steps as they went up\u2014turned ninety-degrees at the landing\u2014and then continued upwards. At the top, there was a shut door. A door I\u2019d seen a million times.\n\nThe door to my basement.\n\n*A dream. This has got to be a dream.* I pinched myself, screamed, tried to force myself awake. But I was still standing in the hallway. The hallway that led *up* to the basement door.\n\nI raced up the stairs and opened the door. Or tried to\u2014it only opened a few inches before the chain lock caught. I thrust my entire weight against the door, pulling the chain taut. But the door wouldn\u2019t open any further.\n\n\u201cLet me out!\u201d\n\nLight blinked on. On the other side of the door.\n\nAnd through the crack\u2026 I could see something. Something familiar. A hallway with a cuckoo clock. Cream-colored walls. An opening that led to a small, wallpapered kitchen.\n\nIt was *my* house.\n\nAnd standing in the kitchen was a woman. A woman with dark hair pulled back with a neon-green ponytail holder.\n\n*Me.*\n\nShe held a toolbox and a garbage bag. Something like glass clanked against each other with each step she took. Then she disappeared around the bend, towards the garage.\n\n\u201cHelp!\u201d I screamed. \u201cHelp me!\u201d\n\nBut no one came.\n\nI\u2019ve tried calling the police. Tried calling my mom, my friends, *anyone.* It never goes through though. It seems like I have some sort of internet connection, though, and I\u2019m not even sure where this will be seen. But I hope someone will see it.\n\nAnd I hope you can [help me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels)",

You may know better about the specifics of your situation, but from what\u2019s described here, I have two working theories:\n\nFirst, you could be dealing with imps. Definitely capable of creating the mayhem described AND creating your alternate self. In this case it could be a harmless prank, but I would still not recommend directly engaging. Perhaps they will tire of messing with you?\n\nSecondly, the broken window may have been a sort of wormhole that launched you into a chaotic spiral between alternate yet similar timelines. Crossover could lead to seeing another self, and to what seems like progressively more and more noticeable changes that are unable to be written off as the tear between realities becomes more unstable - you travelling through them would likely not be helping.\n\nI am unfortunately not an expert on either of these scenarios. I wish you luck, stay safe.",

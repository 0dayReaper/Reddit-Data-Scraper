    "postText": "Every night, no matter the weather, something walks down our street whistling softly. You can only hear it if you\u2019re in the living room or the kitchen when they walk by and it always starts at exactly 3:03. The sound starts faint, somewhere near the beginning of the lane near the Carson place. We\u2019re towards the middle of the street, so the whistling moves past us before fading away in the direction of the cul de sac.\n\nWhen I was younger, my sister and I would sneak into the kitchen some nights to listen. Mom and dad didn\u2019t like that and we\u2019d catch Hell if they found us out there but they were never too hard on us since we always stuck to the one Big Rule.\n\nDon\u2019t try to look at whatever was whistling.\n\nMy neighborhood is a funny place. I\u2019ve lived here since I was six and I love it. The houses are small but well-kept, good-sized yards, plenty of places to roam. There are a lot of other kids here my age, I turned 13 back in October. We grew up together and would always play four square in the cul de sac or roam around from back porch to back porch in the summer. This was a good place to grow up, I\u2019m old enough to see it. And there\u2019s only the two strange things here; the night whistling and the good luck.\n\nThe whistling never bothered me much. Like I said, I couldn\u2019t even hear it from my bedroom. But mom and dad don\u2019t like talking about it, so I\u2019ve stopped asking questions. My dad is a strong guy, tall and calm. He has an accent since he moved to the US as a kid. His family, my grandparents, they\u2019re from the islands. That\u2019s what they call it. My dad, the only time he isn\u2019t so calm is if the whistler comes up.\n\nHe talks a little quicker then, eyes move faster, and he tells us not to think about it so much and to always remember the one rule, the Big Rule: don\u2019t try to look outside when the whistler goes past.\n\nNot that we could look even if we wanted. See, there are shutters on the inside of every window, thick pieces of heavy canvas that pull down from the top and latch to the bottom of the window frame. Each latch even has a small lock, about the size of what you\u2019d find on a diary. My dad locks those shutters every night before we all go to bed and keeps the key in his room.\n\nMy mom\u2026I don\u2019t know what she thinks about the whistling. I\u2019ve seen her out in the living room before at 3:03 when the sound starts; I could see her if I cracked my door open just an inch to peek. She\u2019s not out there often, at least I haven\u2019t caught her much, but once or twice a month I think she sits out there on our big red couch just listening.\n\nThe whistler has the same tune every night. It\u2019s\u2026cheerful.\n\n*Da da dada da dum. Da da dada da dum.*\n\nRemember how I said there are two odd things about where I live? Well, besides our night whistler, everyone in my neighborhood is really lucky. It\u2019s hard to explain and dad doesn\u2019t like us talking about this part much, either, but good things just seem to happen to people around here a lot. Usually, it\u2019s small things, winning a radio contest, or getting an unexpected promotion at work, or finding some arrowheads buried in the yard, you know, the authentic kind.\n\nThe weather is pretty good and there\u2019s no crime and everybody\u2019s gardens bloom extra bright in the fall. \u201cA million little blessings,\u201d I\u2019ve heard my mom say about living here. But the main reason we stay here, why we moved here in the first place, is my sister Nola. She was born very sick, something with her lungs. We couldn\u2019t even bring her home when she was born, only visit her in the hospital. She was so small, I remember, small even compared to the other babies. A machine had to breathe for her.\n\nWe moved into our house here to be closer to the hospital. As soon as we moved here, Nola starting getting better. The doctors couldn\u2019t figure it out, they chalked it up to whatever they were doing but we all could tell they were confused. But my parents knew, even I knew, Nola getting better was just another of the million little blessings we got for living in our neighborhood.\n\nSo that\u2019s why we stayed even after we found out that, for every small miracle that happens here every day, now and then\u2026some bad things happen. But they only happen if you look for the whistler.\n\nSee, our neighborhood has a Welcoming Committee. They show up with macaroni casserole and a gift basket and a manila folder whenever someone new moves in. They\u2019re very friendly. Four people showed up when we moved in seven years ago. The committee made small talk, gave me a Snickers bar, and took turns holding Nola. It was her first week out of the hospital so they were extra careful.\n\nThen the committee asked to speak to my parents in private so I was sent to my room where I still managed to hear nearly every word. The Welcoming Committee told my parents about how nice the neighborhood was, really exceptionally, hard-to-explain kind of nice. And then they told my parents about the even harder-to-explain whistling that happened every morning at 3:03 and ended at the tick of 3:05. The group, our new neighbors, warned my parents that the whistling was quiet, would never harm or hurt us, as long as we didn\u2019t look for what was making the sound.\n\nThis part they stressed and I pushed my ear into the door straining to hear them. People who went looking for the whistler had their luck change, sometimes tragically. A black cloud would hang over anyone that looked. Anything that could go wrong, would. The manila envelope the committee brought over contained newspaper clippings, stories about car crashes and ruined lives, public deaths and freak accidents.\n\n\u201cNot everyone dies,\u201d I heard the head of the committee tell my dad. \u201cBut the life goes out of \u2018em. Even if they live, there\u2019s no light in them ever again, no presence.\u201d\n\nMy mom, I could tell she wasn\u2019t taking it seriously. She kept asking if this was some prank they play on new neighbors. At one point my mom got angry, accused the committee of trying to scare us out of our new home, asked them if they were racist on account of my dad being from the islands. My dad calmed her down, told her he could tell our new neighbors were sincere and they were just trying to help us. He explained that he grew up hearing these kinds of stories from his mom and that he knew there were strange things that walked among us. Some of those strange things were good and some were bad but most were just different.\n\nAfter the committee left, dad went out to the hardware store, bought the canvas blinds, the latches, and the locks and installed them on every window in the house after dinner. That first night in our new house, I crept out of my room at 3 a.m. only to find my dad awake sitting on the living room couch, holding my baby sister. My dad held up his finger in a shh motion but patted the couch next to him. I sat and we waited.\n\nAt exactly 3:03 we heard the whistling.\n\n*Da da dada da dum. Da da dada da dum.*\n\nIt came and it went just like our neighbors said. The whistling returns each night and we never look and we enjoy our million little blessings every day. Nola breathes on her own and she\u2019s grown into a strong, clever girl. My dad even joined the Welcoming Committee. We don\u2019t get new neighbors often, why would anyone want to leave? But when a new family moves in, my dad and the committee bring them macaroni casserole, a gift basket, and the manila folder. I can always tell by the look on my dad\u2019s face when he comes back if the family took the committee seriously or if we\u2019d be getting new neighbors again very soon.\n\nNot long ago a family moved in directly next to us. The previous owner, Ms. Maddie, passed away at age 105. She\u2019d lived a good, long life. Our new neighbors seemed like they\u2019d fit in just fine. They believed the Welcoming Committee, took my dad\u2019s advice about the locking shutters since they had a young child of their own. Whatever newspaper clippings were in that manila envelope, whatever evidence, my dad never let us see. But I imagine it must have been awfully convincing since our neighbors got along with no issues for the first month.\n\nOne night, when our new neighbors had to leave town, they sent their son, Holden, to stay with us. He was 12, a year under me in school. I didn\u2019t know him well before that night but as soon as his parents dropped him off after dinner I could tell it was going to be a bad time.\n\n\u201cDo you know who is always out there whistling every night?\u201d Holden asked the moment the adults left the room.\n\nThe three of us were sitting in the den, some Disney movie playing idly on the television.\n\nMy sister and I exchanged a glance. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about that,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s that weirdo that lives in the big yellow house on the corner,\u201d Holden said.\n\n\u201cMr. Toles?\u201d my sister asked. \u201cNo way, he\u2019s really nice.\u201d\n\nHolden shrugged. \u201cMust be a psycho killer, then.\u201d\n\nNola tensed.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about it,\u201d I repeated. \u201cLet\u2019s go in my room and play Nintendo.\u201d\n\nWe spent the next few hours playing games, eating popcorn and then watching movies. A typical sleepover but I could see Holden was getting antsy.\n\nAfter my parents had wished us a good night, locked the blinds, and gone to bed, Holden stood up from his bean bag and walked over to where Nola and I were sitting on my bed.\n\n\u201cHave you ever even tried looking?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly time.\u201d\n\nLike most sleepovers, we\u2019d conveniently ignored any suggestion of a bedtime. I was shocked to see he was right; it was almost 3 a.m.\n\nI sighed. \u201cWe don\u2019t-\u201d\n\n\u201cSee, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t even try to look because my dad locks the blinds every night and hides the key,\u201d he continued, ignoring me.\n\n\u201cSo does our dad,\u201d said Nola.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied Holden. \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou saw him do it,\u201d I said, a little sharper than I meant to sound.\n\nHolden grinned. \u201cYour dad locks the blinds, yeah, but he doesn\u2019t hide the key. He keeps it right on his normal key chain.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d I asked, worried I already knew what he would say next. Because I had noticed that my dad didn\u2019t bother hiding the key anymore after all of these years. Because he knew we took it seriously.\n\n\u201cSo, after your dad locked up but before your parents went to bed, I went to the bathroom. And on my way, I may have peeked into their room, and I may have seen your dad\u2019s key chain on his nightstand, and I maybe went and borrowed the key to blinds.\u201d\n\nNola and I stared and his grin only grew wider.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d I said.\n\nHolden shrugged. \u201cYou can check if you want. Just open your parents\u2019 door and look, you\u2019ll see his keychain right there on the nightstand.\u201d\n\n\u201cStay here,\u201d I told both of them. \u201cDon\u2019t move a muscle.\u201d\n\nI hurried over to my parents\u2019 room but hesitated at the door. If Holden wasn\u2019t lying\u2026my dad would be angry. Beyond angry. I was scared thinking about it. But more scared of an open window with the whistler right outside. I opened the door, barely an inch, and looked in but it was too dark to see. Taking a deep breath, I walked into the room.\n\nTwo steps into the dark I froze. The whistling started. And I could hear it clearly\u2026from my parents\u2019 room. I never realized but they must have heard the sound every night since we moved into the house. They never told us. I don\u2019t think I could have slept through it.\n\nI stood there, listening to the whistling come closer, unsure whether I should turn on a light or call out for my dad. Soft sounds from the living room brought me back to reality.\n\n\u201cNola,\u201d I yelled, running out of my parents\u2019 room.\n\nHolden and Nola were standing near the front door next to a window. Holden wasn\u2019t lying. I could see him fumbling with the lock on one of the blinds. I heard a click. He did have the key.\n\nHolden let out a quick laugh. Nola stood next to him, hunched up, afraid but maybe curious. The whistling was right outside our house now.\n\nI think I made a sound, called out. I can\u2019t remember. Time felt frozen, clock hands nailed to the face. But I found myself moving. I\u2019m not fast, I\u2019ve never been athletic. Somehow, though, I covered the space between myself and Nola in a moment. My eyes were locked on her but I heard Holden pull the blind all the way down so it could release. I heard the snap of it start to raise, and I heard the whistling just on the other side of the window.\n\nBut I had my arms around Nola and I turned us so she was facing away from the window. At the same time, I jammed my eyes shut.  The blind whipped open.\n\nThe whistling stopped.\n\nI felt Nola shaking in my arms.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look, okay?\u201d I told her. \u201cDon\u2019t turn around.\u201d\n\nWe were positioned so that she was facing back towards the hallway and I was facing the window. My eyes were still closed. I felt her nod into my shoulder.\n\nI reached out with the arm not holding Nola and tried to touch Holden. My hand brushed against his arm. He was shaking worse than Nola.\n\n\u201cHolden?\u201d I asked.\n\nSilence.\n\nI reached past him and gingerly felt for the window, eyes still sealed shut. The glass was cold against my fingertips. Colder than it should have been for the time of year. I moved my hand up the window, searching for the string to the blind. The glass began to get warmer the further I reached and there was a gentle hum feeding back into my fingertips. I tried not to think about what might be on the other side of the window. Finally, I touched the string and yanked the blinds shut.\n\nI opened my eyes. In the dim light leaking out from the kitchen, I could make out Holden, pale and small, staring at the now closed window.\n\n\u201cHolden?\u201d I asked again.\n\nHe turned towards me and he *screamed.*\n\nEverything became a flurry of motion. Lights sparked to life in the hall, then the living room. My parents\u2019 footsteps thudded across the hardwood floor. I didn\u2019t turn to look back at them, my eyes were glued to Holden.\n\nHe was pale, had bit his lip so hard there was a thin red line of blood running down his chin and he\u2019d wet himself.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d my dad asked from behind me.\n\nI managed to swivel away from Holden and look back. \u201cHe looked.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d never seen my dad scared before but I saw it that night, in that moment, an old, ugly terror stitched on his face. A parent\u2019s fear.\n\n\u201cJust Holden?\u201d he mouthed to me.\n\nI nodded yes.\n\nMy dad let out a breath. He looked so relieved I nearly expected him to cheer. But then he turned to Holden and my dad\u2019s face changed. I wondered if he felt bad for feeling good that Holden was the only one that looked.\n\nThere was a knock at the door.\n\nWe all froze. Holden whimpered.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t answer it,\u201d my mom said.\n\nShe stood at the threshold of the hall. I\u2019d always thought she was a skeptic and just humored my dad about the windows and the whistler but that night we were all believers. I noticed that both of my parents held baseball bats they must have taken from their bedroom.\n\nThe knock came again, a little louder this time.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t open the door,\u201d Holden whispered.\n\nMy dad walked over to him, hugged him close.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t,\u201d my dad promised, still holding his bat. \u201cNothing is coming in here tonight.\u201d\n\nThud thud thud\n\nThis time the knocking was loud enough to rattle the door. Holden screamed again and Nola clutched her arms around my neck. My mom came over and knelt down next to us, wrapping my sister and me close.\n\n**Thud thud thud**\n\n\u201cCall the police,\u201d my mom whispered to my dad.\n\nThe knocking instantly stopped. My dad looked over his shoulder at us.\n\n\u201cDo you think-\u201d\n\nHe was cut off by frantic knocking that trailed off to a polite tap tap tap.\n\n\u201c*Police*,\u201d something said from the other side of the door.\n\nThe voice from outside sounded exactly like my mom, like a parrot repeating the words back to her.\n\n\u201c*Police*. *Call*. *The police*.\u201d **tap tap tap** \u201c*Police*.\u201d\n\nMy mom pulled us closer.\n\n\u201c*Police*. *Police*. *Police*. *Police*.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease stop,\u201d I heard her whisper.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think calling them will help,\u201d my dad said. \u201cHow will we know when they\u2019re the ones at the door?\u201d\n\nThe knocking came back harder than before. The door shook. Then it stopped. After a long moment, I heard the knocking again but it was coming from our backdoor.\n\nWe all turned together towards the backdoor but the knocking immediately returned to the front door. Front to back, back to front, loud then quiet then loud again. Suddenly, the sound was coming from both doors at once, big, heavy blows like a sledgehammer. Then something started rapping against all of the windows in the house, then the walls. It was like we were living inside a drum with a dozen people trying to play at once. Or we were a turtle and something was attempting to claw us out of our shell.\n\n\u201cSTOP!\u201d Holden yelled.\n\nThe knocking died.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t tell,\u201d Holden said, staring at the door. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t tell anyone what I saw. Just please go away.\u201d\n\nWe waited for nearly a minute. Then we heard it, a soft *tap tap tap* coming from the window Holden had looked through earlier.\n\nHolden started to cry, sobbing like a prisoner watching gallows being built outside their cell.\n\nMy dad held him, brushed his hair but never lied to him, never told him things would be okay.\n\nThe tapping at the window went on for the rest of the night. We huddled together in the living room for I don\u2019t know how long. Eventually, my mom tried to take us kids into my room while my dad stayed to watch the door. But the second we moved into my bedroom the knocking came back, so loud it was possible to ignore. I was afraid the door couldn\u2019t take it.\n\nWe went back to the living room and the knocking stopped. Only the tap tap tap on the window remained. None of us slept that night.\n\nThe tapping stopped around 7 a.m. That\u2019s about the time the sun comes up here. We waited another two hours before my dad opened the blinds from one window. He made us all go back to my parents\u2019 bedroom first. I heard him open the door then come back in.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he told us. \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nHolden\u2019s parents came back around lunchtime. My mom and dad walked Holden over to his house and they all went inside for quite a while. Nola and I watched from the window. She stuck to me the whole day, right at my side, sometimes holding my hand. When my parents came back they looked grim but wouldn\u2019t tell us what they said to Holden\u2019s family. It was a Sunday so we all spent the day together, ordered pizza and watched movies.\n\nThat night everyone slept in my room, Nola and my mom in the bed with me, my dad in a chair he\u2019d pulled over. There was no knocking that night or any night since.\n\nWe didn\u2019t see much of Holden or his parents for the rest of that week but by Thursday there was a moving truck in their driveway. Nola and I watched them packing up the whole afternoon after school. What sticks with me most is how tired Holden and his parents looked. All three had the same pallor, grim mouths and light-less eyes. Even from across the street I could tell something was very wrong. Holden and his family were gone before sunset.\n\nI remember what the original Welcoming Committee said to my parents when we moved in. Not everyone who looks at the whistler dies, but even those that live have the light go out of them and the rest of their lives are full of misfortune. A million little tragedies.\n\nI think Holden\u2019s parents must have looked, either to comfort him if they didn\u2019t believe or share the burden if they did. I watch Nola some days, happy and young and alive, and I wonder if I\u2019d been slower, if she\u2019d looked out the window that night\u2026would I have looked too? To comfort her? To share that burden? I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to find out.\n\nWe still live in that house, in that neighborhood. We still hear our whistler walking past every night. The blessings, the luck, the good things here are too good to leave. But we\u2019re careful. We don\u2019t have friends over to spend the night anymore. And my dad hides the key to the blinds very, very well. Not that I\u2019ve gone looking. Some things you just don\u2019t need to look for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[GTM](https://www.reddit.com/r/Grand_Theft_Motto/comments/emzy3b/the_stories/)\n\n[Hello](https://travisbrownwriting.com)",

At 4am, on the dot. I could hear it start from my living room window (sometimes I sleep on the couch because it's where the AC can blast me in the face lol) and it would continue past my sister's room, and then past my room... And then a little ways further it would stop. \n\nWhat's interesting about it is that it seemed to start and stop out of nowhere. I imagine if it was someone on their commute to work, I would hear them rolling along before they reached our house (we live on a sort of cul de sac) and then continue on rolling along long after they passed our house, since the bus stop is a good 5 minutes away on foot. But it always seemed to start right outside our living room window and stop just a little farther from my bedroom window. \n\nAnd one day it just stopped. I never did find out who (or maybe *what*) it was because I was too spooked to look out the window to see, lol. Freaky!",

                            "comment": "So, this happened in mid 2017. I was pretty much an insomniac back then. I stayed up reading stories on the phone till 3 or 4 every night. I used keep the lights off because my mum used to sleep in the same room as me. Now, my room is the farthest from the street in front. And beside my window there's a huge pond. So, my room was kinda isolated.\n\nOne night i was up as usual reading when i thought i heard a sound. A drawn out loud voice kind of. It was very mild. Thinking that i was just thinking too much after reading the stories i ignored it. After some time though, the sound started to grow louder. I began to think whether something had jumped in behind my room. Knowing how hard it is to get to my room from the outside i was even more spooked out. The sound seemed like it was a little girl screaming and wailing in a really eerie manner. Slowly though the sound started to grow dimmer until it became absolutely silent. At this point the whole situation hit me. As i tried to make sense of it with the stories that i had read fatigue came upon me and I fell asleep.\n\nThe next night i had completely forgotten about it and was reading stories as usual. I had brushed off the whole thing as a one time occurance. But then it happened. Once again right at 1 o'clock the sound came. This time i felt that my mum was awake too. But none of us said anything to the other. We both laid their like planks holding our breaths in waiting for the soumd to end. Soon the sound grew more silent and our breaths became regular. I broke the silence and asked her whether she knows what's happening. She just told me it's nothing and told me to go to sleep. But i knew she was just saying that to calm me down and inside she was just as frightened as me, if not more. Somehow we fell asleep that night.\n\nEverynight the sound came and went. At the same time. And sometimes at 4 in the morning too. Nobody spoke about this when morning came. With each night the sound was making me more excited. I felt as if it was my little neighbourhood paranormal story. Like in the stories i read. Some nights after the sound had gone i even suggested my mum that she let me peek at the thing making the sound. Each time she just told me to go to sleep.\n\nAfter some more days when the sound had already become a part of our daily curriculum my mum came to my room excited, saying that she has some \ud835\udcf7\ud835\udcf2\ud835\udcec\ud835\udcee news. Turns out one of the older kids in our neighborhood had stayed up and peeked at the thing. The thing was a middle aged man wearing completely grey clothes on a cycle with a whistle. That whistle was the cause of all of this silent mental mayhem. It was the new watchman. Nobody had hired this dude. He just appeared one day and started watching over our neighborhood. Once a month he came around to all our houses for money. We gave him some and pleaded him to change his whistle. He didn't. I guess he just likes to fuck with us.\n\nAfter that I had to stay up some nights studying for my exam and I had seen the dude going by the road around the pond. Now, almost 2 years later the sound still happens but now instead of being scared i have found a sense of familiarity. The sound is now a reminder that it's 1 o'clock again. \n\nI hope this helps you sleep again. \u263b\n\nThe sound https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r3VNeE2ELynYZIWwnYQznWXX0KYJaauI/view?usp=drivesdk\n\nEdit: the last bit of the recording is empty. He went away but i didn't realise it so...",

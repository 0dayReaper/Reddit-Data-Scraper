    "postText": "Since my wife died last year, I\u2019ve been travelling across the UK in a decked-out van with my son, Sam. We\u2019ve been heading up to Inverness, his mother\u2019s favourite place, in the hope of scattering her ashes. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that I\u2019m a lover of adventures, is it?\n\n***Journey to the Lake***  \n*Choose Your End*\n\nI picked it up from a charity store yesterday. A hardback novel with a tattered paper cover. Whilst some knock-offs are a little cringe-worthy, I was intrigued by this one. Minuscule white writing on an all-black cover. The stark, sinister minimalism of the art really gripped me.\n\nPlus, I have fond memories of the \u201cChoose Your Own Adventure\u201d books from Sam\u2019s childhood. But \u201cJourney to the Lake\u201d seemed a little more mature than the stories I remembered.\n\n*Choose Your End*\n\nThe title alone seemed bleak, but I didn\u2019t know the half of it.\n\n\u201cYou reach a crossroads\u2026 Uh oh,\u201d Sam said, chuckling as he read the book aloud.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, smiling.\n\n\u201cTime to make our first decision,\u201d He replied.\n\n\u201cLeave this to me,\u201d I said, cracking my neck decisively.\n\nSam groaned. \u201cDad, no. You always made the worst decisions with these books back in the day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cMum was always the smart one. I was the beauty, and she was the brains.\u201d\n\nSam shook his head, before clearing his throat and leaning into the light above the van\u2019s front dashboard. He read with the giddiness of a child. Of course, even at the age of 19, he\u2019s still a child to me.\n\n\u201cPick the safest path to the lake,\u201d Sam read. \u201cTake the road to Yellow Town. Page 11. Or take the road to Brickrock. Page 43.\u201d\n\n\u201cYellow Town!\u201d I exuberantly requested.\n\nSam, being a people-pleasing saint, rolled his eyes and obliged. He flicked through the pages of the dusty, unbranded book and settled on Page 11.\n\nTo summarise, the road took our character to Yellow Town, a seemingly-serene place with a sinister history. It was haunted by the Seafarer, a stranger who was hanged for slaughtering seven townsfolk. And his ghost, donning a black raincoat, stalked the protagonist.\n\n\u201cOh, so it\u2019s *that* kind of story,\u201d I said, smiling.\n\n\u201cI thought we would be going on a fantastical adventure with dragons and fairies,\u201d Sam gulped.\n\n\u201cMaybe the Seafarer has a magical boat?\u201d I suggested, smirking.\n\n\u201cOkay\u2026 I\u2019m gonna stop there. I\u2019m tired,\u201d Sam said.\n\n\u201cOr scared?\u201d I teased. \u201cWell, if you want to stop reading so early, I might as well carry on driving to Carlisle. You okay with that? We could treat ourselves to a hotel, rather than kipping in the van.\u201d\n\nSam shrugged. \u201cSure. Just wake me in a couple of hours.\u201d\n\nBut I woke him far earlier than that. You see, we never made it to Carlisle.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Joune...?\u201d I whispered, squinting to read the road sign for a town I hadn\u2019t seen on the GPS.\n\nThe sign might\u2019ve said something else, but it was dark, and one of the letters had faded.\n\nI was more concerned with the neat rows of structures that rushed towards us on either side of the road. Quaint cottages, shops, and other quintessential British buildings \u2014 but they were all various shades of yellow. Like the town in the book. A strange coincidence.\n\nBut then, in one of the house\u2019s upper windows, I briefly saw something which glued the flesh of my hands to the steering wheel.\n\nA man in a black raincoat. Watching.\n\n***Journey to the Lake*** was on my brain, so it had to be confirmation bias. That was what I told myself.\n\nSam laughed when I woke him and explained the situation. He said the tables had turned \u2014 suddenly, I was the scaredy-pants. I thought he might be right.\n\n\u201cRoom for two?\u201d Asked the hotel receptionist at a little B&amp;B in the middle of the town.\n\n\u201cYes, please,\u201d I said. \u201cTwo singles, mind.\u201d\n\nSam rolled his eyes \u2014 his favourite response to my humorous quips. The receptionist merely nodded and handed over a key.\n\n\u201cRoom 11. The end,\u201d She said.\n\n\u201cBeg your pardon?\u201d I asked in a hoarse whisper, suddenly perturbed by the receptionist\u2019s uneven tone of voice.\n\n\u201cThe end of the corridor,\u201d She clarified, offering a false smile. \u201cYou can\u2019t miss it.\u201d\n\nSam and I practically sleep-walked to our room in the early hours of the morning, but I was overcome by a strange sense of alertness when I plopped onto my bed. I wish I hadn\u2019t remedied that with the following idea.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna read a little more,\u201d I said, pulling the book out of my backpack.\n\nSam groaned. \u201cWhy did you bring that in here?\u201d\n\nI found myself unable to crack one of my usual jokes. \u201cI just have to know what happens next.\u201d\n\n*Weary from your travels, you graciously accept the keys from the innkeeper.*  \n*\u201cRoom 11. The end,\u201d She says.*\n\nHow? How could the book have known? Heart gripped by the terrifying and inexplicable sensation of suddenly being watched, I stopped reading.\n\n\u201cHa, ha,\u201d Sam sarcastically grumbled. \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cRead it for yourself,\u201d I shuddered, hurling the book at him.\n\nMy son sat up and read the page for himself. \u201cIs this one of your jokes? First, the yellow buildings. Now, a scripted conversation?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were there in the shop with me. I found the book. I didn\u2019t write it,\u201d I said. \u201cI think we need to go.\u201d\n\nA booming sound echoed along the hotel corridor, and goosebumps bubbled across my icy flesh. I\u2019d never been so frightened in my life, but I summoned the bravery to stumble over to the door.\n\n\u201cYou hear a thunderous creak in the hallway,\u201d Sam read. \u201cGazing through the peephole, you see\u2026\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t need my son to finish the sentence \u2014 yet again, the book had predetermined my actions. And through the peephole of the hotel door, I saw something horrifying.\n\nThe man in the black raincoat stood in the hallway, one eye peering into the peephole from the other side \u2014 as if he could see me. He was warped by the curvature of the glass into a horrifically large, malformed man. Or maybe those were his true dimensions. And there was no accounting for his lifeless, sagging skin. That was surely no trickery of the glass.\n\nI screamed, stumbling backwards from the door.\n\n\u201cHead into the hallway. Page 59. Exit through the window. Page 115. Dad, what is this?\u201d Sam quivered, seemingly understanding, at long last, that I was not playing a cruel joke.\n\n\u201cPage 115, right?\u201d I asked, turning and running over to the window.\n\nSam nodded, leaping to his feet and frantically flipping through the pages as I pulled the curtains open. Fortunately, we were on the ground floor, and the window opened wide enough for us to slip out.\n\nSam went first, taking our bags with him, but I struggled to squeeze my slightly larger form through the window.\n\n\u201cDad!\u201d Sam screeched.\n\nAnd in the reflection of the glass pane, I saw him. Standing behind me.\n\nThe Seafarer.\n\nThe door hadn\u2019t opened. I don\u2019t know how he entered the room. I don\u2019t know how any of it happened.\n\nOne of his cold hands clamped onto my shoulder, squeezing tightly enough to drain the very life out of my being \u2014 his touch filled me with a haunting hollowness that I cannot put into words. An eternal hell that must\u2019ve only lasted a moment in reality.\n\nTerrified, I wrenched my body free of the inhuman man\u2019s grasp, and I slithered out of the window after my son.\n\nWe sprinted to the van and made a hasty getaway, grateful to have chosen the right path this time. Or so we thought. As I drove the way we came, something unexplainable happened.\n\nWe found ourselves back in Yellow Town.\n\nNo matter which way we drove, the road always led back to Yellow Town. And that\u2019s when the horrifying gravity of events soon dawned on both of us. We were trapped.\n\nWe *are* trapped.\n\nOnly the book can determine our fate. We\u2019re too frightened to go back to an earlier point in the book and change things, given that we don\u2019t know how this unholy scripture works \u2014 all we know is that this isn\u2019t a story. Every consequence is real.\n\nOur next choice is as follows:\n\n*You take the off-road route through the forest. But which road will bring you to the lake in time?*\n\n*Route 15 \u2014 Page 152*  \n*Route 11 \u2014 Page 191*\n\nI have no idea which route to take, but I trust Sam\u2019s judgement more than my own. I hope to update all of you soon.\n\nIf you never see a post from me again, then I guess we\u2019ve chosen the wrong path.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

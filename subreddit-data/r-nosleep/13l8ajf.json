If you are, the best case scenario is that you miss a pay check, the worst, you get caught. And if you get caught, no one is coming to help you.\n\nI\u2019ve been doing it for a few years now, so I\u2019ve got my strategy down. I\u2019m fairly frail looking so all I have to do is fake a limp and people don\u2019t think twice about \u2018helping\u2019 me. It\u2019s laughably easy to lure bleeding hearts to a secluded area so I can slit their throats and open them up.\n\nThe target I had staked out that day was mousy stick of a man. He obviously spent more time at the computer than at the gym. He didn\u2019t seem like the type to carry, but I was always careful to look a person over for signs of a concealed carry.\n\nHe stuttered when I approached him, practically shaking like a new born deer, but he was happy to help. He didn\u2019t even bother to try to keep me in his glasses bound sights.\n\nIt made it all the easier to strike him down.\n\nI want to say that I knew something was wrong, that even the tiniest bit a dread creeped down my spine, but I had no idea how bad of an idea it was to choose this guy.\n\nI did my usual harvesting routine, packing the now free organs in a stashed cooler.\n\nI space out my harvests and cycle locations to err on the side of caution, so I was miles away from where I killed him when I saw him again.\n\nI have a pretty good poker face, but it almost shattered when I spotted him no worse for wear, humming to himself while talking a walk.\n\nIt was impossible. He couldn\u2019t have survived; much less be in the condition to walk around. It had to be some weird look alike!\n\nStill, I hated loose ends.\n\nHe acted just like last time, though he seemed to pick up on my distress. \u201cA-are you o-okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m okay, just a bit stressed... Hey, random question but do you have a twin?\u201d\n\nHe blinked owlishly at that. \u201cNo... I-I'm an only child.\u201d\n\nEven with how suspicious I must have been acting, killing him was just as easy as last time. Panting, I watched him spasm and choke as he hemorrhaged from the cut on his throat before he stilled.\n\nMaybe it was just my nerves, but the following silence felt deafening. Instinct told me to run but I needed to at least harvest one organ today.\n\nI nudged him with my foot, half expecting him to jolt up and bite at my throat like a zombie from a horror movie.\n\nNothing.\n\nStill my heart would not slow.\n\nI took more from him than I did last time but my cuts were much shakier.\n\nI rested an extra few days after that and I was still shaken when I went out again.\n\nOf course, he was there again.\u00a0\n\nInstinct screamed at me to leave, to abandon what felt like a sinking ship, but I feared what would happen if I didn\u2019t kill him more than if I did.\n\nMy composure was better, but I still felt I was drawing more attention than was healthy for my career.\n\nAgain, there wasn\u2019t a slightest bit of difference in how he acted.\n\nI killed him again. One slice and he was down.\n\nThe world spun. How many times would I have to keep doing this?\n\nIn a daze, I turned around and began to walk away.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re missing a couple of steps.\u201d\n\nThat voice, smooth and barely recognizable, froze me solid.\n\nI couldn\u2019t breathe as I looked back.\n\nHe stared back at me, a completely neutral expression on his face, unbothered by the gouge in his throat.\n\nBut that neutrality quickly faded into thinly veiled irk. \u201cI let you rip out my guts two times, the least you can give me is a decent reaction.\u201d\n\nIn an adjacent situation, that would have been moment guys with cameras would burst out of the woodwork and yell \u201c*you just got pranked bro*!\u201d but no one jumped out of the shadows. It was just me and what should have been a corpse.\n\nI finally managed to choke out a pathetic \u201c*how*?\u201d\n\nHe snorted. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been *remotely* entertaining enough for me to *entertain* answering that.\u201d\n\nI took a step back. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cLooks like you haven\u2019t been harvesting enough brains.\u201d He shifted so he was laying on his side, throat still open and oozing. \u201cWhy else wouldn\u2019t I have struck you down the second I found you slicing a woman\u2019s throat? You\u2019re entertainment. Though lousy in that front.\u201d\n\nIce cold terror and red-hot fiery rage battled in my bloodstream, the urge to run away fighting the urge to stomp his brains in.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky, really, to have run into me and not someone else. My moral backbone is quite bendable, especially when I\u2019m bored. But,\u201d He tapped his fingers on the bloody concrete, \u201cYou really weren\u2019t worth keeping alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201d I said reflexively, trying to repress my shaking.\n\nHe raised an eyebrow. \u201cAnd how do you plan on doing that?\u201d\n\nMy mouth opened but I couldn\u2019t squeeze anything out.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d He rose to his feet like he was wire-flying in a play, completely unnatural. \u201cNow, I believe it\u2019s time to discuss repayment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nIf this had been some sort of game or film, his eyes would have glowed, but instead those dark orbs seemed to swallow light like a black hole. \u201cFor every organ you stole, of course. Every inch of skin flayed, every drop of blood spilled.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can give you money!\u201d I sputtered. \u201cA lot of money! All the money!\u201d\n\nHe blinked slow and sure, like a lazy predator who knew its prey could not escape. \u201cDoes it look like I have any interest in money?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when I finally succumbed to the instinct to run. I darted out of the alleyway.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what should have happened, but as if I made a full circle, when I rounded the corner I was back in the alley with him staring blankly at me.\n\nHe clicked his tongue. \u201cIt\u2019s far too late to back out now, especially since you\u2019ve accumulated so much debt.\u201d\n\nI had to get out of here, out of this *thing*\u2019s clutches. I looked down at my knife.\n\n\u201c*Like I said*.\u201d He was suddenly way too close, a hand trapping the wrist of my knife hand. \u201cIt\u2019s far *too late* to back out.\u201d\n\nMy fist shattered on impact with his impossibly hard chin. He didn\u2019t even flinch as I screamed in agony.\n\n\u201cOh my, throwing a tantrum? The only person to blame is yourself.\u201d\n\nI continued to struggle against his grip, but I could not even make him so much as wiggle.\n\n\u201cHow sad. And how *annoying*\\-\u201d\n\nI suddenly couldn\u2019t move, like the air around me had become stone.\n\nHis eyes in which nothing escaped bore into mine. \u201cLet\u2019s tally up your debt, shall we? Two hearts, two livers, four lungs, four kidneys, one stomach, thirty-six broken ribs, one-hundred ninety-one square inches of flayed skin and muscle, and 13 liters of split blood.\u201d He tsked. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a lot. And that is not including severed nerves.\u201d\n\nI choked, trying to say something, anything.\n\n\u201cEven if we broke it down to a matter of simply cells, you don\u2019t have enough in your body currently to repay me. *So,*\u201d He drew out that syllable. \u201cIf I were to harvest a pint of blood every 12 weeks, you would have 7 years before your final payment is required.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d his bored expression broke into a sinister grin. \u201cLet\u2019s make the first payment, shall we?\u201d\n\nHis free hand crept up to the forearm he held captive. I renewed my efforts to escape as he dragged a nail across my skin, though I still couldn\u2019t move not matter how hard I tried.\n\nHis finger stilled on a vein and I felt a sharp sting, like a needle had grown out his fingertip.\n\nAfter what felt like forever, he removed his finger, revealing an oozing wound.\n\n\u201cThere. That wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\u201d His grip, both physical and supernatural, released me.\u00a0\n\nI scrambled back, but what distance I gained didn\u2019t feel remotely enough.\n\n\u201cWhelp.\u201d He made a show of dusting off his bloody clothes. \u201cI\u2019ll be seeing you. Oh, and try to cut your life short and you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d\n\nWith that, he turned and walked out of the alley, whistling an unfamiliar tune like he didn\u2019t have a care in the world.",

    "postText": "**September 8th, 2017**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really didn\u2019t see my Friday night going this fucking badly. I *should* be in Portland right now with Samantha right now, but instead I\u2019m stuck here on a greyhound bus, waiting for the goddamn driver to come back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeast I\u2019ve got my laptop, I guess. But no internet, go fucking figure, so I\u2019ve got nothing to do but ramble to myself like a goddamn lunatic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s been about 45 minutes by now, I would\u2019ve thought the driver would\u2019ve at least come back with an update or something, but apparently not. Maybe he\u2019s still on the phone with someone out there? I can see his flashlight out front so he\u2019s *got* to still still out there!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe kid in the seat behind me woke up and he\u2019s crying. I can hear his Mom trying to shush him, but he\u2019s screaming so loud that you can barely even hear her. One of the two old ladies a few seats in front of me got up to coo at him and see if she could help the Mom settle him down, but she doesn\u2019t seem to be having any luck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other old lady just looks annoyed, but she hasn\u2019t said anything yet. Funnily enough, she kinda reminds me of my Mom\u2026 and not in a good way. Round face, curly hair, flushed red cheeks and little piggy eyes. I\u2019m half expecting her to get up and start swearing at the kid, just like my Mom always did with my little brother whenever she got drunk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSee - it\u2019s *that* kind of behavior that made my Dad divorce her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt least the other old lady is nice. I can hear her trying to make small talk with the Mom. I *think* the kid might be starting to calm down, but I don\u2019t know. I just heard the old lady (the one who doesn\u2019t look like my Mom) say: \u201cLife is a bus ride, isn\u2019t it! It takes you to all kinds of exciting places and you meet all sorts of exciting people!\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs that supposed to be a joke?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeems kinda lame.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe guy in the suit near the front of the bus is still asleep. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s figured out that we\u2019ve broken down yet. Maybe he\u2019ll sleep through this whole ordeal. Christ, we should all be so fucking lucky. Looks like the Mom is getting up to talk to the bus driver. Fucking finally. I\u2019ve been waiting for someone else to do it. I don\u2019t really want to do it myself since I\u2019m all pissed off right now and I don\u2019t really want to be the assh\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Okay what the fuck?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Mom just fucking told us that the bus driver is *gone!* As in, he\u2019s straight up not here anymore! His flashlight is just sitting in the fucking road!I even went out there with her to go looking for him! We woke up the businessman (his name is Roberto) to look with us!\n\n*The driver is gone.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat the fuck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ve been talking with the other people on the bus. None of us have a phone signal right now, or else we\u2019d call for help. None of us have seen any cars passing by either, which now that I\u2019m thinking about it, is kinda weird. I mean, we were supposed to be on the highway this whole time, right? The road we\u2019re on kinda looks like a highway, but there should be people here! There should be other cars! Fuck, what the hell is going on here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ve got this stupid feeling in the back of my mind that I should be worried\u2026 but I mean, obviously, this is just some kind of screw up, right? It\u2019s like 3 AM. Obviously, there just aren\u2019t any cars around. Obviously, someone is going to come and find us. Obviously this is all going to work out!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut in the back of my mind, I can\u2019t help but wonder what\u2019s gonna happen if it doesn\u2019t.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJeez, I can\u2019t stop looking at the highway. Something about it is just so unsettling. It\u2019s like this liminal space where I know there *should* be people, but there aren\u2019t. This familiar space that\u2019s now weirdly empty. Which probably isn\u2019t *that* weird considering that it\u2019s 3 AM, right? I don\u2019t know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWriting this out on my laptop is the only thing keeping me from freaking out right now. I just need something to keep my mind focused for the time being. The Mom (her name is Karla) and Roberto are still trying to get a signal. Same with one of the little old ladies (the one who looks like my Mom.) I\u2019ve got my phone out just in case I can catch a signal but the battery is pretty low. My laptops got power, at least.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the old ladies (the one who doesn\u2019t look like my Mom, I think her name is Minnie), said she saw someone out on the road a little while ago. I\u2019m hoping that maybe it\u2019s the bus driver? Maybe he came back for us? Can\u2019t promise that I won\u2019t kick his fucking ass if that\u2019s the case\u2026 Karla\u2019s saying that she just saw somebody too. I\u2019m gonna go with her to look.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**September 9th, 2017**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I knew something was fucking wrong here, I fucking knew it! I fucking knew it!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Jesus fucking Christ!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe left the bus. It\u2019s not fucking safe there anymore. We\u2019ve moved to an abandoned gas station. We might be safe here? We\u2019ve barricaded the doors with whatever we could find, and God only fucking knows if it\u2019s gonna be enough!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the old ladies, Minnie, she didn\u2019t make it last night. When that *thing* attacked the bus, she couldn\u2019t get away in time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJesus\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne minute, I was out there with Karla, thinking that our driver had come back from God knows where, and the next everyone was screaming and we were trying to run and it\u2019s all just a goddamn blur and I\u2019m still struggling to piece it all together. I went out with Karla to see if the bus driver had come back. She said she\u2019d seen someone outside, so we went to look and it didn\u2019t take that long to find whoever\u2026 *whatever* it was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019d heard something under the bus, so I\u2019d gotten down to take a look. I\u2019d used Karla\u2019s phone as a flashlight to see, and I\u2019d been greeted with this face staring back at me. At first I\u2019d thought it was a guy, some junkie strung out on drugs. They were pale and way too skinny with bulging eyes, messy hair and this sort of gaping mouth. I was pretty freaked out by the sight of them, obviously but I still *thought* it was just a person!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought it was a person right up until they started clawing at me from under the bus. They started screaming, howling like some kind of wild animal, violently pulling themselves from out under the bus to try and get to me. Its limbs seemed a little too long, its nails looked a little too sharp. There was so much about it that just seemed *wrong* somehow, like it wasn\u2019t fully human, not really.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKarla and I had started running. We\u2019d gotten back on the bus, thinking that we\u2019d be safe there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe weren\u2019t.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoon as we closed the doors in that things face, it started trying to smash its way through them. It damn near tore the door off the fucking hinges.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe knew it was just a matter of time before it got inside, so we tried to get out. Roberto helped us smash one of the rear windows. We let Karla and her son (Aaron), out first, and tried to let the old ladies go second.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCharlene, (the one who looks like my Mom) got out first, but by then that thing had already gotten through the door. Minnie had been right behind us when it made it through\u2026 and when it charged at us, it got to her first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGod\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI watched her try to fight it off but\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt had already basically torn her apart before Roberto or I could even think about getting it off of her. She was screaming, crying, covered in blood. Not dead, but close to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe couldn\u2019t save her. We knew that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we ran. I went out the window first, and Roberto went second. We ran from the bus as fast as we could, following Karla and Charlene into the darkness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen at some point, we found the gas station.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe spent the night shoring it up, thinking we\u2019d only be waiting for a few hours until morning. But morning didn\u2019t come. The sky stayed pitch black.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven when the clock told us that it was one in the afternoon, the sky was still dark and there was still nobody out there. Nobody human, anyways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ll see them sometimes when I\u2019m on watch. Usually they\u2019re across the street, and I\u2019m never sure if they notice us or not. They\u2019re hard to see in the dark. But they\u2019re out there. They usually don\u2019t get too close to the gas station, usually. The few who did, we\u2019ve been able to scare off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey don\u2019t move like people. They walk on all fours, loping like animals. Sometimes I can hear them howling at each other. Those howls don\u2019t sound human.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe food in the gas station is pretty stale. Some of it\u2019s so rotten that it\u2019s literally inedible. Roberto and I agreed to try heading back to the bus a few hours ago to see what supplies we could get\u2026 it\u2019s how I got my laptop back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMinnie\u2019s body was nowhere to be found. But the blood was still there. We know she\u2019s dead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe didn\u2019t get a hell of a lot from the bus. I had a few snacks in my backpack and Karla had some stuff for Aaron. But other than that, we\u2019re not exactly well stocked. I\u2019m not entirely sure that we\u2019re not going to starve to death out here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m already so fucking hungry and the stale granola bar I\u2019ve had really isn\u2019t doing anything to cut it. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a rescue coming or not. Roberto keeps saying that we\u2019ll figure something out, but I\u2019m finding it pretty hard to stay confident right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI keep looking out the windows.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI keep seeing those things in the darkness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI keep thinking about Minnie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**September 12th, 2017**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSupplies are already starting to run out. It\u2019s been three days. No sun. We\u2019re all hungry, we\u2019re all miserable, we\u2019re all scared.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven Roberto\u2019s been acting differently. Up until now, I\u2019d have said that he was the cheerful one. Always acting like somebody was gonna come for us, but he\u2019s been testy lately. Karla\u2019s been on edge too, but I know it\u2019s just because she\u2019s scared. She\u2019s the one with a screaming kid to feed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the creatures came up to the gas station last night, when Aaron was having a tantrum. It tried to smash through the window to get at us. Roberto and I had to go out with some makeshift clubs to try and drive it off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe kept hitting the goddamn thing but it just wouldn\u2019t die\u2026 it should have died. But instead, it just kept looking up at us with those bulging eyes, even after we\u2019d smashed its skull to the point where it should\u2019ve been long dead. Even when its jaw was hanging off of its face\u2026 it just kept living. Eventually, we got it to retreat, at least. But it was a hell of a fight. The damn thing scratched the hell out of my arm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRoberto seemed to do most of the work. I remember watching him whail on that thing, screaming like an animal all the while. I couldn\u2019t tell who was making that howling noise, him or the creature. I wouldn\u2019t have thought that he had that kind of anger in him\u2026 but I also wouldn\u2019t have thought I\u2019d be willing to go out and fight a fucking bug eyed monster with a club made out of broken chair legs. I guess considering out current situation, we\u2019ve got a choice to either adapt or die and none of us really want to die.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat said, the more I think about it, the more I worry that sooner or later, we won\u2019t have a lot of choice in the matter. I don\u2019t really see any kind of light at the end of the tunnel here. We\u2019re running out of supplies, we\u2019re all on edge, there\u2019s been no sun in three days and now we know that those things out there don\u2019t die.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to be hopeful, I do. But looking at our situation, I can\u2019t really say I\u2019m filled with a whole lot of hope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**September 14th, 2017**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs anyone even going to read this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSamantha, are you going to read this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou\u2019re probably wondering where I am\u2026 hell, I\u2019m still wondering where I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNothing makes sense here and things just keep getting worse and worse by the day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRoberto attacked Charlene last night. He just\u2026 he just flipped out on her. One minute they were arguing, he was saying she doesn\u2019t pull her weight, she was arguing that she\u2019s 78 years old and she does what she can, and then he was on top of her, clawing at her, trying to bite her. Aaron was screaming and crying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKarla and I had to fight to pull Roberto off of her, and then we had to drag him, literally kicking and screaming into the old office out back. We\u2019ve locked him inside. But I can still hear him pounding on the door and screaming for us to let him out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt least\u2026 he used to be screaming.\n\nNow he just howls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we\u2019d dealt with Roberto, Karla and I sat by the window on watch, eating some stale chips and trying to avoid talking about what had just happened. Although it wasn\u2019t long before she said the thing that I was afraid to say.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe things that we see in the dark.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe things that are moving out there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey look an awful lot like people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt begs the question\u2026 were they human once?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWere they the people who got stuck here before us?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about that for a few days now. But Karla\u2019s the one who finally said it out loud. Are we going to go insane?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**September 15th, 2017**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere\u2019s a kids bicycle out back of the gas station. It\u2019s so rusted that if you touched it, odds are it would just disintegrate. But it\u2019s there, and it seems to have been there for so long that one of the trees has started to grow around it, absorbing it into the bark. I think about that bike a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRoberto is dead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCharlene went into the office an hour ago, and she killed him.\n\n*Charlene* killed *Roberto.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe said that it was necessary. That it was the only way we could be safe. But just looking at her, I knew that wasn\u2019t why she\u2019d done it. Looking at the blood around her mouth and on her hands, I knew she\u2019d only killed him for the fresh meat. You couldn\u2019t deny it, not even for a second. The\u2026 warm coppery taste of blood in my mouth as I bit open Charlene\u2019s throat was\u2026 satisfying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe fought hard. A lot harder than a woman her age should have fought. I\u2019d imagined that killing her would be difficult, but it wasn\u2019t. And the taste of her flesh was\u2026 I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d prefer it raw. But the squish of her meat in my teeth was divine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m going to lock myself in the office now. It\u2019s better that way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**September 17th, 2017**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAaron was crying today. I heard it when he finally stopped. I heard his voice catch in his throat as he was torn limb from bloody limb by Karla. I sat here and I did nothing. I just listened\u2026 and when the screaming was done I let myself out of the office and joined her in the feast.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe did not speak.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking into Karla\u2019s eyes, I know that she is almost as far gone as I am. She didn\u2019t seem to care about what she\u2019d done until afterward. And even then, all she could do was stare pensively down at the bloody mess she\u2019d left behind, unsure how to feel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI caved her skull in from behind with one of the clubs we made during a moment of lucidity.She never asked me to. Not out loud. But when she saw me coming, she didn\u2019t even try to run. There was only a quiet gratitude in her eyes, that she wouldn\u2019t be condemned to live this way any longer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will be returning my laptop to the bus after this.\n\nMaybe someone will find it. Maybe then, there might be some memory of us.\n\nMaybe not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe woods call to me. The hunger calls to me. But I don\u2019t want to go, and I think there\u2019s still enough of me left to hold out for just a little while longer. I\u2019m going to try and get back to the gas station after this. The fuel from the pumps still burns. And I only need a little to burn myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoodbye.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd Samantha, I\u2019m sorry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The entries above were recovered from a laptop discovered in the remains of a bus discovered off of I-5 from Seattle to Portland. The bus is believed to have gone off the road in September of 2017, but was somehow not discovered until March of 2022.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The bodies of the passengers, 26 year old Jacob Wilson, 29 year old Karla Solyak and her 6 year old son, Aaron Solyak, 78 year old Charlene Hanley, 74 year old Minnie Shorter and 38 year old Roberto Hunt, along with the driver 47 year old Preston Riles were never recovered and it is unclear what became of them.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The Lewis County Police have continued to investigate the accident, including the disappearances and why it took so long for the wreckage of the bus to be discovered, however as of yet have determined nothing* [conclusive.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)",

    "postText": "\\[[Related stories](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jflyer45/comments/13zq0a0/the_lancaster_leak_games_and_related_written/)\\]\n\nToday was the tipping point. For months, I've been working as a secretary at a small FBI office in Lancaster, a sleepy town on the outskirts of Los Angeles. My job as a secretary includes what you\u2019d expect; phone calls, donut deliveries, but also a constant need to redirect old people to the police department. Believe it or not, the Bureau doesn\u2019t care that your neighbor\u2019s dog constantly barking. Despite the monotony, I've come to appreciate the stability of my job, something I\u2019ve desperately needed as I approach my late twenties. But today didn\u2019t include any of those things. Or maybe it did. That\u2019s the problem, I can\u2019t remember.\n\nI arrived at the office and fired up the hissing Keurig coffee machine, and the next thing I knew, I was waking up in a daze as my boss wished me a happy weekend. This wasn't just a momentary lapse in memory induced by a boring day \u2013 no, it was a complete blackout. Poof. Gone in an instant and transported 8 hours in the future.\n\nStrange things have been happening at the office for a while now, but they are becoming more frequent and severe. I hadn't told anyone because I knew no one would believe me. But today I\u2019ve decided to share what\u2019s been going on as I finally have some proof of the weird shit going on here.\n\nAfter rubbing my eyes deeply from what felt like a long slumber I checked my desk for any clues about what happened. I woke my computer from sleep checking Outlook and Teams before shifting my gaze to my second monitor. That's when I saw the Word document, over 15 pages long, single-spaced. It was a detailed record of my activities, with time stamps down to the minute. The words on the page were familiar, but I couldn't remember typing them. As I read through the document, my heart raced faster with every line.\n\nI\u2019ve summarized the document below and omitted timestamps that seem irrelevant:\n\n\\[10:45 AM\\] There\u2019s an old man in a pink poncho sitting in the waiting room. I\u2019ve asked him if he needed anything but he\u2019s ignoring me. His eyes are glued to the wall as if he's waiting for something. Look, I\u2019ve seen \u2018California crazy\u2019 but this is just bizarre... It\u2019s not even raining out.\n\n\\[10:50 AM\\] The Barley twins swung by and took an exaggerated double take in an eerie unison motion. When I asked them what was wrong, they said quote \u201cJust checking if the smoking hot chick is back\u201d. I told them what I\u2019ve told them a thousand times; that my temp job replacing the old secretary is now permanent. They chuckled at my annoyance as they walked away, their eyes lingering on me a little too long. I could hear them complaining about not getting a female replacement and that I\u2019m just not \u201cfun\u201d. I rolled my eyes and went back to reading my novel.\n\n\\[11:03 AM\\] I swear the old man in the pink poncho is looking at me. In my peripheral vision, I can see his dark black eyes gazing at me. It's like he's studying me, waiting for me to make a move. But when I look up, he's back staring at the wall with an uncanny fixation. If he keeps it up, I\u2019m going to have to ask him to leave.\n\n\\[12:35 PM\\] The sound of a revving engine outside signaled the arrival of the FedEx driver yet again, demanding to know about 'the package'. Irritation bubbled inside me at the relentless daily visits from this delivery person. I couldn't tell if it was some twisted prank from the Barley twins or if the driver was genuinely delusional. I told her no, that we never will have a package for her, and that she\u2019s frankly stupid for asking. She rolled her eyes, blew a bubble from her gum, and popped it before walking away.\n\n\\[12:36 PM\\] The pink poncho man is gone.\n\n\\[12:44 PM\\] Jenson swooped by and caught me by surprise. He had that gleeful childish smile on his face as he peered over my desk and asked \u201cWaaaatttchhaaaaa doooinnngggg?\u201d. I could tell he didn\u2019t actually care but I mustered up a response.\n\n\u201cUh, nothing, just cleaning out some--\u201c.\n\n\u201cHey so did you see any packages come in? Or taken? Or any with the packages at all?\u201d\n\nHe tapped his foot nervously on the floor. Right when I was about to respond he cut me off once more, face pale and eyes twitching searching for something behind me.\n\n\u201cNever mind, pfff, it\u2019s, uh, probably nothing\u2026\u201d\n\nHe wandered in an aimless direction behind me at a hurried pace.\n\n\\[1:00 PM\\] I confronted the Barley twins while they were \u201cworking\u201d. James had his feet up on his desk, lazily flipping through a magazine, while Tommy was intently focused on a game on his computer. I could feel my blood boil as I approached them. James looked up with a grin and spoke.\n\n\u201cHey sweetheart, here to bring us coffee?\u201d\n\n\"You two better stop with the whole package thing,\" I seethed. \"Jensen blew it, his acting sucks. You know better than to take advantage of our boss\u2019s innocence. And besides, this whole damn thing is too complicated. What's the point?\"\n\nJames squinted his face in confusion. \u201cLook man, as much as I would like to take credit for whatever bothering you, it ain\u2019t us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re busy with work, just like you should be.\u201d Tommy joined and let out a playful wink.\n\nAs I glared at them both, I couldn't discern if they were telling the truth.\n\n\\[1:14 PM\\] I caught the FedEx driver trying to sneak past my desk. She had a hoody up and obnoxious black sunglasses. I whistled at her and motioned with my hands for her to come over. She sighed at getting caught.\n\nBefore she could speak, I shouted \u201cI don't have it, I don't want it, and I don\u2019t want anything to do with it! Got it?\"\n\nShe proceeded to flick me off. In response, I threw a pencil at her. I missed but it\u2019s the thought that counts.\n\n\\[2:32 PM\\] After enduring an hour-long meeting, I entered the bathroom and was hit by the putrid smell of urine and mold like a wall. I quickly scanned the three stalls, only to freeze when I saw the old man in the bright pink poncho standing in the middle one. My first thought was to leave and hold it, but my bladder had other ideas. I took the urinal to his right and did my business as fast as I could.\n\nThat's when I felt his eyes on me. I tried to ignore it and keep my eyes on my feet, but something compelled me to look up. And there he was, his eyes locked on mine slowly fixing his drooping frown to a sinister twitching grin. He pulled down his poncho hood revealing a tattoo on the side of his bald head that I couldn\u2019t quite make out. I backed up and the man followed imitating my movement and maintaining eye contact like his head was a gyroscope. It was at this point I noticed the partially see-through poncho was in fact his only article of clothing.\n\nI yelled \u201cYew dude, what the fuck?\u201d as I lifted my hand blocking my vision. But when I could smell his wretched odor get closer, I split my fingers creating a small peephole. The man\u2019s face was only inches away from mine with an inhuman smile that stretched to the sides of both of his eyes. His eyes consisted of only a black dot pupil slowly dilating, pearl white sclera, and no iris. His ivory teeth were sharp daggers tainted yellow and rotten dry red. He wailed nonsensical words that reverberated off the walls of the cramped bathroom.\n\nI screamed at him to stop, hoping someone would hear me. But he just kept moving one step closer as I took a step back, his smile growing wider and wider. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, and I knew I had to make a break for it. I frantically tore open the bathroom door, praying that he wouldn't lunge at me as I fled.\n\n\\[2:38 PM\\] Susan from HR brought me a free T-Shirt, thanks Susan!\n\n\\[2:45 PM\\] Security came by to get my report of the incident. As far as they can tell, it\u2019s just another crazy homeless person. I tried to tell them there was something different about him, that his smile was unearthly but they thought I was being hyperbolic.\n\n\\[3:59 PM\\] After making a long pitstop in the breakroom to fully decompress I returned to my desk to find a cardboard box. It lacks any address, and the cardboard is weirdly fresh without any dirt or damage. I think I\u2019m going to open it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it. After that point, just 1 minute after, I woke from my daze apparently. I don\u2019t remember any of these events. I don't even know this FedEx driver that I apparently lost my cool with and allegedly knew from the prior week. And that guy in the pink poncho? I'll have to ask Dan at IT if he has access to the security tapes and get this report I submitted to security. The only evidence I have that this happened is that I\u2019m wearing the new FBI logo embroidered shirt Susan gave to me.\n\nI want to be clear again: I'm clean as a whistle. I haven't taken any drugs or even had a drop of alcohol. So, unless I'm developing early dementia, does anyone know how this could have happened? I appreciate any comments or insights that you may have to offer, and I'll make sure to respond to them this week. I'll also post a follow-up with any new information I come across, as well as some other stories from my past that I think you'll find interesting. Thank you for reading.",

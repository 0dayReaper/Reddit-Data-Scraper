    "postText": "During my stay here on earth, I've made many fascinating discoveries. One of them are so-called diners; establishments where customers can sit down alone, in groups or pairs to chat and be served a variety of meals and beverages. [Nettie Peterson](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13dr5g0/help_im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) took me to one as soon as she deemed me well-spoken enough to appear in good society. There's Tom's Diner, the one I mentioned earlier. It's close to our places and really cozy. We've been frequenting it ever since my \"debut\". \n\nFor the first four years, the head waitress there was a hearty, saccharine lady in her forties. When she quit, I imagined that everything would go on as it was with the others filling in for her, but as Nettie always says, the only constant is change. The position was filled by a complete newcomer. \n\nI didn't take note of him right away the first time we met. He flitted around in-between the tables, delivering trays, collecting money. When he took our orders, Nettie and I were in the middle of a conversation. She ordered for the both of us so I didn't even look up at him. It was only when he came back with our beverages that I realized it. I stared at him as he handed Nettie her espresso. \n\n\"You're not the woman who normally brings us our drinks,\" I stated. \n\nHe straightened up, raising a brow. \"Yes, I am, in fact, new here. And also not a woman.\"\n\nThis prompted me to take him in fully. He was of average height, the black apron hugging his slender torso in an unusually flattering manner. The many colorful pins on it added a creative personal touch. His jaw was steadily working away at a wad of chewing gum.\n\n\"Huh.\"\n\nLooking at him made me feel *pleasantly odd,* and that little \"huh\" was the only sound I found myself able to produce. \n\nThe waiter frowned. \"Is that a problem?\"\n\n\"No. You're divine.\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"I'm what now?\" he inquired, taken aback.\n\n\"Divine. I'm sorry if I'm expressing myself improperly; I mean to say I find you very attractive.\"\n\nAgain, silence.\n\nHe flattened the flurry of golden curls on his head with his palm. \"For real?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\nThe waiter let out a quiet, very soft gasp of surprise that immediately formed into a smile\u2014an expression that I have thus far found to be unique to this particular individual. It was incredibly endearing. He cleared his throat, gracefully bending over to place my glass of coconut water in front of me. \"I\u2026 um\u2026 thanks. Thank you very much.\" He turned on his heel. \"*Divine*,\" I heard him mutter to himself as he walked off.\n\n\"Evangeline!\" Nettie's stern voice drew my attention and I shuddered under her scrutiny. \"You can't just say things like that to men you don't know!\" she scolded quietly. \n\n\"Why not?\" \n\n\"First of all, it might make him uncomfortable! He's *working* here. He's probably not looking to get hit on! Besides\u2014,\" here, she lowered her voice, \"he looks creepy. Uncanny valley-like. If you wanna date someone, I'll pick you out a nice, *handsome* guy.\"\n\n\"Oh. Do you *have* to?\"\n\n\"Hey! I'm an excellent matchmaker.\"\n\n\"That's not what I want,\" I told her frankly. \"I didn't mean to make the server uneasy, I simply meant to let him know that he struck me as winsome.\"\n\nShe flicked me between the eyes, grinning indulgently . \"Anyways, he didn't seem displeased,\" she added. \n\n\"So why was it bad that I said that?\"\n\n\"It's\u2026 a delicate matter, is all. I want you to be safe. You're not ready for that kind of thing.\"\n\n\"What kind of thing?\"\n\nNettie sighed for a long time. \n\nThat was my first encounter with the waiter. Knowing of his presence was admittedly part of the reason why my visits to the diner became more frequent. Nettie complained about it often, but this was one thing I didn't want to take her advice on. My interactions with the server stayed mostly unremarkable. She took care of that. She invited herself along every time I went, and when the waiter came up to us, she'd look at him in the nastiest way. Yesterday, I ended up telling [Kit Sutton](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13eovqy/im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_also_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) about the server, though. Her reaction was quite different. \n\n\"We're talking about that really blond guy?\" she inquired. \"Angel curls?\"\n\n\"That's the one.\"\n\nShe snorted. \"Seriously? I think he actually looks kinda creepy.\"\n\n\"That's exactly what Nettie said.\"\n\n\"Who knew. Actually, it doesn't matter what we think. If you like the guy, speak up.\" \n\n\"But I only ever see him when he's at work.\"\n\nKit shrugged. \"You can tell him you'd like to talk sometime, what's the big deal?\"\n\nRight. What was the big deal? I headed to the diner earlier today, sat down at the usual booth, ordered some coconut water and pancakes, and when the waiter came back\u2014\"Hey, would you like to talk?\" The words were out of my mouth before I could reconsider. And before I could steady myself, he'd already sat down across from me. \n\n\"Sure, what about?\"\n\n\"In general.\"\n\n\"Okay, I've got time.\" He motioned at the mostly empty diner around us. \"The others can work, too, for once. What's up? Still think I'm divine?\" His lower jaw was eagerly moving up and down, repeatedly squashing his chewing gum. I noticed a hint of hesitation in his voice that contrasted his casual tone. \n\n\"I do,\" I said steadfastly. \n\nHe chuckled brightly. \"How's the job hunt going?\"\n\n\"Not well. How come you know about that?\"\n\n\"I overhear a lot of things.\"\n\n\"I figured you'd tune out the chatter in your line of work,\" I remarked. \n\n\"I do for the most part.\" He leaned forward, gazing warmly at me from behind thick lashes. \"But you're more interesting than most people.\"\n\nMy neck grew hot. \"I am?\"\n\n\"You're not normal.\"\n\nI nearly coughed up my coconut water. \"How\u2014\"\n\n\"Look, you don't need to tell me what you are. In fact, I prefer not knowing. But, if you might muster some sympathy, then maybe you could help me with something\u2026 as a fellow outsider.\"\n\nMy heart rate slowed considerably and I let go of a soft sigh. I held his gaze, trying to commit it to memory. Sure, I wasn't the most savvy judge, but I wouldn't have thought him to be inhuman. Nothing about him registered as unsettling to me. \"What do you need?\"\n\nHe moved to sit down right beside me, leaning close to my ear as he spoke. \"Someone's been following me. They wait for me when I leave work. I've managed to keep them from finding out where I live, but they're getting harder to shake off every day. I know them. Not personally, but I know they'll come for me soon. If they get me, I'll disappear.\"\n\n\"Disappear?\" I echoed.\n\nHis face had turned an odd kind of neutral. \"They're not gonna let me live.\" He inched even closer still. \"So there's something unnatural about you. I don't mind. It's really interesting, actually.\"\n\n\"That's the second time you've called me that.\"\n\nHis shoulder brushed against mine as he shrugged. \"Can you blame me?\"\n\n\"K-kind of\u2014\" My voice broke and I had to turn my burning face away to start over. \"Kind of sounds like you only want me to be your body guard.\"\n\nHe sighed, lowering his head. \"I'm sorry I sprung this onto you. I wasn't sure I should ask at all. Since you said you wanted to talk, I just took that as a sign, I guess. Forget I said anything.\"\n\n\"Why? I'll help you. Of course I'll help. I was just wondering if you'd ever want to get to know each other beyond that.\"\n\nHe did that thing again\u2014the really low, soft gasp that turned into a smile. \"Yes,\" he said with a nod. \"I would.\"\n\nI grinned then, brightly. He held my gaze. \"This is the first time I've seen you smile. I was wondering what that looks like,\" he remarked, his tone calculative and faintly astounded. \"You're secretly just a little ball of sunshine, aren't you?\" \n\nI shrugged. \"When there's a reason to be. So, these people, what can you tell me about them?\" I asked.\n\n\"It's someone different almost every time, but it's, like, this one group. They never directly approach me in public, which is how I've managed to lose them up until now. They've been leaving these notes here for me, though. I found this one today.\" He reached into his apron pocket and produced a red piece of paper that looked like it had been torn from some kind of advertisement brochure. The words ***Come home or we'll take you*** were written on it in thick black marker. \"It's always something like that. Don't ask; it makes sense with the situation I'm in.\"\n\n\"I won't,\" I assured him. \"Keep your secrets. You're saying they'd be willing to hurt you?\"\n\n\"If they're willing to kidnap me, then yeah. Probably. That's why I need you to scare them off. Get up in their faces and be frightening.\"\n\n\"What makes you think I can do that?\"\n\n\"Come on, be honest, you're totally hiding fangs or claws or something, aren't you?\" He smirked excitedly, gum squeaking between his teeth.\n\n\"Something like that. It should be enough to make them leave you alone.\"\n\n\"Wonderful. Then will you meet me here at six? That's when I get off. They're probably gonna be here by then.\"\n\nI promised I would and I stuck to it\u2014when I returned to Tom's Diner, the server had already put on his coat and was waiting for me outside of the building. When we got on the bus, I noticed he was decidedly more anxious than he'd been during our conversation a couple hours ago. He kept looking over his shoulder and fidgeting with his gum, using the tip of his finger to pull sticky pink strings from his mouth before letting them snap back in. The real issue however was that the people he'd told me about didn't appear. We kept both our eyes open during the bus ride, but nobody was following us. This only seemed to make the waiter even more uneasy. \n\n\"Something's wrong,\" he kept telling me under his breath. \"But you gotta believe me, there's someone after me all the time, normally.\"\n\nI assured him I did believe him, but we nevertheless arrived at his apartment without spotting anything strange. He seemed to be unsure whether to be relieved or unsettled by that. I offered to stay a while, but he told me he'd be alright. I gave him my phone number in case anything else happened with the promise that we'd do the same thing tomorrow. This seemed to soothe his nerves considerably, and he saw me off with the same ready smile I had become accustomed to.\n\nI returned home to find Kit typing away on her dingy old laptop. She was sending out application emails left and right, apparently eager to keep her promise. We looked through job offerings around town. Turns out they were searching for lifeguards to work the beach again in the summer. \n\n\"Actually not a bad job when you think about it,\" my roommate pondered. \"I'd get to work on my tan and look at pretty girls all day\u2026 Too bad I'm deathly afraid of the ocean.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\nShe smiled thinly. \"The ocean and I aren't on speaking terms at the moment. What about you?\"\n\n\"I can't swim.\"\n\nWe both jumped at the shrill sound of my phone ringing. I hastened to pick it up\u2014unknown number. The waiter. It was the first thought that entered my mind. I answered the call, holding the phone up to my ear with trembling fingers. \"Hello?\" I breathed. No response. I could pick up on a low voice talking in the background, only snippets of speech reaching my ear.\n\n*\"Little shit\u2026 think we'd let\u2026 factory\u2026\"*\n\nMy blood froze. I ended the call and tossed the phone aside. \"Something's wrong. I need your car,\" I told Kit, biting down on my quivering lips. *I should have never left him alone.*\n\nShe looked at me, her bright eyes wide and startled. It took her merely a moment to spring into action, grabbing her jacket and fumbling out her keys. \"I'm coming with you,\" she announced breathily. There was no time to argue. We ran down the stairs, bursting outside and hopping into her beat-up station wagon. \"Directions!\" Kit bellowed as she stepped on the gas. I did my best to navigate her through the streets, my memory serving me right as we thankfully ended up outside the waiter's building. I ordered Kit to stay behind as I dashed to the front door. I pressed my open palm against the tableau of doorbells, ringing every last one until finally, some unit buzzed me in. I sprinted up the stairs, taking two steps at once until I reached the entrance to the waiter's apartment. \n\nThe door was ajar. There wasn't a single sound coming from inside, only an eerie white glow. I stopped in my tracks, straining to listen for anything at all. A low static hum reached my ears, not unlike that of a tv. I could feel my heart thumping, blood rushing to my head. I knew there had to be something behind that door I did not want to see, something that would undoubtedly add to my nightmares. I pushed the thoughts aside, allowing my eyes to fall shut for only a second as I took the final step to cross the threshold. \n\nI walked down the same little hallway I'd glimpsed before when I'd said goodbye to the waiter. Silently placing one foot in front of the other, I made my way over to the door that lay ahead. It, too, was open just a crack, unnatural light falling through. My pulse sped up further, dread oozing into every limb. I stopped just in front of the entrance and slid off my sweater, letting it fall to the floor as the four tentacles began to unfurl on my back. When I nudged the door, it swung open with a soft creak, giving way to a sight that caused me to freeze mid-motion.\n\nThe room in front of me was bathed in the pale glow of the tv screen, its deep hum droning in my ears like a distant siren. However my gaze was instantly drawn to the two people in the very middle of the room. The waiter was lying sprawled out on the floor, his golden curls spread around his head like a halo. His eyes were wide open and unreactive, his face expressionless. He was staring at the ceiling, his features empty and absent. My breath caught in my throat, a pang of terror twisting my guts. Even without stepping any closer, even without checking his pulse or his breathing, I could tell that I was not looking at a living thing anymore. Through the sound of my pulse thrumming, I directed my blurry gaze at the person leaning over him.\n\nIt was a man. He was crouching on the floor between the waiter's legs. He had rolled up his shirt and was *fiddling around* with his stomach. Completely absorbed in his morbid handiwork, he didn't notice as I inched forward, squinting to make it what he was doing. His fingers were dancing across the server's skin in strange patterns, and then, all of a sudden\u2026 he peeled it aside.\n\nI have no idea how I managed not to scream, not to gag or throw up on the spot. Instead, I stood still as a statue, numb with fear and nausea. I didn't know why I let it happen. Part of me simply had to see what he was doing.\n\nThe man's fingers slid into the waiter's body, causing a revolting, wet squeaking noise as he pushed the flesh and muscle tissue aside. I winced. Were insides supposed to sound like that? With a frustrated sigh, the stranger withdrew his fingers from the corpse and flattened the flayed patch of skin back against the server's stomach. He then lifted the other man's limp arm and brought it up to his face. Picking up a scalpel, he cut up a large flap of skin from his wrist. He was just about to peel it back with the same surgical precision when my body finally broke out of its rigor and I lunged. \n\nThe man, now alerted to my presence, let out a bloodcurdling scream, but he caught himself pretty quickly. He evaded my grasp, stumbling back and reaching for his side. \"Stay the fuck away from me! Whatever the fuck you are!\" he barked, drawing something I realized too late was a gun. \n\n\"Who are you?\" I yelled out, reaching for the weapon with arms and tentacles alike.\n\nHe fired. \n\nA blinding pain tore into my shoulder and I *shrieked*. Flying into a panicked frenzy, I employed a very particular combat strategy\u2014I began thrashing around wildly, hitting everything within reach. One of my tentacles whipped the gun out of the stranger's hand, and when he scrambled to retrieve it as it skittered across the floor, I pounced on him. Grabbing onto both sides of his head, I twisted his neck, pulling wildly until I heard a loud, sickening *snap*. The body beneath me fell limp and I rolled off, tears stinging my vision as I clutched the dripping warmth of my shoulder. Blood was running freely down my chest, pooling in the hollow palm I helplessly pressed over the wound. There was so much red. \n\nAnd that's when I realized something. I slowly turned my head to look at the waiter and his mangled arm and stomach. \n\nThey weren't bleeding. \n\nThat was the last thing I saw before passing out. \n\nI woke up back home, lying on my couch, a familiar blue-framed face regarding me in concern. A smile of relief crossed her features as I met her gaze. I let out a drawn-out moan, pushing myself into a sitting position. My shoulder was throbbing, but it wasn't half as bad anymore. Glancing down at it, I found that a thick white bandage had been neatly wrapped around it, the tissue pristine and softer than cotton. \"You patched me up,\" I stated.\n\n\"I, uh. I didn't, actually. It was him.\"\n\nMy jaw dropped. \"The waiter?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I was waiting in the car for, like, twenty minutes and then he came down and loaded you in. That guy is stronger than he looks. He didn't say anything, though. What happened up there?\"\n\nMy throat worked. \"I don't think you oughta know.\"\n\n\"Actually, I'm pretty sure I should! I was\u2026 really freaked out, and now you've got that thousand-yard-stare going on\u2026\"\n\nAfter a minute, I tuned out her well-meaning chatter. Truth be told, I have no idea what to make of this. I don't think I'm going to swing by the diner today.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13dr5g0/help_im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[2: deadbeat roommate](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13eovqy/im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_also_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[4: random relocation](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13gjpwd/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_does_anybody/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[5: concert](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13heih5/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[6: first date](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ib2es/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_my_first/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

That way there are no nasty surprises, you can be prepared, and there are no chances for miscommunication. It will also strengthen your bonds and you will garner more trust in each other. \nJust some unwarranted advice from a creature who's rooting for your success.",

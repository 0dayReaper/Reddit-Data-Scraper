    "postText": "How it began \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ci94do/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app\n\nAnd what happened next\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cinu8u/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app\n\nWhen I finally caught up with Mrs Hemmings herself\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cj2g4k/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app\n\nAnd when the trouble really started \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cjintp/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app\n\n\nWhen I first saw Natalia all I could picture was Georgia. The way her skin melted off her face, the smell of her hair burning and the sound that she made. \n\nI didn\u2019t have time to count but there were more than I originally thought. I figured these must have been the 15 people Prudence talked about, entering the flats that burned before it happened. I already knew that Natalia was one of them. \n\nEddie and Ellie clutched Terri\u2019s skirt, trembling with fear. I wanted to help protect them, but I still couldn\u2019t help but tremble a little myself every time I caught a glimpse of those hollow voids where their eyes were. \n\n\u201cHi Terri, the kids said we could borrow some sugar?\u201d She asked menacingly, grinning at the frightened family stood next to me. After a moment or two of intense staring Natalia finally addressed me. She appeared to be the spokesperson for the group. \u201cHow\u2019s your friend doing? It was a shame we had to end our visit. I was enjoying her company.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t speak about her! She\u2019s got nothing to do with you, you sick bitch!\u201d I screamed at her, I couldn\u2019t bare looking at her face again. \u201cYou don\u2019t scare me with all your freak friends. I\u2019m not going to let you hurt this lady or her kids!\u201d\n\nNatalia chuckled. I gulped. \n\nI may talk a good game but I am no hero. Mere days ago I was just a young girl excited to move in with her boyfriend and now here I am. My boyfriend\u2019s dead, my flat is like living in my own personal horror movie and I\u2019m standing up challenging demonic flame neighbours to defend demonic looking children. \n\nBut when I said she didn\u2019t scare me, I meant it. Something inside me was eradicating any fear of these people, I just wanted to protect the residents. Life really does throw curveballs. \n\n\u201cI know you aren\u2019t scared. I saw it in your eyes when you stuck that big knife in my throat. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\n\n\u201cMy brothers and sisters are not freaks. You\u2019re the freaks! Thinking that your lives have meaning. We watch you people go about your day to day lives and your mundane routines and nothing really changes. Your lives are pointless and disposable.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we set the fire, all those years ago.\u201d  She chuckled throughout her words. There was an animation in them like she was a psychotic cartoon character, finally catching its prey after 138 episodes of chasing. \n\n\u201cThose people weren\u2019t disposable...\u201d Terri mumbled, barely a decibel higher than a whisper.\n\n\u201cWhat was that Terri? Did you have something to say.\u201d Natalia went from psychotic cartoon to school bully. She made my skin crawl.\n\n\u201cI was only a child, but those people were friends of my parents, they were good people.\u201d Terri said with slightly more confidence. \n\nNone of the other people had moved. They just stood there staring. \n\n\u201cWhy would you burn people alive? What can you possibly gain?\u201d I interjected, taking a slight step between Natalia and Terri and the kids. I could see she was getting ready to go for them and I couldn\u2019t let it happen. \n\n\u201cWe were living with the great leader, Michael. All of us. Living in the righteous manner that he had directed us to live\u201d She gestured to the people around her. The name Michael appeared to inspire some sort of emotion in the group. \n\n\u201cMichaels brother Jonathan lived here, on the floor we burned. He let us hang out there sometimes, but he didn\u2019t live the righteous way that we did. He didn\u2019t like our beliefs, but he took us in when we lost the place we were staying because of the growth of the group. Him and Michael rarely saw eye to eye. They argued passionately. \n\n\u201cOur group never believed in living within the constraints of societal norms and we were up at all hours, we came and went as we pleased, embracing freedoms and listened to music as we did introspective work.\u201d \n\nTerri shoved the kids further behind her and snapped, infuriated. \n\n\u201cYou were a group of entitled, bratty hippies following some middle aged, mentally ill twat. Listen to yourself! The stereotypical cultish drivel coming out of your mouth right now!\u201d Terri cried. I was shocked at her outburst. Although I couldn\u2019t have agreed more. It did sound like cultish drivel. It made me so angry that this was what an entire floor of people died over. \n\nAs Terri ended her rant the curtains hanging on the window behind her burst into flames. I jumped and felt my heart skip a beat. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t insult us. I\u2019m sick of hearing simple minded people call us a cult.\u201d Came from the back row. An average looking man with dark hair and jeans had piped up, smiling and watching the curtains burn. He had done that. They were all capable of what Natalia had done to Georgia at the very least.\n\nFor the first time since the people had entered Terri\u2019s flat my nerves of steel had wavered. I realised that we were only alive because they were allowing it so far. We were in big trouble.\n\nTerri swiftly shut up and Natalia continued her story.\n\n\u201cMichael was the true leader. Not like all the fakes you hear of in the news. The people you\u2019re talking about. He was teaching us to build a world of peace and harmony. But he didn\u2019t deny that in order to do that you had to eradicate the non believers. He taught us to embrace the bad in us. To harness it so that we could do extraordinary things.\u201d She smiled wickedly as her hands glowed hot coals as she spoke. \n\nIt may have sounded like cultish drivel but Michael being a total faker wouldn\u2019t explain their powers. \n\n\u201cThings went wrong when someone went to the police after Michael and Jonathan had a terrible argument one night. When the police arrived Jonathan told us to go. \n\nThe group had been planning to leave this building anyway. We\u2019d had nothing but interruption and trouble in our time here, this place is weird. But we had nowhere immediate to go. The police already disliked us after overcrowding the last property. We didn\u2019t need any more attention. \n\n\u201cMichael was furious. We brainstormed in a field for hours who could have done it. I personally suspected the next door neighbour, Mavis. The woman was so nosey, always knocking and asking us to keep noise down, interrupting our spiritual sessions. \n\n\u201cMichael couldn\u2019t make a certain judgement on the person who had done it. All we thought we were sure of was that they had to be on the same floor. So he instructed us to go back that night and eradicate the whole floor and every non believer who lived there. \n\n\u201cAs you know, we obliged.\u201d This incited sick laughter from the crowd. I waited, forcing myself to let her finish. Buying time. \n\n\u201cWe took pleasure in their screams, in watching every man woman and child go up in flames through their front door windows. It was the first time we\u2019d unleashed all that energy and we felt so powerful!\n\n\u201cBut then as we left the burning hallway behind us and entered the stairwell, this building found a way to fuck us over one more time. \n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t give you a number on the amount of times we tried to run down those stairs, leave our glorious victory behind us and return to Michael. It didn\u2019t matter how many times we tried. \n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t make it past that floor, the stairs wouldn\u2019t let us. It didn\u2019t take long before the fire reached the stairwell we were trapped in, burning us all, along with the non believers. We died just in time for the fire engine to arrive. \n\n\u201cWe may have been dead but we didn\u2019t disappear. We couldn\u2019t leave the building, we were stuck just wandering it, in and out of the burned flats and hallways but not allowed anywhere else unless we were asked. It was awful. We didn\u2019t try to cause any trouble at first. We waited for Micheal to come and find us, instruct us. \n\n\u201cTwo months passed and he hadn\u2019t come. Instead came confirmation. A newspaper put through the door of the building. Headline news. \n\n\u201c*Tower block resident Bernie Hemmings information vital to imprisonment of local cult leader on drug charges.*\u201d\n\nI gasped. I couldn\u2019t believe I hadn\u2019t found that when I was researching Prue. But I suppose local news wasn\u2019t so heavily online back then. Natalia saw my shocked expression and grinned wider than before.\n\n\u201cThe old bat didn\u2019t tell you that then?\u201d She asked, although it wasn\u2019t really a question. \u201cThat her stupid husband is the whole reason we\u2019re here!\u201d \n\n\u201cWe started to really cause issues then. Did anything within our power to fuck the whole building over. But it didn\u2019t take them long to work out that we had to be asked to come in. \n\n\u201cWe only stopped when Prue worked out a way we could die a second time, and that we wound come back again. She killed two of our group. She was the only person that could stop us. We couldn\u2019t do shit with her around. We stopped and reached a stalemate. Then she moved out. We were going to honour that stalemate. Until you stabbed me. Prue\u2019s gone. It\u2019s fair game in here now.\u201d\n\nAs Natalia got angrier a member of her group started getting agitated, they all soon followed like a hive mind, working as one, the stillness became chaotic, with all of them moving and making noise. \n\nI didn\u2019t notice at first when one started walking towards Terri and the kids, but I noticed when it got near.\n\nIt was a teen girl, slender and pretty, but still unsettlingly average. As she got within a metre of the family Ellie suddenly went rigid. The claws that replaced her fingernails grew longer and sharper, with jagged edges from growing so fast. The voids deepened, if that was even possible. \n\nShe opened her mouth to reveal rows of sharp teeth, blood caked where the tooth meets the gum where they had grown too quickly as well. Ellie jumped. She reached out towards the girl and slashed her face with the claws, leaving deep gouges across her eyes.  She clung on to the girl using her claws as wall pegs keeping herself at eye level. \n\nEddie controlled the crowd. His own claws grew and he ran towards them, sending them scattering out of the flat, random bursts of flames erupted everywhere. Lighting up the whole room. \n\nShit had hit the fan. The two demon children were successfully fending off a group of 15 dead superhuman cultists. Natalia ran from them too, but kept her eyes locked on mine as she did. As she ran from the flat she spoke to me. \n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t over!\u201d She screamed, and I knew that it wasn\u2019t. \n\nI stayed on Terri\u2019s sofa that night, we organised all the burned items in the house and threw things out before we crashed out in the early hours. The kids claws retracted and they returned to their earlier state. Causing mischief in the hallways. They were too young to really understand.\n\nI didn\u2019t sleep much. Nothing new. \n\nWhen I woke up Terri was still asleep. I didn\u2019t want to disturb her so I walked back to my flat, desperate to avoid anything strange on my way. The stairs must have noticed, because they didn\u2019t skip on my way up. \n\nI hadn\u2019t checked the time when I left Terri\u2019s but I reached my door at the same time as a familiar face. Postman Ian was stood there, dropping letters on my doorstep. \n\n\u201cHey, love!\u201d He shouted as he noticed me. \n\n\u201cI need to talk, can you come inside, just five minutes? Please?\u201d I practically begged him at the doorstep.\n\nI told him everything that had happened the night before. How Natalia was out for revenge and I was the object of her rage. I begged him to tell me how to kill them, but he claimed he didn\u2019t know. He said if kept my doors locked and didn\u2019t let them in then I\u2019d be fine. \n\nHe looked shirty as I mentioned killing them. Didn\u2019t even suggest asking Prudence how to do it. Something was telling me there wasn\u2019t much point.  He seemed so disingenuous.\n\nI wanted to trust him. So badly I wanted to trust him. I had been so vulnerable with him over Jamie.\n\nBut if Prudence Hemmings could forget to mention what Bernie had done, and conveniently never pass on the method to kill these awful people, leaving them around to terrorise her friends and neighbours... then could she be a liar too. Could I really trust Ian? \n\nWhen he provided no answers and no real help something inside me told me that I needed to get him out of my flat. I needed to rethink. Start working things out on my own. I made excuses to Ian and sent him on his rounds. \n\nPrudence left me these rules, but she left so much out. How do I know I wasn\u2019t always a pawn in some sick game. Her fantasy life as a puppet master, setting me up to fail. She\u2019s kept her granddaughter in a cage for years. Maybe she enjoys suffering. \n\nI wasn\u2019t going to give up easily though. Natalia wasn\u2019t going to win. \n\nI decided then and there that I needed to attend the committee meeting today and start building an army against Natalia. I didn\u2019t need Prue\u2019s help or her methods. With enough manpower I could do it myself. \n\nThis was war.\n\nThe next steps : https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ckw07c/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app",

I think he is/was the Ian of the garden. Take away his purpose and what do you think will be left of him?\n\n\nFourth\n\nI wouldn\u2019t trust anyone being in her situation. At least not someone tied so closely to the nonhuman parts of the house. Especially not after a declaration of war against some of the inhabitants.\n\n\n\nBut on the other hand Derek doesn\u2019t cause direct harm to you. So no harm in talking and trying to find out what else he knows about. Just don\u2019t belittle his work and try to stay on his good side. Oh, and watch out which suggestion you take to heart.\n\n\nI\u2019m also thinking the house works as a prison for evil beings. Helping it\u2019s inhabitants. But that\u2019s the reason I don\u2019t know where to put Ian and Derek.\n\n\nBest of luck out there",

I think if you just somehow find a way to kill those fire ghosts and renew the deal or treaty itd be balanced yet again. Grief is difficult but war could kill the entire hotel",

I think that's why Natalia's group was messing with the kids. They thought if they tricked them and got in that they'd be able to kill them and remove any threat they possess. But, all that changed when the culty teen approached Terri, Elle attacked while her brother held them at bay. I don't think Natalia knew just how powerful the kids are and she's also underestimated the power of friendship &amp; love, imo \ud83d\ude42",

And I don't need to say that balance is a central theme here.\n\nI think your best bet is to work *with* the building, not against it. Joining the committee is a good start. Also, while it's definitely risky, what I'd do if I were in your shoes would be to purposefully not pay the rent. I know Prue warned you about the meeting being unpleasant, but she survived and answers are what you need right now. It's highly likely that some masks will fall off in the process.\n\nAnother thing you could do is to call the estate agency for the damage caused in Terri's apartment. Prue was very specific about this and that you should not try to repair stuff yourself, so they must be in on the secret, too. In other words, this is the time to go all in with the cards you've been dealt.",

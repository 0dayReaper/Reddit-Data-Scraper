    "postText": "Before I begin my story I must maintain that my sentence to death was a wrong and vile thing to do. I maintain that I am not a killer. I did not kill the schoolchildren the authorities decided to hang me for.\n\nMy sentence to death, I must maintain, is a huge misunderstanding. There must be forces out there against me, who conspired to put me in prison for this very experiment, this accursed expedition. \n\nI am not deranged. I am not insane.\n\nThe man in the odd multicolored sweater paid me a visit a week before my scheduled execution date. \u201cYou are the former schoolteacher Chet Adami?\u201d he asked, polite, offering me a plastic cup of coffee.\n\nI nodded, taking a sip. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill those kids,\u201d I reiterated, for about the thousandth time. \u201cAre you the uh, priest guy? That comes before-\u201d\n\nHe shook his head and waved away the guards. \u201cMy name is Canopy Hydrangea,\u201d he introduced, extending a hand. I shook it. \u201cI understand you may not be guilty, despite what the state believes.\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cFinally, someone who-\u201d\n\nHe cut me off. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in your story. Whether you die or not is of no consequence to the people I represent,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut I am here to offer you a deal. There\u2019s a place the people I represent need exploring, and I need volunteers.\u201d\n\nHe produced a sheet of paper and a pen. \u201cThis agreement,\u201d he clasped it into my hands, \u201chas you join a team of expendable, uh, volunteers such as yourself on this expedition. You get in, get the things we need, and get out- and you\u2019re free for life.\u201d\n\nThis was better than dying in prison.\n\nI asked him what place this was that I\u2019d be sent to. He told me I had to sign the form first. \u201cI\u2019ll do it, then,\u201d I cheered, signing the document.\n\nHe smiled and patted me on the shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll even give you a whole new identity,\u201d he offered. And with that, he seized the document away from me and left the building.\n\nWithin hours I was blindfolded, sedated, and transported. When I awoke I was strapped to a bed in a helicopter, with four others beside me, all beginning to wake up.\n\nThe man who\u2019d offered me the deal was there too, sucking on a lollipop while rearranging documents and photographs.\n\nThese images, I assumed, was the place they wanted us to explore. They were mostly all aerial photos, a sea of endless green and the occasional bird. And yet, there was more- images of impossible landscapes, dreamlike beings.\n\n\u201cAh, you guys are awake!\u201d he clapped once, and walked over.\n\nThe next few moments were a flash as he re-injected us with some sort of blue, wriggling substance. It was cold, and I swear it pulsed inside my arm.\n\nThen we had landed, and the group was quickly taken inside a compound. We were freed and sat down in some sort of meeting room. More people were inside.\n\nA blue haired lady joined the man.\n\n\u201cWelcome, volunteers,\u201d he announced, pointing to a projector. \u201cYou are all, save for one, prisoners on death row,\u201d he reminded. \u201cThis offer today is simple- you enter the forest, travel to an outpost we have recently lost contact with,\u201d he turned on the projector, displayed a bright red cylinder labeled \u2018SYSTEM RECORDER-A32\u2019, \u201cand recover this data module.\u201d\n\nThe woman spoke next. \u201cEasy, right?\u201d she counted us. \u201cWe\u2019ll provide maps,\u201d she gestured to tablets. \u201cBut this forest is different.\u201d\n\nThey proceeded to explain the reason they need \u2018volunteers\u2019 for the assignment then.\n\nWe were on an island somewhere in the Java Sea. The island had a massive forest in the center, one that at first glance seemed as normal as ever. This changed when an international mining company sent in a team of geologists to determine if there was anything of note beyond the forest.\n\nThis team never returned.\n\nNor did a second team, armed with weapons. Or an environmentalist group that ventured in to document new species. So then the organization our recruiters had come from entered the forest.\n\nWe were on the outskirts of the forest, at a place they were calling Ake Base.\n\nOver the past month, they had begun to map the forest and determine why so many hadn\u2019t returned. The reason was illogical- the forest was bigger than the island itself.\n\nDrones that ventured in should have come out the other side- yet remained inside the forest, encountering bizarre phenomena and creatures undocumented.\n\nEvery so often, the forest would slope downwards, revealing a new layer with new and distinct ecosystems.\n\n\u201cRecently though,\u201d Canopy concluded, \u201cwe\u2019ve lost contact with several outposts in the third layer to eighth layers.\u201d He changed the slide to one of the lost outposts, standing alone amidst a vibrant, alien forest. \u201cYou enter the forest, get to your team\u2019s assigned outpost, get back out with the data and you\u2019ll be set for life.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes anyone choose to rescind their agreement?\u201d the woman asked. \u201cIt\u2019s either death, or this, and frankly, your chances here aren\u2019t that better.\u201d\n\nThere were some who raised their hands. \u201cHell no!\u201d a man shouted. \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 back to life!\u201d  The woman had them taken away. We heard gunfire outdoors. No life row for him.\n\nWhoever they were- they were serious about this.\n\nThey started to call out names and assign teams.\n\nMy team, was small, four of us. There was a mercenary named Leo who kept talking about the food the organization had brought us. He seemed pleasant, charismatic, and I almost forgot he was a criminal.\n\nThere was a scientist called Anya who, as she joked, was \u2018serving infinite life sentences\u2019 for crimes against humanity. She was given the codes and a booklet of things to watch out for in what they called the \u2018Sea of Green\u2019.\n\nThen there was Gail. She was quieter than the three of us, and had an almost eerie vibe to her. She didn\u2019t tell us what she\u2019d done to get here, but she was there nonetheless.\n\nThankfully, we were given the closest- and safest outpost. A little place in Layer Three, marked by the map as only a few hours walk away.\n\nWe set off the next day.\n\nThe forest, in the beginning, seemed to almost invite us in. The birds chirped and danced, unafraid of mankind. We even fed them the nuts we\u2019d been given as breakfast rations, which they seemed to enjoy.\n\nAbout an hour in, things changed. The light from the sun barely pierced the canopy, and at times, we had to utilize our flashlights to see what was in front of us. Leo took the lead, hacking away at the branch and vine in front of us.\n\nThe forest was starting to look like a jungle- and yet, as we traversed it never seemed to choose which one it wanted to be.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d Anya hissed, as we crossed a stream that seemed oddly familiar. She read from the booklet, then to the map on tablets we\u2019d been given. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a circle.\u201d\n\nLeo shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI don\u2019t remember turning.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I agreed, catching up from behind.\n\nAnya shared the booklet. \u201cIt\u2019s one first phenomena researchers encounter,\u201d she explained. \u201cThis place plays tricks on us- we need to follow the stream.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then,\u201d Gail pointed out, \u201cwe\u2019d be going in the wrong direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust the book,\u201d Anya concluded. We followed the stream then, and the path started to grow denser, as if the forest hated us for traveling further. But the path was right, and the forest changed as we journeyed.\n\nAn hour later the forest had changed. It had sloped downwards a bit, inviting us to the second layer of the maze. The trees seemed higher, and the light was now gone completely.\n\nThis was when we started to hear it. Click-click.\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d I asked, turning. Click-click.\n\nAnya rushed through the book. \u201cIt\u2019s not documented.\u201d\n\nClick-click. And then we saw lights in the distance, lights that as we continued walking, were revealed to us as bulbous fruit on the trees that glowed an eerie electric blue.\n\nClick-click. \u201cYou sure it\u2019s not in that book?\u201d Leo questioned, switching his machete out for a gun. Click-click.\n\nThe clicks were getting louder, each one sending a jolt of uneasy fear down my spine. We moved closer together now, fearing the unknown that were in these- A bush in front of us rustled. Leo aimed his weapon.\n\nA deer- no, something like a deer popped out, gently squawking. It was\u2026 wrong in every sense, but it seemed more occupied in chewing a flower than us.\n\nThe small creature had the antlers of a deer, yes, but it also had the face of an old man. Not to mention six fists full of thumbs at the end of its legs. It inspected a glowing fruit with it\u2019s odd thumbs.\n\n\u201cEw,\u201d Gail commented, disgusted. \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d\n\nAnya didn\u2019t have time to look for answers before a black, insectine limp shot out of one of the bulbous fruits and impaled the deer-thing. It screamed an all too human scream and struggled.\n\nWe backed away- and by then, the noise was overwhelming. Click-clickClick-clickClick-clickClickclickClickclickClick-clickClick-click. They erupted from every single one of the bulbous fruits, and things began to pour out of them.\n\nThe limbs, see, were attached to a head. The a simple sphere that opened into buzzsaws of teeth that grotesquely clicked as they opened. The face-deer only screamed as the clicking creatures devoured it.\n\n\u201cRun!\u201d Leo reminded, shooting as some started to near us. \u201cRun!\u201d\n\nThat shook us out, and we ran, terror in our very veins. They seemed more interested in the fallen deer than us- but we still ran until we could no longer.\n\nActually, it was until I fell off and entered the third layer.\n\nA weight appeared on my chest and I fought it off, thinking I was about to die- but the soft, furry creature atop me jumped off. It wasn\u2019t one of the clicking monsters.\n\nAnd then I realized the third layer was bright. The trees themselves were glowing now, not the insect fruits of before. And there were a whole host of new, bizarre creatures.\n\nThe thing I\u2019d pushed off was some sort of rabbit, covered in glowing blue stripes. If layer two had been a forest of darkness this was it\u2019s very opposite.\n\nIn the skies there were ribbons of glowing creatures- thin kites on an unseen wind. The trees were alive with all sorts of furried friends, darting here and there and eating odd colored berries that didn\u2019t seem real.\n\nAnya pointed and spoke, \u201cLook!\u201d It was the outpost, in ruins.\n\n\u201cBut what attacked it?\u201d Gail murmured, as we walked over.\n\nWe entered through a hole in the wall. The place was oddly peaceful, calming, now home to bioluminescent little ants that dotted the place. Occasionally, one or two of the face-deer would appear, licking the dots up with twin tongues that emerged from it\u2019s too-human face.\n\n\u201cCute,\u201d Leo joked, picking one up and stroking it. It screamed back at him, chilling and he dropped it. \u201cNever doing that again.\u201d\n\nThe place was\u2026 too peaceful. And- \u201cwhat happened to their bodies?\u201d I posited. \u201cIf they were attacked- where\u2019s their blood? Their corpses?\u201d\n\nAnya shrugged. \u201cIt is odd- perhaps they got devoured.\u201d She gestured to the many oddities around us. \u201cBut you\u2019re right, there should be bones, at least.\u201d\n\nThis was when we heard the screaming. And all of a sudden every single creature retreated away, disappearing from view, save for the tiny ants inside with us. The screaming was a cacophony of voices, realer than the ones we\u2019d heard from the face-deer.\n\n\u201cI think we need to go,\u201d Leo whispered, holding out the red \u2018data module\u2019 in his hands. \u201cNow.\u201d\n\nThe screaming got ever closer, and the trees in front of the outpost, beyond a window, started to shake. \u201cI concur.\u201d\n\nWe were backing away when we heard the squelching of something loud and heavy. Turning around, we saw the screaming creature we\u2019d heard. It was massive, fleshy, and filled with tiny gaping holes, some filled with eyes, all rising, breathing as one.\n\nI nearly threw up. But that was for a different reason. \n\nThe holes were one thing. But the screaming, severed bodies of dozens of people attached the the eye-full monster was another. They screamed and screamed, their bodies unneatly joined and sown into the creature.\n\nIt sniffed the air and walked over to the glass, looking in as we hid. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I squealed. \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d\n\nThe face of a victim in military clothes appeared at the window, screaming, face slowly popping, skin repairing and being digested all at once. Anya flipped through the pages. \u201cThey called it a Fleshweave. It absorbs bodies and eats them that way.\u201d\n\nThat would explain the lack of bodies we\u2019d seen. \n\nThe window shattered- and the thing began to force itself on it, flesh turning to churned cylinders through the window. The bodies, crushed further, screamed some more. \n\nSo we ran as the beasts fell into the room with a plop. And despite it\u2019s heavy, gluttonous form it charged forwards, faster than it looked.\n\nOut the outpost we went. I felt a meaty hand hit me and then I fell. It stalked towards me, but a gunshot from Leo burst it\u2019s pus-ridden hand, covered my in grotesque, viscous liquid.\n\nI picked myself up and ran from the screaming thing, up the steep slope and climbing onto the second layer. \n\nI fell again, but Anya caught me, helping me up. \n\nLeo did the same for Gail- but she slipped and fell back into the third layer. The thing approached her, all of it\u2019s pulsing eyes upon her. \u201cHelp me!\u201d she bellowed. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me-\u201d\n\nLeo prepared to jump down- but it was too late. The Fleshweave simply picked her up and it opened it\u2019s skin, forging her into her body- er, her top half,- it severed the rest.\n\n\u201cGo!\u201d I snapped, dragging the mercenary to action. The creature behind us lifted itself onto the dark forest and continued to follow.\n\nGail, merged with the other unfortunate bodies, screamed. I almost stopped in terror from the sound, but flight-or-fight forced me to continue. \n\nClick-click. We found ourselves back in the center of the abode with the insect fruit. And the insects were clearly attracted to the stench of decay the monster emanated. Limbs emerged, and the face-beetles jumped up and swarmed the creatures. \n\nI don't know if the creature was killed by it. I only remember Gail\u2019s face as the insects started to pick her body- and so many others like her- apart.\n\nThe way out seemed harder than going in, but we made it. We survived. We reached the outpost and handed our data module to the man who\u2019d offered us the deal. \u201cImpressive,\u201d he congratulated. \u201cYou\u2019re the first team back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want out now,\u201d I panted. \u201cBack to real life.\u201d\n\nHe patted me on the shoulder and gave me a sad smile. \u201cAccording to the world you\u2019ve already died by suicide in your cell,\u201d he informed. \u201cSee, there\u2019s a way the people I work for have operated so cleanly for the past few centuries.\u201d He paused and took a step back. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford loose ends, see, and you\u2019ve shown us you have the guts to survive Bandai La- er, the Sea of Green.\u201d\n\nI took a step back, panicking. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\nHe sighed. \u201cWe can\u2019t give you a new life and risk exposing our operation here,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd we still need ah, expendable people to lead us to whatever\u2019s in the center of the island.\u201d He handed me a can of soda. \u201cWelcome to your new life. The Company really values your dedication as a treasured employee.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I don\u2019t want this. I was promised freedom. And they can\u2019t keep me from exposing them- I\u2019ve typed this up and Anya did something to the tablet so I can receive and post things online.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if this\u2019ll work. But if it is: I\u2019m on an island somewhere in the Java Sea. There\u2019s a forest that goes on forever and I\u2019m being held as some sort of explorer by some Company.\n\nFind me. Before I die.\n\n\n[Company Issue Warning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ymah5/i_work_for_a_company_that_studies_cursed_places/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

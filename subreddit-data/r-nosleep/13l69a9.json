    "postText": "Something pretty bad happened. On a scale of one to ten, with one being accidental defecation in public and ten being the end of the world, it's probably a solid six. That doesn't sound too dramatic, but you have to consider the scales. I should probably start at the beginning.\n\nNettie had me and Kit pick her up at the kindergarten today. Apparently, her car had broken down, which really just topped off an insanely stressful day for her. My roommate eagerly agreed for us to come to her aid together, insisting that she drive. Damn that fancy license of hers. People who are legally allowed to drive just have it all, don't they. \n\nNettie got in with us looking like an entire color palette. Her hair was matted with stains of blue and pink and yellow, her skin and clothing streaked with paint. She let out a long, shivering sigh as she settled into the worn backseat. Her downcast eyes and furrowed brows told of a terrible day with the larvae. \n\n\"Fingerpainting day?\" I offered.\n\n\"Yeah. Not only that\u2026 One of the parents came in after the kids were gone, and he was looking for his son's plushie. I said I hadn't seen it but then he went nuts on me. Kept going, *Where is it? Where the hell is it?* and I was like, *Dude, I don't know*, and then he flipped out even more when I told him to leave. He left after a while but for some reason, now I'm the asshole for going, and I quote, hysterical on him! A bunch of the other teachers saw it all and they acted like I was the crazy one, e-even though\u2026\" Her voice broke and she buried her face in her palms. \"And now my goddamn car is on the fritz and I'm gonna have to call the tow service or whatever and I'm just so\u2026\" She sucked in a shaky breath. \"Eva, could you switch with Kit?\"\n\n\"You want me to drive?\"\n\n\"Yes, if you don't mind. Kit, could you join me back here?\" my best friend asked softly. \n\n\"Uh\u2026 yeah. Yeah, sure.\" My roommate got out and I slid into the driver's seat in her stead. \n\n\"Where to?\" I inquired, watching Kit uncertainly drape an arm over Nettie's shoulders in the rearview mirror. \n\n\"Can you get me home?\" my savior human's voice meekly rang out from behind me. \n\n\"To your house?\"\n\n\"No, not mine, yours, please. I-I can't go into that house right now.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" I inquired.\n\n\"You wouldn't understand, baby girl.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Uh, Eva? Could you let it go for now?\" my roommate spoke up. \n\n\"Why?\" \n\n\"Because Nettie is having trouble talking right now.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Oh word,\" Kit mumbled defeatedly.\n\nI parked the car outside of our building and accompanied the two of them upstairs. When they sat down on the couch, I moved to join them, but Kit waved me off. \"Actually\u2026 Maybe go to your room for a while.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"It's just that I think Nettie needs to be with someone a little more understanding right now.\"\n\nI looked over at my best friend only to see her nod, not meeting my gaze. I walked right back out the door and kept marching until I ended up at the diner. Somehow, I seem to always wind up there lately. I pushed open the door, stepping over the white tiles when I entered and sat down on a free bench. Frankie Preston had already materialized in front of me when I lifted my head. \"Hey, sunshine.\"\n\n\"What does she even mean? I'm not understanding enough?\" \n\n\"Context?\"\n\n\"My friends don't want me around, apparently.\"\n\n\"Oh. Are you sure? They probably didn't mean that.\"\n\n\"They said it exactly like that.\"\n\nFrankie sighed. \"Well, *I* still want you around. I get off in an hour; if you wait, you could come back home with me and stay over?\"\n\nI said I'd be glad to, so that's what we ended up doing. In the meantime, I got something to eat and then just stared out the window for the most part. When Frankie was ready to leave, we got on the bus outside. It was weird sitting side by side with him. I was looking at him the entire time, and despite what Nettie always says about not staring, he didn't seem to mind. He only leaned over once to zip my jacket shut. \"Still sad?\" he asked softly.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The world sucks ass, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"Today it does. My best friend is upset and I guess me being there would only make it worse. I mean, she'd rather have my roommate with her than me. And I get that she's the one who was unhappy first, but now I feel\u2026 all strange and alone. I had no idea I was such a huge burden.\"\n\n\"You're not the reason she's miserable. She's miserable because the world sucks ass.\"\n\nI hummed in thought, glancing out the window before turning back to him. \"You know what you look like?\"\n\n\"Oh crap, here we go,\" Frankie muttered.\n\n\"You look like these angel figurines they sell around Christmas time. But grown-up. You are so beautiful. Wait, what did you think I was about to say?\"\n\n\"Nevermind. Thanks. That's sweet.\"\n\n\"Anyways, I was just wondering how a Christmas angel could hate everything.\"\n\n\"Not everyone can be a ray of sunshine. And I don't hate *everything*.\" \n\n\"The other day, you asked me if I'd ever consider going on a rampage and destroying all in my path,\" I reminded him.\n\n\"I don't hate the diner, or Rhonda and the other waitresses. And I don't hate *you*. Isn't that enough?\"\n\n\"Of course it's enough. I don't mind it, I just wanna know why.\"\n\n\"I have my reasons.\"\n\nA group of three people got off the bus at the same time as us. The station was a short walk away from Frankie's building. I stuck close to him as we walked. After we'd turned the second corner, I glanced over my shoulder to find that the strangers were still behind us. Tugging on Frankie's sleeve, I whispered, \"Do you know them?\" \n\nHe took a brief, inconspicuous peek, and his back went ramrod straight. \"Oh fuck.\"\n\nMy stomach dropped. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"It's them. It's more of them.\" He reached out to grab my hand, cold fingers stiffly clamping around my own. \"See, this is why the world sucks ass, Evangeline. These guys are why.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo how do we do this?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe gotta lose them somehow\u2026 They can\u2019t find out where I live,\u201d he hissed. \u201cIf they haven't already, what with the first guy showing up there. You saw me then; I was fucking helpless, I wouldn\u2019t be here now if you hadn\u2019t intervened.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do we shake them off?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d His grip on my hand became more forceful. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t panic,\u201d I breathed. \u201cIt\u2019ll be alright; we can do this.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, sunshine,\u201d he muttered. Nothing else. And he sounded utterly hopeless. \n\nI abruptly pulled him around another corner, down a street that led into an entirely different direction from his building. I heard footsteps coming down harder and more frantically behind us. They were catching up with us. My pulse racing, I stole a quick glance at our pursuers. They looked completely normal\u2014two men and one woman, all dressed unobtrusively and nondescript. My heart missed a beat when I locked eyes with with *her*. She looked confused and angry, but most of all, determined. It was that determination that caused my blood to freeze. The memory of the other stranger reaching into Frankie\u2019s open stomach as he lay unconscious forced itself back into my head. I chased it from my mind, clinging to the waiter\u2019s arm as we ran, trying to dodge the passersby in our way. \n\nAfter a few blocks, the three strangers didn\u2019t appear to be behind us anymore. We slowed down and I leaned back against a storefront, tipping my head back to catch my breath. Frankie seemed weirdly unaffected by our sprint. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked, reaching out to adjust my collar. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I can\u2019t believe this is happening again.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d I panted, holding onto his hand when he dropped his arm. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to tell me who these guys are though sooner or later.\u201d\n\n\nHe groaned. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want my help?\u201d\n\n\nHe hung his head. \u201cYes,\u201d he admitted quietly.\n\n\u201cAnd do you want me to trust you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019re gonna have to be more open.\u201d\n\nHe fell silent for a moment. When he spoke up again, a regretful resolve carried along in his tone. \u201cEver hear of a corporation named FunFlair?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a company that owns several other companies that fabricate, um\u2026 *toys* and stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike dolls and plushies and things?\u201d\n\nFrankie snorted. \u201cClose! A-anyways, I used to be\u2026 *affiliated* with one of their developmental departments. I ended up finding out that they were doing some really shitty things. So I fled. And I took others with me. FunFlair lost millions worth of research and property due to the damage we inflicted before leaving. Proudest moment of my life. But the thing is, they want me back\u2014the others, too, but me in particular. Plus, they obviously have it out for me because I started the proverbial fire. If they ever get their hands on me, if they ever take me back to their factories\u2026 that'll be it for me.\u201d\n\nI turned to regard his profile. \u201cAre you being vague on purpose?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. And there\u2019s more than a few white lies in that version. The whole story's more jarring. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019d ever be alright knowing those things about me. So if it\u2019s okay with you, I\u2019d prefer it if you didn\u2019t. Just for the time being. But you\u2019ve got the gist of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine. *For now.*\u201d\n\nI peeked around the back of the store we were lingering in front of. We were still by ourselves, but the queasy feeling in my stomach remained. We started walking again, taking a couple side streets in a roundabout way to return to Frankie\u2019s apartment. The air was colder than it had been in a few days, a salty breeze wafting over from the seaside. The sunlight was bright and cold, and it had me squinting when we arrived outside of his building. After climbing several flights of stairs, we finally found ourselves standing in front of the server\u2019s door. \u201cFuck, I forgot to check the mail\u2026 Do you mind if I go back downstairs real quick?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you let me in first?\u201d\n\nHe handed me the keys and then hurriedly made his way down the hallway while I unlocked the door and entered the apartment. I stepped into the hallway, hung my coat and proceeded into the living room. I had barely crossed the threshold when I was overcome by a strong sense of unease. I felt watched, like someone was standing right behind me. However, I couldn\u2019t quite finish that thought before becoming aware of the cold edge of a blade pressing against the skin of my neck. My stomach turned and I took in a single, shallow breath. I slowly turned my head just a bit so I could see the person crowding my back out of the corner of my eye. It was the woman from before. Her other hand had come up to grip my shoulder. I swallowed thickly, the knifepoint bobbing against my throat. \n\n\u201cQuiet.\u201d Her voice was a steely chill, sending a shiver down my spine. Having been raised by the warmest, kindest human ever, it unnerves me when I hear someone sound *that* emotionless. I suddenly wished desperately for Nettie to be there and hug me. I willed my heart rate to slow.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d the lady hissed into my ear. Her cool breath met the side of my face with an intensely minty smell. \n\n\u201cDo you mean my name, or\u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour name, your affiliation, your relation to the prototype.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Evangeline Shirley, I used to be a delivery driver but am currently unemployed, and I do not know what you mean by prototype.\u201d\n\nA sigh. \u201cLook, you stumbled into something pretty messy here. If there\u2019s a brain in that hair, you\u2019ll walk out of here nice and quiet and not breathe a word about this to *anyone*. Wait until we\u2019re done here, keep still until it\u2019s over, then you can go. Okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the prototype?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of your business. Shut up.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve got questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you that it\u2019s none of your fucking business, now *shut your mouth*,\u201d she growled. Her arm snaked fully around my chest, pulling me flush to hers and shoving me along when she took a step forward, further into the living room. She flung me onto the sofa, kneeling down in front of me when I sat up. The two men who had accompanied her earlier appeared from behind her, having seemingly hidden in the other room before. Their faces were similarly harsh, tension seemingly oozing from their bodies. One of them had pulled a gun, the muzzle hovering halfway in the air in uncertainty, not quite pointing at me but into my general direction. I squirmed in my seat, sweat breaking out on my forehead and a phantom pain creeping into my shoulder as I eyed the weapon. \n\n\u201cFuck,\u201d one of the men groaned. \u201cShe came back with him?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not going to give us grief,\u201d the woman replied, reaching into her pocket to produce a bundle of cable binders which she went on to tie my ankles together. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right?\u201d she asked me.\n\nI would have talked back. I would have loved to kick her right in the face, to send that knife of hers clattering across the floor, to stand upright, but I *couldn\u2019t*. It was that gun. That black, metallic sheen that sent icy dread seeping into my bones as I recalled the sensation of a bullet ripping through my flesh. My gaze remained trained on it, my lips quivering and a distant-sounding ringing in my ears. This thing terrified me into silence.\n\n\u201cWonderful,\u201d the lady muttered, and I became painfully aware of the plastic strips cutting into my skin. \n\n\u201cYou know we can\u2019t let her go, right?\u201d the other man asked. \u201cShe ran away with him before. She\u2019s gotta know *some* things. She\u2019s sure as shit gonna rat us out.\u201d\n\nThe woman snarled. \u201cYou really want this girl\u2019s blood on your hands?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about what we want, it\u2019s what we need to do. If Phil finds out some outsider\u2019s been\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNevermind! Never fucking mind, just\u2026 you finish her. I don\u2019t wanna watch.\u201d She gave me an awkward pat on the knee when she straightened up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m really sorry, okay? But you shouldn\u2019t have gotten mixed up with\u2026 how does he call himself? Frank Preston? It\u2019s on you. Why the hell would you wanna be around him in the first place? I could never look at him without getting the chills.\u201d\n\nThe man raised the gun to aim at my head. \u201cListen, I don\u2019t take any pleasure in this.\u201d\n\nNow or never. My eyes stung when I realized what was about to happen, what I would have to do. The back of my shirt bulged and rode up when my tentacles forced their way out from beneath. My eyes followed the gun as it slid out of the man\u2019s hand and hit the floor, and I hurried to swipe it out of his reach. My feet being bound, I couldn\u2019t really get up. I stayed still on the couch, absently watching my own inhuman limbs tear through flesh, snapping bones and sending blood spattering on the floor. I squealed in pain when the woman sliced at the appendages with her knife. The burning cuts pulled me out of my stupor and back into the moment. I didn\u2019t like this. I didn\u2019t like doing this. I think I was shaking when I broke her neck.\n\nThe struggle lasted merely a few minutes, but somehow, it felt like a full hour. When it was finally over, all I could do was sit still, frozen in place, weirdly focused on how my own chest was rising and falling. Four people in that room and I was the only one left breathing.\n\n\u201cSunshine?\u201d\n\nFrankie had to speak up for me to take note of him. I didn\u2019t know for how long he\u2019d been standing in the doorway, surveying the carnage with parted lips. His gaze met mine in a mix of dread and comprehension. He was at my feet in a heartbeat, fumbling with the cable binders before rushing out of the room and returning with a pair of scissors to cut me free. I rolled my ankles and readjusted my shirt as I got up. \n\n\u201cGod, I need some gum. I was only gone for, like\u2026\u201d His voice trailed off and he shook his head. \u201cAre you okay? Did they hurt you?\u201d\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\u201cYou look really out of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease hug me.\u201d\n\nFrankie readily pulled me to his chest, holding me for several seconds before I patted his shoulder to signal I was ready to be released. \u201cThanks. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am so\u2026 incredibly sorry.\u201d He sucked on his lower lip, turning on his heels to once again look over the blood-soaked mess. \u201cTo think I brought you along to make you feel better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you did. I\u2019d be more upset if they\u2019d gotten to you with no one around to help.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. Holy crap, this is the second time you\u2019ve saved my life, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re not counting the pool-incident. Which we shouldn\u2019t, \u2018cause that was my fault.\u201d\n\nFrankie turned to face me. \u201cEvangeline, you are\u2026\u201d His voice cracked and he shook his head. \u201cYou should go lie down. This\u2019ll be hell to clean up, and I don\u2019t want to bother you with that to boot. Unless of course you want to leave, which is more than reasonable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to stay.\u201d \n\nHe smiled. \u201cBathroom\u2019s down to the left, bedroom is behind that door right there. I\u2019ll be busy here for a little while. Do you want me to wake you up when I\u2019m done?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Wait, you can clean up three whole corpses just like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got my methods. Besides, I, uh, wouldn\u2019t call them *whole*.\u201d\n\nFrankie\u2019s bed was so perfectly made and unwrinkled that it was difficult to imagine him ever actually using it. It was hard, too, though that didn\u2019t bother me all that much. I fell asleep the moment my head hit the pillow, and I stayed that way for two hours. I\u2019m awake now, obviously, but I don\u2019t feel like getting up yet. I killed three people today. Three. I know this isn\u2019t anything I\u2019m a complete stranger to, but still, this was just one day. And there were three of them.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13dr5g0/help_im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[2: deadbeat roommate](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13eovqy/im_stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_also_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[3: creepy crush](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13fnc4u/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_everyone/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[4: relocation](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13gjpwd/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_does_anybody/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[5: beach concert](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13heih5/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[6: First date](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ib2es/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_my_first/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[7: Temp work](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ja7jx/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_temp_work/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[8: roommate talk](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13k8088/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_a_talk_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[10: at the warehouse](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13m8e9w/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

When I was young,  I struggled with empathy and listening to others. I just wanted to jump straight to fix the problem of people I love.  Turns out that sometimes that's not what they want  or need. Sometimes, they just want to be listened to. \n\nYou're very, very good at protecting the people you love, and good at fixing too \ud83d\ude42 Nettie just needs to be listened to by someone who isn't asking logical questions. And we know that Kit isn't the most logical of beings! \n\nThat doesn't mean they don't love you, or that you're a burden. You're not. And if you asked them, I bet they absolutely will tell you the same as I am.\n\nI, for one, am not weirded out by the server being a prototype. He sounds like a great prototype to have!

He's holding something valuable to FunFlair (there was that guy cutting him up searching for *something*). Frankie has a secret that he wants to keep which explains why he's being vague.

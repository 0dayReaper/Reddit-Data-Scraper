    "postText": "Before i start, i feel like i should let something very clear: I absolutely love Ellen. We've been living together for about three years now, but have known each other our whole lives. In fact, we were childhood friends - and i know this may sound like a fairy tale to some people, but it truly felt like we were always destined to be together. Even after graduation, when we started dating other people, it only felt truly right when we were with each other. So i don't know what took me so long to ask her out, but i'm really glad i did.\n\nWe have the same taste in music, movies, and even food. We laugh at the same dumb jokes, and know exactly how to comfort each other in times of need. She's the kindest, most gentle and loving girl i ever met. We even been talking about our plans for marriage, and how we would like to have kids of our own. That's why it hurts so much how it all went terribly wrong, in just four nights.\n\nI would also like to preface that Ellen doesn't have much of a family other than me, and some very distant aunts that she never met and doesn't even know their names. I was born in a big family, with four siblings and plenty of cousins that were always visiting, and even helping out when we got in trouble. Ellen has none of that. She doesn't have any siblings, and her father was an alcoholic, abusive freak that died when she was young. Her mother was a very kind and inspiring person, that took care of the family by herself for many years. And almost a second mother to myself. So when she passed away last year, it hurt us both for a long time.\n\nBut Ellen stayed strong. She's not the type to let her feelings easily surface, so you gotta be a lot more perceptive to get what she truly feels. I used to proud myself in being capable of that. I felt like i knew her better than i knew myself. That's why this is all so strange, and frankly, terrifying.\n\nWe were sleeping in bed, and i was dreaming. I don't really remember what it was about, but for some reason i'm sure of it. Until i heard her voice, very close to my ear:\n\n*''Knock, knock. Knock, knock.''*\n\nShe was caressing my hair, gently, while sitting in bed and looking below at me.\n\nI slowly opened my eyes, groggy from sleep.\n\n''Hey... what is it, baby?''\n\nShe kept looking at me, fixated. And repeated:\n\n*''Knock, knock. Knock, knock.''*\n\nI glanced at the digital clock, on top of the dresser. *3:27 AM.* I had work in only a few hours.\n\n''What is it, Ellen?''\n\nShe paused. - ''Please answer the joke, dear. *Knock, knock. Knock, knock.''*\n\n''Fine.'' - I accepted, mostly because i was expecting some kind of surprise. Ellen wasn't the type to do what she was doing for no reason. - ''Who's there?''\n\nHer smile opened up, and she answered: ''*Not me. So don't answer the door.''*\n\nI kept looking at her, dumbfounded. What was that supposed to mean?\n\n''Is that it? Is that the joke?''\n\n''Yes'' - She said, laying in the couch and covering herself with a blanket. - ''Thank you for answering.''\n\n''Weirdo.'' - I answered, closing my eyes and going back to sleep.\n\nNext morning, things went as usual. I only remembered the strange conversation while i was alone in the bathroom, brushing my teeth, and wasn't even sure if it had truly happened or if it was just a weird dream. So we had our breakfast together, and she was acting normal, reading something aloud from a fashion magazine. Frankly, i wasn't paying much attention. So i took the opportunity to ask about last night.\n\nInitially, she didn't seem to know what i was talking about. Then her eyes fixated on me and the same smile from last night crossed her face, briefly. And i knew it wasn't just a dream. She told me it wasn't anything of importance, and stopped paying attention when i asked more inquisitively. And even though i shouldn't, i gave up. I had work and other matters to attend to, and just brushed off the weird event thinking it wouldn't happen again.\n\nBut the following night, i woke up to her voice.\n\n*''Knock, knock.'' -* A pause. - ''*Knock.''*\n\n''What is it now?'' - I said. - ''Ellen, what are you doing?''\n\n*''Knock, knock. Knock.'' -* She repeated.\n\nThis time, she wasn't even touching me. Just sitting in bed, looking at me with that same smile. But her eyes semeed larger, and she blinked in longer intervals. I looked at the clock. Once again, *3:27 AM.*\n\n''Ellen, c'mon. What is it? I got work in a few hours, can't have the luxury of waking up in the middle of the night to answer Knock Knock jokes.''\n\n''*Knock, Knock. Knock.''*\n\n''This is getting creepy, you know? I'm not sure if this is some gag you've been doing, but i don't like it.''\n\n''Answer it. *Knock, Knock. Knock.''*\n\nI sighed, but also let a small laugh escape. It was creepy, of course, but she was also my Ellen. So it didn't bother me as much as it should.\n\n''Fine. Who the fuck is there?'' - I answered in a playful tone.\n\n''*Not me. So don't answer the door.''*\n\nFor some reason, i felt a chill down in my spine. It was the same answer as before, and i still didn't get what it meant. But the way she said it, with a strange, monotone voice, contrasted well with her smile and the fact that i had no idea of what she meant by that.\n\n''What does that mean?'' - I asked. - ''I really don't get it.''\n\nShe just smiled, and went back to sleep. I felt a throb in my heart, but did the same.\n\nNext day, we talked again about what was happening. She was very evasive with my questions, and i barely got her to say anything. It was almost as if she couldn't talk about it, which was very strange, considering we talk about pretty much everything. I told her i needed to be well rested for work, something she should understand well, and wasn't liking her little gag every night. She just nodded. And i decided to not press further, as i didn't want to hurt her feelings and had work to attend to.\n\nWhen i got back home, we had dinner, watched a movie and went to bed.\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\nI opened my eyes faster this time around. In fact, i barely got any sleep - i just knew she would do it again and kept thinking about it the whole time. Glanced at the clock: *3:27 AM.*\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\nI thought about ignoring her. Just pretending i was asleep and she wouldn't wake me up. So i closed my eyes slowly, hoping that she hadn't seen me opening them in the first place, and stayed quiet.\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\nShe continued. She didn't stop. I regulated my breathing, but she kept going.\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\n''I'm not answering your fucking joke, Ellen. Stop it.''\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\nI ignored but she kept going. She had never been this insistent with anything before. I tried to ignore it, but it was getting on my nerves, and frankly, i felt scared. Why was Ellen doing this? Why every night, at the same exact time down to the minute? Why wouldn't she let me sleep until i answered her?\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\nI got up in a sudden movement.\n\n''God dammit, Ellen.'' - I was ready for a discussion, but when i finally glanced at her, it was as if the strength was drained from me.\n\nShe wasn't smiling. She wasn't blinking. Just staring right at me, fixated like an animal. And her mouth was moving, slowly, and she didn't stop. ''*Knock, Knock''.*\n\nI didn't know how to react, or what expression i had when i saw her but my heart skipped a beat. It was terrifying, as if her gaze froze me in place. A thousand-yard stare.\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\n''Who's there?'' - I asked, feeling as if it was the only way out of that nightmare.\n\n*''Not me. So don't answer the door'' -* She said, weakly.\n\nEllen slowly closed her eyes and layed down. I kept staring at her while she fell into what seemed to be a deep sleep.\n\nI got up and and left. I walked downstairs and sat down at the couch in the living room, staring at the night sky outside and absorbing the quiet of the neighborhood. My heart was beating fast and it didn't slow down. I was too scared to sleep in the same room as my girlfriend, all because of a fucking Knock Knock joke. But it was unnatural. I thought about calling someone. I thought about it all being some kind of sleep-related issue, such as some type of sleep-walking. But it didn't make any sense.\n\nI felt so tired. And decided that early in the morning, i would call an old friend who's a psychologist and get the opinion of a professional. Something was wrong with Ellen.\n\nI stayed in the couch as the day rose, and once Ellen woke up, she was acting normal again. Even asked me why i wasn't in bed. I didn't answer. In fact, i didn't speak to her and simply left for work. She seemed very upset, but i wouldn't do anything about it. Once i got to work i called my friend, told him everything that was happening in as much detail as i'm describing now. He didn't seem as worried as i figured, but we agreed in making an appointment for next week. Now i just needed to convince Ellen to come with me.\n\nI received plenty of text messages from her. She seemed very worried, sad and even confused. She apologized a lot, and it broke my heart a little. I felt bad. I shouldn't have, but i answered her, and made her promise it wouldn't happen again. I also told her about the appointment, and she seemed reluctant but agreed to go with me. So we made up.\n\nThis was Ellen, after all. The girl i knew ever since i was six years old. The woman i loved and that had taken care of me for years. And as much as that strange behaviour creeped me out, she wasn't doing anything particularly frightening, or even dangerous. So for a brief while, i convinced myself i should give her another chance.\n\nWhen i returned home from work, we stayed together. She even prepared my favorite meal. Ellen was acting as gentle and caring as i always remembered, and i slept with her in our bedroom, even though i was still a bit reluctant.\n\n*''Knock''*\n\nI couldn't believe it. She promised me she wouldn't.\n\n*''Knock''*\n\nI gazed at the clock. *3:27 AM.* Always.\n\n*''Knock''*\n\nI was laying on my stomach and i couldn't see her face. In fact, i didn't even bother to look at her. I was feeling more sad than scared, at that point. Sad that she had broken her word.\n\n*''Knock''*\n\n''Who's there?'' - I answered, determined to just go back to sleep.\n\n*''Not me. So don't answer the door.''*\n\nI stayed quiet and closed my eyes. I just hoped i would be able to handle it until the appointment next week.\n\nTo my surprise, i was actually able to sleep. Probably because i hadn't been able to rest since last night. The following morning, i went back to not saying anything to Ellen, only very limited responses. I was expecting her to act same as yesterday, trying to apologize, but she didn't. Mostly she didn't say anything, almost as if she had accepted it. She also looked tired, or at least a bit weak.\n\nI went to work, but i couldn't stop thinking about her. Didn't receive any messages either. Once i got back, we had the most silent dinner i ever had in my life. And she barely ate anything.\n\nI decided to let her have the bedroom and sleep on the couch. I wasn't sure if it would stop her, but held on to the hope that she wouldn't go downstairs only to tell me the same Knock Knock joke again. I covered myself with a blanket, shaked off that uneasy feeling and tried to sleep.\n\nI had a deep sleep, without dreams. Felt like i was lost in darkness. Then i heard breathing.\n\nOpened my eyes to see Ellen, standing above me, looking at me with big, fixated eyes and dilated pupils that didn't seem to belong in such a completly neutral expression. Watching me sleep.\n\nI almost screamed in terror. Jumped out of the couch, and her eyes followed me as i stumbled through the dark room, creating distance between us. For a moment i was able to glance at the clock above the table: *3:27 AM.*\n\n''Ellen, what are you doing?!'' - I asked, desperate. But she didn't move.\n\nIn fact, she didn't say anything. Just stared at me, as if i was made of glass and she could see right through me.\n\nThen i heard a knock on the front door.\n\nInstinctively, i looked in that direction. It was followed by another knock. And another. Someone almost pounding at the door.\n\nI glanced back at Ellen, and she was still staring at me. Slowly, i got closer to the door and she didn't move. The pounding continued.\n\n''Who's there?!'' - I screamed.\n\nIt stopped. And then, i heard a voice.\n\n''John? John, can you hear me? Open the door, please! John, please open the door!''\n\nI froze in place. The voice kept calling me. But i couldn't believe it. It was Ellen's voice, coming from the other side of the door. But it couldn't be.\n\n''I beg you, John! Open the door, it's serious! She's not me, i swear! She's not me!''\n\nSlowly i turned my head to look at Ellen, standing in front of the couch. She was looking at me, the same fixated eyes and a terrible, wide grin across her face.\n\nThe pounding continued. ''John, open the door! Please, you have to trust me!''\n\nI stayed still, not knowing what to do. And i don't remember what happened after that.\n\nI just woke up in my bedroom. The digital clock indicates it's *4:21 AM.* Ellen isn't by my side, i'm completly alone. I'm trembling, uncontrollably and i don't know what's going on. I don't remember what happened after i saw her terrible grim. I don't know if i opened the door.\n\nI tried to look for my phone, see if i could call the police, or at least someone that i know. But i left it downstairs. All i have is Ellen's laptop, and it's where i'm writing this right now, to get advice. Because i can't go downstairs. The corridor is dark, very dark, almost as if the shadows were leaning into the room. And i can hear a faint, scratching sound coming from below.\n\nWhat should i do?",

This would also explain why you hear Ellen knocking on the actual door at that same time on the final night. After a certain point, there is more monster than Ellen, and so Ellen can can only try and access you under the same rules as the monster, at 3:27. Every night Ellen became less herself, right? Because you kept answering. This would mean that the real Ellen is on the other side of the door. You had already broken the rules by answering each night. You answered the door.

Whereas it might actually be the real one outside, and the thing woke him up everytime at 3:27 to make him think it wasn't normal",

Based on the hovering, grinning, and silence on that last night, all discomfort and despair was fully intentional on \u201cEllen\u2019s\u201d behalf, which implies that answering the door in itself was taking the baited hook.\n\nOf course these only track if that was the bit and it wasn\u2019t \u201creal Ellen\u201d at the door. In which case, if it was, what purpose would her replacement have getting OP worried about it, and then _not_ doing anything but being creepy when the time came? Wouldn\u2019t this be prime time for her/it to turn up the acting knob and insist on being the real Ellen?

You must fight your fear, walk right up to her and give a long passionate kiss like your life depended on it to wake her up from the nightmare. This is Ellen, your eternal soul mate, the one and only true  love of your life. It's worth a try.\n\nOtherwise, from what I can deduce, is that you should open the door because I personally believe that's the real Ellen. Each night had one knock less. The lesser the knocks the weirder she became. It was likely every time you responded to the joke, the more of the real Ellen gets booted out of her own body to be overtaken by some unknown entity.",

Although I did facepalm as soon as he answered her the second time. Chick literally said \"Not me, so don't answer\" and dumbdumb kept answering. \n\nI think its truly about the choice he had to make, but the answering could've been giving the imposter strength as well. Either that or it was wearing the real Ellen down doing this every night, and finally locked her out on the fourth night. Which would mean the real her was outside, and the creepy fake was watching him sleep. Ugghhh.\n\nWhich, btw, that \"not me\" sentence alone made my heart drop. I'd be freaked the fuck out if my boyfriend said that shit at all, let alone 3am. My nosleep and all things paranormal-obsessed brain went straight to, \"Ah fuck an imposter is gonna knock on the door and he's gonna stupidly answer it like she didn't specifically pull this weird shit and timing to subconsciously make him hesitate.\" After the ending though, I'm not sure if real Ellen was outside, and the fake one did this as a game or what. Surely if the imposter just shut up and let \"ellen\" knock, OP would open the door to some perma-evil if that was the plan. Why try to make him not answer, unless the real one was actually outside?",

If that's the real Ellen then she's hiding something, maybe the thing is threatening her and she can't tell the truth.\n\nThen why would the thing(Ellen inside) condition him to think that an imposter would come by at 3:27, for him not to answer, but since she's acting so suspicious, it pushes the person to want to answer as you normally would anyways. Like if Ellen is evil then she should make him believe that she's normal and not scare him so bad.\n\nIt would make sense for normal Ellen to want him not to answer if she knew something was wanting to enter but then why act all creepy ?\n\nMAYBE the creepy Ellen inside is just Ellen sleep walking, and her subconscious is taking over to protect him and she didnt mean to smile creepily or to scare him. That's the most credible explaination to me. That would explain why she brushed it off everyday because she didn't actually know what was up, she wasn't doing it consciously.",

Isn't it better to put some sleeping pills in the guys meal just to ensure he wouldn't wake up? What i think happened, is the girl is channeling the other dimension and someone, maybe the girls dead mother, is trying to protect them, by showing them that they shouldn't open the door to someone who sounds like Ellen. Also this is a very cliche thing to do among the demons, to sound like someone you know or care about.

As evidence, notice how each time OP answered the joke, their wife became weaker and quieter until the incident occurred. This shows that the real wife, who he saw in the morning, was getting weakened by the imposter\u2019s influence that was growing each time the joke (and therefore, the \u201cdoor\u201d) was answered.",

Ellen has to be partially aware this is going on, even if she hasn't pieced it all together, and she wonders if she's literally going crazy, having a psychotic break with reality. She's afraid, not only of this condition, but of losing OP's love. \n\nThe invader is only able to teleport into Ellen's body at 3:27 a.m. , probably for a limited time, which is over by breakfast when OP questions her about the previous night. Or perhaps the visitor still had some limited control of Ellen at this time, enough to stop Ellen from answering questions. \n\nThe question is, who is this person visiting her body, whose body her mind gets thrown into? What does she see and do in that body? Ellen isn't a witch or master of body switching, so she probably isn't very skilled at controlling another. The visitor must anticipate that Ellen-in-their-body is getting close to making it home, and due to their switching bodies at 3:27 AM, that's around the time Ellen's mind in witch's body is going to arrive home. She will tell OP to separately ask her and the person in her body things only the real Ellen could know, and thus prove that the body swapping is real. It's tricky because it's possible that the invader could swap bodies back at any time. \n\nOr rather than black magick, this could be science-based, maybe a scheme to stay young like in \"Get Out\" or \"Being John Malkovich\" or a variation on \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\". \n\nThe way it ends \"what should I do?\" plays like a choose-your-own-adventure book, an Infocom game, or that interminable Bandersnatch episode. \n\nSorry OP, I didn't mean to make your dire situation sound like trivial entertainment. If I were you, I'd open that door and hear what the person claiming to be Ellen has to say. But also you need to figure out whether this is being caused by spiritual, scientific, or alien power! How you deal with this problem and prevent anything else from happening could differ greatly depending on which of those it is...",

Something controls Her to give You advice that there's real Danger outside knocking.   \nI would do something random, like, when she says 'Knock Knock', just Kiss her and stare at her and say 'Not Me.''  \nGotta say, some Demonic ententies are weird.   \n...  \nOh Who am I kidding, they're all weird and a lot just want to Fuck with You, even if they aren't Evil.   \nI had quite some interactions with a Demonic beings and... They're all weirdos, but they fear and respect Me for just being random with my reactions and other things I've done so far.  \nI still would do that with the Kiss and see, it might be a translucent state and she wakes up, knowing the answer, or it overwhelms the being making it uncomfortable and it leaves.   \n...  \nAlso, for those who wonder about the Guy who posted the Story, his last post was from a day ago, just check his Profil, don't be silly folks.",

My friends mom was an exorcist of sorts, not by choice. It's not like she was super religious or anything. She told me a story of an experience she had that was pretty similar to yours back in the 70's. She explained it was as if that experience opened a door that couldn't be closed. From that point on she would see paranormal shit frequently, normally between the hours of 3am and 4am. I had a hard time believing it until I mentioned it to my friend and he reluctantly confirmed he also witnessed shadow people in the middle of the night. She would cast them out of the house with a Bible like it was normal. He never told anyone about it because he realized how unbelievable it is and didn't want to sound crazy. From that moment I've been more open minded to the possiblity of the unknown instead of instantly dismissing something because of my lack of understanding or ignorance on the subject. That being said, if this is in fact a true story I wish you and your love the best.",

    "postText": "I recently moved into a new house in a quiet Suburban area. I\u2019m not going to say where because it\u2019s had it\u2019s fair share of media coverage, and teens showing up at night trying to get a glimpse inside the infamous house.\n\nIt had been on the market for three-years, and I secured the house at a much cheaper price due to the fact that two people had been found murdered there.\n\nThe mystery and brutality of the murders catapulted the story into the local news. No specific details were released to the public, and I only found out about it because a friend of mine is a local realtor with connections.  \n\nNobody was ever arrested for the murders. A male in his thirties was found in the living area, and a female in her thirties was found barricaded in the basement. Another mysterious fact was that the woman had barricaded herself in from the inside, in a desperate attempt to stop someone or something from getting in. \n\nYesterday whilst doing some cleaning in the basement, I came across a cell phone that had fallen down a gap behind the washing machine and the wall.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a voice recording on it.\n\nRecorded the same night of the murders by the female victim. And, It\u2019s pretty terrifying. I\u2019ve already handed it into the police, but I made a transcript of the recording.\n\nWhat you are about to read is the unedited transcript of the cell phone recording found in the basement. \n\nI have to admit, it\u2019s extremely disturbing. The desperation in her voice will haunt me forever. \n\nHere goes.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re hearing this, please, please, please give it the police. My husband is dead, it killed him. I\u2019m so sorry Scott.\n\nI can hear it now, upstairs, looking for a way in, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before it finds one.\n\nI\u2019ve barricaded myself in the basement and I\u2019ve got my eyes on the only door, one way in one way our.\n\nYou see, it can\u2019t move if you\u2019re looking at it. \n\nIt began twelve weeks ago.  The night Scott, my childhood sweetheart and husband of five-years confessed that he\u2019d had a drunken one-night stand on his bachelor party in Europe.  The apparent guilt had consumed him for the past five-years, and his sudden urge to be truthful was due to the fact we were due to get married this same year. \n\nHis words hit me like a freight train, and the urge to vomit washed over me like a tsunami.  I stormed out of the house, our house that we\u2019d bought together twelve-years prior.  I felt like the world had swallowed me whole, and in a way, it had. \n\nI was struck with a throbbing chest pain that rapidly spread down my entire right side.  The pain intensified, taking my breath away, and I stumbled into a tree to steady myself as I felt my body about to faint.\n\nThen darkness. \n\nThe next thing I remember, was waking up in a dark and dismal forest, devoid of colour.  The air was dry and had a distinctive, malodorous smell, like rotten meat or that of a decaying carcass.  But worst of all, was a terrifying feeling that I\u2019d never experienced before, and one that I pray I\u2019ll never feel again.\n\nThe feeling of absolute hopelessness. \n\nThe sky was dull and cloudless, and was ripped apart by soundless, ferocious lightning that illuminated the bleak landscape I found myself in.  I felt like I\u2019d been wandering for hours, maybe even days when I came across a decaying cave.  Animal bones crushed beneath my feet as I made my way towards it. \n\nAs I approached the cave, the putrid smell grew with intensity causing me to retch, and I was violently sick, bringing up my own stomach bile.  The entrance was made of crumbling stone and was completely opaque.  I threw a small stone into it and heard it ricocheting down the stone steps and off the walls.  The silenced lighting strobed the area, and I was able to glimpse into the cave and see a few descending steps.  \n\nThen, two yellow reptilian-like eyes flashed in the darkness. \n\nI stumbled backwards, and just as the lightning struck, I was forcefully thrown by an unseen force.  The lighting flashed continuously, accompanied by a gale-force wind, tossing me around like a rag doll. My eyes were fixed on the cave, and I crippled in terror, as a pale, gangly hand reached around the crumbling stone.  Another flash hurled me hard against a tree, and suddenly -\n\nI woke up in the back of an ambulance with paramedics hovering over me with a defibrillator, and two words that sent a cold and grotesque shiver through my spine. \n\n\u201cWelcome back\u201d. \n\nWelcome back?  Back from where?  What was that place?  That thing in the cave?  How long was I gone?  \n\nHundreds of questions raced through my mind, but none of which I had the answer for.  \n\nNot yet anyway. \n\n\u201cYou died in the back of that ambulance\u201d the doctor said as I lay in a bed in the ICU. \n\nThe room tilted as I tried to digest what the doctor was telling me.  I felt like I was in a nightmare that I couldn\u2019t wake up from.  I\u2019m thirty-years old, I eat healthily, and I run four times a week, how could this be happening to me?\n\nMy scans revealed I\u2019d inherited a faulty gene and developed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and suffered a cardiac arrest.  I spent the next seven-weeks in the ICU and told nobody of the dark forest and the creature with the yellow eyes.  Just the thought of that place was enough to raise the hairs on the back of my neck. \n\nMy mother practically moved into the hospital.  Fussing over me like mothers do.  She blamed herself for my condition, even though her scans were clear, meaning that I inherited the faulty gene from my absent father.  \n\nMy husband Scott came on the first day, but I asked him for space.  I needed some time to heal and process everything that had happened, about both my condition, and his infidelity.  Although he kept that promise, he would call my mom every day to check on me, to make sure I was okay.\n\nI wasn\u2019t.\n      \nNot because of my condition, but for something else. \n\nI\u2019d started to see something. \n\nI wasn\u2019t sure what it was at first.  It started as a tiny dot in my peripheral, nothing more than a spec on my retina.  Of course, I had my eyes checked, but all results came back clear, as did the results for my visual cortex.  \n\nDays later, what started as a dot in my peripheral began to grow.\n\nThe first time I saw it, I was at my doctor\u2019s office.  He had left me alone for a moment whilst he consulted with my surgeon.  It was dark outside and the sound of heavy rain pit-a-patting against the glass was hypnotic. I stared out of the window, watching as a small handful of people came in and out of the hospital.  \n\nThen, my eyes were drawn to an ominous silhouette at the far end of the parking lot.  I couldn\u2019t make out any distinguishing features due to the minimal light, but there was something there, standing deadly still in the shadows.  \n\nA car horn broke my reverie, a man was getting into his truck in the lot and must have pressed the horn by accident.  I turned back to the silhouette, and it was in a completely different position.  \n\nIt had moved.\n\nIt was standing eerily still again, but like it had frozen mid-walk.  I could just about make out its elongated limbs, like it\u2019s arms and legs had been stretched out.  \n\nThe doctor returned momentarily, startling me.  He\u2019d gotten my scans, and everything was how it should be.\n\n\u201cGood news, you should be okay to be discharged in a few days\u201d he said.  \n\nThat was great news, I was so ready to get out of the hospital.  I turned back to the window in curiosity, but whatever I saw had gone.  \n\nI didn\u2019t think about it again until the night before I was going home.  It was late and most of the patients were sleeping.  My room is situated at the end of the hall, so I get a clear view of it through my observation window.  I wasn\u2019t quite ready to go to sleep and was watching something on my iPad.\n\nSuddenly, there was a putrid odour wafting in through my open door.  The same unmistakable smell that I\u2019d experienced in that \u2018other place\u2019.  Two nurses walked past my room, neither showing any signs that they too could smell it.  I covered my nose and mouth to try and stop me from heaving. \n\nThen, my eyes drifted to the observation window, and to the corridor. \n\nIt was here again.  The silhouette.\n\nAt the far end of the hall.  Completely still, with its back pressed up against the wall.  But I could see it.  It was tall and skinny, and had either feelers or tentacles stretched up against the wall like an ink spill.  Its daunting yellow eyes stared straight at me. \n\nI saw another nurse walk up the hall and straight past it, like it wasn\u2019t there.  Maybe it wasn\u2019t.  Maybe visual hallucinations were a symptom of what I\u2019d been through, or maybe it was a side effect of the many meds I was taking.  I closed my eyes and took a deep breath.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing there, there\u2019s nothing there, it isn\u2019t real\u201d I whispered to myself. \n\nI opened my eyes and, it hadn\u2019t gone.\n\nIt had moved closer.  \n\nHalfway down the hall.  It had dropped onto all fours like a large dog.  Starring straight at me.  Its long tentacles spread across the floor and up the wall. \n\nI was absolutely petrified.  \n\nI moved over to the window, tentatively.  The smell that resonated from this creature was overpowering.  I watched it for a few moments, until a nurse walked past the window, startling me.  And, like before, when I looked back, it wasn\u2019t there.  It was as though I\u2019d imagined it.  I climbed back into bed, but I didn\u2019t sleep a wink that night. \n\nThe next morning, my mom came to pick me up.  I left with a suitcase of medication and instructions on how and when to take them.  I didn\u2019t tell my mom or anyone at the hospital about my hallucinations.  I was worried If I did say something, the doctors wouldn\u2019t let me leave.  \n\nI had decided to stay at my mom\u2019s until I was ready to talk with Scott.  He brought a box over with some essentials, like my comfy clothes, pyjamas, and my own toothbrush as I\u2019d been using a cheap store bought one up to now.  He was sorry, and it was clear he hadn\u2019t been sleeping.  He said he\u2019d wait for me until I was ready to talk.  I missed both him and our home so much, but I just wasn\u2019t ready to talk about it.  Not yet. \n\nMy mom suggested that I go into town, see the locals, get some fresh air into my lungs.  She offered to drive me, and then we would meet back up at the car after an hour.\n\nWhilst in town, I noticed a poster for the yearly travelling fairground in a storefront window.  I have fond memories growing up of this fair.  It\u2019s where Scott and I shared our first kiss.  We were halfway round the Ferris wheel, when it started to rain.  He covered us with his jacket, and then he kissed me.  This was the moment I knew I\u2019d fallen in love with him.  I was flooded with happy emotions, and it felt right that I text Scott.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready to talk, I\u2019ll be at the place where we shared our first kiss at 8 tonight, Chloe x\u201d. \n\nHe replied almost instantly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there, thank you x\u201d.\n\nAfter a quick smile to myself, I went for a walk through the local market.  It was bustling with energy.  Vendors selling local, fresh produce, handmade furniture, bakeries, and plenty more. \n\nAfter browsing the stalls, I was hit with that smell.  That horrific, nauseating smell.  And I felt the hairs on my arms prickle up.  \n\nI knew it was here.  Somewhere.  Observing me.\n\nMy eyes narrowed as I scanned the area.  I weaved in and out of the locals looking for it.  Paranoia struck me like lightning.  I was bumping into people as I went.  All eyes had now turned to me.  I burst into tears, sprinted back to the lot and leaped into my mother\u2019s car.  \n\nI was sitting in the passenger seat crying my eyes out.  I looked out of the window and saw my mother rushing back to the car shouting my name.  Someone must have told her about my freak out. \n\nI looked out of the opposite window and, IT WAS THERE, standing on top of a vehicle several cars over! \n\n\u201cGET AWAY FROM ME\u201d I screamed. \n\nMy mother whipped open the door.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?  What happened?\u201d she replied.\n\nShe couldn\u2019t see it.  Nobody could.  I told her that I\u2019d had a panic attack.  I hadn\u2019t been around people outside of the hospital for a few months and I felt overwhelmed.  She knew I wasn\u2019t being truthful, but it\u2019s the only answer I could give.\n\nThat night I decided to go ahead and meet Scott at the fair.  When I saw him waiting for me by the Ferris wheel, my heart felt hole again, if only for a moment.  We got our tokens and went on the wheel.  We talked as we went round, about how sorry he was and how much of an idiot he\u2019d been, which I agreed with.\n\nEverything was going well until I saw the creature again.  Standing on top of the ghost house attraction.  Watching me.\n\nI kept my eyes on the figure whilst grabbing Scott\u2019s arm.\n\n\u201cDo you see it?\u201d I asked with a shaky voice. \n\n\u201cSee what?\u201d he replied. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s standing right there, on top of the ghost house\u201d.\n\nI could see him squinting to look, but I knew deep down that he wouldn\u2019t be able to see it, because only I could. \n\n\u201cSweetheart, there\u2019s nobody there, look at me\u201d he replied, calmly. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t\u201d I said solemnly.  \u201cIf I look away, it\u2019ll move\u201d. \n\n\u201cChloe, look at me, there\u2019s nothing there\u201d he said, as he grabbed my chin and turned my face towards his.\n\n\u201cNo!  it\u2019ll move, it wants me to look away\u201d I screamed.\n\nI quickly spun round, my eyes darting back to the ghost house, but it wasn\u2019t there.  I looked around, anxiously, Scott looking on with worry.\n\n\u201cShit, where is it?\u201d  My anxiety palpable.\n\nI looked down, and it was at the bottom of the Ferris wheel.  It had moved inhumanly fast.  I screamed and almost fell out of the carriage, but Scott held onto me. \n\n\u201cHey, hey, I got you, what is it?\u201d  he said, desperately trying to keep hold of me. \n\nI stood up in a panic, rocking the carriage, Scott tried to hang onto me, but it was too late, and I plummeted twenty feet to the ground.  \n\nThe last thing I remember, was Scott screaming for an ambulance. \n\nI was fortunate enough to only suffer a sprained wrist and a slight concussion.  My doctor wanted to keep me in overnight for observations, which I reluctantly agreed to. \n\nI decided to confide in Scott.  I told him everything.  From the cave in the forest to this creature that\u2019s stalking me.  This monstrous entity that must have crawled out of the pits of hell.  And worst of all, it\u2019s getting closer to me. \n\nHe could see that I was terrified, and instead of trying to explain away what I was experiencing, he just held me.  And, for the first time in a long time, I felt safe.  We spent hours just holding each other.  He offered to stay the night, to stay awake in the chair whilst I got some sleep, but I couldn\u2019t have him doing that. \n\nAfter Scott left, I managed to get a few hours rest.  I woke up just after two AM and grabbed my bottle of water from the nightstand.  That\u2019s when I noticed the door was closed, even though I specifically requested it to stay open. \n\nAnd then, there was that horrendous smell.  I knew it was close. \n\nIt was in the fucking room.\n\nIt was crouched down in the corner on all fours, blending into the darkness, watching me.  I desperately tried to scream but no sound would come out.\n\nKeeping my eyes on it, I slowly climbed out of the bed with my back pressed firmly against the wall.  I knew it couldn\u2019t move if I didn\u2019t look away.  I side-stepped along the wall towards the door.  \n\nI started to manoeuvre around a set of drawers, knocking something off that caught my eye for a millisecond.  But that\u2019s all it took.  It was now standing on its two legs.\n\nIt must have been eight-feet tall with outstretched limbs.  A streak of moonlight illuminated part of it\u2019s pale-blue face.  Its yellow eyes glistened in the light.  Its slimy tentacles spread up the wall and onto the roof.  \n\nI kept my back to the wall and kept moving.  I made it to the door, grabbed the door handle, but it was fucking locked.  I kicked the door, but nobody could hear me.\n\nI could see the key for the door on the table in my peripheral.  I fumbled around on the table without looking.  I grabbed everything but the key.  I knew I had to look to find the key. \n\nI quickly glanced to my left \u2013 Saw the key \u2013 Looked back, and the creature was point-blank in front of me.  Reaching out for my throat, its black, curved talon had pierced my neck and blood trickled down.  \n\nSomehow, I managed to scream and within seconds two orderlies had barged through the door.  All they found was me, alone with blood trickling down my neck.  I barged straight past them and ran as fast as I could out of the hospital.\n\nI ended up running all the way home.  I banged as loud as I could on the door, forgetting that it was almost three-thirty in the morning.  Scott answered the door in his pyjamas with a worried look plastered across his face.\n\nI told him what had happened at the hospital whilst he bandaged my neck.\n\n\u201cSee, this is proof that what I\u2019m seeing is real, this is physical proof, you believe me, right, you have to?\u201d I barked. \n\nAfter a momentary pause, he replied:\n\n\u201cYes, I believe you.  I believe...  I believe you\u2019re seeing something\u201d. \n\nI registered the pause, and the hesitation in his voice.  He didn\u2019t believe me, and I didn\u2019t blame him.\n\nAfter talking for a few hours, I had calmed down enough that I told Scott to get some sleep.  He was reluctant to leave me, so he took a nap in the chair.  I grabbed my laptop and searched the web for anything related to what was happening to me.  \n\nThere\u2019re thousands of incidents across the world relating to haunted houses, demons, cults, and possessions, but none that was specific to the entity that was stalking me. \n\nEvery time I heard a sound, a car outside or a floorboard creek I jumped.  I was a nervous wreck.  I went into the kitchen to grab a glass of water.  I looked out of the window into the darkness, expecting to see it watching me.  But it wasn\u2019t. \n\nI went back into the room, and \u2013\n\nIT WAS THERE!\n\nI dropped the glass, and it shattered on the floor.  Scott leaped from the chair. \n\n\u201cWhat, what is it?\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t speak.  My lips were glued shut.  I slowly raised my hand and pointed at it.  It was standing at the far end of the room.  I kept my eyes on it the entire time.  Scott rushed over to me. \n\n\u201cHey, Chloe, there\u2019s nothing their sweetheart, whatever you\u2019re seeing isn\u2019t real\u201d.\n\nHe headed towards it. \n\n\u201cNO, SCOTT, PLEASE DON\u2019T!\u201d I pleaded, as I grabbed his arm.\n\nHe shrugged it off and marched over to it. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing here, I\u2019m going to prove it to you\u201d he said. \n\nHe cocked his arm back and swung his fist, only his arm stopped mid-swing.\n\nHE HIT THE FUCKING CREATURE!\n\nI moved to grab Scott and stood bare foot on the broken shards of glass, cutting my feet, I screamed out, and for a split second, I LOOKED DOWN.\n\nAnd that\u2019s all it took.\n\nWhen I looked up, the creature had already grabbed Scott and folded him in half like a piece of paper.  The sound of his spine breaking echoed through the room.  Scott laid dead on the floor, his eyes widen open and looking at me. \n\nI screamed and backed away into the kitchen.  I slammed the door shut and ran to the rear door.  It was locked and I\u2019d left my keys in my bag in the front room.  I noticed Scott\u2019s cell on the countertop, so I grabbed it and ran down into the basement. \n\nI shut the door and pushed the spare fridge in front of it.  And then I hid in the corner.  Crouched down beside the washing machine.\n\nWhich is where I am now.  Hiding.  Crying.  I can\u2019t call anyone because Scott\u2019s cell doesn\u2019t have a signal down here, which is why I\u2019m recording this message on his cell in the hopes that someone will hear my story. \n\nI can hear it now, moving around upstairs.  It knows my eyes will be watching the door, so it\u2019s looking for another way in.  I\u2019m so scared.\n\nI\u2019m the reason Scott\u2019s dead.  My true love.  And I\u2019ll never forgive myself for that.  The thought of that is far worse than anything that monster can do to me.\n\nOh God, it\u2019s here!  \n\nThe old fucking laundry chute!  Goddammit!  \n\nWHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU?!?! \n\nIt\u2019s watching me with those horrifying yellow eyes.\n\nI can\u2019t keep running because it\u2019ll find me.\n\nAnd I won\u2019t put anyone else in danger.\n\nIt\u2019s me that it wants. \n\nScott I\u2019m so sorry, I love you so much.  \n\nAnd Mom, I love you so much.\n\nI\u2019m going to close my eyes now. \n\nThree.\n\nTwo.\n\nOne\u201d\n\n\nThat\u2019s it, that\u2019s the recording. It\u2019s very disturbing to me. If only you could hear her voice. She was terrified. \n\nThe police haven\u2019t been back in contact as I write this, and I\u2019m not expecting them too either. \n\nThe woman mentioned her mother in the recording, I might try and find her. Tell her what I've found, just in case the police don\u2019t believe it.",

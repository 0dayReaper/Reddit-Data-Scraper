    "postText": "I survived to write my side of things, but not everyone did.\n\n------------\n\n\u201cHow much of your family are you willing to lose?\u201d the Leech hissed.\n\n[I struggled against his arms, but the Leech\u2019s grip was firmer than a duck\u2019s watertight asshole](https://redd.it/13t5tbb). My fingers tingled from where they hung helplessly at my side. \n\n\u201cSo you can *choose*, Kim,\u201d the thing gurgled at my wife. She stood still, arms at her sides, the car headlights illuminating her silhouette next to the \u201cRoute 1913\u201d signpost. \u201cGive Ella to me, and I let your husband walk away with you. If you take too long to decide, I rip hubby\u2019s torso in half before killing you and taking your daughter.\u201d\n\nKimmy, my headstrong and very fucking stubborn wife, balked. \n\nThat scared me more than anything. \n\nI had very recently learned that her boldness was not confined to interior design arguments and BDSM roleplay; she had supernatural abilities that I was only beginning to comprehend. \n\nWhich meant her hesitation revealed she believed, at least in part, that the Leech\u2019s words were true. She knew he might overpower her, and that there was a very realistic chance our daughter was about to be taken no matter what she chose. So I did the only thing that made sense.\n\n\u201cHey guy,\u201d I huffed. \u201cAre you getting riled up by this thing you\u2019re doing to me and my wife? Because you\u2019re pressing yourself up against my hips, and there is *nothing* subtle about your libido right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuss, *please* don\u2019t antagonize him,\u201d Kimmy begged, her voice laced with terror. \u201cPlease let me handle this.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I will,\u201d I answered. \u201cJust as soon as I\u2019m done.\u201d Turning to face the Leech, I stared into the darkness of his head.\n\nGod *damn*, I wish I hadn\u2019t done that. It was like looking into a kaleidoscope of sadness. His entire face was black, but not because it was shrouded in shadow. The best explanation I can offer is that light couldn\u2019t exist where his head was. I shuddered. \n\nClosing my eyes, I focused on what I had been saying before. \u201cI might not be able to stop you from shredding my guts, friend, but I\u2019ll be a fucked pig if you think I\u2019m cool with you getting off on the idea.\u201d\n\nHe hissed and pulled me tighter still.\n\nJust like I knew he would.\n\nThe downside was that I could no longer breathe. The upside was that his erect penis was now pressed into my open palm. \n\nI grabbed the appendage and twisted like I was trying to open a pickle jar for Kimmy that wouldn\u2019t budge. That actually happened once, and I watched her face go from thinking \u201cmy husband can take care of this\u201d to \u201cmaybe my infant daughter needs to take over.\u201d \n\nI realize now that my two-year-old is orders of magnitude stronger than I am, but I did not have this information at the time. \n\nSo I pulled on a depth of strength that I didn\u2019t know I had as I squeezed the pickle jar. The effort resulted in a little shit nugget squirting directly into my underwear, but I got the jar open, so it was worth it. Besides, it was Kimmy\u2019s turn to do the laundry. \n\nI turned with the same effort now as I twisted the Leech\u2019s ding dong, feeling a blood vessel burst in my eye. \n\nHe dropped me, and I fell to the ground like a sack of wet cement. \n\nThat was all Kimmy needed. I still didn\u2019t understand exactly what she was or what she could do, but I knew she was deadly. \n\nI felt fire, and I closed my eyes. \n\nThe silence terrified me more than anything, because I knew that one of them had died instantly. Heart racing, I opened my left eye I first, wanting and not wanting to see who remained. \n\nWarmth spread through me as I saw Kimmy standing over the dark Leech. That warmth turned to hot nausea when I realized she was holding his head like a rotten pumpkin that dripped foul liquid onto his decapitated body below. I\u2019ve been with Kimmy long enough to know that I need to give her space when she\u2019s angry, so I crawled back toward the car to check on Ella. Propping myself up on my elbows, I looked into the back seat. \n\nShe had gotten ahold of the golf clubs I leave in the back, and was bending my nine-iron like a pool noodle. I closed my eyes and sighed.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re safe,\u201d breathed. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for that. The clubs are replaceable.\u201d \n\nElla giggled and farted.\n\n\u201cAre you finished doing stupid shit?\u201d \n\nI shot into a standing position, shocked at the voice in my ear.\n\n\nKimmy stood face-to-face with me.\n\nI sighed with relief and hugged her, but she remained frozen. Pulling back, I met her eyes. I was worried that I would find anger there, but saw only the purest kind of fear.\n\n\u201cDo you realize how lucky you are to be alive after pulling that stunt?\u201d she whispered in a high-pitched voice. \n\nHeat ran up my neck. \u201c*No,* Kimmy, in fact I don\u2019t. Do you know why I don\u2019t? It\u2019s because you\u2019ve been hiding *every important thing about yourself*. So I can\u2019t say how dangerous it is to fondle Leeches or punch Malverns because *you\u2019ve kept me in the dark.* If you\u2019re going to be pissed at someone, look in a mirror, Kimmy.\u201d\n\nShe closed her eyes and forced slow, steady breaths. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Russ,\u201d she answered quietly.\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\nKimmy opened her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re right. This is my fault, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat don\u2019t you understand?\u201d\n\nI scratched the back of my head. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019ve never heard you say that I was entirely blameless.\u201d\n\nAn awkward silence hung. \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just agree that we\u2019ve both been wrong in the past,\u201d Kimmy conceded. \n\nI didn\u2019t contradict her, knowing this was the best offer likely to come my way. \n\nShe folded her arms, hung her head, and rested her face in her hand. \u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry, Russ. I convinced myself that we could have a normal family, and once I accepted the fact that I was lying to myself, I wanted to keep living that lie as long as I could.\u201d \n\nKimmy dropped her hands to her sides and gave me the saddest look. \u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHere\u2019s the truth about my family [and our daughter](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).\u201d\n\n---------\n\n[Her fucking family](https://redd.it/145xoik)\n\n----------\n\n[BD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/)\n\n\n\n[W](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcn_pa1QfNMRzbTuJqXSoRQ)\n\n[E](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/)",

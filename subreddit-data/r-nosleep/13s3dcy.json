    "postText": "I stepped onto the front porch holding out the hope that there\u2019d be a basket of pastries and cookies; There was nothing there. It had been two weeks since the Gibsons had popped by. The Gibsons, our neighbors from the farm next to us, sported several more acres of land than our family and with how amazing the early elderly couple were, they deserved it.\n\nMelvin and Maya baked together, even as Melvin\u2019s mind slipped it was one of the only things he could remember from his 37 years of marriage with Maya. They always brought us lots of their baking, and in turn we all would help them out with things around their farm. Maya\u2019s mind was sharp, even if both of their bodies were giving out. It was the least we could do for such lovely neighbors.\n\nSo when more than a week had passed with no calls or basket drop-offs, I knew something was wrong.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going? Sun\u2019s almost down,\u201d mom asked me as I threw on some boots.\n\n\u201cCheckin\u2019 on the neighbors,\u201d I replied, stone faced.\n\n\u201cOh I\u2019m sure they\u2019re just fine, their son and his wife were supposed to be visiting, right?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t have a real response to that. Something felt wrong, but maybe I was expecting far too much from them. If they had family over I shouldn\u2019t be so bent out of shape.\n\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right,\u201d I relented. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s just that-\u201d\n\nSirens rushing down the road cut me off. They were headed west. Towards the Gibson\u2019s farm.\n\n\u201cWhen was the last time you heard those around here, ma?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cFive months,\u201d I got back. The reality did hit me. We were roughly twenty minutes south of Albany, and I probably haven't been to Atlanta in maybe three months. I was grateful for my online friends, let alone having the internet in the first place.Which is why I\u2019m writing what I\u2019m writing.\n\n\u201cJonah, where are ya going?\u201d I heard my dad call out to me as I hurried into the truck. He\u2019d been watering the tomato plants outside.\n\n\u201cCheckin the Gibsons!\u201d I called back.\n\n\u201cDammit, you\u2019re gonna look silly when you crash their family bbq cause you was worried!\u201d\n\n\u201cExplain the cops then!\u201d I retorted before slamming the truck door and speeding west.\n\nMelvin and Maya\u2019s place was ten minutes away by vehicle. I had the windows down, and around the halfway mark I heard gunshots. I picked up speed, thrashing the poor truck on the dirt road.\n\nI didn\u2019t wanna be right, but sure as shit there were two cops and an ambulance parked outside of their place. I got out of the truck and rushed over. The law enforcement and paramedics were a little jumpy, and very pale.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on..?\u201d I asked much slower than I normally would. The sheriff looked back at the house, and that\u2019s when I noticed the window had been smashed. The frame of the window was torn right off the house, too.\n\n\u201cAn attack of some kind,\u201d The sheriff told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a gnarly scene there, kid. We suspect a-\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t bullshit him you saw it, too!\u201d a much younger deputy called out. \u201cThat thing\u2019s a monster!\u201d\n\nThe sheriff sighed, giving this visibly shaken deputy a pat on the back. \u201cWe\u2019ll see to it that someone destroys it.\u201d\n\n\u201cA monster!?\u201d I spat. \u201cY\u2019all can\u2019t be using that word lightly!\u201d\n\n\u201cA big one, too,\u201d the deputy rambled. \u201cDamn thing took six of my bullets before it charged into the woods! I didn\u2019t wanna believe it! Bigger than any bear I\u2019d ever seen, and I damn well know it ain\u2019t one!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are you anyways, kid?\u201d the sheriff asked. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here, it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe neighbor,\u201d I said, pointing back down the road towards my house. I gestured to look around back, and I followed the sheriff and his deputy closely.\n\nThe Gibson\u2019s crops were torn up in some spots, uprooted to be specific. There was a trail of blood smeared across a section of the field that led to a busted portion of their fence, trailing towards the woods and swamp. I wanted to check for tracks, but I was no detective nor would the police let me get close.\n\n\u201cI\u2026did they make it?\u201d I asked nervously. The sheriff shook his head, looking down at his badge shamefully.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe so, son. Couldn't find a body to tell ya.\u201d\n\nI bit my lip, trying my hardest not to cry. I walked back to the truck and drove off. I couldn\u2019t hold anything back and cried for most of my drive back to my place. I grew up with them always down the road, and they were kind and gentle souls. It was the type of loving marriage I envisioned myself having later in life.\n\nMy parents had finished eating dinner by the time I had gotten back. I quietly scarfed down some food on my own before telling my parents what I had seen. They were upset, for sure.\n\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t find a body?\u201d My dad asked. \u201cThat means that there\u2019s a chance they might be alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to believe that, I do\u2026but the amount of blood that was there\u2026\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could\u2019ve survived that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do about it, son? You can\u2019t go and fight this \u2018monster\u2019 or whatever that they said they saw.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were good people. I can\u2019t do nothing about it, pops.\u201d\n\n\u201cLive a good life, for them at least. They\u2019d definitely want that for you.\"\n\nA couple days went by, and I saw some vehicles pass our place to their property a few times. It was pretty quiet. I worked around our smaller farm, and helped my parents bring food to the nearby markets. Eventually their obituaries presented themselves in the newspaper.It was cited that Melvin, Maya, and their son and their daughter in-law all died from a bear attack. This ignited a fire of conviction in me. I wasn\u2019t a sheriff or deputy or whatnot, but a \u201cbear attack\u201d was bullshit. I had to get to the bottom of it.I cared about the Gibsons. I wasn\u2019t going to give up until I found out what really attacked them.\n\nI drove to their property, much to my parents dismay, and saw nobody was there. Someone had boarded up the broken window, and I saw a toolbox laying about on the front porch. I hopped the fence behind the house and saw the smeared trail was drying up. Something was off, more of their crops were uprooted. There was also a vile smell in the air.\n\nWhatever the thing was, it was here recently. I was also able to find some tracks.\n\nHooves. Larger ones at that.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t be a killer deer,\u201d I chuckled to myself.\n\nI circled back around the house and noticed something shocking on the side I hadn\u2019t seen yet.There was a fresh trail of blood smeared towards the woods. Who was here recently that this thing killed? \n\nI took a look and saw a small broken window that was halfway through being boarded up. Looking down at the trail, there were once again hoof tracks leading away from the house. I saw some torn denim, soaked in blood on the ground, as well as a screwdriver.\n\nThis thing killed whoever was patching the place up. I was too scared to follow the trail, I was unarmed.I checked the nearby barn that held their sheep and goats. They were massacred, dried blood everywhere. The only remains of any animal was in the form of a rotting goat carcass that was missing its backside.\n\nIn my disgust I thought of an effective but risky plan. I took the carcass back to my truck and drove back to the house.\n\n Mom and Dad always were in bed early, and they were deep sleepers by 8:00pm. I did make an effort to be quiet with my sneaking, as I looted our compost, and added in some of the fresh tomatoes to my bucket of slop. I unlocked the gun safe, got the highest caliber hunting rifle, and loaded myself up with a handful of bullets. I grabbed a high powered flashlight for good measure, too.\n\nThe sun was still in the sky when I got back to the Gibson\u2019s place. I took the carcass to the back of the house, dropping it on the blood trail. I dumped the compost slob on top, as well as the fresh tomatoes for extra measure. By the looks of it, the bait may not have been necessary but I wanted to speed things along.I managed to navigate the intact wooden railings on the back porch and climbed on top of the roof. \n\nI got a view of most of their field, which was almost completely ransacked. I took out the gun and waited.\n\nNothing came for two hours. The moon was full with a clear sky; I didn\u2019t even need the flashlight I brought. Disrespectful as it was, I also peed off the house towards the carcass. That was not part of the plan, but a part of me was glad I did.\n\nAbout twenty or so minutes later I heard something from the woods. I quietly got the gun ready. It was a bear, and a pretty big one at that. No bear could\u2019ve done this, right? It began sniffing where I had peed, as well as the bait I had laid out. I wanted to fire off a warning shot to scare it off. It was interfering with the \u201cmonster!\u201d\n\nAs I prepared to fire off the gun, I heard a low grunt and snort from the woods. It was loud. Sounded like a wild boar, but not quite. I heard the sound of something slowly dragging through the underbrush. The bear noticed it, too, and ran away. A bear was running from something like a boar? What the hell?\n\nIt emerged from the woods and I understood why.\n\nIt was a massive boar, I\u2019d argue it was taller and heavier than the bear. It didn\u2019t have the thick hair your average feral pig had. No, it had a bristly mane but almost no hair on the sides. It looked like it had been stabbed or shot, its hide had dark, exposed holes. I could see from the moonlight that its tusks were stained with what I could make out was blood.\n\nIts bloated gut dragged on the ground, and the thing wheezed each step it took. It reached the bait. Did it notice me? I took aim.\n\n The thing began to heave and hack. First, a slew of blood and bile came from its mouth. It looked like it was struggling. Then something else came out of its mouth that will no doubt be burned into my brain for the rest of my life\n\n.A set of flailing human arms.\n\nThey swayed as this creature heaved some more. More blood came out. The arms were hung up in its mouth, and tapped desperately on the snout. Oh god, the person it ate is still alive!?\n\nI took aim and fired into its side. It gurgled and shrieked. It spat out more content that made me lose hope. \n\nIt opened its mouth wider and a slimy, half digested torso dropped onto the ground. It wasn\u2019t done yet. It shook its head and the arms that were stuck in its teeth flung away.\n\nIt kept puking. A hammer, a half-melted hardhat, and two severed human legs came out of its mouth. It went back to the pile and began to gorge. This thing was simply making room.\n\nNo doubt, this was the monster.\n\nFurious, I took another shot at it. I got it right in the ear. It squealed, and turned its gaze upward. Its cold, beady eyes locked onto me. I slowly began to back up, reloading another bolt into the rifle. It snorted and roared. It reared up at me, its oversized gut weighing it down. It began pacing from side to side, before charging towards the house.\n\nIt pressed its massive body against the house, and I could\u2019ve sworn I heard some creaking from the wall. I took another shot at the top of its head, it drew blood, but I doubt it went close to the brain.It looked up at me, opening its massive, disgusting mouth. I instinctively gasped when I saw what was inside:\n\nIt was glinting in the moonlight, the gem on Maya\u2019s wedding ring. My body must\u2019ve moved on its own, because I don\u2019t remember putting the flashlight in my hand, but before I knew it I turned it on and I couldn\u2019t believe what I saw in the light. \n\nThe ring was attached to a slimy, mangled arm resting at the back of this thing\u2019s throat. This monster pig ate her!\n\nI screamed in terror and in rage and fired a shot into this thing\u2019s mouth. It stumbled backwards, squealing and rolling. Its insides were still vulnerable. As I shakily went to reload, I realized I had ran out of bullets! Shit!\n\nThe giant pig squealed and roared. It took a few steps and began to retch once again. It vomited up Maya\u2019s body, in pieces, before retreating into the woods. I could hear its gut dragging along the ground.\n\nI was distraught, I could tell through the disgusting, slimy and bloody body that this was indeed one of my neighbors. It was far more gone than what I can only imagine was the gentleman who was patching the windows up.\n\nI made it home, and my mind is still a bit hazy. I don\u2019t think anyone is going to believe me when I tell them what killed our neighbors. I want to call the sheriff, hell even the military over. I cared so much about our neighbors in life, I want them to rest easy in death.\n\nMy parents didn't even come out to scold me, they must have really been sound asleep. I wonder if anyone else heard the gunshots. Our other neighbours are fairly far out. My ears are ringing, my heart won't stop beating, and my mind is racing far too quickly to fall asleep.\n\nI knew it wasn't a bear that devoured our neighbours. I wish it were so simple, but I wish nobody had to die in the first place.\n\nIf there's more of those things out there, then I'm worried for us. When will that thing turn its attention towards our farm?I\u2019ve been staring at my phone for about an hour now, ready to make a call.\n\nI\u2019ll be able to help them out just a little bit-[By guiding them to the newest trail of blood, going into the woods.](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowAwaytheCJ/submitted/)",

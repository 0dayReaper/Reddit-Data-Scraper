    "postText": "I sat in the overstuffed chair, twiddling my thumbs and crinkling my nose at the rich aromas of the room. The psychiatrist\u2019s office was a symphony of overwhelming and conflicting smells. Sandalwood incense mingled with Dr. Loyd\u2019s cheap aftershave and the heavy tang of cigarette smoke. A faint but identifiable odor of ammonia, probably cat piss, seemed to follow him when he walked through the door.\n\nMy body shifted uncomfortably in the chair and I adjusted the patch over my right eye. The empty socket beneath throbbed with low but singing pain. I had lost the eye, useless as it was, two weeks earlier, and the pain medication didn\u2019t seem to take the edge off. The stitches under my left eye didn\u2019t hurt as badly, but the itching, swollen skin was maddening.\n\nThe smells made my eye water, but it was easy enough to play off. He thought I was upset about our sessions, and that was natural enough. Most people who see a psychiatrist probably cry for valid reasons. No one goes to see a shrink because things are going well. Not that things were going well for me either, but no, it was the smell of the piss and smoke and aftershave. It nauseated me.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t his fault, though. I\u2019ve been blind for the past twenty years and my sense of smell could get a bit overwhelming. Not that it was any more developed than anyone who had their vision, but I was just much more aware of it. I leaned into the senses I still had, sometimes to my benefit and sometimes to my detriment.\n\nComplex dishes never tasted as good when I still had my sight, likely because I didn\u2019t stop to enjoy the taste. On the other hand, my sense of touch is a mixed bag. A chair with rough fabric would drive me mad as the cheap fibers snagged on the dry skin of my fingers.\n\nGive a little to get a little, I thought.\n\n\u201cMatthew, are you listening to me?\u201d Dr. Loyd said suddenly. \u201cWe only have an hour each day and it will be difficult for us to make any progress if you don\u2019t talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, Doc,\u201d I stammered. My lips curled into a half smile as I fought back the urge to mention the smells. He wouldn\u2019t think it was funny and it would most likely hurt his feelings. \u201cI just get lost in thought from time to time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand, but let\u2019s do our best to stay on track. The district court and your case worker have given me five sessions to determine whether or not you remain a risk to yourself or those around you and I don\u2019t want to send back a vague\u2026 or blank report.\u201d\n\nI sighed and straightened myself in the chair, imagining the smell of a freshly cut lawn to clear away the odor of the room. My mouth opened and I began to talk but nothing came out. My throat felt dry. Tears were welling in my remaining eye. Not the tears from the room's smell, but heavy tears of terror and anxiety. I wanted to explain myself to Dr. Loyd, but I was at a loss.\n\n\u201cYou cut yourself, Matthew. When the officers found you, you had removed your right eye and had begun to cut out your left. If they hadn\u2019t stopped you, I\u2019m not sure you would have survived the ordeal. Both of the doctors from Western State Psychiatric report that while you were polite and compliant during your seventy two hour hold, you didn\u2019t tell them very much. Talk to me, please. What caused you to hurt yourself?\"\n\nI sat for a moment, collecting my thoughts. Nothing I was going to tell him would make sense. Being returned to the mental hospital seemed almost inevitable.\n\n\u201cI suffer from traumatic optic neuropathy. A man hit me in the head with a pipe as I walked back to my dorm from class twenty years ago. The police said he must have mugged me since when they found me, my wallet was gone. I woke up in the hospital without my vision. The doctors said both optic nerves were damaged and they weren\u2019t sure if my sight would come back. Two decades later, I can tell you it is seeming unlikely.\u201d I laughed uncomfortably.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Dr. Loyd responded. \u201cThat is all in your report that I have here. What I am failing to understand is why you attempted to remove your eyes.\u201d\n\nI sighed as a new wave of hot tears poured down the left side of my face.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been blind for twenty years, Dr. Loyd. Sometimes, though, I can see again. Just little glimpses. At first, it\u2019s just a pinhole of light, but it grows. When it is finally bright enough for me to make out what is in front of me, I see terrible things. I don\u2019t want to see them, Doc. It\u2019s terrible. After the last time\u2026\u201d I paused, gulping deeply. \u201cI tried to use my pocket knife to cut out my eyes.\u201d\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\* \\*\n\nThe first time I saw the small light was eight years after the attack. I had managed to finish my master\u2019s degree and landed a job as a high school counselor. The first year or two was a bit rocky, but I found my stride. It took me longer than a lot of people to come to terms with their blindness, and it caused me to carry a chip on my shoulder. The students, who I expected to give me hell over my disability, were strangely amazed at my ability to live my life without sight and embraced me quickly.\n\nDarron McNeil was one of my favorite students at the school. He had grown up in a rough neighborhood and had a loose affiliation with a local gang. Most of his teachers didn\u2019t enjoy having him in class and as a result, I ended up mediating a lot of conflicts on his behalf. We met three times a week for two years to develop and maintain a graduation plan for him. I was continually impressed with how far he had come.\n\n\u201cMs. Evans don\u2019t like me, man,\u201d Darron said, leaning close to my tape recorder. I always recorded my sessions to allow myself additional time to make notes. \u201cI worked my ass\u2026 I worked my butt off on that paper and she still gave me an F!\"\n\n\u201cDarron, you wrote a pretty astounding amount of four-letter words in the paper. I spoke with Ms. Evans and she has been impressed with your improvement in class, but she is concerned about your ability to decipher appropriate language choices. Do you think any better choices were available to you?\u201d\n\nThe young man sat silent for a moment and I could hear him tapping his hand on the wooden arm of the chair. It was a nervous tic he had developed as his ability to control his temper had increased. When we first met, he would scream and cuss when you challenged him on an issue, but over time, that anger had dwindled into the nervous hand tap.\n\n\u201cMr. Lindsey, she gave us an assignment to write an autobiography. You always tell me to be my authentic self and that\u2019s what I did. Man, at school, I try and follow the rules. At home and with my boys, we don\u2019t talk all proper and shit like we do here. I can\u2019t be authentic and act like\u2026\u201d\n\nDarron was still talking, but my attention was stolen away from him by the sudden bright pinhole of light blooming in front of me. I fixated on it and my heart raced. The doctors had told me, however unlikely, that my vision could return. There had been rare cases of vision suddenly returning years after massive head trauma. I wanted to laugh, to cry. I wanted to tell Darron what was happening and share my sudden joy, but the light was so mesmerizing I couldn\u2019t look away.\n\nThe pinpoint of light began to swell, first to the size of an apple but soon bloomed to the size of a beach ball. It was beautiful and\u2026 for lack of a better word, blinding. I didn\u2019t squint my eyes though, no, I kept them open and soaked in the magnificent glow.\n\nDarron\u2019s voice was still in the background, faint and almost forgotten. The light had covered my entire field of vision and the outline of a silhouette was slowly taking shape. A young man with rich, dark skin came into focus. His hands moved passionately to emphasize every point he was making. The red of his jacket and the blue of his pants blossomed into existence.\n\nIt was Darron McNeil, the student I had known so well but had never seen. He was there in front of me, talking rapidly, defending his position with passion and fury. His eyes were locked on mine and I could see their intensity.\n\nAs I opened my mouth to tell him I could see him, I was shocked as four shadowy figures began to walk toward him from the incredible brightness behind him. I expected to see their features become more defined as they moved closer, but they were nearly standing behind him and were still nothing more than colorless voids.\n\nThe figures halted behind Darron and looked forward at the wall just behind me. They turned their faceless heads toward each other and nodded in acknowledgment before looking down at Darron. Suddenly, the shadow men began to shake subtly in place, moving like staticky pictures on an old black-and-white television. Their movements became more violent and erratic before they finally froze in place again.\n\nWithout warning, all four of them lifted their arms toward Darron, guns in hand. The light gleamed and danced over their surfaces. Fear boiled over and I opened my mouth again, this time to scream, just as the guns discharged, riddling the young man before me with bullets. He went limp and the chair tilted to his right, dumping him on the floor.\n\nI screamed and pushed myself back from the desk, preparing to run to Darron. Without warning, the light before vanished and I was washed over in total darkness again. As I tried to make my way around the desk, my foot caught a corner leg sending me sprawling onto the floor. My face connected with the cheap, thin carpet, and my thoughts became a swimming mess.\n\n\u201cMr. Lindsey, are you okay?\u201d I heard a voice say loudly, fighting to penetrate the volume of my panicked wails. It was Darron. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, man? You just freaked the fuck out!\u201d\n\nDarron helped me off the floor and back to my desk chair. I sat down heavily and rested my face against my hands. My mind raced as I tried to make sense of what I had just seen. I wanted to explain it to him, to assure him I was fine, that I had just had a hallucination.\n\nBut who would believe a blind man had seen anything?\n\nI sent Darron back to class and promised to catch up with him later. My pulse was still hammering and I felt like I was on the verge of a panic attack. The rest of the day was spent with my door closed, head down on the desk, breathing deeply, and trying to assure myself that everything was okay. It had just been some strange medical event.\n\nI slept fitfully that night. My dreams were filled with shadowy figures hovering behind Darron, but he wasn\u2019t in my office anymore. He was walking down the street, headphones running from his ears into his jacket pocket. His head bobbed rhythmically to the beat of unheard music as the dark things stalked him.\n\nAs he crossed an alleyway, four bright licks of flame erupted in the darkness and Darron fell to the ground. Blood pooled around him as his glassy eyes stared up into the streetlight overhead. An earpiece had fallen out of his ear and soft music drifted through the nightmare.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*You know, I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead*\n\n*Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight? (You don't know?)*\n\n*Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?*\n\n*Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?*\n\n*Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI awoke the next morning feeling haggard and thin. The smell of my breakfast made me feel like I would vomit, so I scraped the eggs and toast in the trash and opted for a few cups of black coffee. The thermos was nearly empty by the time I walked into my office and slid myself behind my desk. I had just settled in the seat when I heard a knock at the door.\n\n\u201cMatthew, do you have a moment?\u201d said a deep baritone voice. Mr. Harlow, the principal.\n\n\u201cSure, have a seat. I\u2019d offer you some coffee, but I\u2019m about out.\u201d\n\nThe legs of the chair snagged the carpet, filling my ears with the sound of sputtering fabric. Mr. Harlow sat down hard on the seat, his suit jacket rustling against the arms. I could hear the wet click of his mouth multiple times as he started and stopped, trying to form the message he wanted to give me.\n\n\u201cI spoke with the school resource officer this morning, Matthew. Something happened last night. Darron McNeil was shot and killed as he walked home from a friend\u2019s house. I know he was one of your clients here and I just wanted to say I am\u2026\u201d\n\nHe kept talking but I was no longer listening.\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\* \\*\n\nIt continued that way for years. Infrequent, but equally horrifying. Brief moments of light followed by a horrific scene I was powerless to stop. Visions of hateful creatures circling the soon-to-die like vultures waiting for a meal.\n\nAnd who the hell could I tell? Psychiatrists would think I had lost my mind and there would be no way to prove it. Even if I could, there was no value in being correct. I never had a clear picture of what would happen until it was too late. Always a vague vision of the back figures mimicking how someone would die just so they could\u2026 what? Taunt me? Torture me?\n\nSometimes there would be dreams, but I was sure they were no dreams at all. Somehow I was seeing the thing as it happened. Watching these people die.\n\nFour over the past twelve years. Darron was first and it mentally broke me for a while. I took a leave of absence from my job and when I returned, I had to transfer to another school across town. The place felt tainted and I couldn\u2019t sit in that office for one more day.\n\nThe second was an old lady at the supermarket. It was nearly two years after the first. We chatted idly as we waited in line to pay for our groceries. The light bloomed and the shadow men appeared. I could see the frame of a sweet, crook-backed woman as she chattered on about her grandchildren. As she continued, a large shadow swept in from the right and left her withered body, bent and broken, on the tile floor of the grocery store in front of me.\n\nShe asked if I was alright. I was aware I had started to cry. I smiled and assured her I was fine before leaving my basket of groceries and walking out of the store.\n\nHer name was Helen Bennett. She was a seventy two year old grandmother of seven. Loved by all that knew her, the reporter on the evening news had said as he described how the drunk driver had driven over her like garbage. She was crossing the street with her groceries. Hit and run.\n\nThe third was Marie. Darron was difficult, but Marie was the hardest. She was the love of my life. We met at the new school where she taught AP physics to disinterested juniors and seniors. Three beautiful years together. We were due to be married in six months when the little light appeared behind her.\n\nWe were eating dinner and she chirped happily about work and our impending trip to visit her parents in Vermont. A single dark figure began to grow in the distance, walking slowly toward Marie. I wanted to tell her, but I knew there was no way she would believe me. Instead, I decided to concentrate on what I saw and try to find a way to stop it.\n\nOnce the dark thing had stopped behind her, it lifted its hand and the long black fingers danced around her temples. For the first time, I could see her beautiful face, and I was sickened that it was framed in the obsidian hands of that awful thing. I fought back tears, watching the creature intently for the smallest clue of what may happen when it suddenly slipped a finger in each of her ears.\n\nShe stopped talking and her eyes glazed over. Her face went slack and she began to lean slowly toward the table until her weight became front heavy and her head slammed hard on the table. I looked down at her and saw a trickle of blood drip from her nose.\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\n\u201c... so we will need to get going around nine or so.\u201d she said, her voice suddenly back in focus.\n\n\u201cMarie, I need you to listen to me. Something is wrong and we need to go to the hospital right now. I don\u2019t want to scare you, but we need to get you to the ER and get you a CT scan. I will explain everything after we get there, but please, go get your shoes on and I\u2019ll call a cab.\u201d\n\n\u201cMa... Matthew?\u201d she stammered questioningly. \u201cWhat has gotten into you?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, please,\u201d I said as calmly as I could. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll answer every question you have, but we have to go right now.\u201d\n\nWithout another word, she stood from the table and walked to our bedroom to get her shoes. I called a local cab company and asked them to send over a car as soon as they could. It was a struggle to maintain a calm demeanor, but just that once I felt as though I had gotten ahead of the nightmare. Standing from the table myself, I headed to the bedroom to get my shoes and jacket.\n\n\u201cThe cab is on the way,\u201d I said, heading toward the closet. \u201cThank you, Marie. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve scared you but I\u2019ll try and explain as soon as we are there.\u201d\n\nI had almost reached the closet when my foot bumped into something heavy on the floor. Nearly tripping, I reached out and steadied myself on the wall. My stomach dropped as I knelt down and felt the soft fabric covering Marie\u2019s back. I traced my hand quickly up to her face and felt the trickle of blood.\n\nA brain aneurysm, my coroner told me. Usually not so sudden, but in Marie\u2019s case death had been immediate.\n\nShe didn\u2019t suffer, he said. An attempt to comfort me, I\u2019m sure.\n\nBut I did. I knew it would happen and wasn\u2019t able to stop it.\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\* \\*\n\nThe last one was just a few days before the police found me on the street. I was foolish enough to think whatever it was had finally gone away, but no such luck.\n\nMy life had fallen apart. Depression had overwhelmed me and I finally quit my job. Going to school reminded me of Darron and Marie. I filed for Social Security Disability Insurance and moved into a smaller apartment that was easier to afford. I couldn\u2019t even make myself go to the grocery store or a restaurant for fear of seeing the shadow men spring from the light behind some random person. I ordered almost all of my meals to be delivered. Takeout caused minimal contact. If I didn\u2019t see people, I was unlikely to see that small bloom of light.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I ordered a pizza. As usual, I told the young woman on the phone to have the delivery driver just put it on the ground outside the door and knock. I would go out and get it after they left and sit in solitude as I listened to the TV and ate.\n\nA half-hour after I placed my order, there was a gentle knock at the door. I waited a moment, counting to thirty in my head. That was the loose rule I had established. Let them knock. Count to thirty. Retrieve the food. It would be enough time for them to be far away from my door.\n\n\u202627\n\n\u202628\n\n\u202629\n\n\u202630\n\nMy knees popped loudly as I stood from the recliner and shuffled through the living room. The hinges of the door squealed as I opened it. I was just getting ready to kneel and find my pizza when a brilliant pin of light bloomed in front of me.\n\n\u201cSorry, my dude,\u201d said a gravelly voice. \u201cI think I may\u2019ve brought the wrong pizza and I wanted to check\u2026\u201d\n\nI slammed the door. There was another gentle knock.\n\n\u201cSir, I just wanna see if I brought you the right pizza. I know it said to knock, but\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cJust leave it on the floor. I don\u2019t care what it is. Just put it down and go away. Go home and don\u2019t go out. If you feel sick, go to the ER. Dammit! Why did you have to be outside the door?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you okay, man?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet the hell out of here!\u201d\n\nI heard footsteps padding down the hall and what I\u2019m certain was the driver mumbling what a crazy asshole I was. Panic consumed me and I was gasping for air like a man who had been held underwater. My knees grew weak and I collapsed on the floor in front of the door.\n\nWhen I was finally able to move again, I stumbled to the bedroom and climbed in bed. I fell asleep and drifted into a dream of an overweight man sitting in a recliner. He wore a bright red polo shirt with the embroidered emblem of a local pizza place. There was a needle in his hand and he slipped it carefully into his skin before depressing the plunger. He smiled peacefully and put his head back against the backrest, closing his eyes, his body going limp.\n\nI watched as his body began to shudder lightly. Lines of vomit streaked from the corners of his mouth as he continued to shake. His chest began the heave heavily before slowing and finally coming to a rest.\n\nIt was the pizza man from my doorway, I\u2019m sure. I guess it was heroin, but I\u2019m not certain. Either way, I watched a stranger overdose on his recliner and choke on his vomit.\n\nIt was more than I could handle and I didn\u2019t want to see anymore.\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\*\n\n\u201cThat is very interesting, Matthew,\u201d Dr. Loyd said, sounding less convinced than concerned. He scribbled wildly on his notepad. \u201cI can only imagine that having sudden hallucinations after years with no sight would be horrifying. While I\u2019m no expert, there is a condition called Charles Bonnett Syndrome that..\u201d\n\n\u201cNo disrespect, sir, but it isn\u2019t Charles Bonnett Syndrome. What I\u2019m seeing, however horrible, is real. I went for a walk that night to clear my head but I just went deeper into a spiral. The only solution I could think of was to\u2026 well, you already know how the cops found me. I don\u2019t want to see these things anymore.\u201d\n\nI thought I heard Dr. Loyd chuckle. There was no way to be certain, but I was fairly sure. And it pissed me off.\n\n\u201cMatthew, I know these things can feel very real, but I want to assure you that they\u2026\u201d\n\nI held up a hand in his direction and he stopped talking. Adjusting myself in the chair, I turned to face him. His breathing grew shallow and I heard the click of his pen as he retracted the point and placed it on his desk.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re balding with a scraggly mustache. There is a yellow spot on the collar of your sweater; mustard, I think. You wear glasses. I believe the frames are gold, but it\u2019s hard to see.\u201d Dr. Loyd sat in silence. \u201cDo you smoke?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I do\u2026 but how\u2026\u201d he stammered, but didn\u2019t finish his sentence.\n\n\u201cAbout five minutes ago a small bead of light appeared in front of me and you\u2019ve slowly come into focus. Two dark creatures are standing beside you right now and their hands have drifted in and out of your chest dozens of times. It seems close to your lungs.\u201d\n\nThe last thing I remember before the world went black again was the horrified look on the doctor\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cI think you need to find some [help.\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtripp14/comments/uyezti/making_it_easier_to_keep_track_of_my_new_releases/)",

    "postText": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13u9t3m/my_father_always_kept_the_shed_locked_today_i/Part 1: \n\n\nThe darkness around us was oppressive, cloying and total. Anywhere we weren\u2019t pointing our flashlights would turn into a solid wall of black, impenetrable shadows. But we could hear *something*. As we walked further down the hallway, we heard soft footsteps and giggling.\n\n\nSometimes, it sounded like it came from directly behind us. At other times, it would come from the rooms all around us, the endless rooms that split off the hallway on both sides. We found some strange things in those rooms as we walked slowly, the gun raised in my hand and the bowie knife raised in my brother\u2019s.\n\n\nThere were corpses in some of the rooms. Many had partially mummified in the dry, chilly air down here. Others were clearly fresher. One woman was hanging from the rafters with a note pinned to her chest. I looked back at Gil when we reached this part of the hall. We had stayed out of the rooms since the incident with the little boy, but some deep innate curiosity needed to know what was on this note. Gil nodded at me, and we walked forward side by side, scanning every corner of the room and looking behind smashed-out fish tanks and torn sofas covered in black mold for any signs that we weren\u2019t alone in here. Once we were both satisfied, we returned to the young woman hanging in the center of the room.\n\n\nShe had somehow climbed up to the ceiling, opened a panel and found a sturdy enough beam or rafter to tie the rope to. Yet there was no ladder or anything remotely tall enough to reach the ceiling nearby. It was somewhat of a mystery. I explained this to Gil, who looked somewhat confused- and alarmed. He clearly hadn\u2019t realized it until I pointed it out to him.\n\n\nI turned back to the woman\u2019s corpse, picking off the note, which had been stuck into the front of her blouse with a huge wooden splinter. Gil kept a look-out while I read, shining his light back and forth in a circle across the room, holding his ridiculously huge knife in the other hand like some sort of medieval swordsman. I saw with increasing horror that the note appeared to have been written in the woman\u2019s own blood. Looking at her body, I saw a deep slash on her left arm, one that had clotted days ago. I looked back down at the desperate message this dying woman had left for us.\n\n\n\u201cTo anyone who finds this,\n\n\n\u201cMy name is Michaela Mansfield. I came in here by accident through the sewers underneath the town of Caplin. My two friends and I went exploring and got separated after a girl in our group twisted her ankle. I went forward alone to find help while my other friend stayed behind with the injured girl. After perhaps a day of being lost, my flashlight started to die, and I thought I was going to die with it. And then I saw fluorescent lights up ahead. They were flickering and looked like they might sputter out at any moment, but it was the only hope I had. I followed the lights and found myself in this hallway. When I tried to turn around and go back, the entrance to the sewers had disappeared. It was just a hallway that seemed to extend forever, the one that has haunted me for weeks now.\n\n\n\u201cPlease, if you find this note, tell my parents what happened to me. Take my golden locket and return it to my mother and father as proof. I hope you have better luck getting out of here than I did.\n\n\n\u201cGoodbye, and may God forgive me for what I\u2019m about to do.\n\n\n\u201c-Michaela.\u201d\n\n\nI looked up at Gil, with one eyebrow raised. I saw he had been reading the note over my shoulder rather than keeping a look-out. I sighed, deciding not to say anything.\n\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t take the locket,\u201d I said. Gil shook his head.\n\n\n\u201cWe have to take the locket,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to think we had something to do with this girl\u2019s death if we just show up randomly with a piece of her jewelry. Actually, I think I remember when this girl and her friends went missing. It was on the news. Her parents were pleading for anyone with information to come forward. I think the cops were acting on the suspicion that it was murder or kidnapping or something. But they probably just went exploring without telling anyone and never came back.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll wipe it down and send it anonymously through the mail with a note explaining what happened,\u201d he said. I sighed, giving up. He was right. It was the right thing to do. But I\u2019m sure many innocent men have gone to prison over trying to do the right thing. I pointed to the note.\n\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t help us at all,\u201d I said. He shrugged.\n\n\n\u201cMaybe it does, and maybe it doesn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t really help us formulate a plan, but it does give us information. For example, now we know that this place probably connects to a lot more places than the shed. We might be able to get out through dozens or hundreds of exits. If it connects to a random sewer over in Caplin, then it could connect to places all over the county.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTrue,\u201d I said, \u201cbut what if it connects to some alien world? Or to a black hole? What if it connects to some point in the void between galaxies and we get sucked out to our deaths?\u201d He simply shrugged again, seeming apathetic to these possibilities.\n\n\n\u201cWell, in that case,\u201d he said smugly, a half-smile forming on his lips, \u201cour deaths would probably be a lot quicker than they would at the hands of these creatures down here.\u201d Then he started laughing. It sounded eerie in this dark, forlorn place, where everything smelled like yeast and the floors were all wet substrates growing strange jungles of alien molds. He reached forward and took the golden locket off of the woman\u2019s neck, placing it carefully in his pocket. We started walking out of the room together.\n\n\n\u201cAlso,\u201d I said, \u201cthe note seems to imply that the entrances are temporary. She couldn\u2019t find her way back out after she got in here. What if they\u2019re all like that? What if they\u2019re like\u2026 I don\u2019t know, lobster traps, or Venus fly traps, or something? They draw people in here, and then once they\u2019re inside\u2026\u201d I stopped speaking as soon as I realized I heard someone following us.\n\n\nI heard running footsteps. A high-pitched giggling started, then was cut off. We both stood there in the darkness, our flashlights pointing forward. Then the voice of that demonic little girl started up, high-pitched and somewhat inhuman-sounding. Her words all had a strange hoarseness to them, an uncanny valley sound as if she were only imitating human emotions and human speech.\n\n\n\u201cAdam\u2019s \u2018It\u2019, but he won\u2019t play,\u201d she said sulkily, her voice bouncing off the walls, the rapid beat of the footsteps approaching nearer and nearer. \u201cHe says his throat hurts. So I guess I\u2019m \u2018It\u2019! You better run!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGod dammit,\u201d Gil said, swinging his giant knife around from side to side as if he were going to bat a mosquito with it. His light flashed and wavered as he tried to keep a watch on all sides. But I knew she was coming from behind us. I could feel it. I kept my light shining down there, the gun raised, trying to emanate a calm I didn\u2019t feel. Then I saw a flash of blue, zigzagging crazily past a chair leg and the snapped remains of a folding table, tiny legs pumping at a superhuman speed. She looked like little more than an approaching blur.\n\n\n\u201cListen to me very carefully,\u201d I said, trying to keep my gun pointed on her. \u201cWe need to cut off her head.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Gil said. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLast time, bullets didn\u2019t work on\u2026\u201d I began, but then she was on us, no more than a few feet away, jumping over the discarded junk that intermittently appeared on the sides of the hallway. And then I felt myself knocked over by a tremendous force that took the air right out of my lungs.\n\n\nI still had my hands crossed in front of me, one holding the gun and the other the flashlight. The skeletal face of the creature was mere inches away from my own, biting and gnashing madly. I could see small muscles in the back of her mouth working furiously. She was pushing down on my arms with all of her strength, which was far more than such a small body seemed to suggest. \n\n\nThe gun was pressed closely to the front of her chest. I was about to pull the trigger when I felt the weight start to lift off of me. I saw Gil behind her, wrapping his arm around her neck and pulling her back. She still gnashed and bit in a mad frenzy, small droplets of blood and saliva dripping off her mouth and into my face. She kicked her body back and forth like an enraged snake, freeing her neck from Gil\u2019s grasp. He went to grab her, and her skeletal face opened up wide, the jaw hanging halfway down her neck.\n\n\nWith the speed of a cat snatching a mouse, she leapt forward, snapping her jaw around some of the fingers on Gil\u2019s left hand. I saw his index and middle finger disappear into her mouth, and he began to scream in agony.\n\n\nI was scrambling back to my feet by this point. I ran at the girl, using all of my body weight to push her. She went tumbling on the floor, her mouth flying open as she landed hard on the wood. Two mutilated fingers flew out, rolling across the floor and disappearing into a dome of black mold. I was sweating heavily now, drops of perspiration rolling down my forehead and stinging my eyes. I tried to wipe them away, thinking of what to do. My mind screamed at me to shoot, to empty my entire magazine into this little monster, but I knew in my heart that it would just be wasting bullets. Deep down, I knew what I had told Gil earlier was true- we had to cut off her head. Just like in the old myths of vampires or demons, I had a deep instinctual feeling that fire or decapitation would be the only way to deal with her, and as for fire, we had no flamethrowers.\n\n\n\u201cGil!\u201d I said. \u201cGet ready!\u201d He was holding his spurting hand tightly against his chest, still grasping the bowie knife in his right. His face was alarmingly pale and white, and I wondered if he might not just pass out right here and doom both of us. But he hadn\u2019t dropped the knife, even while fighting the writhing monster, even while getting his fingers bitten off. He is stronger than he looks, I reassured myself. \n\n\nA sense of calm and clarity overcame me then, and I saw what I needed to do. The demonic girl was getting up, growling and spitting and laughing. I ran over and stomped on her back, putting my full weight on her body to drive her back down. Then I took the pistol and shot her through the back of the kneecaps, one bullet for each.\n\n\nShe wailed as dark red blood poured out of her small legs, turning her head almost all the way back to try and bite me. Her hands were changing, the small fingers lengthening and darkening into sharp, black claws, and I knew our time was running out.\n\n\n\u201cNow!\u201d I yelled, and Gil ran forward, using his right hand to swing the bowie knife. I watched it fall in a descending arc, as if in slow motion, watched it approach the spitting skeletal face that looked at us with black eyes and unfathomable hatred. It went clean through, and was so sharp that for a split second, the head stayed there, the face blank, looking like it was still attached to the body. Then it tumbled forward, dark blood spurting out of the neck and staining the white and gold molds underneath with its crimson hue.\n\n\nGil fell back against the wall, breathing fast. He dropped the bowie knife on the floor. I saw his flashlight, still on, had rolled against an ancient wheelchair that was probably new back in the 1960s. I stopped and grabbed it, shoving it in my pants belt so it would give me more light to work with. Gil still had his hand clasped to his chest. Slowly, I put my hands forward and grasped his injured hand by the wrist. He inhaled deeply, gritting his teeth and closing his eyes.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to need to wrap it in something,\u201d I said. He nodded. I took off my shirt and started ripping long slices from the bottom, then wrapping them around his hand tightly in an attempt to slow the bleeding. When I got to the fingers, he flinched and seemed to waver on his feet. I reached a hand out in case he was about to fall over, but he managed to steady himself. \u201cAll done,\u201d I told him as I put my shirt back on, which was missing the bottom third portion now and looked rather absurd, almost as if I was wearing a woman\u2019s crop top.\n\n\n\u201cIt feels like my hand\u2019s on fire,\u201d Gil said in a hoarse whisper. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need water, too.\u201d I was feeling the start of dehydration pangs myself.\n\n\n\u201cThat girl, Michaela, her note said she was stuck in here for weeks. That must mean there\u2019s water. Assuming her counting was correct, seeing as there\u2019s no sun or sky to go by. If there was no water, she would have died after a few days, especially being on the move,\u201d I said. I was hoping that we would find food as well, but it wasn\u2019t really life or death. I knew that we could potentially go weeks without food and still live, even though it would feel extremely unpleasant and weaken us physically. I sighed, shining my flashlight at Gil.\n\n\n\u201cReady to keep going?\u201d I asked, and then the lights started turning back on. Most of them were still either out or flickering on and off rapidly, but enough of them were lit to see down the hall.\n\n\n\u201cOh, thank God,\u201d Gil said. \u201cAt least now we\u2019re not walking through this junkyard in the fucking dark.\u201d Up ahead, I saw something new as well. It looked like the hallway forked off. I pointed at it, and Gil\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cFinally, after walking for endless miles, this place does something!\u201d As we neared it, I saw there was even a sign. One pointed left, reading, \u201cTo Veriden\u201d. The other pointed right, reading, \u201cTo Rusty Township\u201d.\n\n\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of either of those places. They\u2019re definitely not in the county.\u201d Gil\u2019s dark brown eyes looked past me, into the room behind us, and they widened. I reached for the pistol, turning quickly, but I found nothing but a mostly empty, half-lit room. Against the corner was a vending machine and a soda machine.\n\n\n\u201cOh thank God!\u201d I said, running forward, reaching in my pocket for some money. Then I remembered I had left my wallet at home. After all, I thought we were just going into the shed. Gil strode right past me.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot,\u201d he said, taking the butt of his bowie knife and smashing the glass of the vending machine. \u201cYou don\u2019t need money. Who\u2019s going to call the cops, the walking undead and demons here?\u201d He pulled out brands I had never heard of: Overholser\u2019s Beef Jerky, chocolate bars with caramel and peanuts called Eisenhearts, Took\u2019s salt-water taffy and Riza\u2019s fruit snacks. The other vending machine was no less alien, as I smashed it with the butt of the gun and found Springy\u2019s Lemon-Lime Soda, Kanna-brand cola and Saint Kristoff\u2019s Ginger Ale, among others. Not one of the brands was recognizable from our world.\n\n\nWe tore into the food with ravenous hunger, chugging bottle after bottle of soda. It all tasted similar enough to what we expected, though some of it was rather strange. The ginger ale, for example, had small silver shavings on the bottom of each bottle, their trademark gimmick, and Gil swallowed them and nearly ended up choking. I smacked his back hard, laughing.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re supposed to drink those,\u201d I said sarcastically. We were filling up our pockets when the drumming started from down the hall. It was so sudden and loud in the otherwise perfect silence that I jumped nearly a foot, spinning around and taking out the gun. It was becoming second-nature to me by this point, and so much adrenaline was constantly pounding through my body that I was as jumpy as a cat.\n\n\nThe drumming grew louder and fast. It reminded me of the drums some ancient Aztecs must have used when cutting out the hearts of prisoners of war. It had a deep, primal beat to it that would be useful for stirring people up during acts of savagery and violence. It was coming from the direction labeled \u201cRusty Township\u201d. I could barely hear myself think over the intensity of the drum beats. I tried to motion to Gil that I would go first since I had the gun but that he should stay right behind me, but he looked like he was just smiling and nodding and likely hadn\u2019t understood a bit of what I was trying to communicate. Sighing, I started forward down the corridor.\n\n\nI peeked my head around the next corner, where a doorway opened up into a huge gymnasium. The ceiling towered over me. I saw dirty, disheveled people standing in a semi-circle around a metal coffin that was stood up on one end against the back wall. Blood was pouring out the bottom, following a river of clotted gore that stretched across the gymnasium and curved off to the right corner. The people surrounding the metal coffin were laughing, clapping their hands and cheering, stomping their feet in time with the beats. I saw scurvy blossoms and festering sores across their faces and exposed skin. And, for the first time since we had gotten lost down here, there were windows around the edge of this massive chamber, windows showing the outside world. I ran over, looking out.\n\n\nI saw a city on fire, the buildings burning and sending up thick, black plumes of smoke. It reminded me of what Berlin at the end of World War II must have looked like. Fronts of houses had collapsed inwards, the streets were cracked and filled with debris and I saw bodies hanging from lampposts up and down the street. Many of them were so old that the ropes were starting to fray. Some of the bodies had started to mummify, with thin, papery skin clinging tightly to desiccated muscles and hanging jaws.\n\n\nAround the corners of houses and alleyways, I caught glimpses of strange shapes: crouching half-animal, half-human beings who carried sledgehammers and long knives, robed figures who seemed to float over the devastated and cracked ground, and children with red skin who I saw crawling up walls on all fours like geckos.\n\n\nThe drums stopped as suddenly as they had started. My ears were still ringing. I turned back to the semi-circle of sickly, dirty people. They had stopped their clapping and dancing and cheering, and now just stood like statues, staring at Gil and me with flat, dead eyes.\n\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t stare into the Township,\u201d a thin woman with filthy black hair said. A strange accent crept into her words, one that I had never heard before. \u201cStrange things live in there, and they come out when the drums stop.\u201d She stepped forward, whispering. \u201cWe keep them away by giving a sacrifice every time the drumbeats come. The blood satisfies the ones in the city and the others in the halls. We will all have our turn in the coffin, sure enough.\u201d \n\n\nAnother member of their group stepped forward and opened up the metal coffin. I saw long, thin spikes sliding out of a body, and then a pale form fell out, landing on the dirty floor with a wet smacking sound. The smell of coppery blood in the air was now overwhelming. Gil and I both gasped in unison as we saw this form on the floor was a person, a young woman in fact, almost totally drained of blood. Dozens of puncture marks were sliced into her face, neck, stomach, legs and arms. An expression of pain and horror was frozen onto her dead face, her wide, staring eyes looking up at the ceiling.\n\n\n\u201cYou killed her!\u201d Gil said, aghast, still clutching his mutilated hand close to his body in an unconscious gesture of his anxiety and fear. \u201cWhy? Why would you put someone from your own group in an iron maiden?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIron maiden?\u201d the woman with the black hair in front responded. \u201cAye, that\u2019s as good a name for it as any. We call her the steel mistress in my world, in my time, and the steel mistress sees a lot of use\u2026\u201d She gestured out the window, her face emotionless. \u201cYou see my world, after all. It is a place that always reeks of death, and more often than not, reeks of fire too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat part of the United States is this?\u201d Gil asked, gesturing out the window. The woman frowned.\n\n\n\u201cI do not know these \u2018United States\u2019,\u201d she said, shrugging.\n\n\n\u201cWhat country are you from?\u201d he asked.\n\n\n\u201cWhy, Victoriat, of course. But Victoriat only has three states. Rusty Township was the capitol, until \u2018twas attacked by the Black Hand Allegiance soldiers. We\u2019re all refugees from Rusty here,\u201d she said sadly.\n\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t getting us anywhere,\u201d I said to Gil under my breath. He nodded, sighing.\n\n\n\u201cCan you tell us how to get back to the stone steps? Big, circular stone steps that go around and around?\u201d Gil asked the woman in one last attempt to get a sensical answer out of her. She nodded her grimy face.\n\n\n\u201cAye, in the center of the Undergraves,\u201d she said, pointing past the iron maiden and the dead body on the ground. I realized that there was a sign up on the ceiling in front of the next corridor, one pointing left and saying, \u201cTo Rusty Township center\u201d and one pointing right and saying, \u201cTo the Undergraves\u201d. The sign was so covered in dust and specks of black mold that it was no wonder I hadn\u2019t seen it.\n\n\n\u201cDo you have any maps of this place?\u201d I asked the dirty woman and her friends. They all shook their heads.\n\n\n\u201cThere are no maps of the Undergraves, but the stairs be at the center. You just take a right here and follow the path straight. Ignore all forks to the right or left, just keep following it straight\u2026\u201d We were walking away fast now, trying to leave these lunatics behind. \u201cBut you\u2019d be mad to go there now after the drums just stopped!\u201d Her voice was fading rapidly as Gil and I ran forward.\n\n\n\u201cThose people were fucking nuts,\u201d Gil said. \u201cKilling each other just because they think the blood keeps away demons.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cBrother,\u201d I said through heavy breaths, \u201cif you and I lived down here for a few months, we would be just as crazy as those people.\u201d \n\n\nAs we jogged into the Undergraves, I realized the walls were turning into something organic and pulsating, like being in some huge intestine. Massive forks to the left and right appeared every few hundred feet. From them, dark shapes appeared, stepping forward. They moved shakily, blurring as they stepped to the right or left randomly, their mouths opened wide and seeming to be filled with blackness. Their eyes looked like pure black sockets, and the rest of their body was no more than a shaky silhouette of shadows. When the first few stepped forward, I didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\n\nI gingerly raised the gun, deciding better safe than sorry. They were coming at me fast, jerking randomly, their skin seeming to writhe and shiver as I stared at it. As they got within ten feet of me, a deep burning heat started to fill my body, as if I were standing in front of an oven. I started shooting, one bullet for each of their center mass, and they dissipated into smoke. I watched the black stuff curl back into the red, pulsating room they had just come out of. The sense of heat dissipated instantly, but my skin still felt warm and strange.\n\n\nWe were running through the Undergraves now. Miles of slick gore covering the floors, strange tissues growing across the rooms and tumor-like sacs covering the fluorescent lights, which even here flickered endlessly across the ceiling.\n\n\nIn many of the rooms, I saw people strung upside down from the ceiling, their ribs sliced open. Strange, hunched figures sliced the meat into strips, preparing it and drying it. One of them looked at me with its pig-like face, its bovine legs walking across the sticky floor, slowly and uncertainly at first, and then running for me. I was running low on ammunition by this point. Gil came from behind and disemboweled the creature as it raised its butcher\u2019s knife. It had been so focused on me that it hadn\u2019t noticed him jogging up with his blood-stained bowie knife in one hand.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t run much longer,\u201d Gil said, panting. I nodded wearily. Neither could I. \u201cMy hand is still on fire, too. I really should have gotten medical attention, like, twelve hours ago\u2026\u201d\n\n\nPart of me wondered if the stairs were even here, or if we had been lied to, sent into the worst part of this strange hall to become sacrifices to these abominations. We had, after all, put our lives in the hands of a band of lunatics.\n\n\nBut at this point, we had nowhere else to go but forwards.\n\n\nPart 3: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/141o1g3/my_father_always_kept_the_shed_locked_today_i/",

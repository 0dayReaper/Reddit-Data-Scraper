    "postText": "My high school is in Michigan. It is a respectable size, and most of the teachers are friendly. I have a limited circle of friends, and we frequently engage in conversation. My friends and I met up at the high school entrance on what appeared to be a typical day. We discussed things like Crushes, anime, and other boy-related topics that girls wouldn't understand. As we walked, I caught sight of a shadow figure peering out of the janitor's closet door and observed that it was slightly ajar. I dismissed this because the janitor might be the only one responsible.One of my buddies asked, \"Hey, have you heard about that new horror movie coming out?\"\n\n\"Yeah! I want to see it but-\" said the other friend,\n\n\"Your parents won't let you,\" I said.\n\nI waved them off as they made their way to their classes. I arrived for my math class, Calculus 1 if anyone is interested. I took a seat and flipped open my textbook. I enjoy math, but I despise calculus. \"Don't like calculus, Mark?\" my teacher asked after I let out an audible grunt.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"I detest calculus.\"\n\nHe giggled a little and grinned. The only positive aspect about calculus was my calculus teacher. He was a fair-weather humorist. He delivered his customary lectures, pausing every now and again to tell us a joke when...... The lights went down. In our class, a girl shrieked as the lights went out. Everyone looked up at the intercom in anticipation of hearing anything, but nothing came through.\n\n\"That is strange,\" my teacher remarked, \"Um.\"\n\nWe were all fixated on our teacher, who was perplexed. The weather was sunny. How could a storm form so quickly? What led to this disruption? My mind was spinning from all of these ideas.\n\n\"Mark? Could you please visit the office? questioned my teacher,\n\n\"Yes, I could accomplish it.\" I answered.\n\nI got out of my seat, unlocked the door, and entered the strangely silent hallway. I'll admit that it made me feel a little uneasy. I was on my way to the office when I noticed that the previously partially open janitor's closet was now entirely open. I started to hear footsteps behind me as I was moving. I turned around in search of... nothing. I thought that was strange, but I was given a mission to fulfill, so I did (in hindsight, that was a foolish choice). I was only able to hear my own footsteps. I hurriedly glanced around, feeling uneasy after hearing the footsteps. When I eventually arrived at the office, nobody was there. I rang the bell and opened the door, figuring the office ladies would be in the rear, but after five minutes, no one appeared. My body began to feel dread, and I had no idea why. I started to scan the area when I noticed a figure standing at the doorway. I backed up a step out of terror. It simply stared at me without saying anything.  Though I couldn't see its face, I could tell it wasn't a human. After a minute of waiting, I raised its arm and pointed at me, and the figure stated, \"They watch.....\"\n\nI used this opportunity to rush by it. I sprinted back to my classroom along the hallway. I smashed through the door and shut it quickly. My teacher asked, \"What happened? \", and I replied, gasping for air. \"I saw something that wasn't human,\" I said. Before the lights came back on, I turned to see a shadow pass by the classroom window. I spun around to look at my teacher's startled expression. And he noticed it.\n\nWhen the intercom blared, my teacher asked, \"What was that?\" The person on the other side of the intercom stated, \"We were having some technological issues. You are all dismissed because our security staff finds the school to be unsafe.\n\nWe all fled the building. The events of that day still bother me. I discovered afterwards that a kid had been killed at the institution ten years earlier for some sort of ritual. Whatever the thing was that caused the power loss, I think it wasn't an accident. Please let me know if you have any theories about what might have happened.",

            "comment": "Given that they just wanted to spook you, and created darkness, I'd wager you're dealing with a Mare. They're spirits that detest light, and love fucking with people. And if someone died there 10 years ago, especially if in a ritual, then they probably felt a lil spooky after they died.\n\nI joke, but Mares will totally kill you, so like. Don't piss it off. Maybe keep a non-electric light source on you, as well",

Although I knew there were ghosts and demons, I had no idea there were other kinds of spirits. Every time I pass the janitor's closet, I still have the uneasy feeling that something is lurking in the shadows and keeping an eye on me.",

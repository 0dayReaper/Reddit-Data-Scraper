    "postText": "My brother, Johnny, passed away when he was only six years old after a lengthy battle with leukemia. His death rocked my entire family, but Mom took it particularly hard. She\u2019d been adamant that he would eventually take a turn for the better. That one day, all the years of taxing treatments and costly medical procedures would finally pay off. But they never did. All the prayers in the world couldn\u2019t prevent the inevitable.\r  \n\r  \nMom became a bit of a recluse after that. She was often inconsolable, weeping for hours in the somewhat comforting familiarity of Johnny\u2019s room. Dad and I did our best to help her, of course, but her grief overwhelmed her. Weekly therapy sessions, family excursions, nightly prayer circles. Nothing worked. \r  \n\r  \nOne evening I shuffled past Johnny\u2019s room on my way to the kitchen, when I saw her sitting on his bed, silently flipping through his favorite children\u2019s book. I scanned the room, heart shattering all over again upon seeing all of Johnny\u2019s discarded toys lying exactly where he\u2019d left them. It was like a time capsule. A pertinent reminder of what we\u2019d lost. I cautiously approached Mom, choosing my words carefully so as not to upset her. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cH-hey, Mom. Mind if I sit?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nShe glanced up at me, then back down at the storybook before giving me an approving nod. I tenderly plopped down next to her as she turned to the final page. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cBut then, he nibbled a hole in the cocoon, pushed his way out, and he was a beautiful butterfly.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nA single tear trickled down her cheek as she closed the book. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cHe always loved that story. I still read it to him every night, in case somehow he can hear it.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThat\u2019s really sweet, Mom. I\u2019m sure he looks forward to it every day.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nShe gazed blankly at a mountain of stuffed animals stacked precariously in the corner. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cI miss him so much, David. What I wouldn\u2019t give for just one more second with my little boy. It\u2019s not fair! Out of all the children in the world, why did He have to take *my* baby?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nShe broke down into hysterical sobs, her languished wails echoing off the periwinkle walls. I held her for a long time, unable to prevent the tears from spilling from my own eyes. After what felt like an eternity, Mom finally wiped her face with her sleeve, and I relinquished her from my grip. We sat in silent memoriam, our sporadic sniffles the only noise to drag us back to reality. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cDavid?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYeah, Mom?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDo you remember the tiny music box Johnny used to carry around with him?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI chuckled lightheartedly. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cHow could I forget? He wouldn\u2019t let it out of his sight.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cCan you help me find it?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI cracked a broken smile. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cI sure can.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nWe searched for the music box for hours to no avail. We looked under the bed, in the closet, behind all the furniture. It wasn\u2019t anywhere to be found. We left no plushie unturned, but we still couldn\u2019t locate it. \r  \n\r  \nWe were forced to call it a night. I trudged to my room, promising Mom that I wouldn\u2019t abandon our mission. I was determined to find it. But after a week of relentless scouring yielded no results, I was beginning to lose hope. Mom, however, wasn\u2019t so quick to surrender. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cMom, I hate to say it, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to find it. We must have searched this room a thousand times over.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDavid, I know it\u2019s here. Maybe there\u2019s somewhere we haven\u2019t looked. His closet?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAlready checked it.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat about the nightstand?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI\u2019ve sifted through it countless times. Look, Mom, I think we\u2019re just going to have to accept the fact that it\u2019s gone.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nTears welled in her eyes, as the thin dam holding them back began to falter. Well stood in tense silence, Mom mulling over my words.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNo. I won\u2019t give up. It\u2019s here somewhere and I will find it,\u201d she said, a twinge of frustration seeping into her tone.\r  \n\r  \nI nodded. I stepped out, sensing that she could use some time to herself. \r  \n\r  \nThat night I again slipped by Johnny\u2019s room. The door was closed, which was a rare occurrence, but not unheard of. I pressed my ear to the wood, trying to gauge if it was a good time to pop in. That\u2019s when I heard it. The music box. \r  \n\r  \nThe all too familiar tune of Claude Debussy\u2019s \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d drifted from within, the notes floating like feathers to caress my ears with their harmonious melody. I flung open the door, heart bursting with pride for Mom\u2019s resilience. But she wasn\u2019t there. \r  \n\r  \nA deep dread began bubbling like tar inside me. If Mom wasn\u2019t producing the noise, who was? I had to pinpoint the source of that canorous tune. I began frantically turning the room upside-down in desperation. I tossed aside action figures and pillow pets, panic fueling my frenetic frenzy. I peeked under the bed, and I froze in shock. A pair of red radiating eyes glared back at me. \r  \n\r  \nShadow shrouded the entity, its loathsome stare sending ice shooting through my veins. Dim light lined a perimeter that I presumed it could not cross. But the thing that nearly made my heart stop, that awful horrid image that I still can\u2019t erase from my head, was the sight of my mother cradled in its grasp, slowly, methodically cranking the handle of the music box. \r  \n\r  \nShe beamed at me, white teeth glimmering in the darkness. I melted into the floor like I was being forced down by invisible hands. Mom spoke, each demented letter joggling in my brain like a ping pong ball. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cDavid, Johnny came home. He wants you to play with us.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThat was all my mind could take. The scene before me was simply too much to process. Blackness bathed the perimeter of my vision, and I lost consciousness, glimpsing Mom\u2019s nauseating grin one last time before I did. \r  \n\r  \nI awoke in my own bed nearly an hour later. Dad had found me crumpled on the carpet in Johnny\u2019s room. Mom was declared a missing person the next morning. Neither her nor the music box have ever turned up. Dad thinks that she may have taken her own life. That the utter hopelessness weighing on her psyche had crushed her spirit. But I know what really happened. And I pray that whatever came for her that night doesn\u2019t return to reunite us.",
